4,Even Metallica get soft!,"Okay, when I say they get soft, they are never the less harder then many other groups. But for a Metallica CD Reload is very soft. Metallica started with Speed-Metal in 1983 and have developed to a very good blues-rock band. The songs on Reload are slower and more melodic than the ones on Load. In some songs you even find country elements. Hardcore Metallica-fans maybe don't like this sound but I'm happy that Metallica dare something with their new album and don't delivre the same as last time. If you buy Reload you won't regret it.(I'm sorry for my bad English!)"
3,So-so at best,"I also own Ride The Lightning and The Black Album, and this is by far the weakest of the three. I couldn't agree more with jonathon k below. Tracks 1-5 are cool, especially ""Fuel"" and ""The Unforgiven 2"". Unfortunately, the only good song after that is ""Low Man's Lyric"". The other songs are OK at best. Also, the lyrics are terrible compared to Ride or Black. The lyrics in songs like ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" and ""Sad But True"" have great power and meaning, something that most of Reload lacks. The only song with great lyrics is, ironically, ""Low Man's Lyric"". On the plus side, this album has awesome guitar riffs and James's voice sounds creepy on many of the tracks, just as we all like it. I do not think Metallica has sold out. I think it's great that they are trying new things in their music. They are still the best band ever, and I am eagerly anticipating their next album."
1,Give me poo give me fire hey let's light a turd on fire.oooh,This album is ::Expletive deleted::. Don't buy it.
1,It's garbage.,"Sellout radio friendly trash. Just tired, pathetic pop metal. Forget this, Load and the lowest point in metallihistory S&M and get St. Anger."
2,dont load this into your cd player,"here are the 5 do nots of this albumdo not go near itdo not look at itdo not listen itdo not touch itand do not buy this album it is the sliteist bit heavy,thrash,speep metal it suks"
2,its funny how this is better than Load,"better than Load but still not enough for me to care. seriously, who cares what Metallica has to say anymore? arent we over it yet? i mean, they released 4 records that made metal what it is today, no one in a metal band can decline the notion that Metallica paved the way and in a way invented what we know today as american metal but that was 20 plus years ago, do we really care anymore?there are some decent radio hits on this cd which is what Metallica had been trying to do since 1990 and have succeeded but with time the songs on these later era releases just arent worth the plastic they are put on.im just so over Metallica and these songs.dont get me wrong tho, i love Metallica, i love the early era stuff because it still rules over most if not all metal thats around today but do they really have anything left to offer but stale music packaged as an excuse to tour?"
5,Metallica,"METALLICA SUCKS,ALL METALLICA SUCKS,EVEN WHEN METALLICA WERE TRUE METAL,THERE WERE BANDS THAT DESTROYED THEM,SEPULTURA,SLAYER,PESTILENCE,VENOM,PYREXIA,METALLICA DID NOTHING FOR THE METAL SCENE,F*CK THEM,ALOT OF METALLICA'S RIFF'S WERE A RIP OFF OF SLAYERS ""METAL STORM / FACE THE SLAYER"",THATS ALL METALLICA DID WAS RIP OFF OTHER PEOPLE AND OTHER BANDS,HOPE YOUR READ MY REVIEW,AND TAKE ALL YOU'RE METALLICA CD'S,AND SHOVE THEM UP YOUR A$$,ALL OF THEM,START WITH KILL EM ALL,THEN DO RIDE THE LIGHTENING,THEN DO MASTER OF PUPPETS,THEN AND JUSTICE FOR ALL,YOU GET THE POINT,HEHE,AND THEY RIPPED OFF A BAND CALLED EXCITER,THATS HOW THEY GOT POPULAR,THEY RIPPED OFF THAT BAND,AND EXCITER WERE F*CKING AWSOME,JUST LIKE PANTERA (GLAMTERA) RIPPED OFF EXHORDER,EXHORDER RULED,PANTERA SUCKS,SO ALL YOU METALLICA/PANTERA FANS THAT CALL YOU'RE SELVES METALHEADS,YOUR NOT,YOUR NOTHING,BTW,METALLICA IS TOURING WITH LINKIN PARK,MUDVAYNE,HAHAHAHA,HOW GAY IS THAT!!!,LOLLOLOLOL,GAY,AND LARS ULRICH IS A MORON."
2,The Stuff That Didn't Make Load,"Wow, this has got to be bad if this is a collection of music that didn't make the album Load.Good Songs: Memory Remains and SlitherOK Songs: Unforgiven II and Bad SeedBad Songs: Fuel!!! and everything else. Fuel sucks really bad. I can't see how it is a fan favorite because it gets really annoying.This CD actually may be better than Load! Wow!"
4,Good Album,Nothing really great about this album. Fuel is the best song on here. This album is good but not great. If your new to Metallica start with Ride The Lightning or Master of Puppets before you get this
2,Sh** Load,"Probably what the album should of been called. The last decent album was the Black Album, Load was alright. This one was a dud. Only a couple of songs that really showed any origionality. They go for the classic rock feel, which is fine, but they suck at it. The one thing I will give them is trying to be different, but there doing it in a mainstream way, which is not different. When this album came out I kissed goodbye to the Master of Puppets days.Kirt Hammet's solos have always been uninspiring, but there even uninspiring to fans of metallica on this album, which is alot to say. Hetfield grabs E F E F by the throat and really doesn't come up with but a couple of new interesting riffs. Lars, is, well, hitting the drum as he always had. The bass player is alright, but no Cliff Burton is he."
1,Garbage.,"I posted a review calling ""load"" the worst Heavy Metal record ever recorded.I have to take that back because this one is worse.Not one song on this record will go down as a Metallica Classic, (but that is to be expected as they have not written any classic songs since And Justice for All)and not unlike the joke of an albumn ""Load""... not one good song.I hope one day Metallica will see the error of their ways and Give Metallica back to the People who made them.Dont waste your Money on this or any Metallica CD after ...And Justice for all...not because of the Napster thing...but because they just arent any good."
2,Ohhhh Cliff why you and not kirk?,"Remember the days when you could pop in a metallica release and not skip any songs? Yea me too it's been about 14 years..... Once Cliff went away they lost it, even justice sounds thin and not as crisp and complex as master of puppets, as i told a friend if anyone of them should have died it should have been Hammet hell then you could have replace him with steve Vai and all this negative press they are getting would be non-existant. Face it Metallica could have been a modern day led Zeppelin but that ended on sept 27 1986 :(, rip cliff........listen to orion......."
1,Sound of Diarrhea,Do not buy Load/Reload/St. Anger if you're a metal fan. Those are rock radio type albums. Even Death Magnetic stinks IMO but its better than those others i've listed. Do yourself a favor and buy the first 4 albums. That's all you'll need.
5,Screw all fake 1/2 real Metallica fans!!!! THIS ROCKS!!,"Screw all you fake Metallica fans that say this album = sellout. This album Rocks in every way imaginable. If you think this album sux, obviously you haven't seen Fuel played live and see F*UCKIN' FLAMES BURST FROM THE BACK OF THE STAGE WHEN HAMMET PLAYS HIS RIPPING SOLO!! And that goes for the rest of the songs on this album! METALLICA 4EVER!! THIS ROCKS ROCKS ROCKS!!"
4,somewhat good,"Reload, where should I begin? This album is definately not metallica at their finest, yea it did have a few hits, Fuel, The Memory Remains, The Unforgiven II, these are all great summer songs, but they are not the Metallica songs your used to hearing, some songs like Fuel and Better Than You are speeding but lack that of the METAL attitude. If you like slow songs, there are a couple good ones on here, Low Man's Lyric and The Unforgiven II, but dont forget that this isnt a METAL album, its alternative. I dot know why METALLICA went this way but i believe its mainly the fault of that fat ass Bob Rock. Im sure James, Jason, Lars and Kirk arent especially pleased with the outcome of this album and the peoples responses. Then again, it does have the METALLICA label on it so again, I give it four stars.........not their best work."
2,I was really disappointed.,Advice to buyers: I am sure that You should not buy this album! You will be disappointed!!!!!!
5,Metallica can still do it,"While it doesnt sound like their 80's releases, it still has the Metallica stamp of approval. Change has been for the better from a band that keeps changing which is one of the biggest reasons I enjoy Metallica over other bands like Megadeth, Pantera, Slayer etc. is that Metallica can actually play stuff other than speed metal over and over again. I bought this album and was impressed, it should belong in everybody's collection, Metallica fan or not. Thats what makes a truly great band. I eagerly await their next album."
3,Not their best but good all the same....,"I don't know why everyone bags this album!!! I know it isn't their best album but like all their others, it kicks arse!! Just listen to tracks like ""Fuel"" or ""Prince Charming"" and you realise that the old Metallica still exists. Then listen to one of the heaviest songs ever written - ""Where The Wild Things Are"" (This song blew 2 sets of EARTHQUAKE subwoofers!!!) As always, the HALF-AND-HALF songs are present like ""The Memory Remains"", ""Attitude"" and ""Bad Seed"". The only real disappointments are ""Slither"" and ""Carpe Diem Baby""! But really, this is Metallica and Metallica is one of the greatest bands ever to walk the earth. Don't write them off because they release an album that doesn't make the cut. Leave them to their music!!!"
5,This cd is the epitome of what music should be !,"Metallica have it all. Harmony, good vocals, and amazing riffs. As far as I'm concerned, as long as there is music around Metallica will rule forever. And the fact that they are soooo sexy doesn't hurt either!"
1,This is not Metallica,"If you like the real Metallica, don't even try to listen this disgusting thing called Reload. It is nothing like the Metallica considered by many the best Heavy Metal band ever, it is some country/blues/extremely comercial horrible mixture, especially Unforgiven II. This song ruined a great music from their best disc ever. Shame upon Metallica for doing this."
2,Uninspired and lacking creativity!,"First of all, I don't think of Metallica of a band that has sold out. However, when you are as one dimensional as Metallica is, eventually your creativity if gone. ""Load"" had its moments, but ""Reload"" is bad. The best song is ""Low Man's Lyric"". There are several songs that have cool parts, but nothing on this cd is what I would call a Metallica classic. Compare: Ride The Lightning has probably 5 classics out of 8. Master Of Puppets has 8 for 8. AJ4A has 2 or 3 for 9. Black Album has 6 out of 12. Load 3 for 14. Reload bats .000. Like I said before, this is a one dimensional band and you can only do the same thing over and over for so long. Metallica is smart though, 'cause they realize that is what sell. Examples of this include AC/DC and Aerosmith."
5,Simply mind blowing.,"Why all the hate on this album? ReLoad is one of my favorite records ever. Just think about it. If people would just stop comparing this album along with Load to their first four (or five depending on how you look at things) I bet you it would be much more loved. Just think about it, if this wasn't a Metallica record but it was the exact same, what would you think about it?In any case, this has some of the heaviest pieces Metallica has ever done. Examples of this include ""Fuel"", ""Carpe Diem Baby"", and ""Where The Wild Things Are"" (the latter being one of my personal favorite songs ever.Give this a try people. Listen to the whole album and pretend it's not a Metallica disc. You'll love it."
4,No Apology.,"I really like Reload, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. This album rocks, and reminds me of a heavier version of AC/DC. I really like the faster rockers here and prefer them over the more experimental songs. I'll put them into three catagories.Favorites: Devil's Dance, Better Than You, Carpe Diem Baby, Wild Things, Prince Charming, and Fixxxer-my personal favorite on Reload(LOVE IT!).Pretty Good: Fuel, Memory Remains (press skip at the 3:30 mark), Slither, Bad Seed, Attitude.Okay, but don't do anything for me personally: Unforgiven II, Low Man's Lyric.This CD has plenty of heavy riffing and is well produced. I listen to it often. It took me longer to get into Load, but I like that almost as well now, too."
1,Metallica's worst album,"There are about 4 decent songs here, none of them really great. The rest are really bad. I don't know what happened with this CD and with Load (which is also terrible). Metallica says they were just in a ""phase"" when they made Load and Reload. Let's hope they return to greatness with their next effort."
2,"Justa heavy version of Load, Very Disappointing","I've been a Metallica fan since Kill'em All. They have put out some of the most memorable metal of the 80's through 1991. Load completely left me out in the cold. I couldn't believe my ears when I heard it. How could they do it?! What utter garbage. Reload wasn't much better. It's just a heavy version of Load, nothing more. To be honest, some of the songs were okay. I personally thought Fuel was decent but I think ""Where the Wild Things are"" is the best track on the entire album (strictly my opinion). Overall, the album is a dud from beginning to end, showing little of the musical finesse and power that is evident in their previous works. Fortunately, I haven't bought this album or Load. I borrowed it from a friend first. I wasn't going to waste money on something that could be a major disappointment. Turns out I was right. I think I'll wait until they get their collective act together before I buy any new original material from them. What a shame."
2,Get a RELOAD of this,"I think these guys are getting too soft in their songs. They're getting slow and i've relized that in the songs. James used to sing faster than this. The lyrics have changed also. Compare this: Come crawling faster, obey your master, your life burns faster, master, master. Now compare this: Hey ma, look, it's me! Now uh, what happened! What kind of lyric is ""Hey ma, look it's me!"""
1,The most disappointing album since Load for heavy metal fans,"If you're happy with the kind of music you hear on commercial radio, then this album was made for you. For heavy metal enthusiasts it is a punch in the face from our former dark masters. Skip it and spend your money on a band that still rocks."
1,Are you kidding me?,These guys used to have some guts and rule but now they are a joke. This plodding music doesn't rock at all. I guess being millionaires and having beautiful wives have taken it outta them. Pass on this garbage.
3,A Great Rock (not Metal) Record,"People are always comparing this album to Metallica's old metal stuff. To me, if you just look at it on it's own merit, it's a great straight ahead rockin' album. There are some really great songs here like Fuel, The Memory Remains and Fixxxer, and it's sure heavier and more real than some of those nu-metal and teen angst 182-something bands out there. Maybe we should be grateful that Metallica doesn't do the same thing album after album."
1,Worst Album - EVER!!!!,"This CD is HORRIBLE. I didn't think anything could be worse than Load. Not one redeeming song. If you're new to Metallica, please buy Master of Puppets or at least the Black album. You'll be much happier."
1,Metal??? No way......,"Well, this was the first Metallica album I bought, and I have to say that I was disappointed. Hearing that Metallica was supposed to be a freakin' awesome metal band I picked this up... but since I bought this album Ive heard albums like Kill em All, Ride the Lightning, MOP (their best), Justice......... those albums f#ckin kick @ss. Thats the way metal is supposed to be. 80s metal will always rule, and saying that I will continue to listen to underground 90s metal, not the 'popular' metal like this type of Metallica, or Korn(#@!!#*).... but you do have to admit.. if a band can change their style and still sell, then they must be something to notice.... I think Metallica is a great band, but they just dont make the music I listen to anymore"
2,WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LYRICS??,"what happened to the music? the lyrics? the guitar rising above all with a solo that brings tears to your eyes? all is lost, for what, for this??? metallica PLEASE stop this crap! i'm a metallica fun, i must say i won't stay one if another reload comes out."
2,What happened??,"After first hearing ""until it sleeps"", the first single off load, I didnt' really have a clue metallica went down hill. But then I heard Load, and Reload (uncreative name too,) and nearly burst into tears. What happened guys?? I gave this album 2 stars because it's a helluva lot better that that other s**t they play on mtv (and the radio, for that matter), but that is not saying much. They took out everything that made the old metallica good. AND THEY WON A DAMN GRAMMY FOR IT????? Just goes to show you were mainstream music is headed- only one band deserved an award (ok 2, if you count manson, and even HE's gone down hill) and that is RAMMSTEIN. It's a shame."
1,METALLICA NEEDS TO PULL THIER HEAD OUT OF THIER - - - ES,"I ONLY HAVE ONE COMMENT TO MAKE ON THIS ALBUM. METALLICA PUT OUT A GREAT ALBUM A FEW YEARS AGO WITH METALLICA ""BLACK"" OR ""SUBTITLED""WHATEVER IT WAS CALLED. THEY HAD GREAT SONGS SUCH AS SAD BUT TRUE, WHEREVER I MAY ROAM, NOTHING ELSE MATTERS, MYFRIEND OF MISERY AND SO ON, OH AND I FORGOT UNFORGIVEN. I DIDN'T FORGET IT I JUST WISH THE BAND WOULD HAVE FORGOTTEN TO REMAKE IT, THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE TO RUIN A GREAT SONG LIKE THAT. WELL THAT REMAKE IS MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT BESIDES THE ENTIRE ALBUM OF ""RELOAD"" AND LETS NOT FORGET THAT PITTIFUL EXCUSE OF AN ALBUM ""LOAD"". HOPEFULLY ""GARAGE INC."" BRINGS THEM BACK TO RULING AND AWAY FROM SUCKING!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,classic metallica,"I just simply like the stylings of load and reload.Of course any metallica fan knows by me saying that that i am not a TRUE metallica fan, but none the les this is a great rock album.GIMMME FUEL!"
3,Metallica Attempt A Return To Form.,"Re-Load is actually a lot better than the first Load. They got some of their heavy metal roots back and some of the songs are faster paced. They got some of the speed back, it also has some slower and heavier songs like Where the Wild Things Are and Devils Dance. Fuel is another good hit but The Memory Remains is one of my all time favorite Metallica songs. Re-Load is heavier and has less southern rock in it but it would never live up to their classics from the '80s. Bands change and aren't going to make the same thing with every album but Re-Load has a lot of what Load was lacking."
4,metallica still has it,"fact: metallica does not sound like they used to...but guess what? that is a trademark of a great musician. the ability to evolve. if every album had the excact same tempos, beat changes, riffs, etc then all of their albums would sound the same; so who the f u ck would want to listen to album after album of the same material? unlike their predecessors, load and re-load does contain about half filler material which sux. initially they were supposed to be released as a two disc set. what should have happened is take the first 5-6 songs off of load and the first 5-6 off of re-load and made one killer album and scrapped the rest of the garbage songs (i.e. low man's lyric and mama said). if any other no-name band would have debuted this album or load everybody would be going nuts talking about how hard they rock."
3,"Gimme fuel, gimme fire, eh you know the rest.","This album right here is by far Metallica's least recieved CD. The best song on here is Fuel, bar none. It mixes old Metallica with new in the best way possible. The other good songs are Devil, Lyric, and Charming for humor. That's IT. Unforgiven II is lyrically very good, and musically countryesque. Therefore, it's not for me. This is another album of the guys messing around with the pedals and other stuff to try and make a good sound. This was Metallica's last real album to this point, until the new album comes out late this year or early next year. Hopefully, as Lars and James say, the new one will once again be different: Heavier and edgier. I hope so. Anyhow, any Metallica fan already knows to have all of Met's albums, so they all have this one already. But for people who have bought S&M and want to get into the band, I recommend the black album to start with more than this one."
3,Slight improvement.,"Now we all know that Metallica will never play fast hard riffs anymore. Did any of us back in 1984 think that Metaalica was going to make something like ""Fixxxer?"" NO! But, times change. So, this is a slight improvement. What really is good on this album is it shows their country and Nick Cave-influence. It's kind of a darker album than the horrid Load, but there is some improvement. (The solos are getting worse, however)"
2,This is not a Metallica album !,"Metallica WAS my favourite band .That is until the released the LOAD, RELOAD series! If I could ,I would give a different name on the bands name on their two last ""junk "" albums.Is not the fact that the music is not good.Is simply not a Metallica sound.Its softer , lighter , with less and less meaning (deep meaning)From their oldest albums like ""master of puppets "" or ""ride the lightning"" Metallica had created a legend , a status , and now they are just trying to destroy it by creating this kind of mixted up -confused -meaningless -with no grace albums.If I was a member of the band and I would like to continue produce records , I would change the name from Metallica to something else.Its a Sin to use the same name on these LOAD RELOAD stuff.For regular bands this would be a great album.For metallica Its way below medium, and way out of track.If you are a real fan of Metallica , dont buy anything having the word ""load"" or""reload "" on it !"
3,Keith Coady is half right,"This album was a complete letdown. Load was an excellent hard rocking cd and I had faith that this band didnt all together suck after the black album....well this album wasnt that great. I dont like the orignal Unforgiven, so why would I like part 2? The rest of the album did have weird stuff, it didnt pan out but at least they tried it. Ill give it an anther spin to see how it goes."
1,Lackluster and Uninspired,"Whether or not Metallica sold out following ""...And Justice for All"" is debatable, but the fact of the matter is that this group no longer has the fire that drove them to produce their brilliant earlier works. Reload is the emobodiment of Metallica's newfound complacency. They don't push that extra ten percent, and it shows in the bland rythm sections and inconsequential lyrics. Metallica must have got bitten by the alt rock bug pretty badly."
2,Pretty bland but the well known songs rock.,"This is albums starts out with about 3 or 4 really cool songs but then goes downhill from there.The only good songs on it are the ones they play on the radio.And Unforgiven 2 was never a big hit because it SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!I think this is a waste of money to buy an album with only 3 or 4 decent songs.What happened to making great albums like Master Of Puppets,And Justice For All and The Black Album?"
1,I'll spell it out for you,"................SELL-OUTS................... Don't buy this cd these people don't know what there talking about. As is apparent by the cds they buy: Megadeath, Korn, Nirvana(no taste here) and tool."
1,One Star Because it is the lowest available,"I don't think Metallica should use the prefix ""Metal"" in their name anymore. This is more like ""Grungtalica"" or worse ""Post-Grungetalica"" or the more popular title ""Alternica."" This title is not even metal, with the exception of the only good song ""Fuel."" If you want to get a good metal/thrash album, get Metallica's first four albums. If you really want something from the ""nineties,"" get Countdown to Extinction by Megadeth or get the Pantera albums. Even the Iron maiden albums with Blaze Bayle are ten times better than this garbage. Just do yourself a favor and do NOT get this album. If you really want Fuel, buy it on I-tunes or download it or something, just don't buy this album."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! JST CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO IT!,"THIS IS THE BEST CD OF MY COLLECTION, WELL I ONLY GOT 15 OF THEM THOUGH, BUT I LIKE EACH AND EVERY SONG ON THIS CD, JUST AMAZING CD. NEVER BEEN A METALLICA FAN BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS CD."
4,"Metallica has matured, but they can still kick some @$$","Anyone who is familiar with Metallica's earlier recordings can tell that the band has been through somewhat of a metamorphosis. They have gone from being strictly heavy metal to playing a wide variety of songs. Tracks such as ""Fuel"" remind the listener of the Metallica of old, while ""Low Man's Lyric"" and other songs have exposed the band's more mature side. Perhaps the band members have been affected by the passing years and the realization that there might not be much more time to start a family. My review sucked (I don't know what to write.) Re-Load was not one of Metallica's best albums, but it still spends plenty of time in my CD player."
3,Better than Load.,"Well here we are again. Re-load. Well first off I will state that it is better than Load and its faster. For me, its a two sided album. I like hard rock so some songs on here I like (Fuel, Memory Remains, Unforgiven II) Some songs I really really dislike. It just seems this album was put out to be put out. Metallica, never sold out, they just experimented and when you experiment you are bound to have success and failure. For me this album is half and half. Its a good rock album, Barely decent hard rock album. And a far cry from their old days. Metallica has the possibilty to make slow songs sound bad ass (Fade to Black) I guess they just lost it on this album. Its not an essential album for a Metallica fan but it is a good rock album."
4,Solid Album. Not a classic... 31/2 stars,"This album was the first metallica album for me and i liked it (not on the same level as Justice, black, master or ride the lighting). Fuel is an awesome song.. the memory remains has a nice bluesy sound to it... unforgiven 2([bad]).. but most the rest is OK... at least 3or4 star album. THE REASON WHY REVIEWERS ARE GIVING LOAD & RELOAD 1 STAR IS BECAUSE THEY ARE BASING THERE JUDGEMENT ON THE OTHER CLASSIC METALLICA ALBUMS: (IE And Justice For All, Master of Puppets, Ride The Lighting, Kill Em All and Black). ITS A SOLID ALBUM!..."
2,Where's the inspiration?,"Another uninspired group of songs thrown together. Sure, the CD is slightly heavier than Load, but first off, not much, and still, no more inspiration. Fuel is a great way to start off the album, just like Load, they started it off hard, but let it dive. Starting with The Memory remains it's just more songs just simply put together with nothing behind them, Unforgiven 2 is a slap in the face to the origional song. It doesn't get better until Fixxxer at the very end of the CD, just more weak attempts at putting something out."
3,"Pretty much on level with ""Load""","""ReLoad"" starts off with a bang (Fuel), and ends with another bang (Fixxxer), but what's between is a mixed bag. The standout tracks are Fuel, Memory Remains, Unforgiven II, Carpe Diem Baby, Low Man's Lyric, and Fixxxer, but everything else sounds like filler material. It's not that bad, but it's not that good (just like ""Load""), and I hope Metallica goes back to their thrash roots on their new album like Megadeth just did with ""World Needs a Hero""."
4,True Fans Listen to the worth,"While yes, the better albums for Metallica remains Kill em ALl and the 80's thrash, the newer bluesier sound takes theband AND its listeners back to the band's youth. In my opinion, Metallica isn't gone, some of the new tracks from ST. Anger have alreadyt shown us that, its just that LOAD and RELOAD were albums meant to take us to and show us into the youth and feelings of the band, how they expressed there feelings when all there was, was the blues and southern rock. To those who claim that LOAD and RELOAD were filler albums, I say that you need to reevaluate your fanship and learn that softer isn't always ""not heavy metal"" it's attitude that counts."
5,METALLICA'S RE-LOAD IS BETTER THAN YOU!,"This is another masterpiece from METALLICA! Every song on this album is worth listening to! This is yet another flawless album for METALLICA! My faviorates are: Attitude, and Fuel! If your a TRUE METALLICA FAN, then you need this album! If your an ""old school"" METALLICA trendy, then don't get it, and keep bitchin' about how METALLICA""supposively"" sold out..."
1,Words are meaningless,"By now everyone actually knows what Metallica used to be, and what they turned out into in the 90s. Screw that...What I would really like to see, is a personal music CD collection of a person who rates this abortion of an album 5 stars. I'd really like to talk to him or her, to know what they have been listening to in their lives, how their musical taste evolved, what they like and dislike, and what other CDs by Metallica grace their CD-shelves.That's about all the interest that this album arouses in me.So the obvious verdict is this: excellent Metallica started with ""Kill'em All"" and ended by the black album. Buy all 5 of them.PS ""Unforgiven 2"" is quite good, though. Download it through a PTP service, so courthouse-lawsuit-happy Mr. Ulrich has another $15 lost! I hope he won't sleep. :)"
1,Is this MetallicA?,"Ok, so MetallicA went past there mid-life crisis which was the horrible Load. They spent more time wearing eyeliner and posing in horrible,dumb,ugly photo sessions, instead of writing killer riffs and brilliant toughtful songs. If this album was a movie it would have the Tag Line ""Just when you tought the Mid Life crisis was over""How many bad songs can you have on one album? the answer is 13. 13 Horrible songs, and a butchering of Unforgiven with Unforgiven 2. A Chore of an Album."
2,METALLICA I love you guys! but why this?.....,"A message for Metallica, stick with the good old music! You ARE my favorite band. Your first 4 albums are CLASSICS! what did people call the rest? Sellouts. I hate it when people insult you but these new albums need to be forgotten. YOU STILL HAVE TIME TO IMPROVE just don't waste it.-Carlo de la Rama I gave you 2 stars 'coz I like you guys"
1,A CLASSIC SELL -OUT CASE!!!,"Wash!!!! METALLICA must be made a classic study in universities around the country, for explaining how such an once-great metal band succumbed so easily to commercial pressures to sell out.HOw such a bunch of nice, friendly, aggressive and creative rock (or metal) musicians like Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett and Newsted became such obnoxious characters, full of arrogance, painting their finger nails, destroying their own music, and being unable to accept any critics.... and all this coming from the guys who said, back in the eighties: ""WE WILL NEVER SHOOT A MTV VIDEO""... Well, maybe James meant he would never shoot ""one"" video, but a lot of them, ha, ha!!RELOAD is made of the footage left over in the LOAD sections. If LOAD is already a disaster, imagine RELOAD.."
1,What would Cliff say?,Soldoutica - Wussica - MTVfriendlyica - Getarealbassplayerica - Larsisanidiotica - Watereddownica ---- Please just quit now! I'm so tired of spinning in my grave!
3,"Not good, not HORRIBLE, just.....ya","Well since the kind of music I like basically died in the 80's I am really starved for good music and got desperate enough to buy some songs off reload. Now Load sucks except for king nothing and maybe another song. ReLoad does not suck as much. Fuel, and 2 other songs are o.k. everything else is FILLER. It is not good at all. And Fixxxer is just slow and boring for 8 mins."
3,"Not a repeat of ""Load"" and yet not a return to what we're used to","The Metallica fans are divided, with some saying Metallica has evolved and others saying they betrayed their fans. Make no mistake: ""Reload"" sounds nothing like ""Master of Puppets"" and bears only a passing resemblance to ""Load.""The album is distinctly heavier than its namesake predecessor, yet tries to maintain its feel by including softer songs like ""Low Man's Lyric"" (a good track in its own right, but I digress). What this amounts to is a bunch of songs, some of which are great and some immediately forgettable, all tossed into a blender and put on the album in whatever order they came out. The album doesn't flow well, a cardinal sin when coming from the same people who brought us ""Master of Puppets"" and ""Ride the Lightning.""Most of the songs are good, but the album is laid out terribly, leaving us somewhere in limbo when it comes to forming an opinion of it."
2,"Listen to ""Fuel"", ""Unforgiven 2"", then throw away!","Awful!!!! Only the first five songs save save the album... There's no salvation, they are dead! Metallica stopped at the black album. I strongly recommend ""And justice for all"", a work of art!"
1,"Oh boy, leftovers","See, ""Load"" was originally conceived of as a double CD, but then the band decided to hold off on half of the songs and release them later, hence the release of ""Reload."" In other words, open up kids, have some leftovers.Basically, what we have here is a continuation of the embarrassing boogie rock of ""Load."" I remember listening to ""Memory Remains"" the first time, thinking, ""Hey, this is actually not too bad."" Then that god-awful ""na na na"" chant kicked in. Yikes. And the problem is, most songs here are like that: great potential, no payoff.And other times, the band's just recycling stuff from the Black Album and ""Load."" ""Unforgiven II?"" Pwaahahahahahahahahahahahaaha. I rest my case.This is sad. Break out the black clothing, it's time to begin mourning a band's artistic death."
2,What a dissapointment,"Metallica disappointed me and I believe most of their fans with this album. Their attempt to use their past albums successful name to drive sales just proves that they were not even content with this albums contents. Get the ""Black album"" and Load years before this. How unfortunate they ever released this."
1,Tastes like foot soup,"Sweet Jebus, do yourself a favor and listen to just about anything else: old Metallica, Led Zeppelin, King Crimson, John Coltrane, the Beatles, Wendy Carlos...Load is moderately okay once a year or so, but Reload is magnificent garbage."
4,I don't see what you people find so wrong with this one....,"maybe it's because I haven't listened to any old Metallica. Yes you might say that I'm a new Metallica fan. I just bought this one a month or so ago and the Black Album just very recently. I think they're both great albums. Since this is the ReLoad review section, here's what I think about it: 1) Great rockin' songs, some slower songs, but still well written and sound great. How could anyone not like ""Low Man's Lyric"" or ""Unforgiven II""? Slow music--even by a metal band--doesn't necessarily suck! 2) There was only one sing that I really didn't like--""Bad Seed"". It didn't fit well and the lyrics look like they were written at the last minute. Otherwise...Great CD Oh, and for those of you who say ""this one sucks"" and that's it...try not to be so shallow next time."
2,"Good, at least not their worst.(Load is the worst)","I can not believe they are shameless enough to show us this terrible stuff with the great mark, ""METALLICA"". They can not make masterpiece like Master of Puppets, or Ride The Lightening, anymore???? If they really want to change their style to this pathetic course, they first should change their name. For instance, Populica, Commercialica, or I-Want-Grammy-Againica. Don't cheat your old fan with your name anymore."
4,It rocks. What more can I say.,"I'm the bloke who loves Pink Floyd and Genesis but I still have a soft spot for these boys. I just love the big fat sound of the guitar. 'The Unforgiven II' surpasses it's predecessor, and 'Carpe Diem Baby' is so good you want to rip yourself open and stick the CD into your heart. Not as good as the black album but I feel there is life left in this band."
2,A(nother) Load of Inferior Material,"Well, Metallica and Bob Rock have done it again - the sound of this album is incredible, it's just too bad the songs aren't of equal quality. ""Fuel"" and ""Devil's Dance"" do have the energy and toughness that hearken back to Metallica's glory days when they were a relative unknown, worshipped by an army of unwavering fans who found the band by word of moutch and bootleg tapes of their scorching live performances. Much has changed and so has the music (no small thanks to MTV - the exploiters of all good things musical, and some not so), thankfully Metallica hasn't resorted to the AC/DC-Judas Priest tactic of pumping out the same songs redressed every couple of years. The fact that they have been able to vary their sound and stay successful is a tribute to their talent. However, ReLoad and Load will sit on the shelf gathering dust while I listen to Master of Puppets."
3,It contains Some Brilliant songs but not enough consistency.,"It contains a brilliant song: The Unforgiven II, a soft ballad,as well as heavy songs such as Prince Charming, but doesn't boast as much overall quality as older metallica albums. Recommended for die-hard fans only."
3,What the Hell is happening to Metallica?,"I don't know about you but I am confused as to where Metallica is actually heading. To start off with they were one of the Heaviest bands around. Then they slowy sold out and became more mainstream, and then reached an all time low with Load. Now they release this which seems to be heading back the other way!!! Overall not a bad album some of the better songs are ""Unforgiven II"", ""Devil's dance"" and ""Carpe Diem Baby"". If you want my advice if you are a fan of the early Metallica then do not buy this album you will probably hate it, although I have got used to it. If you are a recent Metallica fan then buy all means feel free to buy this, but don't buy anything earlier than Black. To sum up not a bad album, hopefully thier next ""Proper"" album will be going back towards saome of their better efforts i.e. ""Master Of Puppets"" and ""And Justice For All""."
5,Kicks A$$!,I am a big Metallica fan and have almost all the albums. So I would know a good album compared to others and this one is as good as Master of Puppets or Ride the Lightning. Fuel is one of the fastest Metallica song ever. Prince Charming has a great tune and The Unforgiven 2 even though not as good as the original but still a worthy sequel. I don't see how any fan of Metallica can hate this cd. Sure they changed but they sound just as good as they use to even if the music is a little different.
2,good for what it is-but! I don't like it,"This album is good for what it is but compared to the other Metellica stuff it sucks!Disgusting sound and songs,crap guitar sounds.They try to be up to date but they don't need to,they are Metallica!I tried to like it but can't stand it!Lars Ulrich,I love you and hope you read this!Please lock yourself in your house for a few weeks and listen to your old favorite NWOBHM records.And please grow your hair and produce a real fast HM album for your next realese.If you do this I'm sure heavy metal will make a big come back!Because whatever you do people will buy it anyway-like this horrible album."
1,This album reveals Metallica's future,"Let me tell you what I know about Metallica's future: It looks like the new album would be called B.B.R. (I really don't know what it means). The following specials guests and musics are confirmed: 1) 'Barby Boy', with Acqua doing backing vocals; 2) 'Carma Camaleon', with Boy George; 3) 'I want to break free', with George Michael; 4) 'I love to hate you', with Erasure; 5) 'The Memory Remains II', with Madonna; 6) This one is not confirmed. Yes, man, Metallica and Hansom !!!! But the problem is that the guys of Hanson think that Metallica isn't heavy enough to play with them. Just to end, if you liked 'Load' buy 'Reload', you will love it. Like we say here in Brazil 'Load' and 'Reload' are 'coisa de chabidasso' (expression due to Joao Gordo - Ratos de Porao)."
2,It seems like making money is more important than the music.,This is a shame. I can't believe I'm writing a negative review on a Metallic album but this deserves it. It was a sad day when Cliff Burton died I think Metallica may have died too.
2,Metallica's mainstream metamorphosis continues.,"Metallica's slow and ugly journey into mainstream music, which began with the Black Album, has accumulated with Reload. With the exception of songs like Fuel and The Memory Remains, Reload is a boring, lackluster album. And what's with Unforgiven II? Who makes a sequel to a song??? I respect the band's wishes to evolve and change their musical style, but in the process, they're on the verge of losing fans like me who appreciated them for such raw and speedy metal symphonies as can be found on their first four albums, which mark music at its most awesome and furious. Still, you have to acknowledge their musical talent, which manages to showcase itself on Reload (as it has every one of their albums). My greatest wish is for Metallica's next album to be a return to the speed metal and ultra-heavy guitar crunches that made the mainstream take notice of them in the first place."
1,Worst excuse for a metal album,"This is the worst excuse for a metal album I have ever heard in my life.It is because of this album,and Load that Metallica is no longer my favorite band.If you haven't heard it yet,don't even listen to it because it will make you loose a lot of respect for Metallica."
1,1 star cause i can't give any lower,"Well, the lead single from this album says it all THE MEORY REMAINS"
1,Get a Load of MY LOAD!,"This album seems to be the product of Metallica's on-goign battle with mid-life crisis. LOADED with colorful pictures of the band, and empty of good music, it is a display of what happens when a excellent, down to earth, garage band starts hanging out at the MTV beach house and forgets about what got them there in the first place: GOOD MUSIC! Although it is slightly more palpable than their previous album LOAD, it still a LOAD of sonic lameness."
1,If I could give them less than one star.....,"All I can say is disappointment. The only good thing I will give them is that the unforgiven II is alot better than the original. What ever happened to ""Metallica""? At least they could change the name as they've changed the music. That way the ""Memory still Reamains"" of the Metallica some of us don't even miss anymore. Long live real metal bands!!"
1,STOP THE MADNESS!!,"The problem with all those""fans"" who like this new junk is that they probably didn't start out listening to the real metallica. This album demonstrates what happens to a band that needs to make more money. The lyrics are week, the music is bubble gum, and the reals fans are disgusted."
1,Make it stop!!!!,"A complete RE-LOAD of (...). Obviously too concerned with MTV, awards, and mainstream America. Too slow, too weak, too calm. Reload is simply horrible. Who where their musical influences for this album anyway? The ""New Kids on the Block?"" Cliff Burton must be rolling over in his grave.I give this cd a NEGATIVE 10."
1,It doesn't get much worse than this.,"Puberty has not yet fallen upon the members of this group. A mix of senseless lyrics and boring, low-quality music is hardly worth the dollars nor the time."
1,TREACHERY !,"That's what you can call this record by Metallica, the one-time ""kings of Trash"". Now, they did this horrible sequence to ""Load"". I hope they find new fans to their collection, because I quit!"
1,If even deserving 1 star,"What happend to the greatest band of the eighties and early ninties, It's like they don't exist any more. The new albums, any thing after the black album, bites. They lost their edge and are falling into a deep hole that almost no one recovers, I think that they should go back to their old style of music or leave the industry all togeather and try to maintain their dignity"
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible!","This CD stinks - big time! I can't believe anyone can like it. These ""fans"" must be delusional. Anybody who criticises other reviewers for knocking on this CD because they think we don't like change has not really listened to this CD on its own merits. IT STINKS! And it's not because Metallica ""changed"" - after all the Black album was a radical change and most people (including me) LOVED that CD - it's simply because this particular CD is horrible (along with Load). I'm sorry, but that is just a fact. Listen to it again."
1,What went wrong?,Metallica was really a great band. I used to be able to listen to Metallica and enjoy it. Metallica needs to write new stuff. Load and Reload were written at the same time so hopefully some refreshing stuff will come along. I know Metallica has only done music for themselves but if they want fans they should get back to their old stuff. I am sure glad Rob Zombie didn't do this.
1,"Better luck next time, boys.","Adding a review to a collection of 131 would appear to be a futile waste of time, but the album struck such a nerve in me that I couldn't resist. Having been a fan since the Kill 'Em All days, and being one who daily laments the lack of truly inventive, heavy bands on the scene today, I find ReLoad a simple waste of money. I have no problem with a band changing as they grow older, mature, and broaden their horizons. What I do have a problem with is Metallica used to be so uncompromising. They wrote and played with a fury and passion that quite literally shaped a new generation of metal. To hear them now is to hear just another hard rock band floundering through radio-ready pablum. More power to them if they reach a new generation of fans, but the Metallica of today finds itself awash in a sea of Filter, Alice in Chains, and Tool with little to distinguish it. The Metallica of yesterday wouldn't have stood for such mediocrity."
4,Another Review,"When I first bought this CD I nearly cried. I wrote into Amazon and gave it a mere two stars. Then I started to like it and wrote in again giving it 3 stars. Now I'm writing in again and giving it four stars because I like it so much. It grows on you. I will agree that it isn't really hard-core metal, but niether is it alternative. Ignor the two other reviews I gave it, this album rocks. I can't wait to get Master Of Puppets though, as speed metal is what I really like and Re-Load isn't speed metal (with the exception of Fuel)."
3,Should Have Been Called Load Lite,"This cd is basically a watered down Load. Most of the cd is filler and there is only like three decent songs on the whole cd. My favorites are The Unforgiven 2, Where the Wild Things Are, and Low Man's Lyric. Fuel and The Memory Remains are among the worst songs of Metallica's hit singles.In Metallica's whole studio album catalog this ranks near the bottom, probably seventh out of the eight they released. Only St. Anger is worse than this overall. At least this does have a few decent songs."
1,Metallica of the 80's hates this album!,"But something happended to the members of Metallica because it's no rational to make albums such as Master Of Puppets and then Reload and Load... since the black album Metallica started to make bad music, too bad because they used to make wonders."
1,"Oh, THIS was a brilliant move!","Let's release the cr*ppy reject songs from an album that tanked!Way to go, guys!"
3,Cry Us A River,"This album is not terrific, as it has some filler. That filler is, generally, very bad. But when its good, this album succeeds. For some reason, the thrashing burn-outs never matured, however, and they are here giving undeserved 1-star ratings. It's all very unfortunate.This album is a good, solid, hard, blues-based, rocker. It is interesting enough to keep you listening. The first half of this album is very good.If you like hard rock, check it out."
4,"Fo Reel, Fo Reel",This joint is hot son. I can't even hate. These kids got flow and sound original which is hard to do these days. I give them props for that.
4,Earthworms,This little book provided a lot of information on earthworms and their benefits to the soil. It's a quick read that every gardener might enjoy.
4,Superb scholarship and a little fluff,"I. Howard Marshall's commentary on the Epistles of John has much to commend it to the pastor, Bible teacher, or scholar. His treatment of the passages is thorough, and his text critical footnotes are helpful. The only problem with the commentary is the bit of fluff that it contains. Marshall tends to interject his scholarship with things like old hymn lyrics, which the reader may not find helpful, yet this book is highly recommended based on both scholarship and readability."
3,"Slow Going, But Good","As in the first two books of the series, this one limps along at a less than rapid pace, despite being rife with godly possession, swapped body parts, mechanical soldiers, and one priestly space vampire. It was in this book I began to notice Wolfe's need to have his characters talk and talk about what they know (or think they know) and how they came to know it, as well as his tendency to skip important events only to have his characters talk about them later. This is all fine and good, and is all part of that unique Wolfe atmosphere, which is one part 'huh?' and two parts 'WTF?!' I still believe the encompassing story of the Whorl, the ""gods"" who created it, and where it's going are the hooks in this series. But given its size (over 1400 pages), at each long-winded conversation I couldn't shake the feeling that Wolfe's characters were being paid by the word."
4,Probably the best book of the four in the series,"The action really picks up in this one. Ultimately, the series is disappointing, though. See my review of the fourth book."
4,"Unfortunately, a good movie.","I am very anti-abortion yet I feel the need to give credit to Ms. Weill. This is a great movie, taking away personal opinions of the issues in question."
4,Do you have a picky eater,This is a good kids movie because it helps them see why it is good to take naps and eat right. It also gives the parent some different ideas on helping. The charcters on the film are clowns which kids really relate too.
4,The gift recipient loves this key chain!,Here are some comments directly from him:Real carbon fiber and nice colors on the //M emblem..and it stands out in a set of keys...I love the keychain since it turns out to be the exact emblem off my car...it goes well.
2,Better Books out there,"The problem I have with this book, as well as a lot of other Rifkin's books, it's not the message that is being conveyed, it's how it's being conveyed. Rifkin's research style is a mile wide and an inch deep. I pined to have some of the chapters be at least a couple pages longer so there was more substance. He makes wide, sweeping generalizations with the minimum of hard data to back it up.That, in addition to this book now being well over a decade old, makes me very reluctant to recommend. There are better, newer books that have the same point of view that are better written. And this is coming from a reviewer who has not eaten beef since 1997."
5,Great Reasons to Say No to Beef!,"This book was a great influence on me being a vegetarian. It helped me to look at beef in another way, and also to make me aware of the harm involved in cattle grazing. This book is educational, and also an eye-opener. Read it 10 times, and let your friends read it too!"
5,Just great,"I'm usually not a big fan of the osborne series, but once in a while, they get it right. This book is indeed complete. The only reference you will need."
4,A Great Starter CD for Vai Fans,"I'm a big Steve Vai fan, and this CD is a good place for fans who want to get a small taste of what Steve is like. It doesn't offer up the cream of his works, for that you have to span his whole catalog. But still this is a great place to startI recommend this as a start then branch of to his full albums and even the live stuff, like the DVD Live at the Astoria London and even the G3 DVD's."
1,No illustrations?,"The contents page lists quite a few illustrations, however, none appeared in my download. Not sure if that was a problem in the download or how the book was set up, but as they say - ""a picture is worth a thousand words""; and I don't have any. A bit pointless really."
2,Not as good as thermacare,"Pads are very small and they do not heat up as hot as thermacare, and the heat barely lasts 4 hours."
4,More info on the site would be nice,"First let me say that the CD was recieved in good shape, and in good time. But if you're a serious brand X fan all this stuff is available on previous releases. I understand it's hard to find new music from an old band but the interest in unreleased stuff led me to buy this CD. If you're looking for a first brandX CD this would be a nice choice."
2,Not Cuisinart's Best,"I purchased this set thinking that Cuisinart had improved the quality since there were so many reviews on the cracked handles...of course they hadn't. 13 of my knives were cracked, that's over half the set! I called Cuisinart and they directed me to another company that handles their cutlery (phone number for those with the same problem is 1-800-252-3390). After waiting on hold and being bounced around for an hour, I finally spoke to a representative that told me that the set was discontinued and offered me either the KitchenAid red set or a black or stainless steel Cuisinart set. The actual blades and weight on this set are great, but I would pass on this product and just purchase another brand or the stainless steel set and save yourself a lot of time on the phone."
5,3 x 3,"I've seen almost the enitre series and am happy to say its excellent! Why haven't I seen all the episodes you ask? Well the company that previously released the series stopped one tape shy of finishing it. The animation, plot and characters are like a breath of fresh air. You'll see! I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do!"
5,BRAVO!!!,"Even if you're not yet a fan of Shirley Bassey, you will be after listening to this collection. She has a voice to die for!! These songs are all classics. I love to sing along and pretend like I have a great voice too."
2,bassey,"This is the first time I have hear of Bassey, I bought it for the songs but I didn't care for her voice"
5,Positive ideas to take us forward.,"As modern day culture teeters on the brink of collapse, Theobald offers an analysis of the situation and some positive things that people can do.One of his central ideas is that ordinary people can make a difference, if only they have the will to take action and the belief that they can change things.He advocates new ways of thinking about our problems and the future, and working in a co-operative manner is stressed.He has many ideas that are worth serious consideration if we want to avoid catastrophe."
4,Thought Provoking!,"I was an economics major in college and a practicing republican. Reworking Success challenged my previous learnings and opened my eyes to a world I didn't know existed. Theobald doesn't push his views, he brings you along for a ride that you didn't even know you got on. Recommend highly! Julie in Seattle, Washington"
4,Problem with a equaton.,"I have problem to use the solution of the problem 'Two-Layer Slab with contanst resistance at the interface', pages 282-287. I get always false output."
5,We Wore Out This Book...,"Considering my wife and I only spent 4 days visiting the coast of Maine we used this book so much that I would need to replace it if we made another trip. The maps and the directions were excellent. In addition to information on times of day to get the best photographs, tides, etc., there were tips on dining and side attractions. We highlighted, underlined and turned down page corners to the extent that the guide got pretty ragged. Pictures in the guide were excellent and intriguing. For anyone seriously interested in photography in Maine, this is a must-have guide book."
3,Wish there was more detail...,"maps and trail guides would be very useful..., but otherwise, well put together. Good production values and some excellent photos."
2,A good book but not quite there...,"I thought is was a good book no dought, but it didn't have that ""kick"" that really good books have. It was ok but not Newberry material.The book is about a 13/14 year old boy who got cought stealling some shoes that he didn't really steal. He was punished by going into a camp. In this forsacen camp they had to dig all day long. Yes sadly enough they had do dig holes (hints the name of the book). These holes had to be five feet deep and five feet wide. It sounds like torture to me but not to the boy. He suspects that the sycotic warden is looking for something. But what could it possibly be???You have to read the book to find out."
2,Good book for young readers,"I am a 15 year old girl, and we read Holes in my English class. I thought the book was pretty good. It really let your mind go nuts, because of how you would be reading about one person in one paragraph and then the next paragraph would be about someone else. I also feel that the leaders at camp Green Lake were to harsh on the kids by making them dig all those holes and sometimes not feeding them. It was just plain nasty. I would recommend this book to really only kids up to 6th grade."
2,What were the Newbery judges thinking?,"Well, I, an adult reader, picked it up since it won the Newbery, and I can't imagine why. It's far too contrived and unbelievable to be taken as worthy. Honestly, the last name of Yelnats just to make a palindrome. And coincidence is packed on top of coincidence, descendant after descendant showing up in the story, it's just far too much for an adult to stomach. *Burp!*"
5,This book was fantastic!,"This book was great. Stanley Yelnats is a boy who is wrongfully accused of doing something HE DIDN'T DO! He is sent to boot camp instead of jail, and he has to dig a 5 ft. deep and wide hole EVERY SINGLE day! This story has a couple of twists and I enjoyed it very much, and I think you will too."
5,Great Book and a Great Present.,This is a great classic that is challenging enough for my Niece that she will be able to learn from this book and still get more out of it later on. Shes a reader and I know she will enjoy this very much.
4,the best book ever!!!,I choose to give this book a four star rating because it is really interesting and I was on the edge of my seat the hole time (get it hole) I would say that anyone that likes awesome books this is for them
5,A breath taking story that will knock your socks off.,I recommend it to people from around 11+. It was so excellent that I want to read it again. It is the best book I have ever read and it would probably be one of the best books I will ever read. I thought it was great how the story was linked together with Stanley's Great Great Great Grandfather's time and the present.
4,Holes,"Holes was an awsome book and I enjoyed reading it a lot. After I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. The suspense and excitement level is way beyond a lot of other books I gave read. 'Caveman' is a good friend to other people in the book and I would probably like to have him as a friend in real life. I like the way the author switches between different stories in the middle of the book. It creates a lot of suspense. I really enjoy reading books by this author. Holes is a really good book."
3,Holes Audio,The CDs do not stop at the end of certain chapters so you have to scroll to find your spot. The titles are in a foreign lanuguage.
5,A Pleasure to Read,"If it weren't for Stanley Yelnats's ""no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather,"" he never would have gotten into this mess. Now, he's stuck at Camp Green Lake, a juvenile detention center where nothing is green--nor is there a lake--for a crime he didn't do. The warden's philosophy for turning ""bad boys"" good is to have them dig a hole each day. But is that really the only reason she has them digging in the middle of the desert where one of the country's most infamous outlaws died a century before? What's really going on at Camp Green Lake?Louis Sachar's novel, ""Holes"" (Yearling, 2000), is filled with a dry sarcasm that keeps readers laughing as they read this bizarre, yet grounded tale. Stanley and the boys of Group D are a delight to read with all of their oddities and nicknames. Sachar masterfully weaves together multiple storylines to create this touching masterpiece, which won the Newberry in 1999."
1,dig into a horrible book,"it's about a boy who is unlucky he digs , he eats , and he sleeps all day but when his friend gets lost it gets even more boring it's ok if you like slow book's but that's my thought you might like it hey I might even like in 3 years"
1,Holes,"I did not like this book,Holes. There were not enough chapters and the chapters were too short. The plot was too easy to figure out. It was a total downer. I normally never put a book down but I did not want to go to it. The end with the advertisement for the sploosh, in my opinion, was the worst part of the book. I don't get why someone would get the name Caveman? And they go back and forth beteween plots. They go between the plot with Sam ""The Onion Man"" and Kate Barlow and back to the plot with Stanley and Zero and the rest of the people."
5,Couldn't put it down!!!!!!!!!!!! :0,"This was the first book in a long time that I couldn't put down. I don't read that much and this book kept me wanting to read it. The author, Louis Sachar, wrote like he was at the camp with the boys. He wrote so that you could feel the thirstyness, tiredness, and soreness of the boys when they finished digging the holes. When the boys were hot, thirsty, and tired; so where you. You could feel what he was writing. Near the end of the book you didn't want to put it down because you wanted to know if Zero and Caveman were going to live. The ending was shocking and wonderful. It had a perfect ending to go with a perfect book. I loved how the book told about the history of the lake and tied it into Caveman's life. This was a wonderful book. It was the first book in a very long time that didn't put me to sleep at night. I would tell kids my age to read this book. Mousey in Mr. Murry's A2 English 10 H."
4,Best selling book at our book fair inFlower Mound Texas,My daughter and I fought over this book--I had to get up at 3:30 am to read it because she kept taking it to school with her!
5,"Holes, a great book","In a book called Holes, Stanley Yelnats is sent to Camp Green Lake Texas, a camp where bad boys have to dig a hole five feet deep and five feet in every direction, and your shovel is what you measure with. The good part is, it's only one hole a day. Or is it?Holes is a book I didn't want to put down. Read holes by Louis Sacher."
5,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!,"This book I would have to say is one of the best books I have ever read. The story is about an unlucky boy named Stanley Yelnats ( notice his last name is his first name backwards). His family has been cursed for years. Stanley is sent to a boys detentional center because he was framed stealing Clyde Livingston's shoes ( although they fell on his head from the sky). Now a review from me can't explain at all how good this book is so if you have any questions, read the book."
4,Holes,This book was very detailed and it had a very good plot and storyline. It followed the reader closly and it made several connections between Stanley's life andother stories told within the book. Even though the book included several stories of Stanley's relatives and Kate barlow they all connected and it made sense. However the auther left off apruptly and he left the reader with unanwsered questions. A follow up storey is advised.
5,"Strange, But very good","Holes is a really good book, but takes a long time to get in to. It has a very strange storyline but is a great read and very rewarding"
4,Pretty Good,I read this book in 5th grade and I believe that it is a good book.(I'm going into 6th)The Part that discourages you from reading it is the begining because it starts out pretty slow. After you get past the first part the book is a very fun adventurous book that will suprise you in the end. I recomend this book to you because I think it is a good book to read.
4,Why should kids have all the enjoyment?,"This book was recommended to me by a librarian. I like everything about the book - characterization, multiple plot lines that come together, imagery, and lessons about a wide variety of subjects. It also assumes intelligence in the reader, and that the reader will keep things in mind. A satisfying ending completes the many pleasures of this book."
4,Holes,"Have you ever been forced to dig a 5-foot deep and wide hole, in a desert that's 110 degrees, eyery day. In the book Holes by Louis Sachar, Stanly Yelnats has to. In the bigging Stanly was framed for a crime he didn,t commit. The judge told him he could go to jail or Camp Green Lake. Stanley's family was poor so he told the judge he would go to the camp. When he got there the camp was a dried out desert that wasn't even a lake. Later at the camp he meets Mr. Sir; a camp counselor,Armpit, X-Ray, Magnet, Zero, Zig Zag; and Mr. Pendensky; their counselor. As the time goes by Stanly and Zero become friends. The days get harder and harder, until finally Zero and him run away. I envite you to read the book Holes by Louis Sachar."
5,Better than Harry Potter 1 and 2,This book is the best! I definetly reccomend to 3rd grade and up. It is about a boy who was charged guilty of a crime and has a choice between jail and Camp Green lake. He chose the camp but he chose wrong. They have to dig HUGE holes in the hot sun and only get a little water. It is a very descriptive and well written book. I read it a day because it is very hanging. This book I like I said is in my oppionon better than Harry Potter 1 and 2. If you liked Harry Potter you will love this! Read it! The bad part about the book is that I think this book has some sad parts but a book that can change your emotion must be well written. I love this book!
4,A Good Book,I read this book.It was a pretty good book.Almost everyone has read this book. It you haven't read it you probably seen the movie. There are somethings different from the movie and the book. There are lots of suprises in this book. You have to stay with the book because it has a few different stories in it.One is in the present and in the western day. I recomend this boook if you like supriese and flashbacks.
5,Lavonia's review,I like the book because Stanley's family was cursed because of his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather.He also met some new friends.
4,Stephanie's review-This is a great book!!,I though the book was great because it had an Interesting story.SO READ IT!!!!
4,holes is a cool book,It is about a kid named stanley and he is at a camp amd has to dig holes.He has a nick name and it is cave man.
5,a great book for kids,"This is one of the best childrens/young adult books I've read in awhile. It is an Indian Paitnt Brush book for 2000 and deserves the title, along of course with the Newbery Medal. I had the good fortune to meet and listen to Mr. Sachar and he is just as wry and interesting in real life. This story has a nice message, and keeps the reader interested, very worthwhile."
5,"Fun times, sad times","Holes is an emotional book that makes you think about life and justice in life. I thoroughly enjoyed it from page 1. I couldn't stop reading it! I skipped supper, reading Mr. Sachar's flowing words and throbbing dialect. A must for kids (and of course adults!) ages 9 and up. It's a book that everyone will love, laugh and cry with. I VERY STRONGLY reccomend it!"
5,"Riveting, can't put it down, book.","I am actually 29 but have been reading all things fiction since I learned the alphabet. You don't have to be a kid to enjoy this, it is a riveting, fascinating and quick read for adults as well. This is an excellent book about a boy who goes to a sort of juvenile detention center that the owners try to pass off as a ""camp"" where kids are forced to dig a hole five feet deep and five feet wide every single day early in the morning before the sun rises. He finds out that digging holes isn't just to build character, as the owner's seem to suggest, but there just may be a deeper meaning in those holes and a reason that the great great great grandson of the no good, good for nothing dirty rotten pig stealing ancestor should be there. If you like a story that surprises you and your kids, you'll love this one. I have read it to my nephews with rave reviews."
5,Trash or treasure? Pass the shovel,"Does digging a really large hole under the burning Texas sun turn a bad boy into a good boy? That's one of the questions this book tries to answer. In this unique story, a boy with a name that's a palindrome gets arrested for a crime he didn't commit. He finds a buried treaaure and breaks an old family curse because of his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather. Don't miss this book!"
5,Holes,In Holes a boy named Stanley Yelnats gets hit in the head with a famous baseball player's shoes. He finds himself at Camp Green Lake. He meets the other campers. Every day each boy has to dig a hole five feet deep and five feet wide. Everyone tells him their digging for character but Stanley thinks their digging for something else.Holes is great!
5,Iman's Review,"Oh my gosh, what a great book. This is the second best book I have ever read. This is about a teenager named Stanley Yelnats who gets sent to a Juvenile Detention camp for commiting a crime that he really did not do. So, now he has to dig a 5X5 foot hole every day, wake up at 4 in the morning, eat the worst food on the planet, and have to deal with the horrendous staff. He believes that he got sent here because of a curse that a psychic woman named Madam Zeroni put on his great-great granfather. At the end, the camp gets seized, the workers get arrested, and Stanley finds treasure!!! In the end, the Yelnats become millionaires and live happily ever after."
3,An interesting adventure novel...,"Stanley Yelnats IV carries on the family curse, when he gets send to Camp Green Lake, a detention camp, for a ""crime"" he didn't commit. When Stanley arrives, he quickly realizes that the camp is not what he pictured. No lake, no shade, just lots of holes...Stanley joins a group of delinquent boys, who all wake up early to dig a hole a day in the dried-up lake bed where the camp is located. The story goes back and forth between Stanley IV and his ancestors, where we learn about the curse on his family. It's interesting moving back and forth in time and trying to figure out the exact mystery of why the boys are digging all the holes. A nice fast-moving read where everything is wrapped up in the end."
4,A well written book,"Having seen ""Holes"", by Louis Sachar in many classrooms, I was drawn to read it. I am glad I did.Holes is the story of Stanley Yelnats who seems to have inherited some rather bad luck. It is a story of self discovery with a little family history thrown in.As much as the story, however, I enjoyed the craft of the book. Mr. Sachar has written a 'textbook' book, with foreshadowing, irony and enough twists and turns to make you forget you are reading this 'for school'. He gives a lot to discuss as well as a lot to savor!I was as pleased with the way this book was written as I was with the story itself. Read it for fun if you don't have to read it 'for school'!PS. If you like this one, try ""A Separate Peace"" by John Knowles, another book I had to read 'for school' that I just loved!"
4,Holes,I liked this book a whole lot. It was very interesting the way the author made the plot. It was interesting how all of the juvenile kids let each other fit in. They were not actually the mean people most everybody makes them out to be. They were nice to every kid and did not discriminate each other. It was my favorite part when Stanley and the other kid ran away aand they lived off of wild onions they found at God's thumb. I liked this book very much and thought it was exellent book to have read.
5,Kids Classic,"This is a book that most kids thinks is better than Harry Potter. The hero Stanley is a loser living with a loser family when he is mistakenly accused and found guilty of a serious theft. Instead of going to a juvenile detention centre he goes to a civilian run program where he has to dig holes in the hot Texas sun.The book has two broad layers. The reason for Stanley's predicament results from a historic curse his family has been subject to. The reasons for this are explained in a back narrative. Against this is the story of Stanley coping with his environment, learning how to live in a crazy system and making friends.The message of the book is reasonably good. The world is not necessarily a sensible place but one has to keep working at things. Bizarrely enough the reform camp is not that far of the mark of some that have existed.The book is easy to read and adult readers can read it in a couple of hours. Kids might take a bit longer but they would love it."
4,A good book,I thought Holes was a very good book. It was interesting and it proved that fate does happen. It has a lot of suspence and it makes it fun to read.
4,Holes,"I liked the book Holes. It was very interesting and fun to read. I like suspence stories and this was one. I would recommend this bool for other people. There are many things at the end of the book that I would like to know, but it doesn't tell anything. Holes is a story about friendship and how people can do things they never thought they could."
5,Sachar Rises to a new level,"As a retired media specialist I've always enjoyed reading Sachar to my students. I was pleasantly surprised to see he won the Newbery. I've always thought the Newbery committee to be slanted towards heavier books. This is not the typical Sachar, but he has reached a more complex level without losing the appeal to many student readers. There's much to think about here. To me it ranks with some of the best Newbery Selections. Somewhere with Maniac Magee and The Giver."
3,Book Review,This story is about kids (boys) that got in trouble that have to dig holes to find treasures. The auther is Louis Sacher.HolesZero takes shoes and the cops come for him so he throws the shoes off the bridge and stanly picks them up and he and zero go to camp green lake where boys go when they get in trouble.I think the book is good. I think any body should read it. Some people might compare them self to it.
5,A Review of Holes,"Holes is a wonderful book. The characters are funny, mean, sad. Louis Sachar is a great author.If you read Holes, you might not put it down. It really is a great book to read."
4,Transmitter from B-1. Hi LQK! H les Review,"This was definately a great book. I rate it 4 stars. A great children's book that could take one off to many new levels. Some of the characters will stay in our hearts forever! Even the no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealin-great-great-grandfather. Mr.Pendancekey, watch out for snake venom nails!Say goodbye to God's Thumb for us! GOODBYE CAMP GREEN LAKE! ZERO AND CAVEMAN FOREVER!"
4,MV's Look at Holes,"I thought Holes was a very good book and I guarantee any reader would like to read the book.Although at times it can get very confusing, in the end it all straightens out and is extrodinary how all the charecters in the book are connected.The reason why I rated this book four stars is because in the beginning it started off dull and boring,but later on in the story it gets very interesting and wierd at the same time!The one thing I really didn't like was that there were three stories to the book and somtimes it gets a little to confusing and you just want to quit.Other than that I recommend this book to any reader 4th and above.It was a good book!"
5,Holes,"Stanley Yelnats is sent to Camp Green Lake because he is accused of something which he didn't do. He is sent to Camp Green Lake to dig holes to dig character but later in the book he finds out different. He meets many people at Camp Green Lake. Some of these people are Zero, X-Man, Armpit, Magnet and many more people. Why is Stanley really at Camp Green Lake? Read the book and you will find it out yourself."
4,MY HOLES REVIEW!,"When the class started reading holes, Louis said that stanley had to go to Camp Green Lake for the summer, and I thought that was good because a lot can happen at a camp. One strong point that encouraged me to read more was that Louis kept going into different characters lives, and i wanted to know the outcome. But one weak point was with Mary Lou in the bathing suit. One other strong point was most of the characters went to camp with some problems, but went home with better lives. See if Sachar can fill in your holes!"
4,"Holes, a story within a story within a story","I think Holes was a very well written book. I didn't like how Sachar jumped between the 3 worlds. I also didn't like the names of some of the boys, like Barf Bag for example. I also didn't like how he left me hanging at the end. I liked the climb up the mountain. I think that was exciting. Overall, the book was'nt bad. I actually liked it."
5,Holes,"Stanley Yelnats is under a curse. Now he is sent to the boy's detention center, Camp Green Lake,except there is no lake or anything that is green. The boys there spent the days digging holes. Soon Stanley finds out that they are looking for something. Also he makes a friend, Zero. Together they go and solve the mystrey, and finds a chest with a secret.I enjoyed reading the end of this book over and over. There is something mysterous. We find out that Zero's great grandmother was Stanley's great grandpa's friend. It also turns out that Zero finds his mother. The ending was satisfying, with the mysterous beginning.I really like this book because it builds up the want to read more. Mr. Louis Sachar is very talented in building up suspence. Even though this book has a dark humor in this book."
4,Holes doesn't have many holes,"I think this book is very interesting. When I first started to read the book I wasn't too interested becuase the book didn't look like a book that I would read. Yet, as I started to read the rest of it, I really liked it. I couldn't put the book down until I had finished the entire book. I liked this book because it was easy to follow the entire time. Also, the bad guys in the book got what they deserved in the end. The people that made you angry becuase they were mean to the main character ended up getting bad things happen to them. When they did get what they deserved it made you happy. This book is easy for a teenaged person to read because it's easy to relate and things about each character make it either easy to love the person, or they make you want to hate the character. I like that in a book, where you can see a person as one of the people you hang out with."
5,A well written jigsaw puzzle.,"Holes, by Louis Sachar, is a very weird and interesting novel. The novel is written like a jigsaw puzzle. It is like a jigsaw puzzle because all the stories fit together.The story begins by talking about the main character, Stanley. Later a story is told about his great-great-grandfather and how he was supposed to have carried a woman up a hill but he didn't. The woman cursed because he forgot. Later on in the story Stanley meets a kid named, Hester Zeroni, mean while the reader knows that the woman, his great-great-grandfather was suppose to carry up the hill, is Madame Zeroni. These two facts fit together like puzzle pieces because these two people are related. I also liked it because it is written in first person. First person helped to show Stanley's true emotions. This also helps him to talk about his experiences first hand. Overall this book was excellent."
4,the best book,"The book I read was Holes. It was one of my favorite books. It was about a young overweight boy who is cursed. His name is Stanley Yelnats and he gets accused of stealing a pair of shoes from a museum. He gets sent to a camp for juvenile kids. In the camp there are different groups, Stanley gets sent to group D where all of the boys give each other nicknames. The punishment was they had to dig holes 5 feet wide 5 feet deep everyday, the warden says they dig holes to build character but Stanley thinks she is trying to find something very important. I recommend this book because unlike some books that are boring in the beginning and start getting good at the end this book is always exciting from the first page."
5,terrific,"holes is the story of a boy names stanley who is convicted of stealing a pair of sneakers.he must choose to stay at prison or a place called camp green lake.stanley chooses the camp and is forced to dig holes six feet wide and six feet deep,one a day.soon a boy at the camp named zero runs away ans stanley wonders in the desert to find him.together,the two boy go on a journey you won't forget."
4,Mmm... It's O.k,This book is not the best book that I've read but it's woth your time StanleyNeeds to dig holes because they accused him of stilling shoes? Yes shoes that's another thing I don't like why shoes?...
4,Keepin it Real,I thought that the book was pretty good. I thought that it was easy to read and easy to pay attension to. I liked how there was always a part that something had to happen. It wasn't like any other book that had a good beginning a boring middle and a good ending. It was just good staight through. I personally liked the part where Zero nailed the guy in the head with a shovel. ...
4,This was a very good book and all ages will love it.,I think this was a very good book how Stanley Yelnats had bad luck from his great great pig stealing grndfather. just because he stole a pig. And how Zero's great great grandmother was maddam Zeroni. I think this was a very good book. And thanks for signing my book Louis Sachar in Kent Ohio.
4,Read this book,"The book I am reading is Holes by Louis Sachar. I gave this book four stars because it was funny and well written. My favorite characters are Stanley and Zero. I like them because they are the main characters. My favorite part is when Zero and Stanley climb the mountain called ""Gods Thumb."" Holes is one of my favorite books."
4,Holes,"The book I'm writing about is Holes, by Louis Sachar. This book is about a person name Stanley, he is an innocent kid who gets dent to Camp Green Lake because the police accused him of stealing shoes. You might be thinking to your selves, ""Oh, big deal! A pair of shoes? I've done worse! "" But these aren't any ordinary shoes, these are Clyde Livingston's shoes. Clyde Livingston is a famous baseball player. Well, anyways, in Camp Green Lake, you have to dig holes all day. They think it will build character. Actually, they are trying to find something, but what? Read this book to find out."
5,This is Louis Sachar's most amazing book!,"This book was filled with wonderful characters like Stanley Yelnats and Hector Zeroni, and it had an incredible plot with wonderful surprises, twists, and turns from the first page to the last page."
4,"The great book ""Holes""","I think it is one of the best books I have read. Stanley is a kid which does not fight even when people making fun of him. He does not resort to violence. He taught me to not fight even though other people make me mad. I think that reading this book could help lots of kids. I think kids my age can read this book with a little bit of problems. It won the Newbery Award, which means it's a really good book."
5,Not my Type= 4 1/2 stars,"The pretty Newburry medal on the front cover signifies that this book is the best book published that year. It propably is. Here is the synopsis:A boy is charged with steeling a charitable shoe from a showcase. He is prosecuted and found guilty. He is sentenced to spend time in a boot camp-like atmosphere, where the next day has nothing to offer. The reason this is is because all inmates must dig a hole 5 feet in diameter and depth. The Mr. Sir is very intolerant with the inmates (who are by the way all children). Why do they have to dig holes though in such a arid, desert-like place. Read to find out.I give this story 4 and 1/2 stars. The reason probably is because it isn't my kind of story. Sure a story about holes sounds really stupid, like I thought, but I found it almost outstanding. If you like fiction, then you'll love it way more than I do, and I like it very much. Don't pass this one up. ;)"
3,The Mysterious Hole,I THINK HOLES WAS A PRETTY GOOD BOOK BUT IT GETS KIND OF CONFUSING LIKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOOK.I LIKED ALOT OF THE PARTS BECAUSE THEY WERE MASTERIOUS AND INTERESTING. ONE OF THE PARTS I LIKED WAS WHEN THE YELLOW SPOTTED LIZARD DOES SOMETHING BUT I CANT SAY.SOME OF THE PARTS I DIDNT LIKE BECAUSE THEY DIDNT MAKE ANY SENCE AND THEY MADE ME CONFUSED.
5,it is a great book,HOLES IS A VERY GOOD BOOK. THE BOOK IS SOMETIMES CONFUSING BECAUSE IT IS A STORY WITHIN A STORY WITHIN A STORY.IT WAS SUCH A GOOD BOOK YOU CANT PUT IT DOWN.IT IS A GOOD PRESENT FOR CHISTMAS.LOUIS SACHAR MADE THE BEST BOOK I EVER READ.I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD MOVIE.AS MY LAST WORDS GET THE BOOK BEFOR IT SELL OUT.THE BOOK WILL CHEER YOU UPBY NO COMMECT
4,To stay alive or not to stay alive?,"This book was great! It has many mysteries in it and it all connected from one link to another. When I started the book it was really hard to put it down. You keep on wondering what was going to happen next. This was mainly about a boy named Stanley with a a curse and a camp called Camp Green Lake where there is no lake but a desert with deadly animals. Stanley is digging holes in the camp but the Warden is looking for something. Now its all about Stanley getting out of there and getting that something the Warden is looking for. Except,he has to get out... alive."
3,preview,Holes is the best book I have ever read. Stanley gets blamed for robbing Clyde Livingstone's shoes. He got sent to Camp Green Lake where he makes friends and finds treasure that his grandfather was robbed by Kissing Kate. Stanley's family is cursed by a lady which Stanley's great-great grandfather forgot to take her up the mountain. If you want to know what happens read Holes.
5,This book was awesome.,Right know I am going to tell you if I liked the book or not. Holes was a great book butI want to see the movie too.It might be better than the bookbut the book taught me a lesson.I loved the book and Ihope you like it too.
5,a 'holey' enjoyable book,"I first came across Sachar's work at University and have loved it ever since.Holes is truly an amazingly well written story which touches on acceptability, non-conformity, friendship, buried treasure, crime and lots of onions!The book is amazingly funny and bittersweet, sometimes both at once. Although the narrative of Stanley's experience at camp and his family history may seem unconnected, they are combined in a narrative technique which is nothing short of genius!The novel sees Stanley escape his family destiny, discover who he truly is and find friendship and courage for the first time.This is a truly satisfying and beautiful read for anyone who has ever gotten into trouble, felt marginalised or had a life full of bad luck.Read it - and you will never look at holes the same again!!"
3,Dig a Little Further,"Because it lacks action, the book Holes, by Louis Sachar is mediocre. The plot is very well hidden, but is hard to understand.For example the flashbacks lead to confusion of the plot. The story seemed like a run-on sentence. It went on and on and on. To understand some of the text. The reader needs to read it more than once. The beginning starts off slow and the end finished too quickly. Louis Sachar seems to get tired of writing this book. On the good side it is suspenceful. It is one of those books where it depends on the person who reads it."
3,okay,"I think this book is okay.It jumps back and forth to a bunch of different people.The plot is good,but everything else is a little meaningless.That is why I rated it 3 stars."
4,HOLES,"The story started when zero stole a pair of shoes, but the cops thought that stanley stole the shoes.The judge told stanley he could go to jail or go to camp green lake.Stanley though it would be easy at camp green lake but he was wrong. Stanley got on the bus to camp green lake.After he got there he was introduced to Mr.Sir one of the camps consellers.Then he got intoduced to Mr.Pandanski and the kids at group D.The kids nicknames were Magnet,Zero,Squid,and X -Ray.They gave Stanley a nickname of Cave Man.HE was digging his hole one day when he found a gold tube with KB on it.Stanley gave it to X-Ray and he said that he would get the day off.Then a few days later Stanley became good friends with Zero."
3,THE BOOK HOLES......MY REVIEW.....,"This is a story within a story within a story. There are many good and bad points throught-out the story. The good points are that the story keeps you guessing and in supense. Also the bad point are that the story can be boring at times and another bad point is that I like when the story tells you every thing at the end of the holes book it sort of left you hanging, I wanted to know more about Zero's parents. Otherwise I really enjoyed the story and the ending was very suprising to find out who the Warden is. I hope that Louis Sachar comes out with a second book and will have many of my questions answered. I hope that other kids will like it the way I do."
3,My Holes Review,Holes is a good book this book had some good and bad points in it. One good thing is that it is sort of like a mystery. Also the book lets you think on how something is going to happen. Somtimes the book can be exiting and also it can also drag. The book can hit a high point in a story and then drop and let you hang.Some of the bad points are the book is keeping me handing and guesing and i don't like to wait. I like to know the answers right away. Otherwise i like the book. I hope Sachar one day gives us the answers.
4,HOLES Book,"I thought HOLES was a good book! I thought this because, it had a twist to it. Some of the good points about HOLES is that it had a surprising ending and Clyde ""Sweet Feet"" Livingston's foot odor was cured! I also like how the story was a story-within a story-within a story. The nicknames for the people were very amusing! Some of the bad points in the story HOLES is that sometimes the story would get confusing, but I also thought there should of been a better ending. Overall I thought HOLES was a good book!"
5,It is a good book for adults and kids,"In my English class my teacher Mrs.Humanick told us for half the year we are going to read a book called ""Holes"". In my mind I thought Holes was going to be a stupid book. But when I read it I really enjoy it. The book is for kids but I think adults will enjoy this book too. You should go see the movie too because it is very good. Believe when you see it you are not going to waste your money to see it. No wonder this book got the New Berry Medal Award. I really enjoy this book and I think you should but this book and read it."
3,A Great Reding Book,I like the book Holes because it was funny but it also was serious. Another reason I like the book was because it had flashbacks in it. I t would tell you what Stanley Yelnats III's great-great-grandfather didn't do. So the family and him got a curse on them. I also likeed it when Zero and Stanley became close friends. And Stanley helped Zero learn how to read and write. A funny part in the story was when Zero hit Mr.Pandanski with the shovel. Because Mr. Pandanski wouldn't stop making fun of Zero. My favorite part of the book was when Stanley and Zero found the treasure after they said that they would dig only one more hole. And also when Stanley that he wasn't going to leave Zero behind. It was good because Stanley's family got everything that they wanted. And Zero found his mother.
3,Great book if you havent seen the movie,"The book, Holes is a great book if you havent already seen the movie. I think the movie was better because its quicker and I personally dont like to read. It was an interesting book because the author was good at explaining the characters in the story and the setting. My favorite part in the book holes is at the end when they are stuck in the hole with the yellow spotted lizards, and they cant get out. I reccomend that you save your time and just go rent out the movie."
5,How to Tame a Fifth Grade Class,"I just finished reading Holes to my Fifth Graders. They were entranced, begging to hear it and groaning when I stopped. They enjoyed the story flashbacks and kept trying to guess the warden's connection to K.B. It is truly one of those books that hook kids on reading."
5,HOLES by Louis Sachar,"The main charecters in holes are Stanley Yelnats (caveman), Hector Zeroni(zero),Mr.Sir, Mr.Pendanski, and the Warden. Holes takes place in a camp named camp Camp Green Lake,but the lake had dried up years ago. The only structures around are two trees, the Wardens quarters, a few tents, a recreation room, and a lot of holes. The camp is for building charector, or is it? Stanley is framed of stealing a important pair of shoes. He can't help to think that it was the curse from his n-good-dirt-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather.Ithought the book Holes was a great book for ages 10-14. Holes was great,I couldn't put it down. It is very suspenseful and you will love the way Louis Sachar writes"
2,Why has this book won so many awards?,"Was drawn to this book after hearing about the film adaptation and reading the positive reviews from Amazon readers. I must say I was hugely let down by this book and I'm dumbfounded by how many literary awards it has received. The writing style is fairly straightforward with cardboard cutout villains up against a motley assortment of kids at some type of correctional facility in the desert. The only highlight of the book was the Kissin' Kate Barlow backstory which I enjoyed. The ending was laughable, like something taken from an old Scooby Doo cartoon."
2,Boring Read Says Teacher,"I thought that this book was just awful, and could not even finish it. I am about 100 pages away from the end and can't get myself to read it. The plot was ridiculously unusual, the characters obnoxious, and I highly discourage parents from having their children read it. I honestly don't understand how it won the Newbury Award...I guess that goes to show how awards aren't everything."
1,Dull,"I found the story to be dark, but without any real passion. The mythology about the Yelnats past was terribly unbelievable. There was nothing fun about the story. Just a bunch of kids in the middle of nowhere. The attempted humor was a fail.In these types of stories, it's sometimes typical for the bad guys to get their comeuppance. However, the villains in this story didn't get enough justice to be enjoyable. Plus, the ending was a bit too unrealistic.Also, the hanging out and eating a gazillion onions in the heat? Or Sploosh? Both recipes for a massive case of the runs and dehydration, not to mention blisters and pain from eating so many onions.Lastly, the writing was incredibly dry. Don't understand why this book was so popular. It must be because of the other stories he wrote, which were supposed to be excellent."
1,NOT the cover I wanted,"I'm ticked because I really specifically wanted the Holes Movie-Tie In cover. And instead, I received a generic beat up Holes cover. I'm tempted to return it."
3,I thought Holes was an interesting book but it lacked depth.,"I thought that Holes was a wonderful book. The way he fits everything into the ending was masterful. The suspense is enough to keep any young reader entranced. I did not have that much fun however, the grade-school dialouge and chilidish plot bored me as I am sure it would mature young readers and adults. Holes is a good storytime book for 4th graders but lets keep it at that level."
5,Fate versus Luck,"Holes by Louis Sacher is a very thrilling, exciting book for all ages. Go on an adventure with the two main characters, Stanley and Hector (Zero), for an amazing ride reader's will never forget. See the different struggles that they had to go through at Camp Green Lake, a ""bad boy"" detention center. Watch them overcome all the obstacles that are put in their paths, and finally how they discover something everyone has been looking for. This is an exciting story that everyone will love for ages to come.Holes by Louis Sacher is one of my favorite books. Even though I have read it many times throughout the past few years, it never gets old. I love that no matter how old I get, this book will be as exciting as the first time I read it. Holes is that type of boook that once you pick it up, no one would ever want to put it down. I can promise anyone that reads this book will not be sorry. Remember, not to check out the movie based of this thrilling book."
2,DIG MY REVEIW,We'll as i read the book it gets intresting by every page that I read. We'll I also like zeros charcter because every page I read about zero was exiting because when he stole the shoes in the shelter he thought that it was someones shoes so he said to stanley that he stoled clyde's shoes.
3,The Movie Is Better,"The book leaves out many significant details that the movie fills in. That is why it is better than the book. The story is the exact same, but it just seems a little more confusing."
4,Review of Holes By Rico,"I enjoyed the action and adventure of Holes. Holes is written by Louis Sachar. I recommend this book to all 4th& 5th graders. An important theme of this book is friendship. The main character, Stanley, has a family curse. Stanley was sent to a place called Camp Green Lake and that's where he and Zero meet. They become friends and they rescue each other. Read the book Holes to see if digging holes really does build character."
2,holes review,HOLES S A GOOD BUT IT'S NOT THAT GOOD.THIS IS A GOOD BOOK FOR PEOPLEOF ANY AGE. IT'S VERY WEIRD WHEN ZERO BEATS UP MR.PENDACKEY WITH A SHOVEL AKA MOM(MR.PENDACKEY).I BET WHEN U PICK UP THIS BOOK U WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PUT IT DOWN.
5,Grrrreat Book!,I found this book to be extremely delightful. It was a great read for me. I teach English to sixth graders and would recommend it to all my students. Mr. Sachar outdid himself. This is a book I will read over and over again.
3,The book was swell.,"I recently read the book holes and I found it to be very intriguing. It was'nt the best book I've ever read but, I must say I found it to be interesting and complicated. So if you were forced to read a book read this one."
2,"This book was ok,but I enjoyed the Wayside school books more","I""m glad I read it! It's hummorious and all but Mr. Sachars writting has changed a lot scince he wrote the Wayside School Books(WSB). I liked the way instead of writting ""Stanley dug Holes After holes, all through the book, he put story's in. About why he was digging holes."
3,very creative,"I happen to be a very popular Librarian. I have witnessed and read every childs book Louis Sachar is a very creative man, even though it might not have as good of reviews as J.K Rowling's Harry Potter books. I, personnaly, like Harry Potter better."
3,Interesting,"This is the first book I've read by Louis Sachar, and I liked it a lot. I would recommend this book to a younger audience, perhaps middle schoolers. I loved the ending because it left me wondering what else happened. But you had to pay attention to the little details because things that happened earlier in the book had an impact on the outcome."
4,Jamie Vue's Review,"This book is about a boy that got blamed for stealing shoes when someone who really did steal it threw it down and hit him in the head. This boy's name is ""Caveman."" He experienced something that he never had. He went to a camp and had to work hard. The camp was like a desert. It never rained. And ""Caveman"" blamed his grandfather beacause they all had bad luck."
4,A great story about freinds and cruelty of the world,"The book Holes is fantastic book about the world and reality.This book shows that not everthing will always go your way. For instance when Stanly Yelnats (the main character)is accused of commiting a crime that he did not do, he is shocked that the reality is that he is going to have to pay the time and go to Camp Green Lake. This book also brings out why people act the way they do. Lets take the warden for example she is a mean lady who runs the camp. Stanly can not find out why she is so mean, until he finds a piece of gold and the warden snatches it from him. Then Stanly starts to understand what the warden is after. He finds she is so mean because she wants the boys at the camp to dig her holes so that she can find more gold. Because she believes in a legend that states that there is gold buried somewhere on Camp Green Lake. So if you ever get a chance to read this book I would go for it."
3,Holes,Holes is an ok book because i found it boring. Stanly Yelnats was charged with stealing a famous baseball players shoes. He is sentenced to go to a camp for punisment. The name of the camp is Camp Green Lake. When he arrives there he finds out there is no lake. As punishment he has to dig a hole every day. He digs holes throughout the book untill he finds the treasure. He has a lawer come and get him when the warden tries to take the treasure. The book was still a little boring.
3,Digger all!,"The book I'm reviewing is called Holes by Louis Sachar. I give this book three stars. This book is about Stanley Yelnats. He is a loving boy, but his family is cursed. Unfortunately that part isn't the worst. He has to go to a camp because someone stole sneakers from an orphanage and the cops think that he stole them! A couple words to people who read this book.... it is very very boring & I'd rather sleep then read this story. But it also good in a way, because it is interesting because it makes you want to see what happens to Stanley!Emerson N.J. fifth grade student"
4,Holes,"Holes is a great adventure book for grades 4-9. It's very exciting and pulls the reader in quickly. i dropped 1 star because you can get sidetracked from the Kate Barlow stories, inside the main 'Stanly' story, although they do meet together and tie up quite nicely in the end.Go Louis Sacher!"
5,Digging,I really like this book because it has a real good ending to it and it is really adventurous. It's really exciting so I kept reading it and I like all of the characters so much.
4,Diggs,"1...""Find somthing interresting and give it to the warden."" Itis a from Holes. Stanly Yelnats the main character is accused of stealing and sent to Camp Green Lake. Well, its not your average camp. Unless you think that the average camp has you digging Holes all day to build character. NOT, Thats not the average camp to go to.2... This book reflected on me by speaking up for myself and to try to prove that im correct and not lying. Most people lie a lot and when thier telling the truth nobody belives them.3...A good story element for this book would be Irony, This book makes you think that hes going to a good camp for a year and he really goes to a horable camp to dig holes. And, it makes you think that he dies, but fourtunetly he lives.4...I recommend this book beacuse eveyone lies every now and then but when you do tell the truth make sure you know your telling the truth. Thats why i give it four stars. It couldve been five but it didnt end the way i thought it would."
4,HOLES,"In the book Holes a kid named Stanley Yelnats is sent to Camp Green Lake. His family thinks he was sent there because of his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather. Camp Green Lake is a boys' detention center where the boys build character by digging holes five feet wide and five feet deep. Stanley's father is also named Stanley and so is his father.At camp Stanley meets other kids with nicknames like Squid and Armpit. When he gets there he's just the new kid but later in the book, he's one of the guys. I really liked the book and I hope you do to, and I give it 4 stars. My favorite part about this book is when Zero goes missing and Stanley goes to find him. I didn't like it when Stanley sort of ignores Zero. I really liked the book and I hope you do to, and I give it 4 stars."
4,"Holes, A great book, by Louis Sachar!","Holes is a very interesting book about a fairly poor boy named Stanley Yelnats who was accused for stealing a famous persons shoes which was really just a case of the 'in the wrong place at the wrong time' situation. He was sentenced to a juvinile jail or a juvenile camp fo bad boys were they make you dig 5 ft. wide and 5 ft. deep holes in this dried up lake. Since he hadn't ever got a chance to go anywere, he chose the camp. When he got to the camp he met his camp mates who all had nicknames and his was Caveman. Since ive told you enough about the book itself, ill tell you what i think about it ... ITS A GREAT BOOK!!!!!"
5,TWO THUMBS UP!!!,"the best book for kids.unbeleivable novel by Louis Sachar.If you have kids going into 5th grade they'll love Holes.the majoraty in my classroom read it in 4th grade,but I started reading it first.get this book at your local book store now!!!in fact,it's a newbery winner!get it now,yor kids will love it!!!(and also good for parents!!!)"
5,Timeless Masterpiece,"I am a teen boy who has read ""Holes"" three times. I'm about to start on my fourth. It's just the greatest book of all time. There's no other way of putting it. Rich irony, meaningful drama, interconnecting storylines, superb writing...it's all here. The first time I read it, I didn't get the ending. Then, it just hit me like a ton of bricks. I was nearly moved to tears, and I will never forget that moment for as long as I live. I'd never been moved that deeply by a book, and I doubt that I ever will again."
4,"Peter Pan writes about the book ""Holes""","The Book ""Holes"", written by Louis Sachar is published in 1998. It's a story for young people who likes adventures.A mistake leads Stanley Yelnats to the prison camp for boys: Camp Green Lake. ""If you take a bad boy and make him dig every day in the hot sun, it will turn him into a good boy.""In the Camp it devellopes a friendship for life between Stanley and another fellow inmate Zero. A fight for survival begins...The book it simple to read and at the bottom of the pages are translated vocabs, too. Very excited book if you like danger and wildness. If you have also fantasy: Read it!-Peter Pan-"
5,All about Holes,I like the book Holes a lot. I like the book Holes because it is exciting and itn made me wan to keep reading. This book also had many adventurous times. I cant tell you though because oyu have to read the book to find out. Another reason I like the book Holes is because I always wanted to find out what Stanley or one of the other characters was going to do next.Thes are some of the reasons I like the book Holes!
3,(...) review,I will give it stars because the book was confusing. It is a story within a story within a story. The story is aboat a boy named Stanley who is in a camp called Camp Green Lake. The camp is for bad boys. You also get nicknames like Barf Bag. Nobody would probably not like to be in the camp because you work in the desert digging holes in the blazing sun and the holes are 4ft by 4ft . You are risking yorself for somebody else trying to find a treasure. There is hard words like perseverance.Ibet you did not know the warden can be a girl. Did you know that there is yellow spotted lizards that is more deadly than a rattlesnake. But I would still reccomend it to a lot of people because some people like it.
5,You are now entering Camp Green Lake!!!!,"Holes is a great book. Stanley is the main character in this story. In the story Stanley finds out a lot about his history and his future. Can nail polish really kill you? That is just one of the anwsers you will find out in this book. When you read it you will find out what characters are realated to others. This book has a lot of characters you will never forget throughout the whole book. Stanley goes to a camp named Camp Green Lake. Camp Green Lake has no lake, and Camp Green Lake is certainly not green! You will find out why in the book. This book is not just one story but a story within a story within a story."
4,5*5 Cheesesteak on the run.,This book may seem horrible by the cover. But don't be fooled!!! This is'nt a bad book. Let me give you the inside scoop. This bookisabout a boy named Stanley Yelnats his name is spelled the same forwards as it is backwards. that is called a palendrome. Ex: racecar. Stanley is a kid that just came out of 6th grade. He was walking from School on the last day of school. Apair of shoes from his favorate baseball player fell out of the sky. Thishappened because he was standing under a highway. He got arrested for that. The rest of the story is a secret!
5,This Book Rocks!,"The book is the one of the best I have ever read. In the last 5 years since I got the book, I have read it multiple times. The plot is one of the best because it connects multiple stories in the end. Towards the end, it makes you marvel at how they did this. I would recommend this to anyone!"
5,It's funny how reality can suddenly just hit you in the head,"Holes was very intriging; I couldn't put it down! Normally I'm not into books like these, but this one caught my eye and i loved it!"
4,Zero and Stanley's Adventure by Tiffany and Chrissy,"This is a good book about a boy named Stanley. Stanley got sent to a camp for something he didn't do. He arrives at camp and meets the warden and learns the rules. Stanely has to dig ,and they don't know what he has to dig. Stanley and a kid named Zero run awayStanley had many conflicts in this story. Three of the biggest conflicts were the Warden,Mr.Sir, and the sunflower seed bag. The first conflict is the Warden not doing anything about the lizards. She didn't care if they died because she wanted what was in the suitcase. The second biggest conflict was Mr. Sir not giving him water. The reason that he didn't give Stanley water was of what the warden did. The third and last opposing force was the sunflower seed bag. Magnet stole them and he got caught with them.I think you should read this if you like adventures. Holes is exciting in many different ways!!!"
5,My 6th graders begged for more!!!,"This interwinding and quick moving book kept 45 sixth graders captivated. This book allowed for great activities, class discussions, and self-enrichment for all students. It's a great treat to find such a FANTASTIC book! Thannnnk You, Sachar!!!! -An Educator"
3,"It was an okay book, not a great one for experienced readers","The book has some action and adventure but some parts were over-written, I mean repeated."
4,Uncover the Holes,"Mysteries, suspense, adventure, and humor... it's all inside this book ""Holes, winner of the Newberry Medal. This book is interesting and easy to understand. You could figure out what this book is about just by judging it's cover. The story begins with a boy named Stanley Yelnats. It was said that Stanley's family is under a curse, find out how that happened by reading the book. Anyways, lets get back to Stanley, Stanley was walking down the street when a pair of sneakers fell on him and you won't believe what happens next, he gets sent to Camp Green Lake where he met some new friends. Discover a ""hole"" lot of mysteries."
4,Holes better then just a depression,"While patently waiting for the new Harry Potter to come out I was recommended this book. At first I wasn't thrilled with it, it seemed to move a bit slowly (hence the 4 star rating) but once I got into it, I was completely enthralled. The book does an excellent job of telling a moral tale without hitting you over the head with the moralI'm a 25 year old woman with no children and I enjoyed it, I think this book transends age and tells and excellent storyBuy it, read it!"
3,"holes,an average book","so,you would like to read holes.Well,I'd sayit is an average book and any one with an imaginationcould easily read this.There is alot of flash backsthough and was also a little confusing but you would get to like it."
4,good premise and plot,"I like the structure of the story. Mishandled, the symmetry of the strong plot could've come off as corny, but I think it's well done."
4,Holes,"Holes is about a young boy namd Stanley. His family has a history of bad luck. One day, Stanley was just walkng and shoes came flying out of nowhere. It turned out that they were famous shoes and the police came after him. When he was caught, he went to court and was sentenced to go to Camp Green Lake. Camp Green Lake isn't really a lake, just a very dry piece of land that was once a lake. Each day the children had to dig holes five feet wide and five feet deep. It was said that they were supposed to build ""character"" and to teach the boys a lesson. When really, there was something in the ground somewhere. What was it? You'll have to read and find out. I would highly recomend this book. It is very well written and described. The plot is easy to follow and is very interesting."
4,holes,"This is a great book. I would recommend this book to other people because it keeps you wonting to read more. The beginning was very sluggish, but towered the middle it got really good! This was the part where I couldn't put the book down. That night I finished the book before I went to bed. It has good realalistic characters and a great storyline. It's a good quick read that I would recommend this book to anybody."
5,An awsome book,Holes is one of the best books I ever read.I didn't like the ending because it was too short and it didn't say much either. I would recommend Holes to someone who likes adventure books.
5,Holes-a hole different world,This book was worthy of rewarding the Newbery Medal. This book was suspenseful and very well written. Stanley is sent to a camp because he was acused of stealing sneakers. It took him awhile to be acepted into the group. Eventually he became part of the pack. read the book it is great.
4,Dig it up,"""It's because of my no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather,"" Stanley Yelnats says in grief. Stanley then really believed that his great-great grandfather was the reason he was at Camp Green Lake. After being arrested, it's either that or jail.At Camp Green Lake, Stanley dug holes, everyday. He became a man, a strong, tough man. Also he found something very important... friendship.I love this book, my favorite thing was how it changes from present to past. I would recommend this book to kids 10 years old and older. Everyone will love this book!"
4,Holes,"The book Holes is a well written fiction book by Louis Sachar. The book was all right exept the part about his great great grampa. I enjoyed reading the book with my class, I disliked the extra work after reading. The story made little sense in the start to me but it all changed by the end of the book. It also got more interesting, for example when Stanley and Zero ran away from Camp Green Lake. I also liked the happy ending."
5,best book for all ages/heart touching,holes is a very good book that teaches young people about stanly yelnats life and the way it is in life. it is a book that you must pay vey close atention to and pay attention to all names and initials of the characters. i would reccomend this book to any one that came up to me and asked me about good books for them or their children.
1,We must be missing something!!!!!!!,"My 11-year-old son and I read every night and in late spring we read Holes. We were both excited because we'd heard it was excellent. We both hated it! We found it dark, dreary and depressing. I have read many reviews and heard many comments lauding its circular storyline, but I found the story ridiculous and unappealing. We struggled through to the end and heaved sighs of relief when we finished."
2,Very dark and very politically correct,"The book is very dark. For almost the entire story, the maincharacter is in a prison work camp or is nearly dying of thirst in thedesert. Even the happy ending is told in an almost joyless way.Though marketed as a children's book, the story contains serious adult themes, including the lynching of a black man. Other themes are very politically correct -- none of the inmates at the prison camp have committed a serious crime; authority figures are corrupt and stupid; and lawyers (ugh!) will save the day in the end (see, I told you it was a joyless ending). This type of dreary ""award winning"" book is what makes Harry Potter so refreshing and so successful."
2,Holes,this book is about a boy named Stanley Yelnats and Zero thay go to camp to geter and zero runes a way from camp and stanley goes to find him and thay eat onines that i think about the book is that it is a ok book but not to good ang it tackes a lot of time to reads this book theve is a parts that have mess up
4,Eli Peterson,"Stanley Yelnats thinks that he has destiny,but he doesn't know that his favorite baseball player will hate him for it.He has to go to court and the judge gives him a decision to go to Camp Green Lake or jail.I would have chose camp,but you have to read the book to find out.Stanley meets this boy named Zero and they become friends and I think they will become tight until the end.When Stanley is digging a hole he gets in a lot of trouble.Will he survive,or will he get away because the warden is nice read the book to find out if he is at camp or jail and will he survive.Duh Duh Duh!"
5,"If you have the time, read it!",This holes book is the best book I had ever read. It has a wonderful adventure. You can not put the book down. I think Louis Sachar had written a fantastic and desiring book to read. All my comments on Holes are positive!
3,Holes is a good book,This is one of my favorite books. It is about this kid Standley Yelnats who is under a curse because of his great great great grand father. When he is sent to a boys detention center and forced to dig five feet deep and five feet wide holes he sees the extent of his curse. After a while he gets suspicious about the hole digging. After a little investigation he finds out that the warden is searching for something and it is buried somewhere out in the hot desert.I liked the characters they were well developed and you could almost see them they sounded so real.I think really any teen could enjoy this book.
5,The Truth,"Holes may be about digging holes, but it's about something else to. It's about a boy who learns alot about himself and finds strength inside, where others did not. I recommend this book to those who like to read. If you don't like to read you may not like it."
3,Whadda Book!,"Holes was a good book about Camp Green Lake. The camp is not green and is not a lake. I did not think that this was such a great book for kids as it was for adults. It was very strange, and I didn't like the flashbacks because they made everything so confusing, so you didn't know if it was the present or the past. But other than that it was a good book."
5,Holes,This is a really good book.Everyone I am telling you that you should read this book.But if you don't want to I understand.I will not force you to.But please read this book.
5,Awesome,I loved it the whole story was so touching I just wished there was a sequel to finish it off
3,There Are A Lot Of Holes In This Story,"Anyone who likes an interesting funny, light-hearted book would enjoy the story Holes. The characters were fun and they were all easy to understand. The story itself wasn't as believable as it could be because there were some things that the law would never be able to pass. Some how though, while you read the book you just don't think about that. Over all, the book Holes was a really good book."
4,Great Book,"This book is about a boy named Stanley Yelnats. This story happened when he was walking home from school and had a pair of shoes drop on him. He didn't know whose shoes they were. It turns out they had been a famous mans shoes at an auction. They where selling them at a charity. Stanly had to go to a camp called camp green lake or he had to go to jail. He had chose camp green lake. When he got there, he saw that there was no lake. He had no idea what was going to happen next. I would recommend this book because it is a good read. Many people like this book. I hope you enjoy this book."
4,To Dig or Not to Dig?,"Louis Sacher does a fantastic job leaving the reader wanting more. The storyline is both stimulating and clever. The reader is constantly asking him/herself questions throughout the story, wondering how different elements connect, or if they do at all. Using dual plots, Sacher takes the reader for a ride, back and forth, from the days of the Wild West to the present time. Incorporating a hint of ethnic diversity, students will learn about the idea of myths and cultural beliefs. Middle school children will appreciate the characters and their relationships with one another, possibly wanting to learn more about their own ancestors and heritage (Maybe there is some big family secret lurking out there, waiting to be discovered!). They can learn what it means to hold onto your roots and they will enjoy the banter that goes on between the inmates of the camp. One weakness may be the dual plots, possibly confusing readers as they jump back and forth from past to present."
2,Holes by Louis Sachar,"Holes is one of my all time favourite books. The plot is unique and exciting. An overweight boy called stanley gets sent to Camp Green-lake because of a crime he did not commit. What do they do all day?They dig holes. They dig one hole a day in the hot texas sun. They aren't even allowed one bit of the shade. Because the warden owns the shade. But why, you ask, are they digging holes. Some say to build character, some say they are looking for something. But what?What's going on, what is the secret of camp greenlake?find out, in this amazing, funny and absolutely perfect masterpiece of a novel!"
5,Holes,"If you like a book with blood and excitement this would be your book. This book is interesting throughout every chapter. This book make you want to keep flipping the pages.The nick names of these characters are really good. One of these characters is Zero. Zero is one of the main characters in this book.Stanley Yelnats gets good friends like, X-ray, Armpit, and Mr. Padinski. They are sometimes mean, but most of the time they are really good friends. He is just lucky that he has friends like that. He and his friends are in Camp Green Lake. He is there because he stole a pair of shoes, but not any shoes, a famous baseball player's shoes. That baseball player's nickname is ""Sweaty Feet"". I recommend this book to any reader."
4,Holes,"Title - HolesAuthor - Louis SacharThe main character of my book is Stanley Yelnats. Stanley had a great great grandfather who stole a pig, and now his family is cursed. Stanley got blamed for stealing someone's shoes, but he really didn't. At court, the judge gives him a choice of either going to jail, or going to Camp Greenlake. Stanley chooses Camp Greenlake, where he must dig holes exactly five feet deep and five feet wide.The plot is that Stanley has a curse on his family, and he is sent to do time for a crime he didn't commit.The story takes place at Camp Greenlake.The theme to the story is that if you keep digging, you'll eventually get to the truth. Stanley thinks he's just wasting time at Camp Greenlake by digging holes, but soon he discovers the truth for why, and that things are not as they appear.I rated it 4 out of 5 stars so it was pretty good.By Ryan Hibler"
4,Holes,I liked the book Holes.It had a very good begining and ending.I give this book a five out of five because it was a good kids book.This book tells about a kid named Stanley Yelnats who gets in trouble for stealing a pair of shoes and gets sent to Camp Green Lake.Stanley gets there and dosnt see a lake he is wondering what he has to do there for the next nine months.He made some freinds at Camp Green Lake.Those were the kids that he had to dig holes with.If you were brought upon this book you should invest time in reading it.
4,"Interesting, but...","This book was interesting but it's not something I'd read a second time. The plot was great but it took too long to get to the ending. There wasn't MUCH wrong with the book, its just that it got tiresome and boring in the middle, where almost the same exact thing happen over and over. I give this book 4 stars because its good, but it isn't the best I've read. I'd recomend this to anyone who's in need of something to do."
4,holes,The book I read was Holes and I thought it was a very good book. It made you wanting to keeping reading it because you didn`t know what was goin to happen next. The book was also good because it taught friendship and how to care for people you like even tough u hardly know them. What really got to me was the part when Stanley the main character carried Zero up the mountain instead of leaving him and then found out that you need water to make mud. After he figured that out he dug a holde and found water to give to Zero and himself so they wouldnt dehydrate and die. I also thought it was nice of nice of Stanley to teach Zero how to read and write even tough the counselers thought of Zero as nothing. Stanley also showed respect for Zero by not asking questions that Zero would get mad at. Overall I thought this book was very good and I rate it with a four. I would encourage people of all ages to read this book because they would enjoy it.
5,Holes by Louis Sachar,"I purchased this book as required reading for my son. I always try to read what he does so we can discuss it and it's characters. (Besides I love to read)I was pleasantly suprised when I read Holes...it had interesting characters, and I enjoyed the way the story developed. I found myself enjoying the story and wished there was a continuing adventure for Stanley Yelnats. I am quite sure that he would manage to find an adventure no matter what he did."
5,Stanley and Camp Green Lake,"Stanley Yelnats is under a curse. A curse that began with his no good dirty rotten pig stealen great great grandfather. Some people think Stanley stole sweet shoes. Then when he went to Camp Green Lake Mr. sir said its not girl scouts. He stayed in tent D. There he met armpit, Zero, X-ray ,and Mr. Pendancekey. When Stanley was done digging his hole he went to the wreak room to write to his mom. When he was writing to his mom Zero asked if Stanley would teach him to read and write.And Zero would dig a little bit of Stanley hole."
4,THis is a great Book!!!!,"The book Holes, written by Louis Sachar, is a strange yet interesting book that tells about a teenage boy who is forced to dig 1 hole a day at a juvenile detention center for boys. He was sent here for a crime he didn't commit. There were many things I liked and disliked about this book. One of the things I disliked was the ending. It seemed to end to abruptly and it seemed unfinished. Yet there were many things I liked alot about the book. The author creates a way for the reader to feel like all of this is happening to them. The feeling of confusion and fear really helped the reader to understand the actions and feelings of the characters. I would definatly read this book again."
3,Holes is a hole in one!,"The book I'm writing about is Holes by Louis Sachar. I think it deserves three stars. If I could pick a book to read over the summer, I would pick Holes. It is great because it's a book about how two kids work together to find something at Camp Green Lake! A real problem is that they have to dig holes five-feet-long and five-feet-wide. They have to do this everyday. I would recommend this book to everybody.Emerson, NJ; Fifth Grade Student"
5,I can dig it,"Holes by Louis Sachar is about a young boy named Stanley Yelnats, who had a curse from his great-great grandfather. One day while he was walking under a bridge when a pair of baseball cleats hits him on top of his head. The shoes belonged to Clyde Livingston, a great baseball player. They had been stolen, when the police saw Stanley with the cleats they thought Stanley stole the shoes.Stanley was arrested and sent to camp greenlake for 24 months. While there Stanley met new and exciting characters. Throughtout the time boys at camp greenlake had to dig a hole that was 15 ft. wide and 15 ft. long. Stanley had great battles with all the boys, made friends with some of them there. By: Jonathan Anderson"
3,Didn't dig it,Holes got too much hype. I didn't find it as interesting as all the people I talked to said it was. It's not bad though. Just not the gripping soon to be classic that some said it would be.
5,Holes,Holes is a real good book. It's about a kid who goes to Camp Green Lake for a crime he didn't even do. The boy's name is Stanley Yelnats. He is blaming it to be a curse from his great great grandfather. Now he has to dig holes for his punishment. One of his friends that he makes at the camp runs away. Then a day later he runs away to look for him. It's a real good book. Everone that I knew who had read it thinks so too. If you were the type who like adventure books you think the same.
5,"Holes, an exciting adventure","Holes by Louis Sachar is a thrilling adventure. A boy named Stanley Yelnats was accused of theft. He was given a choice, to go to prison or Camp Green Lake. He chose Camp Green Lake, a dried out waste land. It is a boy detenion center where bad boys are sent and has to dig five feet long and five feet deep holes, to build character. But it's not just building character, the Warden of the camp is looking for something, treasure. This book has lots of surprises that puzzles you and an page turning adventure."
3,Holes the AWSOME BOOK!!!!!!!!,"I think the book holes by Louis Sachar is a good book. The book was about a boy name stanley yelnats that was sentence to Camp Greenlake for stealing Clyde Livingstons shoes.It was either Camp greenake or prison.stanley said Camp Greenlake because he never gone to camp before.When Stanley got there,their was older boys that was punish. they always dug a five feet deep and a five feet diameter hole. A boy name zero that never talks .Zero loves too dig holes.When Zero runs away stanley runs after.when they find big thumb Zero gets sick they rested for a week or so. They live off of water under ground and off of onions."

5,"Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful","At first I thought it was a bit dark for the age level, however, one into the book it was facinating and I could not put it down. I'm glad it won the newbury award!"
4,Kid's review,"At first, when I saw the book cover I thought it would be boring. But it was actually very exciting by about the fifth chapter and on. It is awesome because it has lots of cool adventure in it. This book is good reading for any age!"
5,I recommend it.,"I didn't realize when I bought this, that is was for a younger audience, but I read it anyway, and I'm glad I did. This is a great book, a fun read with a twist at the end (that I probably should have seen coming, but didn't). It's a ""tall tale"", but well told and fun."
5,Truly Fantastic!!!,"I ordered, and quickly read, Holes over the summer after receiving it from amazon.com. I teach fifth grade and I read this book to my class early in the year. Every time I stopped reading my students groaned aloud, as they could not wait to hear about what was going to happen next to Stanley, Zero, the boys of Camp Green Lake, and Kissin' Kate Barlow. A fantastic book with interesting twists and a wonderful message for all. I highly recommend it!"
5,Holes by Louis Sachar,"An interesting and gripping story with a surprising and very happy ending. I loved it.Happy Christmas to you,love,Susan Caton"
1,I do not Know why I am typing this.,I do not know why I am typing this eather and I have not read this book
1,Terrible,THis book is very bad. It stunk up my whole room while I read it.Louis Sachar USED to be good.
2,Overachaved,I thought that holes was going to be a good book. I thought it was a slow pacing book at the begining. It didn't intrest me at all. I got a diffrent book to read instead of reading Holes. I enjoyed it much better.
5,the fantastic book,"This book HOLES is about a kid named ""Stanly yelnats"" who has to go to a rotten prison called ""Camp Green Lake"". But Stanly meets this kid named Zero. But then Stanly and Zero come to some problems do they become friends or not? What i liked best about this book is when it goes way back in time.I could never put this book down it always made me think about stanly's NO GOOD DIRTY-ROTTEN PIG STEALING GREAT- GREAT- GRANDFATHER.The people who i think would like this book is people who like cliff-hangers or mysteries."
5,Holes,I like this story because it is about advenure and it's about hope. I also like the story because when I started to read it I predicted that the main character Stanley Yelnats the 4th was going to find the teasure that a lady name Kissing Kate Barrow stole from his grandfather Stanley Yelnats the 1st . I also like when Stanley the 4th and he friend Zero dig there last hole and found the teasure that was a wonderful part of the story.
3,"Ron D Miller Place, NY",This book is about a boy named stanley yelnats who had very bad luck. One day a pair of shoes hits him in the head and you soon find out that those pairs of shoes belonged to a famous baseball player and he ends up getting accused for it. His punishment is he is sent to Camp Green Lake were he has to dig holes every single day. He finds out that not only are they digging for a punishment but the people at the camp have them digging for something else. Stanley eventually runs away. This book is full of adventure and if u like adventure books you will enjoy it.
4,The Mystery of Holes,"The main characters are Zero,Stanely,armpits,ZigZag,Manget and if they get in trouble you have to go to this camp and dig holes and they had to go because they were stealing cars and shoes and to get food,water they had to dig six foot hole and they couldn't write they until they do what they are told to do.And it was one boy named zero that couldn't read or write so Stanley tought him how to read and zero would help him dig his holes.Then Manget told the new boy if he find something then give it to him and Manget why should you get a day off and you just got here."
5,Hole lot of great writing,"You must have the basic plot by now from the write-ups and the other reviews.I just wanted to add my two cents in praise of this wonderfully crafted piece of literature. While simply written (""understated"" is a huge overstatement) there is a requirement to read carefully. Each and every bit of story is carefully crafted and lovingly placed in just the right spot. There is not a word or a sentence that does not add to the book.Miss a paragraph and you miss a lot. Miss this novel and there will be a hole in your collection of great books."
3,Average...fairly interesting.,"I was only vaguely impressed with this book. Louis Sacher, also the author of the hilairious but juvinile WaYsIdE sChOOl books, was my favorite author in 3rd grade (I am now in 8th) but I can't understand what drove him to write HOLES. Humor was Sacher's strength, and he sort of let that strength go in this book. Although it was well-written, I don't think it is that good a read for children or adults. Rather boring and typical."
3,"Good, but very grim and gruesome; routine, casual cruelty","This book is well written and has interesting plot twists. Its depictions of the harsh cruelty in a boys' prison camp are disturbing, however. Had I know about them, I would not have bought this book for my nine year old."
4,Holes Review,"A pair of 10-year old girls in New York Holes is a fantastic book. It's about a boy named Stanley, he has bad luck. He gets arrested for something he didn't do and goes to Camp Green Lake. He doesn't realize that it's not a camp and doesn't have a lake. It is almost like a desert. The warden makes all the boys dig a hole per day. There was a boy there named Zero and Stanley was teaching him how to read and write for a trade of Zero digging part of his hole. Zero hated to dig holes so one day he ran away, Stanley going after him. He found Zero in a boat, he survived by drinking ""sploosh"". Stanley noticed the weird shape of the mountain, it looked like a thumbs-up. They climbed the mountain and they survived by drinking dirty water and eating onions. This is all that we're going to say because we want you to read this fantastic book!"
5,Holes - The Attention Getter,"Holes,which is by Louis Sacher, is a veryinteresting book. It gets your attention and keeps it. I would recommend it to kids in the fourth,fifth,and sixth graders because it would most likely be too hard for third graders and up. I think Louis Sachar will be the next Roald Dahl because of his creative and comedic writing style. He has the skills and talent to become a great writer even further more than he alredy is."
3,What I Thought,"This book was about a kid named Stanley Yelnats. He was sent to a detention camp for stealing some shoes. The camp was run by a mean warden who made the boys dig holes in search of buried treasure. Stanley and a boy named Zero escaped from the camp. I won't give away the ending, but they had a good adventure and it ended well. This book was okay, but it moved slowly."
4,"Good, easy, read..","HOLES is a good book, a little goofy, but keeps your intrest and is very easy to understand. It is truly a diffferent style of book...it's not everday you read an interesting book about kids who dig holes all day, but this is an exception!"
5,BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Louis Sachar does the best he's ever done by telling two stories at once and the characters are out of this world. I want to find out about the new sequel that is coming out. I can't wait!
5,"A great book! I loved ""Holes""!!!","I am 17 years old and I loved the book ""Holes"". I have had to lend my copy to all of my friends as well. I liked that the main character (Stanley Yelnats....look at it backwards) was sent away even though he was not guilty. He learned from his experience and it made him a better person. This is the best book I've read all year (and the only one I've finished in a long time)."
4,Holes,"The book holes is about a young boy named Stanley yelnats his family was cursed by the madame zeroni an old fortune teller she told stanley's no- good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing great great grandfather named ""Elya yelnats"" that he had to carry madame zeroni's pig to the top of the mountain to get the pig fat and juicy so he could marry this girl named ""Myra"" her dad wanted Igor to marry his daughter and he didn't want her to marry Elya so Elya carried the pig evey morning to the top of the hill and he promised madame zeroni the he would carry her to the top of the hill and sing her the song she thought him and instead he went to the americas to find madame zeroni's son and so he fgoes to the americas and he falls in love with the girl named Sarah Miller but first he learns to speak english and he translates the song from latvian to english these are some reasons I like this book"
3,Great entertainment,"HolesHave you ever been in a place that is super hot well in the book Holes by ""Louis Sachar"", young boy goes to a camp which is located in the desert. Stanley Yelnats is young boy whom goes to a camp of kids who don't want to go to jail but go to this camp instead. This camp makes all of them boys realize their mistakes. Stanley had to learn how to make friends without him making the wrong friends who might make him somebody he doesn't want. Stanley makes new friends and a lot of money. One dislike of this book is that I didn't really understand if when Madame Loiselle gets to go to the mountain. This book is really is interesting and really funny."
4,Holes is such a good book!,"This book has to be one of my favorite books! Although I thought it was a little confusing, I love Holes. Right when I started to read this book, I just fell in love with the characters."
5,The Best Book I've Ever Read!!!!,"This book was so good! It tells about the hardships a kid goes through and you can make great freinds in unexpected places. And you should expect it being a good book sence they made a movie of it and now a sequal to this book named "" Small Steps"" I would recomend this book to anyone of any age even if you just like action books beause there is enough happning to hold your attention!"
5,The Best Book Ever,"This was one of Luis's best masterpieces. This non-stop page turning book will keep you on the edge of your seat and it keeps you wondering what will happen next to Stanley Yelnants. Anyone who is looking to read a book that is fun and easy to read is going to be amazed. I have not heard anyone say anything bad about this book. I couldn't wait to get my hands on it when it first came out. actually this book was so good that it had a movie made after it. Luis is an adult, but knows what a kid likes and laughs at. therefore i give this book five stars."
4,Holes is a great book.,"The novel is about a boy named Stanley who was arrested for a crime, which he didn't do. So he was sent to Camp Green Lake. Once there was a Lake changes into a dry land, years by years. There Stanley, and all the campers have to dig a hole every day under a cruel condition to build their character. Stanley finds a good friend and together they have to survive dangerous adventures.This book is pretty good and it teaches us about relationship between friends. I suggest that everyone should read this book and like it as much as I do.(Reviewers: Ananda Sudharto)"
2,READ THIS BOOK,"The novel Holes"" is about a boy named Stanley who was sentenced for a crime he did not commit. He was sent to a juvenile correctional facility named Camp Green Lake. Camp Green Lake lies in the desert and there is neither any green nor any lake. The boys have to dig holes under inhuman conditions. Stanley meets Zero with whom he flees out of the camp into the desert with nearly no water...""Holes"" is located in the desert to stress the dependency and helplessness of the offenders.There are many different and interesting characters, but the most important figures are Stanley and Zero.The main conflict is about the friendship (between Stanley and Zero) and the curse.The story has got an astonishing ending."
5,Lots of holes,"My book is about some kids that get in trouble so they come tothis concentration camp, in the middle of the lake that is dried up. I like this book because it has suspense and it is also funny. Some of the charecters names are Zero, X-Ray, Stanly, Zigzag, The warden, and Mr.Sir."
4,Powerful,"This book is powerful and sad. It shows that ""criminals"" are not always what they seem, espesially children. I recommend it for all!!!!!"
5,Excellent!,This is an excellent adventure of a young boy who is down on his luck. My students LOVE this book! It is an easy reading book that you just can't put down. You have to keep reading to find out what is going to happen next. Great book!
5,Holes,"This book was quite unusual. It was weird but not too weird the plot was imaginitive and inventive. The book is an intricate jigsaw puzzle which keeps you guessing untill the end. Stanley Yelnats is unjustly sent to Camp Green Lake boy's detention center. There is no lake, and nothing is green except for two giant oak trees,between which is stretched a hammock the hammock.The hammock belongs to the Camp Warden, and nobody can lie in it but her .The Camp Warden makes everybody dig one hole five feet deep and five foot wide everyday.After a while it becomes clear to Stanley that she isn't just trying to build character,but that she is looking for something. But what could be buried in the middle of the desert? I highly reccomend this book."
2,a chool review for br ....... khan,i liked it alout and i thout that if you are looking for a nice book that you can read and get in to it you should buy it.my faverit part was when stanly got introuble for stealing sun flower seads from mr sir and he didn't even have one seed
5,The no good dirty rotten pig stealing review,"Que pasa!!!!!!Mango says this is a pheneomonal , extraordinary ,and majestic book.The BOOK is funny and heartrending.The book is full of laughs and tears.I haven't read a book with so much plot.I give this book two thumbs way way way way way way way its up there with Harry Potter.This fabulous book covers three genereations of the Yelnats family.Mango says this book is sweeter and phater than him.If only, If only you shared my enthusiasm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,how mach I like the bookLthink the book is,I think the book is ok because the book tells two storys in one and some parts are boring and some parts are ok and in the end is happy because this kid lost his mother and in the end he finds her
5,A Review for Holes,"Holes by Louis Sachar is about a boy named Stanley Yelnats. The story takes place in the present time. Stanley Yelnats is overweight, his apartment always smells like shoes and people make fun of him. Stanley has a series of bad things happening in his life. A professional athlete's shoes fall on his head. Stanley was accused of stealing. In court he had a choice of going to jail or going to Camp Green Lake. At camp he is required to dig one hole a day, five feet deep and five feet wide. He met a boy named Zero there who has something to do with the curse on his family. I really liked this story."
4,this is a really good book,I gave this book four stars because it was interesting and fun to read. It was really exciting. He learns valuable lessons at a camp for bad boys. I would recomend this book to just about anyone. It was a great book.
4,Good Book!,"Holes is a great book!!!It's funny and exicting!I read it for the english festival!!!It was my favorite out of all the 6 books we had to read.Thats why I am writing a good review for it!!If you like really funny stories,you should read this book!!!!"
5,Holes is Great,I had to read this book for a graduate class. I was very impressed with the characters and how their behavior relates to today's teenagers. I have now read the book 2 more times and can't wait to see the movie. A must read.
4,holes,I liked this book. I would reccomend it to all kids.I gave it a four star because I thought it was an exciting and interesting.Somtimes it can get cofusing when he has flashbacks.Another reason why I liked it is because it was about a kid who was overweight and didn't have very much friends but when he went to Camp Green Lake he learned to be disipline and he lost weight and he made more friends.I enjoyed reading it alot. I wish the author would make a sequel but he's not going to. I think I've only read one other book that was better. I didn't give it a five star because I didn't understand some of it. I really liked this book alot.
4,Full of Suspense!,"I thought this book was good. I will admit I've read better, but it was still good. I would recommend it. It was suspensful and interesting. It was sort of a mystery. I rate it a 4 because, it could've been better. The characters were pretty good and it had a decent plot. My favorite character was Zero. I thought he was tough and showed he had the guts to run away from camp Green Lake. So, go ahead and read it. I think you'll like it."
4,A really great read!,"Holes is a exellent book for people who like a little mystery and a little adventure. Back to the point, Holes is a book about a boy named Stanley Yelnats. His family is very poor(his name is spelled the same front and back).He is acused of stealing shoes and given a choice between jail and a place called Camp Green Lake. Of course he picks Green Lake. At Camp Green Lake, Stanley makes friends he never had. All the kids have wierd nicknames like Caveman, Armpit, Zig Zag, Zero and some more.During his stay at Camp Green Lake, Stanley finds something that belonged to an outlaw, the same outlaw that robbed his family a hundred years ago. This makes his family very rich and the family of his new found best friend, also.The book has a great and unexpected ending. It has recently been made into a movie and I can't wait to see it."
4,Engaging Adventure,"A good versus evil adventure among young delinquents that tells some history and delves into the pysche of teenage boys. I didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised by the grit of this teenage targeted novel."
5,This book left no Holes in my brain,"This is defiantly one of the best books I have ever read. The audience for this book is young adult, ages 12-18. I also think that everyone; any age can also enjoy this book. The theme in this book is a very good one, one that most people can relate too. The theme is to keep trying, never stop, despite how hard things are. The characters in this book are well developed especially Stanley. Most of the time the plot is very interesting, and easy to follow, but when the author, Louis Sachar, goes into detail about the history of Camp Green Lake, the book gets a little boring. This book brought many emotions to me. For example, I felt sorry for Stanley throughout the whole book, because he was innocent and wrongly accused, and had to suffer for it. My overall impression of this book was great. After reading it, it is now my favorite book for sure. It is funny, interesting, and always kept my attention. I have to give it a ten out of ten."
5,Holes the incredible journey,"I gave HOLES a 5 star score because I loved the action. Stanley yelnatswas accused for stealing clyde liverstons shoes. He was sent to camp green lake . Stanley made a friend with a boy named zero, a silent child.zero ran a way ,while stanley tryed to find a way to get him back. They tryed to reach big thumb ,they ate onions,and dug more holes. My Favorite part was when the warden put nail polish with snake venume in it .She slaped mr .sir and he went nuts .Thats my review on holes."
3,Why holes isn't my favorite,I thouht the book was okay because they have all of those flash backs that really gets confusing. But I like the part where Stanley walks in and he meets all the people in tent dand he finds out that they all have freaky names.and thats why I gave it 3 stars.
5,"A book for kids who don't read for fun, or so they think!!","I bought this incredible book after a reccommendation from a friend. I read it first, before my son. I read this book in 3 days, between housework and activities. I could not put it down. Then I gave it to my 11 year old son and said, ""Just read two pages, that's all."" He read thirty pages. In less than a week he finished the book. Now we talk about the story all the time. He loved it. This book is for kids, parents, you name it. I will never forget this book!!"
5,It gets better the farther into the story you get!,"Wow! I thought I'd get depressed reading this story but I was so compelled to go on just to see how Stanley held up under the enormous pressure and injustices. He kept on thinking and working when others would have given up. I love his spirit and his perseverence, resilience and lack of cynicism. I ""tried it out"" on my fifth grade son and was sure he'd reject it... but he never put it down. I encouraged him to get through the first few chapters and it would get better. He did and he loved it too! Food for thought and discussions for weeks and even months."
4,Take my recommendation!,"I think the book Holes was really good. This book had strong and weak points. Some strong points were that Sachar had a lot of characters, and had a story. Some weak points were that Louis Sachar ended the story real fast, and that there were some real mean kids. These are all the reasons why I thought this book was really good."
3,Christina's Review,"HOLES is a story within a story, within a story, within a story.I thought that HOLES was a good book. I thought that the parts about Kate Barlow were exciting. I didn't really like the ending because I don't think it goes into a lot of detail. I expeted more. I also didn't like the parts when Stanley and Zero were just walking in the desert for like weeks. I thought that it was the boring part. I also liked the part when the lizards were climbing on Stanley and Zero because of the onions. I really did think that Stanley and Zero were going to get bitten. If there is a HOLES 2, I will surely read it."
4,A review of holes,This book has strong points and Week points I will tell you my strong and week points about this book..my strong points are is i like about holes is i love how the auther writes about how everything is happening in this book and the way he lets you in on everything i also like how it goes back in time.There are also some weak points in this book like the way sachar will go in to a mystery and not continue also if he puts Stanley and Zero in an area ex.Desert he leaves them there for a while with nothing interesting happening.then he leads Stanley and zero back to Camp Green lake.But other wise the weak points i thought book was ok and i am happy stanley got back home and zero hasd come in contact with his mother once again.
5,Holes BY: Louis Sachar,"Hi! I'm Ryan. I'm from Gettysburg Area Middle School. I want to tell you a little bit about the book, Holes. This book was a really great book. It makes you want to read on and on until you are finished. It's about a boy named Stanley Yelnats. He's an overweight boy that always gets in trouble. He goes to a camp for bad kids and has to dig holes every day. That's supposed to build character, and make him become a good boy. He makes a lot of friends with weird with weird nicknames. Near the end of the book one of Stanley's friends gets bit by a highly venomous yellow spotted lizard. Stanley saves him and gets to go home from the camp. I highly recommend this book to anybody. Read this book and you'll agree."
4,A very interesting story,"This book tells you about a boy named Stanley Yelnats and he is getting sent to a camp called "" Camp Green Lake"" because he's getting acused for stealing a pair of sneakers and which he really didn't.So when he gets sent he ends up meeting new friends Zero, Barfbag,Zigzag,X-ray and Armpit where all his friends. And the next day he has to start digging 5 feet holes by 5feet wide.And if you want to find out what happens next then read ""HOLES"" by Louis Sachar."
4,it was a good book,Well the book was good. It strated when zero threw the shoes to stanley.Well it was funny when he was dressing so he cuold put his cloths.When stanley went to camp he thought there was a lake.Well when stanley told mr.sir if they were digging holes.Well they were looking for the teasure for the warden.
5,Zero runs away from Camp Green Lake,This was my favorite book . The part I liked was when Zero hit Mr. pendanski in the face. Zero takes the shovel and digs one more hole under the boat of sam. This probably saved his life. A must read!!!!
4,Ashley 's Book Review,"Stanley Yelnats was overweight when he was younger, he'd pretend he went to camp like the other rich kids. He was born in a poor family. Stanley Was always in the wrong place at the wrong time, and bad things happened. Thanks to his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather, he had a choice to go to jail or camp green lake, to dig holes because it is told to be said that if you take a bad boy and make him dig a hole everyday in the hot sun it will turn him into a good boy well stanley yelnats is under a curse which started wiht his great great grandfather.They dig to find thing under the lake."
3,Hole review,thear was a great grandfather who made the family have a curse for not taking the pig up the hill. syanley haD TO GO TO camp greeen lake because he was acused for stealing shoes and he metsome friends and one of them was zero. He RAN AWAY Once and stanley went to find him and he found him under a ship. So he went back to camp green lake and they got realaesed and the curse was broken.
4,The book was ok,"When Stanley found a pair of shoes that fell from the sky he was put in Camp Green Lake.Stanley blamed it on his no good rotten pig stealing great great grandfather, who was cursed because he didn't caryy madame zeroni up the mountain. I don't want to ruin trhe book so figuire it out yourself"
4,Holes,"Holes is an interesting book. It teaches lessons about friendship. It's really wierd how it turns out in the end, I would definitely recommend it. Im not gonna tell u anymore. I think u should open up the book, and FIND OUT! :)"
5,What a great book (for everyone)!,"This may be a Newbury Award winner for children's literature, but I'm 23 and it kept me interested and in suspense the whole time. The interlacing of the two stories, the present centering around Stanly and the past centering around the ""ancient"" Green Lake its seedy past, are perfect and masterful. The characters are simply done, but they have a massive dynamic, taking on a whole new life after ""building character."" It's a great adventure, a riveting drama, a raucous comedy and has one of the most satisfying and redeming endings I've read in any novel, current or classic. This is great for every reader of every age. I give it my highest recommendation possible!"
5,Holes is very cool,I think holes is the best and cool book and interesting and also a mystery.I recomend this book the best!You will love this bookand i give it 5 stars.There is a kid named Stantley Yeltnats and he is accused of steling some shoes. But when he goes to court they give him a choice go to Jail or Camp Green Lake what desicion do you think he is going to make?
3,Review on Holes,"I enjoyed reading Holes it was very interesting. I especially liked the flash backs in history. I think people who like adventure should read this book in they're spare time.I promise you ,you won't be disapointed.From a student."
5,holes,"What I like about holes is it has a little action and adventure and it's ok and I like the story it's mestirius and sad about Zero but a very happy ending.Almost all of my classmates liked it!!!Sincerely,Blank"
4,holes review by Hassan Musselmani,"I think that the book holes was a good book .Its setting is in texas at Camp Green Lake.The storie begins when some bad kids were sentenced to go to camp green lake to serve 18 months of labor work there.Once they got there,Mr.Sir who works for the warden Ms.Walker told the kids that they had to dig five feet wide and deep holes throughout the camp.The real reason for digging the holes was to find a buried treasure,but the kids were never told that.Throughout the storie these kids were digging more holes.At some point,two of the kids found the treasure and also found out that the suitcase full of money belonged to one of the kids great grandfather.The two kids were found innocent and they left the camp with one million dollars for each of them."
4,A must read!,If you are looking for a good adventure try Louis Sachar's book Holes. I liked this book because the pace made me keep on reading to find what happened to Stanley. Like when they dig holes for punishment and Stanley Yelnats teaches his friend Zero to read and write. Then Hector (Zero) digs some of Stanley's hole everyday. If you like digging holes try Holes.
5,HOLES...A Book I REALLY DIG!,"This was a really good book, very interesting, and i couldn't put it down! Wish it was availible on video...what other books would u reccomend if i loved this one?"
5,Great for book club discussions,"I recently read holes for a book club, the discussion was great we all had different ideas of what was going on, and the activities were great I highly recomend this book. It was much better then Sachar's other books!"
5,GREAT! I have 0 complaints,"This book was the best I've read all year.Louis Sachar(my favorite author)made it hilarious and interesting.Once I had started it,it was impossible to put down.I recommend this book highly."
4,Best book in ages!!!,This book was great in so many different ways. I also think it attracts such a veriety of ages. The plot was a little slow in the beggining but it wakes up a little in to the middle of the book.As I said it is the best book (not including Harry Potter of course) in ages.My hats of to Louis Sacher. It was really top draw.
4,Holes,"HolesStanley Yelnats is just a regular boy that gets framed about stealing shoes and gets asked by a judge if he would like to go to jail or to a summer camp. Thinking that the camp would be fun he chose to go to ""Camp Green Lake."" As he gets to the camp he meets many new kids that have done other crimes the first thing he says that no lake no green and notices that this will not be fun. The next day he has to dig a hole that is 5 feet deep and 5 feet wide he finds a fish fossil. Now its pretty hot out its 95 degrees in the shade but you really do not need to know that because the warden does not let anyone go in her shade. Finally after alot of days of hard working in the sun and so many days at camp Green Lake he gets to go home and they change Camp Green Lake to a good camp. See how it goes for Stanley and read about the new Camp Green Lake."
5,"""You're not in the Girls Scouts anymore""","Stanley Yelnats was in the wrong place at the wrong time. That was always the problem with the Yelnats family. Stanley was being sent to jail because he was accused of a crime that he did not committ. Unfortunately for Stanley it was either jail time, or Camp Green Lake. Luckily, Stanley had never been to Camp before, so this seemed like a wise alternative for him. When Stanley arrives at camp he encounters many people and places that will forever change his life. Stanley learns the true meaning of friendship and what loyalty truly means. Stanley realizes that receiving a nickname is a sign of respect, no matter how demeaning the nickname is. Holes is a heartwarming story of a young man coming to terms with responsibilty and self awareness. This is a heartwarming story that students and adults will equally enjoy."
5,Excellent Book,"I loved this book. It's about a boy named Stanley Yelnats, his last name is his frist, just backwards. Anyways, Stanley is cursed. It all started with his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing great-great grand father. Stanley gets blamed for something he did not do and is sent to Camp Greenlake for punishment. I would rate this book 5 stars because it's funny and a good book for children of all ages or even adults who are children at heart."
4,Mah review,"Holes was a story within a story within a story. I liked how Sachar left you hanging at the end....he kept you thinking. I also liked the quotes that he used some of them are, ""when i die who will dig my grave"", and ""every day i watched my parednts dig holes, when i got older i had to dig holes....even on Chritmas"". I liked Sachar style. I think that he writes about what he likes. In the beginning of the story he used a pig that Elya had to carry up the mountain and he used the name Elya, that is not a common name but to him he may like it.In Camp Greenlake there are groups D,E,and F.All the kids in group Dhave nicknames. Stanley is Caveman.What i didnt like in Holes was that he used the number 3 too much. He should have used other numbers instead of 3. Also the story got confusing at times, he kept going to one story to another and i counldn't tell which story was which. This is what i think about HOles"
2,A bean bag of a book,"I did not like Holes.Louis Sachar moved around too much for me. The whole idea of a story within a story within a story was a great idea, but threw me around too much. I felt like a bean bag being tossed around. I think that if Louis Sachar wanted to write a story it should have been based on one main story. Holes kind of dragged on longer than it should have. By the end of the book I was relieved to have finally summed up the story. I think the story gave a lot of suspense so I was ready to reach the end to conclude the story. I would rate this story a 2."
4,holes,The book is called holes it is I an interesting book to read. It's about this kid named Stanley yelnats. He goes to this camp called camp green lakes because he stole a pair of sneakers. That camp is all about diging a six foot hole In the hot heat.Stanley's family is under a curse because of his great great great uncle because he did not bring madam zaroni the mountain. So while Stanley was at camp him and zero and find a drink called glucose and then they get back to camp and then they both find treasure. Then they become rich off of gluse and that treasure they found. Zero finally finds his mother and they live happily ever after.This is a real good book to read it funny at some parts. It get's you wondering what going to happen next. It's a real good book you should try
5,'There is no lake at Camp Green Lake.',"I would recommend this book to anyone I know because it is one of the best books I've ever read. This is a really exciting book because every chapter something new and exciting happens that makes you want to read more. There were a lot of unexpected surprises in this book, one example of this is when Stanley is falsely accused of stealing some shoes from a famous baseball player and it turns out Stanley's friend Hector, also known a Zero, stole the shoes. I would recommend this book to anyone because it's a really great book and I think boys, girls, adults and children would enjoy this book. I hope everyone will read this fantastic book and like it just as much as I do."
5,EVEN BETTER THAN HARRY POTTER?,"I read about 20 books out loud to my kids every year, and this one is my favorite from the past year. Fascinating characters and amazing coincidences made this a page-turner. The kids begged me to keep reading until my voice was hoarse!"
4,Holes,I read Holes by Louis Sacher and I loved it. I really loved how the book was so detailed on the characters emotions. It was so understandable what the charcaters had to go through.
5,A Must - Read For Book Groups,"This is a must read for anyone,especially book groups. There are many hidden secerets and confusing little tid bits that you might not understand unless you talk about it with someone else who has read it too.This is a great book to read on a rainy day when you have nothing to do because you probably won't want to put it down!"
4,Need A Lift?,"Any one needing a spirtual lift and feels that nothing in their life can go right and that they have the worst life in the world needs to read this book. This book is about a young boy who is sent to a ""camp"" and instead is expected to dig a hole as long, wide, and deep as his shovle every day in the blazing hot sun!"
4,Holes book review,"The book is written buy Louses Sachar. When saw the front cover I thought it was about a lizards.The book is about a boy called Stanley Yelnats and Hector Zaroney that got sent to CAMP GREEN LAKE for steeling a pear of trainers.I like the part when Stanley stole the water truck and drove it into a hole.The part I hated was when they went to the olden days at CAMP GREEN LAKEWhen there was a lake it was to long.The main characters WERE : STANEY ZERO , XRAY, ARMPIT , MAGENT ZIGZAG , TICH , MR.SIR ,WARDEN,AND DR.PANDENSKIThe character I like is zero coss he was ferry small and can't read but Stanley helped him but he new his maths good and he was a ferry nice character .The character I didn't like was dr.pandenski coss he was a noiseCoss he got in to so many peoples business and he said that there life is bad.I would recommend holes to friends coss its a good book to read coss if u like a book that goes fast I say read this book ."
4,holes,"HOLES++Louis SacharI like the look of it but I think it was all about lizards.The story start when Stanley has been guilty about taking clydev livingstons trainer.Stanley had a choices to go to jail or go camp green lake.So Stanley go camp green in the middle on the deserts with no water in the lake.A man name mr sir how eaten sunflower seed because he trying to stop smoking.Stanley help xroe though the deserts by eating onions and fining water.the part I like best was when stanley and zero fined the suitcase and it was in stanley name .also zero went home with stanley and stanley lawyer. Stanlyhelp zero find his mum.The main people is Stanley ,zero ,mr sir"
2,SCARY SCARY SCARY GROSS MEAN STRANGE SCARY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"don't read this the book is gross scary and NOT FUNNY! boys dig holes, are mistreated, and fight . why does my teacher like it???????? don't ever read this!!! read warrior cats the best series in the WORLD !!!!!!?!!!"
2,Don't care for it.,"This book HOLES by louis sachar is kind of a boring story in my opinion. I haven't read it in a long time so maybe I forgot it. But, what I CAN remember is that a guy named Stanley has to dig REALLY deep holes in a camp. (it's not even a real camp.) Therefore, the words the author uses to describe the characters looks, actions and supplies freek me out. In conclusion this book is not up to my needs so it could havebeen a lot better."
4,Holes,"The book name is `Holes', and author is Louis Sachar.This book is about Stanley who digs a hole all day long in Camp Green Lake. Camp Green Lake is dry and flat wasteland, no rain and there is only a sun in the sky. Stanley meets many friends in tent `D', but they are not really good friends exceptZero. Stanley teaches Zero how to read and write and they are getting closer to each other. Stanley and Zero are trying to find something; The Warden (Camp Green Lake Counselor) is trying to find that too.I like the part when Zero is choking x-Ray because that part is really funny. I don't like Kate and Sam's part because that part is boring.The main character is a boy named Stanley; he went to the camp green lake because he stole shoes.I recommend this book `Holes' because it is adventurous and this book tells many things about friend ship."
2,Holes,This book stinks. I hate it how it goes to two different storys.I hate the characters and the setting. It had a bad story line.That is why I give it a 2.THIS BOOK STINKS
2,Buried Onions,I did not like this book. I thought it was ridiculous and very unpleasent to read. I gave it two stars because it was a boring book.
5,A book that must be read,"An absolutely incredible book for young readers, Holes tells an amazingly entertaining tale that shouldn't be missed.The main story follows Stanley Yelnats who is wrongly accused of a crime and sent to a camp along with other juveline deliquents to dig holes under the merciless blaze of the sun... what happens next I won't say so I don't spoil the plot, but what unfolds makes this a great book to read, one that as I've said before, you want your child to miss."
4,Why this book inspired me,I love this book beacause thier is alot of Intelletual persaverance.I think that Stanley never gave up on diging holes with the hot sun out.I also think that their is Intelletual Curiosity beacause Stanley was very curios about why he had to dig holes.Another thing is that this book is very curios because it sounds like it's a real story.A last thing would be it's a really great book for all ages.
5,One of the best books I've ever read.,This book is very imaginative in a real life sort of way.It was simply wonderful.
5,This book is an excellent book!!!!!!,The book is about a boy that gets taught a lesson. I truly think this is the best book EVER!!!!! He was sent to a dried up lake and had to dig holes for commiting a crime which he really didn't do!!!!!!
5,great social commentary,"this book is not just for kids...there are a lot of adults out there who would benefit from reading this, specifically certain uninspiring teachers i had in high school. this book illustrates not only what is wrong with the way we punish our youth but also what is wrong with how we educate them. this book would make a great film, too bad kubrick passed away--the landscapes and subject matter of this book fit squarely within many of the parameters of his directorial preferences. a five star book."
4,The Best Part of Holes,"You may not know it, but Holes was one of children's most favorable book according to the Sunday Paper book review. Holes is about a boy named Stanley Yelnats who is accused of commiting a crime. He is sent to a camp where the warden makes the bays dig holes. The warden is in search of a particular item. This is Stanley's punishment. If you like adventure books and Louis Sachar's books, you will love reading this. This is a book that will take you on an unforgettable adventure. Recommended for ages 9 & up."
3,Beware of lynch mob killing and torture of lady outlaw.,"SPOILER ALERT. Wow. Just finished reading this engrossing fairy tale. I was totally unprepared for the lynch mob killing of sweet Sam for kissing a white girl, and the gruesome death of Kate Barlow who was tortured ""until her feet were black and blistered"" and whacked with a shovel whenever she stopped walking. Although I enjoyed the characters, their development, and the creative intertwining story lines, the dark undertones of child enslavement and malicious adult oppressors (who don't mind children dying) are very disturbing. I can't believe I almost read this to my 3rd grader! Definitely not recommended for young children. A middle or high schooler or adult would better appreciate the dark humor of this story."
5,Holes,Holes is a good book . It is the best. If you start reading you must finish it. The author of the book is Louis Sachar.Ithink this book was the best . Read Holes it is the best!
5,Holes [Bad boys become good],"Holes my favorate book good for people who like adventure.Is about a boy named Stanley Yelnats. He's a good kid but his luck makes him a bad kid.One day out of nowhere shoes come falling through the sky.He takes them and later gets arrested for stealing a famous ball player's shoes.He has a choice to go to jail or anyones worst nightmare Camp Green Lake.How was he soppose to know he picked a bad choice? When Stanley finally arrives at Camp Green Lake he finds out what a nightmare's like.Digging holes five feet wide and five feet long.After this it starts to get exciting!You probably have an idea of how popular it is from my point of view it's perfect.But also it teaches you a lesson like anything can happen when Stanley reaches terrible fates.For exaple,when he thinks nothing is going right he goes on a mountain called God's Thumb and finds onions and some water. Believe me thats important in this story. This is a book I recomend!"
4,Wow.,"I thought this was a really thought-provoking book. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it could have been a little more descriptive, and at some points, the plot fell together just a little too neatly.Otherwise, though, it's very interesting. Stanley Yelnats must go to a detention camp to serve a punishment for a crime he didn't commit. He must endure the idiosyncracies of his fellow ""campers"" and wardens in order that he may survive. But most importantly (in my humble opinion) he forges a friendship with ""Zero,"" a camper who has never been or done anything worthy or useful - at least to ordinary observers.This is a beautiful tale of human frailty, prejudice, friendship, trust and of promises broken and redeemed. Definitely worth a read, no matter what your age (I am 23)."
3,Holes Critique,This story talks about these Stanley And his adventures at Camp Green lake. I've never read any story like it before. I like how the author makes you imagise how hot it is and how Stanley and the boys at Camp Green lake must feel. Louis Sacharpahts a good picture...
4,It was an interesting book.,"I like the friendship betwen Stanley and Zero because you can see how strong a relacionship can be betwen two people when they relaize that they are alone and they need to trust in each other. I didn't like the warden because she is a cold person who dosen't care about anybody else but herself and she is greedy, however I think that she's a good caracter for the book because she plays an important role in the plot."
5,Great read!!!,"This is one of my favorite books...ever. I have read it aloud 5 or 6 times and still love it myself. My students as young as third graders just eat it up! It has so many relevant issues and sparkles with humor. Be sure to have a ""sploosh"" party at the end - peach milkshakes :) Enjoy the read and the treats!"
5,Really Good Book!,"The book Holes by Louis Sachar is about a boy who is accused of a crime, sent to a camp, and goes on a big journey. This boy's name is Stanley Yelnats. Stanley is accused of stealing a famous athlete's shoes.After the court rules him guilty he is sent to a camp for ""bad boys."" This is called Camp Green Lake. Even though the lake is dried up, there is still a reason why people are there. That is to dig holes.Thae Warden, who is in charge of the camp, is looking for something. In order to find it, she makes boys, who have done something wrong, dig for it. This benefits the Warden, and punishes the ""bad boys."" When Stanley's friend runs away from the camp,Satnley follows him. After a wild adventure they make it to a mountain with a ""big thumb"" on top. From there it is life or death.by:Molly D."
5,The meanest campo,"Have you ever been sent to bootcamp or got grounded ? Cause you will want to read holes. A boy who got grounded and got sent to pay what he has done ,to dig holes.You should read holes an intersting."
3,Good book--monotone narrator,"This is only a review of the audio CD. The book is good but the narrator chosen for the audio (although an actor) is just way too monotone. I used this for a class of 5th/6th graders and it became a running joke among the students to talk in a monotone, expressionless voice in imitation. Just my class's opinion! Others may like it."
4,It was a inspirational book which depicts bravery...,"This book is about a hard-working and most unlucky boy who gets stuck into a boy's juvinile camp due to some misunderstandings and miscarriages of the law. His name is Stanley Yelnats. Same spelled forwards as backwards. He is in the camp to dig for some treasures of his past anscestors, and hopefully to get rid of his bad luck streak."
5,Best book that I have read,"Defenitly one of my favorite top ten books. Take it from a ten year old, you won't be able to put it down if you read it."
4,Holes,"Holes is a great book. It is about a boy named Stanley Yelnats. He is accused of stealing a pair of tennis shoes.Then he is sent to a camp called Camp Greenlake. As he is at the camp the other campers and himself have to dig holes to find treasure for the warden. At the camp he makes friends and has bad experiences. To find out what else happens to Stanley Yelnats your going to have to read the book.Overall I would say that this book has a good plot. I would read this book if you like other books from Louis Sachar. Also, I would read this book if you like books with suspense and action.By, Eric B."
1,Not as good as everyone said,"""You HAVE to read this!"", or, ""You can't put it down it is so good!"". These were the quotes of my friends that were said to me. Those quotes won't be repeated by me. Ok, I'm a teenager, and this was supposed to be the best book of the year! All it was about was this Stanley guy who dug holes as a punishment for stealing a pair of famous shoes! I mean come on! Then, he see's this mountain shaped like a thumbs up and it inspired him! Geez! I had to write a book report on the lame book, and I had to draw what I thought the cover would be. I just drew a boy who dug holes, and mountains in the backround. It said it all! And even more, my teacher agreed! I was also very astonished that it has recieved the Newbery Award! I hope that the judges won't pick something as bad next year to be the prized book of the year! So in conclusion, I am immediatly switching over to Harry Potter for real reading enjoyment!P.S.- Two Thumbs DOWN!"
1,?????,"This was the stupides book I have ever read its about a dumb boy digging holes,""HOW EXCITING!!"" We all want to read that....sure.. this was a far by worse book Louis (Sacher) HAS EVER WRITTEN.even Wayside School Arrithmitic,Sixth Grade Secerts, and Theres a girl in the boys bathroom ,or what ever, is better than this. YUCK"
2,Disappointed,"The book was listed as ""great condition."" When I received it, there was a name whited out on the spine, several pen and pencil notes on the inside pages. I was very disappointed!"
4,A great book for all ages !,The book was excellent. I recommend it for ages ten and over.It all folds out at the end.I give it four stars. It's really funny.
5,"Good read for children, holds a special place for me.","As the title says, this book holds a special place for me in my life. I read it when I was in the fifth grade for school. Every night me and my mom would read before bed, taking turns reading pages and paragraphs. This book was also significant because at this time it was the highest reading level I remember reading on my own. All that aside I think it is a good read for children and a great story. Depicting a young man who is cursed by a long family tradition that ends up in a work camp for troubled youth by mistake. The work camp makes the residents dig a single hole every day to ""build character"", but as the story unravels it turns out there is alternative motives to have the boys dig holes. Throughout a series of flashbacks to the beginning of the family curse the author keeps children interested, until Stanley lifts the curse with his new found friend, and returns home. A must read for children around the 5th or 6th grade."
4,No Holes Here,The details fill 'em in even though it ends quickly. It's an easy read and a good one to share with your child or his book club. Hi Ellen.
5,HOLES,"WAS TOLD BY FRIENDS THIS WAS REQUIRED READING IN MIDDLE SCHOOL,NEVER HEARD OF THE BOOK ,SO I HAD TO READ IT,,KEPT ME INTERESTED AND IN SOME PARTS I DID JUMP.I ENJOY BOOKS THAT YOU GETS YOU SO INVOLVED THAT YOU DO NOT WANT TO STOP READING UNTIL IT IS DONE,,SO VERY GLAD I READ IT.."
4,Good read,Of course if you have seen the movie first like I have its very different. Still a good read and still a good movie. I recommend this book.
2,Holes,Didn't really enjoy it that much it wasn't very exciting at all of what I thought about it but not too bad.
4,Holes,I think you should read this book because it was adventuring and sometimes you were like what's going to happen next.
5,this book is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this book is about a kid that is accused of stealing a famous baseball players shoes and has to go to jail or camp green lake as punishment.his parents chose camp green lake.everyday he has to dig a hole thats 5' deep and 5' in width all the way around.after that he can shower then go to the wreck room which is a wreck!!! everything is broken! wanna know if he survives? THEN READ THE BOOK! this book is so good i read it in les than a day and a quarter!
5,FANTASIC BOOK,"Review Author: Louis SacharBy:Ashley WhiteThe amazing book that I'm reading is named Holes. This fun book isabout a teenager named Stanley Yelnants.He was innocent when hehad to go to court for being convicted for stealing shoes. So he hada choice to either go to jail or a juevenile prison.They had to dig holesall day every day. But Stanley knows what they are digging for. Theyare all digging for a treasure.A treasure that Stanley's no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing great grandfather stole. Also Stanley is under aa curse. Another thing is that Stanley meets alot of unfriendly peoplethat he doesn't get along with. Like three boys nick named Shadow,Zig Zag, and Armpit.Another boy he meets is Zero.People that areat the Camp Green Lake detention center are very mean to him. ButStanley is the only one tha talks to Zero. Well he talks to him everyonce in a while. Then they become best friends at the camp."
1,Good Book,"This book is the opposite of the book Harry Potter, it is a VERY GOOD book. READ IT READ IT READ IT.YOU REALLY SHOULD!"
2,Don't Waste Your Time On The Book,"The book was okay, but very badly written. I somewhat enjoyed the book as I was reading it, but afterwards I thought ""Why did I read this?"" For young readers, I reccomend more INTELLIGENT reading. Not books about some treasure that you KNOW the good guy is going to win. Watch the movie, instead, which is in theaters now. It is a lot better than the book. The book is also unrealistic. How can someone live off of peaches that have been sitting in a boat for one hundred years and only just barf? Wouldn't it be a lot more serious? And American justice is much better than that stated. Camp Greenlake would never exist in this country. I felt that I was reading a book that happened in a foreign Communist movie. So if you're going to waste [money] plus shipping on your book ..., don't! Waste that same amout of money for a movie ticket. I seriously say that the movie is better than the book."
1,DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!!!,DO NOT SPEND ANY TIME READING THIS BOOK. IT IS NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE. I FOUND MYSELF FALLING ASLEEP READING THIS BOOK. I GIVE IT ONE STAR FOR TRYING!
1,Just Plane Awful !,"Ugh! This book was awful. I mean I loved Harry Potter books but I hate this book. It was ok, I guess but all it was about was a kid going to a camp and having to dig a hole every day.If your looking for a nice long book do not get this one it only took me 2 days to read."
1,HOW DIM WITTED CAN YOU BE?,"SEND A KID TO THE DESERT TO DIG HOLES FIVE FEET WIDE BY FIVE FEET DEEP? DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY? WHO'S GOING TO BELIEVE THIS? ALRIGHT, MAYBE AFTER HARRY POTTER WE COULD BELIEVE THIS FANTASY BUT REALLY...WHATEVER HAPPENED TO REAL BOOKS?"
2,An Okay Book,"This is an OK book, but the book about Harry Potter, a leading member of our community here at Hogwarts, is much better. Buy Harry Potter! He needs to get rich! RICH! RICHRICH!"
5,Excellent for young readers!,"This book is great. It's funny, suspensful, and something I would definitely add to my library. I especially love the happy ending!"
4,Great book,I read this book and it is one of the best I have ever read. If your not sure about getting it get it because it is hillarious.
4,Holes -Kaleb great book,"Would you like a mystery or an adventure book? Then you would like to read the book, Holes. It's about a teenage boy who was sent to a camp in the middle of a desert when he was accused of stealing a NBA players shoes. The boys name is Stanley, and whoever was at the camp was forced to dig a hole 5ft. wide, and 5ft. deep. If you would like to know why they're digging holes, then read Holes. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure and mystery."
5,Dominique's holes review,"I thought holes was a really great book because, it had a lot of details about the story and it gave you alot of info on the Stanley Yelnants 1 2 3 and so on.My favorite character of the book was Mr. Pendanski becuase, at the begining of the story you think he is such a good person becuase thy call him mom but he turn to a diffrent person like he told zigzag to hit stanley.my favorite part of the book was when Zigzag AND Stanley got into a fight about the ""cookie"" that was funny.My favorite line of the book was ""You ain't in girl scouts any more"".The book was really good thjats all I have to say about the holes book."
3,"Holes, a Book","I thought the book Holes was pretty good. I thought it was good because the story within a story within a story was cool how it came out in the end. But at the end Louis Sachar didn't tell me enough. My favorite character is Zero because he is funny, the way he talks and sounds. There are many interesting characters in the book Holes, like Myra Menke whose head is as empty as a flower pot and the one-legged gypsy,Madame Zeroni. Also there is Sam the Onion Man and Kissin Kate Barlow. My favorite line is when something gos wrong Stanley blames it on his ""no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather."" Holes is a book of secrets so you are in for a doozy. Holes was one of my favorite books so I hope you will enjoy as much as I did.By: Micheal ZanMinBow"
3,Read This To Find Out All The Info About Holes!,"The book Holes was a very well made book. A story within a story within a story is what the whole book is about. I really liked how Sachar put so many stories into one book, which in the end came together. The actual plot I felt could have been better because the story was really strange and weird-- you'll see why when you read it. Later on, you'll meet a one legged Gypsy and many secrets will be revealed."
3,Ü<¿>wHo dAt<¿>Ü,I think Holes was a great book because it's a story within a story within a story.Another thing I like about Holes is we never found out what happened in the end.And I like that Stanley blamed everything on his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather.
4,Why you should read Holes!,"Holes was a great book. It was so exciting and interesting. Some strong points are that the things from Elya's world come into Kate's world and then to Stanley's world. The book had various cliff hangers which made it interesting and fun to read. There are lots of fun names for characters, like Barfbag. So thats why I think you should read Holes."
4,Holes,"I gave this book four stars because, it was an interesting and fun to read. It is about a kid who was falsely accused and punished for a crime that he did not commit. He learns valuable lessons at a camp for troubled boys. I would recomend this book to almost anyone. It was an exeptional book."
4,KG's Holes Review,"Holes is a good book. I like how u write your KB signs. I like the yellow spotted lizards. I would like to know what God's Thumb is to u. And u have a crazy imagination because of your characters names,like Zero and X-ray."
5,Awesome,"My sister in law purchased this book for my boy. He read the book and said it was great.So,I read it.Since then,I have had several people read Holes.They have all loved this book."
3,A worthy read,"When I read Holes I wasn't disappointed. This book has two stories in one. The first story is the story of Stanley Yelnats, a boy who has been convicted of a crime he didn't commit, and his troubles in a dicipline camp where he has to dig a 5 foot hole daily. No one knows why they dig. They just do. The second story is aboout the history of the camp and the town around it. Many of the main character's ancestors are in it.The two stories have mysteries which tie into each other by the end and have an unexpected twist ending. Overall, this book is a good find, but not worth going out of you mind trying to find it, unless you are a huge fan of mysteries."
5,One of the best books I have ever read!!!!!,"Holes is a great book for young readers to read. It helps young children realize that even if someone is picking on you, violence is not the answer!Stanley was a very live character. So were the others but Stanley seemed like that average every day kid. This book really brought to life all the characters.This book kept me interested and I could not put it down!!!!Every chapter was filled with new surprises!!!"
3,Holes,This book is about a boy who just ran into some pretty bad luck.He was accused of doing something bad and is in juninile camp and has to dig holes for what he did to pay his crime for what he did or did he? I would give this book 3 stars because I love adventrous book and it was fun to read because of the new people he met and what there names are. And there plans to get out of the camp.
5,Brilliant!!Awesome!!!!,I couldn't put it down! It is very well writen. Wildly Inventive! I've always wanted to dig a big hole but not after reading this. Great! -Andrew
4,One of Sachar's best!,"Louis Sacher os known for hios witty and glamourous books,but this is his best yet! The characters are developed with ease, and the plot is amazing! Don't hesitate to read! This is a page turner!"
5,A Great Read,"Holes keeps you interested all the way through, much like The Adventures Of Archie Reynolds and the classic Treasure Island. It's not quite as action oriented as those books, but it's still a great read. I strongly recommend it."
3,Holes,"hears some names for holes mr.sur, mr.pidinsky. Stanily,zero,armpit. Staniy got arested for not even steling shoes sombady stol them and theur them. Zero dident no how to read or write so stanily shoued him how to read and write. he got better and better at it. I think that you should read this book it is a really good book."
5,Holes,I like the book holes. It is very exciting. It has lots of adventure. I would give it five stars. I would recamend it.It has lots of funny moments. I read it twice. It was a great book.
5,Stanley Yelnats' Story,"""Holes"" is a novel aimed at the 10-through 12 year-old reader. It concerns Stanley Yelnats, a sad-sack teen who gets sent to a youth camp for supposedly stealing a pair of sneakers. The camp is in the middle of a desert, and the daily routine for the inmates consists of digging a five foot deep hole in the hard, dry earth. The mysterious warden believes a treasure was buried there and wants the boys to find it for her.Stanley slowly adjusts to the rigors of daily digging and makes friends with his campmates - a motley assortment of delinquents that includes ""Zero,"" who wants to learn to read and write.This is an entertaining story. The author is a man of very few words, and I found the book less enjoyable than the film version, but several 12 year-olds have told me they loved the book."
2,Bobs point of veiw of Holes,"The book to me was ok.The book wasn't as good as I exspected it to be.I thought of it as all they did was dig holes.I didn't like the way Sacher left me hanging. The story of Holes had good excitement""sometimes"".The auther made you think. I like books that tell you at the end what happens to the character in the story. I like detailed books.I would have liked the story better if the 3 storys were in there own part of the book. I think if Sacher stuck to 1 story me and my mommy would like it better. The story other than that was ok."
5,Engrossing for all ages,I read this book to my 12 year old in yet another attempt at persuading him that books can be as good as video games. We both looked forward to his bedtime so that we could get another installment.
5,Never Stopped Reading,"Man, I've read many exciting books, but none like this one! Holes is a great book for children who love adventure, exciting, and funny stories. Its almost like it glues your eyes to the book. Many kids will not stop reading this book.... I recommend this book for all readers that want to read an awesome book..."
4,A fun read,"This book is what my mom called a ""sick book""--that is, a book that can be read easily in one day, that does not have a plot that is so complex it can't be understood when one is home sick in bed. Indeed, I read it recently while having a bout of the flu. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and it kept my thoughts away from my misery.I won't describe the plot in detail here, other than to say that it was fascinating, the characters were interesting, and the puzzle kept me intrigued. Yes, it's a bit surreal, but that is part of its charm. It definitely has a moral, also. I wouldn't get this book for a very young child; I wouldn't want them to take it too seriously, but certainly for an 8+ year old, try it!"
5,Bizarre and complex plot--loved it!,"""Holes"" is one of those books that either you love or you hate; I loved it. The premise is so surreal that you can almost believe it--that Stanley, who had a horrible run of bad luck, should be sent to the strangest detention center ever, banished to dig holes every day.The plot pulls the reader along, leading you through the bizarre landscape and turns of events, along with a parallel plot that takes place many years earlier in the same place. It is some time before you begin to discern how these plots will dovetail, but dovetail they do, and it impels you to read on and see how it all works out for Stanley.The plot is almost like a modern morality play, and the characters are so well drawn, that you become engaged with them all, the good and the bad. If you are a reader who loves what my colleagues and I refer to as ""weird"" books, this will be a great read. I have used it successfully as a read aloud with 6th graders, and they loved it, too."
3,HOLES,Holes is a great book because its a verry fun story because it teaches you about stealing and punishes and that you can't live with out water or food.
4,Fun but exciting,"When I read the book Holes in the 7th grade I thought it was a good book. It wasn't hard to read and it wasn't easy, it was a book that made me laugh and enjoyed reading it and it had alot of characters that had many different personalities. At first I thought the book was to long because I didn't want to read a book over 100 pages because I never wanted to read. Also the book kept me waiting for the next thing to happen because I was so into the book and never wanted to stop reading it when i started.Now, I still think the book is great and now that I read again I got the same feeling when I read it the first time. I also still think that the book is adventurous and fun to read. Even though I am older and are on a higher reading level I still think the book is great. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a fun and exciting book."
5,Amazing!,"This book seemed like it was set in a totally different world,although it wasn't.Highly recommended!!!!!!!"
5,DIG THIS BOOK,"The book holes is a good and sad story . And i think this is good to read over and over again. My favorite part was when they were back at the camp and found the tresure. And the least favorite part is when zero was stuck in the desert. This book was about this boy got sent to a camp. I would recommend this book to a friend because its a fun novel to read . The most intresting themes was when they found the tresure and when it finally rain at the camp.Thing , that i would change would be when stanley took the truck and drive it in a hole. The thing i would put is when he stole it and he made it to zero."
5,THE BEST BOOK IN THE WORLD,This book is about stanley yelnats. He went to camp green lakes.Because Clyde Lingston shoes hit Stanley out of no were.Stanley went to cort pick camp cause Sanley never been to camp.Camp Green lake was one of the biges lake in teaxs nowit's just a big dry land so the kids dig in the hot sun 5 feet deep and 5 feet wide one hole a day it's for bad boy'sto be good. you can buy the book and find out what els is in the book holes you well love it I did.this book change my way's.
5,READ THIS BOOK !,I like this book is good because it is about a kid name stanley yelnats and he and his family is under a curse. Then he is going to a boys detenion center to build their character but the warden is looking for something not to build character for the boys. My favorite part was when zero hit mr.pendensky across his face with the shovel and the warden slaping mr.sir's face with her painted snake venom on her nails. I think other people should read this book and tell their friends cause if you read the book all the way then you can tell that this book is a good to read over and over . If you like this book then you know how the story goes so i am telling to you read that this book cause it is very good to read to your class and to yourself.
2,Not what I expected,"I received the item in a timely manner, however, the book had writing inside and it did not have the same coveras advertised. The book was an older hardback blue version of Holes. I ended up buying another book locally."
3,HOLES,Our opinion about this book would be that it was a good book and it was an interesting book to read. Reading this book about HOLES was a good experience for our class. The book holes really kept our class busy cause we would spend most of the time reading and we would take quizes and we had 2 use our melons to figure out the questions.We hope that in the future we will have the opportunity to read this book again. were done!!!!!!!!!!!!!by: Tristan and Janice
1,HARRY POTTER WAY BETTER,This book is weird.Whoever thinks it is better than Harry potter is a weirdo.J.K. RULES (no offense Louis)
1,bad,i thought this book was a very bad book. it was so stupid that i fell asleep in the part when he was talking to the guard about he can run when ever he wants and the guard can't stop him.
1,Holes,"HOLES IS THE WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!I am a student at Waldron Mercy Academy (ACLJ). This book is about a boy called Stanley Yelnats who goes to a boot camp called Camp Green Lake. This boy got sent to this boot camp because he stole a famous baseball player's shoe. There was 5 tents(A,B,C,D,E) and no lake. Stanley was sent to tent D. At their tent the kids had nicknames. His nickname was Caveman. They had a conselor named Mom. And a boy named Zero. Now I tell you their punishments. They dug holes 5 feet deep, 5 feet long. There was another story about Stanley's rotten,pig-stealing,no good grandfather. He wanted to marry a women. So he stole Madame Zeroni's pig but the other guy got a fatter pig and married the women. But Stanley finds out that Zero's real name is Hector Zeroni. And then the boot camp shuts down and Hector goes home with Stanley. Even though it sound like I liked the book I really hated it."
5,Awesome,**Reviewed by my 9 yr old son** This book is simply awesome and the best book I have read. I think everyone who loves to read should read this awesome book.
5,Fifth Grade Teacher Speaks Out!,This book is wonderful. I teach fifth grade so I read a ton of chlidren's books. Holes is a true gem!
4,This book is good but not good enough for a historious novel,"If you would live a day in the life of Stanley Yelnats shoes you would know what it would be like to live life from every aspect of view. Stanley has been made fun of, convicted, and been a hero in this story. But I am not going to tell you all the aspects of the story so you will just have to read it for yourself if you want some astonishment action packed drama."
1,good book,i like cheese and rice oh my gosh snakes is not fun suck on ice chips and put the banana in the peel...
1,Even in a serious situation Stanley makes you laugh,"This is one book everyone enjoys, adults and children as young as 7. I read it in a day and then started reading it to my second grade class. They always asked that I read more. The story helps children with listening skills, sequence and looking for clues. Not to mention how the book keeps them interested. Each time I read it to a group of second graders I get a new perspective on the story."
1,The worst book I have ever read,"I was amazed at how bad this book was. It is about a kid who steels some famous guys shoes and has to go to boot camp and dig holes. That's 100 or so pages of him and some other criminals digging holes. There is also a secondary story about his grandfather stealing a pig. What I don't understand is how anyone could possibly like this book. I'm assuming the holes have some symbolic meaning, but I can't understand what it could be. I guess ther're emotional holes... Anyway, this is the worst book I have ever read and I suggest that if you must read it, take it out from the library. It's not worth your money!"
2,The Descriptive Terror,"This book was an easy reader. Too many used up, worn out words. There are also the classic ""Thought to be dumb"" characters that are really smart. The tense moments really get to you. I didn't really like the way they told two stories at once, because you forget about one story for a time, then you forget about the other one. I only like the descriptions."
1,Not what I thought it might be.,"The story is about a kid who gets sent to court and then out to a boys camp for a crime he did not do(stealing a pear of shoes). He meets some kids out there, becomes bubbies with them, and near the end makes a break for home with one of them named zero.Being a fan of jail break stories, the book sounded pretty good.Boy, was I wrong about that.The story was totally unbeliveable, is over done, and makes no scence at all. I should have thought more about what I was getting into. I could see where a little kid would like this, or someone who dose not think about the realism of what there reading. This book had lots of holes in it."
5,"Imaginative Fiction that ""Builds Character"" (:","This is not a book for young children, but it is a wonderful book to share with a child 9 and up (tween-aged). My 9 year old adores it and has now also watched the movie. She wants to read the book again now, to compare the two. We read it, taking turns, aloud in the car on a road trip. I could talk to her about things like why the boys in the book are in a juvi-type camp, what is okay and not okay, and also about the heartbreaking situations that arise from the romance in the story....but a child 8-9 and up should be able to read and understand this book--and enjoy it. I'm looking for more Sachar books to buy, tonight."
4,A clever story,"I like the way the author goes from the present to the past. I also like that although it is a realistic novel, is and a novel foul of fantasy"
4,Holes is a very interesting book.,I loved this book! I figured out every secret in it. I love books that you have to figure out things. Zero was my favorite character. He was so interesting. I have listened to the audio tape at least 49 times! Just one questionwhy did the warden scratch Mr. Sir?
4,Holes,"Knowing that you were innocence for a crime that that was done doesn&#65533;t always mean your innocence. Well Stanley Yelnats knew better when a pair of shoes literally fell on his head. After he was convicted of stealing a pair of shoes that belong to Clyde Livingston all just went downhill from there, thanks to his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing great grandfather. As for Stanley, the judge gave him a choice of either going to Jail or CAMP GREEN LAKE, a place that is beyond nightmare and hell combined. When Stanley arrived he wondered why are there many holes? As he met Mr. Sir he was told that all the boys are building character from digging holes but like wise the kids weren&#65533;t digging to build character, but in fact they were digging for something else."
4,Awesome Book! You should read it.,"I didn't want to read it at first. After I read the first chapter I couldn't put it down. It was a great book. I love it. It was full of action and I think it is for all ages. You should read it. For a person who doesn't like to read, you would love this."
5,Holes was great!!,I thought that holes was a great book!! it had a ton of imagination and was very interesting. i couldn't put it down. I especially liked the stories about his no-good-rotten-pig-steeling-great-grandfather. I reccomen reading this great book.
5,Holes,"The book of Holes is very good. Let me tell you what it is all about. The book is about a boy named Stanley. He is about 13 years old and he goes to a place named Camp Green Lake. It is a place where boys go when they did something wrong.Well while he is there is because of his no good dirty rotten great great grandfather. Shoes fell out of the air. Well when he went to court they asked him if he wanted to go to jall or camp, and Stanley thought that this would be a fun camp. To his surprise it was not that fun for Stanley. If you read the book I bet you will understand what I mean.I really recommend this book to all people who like funny and mystery books."
5,Wholes Review by: You'll never know!!!,"I thought that Holes was a very good book. Once you thought you knew what was gonna happen next, it rolls off course leaving you to a fresh new start. You'll find surprises in every page and during the way, Stanley is off to fulfill his quest. A quest that clings onto him, destined for him to accomplish it. You may find more than one quest thoughout the book while Stanley takes you to a exiting adventure filled with happy moments, misery, and danger. One thing you'll ponder is: Is it coincidence or destiny? Maybe it was destiny that Stanley was sent to a camp of bad boys for being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Or was it?"
4,Camp Green Lake,"Holes is a very neat story.Louis Sachar writes fun stories like Holes. Stanley Yelnats is a character that has to go to Camp Green Lake... you find out the reason.When Stanley goes to camp Green Lake, he meets some kids. They have very unusual names. ""Camp Green Lake is not a girl scout camp,"" Mr.Sir would say.In Holes, when you start to read about the warden... you would never guess he or she was.I thought the book Holes was a book that had a good meaning. I would give this a four star rating for the book. I think if you read Holes you would like it.If you read Holes I hope you will enjoy it!"
5,You think your review is good-- try mine!!!,"So ya wonna read Holes huh? Well, it's an all around good book. It's a funny,easy read. You may think its a long book(with 233 pages)but it goes fast. When you're reading, you think you have uncovered a mystery but you read a little more(because you can't put it down)and you find out you're wrong!!! Once you have read this book you will see your life is sometimes the same as the characters' in the book(miserable or wonderful)! Thanks for reading! BillaBong Skatepark"
4,A really good read.,"When I first read a description of ""Holes"", I was immediately interested. I can definitely see why it received such a great honor, the Newbery Medal. ""Holes"" is the story of Stanley Yelnats IV (his name is a palindrome.) He is framed for a crime he did not commit, and chooses to go to a special camp for juveniles rather than to jail. (Stanley's family has had bad luck all the way back to Stanley Yelnats I, who broke a promise to a gypsy.) Camp Green Lake, however, is nothing like Stanley expects. As the author informs us on the first page, there is no lake at Camp Green Lake. It dried up years ago. The boys who live there are forced to dig a 5-foot hole every day. Sachar leaves ""holes"" in the story, jumping back and forth to different places and times, but they are filled in, and the secret of Camp Green Lake is finally revealed. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a little suspense and a lot of fun."
5,mtuqueen4ever,I really enjoyed holes.It was a really great book.It was about this boy name stanley yelnats who got in some trouble.He had to go to camp green lake but he really didnt do nothing.There at Camp Green Lake it was your worst nightmare because you had to dig holes.They had to be 5 feet deep and wide in like 100 degreeweather.i liked this book because i liked the characters they were cool and funny so thats why u sould go check it out!!!!
5,I Like To Dig HOLES.,"I think that holes was a really,really,really great book. I don't know what the big deal is about digging holes. I like to dig holes. My favorite part in the book was when Zero hit Mr. Sir or Mr.Pendanski in the face with a shovel. Now I thought that there was a lot of action in that chapter. Now I really thought it was a great book because it was really interesting. I also liked when someone was talking about Sam,Mary Lou,and the teacher but I can't remember her name and how she kissed Sam and they got caught and people saw them kissing and how the lake got dry right after Sam was killed. There hasn't been a rain drop ever since. I think if everybody reads this book i think they will really enjoy it as much as I did."
3,Holes,"This book is very long and superstitious. stanley has good luck and bad luck trought the book. The book has a bit of bening in the wrong place at the wrong time. this is a widely known superstion. Holes is a wonderful book written by Louis Sachar. it influences teamwork and trust.thought the book deals with superstition and luck, it still upholeds a level of reality. this ficion novel is very clever. it is obveous Sachar spent a long time writting it.it is no wonder it won the NewBerry Medal."
3,vivianna's review,I think the book was very good. It talks about bad kids and they teach them how to be good. The only thing I didn't like about the book is how they were treated by the counselors. Overall i would recommend this book.
5,Nightmare,"Stanley Yelnats has been wrongly accused of stealing a famous baseball player's shoes and he has two choices: or he goes to a juvenile prison or to Camp Green Lake which is a character building camp. When he gets there, he sees it doesn't have a lake and he has the impression that he isn't going to like it there at all. He was right!!!He had to dig a hole every day for the rest of his time there. And it isn,t just a hole, its a five feet hole. It is like hell!!!Thats not the worstafter he finds out about the yellow spotted lizards that can kill you with just one bite!!!"
2,it was an okel-e-dokele book,There are so many exciting events in the story. But I did not like this book too much because it did not really interest me. Stanley is the main character. I think it was very confusing. This book is not for girl scoutts.
2,Holes,I think this book was not the greatest book in the world because i didn't like the three story lines and i didn'tlike how it went back when camp green lake was a lake
4,The Afual Place,"The book that sends you away to a place and sends you out of your seat. Holes is about a boy that goes to a camp so bad there's nothing to do but dig holes. It's all digging in the hot sun. The warden wants something buried in the sand so the kids are digging. This books so good I read it a second time. Stanley Yelnats who goes to the camp because he did something bad. The camps for bad kids. Just one wrong move and bye, bye, bye. So why couch around, read a book with adventure. Read Holes a book that's worth its review. Holes is that wonderful book."
2,the best book,I thought that it was a good book because it kept me interested in the subject. I liked all of the evnts that happened in the story to keep me reading.I thought that it was funny how Stanly got the shoes and got in trouble with them. I also liked how it ended .... That is mostly all i thought about the book.
3,"J Walsh - phx, az",The book Holes was not very exciting to read that is why I gave it a 3 on how it was. This book did have some interesting parts in it that I kind of liked. Like a part where Stanley tried to take a truck and drive off but then fall into a hole that had been dug. There was another part flowing that when Stanley falls into a hole and finds lizards crawling on him meanwhile he found a treasure box? I would recommend this book to people that like to read.
4,Tyler and Lee's Review,"The novel Holes is a suspenceful book about two boys named Stanley and Zero. Stanley always gets in trouble. They have to dig holes to find somethig for the Warden. Later, the boys are forced to run away. Stanley and Zero are good friends.There are several lessons about the story. They are history always repeats itself, things always happen for a reason, and always think the best. My first point paragraph is history always repeats itself. Everything will always repeat itself. My second point paragraph is Things always happen for a reason. Stanley meets Zero. My third point paragrah is always think the best. When things seem bad, they'll always get better. The book Holes shows all of these things.This book had a good plot. You will want to keep reading this book."
4,"My reveiw of Holes (dull, but it works...)","I thought that Holes was a great book, but I did not like that the book was a fantasy book. I like true stories about famous people. Also the book has very good mysteries to solve, that will be very, very hard to get so be careful what you say. When you finish the book, you are going to want to read the book Holes again."
4,it is an ok book by bartholomew simpson,"i think Holes is an ok book.As you can see, I gave it four stars. It had adventure and suspense.There were some great parts and some boring parts. The best is at the most suspenseful part for Stanley and Zero."
5,Kelly's Review on Holes,"I'am doing my review on the book HOLES by Louis Sachar. The book leaves you wanting to read it over and over agian. Holes is humorous,yet suspencful. The way it was written makes you want to never put it down. Holes takes place in a big dried up lake called Greenlake. But, one lady turned it into camp Greenlake for kids who are bad. The main characters are Stanly who is a boy who always had bad luck. Zero who is a boy who doesn't talk to often . The Warden the owner of Camp Greenlake. Holes is mostly about a boy who has bad luck and just happend to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. He has to go to camp Greenlake and meets new people and learns a mystery about his past. Read HOLES its a really good book!"
4,Holes book review,"This book is called ""Holes"". The author of this book is named Louis Sachar. The genre is an action packed action novel. The setting in this story is a dry desert. Some of the main characters are Stanley Yelnats, Zero, and Mr. Sir. Plus all of the other campers at Camp Green Lake. This story is about a kid who gets in trouble for something he didn't do. He is given a choice of to go either to jail or Camp Green Lake. He choses Camp Green Lake. There he runs in to alot of strange thing. A long family story relates him to a kid he meets at camp. I thought this book was outstanding. I highly recomend this book."
4,Holes was great!,"Holes is book by Louis Sachar. It is a mix between realistic fiction and adventure fiction. It had adventure from start to finish. This book is about a young boy named Stanley Yelnats who is accused of stealing ""Sweet Feet's"" famous shoes. Stanely'spunishment is going to a correctional facilaty called Camp Green Lake where he has to go into a dried up lake where he has to dig up holes. During his time at camp he goes through crazy adventures and meets some new and interesting people. I would definetely recommend it to anyone looking for a great book to sit and read with. I really enjoyed reading this book and I'm looking forward to reading many other books by Louis Sachar."
4,In the end everything ties together,I thought the book was very interesting. I like the way I was held in suspense. I couldn't put the book down I needed to find out what would happen next. My favorite parts were when Stanley had flashbacks to his great-great grandfather's time. It's a great book if you want to go on an adventure.
5,Dig it!,"The title of the book I read is Holes. The author is Louis Sachar. The problem is that a pair of shoes fell out of the sky and hit Stanley Yelnats right on the head. Then the police came and sent him to court. After, he had to go to Camp Green Lake and dig holes. Stanley had to stay there for 18 months. I would recommend this book to a friend who likes adventurous stories. I would rate this book five stars."
2,Holes,Holes is an ok book because I found it boring. Stanly Yelnats was charged with stealing a famous baseball players shoes. He is sentenced to go to a camp for punishment. The name of the camp is Camp Green Lake.When he arrives there he finds out there is no lake.As punishment he has to dig a hole every day. He digs holes the throughout the book. To me this is what makes the story rather boring.
4,An astonishing piece by Sachar...,"This book caught my eye, while I was actually searching for a fantasy/sci fi book, I read the first chapter (only two pages) and I was simply fascinated by the content, I quite openly laughed out loud, right there in the store, after every sentence came a new burst of laughter, Sachar gave me a good laugh, and for that I bought this book. If your reading this, I highly encourage you to buy this book, although the rest of the book wasn't quite as humouristic as the first chapter, I'm quite sure that you will be as impressed as I was with this writing. And since the text is so simple, anyone from the age of 10 to 100 will enjoy this book! My mother is reading it at the moment, and she seems to be enjoying it just as much as I did, so do yourself a favor, and get a copy of this masterpiece, it will keep you occupied for atleast a week, and then you'll read it again, and again and again."
5,The very best book I've read with my students to date!,This book will inspire empathy and incredible class discussions. The plot and characters spin wildly. There are connections to be made around every curve. It's a masterfully spun tale of injustice and vindication. Buy it today!!
5,this was a very good book.,"i really liked this book. the way the two stories came together is so great. previously, i never took Mr. Sachar's books seriously because they seemed like jokes. this book is very different. The story of a boy acused of a crime he didnt do and theboy he met who has a story to tell him!! The adventure Stanley Yelnats and Zero have is amazing."
5,It is a great book.,"I am fourth-grader. I got the book as a Christmas present. I think it is very entertaining, except when it talks just about everyday life. The best part of the book is when Stanley Yelnats runs away to find Zero. The author tells the readers things that the characters don't know, and that makes for suspense. There is a lot of suspense at the end when you have to use your imagination to fill the ""holes"" in the story."
3,Hole's is great,"Hole's, by Louis Sachar was a very fun and interesting book to read. Hole's is a very attention catching book. It was anticipating because the main character had to go through a big punishment for something he didn't even do. So the whole time you are reading the book you are just wandering when they are going to realize he really didn't do anything wrong. In the end his hard work digging holes had paid off.In this book you will meet so many characters that are different in so many ways. If you have ever gotten in trouble for something you didn't really do then you know how frustrating it can be. Stanley got in trouble for something he didn't really do or didn't really mean to do but he gets punished and it is a very harsh punishment. So just reading it will make you somewhat frustrated.This book would be recommended to people who think they always have bad luck. You don't know bad luck until you read this book and learn about Stanley and his family's bed luck."
3,THIS BOOK WOULD BE A GOOD BOOK FOR KIDS THAT LIKE TO READ,THIS BOOK WAS GOOD. IT WAS LONG BUT WORTH THE TIME. THE AUTHOR LOUIES SACHAR MIXED THREE STORIES INTO ONE CONCLUTION. THE BOOK WAS GOOD AND I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD GO OUT AND READ THIS BOOK.
3,The wonderful book of holes!,Holes was a very interesting story. Who would every think of digging holes for punishment? Holes is cool it is a good book for middle school!It was a very unige story.some parts was boring like when he has to go to court and then they acuse him from stealing shoes i mean come on who cares about some one who steals shoes and it really was some one else who was at camp green lake.It was an adventure book i think and it was kind of stupid I felt like falling asleep ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ SNOR just kidding.Well i hope you enjoy your time reading this book have FUN!
4,Chelsea's review,"Holes is a very good book ,it had lots of action. I would recimed this book to anyone who likes action books.I think that the writer makes you feel like you are in the book."
5,holes,"I would give Holes five stars because it was very interesting,and funny.This is about a boy named,Stanley Yelnats.He stole a pair of shoes and had to go to a detention camp.There he meets alot of boys.One of the boys named, Zero to be exact is going to become one of"
4,Holes is the best book,"I really liked this book it has unforgettable charecters and a great plot. It is about Stanley Yelnats who has horrible luck and is always at the wrong place at the wrong time. He gets sent to Camp Green Lake, where boys dig holes to develop charecter. Stanley must find the mystery of why they are digging and end the curse on his family. It is a great book and got my brother in to reading."
5,great book!,"My students wanted to read it...but the school library said they were too young. So before I felt that I could reccomend it to the parents, I had to read it myself. It was GREAT! The various threads of the story wind to a great conclusion. After reading it, I felt that it was appropriate for my students (3rd) grade...any of the students who wouldn't want to read or it couldn't understand the story would put it down rather quickly."
2,holes,"holesLouis SacharThe book is called HOLES the wirtter of the story is Louis Sacher. The first time I saw the book I thorth the book was about a lizard but when I started reading blurb I wanted to read the book.The book is about a boy called Stanley he was in camp green lakeBecause people thorth he sole Clied Living Stone shoes, it is the ceurs of the great grant grant grand father elya.Elay had a comption who has the biggest pig 2 weeks to have the biggest pig and she is had to bring miss Myra menke up a mount and sing to her but he did not and he had a cears."
3,Holes,"I think that this book was kind of boaring. Not so boaring that it will put me to sleep. That is why i rate it three stars. I did like some parts of the story, for example, were Zero hit Mr.Pendanski with a shovel and he run's away. Also there are some parts of the book that they keeped on repeding like: All thanks of your no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather. I don't like when his grandfather keep's on saying that because it's like repeding the book over and over again. The question that i would ask would be why would somebody make people especially young kids to dig holes all afternoon? Why can't you just do it yourself? I think that Stanley Yelnats is a cool name because you can spell it backwards."
5,A Book With Twists Of Fate,"This book is good for siblings and young adults. This book is very adventerous and has you hooked at the end of every chapter that makes you want to keep reading.I suggest that you take your time reading it because it changes from the past and future quickly. If you read through it fast, it well get you confused. Overall, I think this is a great book and you should consider reading it."
3,Holes,"This book starts off with Stanley Yelnats sitting by himself on a bus for commiting a crime he didnt do. He ends up at camp green lake where he meets, the she is a very mean lady who makes all the kids dig holes cause there is some sort of treasure that is there. Stanley is not as tough as the other boys so its difficult to fit in till he meets Zero who is the only kid who will befriend Stanley. Zero and Stanleyend up figguring out what the Warden is up to and they run away off on an adventure and try to find an object called God's thumb. This book is for a teen audience and I would reccomend this book for people who love to read about friend ship and adventure."
4,HOLES: A GREAT BOOK,"Holes is a great book but I don't really care for it .The book holes is about a boy name Staley Yelats his family has beencurse because his great gandfather. When Staley was walking back from school then something flow out of thesky. It was a famous baseball player shoes.Every one thought that staley stole the shoes.So he had to go to court.The court told staley and his family he could go to jail or camp green lake,and he choose to go to camp.He met some friends there.Staley was sent to tent D.Then days pass and no news happened.Then zero staleys friend ran away.Staley had to find him. Staleys athority came and staley found the treasure.He took it home with him.Staley and zero got rich and that all I can say.You can find out more from other review."
3,Holes,"Stanley is the main character of the book Holes. He is accused of stealing a pair of shoes. For his punishment he has to go to Camp Green Lake. The camp was supposed to build character. I thought it was just a way to get rid of bad kids. By sending kids to Camp Green Lake people didn't have to worry about them getting into trouble.I highly recommend this book. There is a lot of drama and Stanley is very self conscious in this story. He battles a lot of stuff including the staff at Camp Green Lake, yellow spotted lizards and himself. As you can tell this book is very interesting. I thought it was a good book and I would like to read it again."
5,good for all ages,"I have only one word for this book. ""Nice."" This book is good for all ages 5 to 153. This book has action and mistory in one awsome book. I think people should see the book before the movie it will help a hole lot. (get it hole as in holes lol)"
4,Sweaty Palms,Sweaty palmsThis is an exciting book.Its startes out that stanley is accused with stealing sneakers. He had to choose between jail or camp green lake.Stanley chooses camp green lake. When he gets there he is sent to dig holes all through the day.He becomes great friends with a guy named zero.To find out what happens to stanley yelnats thats up to you to read the book and find out.
3,Holes,I think the book was ok! This book was about a boy named Stanley Yelnats. Yes his first named spells his last name back wards. Anyways Stanley gets framed for stealing. He has 2 choices Camp Green Lake or jail! He picked Camp Green Lake. He had to dig holes. Not just any hole but a hole that is 5 foot deep and 5 feet wide. It was hard for him to dig a hole every day. Stanley slept in tent D. His nick name was Caveman. One day one of Stanley's camp member ran away to a desedrt that surrounded the camp. Caveman went after him. Do they die or survive?
4,The Hole that keeps on going,"The book Holes is one of the best i have ever read. Between the plot and the characters this book was great! the funniest part is when you found out that Stanley's dad was trying to find a way to recycle old sneakers. This book is about a boy named Stanley Yelnats. He is a kid that is overweight and made fun of because of that. One day after fishing out his notebook from the toilet and walking out of school a pair of shoes came flying down from the sky. That made Stanley think that is was destiny so that his dad would discover how to recycle old shoes. So he took the and ran. A police man\woman stopped him and asked him why he was running so Stanley showed them the shoes. Then the next thing he knew he was in a courtroom and being asked if he wanted to either go to Camp Green Lake or jail. So then Stanley knew who to blame............ ""his no-good-rotten-pig stealing great-great grandfather"". So of course ended up at Green Lake. ETC."
5,Review by Juicy Catoure,"Holes is an awesome book, about the not-so-ordinary life of a not-so-ordinary boy- Stanley Yelnats. As Sachar wrote the book being a story-within-a-story-within-a-story,it has a lot of interesting connections within the characters, and their actions. My favorite charcater was Kate Barlow, because she has a mind of her own, and she isn't afraid of what people think of her, as long as she gets to think what she wants. I miss reading this book in class, and as Sam would say..""I can fix that.""I loved Sachar's way of writing this trio of stories and generations, and it was one of my favorite books that I have ever read. I hope that whoever reads this book enjoys it as much as I did!"
4,My Holes Review By TT,"I like the book Holes.I would read it again and even a second story.I like when Louis Sachar would take us into Kissin Kate Barlow and Sam`s world.I like when Zero and Stanley say that ""Mary Lou would probably look good in a bathing suit.""I also like when Mr.Sir would say,""You're not in Girl Scout Camp anymore"".The ending gave me the chills and I hope I am never in that situation!-TT"
4,My Review on Holes,"I liked the book HOLES because it was very suspenseful.You would always wonder what would happen next.It was great going though all the adventures. IT was really fun with all the surpises that you find out thoughout the book. When you read this story it is great to think about how everything has a purpose. My favorite quote is "" This isn't girl scout camp"". The setting of the camp was wonderful. It felt as if you were really going though the adventure. I didn't like some parts of the story. It got confusing when we went into Elya's world , to Kate's, and then back to Stanley's. I also didn't like how at the end of the story Sachar left us hanging at the end of our chairs. I want to know what happened. I mustly loved the story though. I thought the story had an amazing theme and everyone should read it."
4,Holes,I would say it was pretty good.It had good action and a lot of feeling into it.This book is about Stanley Yelnats and his adventure at Camp Green Lake.(Yelnats is Stanley backwards or in literary terms a palindrome)There are plenty of characters in Holes. Holes is a story within a story within a story. Sachar fills in a lot of detail when Stanley is at Camp Green Lake butat the end Sachar puts a one and a half year gap at the end.You eventually figure out some of the things that happen in the gap but not all of them.You don't have to worry about the ending the big gap is at chapter 50. I would have given this book a 5 but the ending just makes it more of a 4i hope this review will give you an idea about Holes.
5,Wonderful book for kids,"""Holes"" really made me laugh. It was everything put together. Stanley just had back luck and at the end.. well you will just have to read the book."
5,The best of Louis Sachar!,"And you thought the Wayside School series was hilarious. While not as silly as his previous books, HOLES is still very entertaining. It is his best work, so far. Am anxiously waiting for his next book. Stanley was innocent when he got sent to Camp Green Lake. But he gains new friends and courage at camp. Plus, find out what the holes are REALLY for!"
5,I really liked the setting because it fit well with the book,This book is really fasinating. It had great realistic characters. Stanley deserves a 10! He showed pride and he never gave up. Zero is my favorite character because he was so quiet at the beginning and then he wanted to learn and stand up for himself. This is a perfect for teens.
3,Kids book,For what the book was purchased for it is ok. The story builds for some time and I felt that the end just kind of left me wanting.
5,required rising 6th grader reader,When I first saw this title on daughters school website as required reading my opinion was quite low for the lacking creativity in title. She and I sat down over the course of several nights reading this book together and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the unexpected plot twists this book took. Very talented writer.
5,A fantastic book,"The characters in Holes are Stanley Yelnats the 4th,his grandpa,his dad,and his mom. At Camp Green Lake thier was Zig Zag,Arpit,Twitch,Xray,Zero,Mr. Sir,the Warden,and Mr. Pendenski. The setting took place at Camp Green Lake. Sanley Yelnats the 4th went to Camp Green Lake because the police thought Stanley stole a baseball players shoes, but he dident. He made new friends but Zero was his best friend. And a adventure comes up!..."
5,Holes,I liked this book. I would not recommend it to kids younger than nine years old. I liked how the author switched back and forth between past time and present. The climax was exciting. Thumbs up!!!
4,Holes,"Holes is an okay book because you can learn a lot. I like Stanley and Zero because they both have strong emotions. This book starts out with Stanley getting hit on the head with shoes and the police thinking that he stole them. Stanley and his parents think it's because of their family's curse. To find out more about Holes, go read the book."
5,Holes,I liked the book because it was full of suspense. The main character was Stanley Yelnats. He is under a curse because of his great-great-grandfather. Because of the curse he gets sent to a horrid camp. To find out more buy the book!
4,"Stop digging those Holes, read the book!!!","I would recommend this book for ages 8-12. It's a fun and exciting book. It takes you through a wasteland and the history of the wasteland. In this book you will discover friendship, fun and adventure.You would like this book if you like books by Louis Sachar or adventurous books. I suggest you read this book right now!"
4,holes,"holes is a thrilling adventure story about stanley yelnats and his great great no-good, dirty, rotten, pig-stealn' grandfather. stanley is sent to camp greenlake for ""stealing"" a pair sneaker that he did not steal. there, the warden has them dig for something, something that has been lost for years and looked for for years. all the while a story of stanley's great, great grandfather and kate barlow and a curse is interwoven into the story in a majical way. this was a great read for me and should be for you. i recomend this book to kids of all ages and thier parents too.-chris hartmann"
4,Holes am amazing story with in a story with in a story`,"The Book Holes is a very unique book, Which is very well written. It will take you on a hole bunch of twists and turns while reading it. But over all it was a great book. The book Holes was not just a story but a story with in a story with in a story,this is why i liked the book so much/"
3,THE MYSTERY BEHIND THE JEWELS,"When you read the story HOLES you will be a little shocked because it has a gold ribbon. In the beginning,it will be very boring. As you read on,it will get a little more interesting. When they take you back in the past, you will wish the story was only about the past and not the past and present. When you read there will be things you do not understand, but Louis Sachar fills in your HOLES IF ONLY IF ONLY YOU UNDERSTAND!"
4,"Holes is good, but donut holes are better!","I thought Holes was a pretty good all around book.I'm a movie guy,but sometimes it makes you want to read more because you don't know what is going to happen next.The author of Holes, Louis Sachar, made Holes suspenseful and confusing at sometimes because he will switch from one scene to the next quickly. As you're reading, you know a bunch of things that won't come together until the end.I would suggest Holes for readers of all ages."
5,A New Classic,"WOW! is all i said after reading this book to tell you all the truth i thought oh well i guess i will read this.... and ended up saying ""what if i haden't read this?"" now like many others my favorite books are the Harry Potter Series and charlotes Web but now count this one as 2 favorite!"
4,Holes,"People think that putting someone in camp will help them behave. In Holes, that's true. Holes is a story about a boy named Stanley Yelnats. Police officers thought Stanley committed a crime. For his punishment,Stanley has to dig holes from sunup to sundown. He feels like he is in the desert. Read this book to see if he survives digging Holes for time. This is a great book because I think that this will give you an adventure to look forward to. You will find yourself reading this book nonestop. Enjoy this book!"
5,Wonderful book!,"This was a weird book, with all the sort of flashbacks and how the story fit together. I was a little confused at first, but I really liked it. The best part was all the characters and how they had such obvious personalities. It is definitely worth reading and very enjoyable, especially the second, and third, and fourth times!"
4,holes is great,I loved this book- I suggest that everyone read it no matter how old or young they are- it was great!!!
5,Defies Description! A Must Read for ALL Ages!,"This is supposed to be a book for kids and young adults? I'm 42 years old and I loved it. It's tough to describe, so I won't even bother. If you are looking for a quick and wonderful summer read, this is it. Beware! Once you pick it up, you can't put it down. I was up past midnight last night finishing it, and I can't tell you the last time that happened! Bravo to Louis Sachar!"
4,holes,"HOLESHoles is about a boy named Stanley Yelnats. A boy who's luck got turned upside down a long time ago. Stanley was caught stealing a pair of shoes that he didn't steal. Stanley had the choice of juvenile or Camp Green Lake. Stanley had never been to camp so he was sentthere. At Camp Green Lake all they did was dig holes as deep and wide as their shovels. Stanley meets a few friends: Zero, X ray, Armpit, Zigzag and many more. Zero was being made fun of by the leaders so he ran away and Stanley was sent out to save him. When Stanley caught up with him he was sick. Stanley carried him up the mountain that looks like a thumb. The author explains a lot about the characters and the land. The book is good and tells you what might happen if you steal something. I learned that bad things happen.- Hayden Wood"
4,Holes,"Holes is a book about a boy Stanley Yelnats who is walking home when a pair of sneakers belonging to a famous basketball player dropped on his head. The cops stopped him. He has to go to court. Stanley is found guilty and is sent to Camp Green Lake. There are lots of boys his age there. Everyday they dig holes looking for a treasure.My favorite part in book is when Zero, Stanley's friend runs away and Stanley finds him. They dig hole at night when no one is around. They find the treasure but get caught by the warden. Some things happen to the boys, poisonous yellow spotted lizard, they have no water and nothing to eat but onions.I would recommend this book because it is very adventurous, and easy to read. I had a lot of fun reading it."
5,Awesome book,This was one of the best books I've ever read I seriously encourage other readers go get this bookBecause it was great
4,movie is more interesting,"I enjoyed the movie version so much that I wanted to read the book. I enjoyed reading the book, however the movie was more interesting, a whole lot of fun, and tugged at my heartstrings. If you haven't seen the movie yet, read the book first."
4,Cool,"I really liked this book. It had a great story,double stories were nice as well.I liked this book because of the characters as well."
4,Holes,"I read Holes to my two children at bedtime. They really liked it. The characters were funny, and the book led to good discussions. I recommended this book to anyone who enjoys reading to their kids at night."
3,A Hole-y Review,"I thought that Holes definitely wasn't Louis Sachar's best book. It didn't have as many interesting details as the plot had potential for, and the book kept flipping back and forth from two stories. I didn't like that because when you got back to Stanley Yelnats (the main character's) story, you couldn't understand it as well because the other story was fresh in your mind. This is also not the typical type of book Louis Sachar writes. It was much more serious and less funny. All in all, I think that this is the kind of book you take out of the library for a one-time read, not buy and keep forever."
5,Holes is a very well-written book!,Louis Sachar waas the author of a very well-written book. A kid named Stanley Yelnats was convicted of stealing a famous baseball player's shoes that were supposed to go to charity for money. My favorite part of the book was when they had to dig holes that were five feet deep and five feet long. I really recommend this book.
4,Great Book,"Children both young and old will like Holes. I loved the blend of humor, and mystery. I have read alot of books but Holes is up there in the top 5, once you pick it up you never want to put it down .Take it from me, I spent 5 hours laying on a couch."
5,Twisty. I loved how you went back in time.,"This book had many plots. I love that! I liked how it was all involved with the future and the past. With the Great Great Grandparents. I loved how there was a big curse on everything like the lake and on Stanley's family. I loved how everything that happened in the past was tied up with the future. For example: I got everything in the book except one thing. I didn't relize that in the end the yellow-spotted lizards didn't bite Stanley and Zero because they had onion blood in them. That's the only time I didn't make the connection with the past and future. I only relized that when my mother (We read the book together) pionted it out to me. VERY TWISTY BOOK! I LOVED IT SO MUCH! NOTE TO THE AUTHOR: WRITE MORE BOOKS JUST LIKE THIS ONE PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank You! Sincerly, Tricia Pugsley*"
5,The Best Plotted Story I've Ever Read!,"Stanley Yelants digs himself into a few holes by accidently being in the wrong place at the wrong time. He ends up at some kind of boot camp and is digging holes till he gets let out. With a plot that keeps you hooked and whining for more when it's time to turn out the light, Holes takes you through a roller coaster ride of ups and downs. The end will surprise you in many ways! I recommend this book to an adult, also, because he or she will be wondering why they didn't make these kind of books for people there age! I also recommend this book who loves a good book that makes you think."
4,Excellent!,"After many of my friends recommended this novel to me, Ifinally decided to read Holes. Though the book was easy reading, itgot a very good point across through an excellent story. I loved the way everything tied together in the end, but the book did not have enough to hold me captivated for more than an hour at a time. I recommend this book if you liked The Giver."
4,I'm Impressed!,"I have to confess that I have not read ""Holes"" myself - yet. My 13-year-old stepdaughter is reading it in summer school and has been talking about it non-stop. She is a very reluctant reader and usually NEVER reads unless she has to. She cannot wait to see what comes next in this book, and that, if nothing else, convinces me that this book must really be special. I can't wait to find out for myself."
5,"Defies the Medium, A New Classic","A book usually has a demographic. This book has one as well, everyone. I would be hard-pressed to find an avid reader that would not enjoy this read. You could pick a part the writing and the detail, but by doing that you are admitting that you did not fully understand what the book meant. It is a non-demographic book only rivaled by The Hobbit. If you like a story that includes a little bit of everything, and a lot of heart, check out Holes."
5,Spellbinding -- I read it in one sitting...,"The fact this is written by a children's author doesn't mean it's no more than a children's book.Sachar's ""Wayside School"" stories are delightful. But this one is pure art. Think of Roald Dahl at his best --""Danny"" ""Mathilda"" ""James""And Dahl's adult books, too. ""Holes"" may be designed for the ""grade 5-9"" set, but it's really a book for the ages...and for any age..."
2,A nice little book but hardly worth the hoopla,"I bought this book as a gift for a young relative who had finished all the Harry Potter books, and decided to read it myself first. It was interesting, but I kept waiting to get ""hooked"" into the book and it never happened. I thought the plot was interesting, but slight. It was not a bad little book, but I would still take Harry Potter any day. I could hardly put down the Harry Potter books but this one I had to keep forcing myself to pick up."
4,One hole a day,I think holes is a really good book.I would recommend it to anybody who likes funny books. I really liked it.My favorite part was when Stanley went to look for Zero. I thought this was the best book I read. I liked it and you can too!!!!!!
4,"How I Rated ""Holes""","I really likes this book, I would have gave it five stars, but I've read better. The main thing I like about this book is the climax. I think this book should deserve a medal for the best climax. If anymore to say, this was a really good book. -Maria Barragan"
5,I never laughed so hard--it's simply hilarious,"The book ""Ugh"" written by Arthur Yorinks and illustrated by Richard Egielski was one of the funniest books that I have ever read. It kind of reminded me of ""Cinderella"" but it had its own sense of pre-historic mystic and plot. I truly hoped that the author will be inspired to tell us a little bit more about ""Ugh."" Perhaps a sequel would be nice . . . Either way this book is great. I never laughed so hard-- its simply hilarious!"
2,Quality not very good,"Quality not very good. My expectations for a Russell Athletic product were not met. To me, the material was of a very low grade."
1,Disappointed,"For years I have loved Russell Athletic products (I have one shirt that I have worn at least 500 times and it still looks new), but then my local Academy stopped carrying them. Although I prefer to buy locally, I had no choice and so ordered from Amazon. One of the shirts I bought came out of its third laundry cycle with the sleeve seams split in several places. Not what I had expected!"
1,very disappointing,"The first time my son wore this shirt the length was great, as soon as I washed and dried (on low) the shirt shrunk. Do not wash, this shirt will shrink drastically. At least 3 inches."
2,Inconsistent sizes,"I ordered 3 of these and they were not only on the small side, they also had significant size differences between supposedly equal sized shirts... Someone slip some irregulars into this batch?"
5,Big and Tall Solid T-Shirt,"Finally, a shirt that doesn't ride up over my husband's belly when he raises his arms. This has always been a problem for him. He bends over and the shirt rides up or he does something above his head and up goes the shirt. This one will not do that because it comes down to hip level just like the picture."
4,Excellent quality black T-shirts,These Russell T-shirts are of excellent quality and fit. They stay black with repeated washings in Tide with bleach. I am a little nutty in that these are a sort of uniform for me since I am retired and I wear what I think looks good and is comfortable. The price is right and I bought one dozen. Now I hope my girlfriend doesn't get tired of this look.
2,Holes and Insects,"The packaging had dead insects in it, and in one of the 3 shirts there was a hole in it, near the collar. Whether it was a sewing mistake or insect munching, I don't know."
1,Russell Athletic Tee,I am very disappointed in the T-Shirt that I received. Not only does it have small flaws but it is NOT the T-Shirt that is pictured on the web site. I will NOT be ordering anything else from this vendor.
1,Extremely Poor Sizing,"We have purchased Russell Athletic tshirts in the past and they were very true to size. My husband is 6'6"" and this ""tall"" size is at least 4""-6"" short in the length compared to Reebok, Nautica and Cutter & Buck. Such a disappointment. I even washed them in cold water. I will say that the quality of the material of the shirt is good but does me no good if he won't wear them. Will NEVER buy these again!"
2,Shirts shrink considerably,"I bought these shirts because i have a hard time finding good shirts for tall people (6'3"" 270lbs). These shirts all shrank up in just a couple of washed the carhartt tall shirts have been far superior to these and so I will not be buying any more of these shirts."
3,Russell Big & Tall t-shirt,"This is a pretty decent shirt just be aware it is cotton so it will tend to shrink in the wash just something to consider when ordering for size. I am a pretty big guy at 6' 280lbs. not in a round sense but length wise and it's kinda hard for me to find XL shirts that fit me in length as well as width (im kinda chesty too) and these shirts are good for that, the neck is kinda tight for me but that just might be me, anyways all in all these shirts are good for hitting the gym or just being lazy at home. Good price but if your skeptical order one and see how you like it."
1,Not good for Tall Men!,Disappointing! This t-shirt shrank about five(!)inches in the length even though I followed laundering directions on the label.
5,Perfect shirt,This shirt is just what I wanted. The material and the sewing is just great. It is long enough and has all the right stiches.
1,rubdown-has its moments but otherwise a big letdown,"Rubdown is a typical routine run-of-the mill made for cable - type thriller.There is nothing special about this lukewarm thriller which promises a lot and only disappoints. Only highlight is to see a gorgeous Michelle Phillips being greased up in brief ""rubdown"" scene plus good shot of her naked back in one bedroom scene"
5,"Amazing, soothing, wonderful","Emily's clever lyrics and soothing melodies are sure to lift your spirits. I've had the privilege of seeing her live, and she is truly an amazing person. Buy the album, and visit her site (which has some samples): ..."
2,For the young reader.,TH and B has limited value as a history. It is very light reading and more suited to the young reader.
3,Namby Pamby Actor Contradicts His War History,"I'm 20 pages away from finishing ""To Hell and Back."" After Googling, still don't know who the ghost writer was.Still mesmerized how such a daring infrantry man morphed to Hollywood and appeared on camera as such a wooz. In the book it's made clear that he didn't drink or smoke (despite his hard-scrabble youth), but geez.Yes he was good-looking, but Hollywood made him into a boring goodie-two-shoes. Was it about, as usuall, $?"
2,Bad,"This is one of the corniest and poorly written books I have ever read. With GI Joe conversations and mentality, it boasts about American superiority in everything. The book doesn't even really describe Murphy himself, since the descriptions seem to focus on secondary characters. And how does Murphy know how many soldiers he incapacitated? What, did he carve notches in his gun? REAL soldiers aren't proud of how many people they killed. Anybody can pin a whole bunch of medals on somebody; they don't have to deserve it. Those medals could have gone to soldiers who really deserved them. This book is a joke. If you want REAL heroism, check out Ghost Soldiers or The Forgotten Soldier. Don't waste your time."
3,Murphy,"I thought the book spent an inordinate amount o ftime describing the conversations between the soldiers. It did show the strong relationships between the veterans, but the stories about ""a girl I knew in..."" got a little boring."
3,My Dads Hero,Audie Murphy wrote this the way he heard it and saw it. Very fast easy read yet interesting. Would like to see a follow up tohis story.
5,Gripping,A thrilling autobiography of possibly the most famous Medal of Honor winner. A classic in the genre of WWII writing. Later made into a movie staring Murphy playing himself.
5,read this book,A fantastic true stroy of the agony of war by the most decorated soldier. Share with a friend when you are done.
2,.,I just couldn't get into this. I wont be too harsh about it because reading something when sick doesn't give it a fair shot. Let's just say it wasn't a faith healing read.
2,Very weak.,"This book had none of the elements I've come to expect from good romantica. The plots were stupid, the love scenes were paltry and, aside from the characters falling in love with each other in a day, there was no romance. This was my first book by this author, and I'm not sure I'll bother with others. Save your money. If you must read this book then do as I did, and check it out of your local library."
5,Wonderful Voice In Erotic Comedy,"First I won't give you a repeat of what each story in this book is about, everyone else did a great job of doing that. I will say that MaryJanice Davidson did an excellent job of bringing these 6 charactors to life. Ms Davidson always writes a wonderful, sexy, humorous story and this one is no exception. I love her heroines, each one is someone you would like to either know better or be yourself. Her heroes are all different and sexy as sin. She has the ability to turn the heat up while making you laugh out loud, I love that! Give this book a try if you haven't. I also loved her stories in the Secrets Books, those werewolves are to die for. She also has some ebooks at Ellora's Cave that I really enjoyed. Ms Davidson if you read this please keep up the good work, and we want more of those werewolves!"
3,Some What Brutal...,"I got this guitar strap for my fiances birthday.Hes only had it for three months and the spikes are already falling off of it,And he takes good care of his belongings especially his guitar items.We personally think that there are not enough spikes on it so if your like us and love the spikes then this probably isnt the strap for you.Its tolerable,it came with some scratches on it but overall it was packaged nicely it arrived a little late but not by much.The spikes have a protective plastic underneath em which dont look that great.The strap is good for now until he can get a better one we saw for the same price,better spikes and all.He doesnt like the way it fits either its a bit uncomfortable and that I can tell when I watch him play;) So overall we give it a 3 out of 5. A little hint band websites usually have the better merch."
1,no worse,"This book could not get any more boring. I do not recomend this, or and other dragon ball z product!"
1,Useless- It's Not updated already 12 Years!,"Such books make me wonder how is it possible someone to sell a product and DOESN'T care at all how incredibly outdated and useless is its content/quality. Well, then its up to us to think carefully for what we will give our hard earn money. I want a reliable and up-to-date book and that's why will NOT recommend this one because since 1994 it is good for nothing."
4,How to recognize antiques,"This book is old, but so is the subject matter! You will not find the value of specific antiques here, but what you will find is a wealth of knowledge and lots of accompanying pictures that will help you identify antiques. Some of the chapter headings are: What is an Antique, Country Furniture, Victorian Furniture, Mirrors and Frames, Clocks and Watches, Lamps and Lighting Fixtures, Glass, Pottery, China, Silver, Family Possessions, and more. Well worth the purchase price if you are a lover of antiques!"
5,Great Book!,"Are you wondering if your junk may just be a treasure? If you are this is a really good starter book to check on some of those pieces.The author gives you over sixteen categories such as, ""Country Furniture,"" and ""Pottery and Porcelain.""In these she shows some pictures and gives detailed explanation of other pieces to help you identify an object that maybe of value.Although this is an older book, it is very well done, easy to read and quite informative. A great help for the beginning treasure hunter."
2,Not too bad,"Sudharani Raghupathy's team just started their journey into the commercial DVD production, and made the viewers dizzy with the 3 camera cuts changing each other very clumsily. The cameramen thought they were making a pop music video hit, and they mostly shot from the ceiling. Except for T.M. Sridevi, all other dancers can be better employed as scarecrows. By the way, on jayqworld there are online video fragments from this DVD, in case you want to preview it, and the details of the contents. In this DVD, I liked the fragment where Kitappa Pillai was watching the early Sudharani's students in Thanjavur. It is a pity that the best of Sudharani's dancers have grown out of shape, and she does not have anyone else as good as T.M. Sridevi. All in all, Sudharani Raghupathy's concept of this DVD is quite scholarly. And the Dolby audio is superb."
4,Better than the first one...A must have,"This album is way better than her first one. It brings out her real style in music. The whole album is just great, my fav. tracks are 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 13, well, that's just some of them. You gotta get this album, you won't be disappointed. It's a must have & it's worth the money too."
5,Brandy Rulez!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"In this captivating cd of Brandy's best songs ever, she really brings out her voice and talent showing the word how great she is!!!!!"
5,"AWESOME, SHE IS TOOOOOOOOOOOOO COOL< THE BOMB",Every song on this album is tooooooo goood. There is no comparison to any of the other artist she is compared with because they are at a much lower level than she is.
4,Pretty Good CD,"This is a pretty good CD, compared to a lot of other CDs on the market now, but you can get tired of the songs easily. I like ""One Voice"" a lot, I think Brandy should get into more gospel songs. Basically, if you like singers like Monica, you'll like this CD."
5,This album is the shhhhh!,This is one of Brandt's best ever. She has matured so much from the last album.
4,Brandy has matured,"Wow! This is a great CD. Brandy has really matured from when she released her first album. She really seems to be emotionally attached to the songs, unlike her first album. I recommend buying this CD."
5,you can never say never to brandy.,brandy has become a young musical giant in her own style of music paving the way for other young up and coming artists. more power to you brandy.
2,Brandy can't sing good as Monica,"The only reason I liked Brandy's new album b/c it has phat beats. She thinks she's so better than Monica, but she's not. Work on your vocals skills b/c it sounds like you have a hairball in your throat everytime you sing."
2,once a talent now a wash up,YOU NO A BOUGHT HER FIRST CD BECAUSE SHE HAD TALENT SO OF COURSE I BY NEVER SAY NEVER AND I WISH I DIDNT BECAUSE THAT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY YOU CAN NOT UNDER STAND ONE WORD SHE SAYS AND THE FEW TRACKS YOU CAN THEY ARE BORING SUCH AS TRUTHFULLY AND HER VERSION OF EVERY THING I DO I DO IT FOR YOU WICH WILL PUT YOU TO SLEEP
3,It wasn't all that,This album wasn't that good it was a waste of money. Brandy's voice is really Raspy. She sounded better on her first one. I guess that's what happens when you take a couple years off of singing.
3,Average Album,"I thought this was an ok album. She's ok but Monica is better. Monica's also better looking...way better. There are only a couple good songs but some of them sound horrible. This includes ""Never Say Never,"" ""Almost doesn't count,"" etc. They have weird beats and dumb lyrics. Who would enjoy listening to those songs? Don't waste your money because I did, believing the CD would be good from others. Try buy Monica's and make yourself happy."
4,The girl has done it AGAIN,"At age 19, Brandy has accomplished so many things in her life, and it's amazing that she has recorded another one of her albums that I reckon will go No-1 all the way. I am one of her biggest fans, and I am proud to see that she hasn't let anything stand in the way of her dream. You go girl!"
4,Brandy's Best,"I love this CD more than her first one. It has some HOT tracks with 13/16 of them being produced by the Jerkins brothers (mainly Rodney). By far the best song on this record is 'Truthfully,' but some other great ones are 'Top Of The World' (with the former rapper turned preacher Ma$e), 'Have You Ever?,' 'Never Say Never,' 'One Voice,' etc. There are only 3 songs that aren't that great and all the interludes. Though I gave it four stars, it would've gotten 4 1/2 or 5 if those interludes weren't on there cause I really think they ruin any CD."
5,A CLASSIC 4RM BRANDY,I think this is her best album throughout her career she is one of the best female R&B; Songtress alive.Best TracksAngel In DisguiseLearn The Hard WayU Dont Know MeNever Say NeverHave You EverHOTTT album must get if u are a brandy fan
4,Well done Brandy!!!!,"Well I loved her new album so much that I bought Never say never and Full Moon, both by the way are excellent albums. She co-writes really good songs. The production is excellent and displays Brandy's raspy vocals at her best. Songs also have some entrancing beats such as 'Angel in Disguise"", 'U dont know me like you used to' and ""Learn the Hard Way"", this album is great. If you get this album make sure to buy a copy of Full Moon and Afrodisiac."
2,Say NEVER to this Cd...,Brandy's voice is so edited that this CD is hollow. The Boy Is Mine is strong because of Monica. The only reason this CD has done well is because she has very good producers that could make the songs sound great even if a duck sang them... and they did but it's not worth it.
1,Boring Boring Boring!!!,"No hard feelings...but this cd was quite abburido boring in other words... Song after song of endless whinning about men who don't care, love, or value women I CANNOT STAND THIS KIND OF BOO HOO PLS COME BACK MUSIC....Next time Brandy spice it up okay!"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Go out and buy Monica's CD instead. Brandy is the most talentless person out there! What do people see in her? She can't sing, act, OR dance and those braids are getting a little old. So don't waste your money on a CD that really isn't worth it."
4,a great album.,"This album has some totally phat beats and proves Brandy can sing really good. I never bought this album for the way over-played ""The Boy is Mine"" though, which is one of the worst on the album. The rest of the album is pure magic."
5,Brandys Best Yet,"I just bought Full Moon and have to say that it dosen't compare to NEVER SAY NEVER. I was so impressed with this cd when it came out about 3 years ago. This cd is jam packed with overlooked hits. I would definetly suggest this cd to anyone. It's filled with good beats, lyrics and Brandys sultry voice. You cant go wrong with Never Say Never. One Love"
5,BEAUTIFUL ALBUM,"I love this album anyone who listens to music wil love this album.There are so many good songs on here,but the best is definitely ""Have you ever"" wrriten by diane warren my greates inspiration as an undiscovered song writter anyways this song is beautiful we all can relate to it I know I can.Brandy wrote 7 songs on here and produced 9 she executive produced it to,she also wrote the theme to her tv show she is quite busy but all the effort paid off she sold over 5 million copies of never say never. GET THIS CD IT'S WORTH YOUR MONEY"
3,How could anyone ever compare her to Monica?,I dont know who told her she could sing but they need to be slapped for that.She is so ugly with her big head and whoever signed her to Cover girl needs to be slapped too. The beats were tight but in all the songs she sounds the same with no variety at all. She cant act either and if I had bought Monica's c.d first I would never have bought hers.Monica sings and looks 100x better than her.Im tired of seein her wit all that weave......get a new do.
4,Almost Excellent,"Brandy is a great actress and singer. I really like this album, but after a while, all the songs start to sound the same. I LOVE almost doesn't count, and have you ever, top of the world, and angel is disguise are all good songs too, but the rest are just average."
5,LUV this!!!!!!!,"this CD is the best! The boy is Mine is one cool track, but the rest are just as good!!!! Get it now!"
5,I got this CD last week and it hasn't left my CD player yet!,"I have listened to Never Say Never every day since I got it. It is a great CD! I am very impressed by Brandy's talent, both musically and acting wise. She is an amazing singer and I can't wait to see her on the big screen in I Still Know What You Did Last Summer! I hope she doesn't wait as long before she makes another album--it was such a LONG wait but it was well worth it!!!"
4,It was a good soundtrack even better than the first.,"This Soundtrack was excellent. My favorite songs are Angel in Disguise,The Boy is mine, and Top of the World."
4,Brandy's Best,"I love Never Say Never it is a good album and it is definetly better than her first CD. I like most of the songs on the album but I hate ""Top Of The World"" that song is boring!!! Well My favorite song on the whole album is ""(Everything I Do) I Do It For You"" I love that song!!! You wont be disappointed when you pick up this album you should get it!!"
3,Maybe next time. . .,"Brandy tries, really she does. But all the songs on the album sound the same and her voice could use a little work. There are some good songs on the album; One Voice, The Boy is Mine, Everything I do. . ., & Top of the World. But, the rest are kind of boring."
1,"Brandy the actress- Yes, Brandy the singer -NO!","Don't get me wrong, I love to see a woman (young lady) do her thing in a respectful manner but Brandy's sophomore album sounds like it should have been her debut album. I would think that hittng the scene with her first album as hard as she did and then blowing up with her hit TV show, she would have been banging on her latest album. I'm sorry to say but if her competition gets with the right producers and promoters Brandy will be out the singing buisness quick! She can't keep depending her good looks to get her by, because like her or not, she can not sing so her songs/music needs to be able to divert that attention somewhere else and they're not!"
1,what happen after the first record?,the songs are to predictable and her voice has lost what little edge it had.and what's up with doing everything i do i do for you? it was weak when bryan adams did it and it is weaker now.and the most overrated song the boy is mine from last year.
2,Simply Magical,"This album is classic. Its an album which can listen to from the first track all the way to the last. Brandy worked her magic on this album. As she said, she didn't feel like recording another album after her debut because she wanted to concentrate on her acting, but boy am I glad she had a change of heart.If you don't have this album in your collection, you are missing out."
2,Too bland and unoriginal plus horrible vocals,Brandy wasnt bringing anything new to the MI when she released this album back in 1998. Its got some ok songs but could have been better. But then again she was only 19 and this was here sophomore album. What makes the CD worse is her bad vocals. Can u understand what shes saying in 'the boy is mine'? She should have took more singing lessons but then again that wont help if u just cant sing. Actually I dont see how she got a record deal in the first place but anyways. Save your money and buy mya's CD instead.
1,What is going on with your NOSE?,"Your nose is so FLAT that I have a hard time finding it. Your music is AWEFUL and your personality is LIttle, Just like your NOSE NOSE NOSE NOSE"
4,"Brandys cd is very inspiring ,I love it!!","Girl uou are on top of the world! I just wanted to say that your album is very inspiring.My reason for this is I just broke ^ with my boyfriend when I bought your cd and it helped me get through it, not knowing why. the two that helped me most are ""have you ever"" because I really liked and still like him and he couldn't understand that and I think the other one is called ""tommorrow"" and I have no idea why this song did but it did.All in all I want to say I love your music !!! LOVE,very inspired,(TYFFANIE)"
5,BRANDY'S CD IS GREAT SHE HAS GROWN SO MUCH SINCE HER LAST CD,"BRANDY'S CD HAS TOUCH ME SO MUCH IN THE WAY THAT MOST OF THE SONGS THAT SHE SINGS IS HITTING THE NAIL RIGHT ON THE HEAD ESPECIALLY ANGEL IN DISGUISE THAT WAS SO CLOSE TO HOME. ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS, BRANDY YOU HAVE GROWN SO MUCH SINCE THE LAST CD AND I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU AND THANX SO MUCH FOR SINGING THINGS THAT RELATES TO THE AVERAGE TEEN"
3,She's good..... just not perfect,"I think she is a good singer, her style is different then others. I don't believe that it is because she can't sing, because someone would have told her by now. I think Brandy has a good attitude and outlook on life. I like her as a person, not so much as a singer."
4,Brandy Percolates,"The best tracks on this album explore the darker sides of love, and get you moving! Recommended: ""Angel In Disguise"", ""The Boy Is Mine"", ""Learn The Hard Way"", ""Almost Doesn't Count"", ""U Don't Know Me"", ""Have You Ever"", and ""One Voice"". Great cruising music!!"
5,This CD is soooo Hot!!,Brandy's latest CD is so good and I think everyone should pick it up!! She has some great tracks that make you want to dance and some ballads that make you reminisce and think of a loved one..Brandy has definitely grown in the last 4 years and her new album shows..It's definitely worth the money!
4,Better than her first,"I liked Brandy's second album a lot better than her first. The two years or so that it took to release the album was pretty worth it. I like all of her songs except that Bryan Adams remake. She could've done without that. But other than that, it was great."
3,"It was good, but not great.","Some of the songs like ""The Boy Is Mine"", ""Happy"", and ""Top Of The World"" are good, but the aren't very many up-tempo songs."
3,Brandy's new albulm isn't worth $16.00.,"About five of the songs were really hot and I couldn't keep my ears off the speakers, but the rest of the abulm was toally wack!"
5,I'm so surprised!,"I live in Sweden, and Brandy isn't really that big up here. So when I recently visited New York and got her latest CD as a gift I was a little disappointed. But Brandy really surprised me! I rarely find albums with more than three or four songs that I really like, and even though I don't love every single song on 'Never Say Never'...well...I'm still giving it five stars!"
3,Brandy's cool but she needs some new material,"I think that Brandy's a nice girl. her videos are kid-safe, she has a very pretty voice, and according to talk shows and such that I've seen that are interviewing her, she's a pretty decent person, too.But her songs are exactly alike! Have You Ever and Boy is Mine are the only songs that sound somewhat different than the rest on the album. Not much of a CD to buy for songs to actually pay attention to,it's pretty much only good if you are reading or are relaxing and you want a CD to help you unwind."
5,Brandy is at her best,This is called never say never and what a title for an album because never say brandy can't bounce back and make a terrific follow up to her first album.
3,nice tunes and voice,"Brandy's album is ok with smooth voice, nice tunes and easy to listen to...not the dance R&B album that you may be looking for, but goes down smooth"
5,I think the new CD is great.,"Brandy's new CD is the best one ever. I like the way she included Monica in,""That boy is mine."" I think they should do more duets together a lot more often. Way to bring the n****z out in check girl!! Two thumbs up on that video!!! P.S. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.."
3,Brandy's sophmore effort is a soulful improvement,"Despite some languid, badly orchestrated numbers, Brandy's silky new CD NEVER SAY NEVER is soulful, entertaining pop. It may get bashed by lots of critics and it may not be the bravest album of '98 but as a sophmore record, Brandy demonstrates she'll be around for a while. Best cuts: ""The Boy is Mine"" and ""Top of the World."""
4,Brandy's Best CD....so far,"No doubt, this is Brandy's BEST CD ever. This cd still gets played by me and others I know. Granted, Brandy is not the strongest vocalist but she does have a tone and a style of singing that will knock anybody out. Beyonce could learn a thing or two from Brandy on how to CONTROL your vocals. The best songs on this cd are ""Angel In Disguise"", ""Almost Doesn't Count"", ""Never Say Never"" and ""Tommorrow"". She even does a fine job on Bryan Adam's classic ""(Everything I Do) I Do It For You"". I hope Brandy's new cd is better than this one. If not, I will continue to play this one/"
5,The girl can sing. This cd is all you expect and more...,Every song on the cd is great. She has really matured.
2,Why the hype??,"Brandy is not that great of a singer to be crowned 'diva'.Not by a LONG SHOT!! she is an average singer AT BEST, and if the music & production weren't good, this Cd would be in the bargain bin NOW.Some of the songs are Ok, but you get tired of Brandy's voice cracking & not holding notes.I prefer Monica and Faith for the 'future of R&B' over Brandy and Mary J.Blige.Brandy, your tired smile will only carry your career SO far.Please go back to TV, and get a new hairdo!!"
5,A true work of art.,"I really like Brandy and Monica's albums but I would have to say Brandy's is the better choice. She did take four years to bring us this album, true but I prefer the maturity she's gained during this time. All 14 songs represent an innocent but heartfelt, sensual but not sexual young woman. My favorite songs are every song. This album has sold over 5 million copies to date and I wish it great success to sell even more. Brandy has proved herself. GET THIS CD!"
1,Never Say Never. Right.,"I really don't care for this. I bought it, thinking I'd love it cuz I loved her first CD. I only like ""The Boy is Mine"" (cuz Monica's in it) and ""Sittin' on top of the World"". Don't waste your money. (By the way, I really hat that song ""Have You Ever"")."
1,SHE CAN'T SING!!!!!,"First of all, I don't understand how she got this far in the first place. It must be who you know and how much money you got. I found it totally disrespectful that she would even compare her coarse congested voice to that of Whitney Houston's. For the love of humanity, stop singing. Big ups to her song writers and music producers who managed to at least allow you to enjoy the music."
3,"Brandy's the BOMB,BABY!!!!","Brandy rocks as a singer,but as a actress she seriously needs help!!But my fave song is ""Have you ever?""...Brandy,we love you as Brandy but you suck as Moesha!!"
2,Stick with your day-job (acting)!!,"Brandy, I don't mean to hate on you boo,but you haft to know in order for you to sing there has to be a vocal range something to compensate this album as a whole. I think the ""RADIO READY"" (Top of the World, Angel in Desguise) tracks are just that radio ready, you show no emotion or issues in your songs. On the other hand your acting ability is amazing I support every thing you do in that respect. In your first album you really took the door of the henge. I wanna be down and broken-hearted were my favorites. But I think that Monica is a more GOD-Given talent than you are and that should be evident even though you are marketed better than Monica."
2,it is alright,"I am not a Brandy fan but, I am not goin to bad mouth her. I think you should but Monica's album instead. This is alright but, it is not as real life and meaningful as Monica's CD. But it was not as bad as I thought it would be. Bye it if you want."
4,Brandy Does It Again!!!,"I just picked up the new Brandy cd, Never Say Never. And i must say i am plesantly surprised at Brandy's latest musical offering. I will admit in the beginning i listened to the project with a critical ear. But the music is good through the whole cd. her lyrics have mutured with her also.The only problem i have with it,is she does not open her mouth to sing on a regular basis, like she does on songs like Have you ever,One voice, and the emotionally ballad, Tomorrow. Her producers Rodney and Fred Jerkins really deserve a lot of credit for the music, If nothing else this will go down as one of their best musical projects. As much as I respect Monica, her cd lacks the consistant flow of good tracks that the Jerkin's brothers have done for Brandy.even though Brandy's voice is not as talented as Monica's,Brandy work's with what she has."
4,well i think brandy is very talented and it shows in herwork,i really wish she would stop trying to act so innocent
5,This cd is still in my cd player today!,"Brandy's sophomore album Never Say Never is simply amazing. It's almost perfect but of course most of everything has its hits N' misses. Brandy second cd displays maturity and very heart-felt songs such as; ""Tomorrow"" & ""Have you Ever"". It is without a doubt that I label this album as her BEST and honestly the best of contemporary R&B;, yet.It is very exciting to know that Brandy penned most of the album's song, so not only is she a gifted singer, actress but she's a gifted songwriter as well. This cd will forever remain in my ipod and disc changer.Top Tracks:Tomorrow (My favorite R&B; ballad-vocally she's amazing on this song)Angel in DisguiseHave you everU dont know me (Like you used to)This cd needs to be in every Brandy and R&b; lover collection"
3,Good look at Politics,"A look at the Right, the Left and everything in between. Pretty good documentary that allows you to think for yourself. The scene with Pat Robertson was hilarious and worth watching for that alone. That man always seems to be saying something strange and just plain off the wall.Hoffman does a good job of interviewing people and asking questions. This is definitely worth watching."
2,Inexpensive but not durable.,"This Maxtor 160GB hard drive worked pretty well for about one year. The speed was good and the storage space was a good value for the money. However, the drive started braking down just one month after the warranty expired. Whenever I turned it on, it started to screech extremely loudly. After a while, many of the files became unreadable. If all you need is cheap temporary storage, this hard drive may be a good deal. On the other hand, I suggest you look somewhere else for reliable, long-term file storage."
5,Absolutely Beautiful,"A definite must for those who savor story over system. Nobilis builds a lovely world and then opens it to any sort of story you might want to run. It requires imagination and maturity, but the payoff is worth it.The rules are a bit loose in terms of direct conflict and damage, but I have not found this to detract much from the these sorts of scenes. Rather they allow for more descriptive battles and the like, and allow non-physical characters to take a role in them as well.All in all a well done book and *very* entertaining game."
4,This book abducted me,"I was really amazed to see this book, and it's sequel, the Eternity Gene, were written by my professor from seminary. I took a course on writing from him back then. The plot and story telling really caught me up into the world he created. Very fascinating. As anohter reviewer wrote, I enjoyed how Hughes takes us on a tour of so many fascinating scenes, and strings them together. It has a ""you are there"" effect on the reader."
5,"Very good, well worth reading!",This book is for those people who doubt the existince of god. It also gives you instite if you ever get into a theological arguement.
4,Thrilling tale that makes you think,"Hughes makes some startling accusations in his book, THE FALLEN. A must read for any conspiracy enthusiast."
1,Its cheap and so is the price,It broke with in 1 week but it cost me under $2.00. You get what you pay for.
4,Good Collection of American Poetry,"Goes up to the middle of the 20th C. (Has Sandburg and Stevens but not Ginsburg and Giovanni).A nice volume that I refer to often, packs a thousand pages and fits in my hand. Nicely portable for so much text. Organized in chronological order of poets' dates of birth."
3,Good Beginners book,"If you have never programmed in VB than this is a great introduction to the VB and .NET. If you are a programmer, this is probably not the book you want. It is VERY VERY basic. There is no real life code examples.Good for it's humor but not technical enough for a seasoned programmer."
1,I'm an idiot... and this is garbage!,"This is the worst book I have ever read. It' s like reading a book on how to use a light switch over and over again even though you've already done it 1000 times. Does that make sense? Either way, I'm drunk and this book sucked and I still can't program. What a waste. Good lord."
3,Amazing illustrations let down by the words,"Perhaps it's just me, but I found the words in this version to be unusually stuffy. I really appreciated the ideas behind the way the story was told, but the words sounded too much like they had come from another world for me to enjoy them as much as the illustrations. The illustrations were mesmerising, beautiful and thoughtful. I loved the fact that more unusual animals were chosen, and the different perspectives on life inside the ark, and during the making of the ark."
5,A young man finding his place in India,"I could identify with the main character as he completed his studies and began moving into the 'real' world. His spiritual journey, though not complete at the books end, was very interesting. The (paraphrased) line ""they thought they were the first of their type and the last.."", referring to his radical friends from his university days, struck a chord. We all slowly realize that our own well-used mold was indeed not broken after they made us. More followed. Alas, we all take our place in society and make the best of it.Simply written and easy to read. I recommend it."
4,A great and multi-faceted novel,"Narayan has accomplished an amazing feat. He has used language to illustrate the process of a man's soul searching, while, at the same time, questioning the nature of language itself. The book's prose is beautiful, clean, and coherent for western readers while at the same time giving a good and keen sense of south-east asian culture. The epiphany this story's lead character experiences when transcending death to communicate with his wife is an amazing reading experience."
5,a descriptive interpretation of Beethoven's eroica,"It is Sir John's one of the finest recordings. Holy John(a nickname given by Vaughan Williams) would have prefered to conduct an Elgar Symphony in his final concert, but strangely like Bernstein or Henry Wood, Barbirolli himself concluded his career with a Beethoven Symphony. Under Barbirolli's baton the first movement becomes much more realistic and broader than any other conductor.The second movement, the funeral march, is a scream for the hero, where Barbirolli broadens the tempo to create an impressing effect. In the last movement Sir John, as if climbing to Mount Everest, slowly brings the piece to a heroic end. With its enormous ups and downs and its beatufilly interpreted second movement(18.22min.) this CD should not be missed."
5,Awesome dish,This dish is Awesome! So easy to clean! I wish I had bought one a LONG time ago. Seems very durable. I've had it for months and it is holding up well.
3,perfect,"These are the perfect straps for any use. Although the picture shows yellow, I received green ones, but hey I'm not color coding anything."
3,Western Volume 3,"This DVD has 4 Full-Lengh episodes of old time TV western all in Black /White no color . 1. Gene Barry ""Bat Masteron - Stampede at the Tent City 2. Gail Davis ""Annie Oakley""- ""Shadow at Sonoma"" 3. Duncan Renaldo ""The Cisco Kid"" - Ghost Story 4. Clayton Moore ""The Lone Ranger - The Lone Ranger Fights on. If you like old time TV western this DVD is for you. There is not mush elso to say about this DVD."
3,R was way better.,"Although I'm a huge Sailor Moon fan I didn't really like the last movie. I didn't like the story as much as the first 2. If your a true blue fan I would say go for it but if you aren't into Sailor Moon, you might want to stay away."
4,Super S Movie,"Well, I personally thought this was a great movie. It is certainly for younger kids or Chibi-Moon fans(me! me! me! ^-^) The scouts battle with bon-bon babies(that are soooo cute, even though they're evil), evil dream fairies, and a evil witch named Badiyanu(hey I know it's spelled wrong but I tried!). I have to say it's a must for all Moonies!"
3,Not the best......,"I think Hearts of Ice and Promise of the Rose are much better than this. The plot is too close to the Pied Piper. It's kind of boring, too."
4,Sub-GOOD! Dub-BAD!,"The dubbed/Editided version ......!However the Subtitled version ROCKED!....... Even my sister, who LOVES Sailor Moon, HATED the Dubbed/Edited version. I did to! Do yourslf a favor and: GET THE SUBBED,FORGET THE DUB! They practictly ruined this movie in english but the best part about the dubbed version was the original voices were in. But, I don't see why they cut out the swearing. Popolan (Doesn't that sound funny?!?) got mad at Sailor Uranus and Sailor Mars and he said ""Damn You!quot;, and they cut this out!(DUMB DiC), And Peruru got this world practicly blown up and he said""Dammit!!!"", and they maid him say ""Darn"" 'Darn'?Hello Pioneer The world is being blown up DUH! Overall... THE SUB ROCKED!6"
3,Wait for DVD!!!!,"Hey Sailormoon fans, if you really can't decide if you want to get the subbed version or the dubbed version of these movies, might I suggest waiting a few months for the DVD that will come out? Then you get the best of both worlds! Rankings of the movies (which I own already): Sailormoon R: Quite really the best of all three, the most dramatic and heart-wrenching Sailormoon S: Good light story ... great to see all the Outer Senshi use their powers and Luna turn into a Human! Sailormoon Super S: Really very sweet and saccharine. Great for younger fans who like Chibi-usa. SHows off different attacks, but the plot line is not original at all."
5,The Best Wick Sailor Moon Movie,"This is the most and coolest Sailor Moon Movie ever to be made. This movie has all the qualities to make a movie great. It has action, adventure, romance(love), comady, and mystery. This is the best Sailor Moon Movie because it has all the Inner Sailor Scouts in it and Tuxedo Mask, The Cats Luna, Artemis, and cute Diana, and the return of the Outer Sailor Scouts Pluto, Neptune, and Uranus(No Saturn). It has action fighting those Bon Bon Baddies. It has emotion when they take Sailor Chibi Moon away. This movie also it very will drawn better then the other movies and seeing the girls when they were little. The beginning theme and of course the Flute Music. If you are a Sailor Moon Moonie buy this movie right away I know I am and maybe DiC will make an UNedit dub feature. Buy this movie right away! !"
2,buy it 'cuz its sailor moon not 'cuz its a good movie,this movies sucks for older SM viewers although for little kids its ok though parents may want to wait for the dub 'cuz most little kids can't read sub-titles.
1,Not as good as the first 2,"They say you should never waste your money on the third movie. That fits with this movie. I loved the first two but found myself bored with this one. If you really want it, get it. If you aren't sure, don't."
5,Lighten Up!!!,"People please lighten up on the dubbed versions of the Sailor Moon movies!! Do you know how hard it is to keep a Japanese storyline and translate it to American and still keep it clean so Pioneer won't get calls from people being offended?! Actually watch the dubbed movie with a great attidute and you'll be surpised on how good it is! And about the voice acting. Its actually top notch, and yes I'm talking about the dubbed! Actually be glad that the voice acters take their time to make these movies so we can see them over here in the US! By the way, this isn't the review section of the Subtitled movie. Write a review on the product that you actually saw!!"
3,is good movie but....,this is a good movie don't get me wrong but if you want to watch the movie wait till the one dubbed in english is out....unless you want to read it and miss all the actionit is a very good movie for little girls i know my daughter watches it and has all 3 movies 1 english and 2 japanese
2,Not Very Good,This was the worst Sailor Moon movie I've ever seen. The plot needed alot of work. They need better charictor's. And didn't the acting seem a little bad after all the better acting job's they did with the last movie's? I won't be buying the dubbed version of this movie because if Pionear can mess up the best of the movies (Sailor Moon R) they will make a mistake with this one.
1,This moive bits,"This moive bits majorly. I hate it, of corse Mini Moon is one of my least favorite characthers, & that is who is moive is all about. Mini Moon this & Mini Moon that. Also I hate the voices they gave the outers. Uranus is high & squeaky, the total oppisite to the t.v. show. The plot line was ok, but the way the did it was bad. It was all Mini Moon. They chould have given some of the otheer Sailors more imortant roles. I just hate it."
3,A special place in my heart....,"This was the first of SM in Japanese I ever saw. I saw it several yrs ago so it'll always have a special place in my heart. However from a critical point of view I think it's one of the worst things to come out of the SM series as a whole. The first two movies are better. If you've only see this movie from the SuperS series, trust me, the television series is a thousand times better!!! See ""Moon Gorgous Meditation"" in it's natural form with out Chibi-Usa (no offense to Chibi fans. I love her to death myself but the movie version of the attack is disappointing compared the the T.V. version). Trust me! If you love the movie you'll be blown away by it's television counterpart."
4,Justice to SuperS,"Yes, I know this is the famously dubbed worst of the 3. However it has some good value points! Like: the outers. They barely said two words in the S movie! (""Oh no, they interupted our coffe! And it was such GOOD coffe. Guess it's time to fight."") I swear, they barely said any more than their transformation words... ^^;; However in this movie, I feel they are given more justice, including an awsome attack sequence! (Gotta love them space sword and mirror! ^_~*) So bear through the Chibi Usa oh-so-sugery cuteness. Once you take out the sappy stupid parts (like for me, the entire middle [apartment - confronting Peruru]) seriously, this is one cool movie. Oh yeah, and probably one of my driving purposes for getting the movie: ""Keeping them children forever? That's terrible!"" ""I agree. There are some things only adults could enjoy..."" Blush, cough, and look the other way. Classic!"
5,Sailor Moon Super S is the best!,This is the best movie out of the 3 dubbed ones! If you never seen the Japanese version of this and the SuperS episodes there is so much new for you to see! The evil Badiyanu has come to capture all the children to gain power for her Black Dream Hole.It is located in the middle of her castle. When she finds that Chibi/Mini-Moon has great power that would assist her she kidnapps Rini and the other children. Will Sailor Moon save Rini and the other children or will Badiyana prevail and draw the earth into the eternal Dream Vortex? Find out in this really wicked cool film!
3,R was better,"even though this was a good movie, sailor moon R and s were Alot better. But everyone has to see it. someone's kidnapping children, and who is peruru? but the transformations were the same or stupider, and they could have done better with sailormoon's and chibimoon's attack. a good thing is you get to see Mars jupiter venus and mercury's new attacks. i've got to go.^_^"
1,sigh........,"Another messed up sailormoon movie. This wasn't the best but the dub will be worse. The true Sailormoon will be lost and dub will take over. Usagi will fade away and Serena, the retarded valley girl, will take over. Horrible lines willl be added, and cute lines will be left out. We'll here the awful voices, and messed attacks. Get the subtitled version and keep the TRUE sailormoon living."
3,My Review,"I think the video is ok, but I liked the Hearts on Ice video better. Pretty soon, hopefully I'll get the Doom Tree Series, for sleepovers and such. The movie talks about Rini, Sailor Mini Moon. She and others get kidnapped by the evil queen Virandu. It shows all outer and inner scouts, except Sailor Saturn. its a cool video if your kid likes sailor moon and enchantment."
3,It was okay...,"When the movie ended, I said to myself, ""that's it??"" It wasn't as good as the first two in terms of the storyline. Just keep in mind that I watched the dubbed version of Super S and S, and the subtitled version of R. But the animation sequences are beautiful. Look for the one part that shows Serena/Sailormoon crying, and you will know what I mean. Again, the only complaint I have about this movie is that story isn't as moving as the first two, but if you watch the subtitled one, maybe it will be better. I don't know, my only recommendation is to watch both subbed and dubbed versions of each movie and let you decide. My understanding is that the DVD's contain both versions (I think?), so watch the subs for the uncut and original version, and the dubs for a varied and a sometimes even better version."
4,Sailor Moon is a fantastic story for any age.,"I know it's not much to say, but I'm a 21 year old male and I love Sailor Moon. My parents told me I would leave this phase, but they're wrong. (Besides, I think 10 years of the same Star Trek/Sailor Moon/anime phase is long-lasting to prove it.)All I can really say about the movie is watch it subbed and not dubbed. Sailor Moon rules.Ash Tindal"
3,This Movie............,This movie was great for Rini fans. I thought that this was okay to me but my lil' cousin loved it (even though i had to read the subtitles to her). It is more of a kids story but great to see the outer scouts do their thing since in North America we don't get to see them in action. This movie seems to shoot towards the younger crowd but all-in-all it was a good movie.
3,Overall Good Movie,"This is the first SailorMoon movie I bought after seeing the subtitled version. I bought SailorMoon R and S without seeing the subbed versions and I was very pleased with them. I noticed that there were scenes added in the the dub in order to remove certain scenes that are 'not suitable' for younger audiences (i.e. The sailor scouts glow in their auras while being nude after their suits are taken away. Glowing Barbie dolls.) The story is kept the same if compared to the dub but, the original music was replaced by the DIC music which turned out to be somewhat of a dissapointment."
4,read this,this movie was good and i think it was the best of the 3 movies but i think that evil candies is a litle rediculous
2,Sailor Moon R was better....,"Eh.. Me and my friends saw it and it was ok... there was no real plot (well there was, but it was pretty pointless) It's kind of like Little Nemo...in some weird way. The best part was probably when the outers came to help the inners. and when Chibi Usa gives Perutu a kiss at the end :) that was cute. Perutu or whatever has cool wings at the end! (is it just me or does he kind of resemble Helios in his human form?)"
3,It was ok....,"I got this video for a Christmas gift. I'm a huge fan of all Sailor Moon things, but this movie could have been better, I admit. The animation and special effects were beautiful, but the whole plot line was not clear and rather... confusing. I would say that if you like Sailor Moon and if you are a huge fan of anime, get this video, but, see the other two videos first."
4,Chibi-Usa's movie spotlight,"The most endearing features of Sailor Moon are the 2000 yr romance between Usagi (Serena) and Mamoru (Darien) and the close friendships of the Sailor Scouts. Recognizing that these themes will be lost on younger fans, this movie appeals to kids in a manner that captures their imagination (my 4 yr old daughter wants to BE Chibi-Usa!). Its themes include the value of friendship, family, and unconditional love. Because of the younger target audience, I don't compare this movie directly to the others (R and S). It stands on its own merits as Chibi-Usa's turn in the movie spotlight, and will warm your heart each time you watch it."
1,HORRIBLE,"for christmas i asked for the subtitled version of the sailormoon super S movie... but i ended up getting the dub. i already have the R and S movie in subtitles and I have seen all of sailor stars in subtitles... now i have not even seen the japanese version of this movie and i know that it must be sooo much better than the english. for one, noticeable cuts were in the english... rini( chibiusa) wakes up just from sailormoon holding her. i am pretty sure they cut something from that part. and when the sailor senshi lose their powers suddenly they just disappear from the movie? plus the same old music kept repeating over and over and that ruins everything... plus the japanese intro was replaced by a lame english opening. i have to admit the dubbing was ok even though they changed all the conversations, i wouldn't have minded the dub if they left in the original japanese BGM, the intro and the scenes they cut out."
5,Moon Prysim Power,"Much like Sailor Moon S, Sailor Moon Super S is based upon the Japanese manga Sailormoon. The English version of the film will more than likely be edited to clarify certain tings. Also, the opening sequence (Dance of the 3 O'clock Fairy) will more than likely be changed as it was in the dubbed versions of R and S. Not that this makes the English version inferior, it keeps it on par with the English series...which never got around to explaining how Uranus, Pluto or Neptune came to be sailor scouts (sailor senshi) or Diana, the daughter of Luna and Artemis fits into the picture. I own the Japanese version of this film and I am awaiting the English one as well. The sailor series has always been about the love of friends and the power that exists between them and Sailor Moon Super S does not disappoint"
1,Yikes!,"Words of warning to all Sailor Moon fans; do not watch the subtitled edition of this movie before watching this one! Truly, DiC has hacked this story apart. I bought the S-T'ed one first, since I really wanted to see this, and I absolutely loved it. For Christmas this year, I recieved the dubbed version of it, and I nearly died while watching! So much is lost in the translation! They cut out a part where Usagi spanks Chibi-Usa, (she raises her hand to hit her, and magically she awakens), and the baking part in the beginning just didn't make sense anymore. Do yourself a favor and get the S-T'ed one, not the dubbed. Unless, of course, you collect them like me and/or just want to hurl dull objects at your TV."
3,SaliorJupiter thunder girl,Ijust recently bought this movie. I liked this movie but it could have been better.Some of the stuff they say is pretty corny.In my opion they could have included the other scouts more.If your a real saliormoon fan then you should get this movie.As you can see in my title that i'm a SaliorJupiter fan I like all the scouts but she's the best one in my opinion.
5,My 2nd fav!,"This movie is the best! The only reason it's my 2nd best is because Promise of the Rose has the coolest song at the end! This movie has action, adventure, and (My fav part) Pluto, Uranus, Neptune, and Chibi-Moon! If you like anime, then you'll just loooove this one!"
4,A must have for all Sailormoon fans!!!,"This is a movie that is a must have if you're a Sailormoon fan. It has all the quality that makes Sailormoon different from other animation. You get your cool transformations and powers, your laughs, your romance, your seriousness, your evil villian, etc.This movie catches your eyes every so often, but tends to be slow at times. So if you're a fan, it's a must have."
3,Super S? Just Plain S is Better! By Chibi Rose,"Super S is a movie only for hard core Sailor Moon fans, like me, but even I thought that it was a bit boring... I liked the dubbed version of S better! (I haven't seen the undubbed of any of the others.) I personally like this movie for the wonderful animation. Especially in the end when- oh, I won't say! But it's a pretty good movie for all the Moonies... I personally recommend S, but if ya haven't seen this one yet, you probably should... OK, I'll quit jabbering now, it's overall a good movie, better if you're a moonie, but I think S is better. Nuff said?"
4,"If you hate Chibi-Usa/Rini, then only rent it for one scene!","If you hate chibiusa/rini, then only rent this to see how Usagi/Serena wakes her from the hypnosis. Other than that the movie it good!"
5,This is a woderful movie!,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! It was a perfect way to end the SuperS season! Although the subtitled version does have minor cussing in it,it is still good for kids! Recemended for any Sailor Moon fan. A movie you don't want to miss!"
3,Not one of Naoko's best works,"The SuperS movie is different than the past two in various ways. Its animation is absolutely beautiful and the artwork is also. Yet, the plot is very weak and unoriginal. I don't think that the entire storyline about capturing childrens' dreams for sugar energy is much different from the plots of the series. It does have some funny parts where Usagi and Chibi-Usa quarrel, and when Usagi frequently ditzes out. I don't reccommend this movie over the other two. I suggest only buying it if you are a serious BSSM fan."
2,Uncut is better,"I think this Sailor Moon movie might be the worst of the three, mainly because it's based on little kids and cookies and candy...yeah, okay, it's still a good movie on the most part, especially if you're really bored and nedd to pass the time.I bought the Geneon Signature Series version of this movie, meaning that it wasn't edited to the point of sheer insanity...it's just the pure uncut Japanese version. Of course, there is an English version, but the dialogue and voices are so screwed up I can't stand to watch it for more than 5 seconds. Unless you're a 7-year-old, don't get the whacked out edited version and go for the uncut..."
4,Good opening scenes,In this DVD the scouts must rescue the children who Lady Badiyanu has kidnapped. The story is good and the quality of the picture is great. Awesome intro scenes. Recommended for all the Sailor Moon fans.
4,Two feelings,"The video gave me two feelings since i ordered both versions:The sublited version two swear words. When Perureu couldn't get the ship going he sweared and Puplan (or however you spell it) swear when the Sailor Scouts defeated his partners. again there was a scene where Tuxedo Mask got hit, was fallen to the ground, he got up he got hit, went flying in the air, and smacked against the ship and peeled off the ship. Then Mini moon screamed. Also there was a part where the Sailor Scouts where losing their transformation and it wasnt for kids.The part where Tuxedo mask got smacked against the ship was cut in the dubbed version and the part where the sailor scouts lost their transformation was cut. The smacked against the ship was cut because of voilince and the transformation part because they looked like they had no clothes on. Te swear words didnt appear."
3,"Not too great, but entertaining.","The story was not very original or interesting, and the script was tacky. The thing that kapt me going was watching the transformations and attacks, some of which I had never seen before. The music was the worst part, some of it elevator music, some of it horribly kiddy and happy. Fun, but not worth seventeen bucks."
4,A must see for the Chibi-moon fan,"I don't really like Chibi because in the begining of the Sailor Moon R series she is really annoying. But in this movie, Rini is Sailor Chibi-moon in it. (She's not that annoying when she changes.) But, she stars in it more than she usually does. Anyway, her character is nice in this one. There is also a cute, little, boy in it whose name is Peruru. I like his character."
4,It's a cute movie,"Although I loved this movie, many people don't like it. Why? Because it revolves around Chibi-Usa, Sailormoon's daughter, who is a bit of a brat. In this movie, Chibi-Usa falls in love with a fairy, and all that cute stuff...this movie has the romantic aspects of the Sailormoon S movie, and it has a lot of awesome scenes that made it definitely worth it (Outer Senshi appearance, and of course the Mamoru dream). I know most young Sailormoon fans will love it, but the older ones should steer toward the other two movies. (One last thing: Pupuran is a HOTTIE! ^_^)"
2,"In the words of Angry Kid....""Stinky""","For the most part, this movie was a lot like the Dic dub. Whether or not that's good is up to personal choice. Personally, that's a minus for me. I was, however, impressed that they kept the Japanese song ""Sanji No Yousei,"" the song that the kids sing, in the movie. I also liked hearing the original voice cast again. If not for Terri Hawks, I doubt I would have liked this as much as I did. Even still, they added a lot of dopey Dic music and that was the least enjoyable part for me. I would not recommend this movie for a fan of the Japanese ""Sailor Moon."" This is more suited to kids and American dub fans."
3,Not the best sailor moon,"welll i have three of the movies and one season of sailor moon and i have to say reni is not very cute in this movie, not cute at all in fact she's very annoying! And she is like in love with Darien, not family love either. If rini hasn't noticed he is her dad that is total grossness!!!! sorry but really that is really wrong pepl"
1,Dissapointed,"Ordered white - they send me beige twice. I appreciate the response in sending me the wrong item the second time. But it was still wrong and they did not figure this out. I can not use what they send me, any one need some beige luggage clips?"
1,Dead by 2 hours,"Dead by Dawn goes up and down, but is distressingly intolerable; after you have invested 2 hours of your life on it, it takes a nose dive into absolute nonsense.I think this was meant to be or should have been serio-comic slasher, but most of the ""murders by the vengeful soul"" scenes were consigned to the cutting room floor with the consequence of a very unbalanced and too cliched effort."
5,"Worth the ""ka-ching"".","This stuff is really expensive, but, in my experience, worth the price. It smells nice, it detangles dry hair (that is, you don't have to wet hair to use it), and it brings out sheen. I use it on knots and tangles when brushing my 5 year old daughter's long hair and save myself many minutes of her crying and pleading to ""leave me alone!"" Now that we have ""the green stuff"" (Fiorvanti No-Rinse Detangler in a green bottle), she and I can get her hair brushed with far less pain and drama. Since the detangler is so effective, we use it sparingly and are able to make it last for a several months before having to replace it."
3,Better than what I expected,"Katie McKay's spirit is low. She is pregnant, and both her sister and brother-in-law were killed in car crash accident. For the love of her sister who cannot conceive, she is willing to be the option mother.Enter Seth Cooper, the uncle-to-be to her baby. He is charming and both entered into a marriage of convenience because of the baby she was carrying. They vowed to take care of the baby living inside Kathy's womb. Kathy did feel that Seth was pitying on her and that makes her even more vunerable to Seth.Fateful events unfold itself one by one.. and they did fall madly in love with each other. I wouldn't say this book is a good buy neither as a waste of your money. If you want to consider for a romance after marriage, this book is a good start. I did feel the book is a bit sexy, since the hero considers Kathy who is pregnant as sexy."
5,Birdcage Storage,Purchased this to use in my scrapbook room to hold stamps and dies in CD cases. A scrapbooker can never have too much storage. It arrived in great condition and works wonderfully for what I wanted it for. I do have to have it a little further out from the wall than I wanted to be able to turn it.
5,Absolutely perplexing...A book that really makes you wonder.,"A exceptionally well written book dealing with the ever befuddling question of ""where do we come from?"" Or better yet, ""What happens if..?"". If you are a person that likes to think about such things, you will really enjoy this book. It is told in the context of a fantasy story, but the basic underlying concepts and ideas are there. A wonderfully spun story of dealing with self-discovery and with circumstances beyond control."
5,"""One of the best series I've ever read!!!""","The Gandalara Cycle I is by far one of the most captivating stories that I have ever read. I read my first S.F./Fantasy novel in the summer of 1974. I have been an avid fan of the subject ever since. This one goes at the top of the list along with stories by, McAffery, Heineline, Assimov, Tolkien and Eddings."
5,Good read!!,"I borrowed this in high school from the local YMCA library and have beeen looking for a copy to add to my collection. From what I remember , this first cycle was a lot better than ""Return to Eddarta"" and ""The River Wall"" - found at a thrift shop. Rikardon may have the insight and wisdom of an old guy nearing death but he's still a bit too sensitive and feminine (for my taste) in portrayal. Gandalara is a small world so don't think this is an epic even if the whole series is made up of seven books. It isn't written in the grand style of Tolkien nor in the grim atmosphere of Donaldson's Covenant series. It concentrates more on the personalities and how they develop as they face their tasks and learn about the world they've entered. Worth reading if you don't want anything heavy."
3,Annals of the Former World,Wordy. Reads like a novel. I was looking for more information on geology rather than reading about what Henry David Thoreau may have done or a treatise on Darwin.
5,Comment on a previous review,"After having read this book, how could the reviewer below (mitchayer@aol.com) describe the bible as the other best non-fiction he/she has ever read? Don't the processes described in Annals of the Former World prove the bible to be myth - FICTION? You gotta wonder about some folks..."
2,Lost,"I was immediately turned off by the writing style used by the author, the unexplained jargon, and the constantly shifting references to places with geologic features of interest. I'm normally a paitent reader, but I dropped this book after 30 pages. Here is one sentence from the book. ""She has almost never slept under a roof, nor can she imagine why anyone on such a journey would want or need to; she ""scopes out"" her campsites in the late-failing light with strong affection for national forests and less for the three-dollar campgrounds where you roll out your Ensolite between two trailers, where gregarious trains honk like Buicks, and Harleys on instruments climb escarpments in the night."" I found this to be very a awkward writing style. I guess the author was trying to set a mood, but I was simply at a lose to me moved by the oblique references and jerky style."
4,One of a kind,Great mix of geology and its real-world applications. Many humorous insights(eg: one of his geologists remarks that crazy people seem to live in areas with wild tectonics). I gave it four because I would have preferred a few maps to illustrate his points - words cannot really work for everything. I m sure that the author made this choice after some thought but it just did not work for me.
5,A gift for the wounded and searching spirit,This book is a grace-filled gift for surviors who are seeking to connect with God. Both the reflections and the prayers validate the wound yet free the imagination to soar to the source of healing and wholeness. I highly recommend this book!
4,absolutely underrated artist,"Succinctly, I think Heather Nova is a brilliant lyricist. She creates beautiful and magical worlds with her rich words and wafting melodies. Every time I listen to this CD I am inspired. She combines vulnerability and strength, recognizing that we all share these ups and downs in our respective lives. She is a refreshingly candid dreamer, especially in these anemic times.You won't regret this CD. Also, Oyster, which I feel is her masterpiece so far."
4,Four simple but powerfull questions,"I knew the method by web page. The book make it easy and clear. This questions apply not only to emotional options, but to any road you have to travel, make the questions and have a choice."
4,Prompt Service,Product as described. Matches the broken one perfectly. I do wish it came with a small roll of plumbers vinyl tape. I'm impressed with the build quality so far and fit and finish matching up to existing hardware.
4,An awesome soundtrack!,"I am a huge fan of Pasion de Gavilanes, the popular Latin novella on Telemundo. When I heard that a soundtrack had been released I went out and bought it. I love the songs on this CD. I am not a big cumbia fan, but the rhythm, lyrics and singing are so infectious that I couldn't resist liking them. I of course love the novella's theme song ""Fiera Inquieta,"" but the party-themed ""Raggae Cumbia,"" the addicting ""Miedo Al Amor,"" and the love song ""Sobre Fuego"" are my favorites. Pasion de Gavilanes is one of my favorite guilty pleasures, and its soundtrack is also one that I'm not ashamed to say I love. I recommend this great soundtrack to all PDG fans out there. But keep in mind that Zharick Leon -- who plays the sexy table singer-slash-dancer Rosario -- isn't the actual vocalist. The real singer's name is Angela Maria Forero."
4,Pasion de gavrilanes rules!,This is a grate CD. The Cd has 10 songs1 Fiera Inqueta2 Reggae cumbia3 Miedo al amor4 Sobre fuego5 Vete6 Paloma7 ya no te quiero8 Cara y sello9 Dulce Pesailla10 Fiera inquieta (pop)
2,"This product came in and looked fake, but the seller agreed to take it back","Did not like the look and/or the quality of the watch as it looked fake, but to give credit to this seller, there was no discussion and my money was returned immediately after the product was shipped back, so thie seller has integrity!"
5,Never Too Late by Rebecca York,"Never Too Late is a riveting story about lovers torn part in a Central American country of San Marcos. Scott O'Donnell, a young filmmaker believes that Marianna Reyes betrayed him six years ago landing him in prison where he was tortured for information that he didn't have. Marianna thought she was saving him when she seemingly betrayed him and only learned different six years later when Scott finds her again. Passion smolders under the surface of his hurt and anger, and they are betrayed again by people who want them dead. Of course this is all tied into their past and secrets they must unravel to save their lives and the life of the child they created six years before.The story is fast paced and well written, an excellent addition to Rebecca York's 43 Light Street series. I recommend it highly."
1,Not Recommended,"I bought this book recently together with the author's other book, Living and Working in New Zealand. Plenty of pages were spent on immigration procedures which are readily available from the internet and are more up to date. The author has too much British bias and, I suspect, this book was intended only for potential immigrants from UK who also might not find anything useful. Having read a lot of books on the subject,I do not recommend this book to anyone."
4,More than a romance,"This book is much deeper than a romance. Victoria Holt examines the psychological side of finding ones family. She cleverly keeps you reading and falling more and more enchanted with dear Ellen, a girl who is so innocent with such a dark past. How will she escape the Island she was in love with? I loved this book and found myself here looking for more Victoria Holt books when I had finished reading it, a little less than 1 hour ago."
5,Mmmmm....mustard...,"I originally found this at a BIG LOTS store for $1.50. I like mustard so thought it would go well with the 20 or so others in the fridge. Boy, this became my favorite. And my wifes! And she's not even a huge mustard person.When we ran out, I bought a case and started giving jars away. This stuff is the BEST on brats and other grilled sausages. Try it. You'll love it."
4,Light and fun,"Yes, this plot may not be that hard to figure out, but it's a lot of fun. Plus, it is an easy read that just flows. So if you're looking for something deep, this isn't it. If you are looking for a light, fun treat, this is it.Others I like: Whitney Gaskell, Emily Giffin, & Janet Evanovich"
3,Ho-Hum,Very light. Very predictible. This was the first Jane Heller novel I've read so I can't compare it to any of her others but I did find this one to be fairly formula. As another reviewer mentioned there is not much depth of character nor are any of them particularly sympathatic. I read to the end mostly to see if it was truly as predictible as I susspected and it was. If your looking for no something with no thinking or depth involved this is a good choice.
1,"Oh, for heaven's sakes","I brought this book on vacation to Italy - and left it there when I was done. It was that bad. The story is like a bad romance novel - very predictable and stereotypical. I didn't really like any of the characters, and the author seemed to be trying too hard to squeeze in too much stuff - the wonders and selflessness of volunteering, the Hollywood scene, and way too many mental health troubles. Sheesh. I had hopes as I neared the end that something might happen to wrap everything up, but no. It would have been more surprising and interesting if the reporter hadn't fallen in love with the celebrity, or if something had come of the chief of staff's shenanigans. I won't be recommending this book to friends, and I don't think I'll seek out any of the author's other books."
4,A whimsical movie for the whole family.,I have watched this movie since it was released in the 1980s. It is a fanciful into a little boy's dreams coming true. Don't buy this movie unless you like good entertainment for the whole family.
4,Good Classic,"I like this movie. I grew up in the 80s and 90s, so I didn't know much about the 50s. I must say this is really a great drama movie. They have some special effects on it too, which makes it a little more interesting."
5,Great Family Entertainment,"Finally, a film that can be enjoyed with the entire family present. It's a shame that it's getting harder to find solid quality entertainment that does not need tons of special effects and elaborate hype that ultimately leaves you disappointed. Treat yourself to a really special film. It is very refreshing to say the least."
5,"Mystery, magic and mischief! Funny & heartwarming!","This is just a really entertaining story, with a hint of magic! Very family safe, but not dulled down one bit! Adults will really like this movie too!"
5,Excellent family film,This is a very powerful film with an excellent message. Know what is really important in life and never give up. Patrick Swayze plays a drifter with the power to grant wishes. Swayze does a great job in this film and makes his character fairly realistic. Joseph Mazzello (The Tissue King) puts his best foot forward showing why he's cast in so many tear jerkers. I love this film and have it in my collection.
2,starts good then pancakeville,well this movie starts out exellent and one can only wonder what would happened if it staid on this track because by the end of the first half hour it becomes boring and mindless. This was very unfortunate because it started out with some great ideas but very quickly lost its way. This was very frustrating because i saw its potential.
3,A 1950's ghost-magic tale,"A mother with two sons is just facing that her husband, a flyer lost in Korea,may never return.She accidentally hits a strange free spirited drifter and their lives are changed by the result.In the end they get three wishes."
5,"Lovely, amazing, outstanding book","This book is great and teaches you how to make creative projects from ... water, flour and salt! Some objects showed by Cheryl Owen are folk, and other are very sophisticated. Dinousaurs, cornucopias, flowers, stars, butterflies and other creatures are turned into necklaces, pencil holders, hanging decorations, bowls, boxes and other projects that can be made to and by children and adults. The author give us precious ideas in how to use this fantastic a-toxic, cheap and versatile material. Buy now!"
1,Question,I was wondering the same thing. Im having trouble finding the OST of the taiwanese drama it started with a kiss. Does anybody know if this is it or where i can get the OST?
5,What It Used To Take To Win A Pulitzer Prize,Any fan of Melville's writing who has not read this seminal and still unequaled critical study and biography has sheer pleasure in store. Arvin's intelligence and immense knowledge are seamlessly matched by a writing style that is measured and seductive. Anybody reading this study without knowing jack about Melville would probably be so excited that s/he would have to rush out to buy the complete works. This book is worth whatever effort you have to invest to find a copy. The question is: why is this TRUE classic out-of-print?
2,Modernized and Reads Like a 6th Grader's Book Report,"I have always been interested in the man behind Moby Dick, one of the great works of literature, but this book gives very little insight into the man and more info about the various books he authored. If you want to know who Melville really was, skip this very limited biography and move to one that is better written and delves deeper into the life of this great author."
1,awful,"An unconventional biography, to say the least.It's as though the author wrote a bunch of rhapsodic paragraphs musing on various aspects of Melville's life and works, and then lumped them together and called them a biography.It's on this side of coherence, but only just."
2,Worst Penguin Lives biography,"I read about 20 biographies in the Penguin Lives series, and I have enjoyed almost all of them. This is the worst I've come across. The author is ponderous. I can't get through it. Many books begin in a slow and ponderous way, apparently for the author to show off his chops, and it's a bad habit that really needs to end. But this book never advances beyond the slow start. The whole book is that way. I like the concept of concise biographies, but not when the writing style makes a short book seem endless."
2,"If you want to learn about Melville, skip this one!","Heard the taped version of HERMAN MELVILLE by KarenWhite and was most disappointed in it . . . I wanted to learnmore about the life of Melville, but instead, found out verylittle about him . . . instead, I got brief summaries of severalof his books . . . and rather than encourage me to reread someof them (and read others for the first time), if anything, thisshort volume discouraged me from doing that . . . the authoreven suggests that few of his books would be worth readingtoday . . . I usually love biographies, but not this one!"
3,Mediocre Biography,"Having neither reading anything on or by Herman Melville, I found this book suitably interesting to whet my appitite for more; but overall, the narrative was not that great; Hardwick's writing is somewhat tedious and hampered by her apparent lack of expertise on the subject."
3,Pretty good stuff.,"Penthouse and Pavement is a pretty cool disc from Heaven 17. The album is in a synth pop direction. There's some really cool keyboard work throughout. The production, musicianship, and songwriting are satisfying. I don't have any favorite songs. All of them are good. The vocalist does a pretty good job, also. The lyrics to the songs are also quite interesting. They're far from just being ordinary and empty. The lyrics to ""(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang"" and ""Let's All Make a Bomb"" are examples. There is something about this album that I've always noticed, though. Some of the songs aren't very busy musically. A little more meat should have been added to them. That aside, this is still a listenable and interesting disc. It's a nice slice of synth pop. Worth a listen."
4,HI-HO!,"Also known for film soundtracks (a'la Tangerene Dream), this recording opens and closes with an electronic flurry. Betwixt are endlessly listenable tunes. I thought I died and went to 17 Heaven! Stunning!"
2,"Too general, lacks depth","Moises Naim's ""Illicit"" represents a good attempt to provide a (rather general) overview of the main types of illicit trade. Unfortunately, the book does not go beyond the overview-level. It is way too superficial and lacks depth. A disappointment..."
3,TheDon,"Interesting, but presents very little information that is not already widely known. The author's recurring ""everybody-does-it"" theme seems to reject the possibility that some cultures are much more prone than others to problematic levels of illicit activity."
3,No Footnotes,"I'm about a third of the way through the book; very provocative so far. Unfortunately, my copy has no footnotes. The notes are at the end of the chapters as you'd expect, but the numbers they reference are not in the text. Tends to complicate a serious academic reading."
4,Very good,This book gives you an insightful view of the new world (dis)order. Fact is stranger than fiction.
5,"Passionate love story set amid court intrigue, war and lush settings","I picked up Taj- and was hooked! The pictures the authour paints of court life- clothing, food, plants, palaces- in Mughal times- simply fascinating! I had to spend 5 hours in an airport and this book was the best companion. It is a love story without rival, and an intriguing glimpse into the lives of the Mughal rulers. More than well written- it drew me in and held me in it's spell til the last line. Pick it up and savour the exotic flavour and pure enjoyment of this superb historical fiction novel."
5,PS LaRue,"I thought TAJ was the most important book I've read on the subject. It is a combination of war, death, and intrigue interwoven with a compelling love story. I wish I had read this book before I visited the Taj Mahal. I'll surely remember the story when I'm again in Agra."
3,A decent read..,"This book was less historical than I had hoped for. While I enjoyed the story, I wasn't compelled to care much about the characters near the end. The end felt as if it was hastily thrown together for a quickly approaching deadline. For all the time spent on leading up to the death of Mumtaz, there was really not much discussion about the monument he built to honor her.As petty as it may seem, the typos were so distracting I had problems reading it -- some editor needs a refresher course!"
1,Don't bother to read this book,"I asked for 'Taj' for Christmas because I like historical fiction and India. This is the most disappointing book I have read in the last 2 years. It lacks detail. The characters are rather one dimensional. Very little of the politics is explained. Don't waste your money. I will be taking my copy to a used book store just to free up some space on my bookshelves.To the editors: in the day of spell check, how can a book go to print with typos? For $30 an hour, I'll read the proof and correct the mistakes. That is right...you should be paying me to find the mistakes NOT making me pay for the book then finding the errors. There is no excuse for these types of mistakes."
1,DOA timer,This timer arrived not working and following the instructions did not reveal a way to start it up. I plan to send it back
4,"Works as promised - but make sure to try the ""R"" button before returning.","I thought this item arrived DOA. Nothing would show up on the LCD screen. I plugged it in overnight thinking it might need to charge - with no change. I tried all the normal buttons on it (including the reset (RST) button) and was ready to return it. I finally used a pen to hold down the ""R"" button for a few seconds and the LCD screen finally turned on. It has been working flawlessly since then (1 month ago).It came with instructions, but I didn't see this mentioned anywhere in the instructions. If it wasn't for this initial problem I would give it 5 stars. It has excellent options, does exactly what I bought it for."
1,nice functionality but not reliable,I bought five of these and am very happy with the functionality (they're easy to program) but one of the units died within two days of delivery and a second one died within two weeks. Both times the display went blank and the timer stopped working. (Both timers were plugged in all the time.)
5,You cannot beat this for this price!,This timer is easy to program. Has numorous event times.For the price I doubt you could find a better simpiler timer.
3,Decent Digital Timer,"If you get a timer, make sure to pay for the digital timer. Mechanical timers still exist and the noise will probably drive you nuts. This timer works well, but the programing is a bit convoluted. Other digital timers I have used are far more user friendly and don't have as many button presses to prepare a 7 day 2x a day on off cycle."
4,neanderthal interrupted...,"It's still a classic, but it's just like my vhs with better quality and sound. Why didn't UNI release this DVD in it's original theatrical form? I'ld tell you what I think, but it doesn't matter. One main reason people buy DVD's is for the movies are being presented in their original form. This won't be the first time UNI has let folks down. Remember ""Q.L. season 2"" DVD? Think about it. I got this anyway because it's what they've offered and it's better than my old videotape! Still a must-have for any fan of this movie. Chill."
2,ICEMAN full screen,ICEMAN is a 4 1/2 star movie from 1984. It stars Tim Hutton and a knockout performance by John Lone. Well directed and great music. It's a very credible sci-fi and a must see BUT not if it's not in it's original panavision aspect ratio of 2.35:1. As soon as I saw it was coming out I put it on my wish list and ordered it. Now I've found out that Universal is releasing it as pan-and-scan so I immediately cancelled it. Wait until someone wises up and gives us what we want. BOYCOTT THIS RELEASE !!!!!!!
1,ASPECT RATIO 2.35,"I am hoping that Universal is releasing Iceman in it's original aspect ratio. It is releasing Colossus: The Forbin Project in pan and scan which was 2.35.If you have to have pan and scan at least do wide screen also on the disc., or do another disc release.It is a real disappointment for such good movies."
2,Seemed like a good idea,"The movie started out well and it was an interesting idea, but the farther it went the less well thought out it seemed to be. The ending didn't seem too logical, although Timothy Hutton, I believe, did a good job with his part."
2,Don't believe a word of it,"You would think from other reviews on this site that ""Iceman"" is an ""overlooked classic."" Well, they're half right, and it's NOT a classic. I hate to see a good concept spoiled, and that's exactly what happens here. A Neandrathal man, frozen alive, comes back to life in modern times (well, 1984 anyway). Great idea, bad execution. It seems whenever the screenwriter didn't know what else to do, we're served another helping of ""Important Conversation"" about whether or not the Iceman is a human being, what right they have to experiment on him, etc. Ho-hum. The interaction between ""Charlie"" and Timothy Hutton is great, but unfortunately it's too little too seldom."
1,This DVD is in Pan & Scan not Widescreen,"A very good story and movie. Ruined by releasing it in Pan & Scan. I ordered it but did not notice theversion was the chopped up ""full screen"" version. I won't even bother to send it back. It goes in the trash alongwith any movie that is not in it's original, uncut, widescreen format. What a waste of a good movie."
5,Works on American Laptops!,"Just an FYI, you can play this movie on Laptops made in the USA. I believe there are also DVD players in the USA that can play it. It will specify on the box if they play all types.This version of the movie is the greatest representation of the book! It only covers the first book though."
2,"Holistically, save your money.",The question of authenticity of the stone will never be resolved. The author does a decent job of compiling current data. Not much more.
3,ok,"wasn't what i expected. was written intelligently, but wasn't what i thought it would be. would not recommend it to anyone."
5,Mr. Bachelder,"Needed it , and amazon was the only place that had it . If you need something ,amazon has it . Thank You"
5,Tom Tom GO 720 Is the Greatest,"TomTom GO 720 4.3-Inch Widescreen Bluetooth Portable GPS NavigatorI am very happy with the purchase of this GPS. It does everything it says it will do except for the bluetooth connection to a phone. I have the Motorola Razer and have the Bluetooth connection on but the GPS doesn't see it. If that's the only problem, then I don't have a problem."
3,Works fine,"I can use it one other components that use mini-USB connections as well, like my cell phone and blue tooth headset."
1,Tom Tom One,"I love the Tom Tom One, but the instructions stink.You literally have to figure it all out for yourself.PLUS, I paid more for the case than it costs now, because I pre-ordered it before it came out. Amazon recommendation with the Tom Tom.5 stars for the device, one star for the directions that come with it."
2,Would not purchase again,"We purchased this because my wife's TomTom did not come with a home charger. I think we have only used it once. TomTom GPS devices come with a car charger and, being a GPS, that is where you use them. I find no need to have a home charger since you can just plug it into your car. If I had the chance, I would go back and have not purchased this item. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with it, it works great. There is just no need for it."
1,Bad sound,"I have the LPs. I think that they sound better (of 50's) than this CD. It is a pity that Kostelanetz never got a good sound, but the orchestra was OK"
4,best cypress album yet,"Cypress Hill dropped their first record over 10 years ago, and the year is now 2002 and they are still making tight music. Stone Raiders is the best Hill record of them all; they have developed such a dope style over the years, and this is so apparent in the songs on this cd.CH has always been about the hardcore style, and they have added the rock element to the mix in recent years. However, the production is still hip hop as is B Real's flow, and that to me is keeping it real but adding another phat element to the package. These guys just can't make a bad song.The whole album flows from one track to the next...not something you can say about many groups out there. Usually 2 good songs and ther rest of the disc is garbage. Not so with Cypress Hill.I love Southland Killers as well as the song with Red and Meth. Yo, go get this..."
3,It's alright,"DJ Muggs has been known for his awsome producing and his new styles, easily one of the best in the last decade or so (along with dre and rza), but this album just wasn't that innovative. They seemed to pick up the annoying habit of all the rappers chanting the chorus. ""Red, meth & b"" and ""lowrider"", though, are really tight. Being a cypress hill fan, I would still pick it up, but the album is not as good as a whole as many of their other ones."
3,Not as good as previous efforts,"A rather uninspired effort, with Muggs thoroughly ripping off Dre's style on Lowrider, and the intro to Trouble sounds suspiciously similar to that of MatronsApron's Neutral Soldier. An acceptable addition to the Cypress discography nonetheless."
2,Disappointing....,"Ive been a fan of Cypress Hill since 1998. Ive got all the other albums, but somehing went wrong when Skull & Bones dropped in late 1999.After loving the raw sound and funky spooky horns and loops from earlier cypress albums, Dj Muggs style changed to more of a pop sound! only a few raw tracks were on that album, now when i picked a copy of this i was disappointed.The beats are very weak, to simple, to plain. There trying to change the style but it isnt working. I rekon this is the true fall of the group. Even the rock tracks are in short supply, any new fan of cypress hill would be mistakened for thinking they made the classic BLACK SUNDAY & TEMPLES OF BOOM."
3,Not bad to my surprise!,"I thought this album wasn't going to be nearly as good as previous efforts. To be honest, I was trying really hard not to like this album after I heard the ""Trouble"" single and the Skull & Bones album. I'm not much of a metal/rap hybrid style, but Cypress manages to pull it off. I actually think that ""Amplified"" would have been a better choise for the rock/rap single. While this is not Cypress' best album, it is definitely better than some of the other stuff they put out. The best song on the album has got to be ""Red, Meth, and B"" with Redman and Method Man. Other gems are ""Lowrider"", ""Here is Something You Can't Understand"" with Kurupt, and ""Amplified"". Overall, this album does not disappoint the hardcore rap fans, the loyal Cypress Hill fans, or the ""crossover"" fans."
5,Cypress Rules,"I gotta tell ya, I've recently bought the new Kid Rock and the new Creed, but they ain't nothin' like this! This is their best since Cypress Hill III! Every song on here is awesome! Buy It!"
1,dumb raiders,"listen up, i had this album for about a month (it's been highly available for download ) so i should know what i'm talking about.i have all their cd's but this one i ain't gonna buy.it's the most pathetical attempt in the last years ( it's worse than d12 even hard to imagine).the rock songs are so cheap and devoid of content you think a member of monkees wrote them.the rap songs are worsened by the guest vocals (kokane or whatever ).they should be ashamed with the result and now seeing they turned 30 maybe stick to producing instead of releasing dumb stuff over their true soldiers.my advice is DON'T BUY THE CD instead download 1-2 songs and you'll see what i'm talking about(audiogalaxy is fine).and if you feel like replying check out the cypress hill message board there and leave a message for me.so long cypress hill !!!"
3,I brought the Wu home.,"I enjoy the Wu's stuff as well as Cypress' stuff. But this time I went to the music store and gave them both a listen. I brought Iron Flag home. I even brought RZA's Digital Bullet home later. Cypress is disappointing. They could have been better, as in Temples of Boom, or B-Real's side project Psycho Realm."
5,LEFT 2 SOON.,IT ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE THE GREAT ONE'S START THIER JOURNEY INTO PARADISE WAY 2 SOON. REST IN PARADISE PLAYA. YOUR MEMORY STILL LIVES ON EVERY TIME SOMEONE POPS THAT C.D. IN ...... OH YEAH I'M DEFFINETLY GONNA SPARK A SWISHA FO' YA .. STR8 REPRESENT SOUTH SIDE FOREVER AND A DAY !
5,"TRUNKS KEEP POPPIN, TOPS KEEP DROPPIN DOWN IN HOUSTON","Body Roc, Body Roc bounce, bounce to dis. FATPAT is the lick, and ya'll can't resist. This album is a 12 on the Top 10. Boys steady down but he put it in they face. If you don't have it, get it. Wreckshop baby! R.I.P."
5,r.i.p. to fatpat,may one the most aspiring young and talented rappers rest in peace and i'll blaze one for ya!! this album is sure nuff dope enough to flop some heads up and down.go out and get this one!! order it now from amazon!!! you'll enjoy it no doubt!!!!!
5,A beautiful read,This is a book one would want to keep with them forever. The sign of a well written book of meditations/reflections is if the words send us on a journey with our spiritual centers. Streams of Mercy does indeed provide the vehicle for just such a ride.
1,Picture quality (VHS box set),"You really get what you pay for in this tape set as far as video quality is concerned. Let's forget about fight quality/content and focus on footage/picture quality. ALL 5 of the tapes are recorded in EP! HORRIBLE EP I might add! Although the fine print on the box and on the tape labels suggest ""highest quality EP"", that's really so far from the truth. Don't get the VHS edition if you're looking for a good quality picture. I only tolerate EP from tapes I record myself off of TV, not when I pay money expecting professional quality footage. Remember, this rating is only for video quality on the VHS edition and not for quality of the fights. There are plenty of other reviews here that judge the fight quality."
4,So So Production but as raw as it gets!!,"The fights on here were raw and rugged, kinda like the early days of UFC. If you are into wild fighting and lots of tapouts to strikes, this is for you. The production was so so, but the sport is very new and you are bound to see this at this stage. Nice to see some early fights on John Lober, Paul Varelens, and BEST OF ALL #1 heavy weight in the world Igor Vovchanchin. Igors fight are worth the price of this tape alone!"
5,Not Pride but still OK,"You'll see some fighters before they went to Pride FC. You'll see a young and thinner Vovchanchin in Kiev, Anthony Macias, Vernon White, Jeremy Horn, etc... In addition, theres girl MMA contest and though technically very bad, Its fun to watch.The set contains:Baton Rouge,LouisianaKiev,UkraineAkwesasne,New YorkBiloxi,MississippiMontreal,CanadaNote, This set and the other 3 Disc set together contains all of the IFC fights on DVD."
5,caged combat,"the best hand to hand fighting box set i own , 88 fights on this one a fighting marathon on this one this one is a must for all ufc style fighting fans"
3,ignite your curiosity,"If you are interested in how fires begin & what fighting fires is like, then you are going to like Barry Wilson's debut effort, & he knows a thing or two about fires & fighting them.Written as fiction, FIRES OF TIME is an interesting, if un-edited, ride into conflagrations present & past."
4,Interesting!,"Kind of strange reading about a firefighter going back in time to experince the big fires that have happened. But it kept me turning the pages to see what was going to happen next. It has a few sad moments, and a few happy ones, and a couple of great friendships that spanned 90 years. Barry Wilson did a great job of melding past and present."
3,"Mediocre information, but great photographs","There are many ballpark books which provide more and better information about ballparks. If you are going to buy this book, it should be for the stunning photographs of modern ballparks, the best I have ever seen published."
5,great book,great pictures and good stories...i really hope that i get to see all these places in person eventually...two thumbs up for the author....
4,The most beautiful pictures of any baseball park book!,"A really beautiful coffee table book with pictures I've never seen before of just about all of the parks. Like the other recent ballpark books though, there are some factual errors (i.e. the renovation of the Oakland Coliseum happened in 1996, not 1998).It's the huge color pictures that really capture the unique look of each park that makes this book special. A color picture of the Polo Grounds taken from the third base side during a game is most unique of the bunch.I'm a little puzzled as to why the author included 1991 dimensions on all the parks that were in use during that season - has this been a ten year project to put together?"
3,Stadiums left out,"I am disappointed that Braves Field, Griffith Stadium, and RFK Stadium were left. I could care less about Jarry Park, Colt Stadium, LA Coliseum, and Seals Stadium."
3,A fun family night game,"I got this system for Christmas and my family and I have pulled it out a few times and had a pretty good time. There aren't many games available (aboutr 10 or less) and I don't think you are really getting your money's worth for it. Its crazy that people are selling them on here for [...] dollars a piece, though. Walk into any Toys R US (one of the only stores you can get it) and there will be rows of them and they are always 50% off, $[...]. I can't imagine ANYONE would buy it from amazon. Go to [...] and get it cheaper. It is a good time a couple of times,"
5,Great system!,"This is an under-advertised system that provides hours of fun whether you're playing with children, among adults, or a mix of both. The various games provide play for crowd participation and individual me-time (Lock 5, Zap it, Gems & Sudoku are my favorites). With each player having their own individual remote and controlling their participation, it truly provides an evening of fun, challenging entertainment; alone, you have an evening of quiet relaxation. This system originally sold for much more - and even at the original price, it was a bargain. This is Fantastic game to have on hand when friends or family gather, regardless of their ages (in our home, the ages span from 82 to 14 and an evening of Game Wave competition fills the house with laughter)! The system comes with 4 remotes, and you can purchase additional. Some games allow for up to 6 individual players, but even without the extra remotes you can simply play as teams and accommodate any crowd size."
3,"It's ok, but not great.","This gaming system is inexpensive but you get what you pay for.Pros: Low Price, Famliy friendly, everyone can play at the same time, it plays DVDs well, 6 people can play together.Cons: Poorly made, most games are very boring for teenagers, remotes are not that responsive.My husband and I got this as a gift and were hoping to have fun with the trivia games, that's our thing. We used to enjoy those trivia games at TGIFriday's you play at the bar. This is no where near as much fun as that game. The trivia pursuit game on my cell phone is more fun, we play it when we are stuck waiting somewhere. The kids next door, 11y/o and 14y/o, were locked out after school so we brought them in and let them play it. I was going to give it to them if they liked it, but they weren't really into it. I will probably donate to charity now."
4,Fun for all,"I purchased the Game Wave system directly after seeing it in a Christian book store displayed with Arc Trivia game (BIBLE VERSION). We also play ""click"" and a Veggie Tales game. It is more fun than other games because it allows up to six people to play at a time with some games. More than just entertaining, it is educational also. Great fun.."
3,Game Wave,"The idea of the game wave is fantastic, the function of it leaves a little to be desired. Perhaps had I owned this before the wii then it would have had more appeal to me. The games are slow loading, and take a long time from one phase to the next. The fact that several people can play is a definite bonus though. The games themselves are fun and enjoyable for all. I have a 4 year old that enjoys it as well as the adults. The wii is my game of choice though.Also, its overpriced on Amazon!"
5,Great Series! Great Service. I love it!,"I have searched high and low for this series, and particularly ""Mommy's Rules"". I love the convenience of downloading an episode with one click and being able to watch my favorite episodes anytime I want. Had no problems downloading or viewing episodes. The only negative aspect I've found is that alot of the episodes are almost 1gb or more which eats up your hard drive space and makes it hard to buy the entire series without purchasing a larger hard drive."
1,Plastic Chocolate Molds,"Received my ""plastic"" chocolate molds last week and was more than disappointed. Though ""cheap"" they were beyond cheap as I have seen free plastic stuffing more sturdy. In a time when we are trying to keep things out of the landfill and be able to ""reuse"" things why would you market something that is such a piece of ""crap"". I will be lucky if it does not break the first time I use it. Needless to say I will not be purchasing any more in the future.Signed,Linda"
3,Is this at the wrong speed?,I have the LP release of this recording which is listed as 33 1/3 and I have to wonder if the CD is recorded at the wrong speed which sounds more like a 45? Anyone else able to make this comparison?
1,Haven't received the magazine,Haven't received the magazine so I can't really rate it...but getting the rating request makes me wonder why it isn't in my mailbox.
5,short review,"This magazine is, in my opinion, well thought out. The articles are interesting, relevant and well-written. Good photography. Quality paper. I enjoy reading it and look forward to reading it. Of all the magazines in our waiting room, more patients have had positive remarks on this magazine than any other. I just re-subscribed for my second year and quite pleased. Highly recommend."
2,very disappointed,"I found this magazine to be an odd mixture of science and spirituality, and almost all disappointingly shallow. I tried to cancel my subscription, but was unsuccessful as their customer service (contacted through the S&H website) was completely unresponsive."
5,LOVE LOVE this magazine,"I ordered the e-publication of this magazine as I feel guilty receiving paper ones due to the environmental impact they have. I have to say, I LOVE this magazine! It offers so many thought-provoking articles that encourage kindness, openness, tolerance, body, mind & spiritual health. I feel inspired & educated every time I read it!"
3,Okay,It's a cool idea but you can't see the baseball pattern on the bottom bead when in because it is angled down.
3,A comment on the illustrations,It has been pointed out that one of the illustrations shows a vessel with a ring above the pilot house that looks for all the world like an old fashioned radio direction finding aerial - in a world where radio was still 3 decades in the future. An actual photo of the vessel has been found and it was discovered that the actual item in that location was a pair of decorative antlers....Caveat emptor!
5,Great Buy,"Got these so my son could practice, and to fill Operation Christmas Child shoe boxes. These are solid quality base balls."
3,Coop Cups,"I foster for a cat rescue and I use these in playpens. I was a little disappointed that they don't sit level in the holders, so I can fill them only half full. Otehrwise they were fine."
3,This was better at first,I liked these at first but my dog figured out quickly that they make fun noises when you knock them off. So I'm cleaning water and food out of his crate every day.
4,quick delivery of a good product,"I was glad to find this cup for order as it is hard to find them anymore in local pet stores. I use two per dog for food and water in their crates they use during the night. I prefer this style with the hanging hook rather than the style that requires a wing nut and a screw as they are often either easily tipped or become rusted too fast. Unlike the fabrication of this cup style which has the same material for the cup and the hanger, that of the screw type uses a different fabrication with paint that holds the cup which I do not like at all. Happy to find this style as it is far superior for cleaning and moving."
3,Cute Movie,"I was actually fortunate to get some feedback from Adam Pascal and while this is no ""Rent"" it cute in its own way. It did have moments that were amusing and to be honest I only purchased it because I wanted to hear Adam sing and was somewhat disappointed, I think he only sang one song, twice I think. But I did enjoy seeing him perform. Seems like he was doing someone a favor by being in this movie because it looks like someone just starting out in the business. The continuity of the plot and characters were off, seems like either the cutting was off or the storyline. I Will probably watch it again and if my views change, I will update this review. Although the end of the movie was a total surprise."
2,Brings back memories,This movie is a great memory for those of us that visited or worked in the catskills. For me it really touched home as I worked there a few years ago.
1,Doesn't Fit!,I should have looked at the last guys review had the same proplem they are nice looking strong as hell but only works with monster distrubution blocks the end is to big to be called 4awg!
5,Excellent!,"I love John Gottman's work and I assign him regularily to my students. His work on partnership processes has always been first-rate and this book is no exception. Don't let the math scare you--it is an interesting read, indeed!"
4,Good for parents,"The video is good for parents to learn different techniques on teaching your child to go potty. I was disappointed because I was looking for a video for my son to watch, not me. He still likes to watch the children in the video go to the potty, but the narrative is for the adults. I do like that it's not in cartoon format, which is why I purchased it in the first place. I find the kids seem more interested in it when it's real children rather than animated. Good information. . . . Mom from New Hampshire"
4,prepubescent punk pranksters,"Those with no sense of humor need not apply. Throw out the PCisms and party with the irreverent imps of punkdom. Hard driving melodies mix with George Carlinesque lyrics to product a disgustingly delicious ""pie in the face"" to all that is holy."
5,This album was and still is awesome.,"If you're in your mid to late twenties, then you're down with how great this album was when it came out. I haven't heard it in years, ever since I lost the tape. Just got it again on CD and I must say it's still in my top ten of all time. Right ON!"
5,The best Meatmen album. Hardcore punk for the brave.,"This is THE best Meatmen album. ""Turbo Rock"" and ""Centurians of Rome"" are worth the album by themselves. True punk fans will want this."
2,You can do better,"I'm a reasonably fit Jillian Michaels and Jackie Warner devotee, thought to try this based on reviews for a little variation. Kinda disappointed. I felt that the choreography and changed were not explained well and that,for beginners in particular, safety measures around some of the moves are not explained well and risky for folks with knee issues. I don't want to deal with returning it, might use it for desperate variation, but between there being better products out there and the recent price hike ( from$70 to over $100), not sure it's worth it."
1,Cheaply made,"Althought I did not buy this item from Amazon, I wanted to warn others how cheaply made this item is. I was so glad I did not pay for shipping and was able to return the item. It was dented when I received it. The opening mechanism was not smooth and the decorative rubber gasket tore after several attempts to open and shut the bread box....buyer beware!"
4,Promise: Fulfilled.,"""Free,"" the debut single lifted from Ultra Nate's third CD, is an energetic thrust of pure disco bliss: positive lyrics, strong hooks, and a chorus to die for. It was surely one of the best and most soulful club anthems in years, and it richly deserved its Top Ten status in the UK. While the rest of ""Situation: Critical"" doesn't match the brilliance of ""Free,"" there's enough to make the trip worth your while. An arsenal of aggressive guitars are set to a thumping disco beat and a powerful choir in the catchy ""Found a Cure,"" while ""Release the Pressure"" stands out as well. ""Love You Can't Deny"" succeeds as an above-average house number, and the title track, which opens the CD, adds some variety to the mix as a laid-back, mid-tempo number. There was speculation as to whether Ultra Nate would have a future since amicably breaking ties with her mentors, the Basement Boys. But this fine album shows that she has enough identity and personality to stand tall on her own."
3,Great Party Background Music ; But Not the Best Ultra!,"After listening, it's hard for me to remember any of the songs except for Free and Found A Cure. The other songs sound like filler, enjoyable filler at that, but I've heard better dance music and much better Ultra; her Blue Notes album is superior."
3,Hard read,"This book is poorly written; it is very hard to read. It has taken me three years to read it. Extensive background preparation is required to understand this work; the bible of course, biblical history, and an understanding of the Documentary Hypothesis.The author proceeds to take apart the legal sections of the first five books of the bible. He combines these elements with the historical sections of the bible. He cites all other scholars that have ever written on this subject, some thousands of citations (that is just one of the reasons this work is hard to read). He develops several themes with this work; one, that the old testament is relevant for today's issues; two, no Christian can proclaim the mind of God without a grounding in the old testament legal system.Prior to reading this work, I had denied the validity of the Documentary Hypothesis. After reading this work, there is no doubt in my mind that Wellhausen and his followers are on the right track."
3,More than adequate.,"Like sleeping on and under a soft T-shirt... nice!Not plush, not luxurious, not elegant,but at this price... nice."
5,Comfy Sheets,"These are the most comfortable sheets I've ever owned. They're soft and strechy, like you favorite t-shirt. They also wash really well."
1,These sheets are Not soft .,My husband is complaining that they are scratchy and he's right. They are not comfortable even after 2 washings.
5,Very pleased!,Lovely color and excellent quality. They arrived very soon after I ordered them and no s/ h costs. A great bargain. Also ordered and recieved the light blue ones. Very pleased.
1,I WILL RATE IT -1 IF POSSIBLE,"The worst product I ever bought I Amazon. It looks like a ""T-shirt"" or rag or whatever you can call it. Very cheap material and very cheap design."
1,Disappointed with pilling sheets.,"I was first a little irked to find the sheets glued to a piece of cardboard that left residue when pulled away, but I figured that would wash away with time.What really has me disappointed with these sheets is the fact that they pilled after the *second* washing. I've always been under the impression that all-cotton sheets were less likely to pill. Does this not apply to jersey sheets, or are these just bad sheets? I have to wonder now that I'm starting to see them at discount outlet stores for even less than what I paid during Amazon's Friday Sale."
3,One big drawback to this sheet set .....,"Most disappointing to me is that the sheet set comes with 2 cardboard informational labels GLUED to the top sheet. I had expected them to easily peel off, but instead the stretchy jersey sheet was stretched and pulled out of shape.Amazon replaced the set with another, and I found the exact same problem. This time I had to go thru a 15 minute process of using adhesive remover to carefully remove the cardboard display label from the sheet.Other than that, the sheets are comfortable, soft, and launder well. But I would certainly like to see Wamsutta improve their packaging set up."
2,IT'S NOT THAT SOFT,"This sheet set is described as like a ""t-shirt and slightly stretchy."" It's true, but I don't know if that's a good thing. The sheet was a bit scratchy. I thought a couple of washings would soften them up, but it helped only marginally. I've also noticed a problem with piliation."
2,Way different from picture,The color of these sheets is much dull and non-rich looking than shown in the picture. The sheet size is right and the jersey fabric is stretchable but the sheets look cheap and nowhere close to looking luxurious. I believe that's what you'd expect for this price.
2,Sheets Irregular to the Extreme,The sheets arrived soft and after washing stayed colorfast but shrunk. They were difficult to get on the mattress.
4,Nice cotton feel,"These sheets shouldn't disappoint. They are thin, but comfortable. I have had positive comments from guests who use them. Great sheets especially for the price. I will definitely buy more."
3,Sheets were not the greatest!,"I have been using ONLY jersey sheets for the last 8 years. Although these were not the worst, for a extra 25.oo I would've bought the higher end quality in the dept. stores. These are not the sofest sheets and don't have the usual jersey feel. Maybe after a few months of washing they will!"
2,pills like crazy,"Looks good, feels soft, but ends there. After 3 total days on the bed, the surface is filled with scratchy 'pills'. I understand they can happen over time, but I have never seen anything like this. Soon to be buffing the car."
5,Excellent pictures and descriptions,A good reference for the enthusiastic hobbyist. Many items I wanted to identify in Georgia ecology are present and clearly described.
2,needs photos,"I've been very happy with other Peterson field guides, but this book doesn't have any photographs. I wanted a book that would help me decide what to plant and to identify trees in our area, but sketches don't work for me, and there are no photos other than on the cover. Didn't fit the bill for me."
4,Useful Guide to Trees,Ever look at a tree and wonder what you're looking at? This book will step you through the process of naming that tree. Very helpful.
3,Not for inexperienced botanists.,Very informative for people that already have some plant knowledge and can use a plant dichotomous key. Not good for those that are not plant savvy.
2,Tree book,"I like Peterson's wildflowers' guide. I find this guide difficult to use, but I have to admit I am a novice at identifying trees and shrubs."
3,Takes some getting used to,"Granted, I'm not a botany person, more of a bird person, so I'm not used to using keys. This guide takes some getting used to, since the trees and shrubs are split up into multiple sections. You need to find the right one before you start to use the key. Then the key points you to a plate where hopefully you find you've correctly identified what you were interested in. There are also appendices in the back for winter keys and others. There are some tree silhouettes at the beginning of the guide but otherwise the plates only show leaves, twigs and fruit or flowers if present. I have succeeded in using it on a couple of hikes but it definitely takes some patience if you're plant challenged like I am."
2,book review,"This book was extremely difficult to finish. I was surprised because it had gotten some great reviews and I was really excited to sit down with it. I also ordered Dear Prince Charming and have only gotten a quarter of the way into it, it has been sitting unread for ten days; which is totally unlike me since I love to read. I would recommend borrowing this book from a friend if instead of purchasing it. Save yourself a few hard earned dollars."
2,Painful prose,"I had thought this would be a nice light summer read, but I could barely get through it, and ended up wishing I hadn't wasted my time. As other reviewers have mentioned, the story was totally implausible (the mystery aspect in particular), which I could have overlooked if the writing weren't so cringe-inducingly awful. This could have been a fun read if it had some good editing. If you don't mind repeatedly being hit over the head with the story points, repetitive language (lots of ""fierce"" looks), and trite one-liners (at least two characters were suffering from ""MSS: Martha Stewart Syndrome""), this might be the book for you."
1,Terrible ending,"The main character was cool, the romance was ok, but the suspense plot climax where the identity of the stalker is revealed was predictable, pathetic and small minded. Even a bit bigoted. I can't believe Janet Evanovich blurbed this book."
1,I'm in 75 pages and already can't stand the guy,"I came downstairs to my computer in the wee hours to see if any Amazon reviewers say this book is going to get better. The Riley guy seems boring as s**t, and I'm already thinking he's a dweeb. Now that I've read the other reviews, I think I'll skip ahead and see where the heck this thing is going. If anywhere.Glad I flushed almost seven bucks down the toidee."
2,Ugh. Easy to put down,"I am not one to leave books unfinished, so I plowed ahead with this one, but it would have been easy to walk away from this ""Sex in the City"" meets ""Nancy Drew"" groaner at any point in this thin plot. It very much reminded me of the dinky paperbacks I loved as a preteen, where the heroine always had an adventure of some sort and then reluctantly fell for the last guy she would have expected. The book borrows heavily from the character set-up of Sex in the City (although projecting the supporting characters down the altar) without the finesse -- I lost track of how many times the phrase ""multiple orgasm"" is used (the pursuit of which might be considered the theme of the book). If you want fluff, you'd be better off in front of the tube. If you want a thoughful, sexy, well-paced novel: you'll have to keep looking. How I wish I had!"
1,NOT the film that you've seen advertised,"Buyer beware: this is NOT the film that you've seen advertised on television (synopsis: ""An author travels to Barcelona to see his estranged brother and dying father, where he learns that his life is plagued by events that occur at 11:11"", taken from IMDB).This is a low-budget, direct-to-video, ripoff hoping to trick people by using an almost identical film title and releasing it very shortly before the other film. notice this film uses slashes ""/"" between the numbers: 11/11/11. The other film (the cinema release) uses dashes ""-"" between the numbers: 11-11-11.This sort of dishonesty is appalling, and Amazon should at least be upfront about the fact that this is a direct-to-video release."
1,An Exercise in Absurdity,"As noted by other reviewers, this is not the 11-11-11 film heavily advertised on television. This is a low-budget knock-off that my husband rented from Redbox because he thought it was something else. Trickster moviemakers.Letting go of the fact that this movie is basically hoodwinking the public into renting or buying something that they're not... This movie is a stinker. Judging completely on its own merits, it's fair to say that this movie HAS NO MERITS.It does feature the 11:11 phenomenon as well as some 9/11 conspiracy theories, but mostly it's a no-budget movie that isn't worth watching or reviewing. The acting is completely pathetic. Directing and writing aren't any better. The premise is ridiculous and whatever potential may have existed in the script has been choked to death.It's not scary, it's not clever, it's not even cool in the way that overly cheesy horror movies can be. This movie has no redeeming qualities."
1,The title looks as if someone were to rate any 6 Asylum films in a row,"Jack and Mellisa Vales soon suspect that the 'spooky' coincidences that occur at their new house could have to do with their son, who also might happen to be Satan. Or the person that founded the Asylum movie company, they're pretty indistinguishable from each other.It's an Asylum film, so telling you that it's cheap, badly acted, or obscenely tedious would be an exercise in redundancy. To be perfectly blunt, I no longer really blame them for releasing an unending putrid stream of cinematic atrocities. They must make money from some gullible sap out there. Having instant Netflix,however, I don't waste my money, just my time (which is also a travesty in its own way)"
2,Good for a laugh,"This isn't quite ""so bad it's good,"" but it is good for quite a few laughs. I wanted to give it more stars as a comedy but then everyone would yell at me for raising the overall rating for the wrong reasons. Almost reaches ""Troll 2"" level of bad but not quite. It might have been better if they had shot for that goal, then they could at least attain cult status. I don't resent watching it since it was on Netflix Watch Instantly, so essentially no money wasted, only time. I think someone should nominate this for Rifftrax to cover."
1,Horrible,Bad acting and even worse story. I know this is a low budget film but I've seen other low budget films that are more creative and with a better cast of actors.
3,A twist on Rosemary's Baby,"This one posits a situation where Satan returns to Earth in human form as an 11-year-old boy just as he turns eleven. What his parents do not know is that many people in the neighborhood are in on the plan and plotting against them even as they prepare for the return of the one they worship. Only the wacky lady who lives next door knows that they are up to no good. Some okay performances here and a twist at the end, too."
1,This is NOT 11-11-11,"This is another movie completely, they used slashes instead of hyphens. I have read some real horribe reviews of this movie. The movie 11-11-11 does not show up here."
4,This is an alright book,I think this book is an alright book.I liked it when Erin and Marty got trapped by the praying mantis'. I also liked it when they got chased by the werewolves. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes horror books.
3,Ride of your life,"This book is written by R.L. Stine. This is a horror book. People who read this book may like it. I know I did.This book is about two boys. They both like to see the movies shocker on Shock Street. One boy's dad work at shocker studio. They both were invited to go there and be the first kids to ride a new ride at the studio. The end was......well, go and read it to find out the ending."
2,What Rubbish!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"What utter Rott!Erin and Marty love horror films their favourites being the Shock Street films In the end Erin and Marty are being chased and they go out of control the reason is they were flippin' robots. How could R.L. Stine write so badly,his other Goosebumps are at least 100 times better than this one {I should know as i have read virtually all of them!} Do not read!"
3,A movie that in some parts is very good and others are very boring...very OK. I liked it though. I say B,"""I got to go tomorrow, or today, but I just keep thinking what if this is all we got, what if this is it?"" Casper (Rosen) is a soldier home for a few days when he meets high school classmate Becky (Jones) at a bar. After getting in a fight Casper and Becky begin talking and wind up walking and talking for the rest of the night, revealing deep secrets to each other throughout the night. This review may sound confusing. I was trying very hard to like this movie for some reason. To me this movie alternated from really good to really boring over and over. The movie is pretty much just the two walking and talking for an hour and a half but it is still a decent movie that if you are in the mood for is worth a watch. The ending is very good and is worth making it all the way through for that. Overall, a movie with real high and lows that is worth watching. When you are in the mood for it. I give it a B."
1,Ehh...,"I read this book and communicated with the author as well. I also used to be an engineer with the company where he cut his teeth (Crane Co owns Dynalco).Jean is a bit of a self absorbed individual and there is no holding it back in his book(s). His coding standard that he touts is ridiculous, the examples are lack luster, and his writing style is that of a salesman selling his own product. (I also went thru his OS III book and code as well, no difference, and a couple of bugs, namely he sets the timer tick task to the lowest priority, big no-no).I think some of the 5 star reviews here on Amazon were more likely to be from his employees.There are plenty of other options out there. If you get the books, read thru them, do the examples, and then tell me I'm wrong I'll accept it, but in my personal opnion, I am stcking with my other tools (EMBOS, RTX_Kernel, VXWorks).Good Luck"
5,"Easy to use, even for beginners.",This is the first real-time kernel I use and with the help of the explanations and examples in the book it's very easy to use. I recommend UCOS-II to anyone who wants to enjoy working with a real-time operating system!
4,"shaken, not stirred","I only have a minor nit about this product. That is, why clutter up a nice piece of equipment like this with selected drink recipes? It would have looked nicer if it only included measurements. Though, the measurements are marginally useful.Here is why you might want to buy this shaker over the shakers with integral tops that you are looking at:- You can mix drinks with a hearty shake due to the increased capacity that the tumbler portion gives you. This chills a drink faster. Depending on the ingredients, it can make them frothier.- The rubber seal fits well. It does not leak. It is much easier to separate than a metal shaker with a metal top.- You can strain the ice without the need of a strainer. (Hold the shaker horizontally and slightly separate the two halves.)- The tumbler fits inside the metal bottom for convenient storage.- It came in a nice case. Thus, it is a good choice for a gift."
1,Markings disappear in short order,"I'll be brief: I like this shaker because of the quality heavy-duty glass and nice stainless steel; I HATE it because the markings are rapidly fading away. I bought this specifically because it was graduated in ounces (hard to find for some reason), but as another reviewer mentioned, it will be clear glass soon enough."
3,Wonderful for making iced coffee drinks too,"I'm a nondrinker and I use mine for making iced coffee drinks rather then coctails, It works wonderfully for that, as in it fucntions perfectly well and as a boston shaker should.On the other hand, I find the cocktail recipies on the side to be an excessive ammount of printing for such little use. It doesn't effect functionality, but its just not pretty. I would assume that most people who go to the bother of making cockatils at home have their own recipies and don't need the ones cluttering up the sides of this thing."
1,Cruzan,"The shaker works great, tight seal but after several cleanings the printed design on the outside of the glass came off."
5,everyday pan,"This is the only place that I could find this pan, I looked everyplace locally that I could think of. I couldn't find it anywhere else on the internet except Amazon. I have one like this, and I absolutely love it...use it all of the time. I wanted another for a gift. Fantastic price, great quality. Shipping was very fast.12/4/07 I'm back for my 3rd pan. Everyone who sees it loves it. Once again, I'm giving it as a gift. Very heavy duty, and multipurpose. Great for large capacity cooking needs. And once again, a very good price."
5,Planets in the Signs and Houses: Vedic Astrologer's Handbook Volume II,"Easily a must-have for any serious astrologer. He's like the Simon Cowell of astrology, and I really value his words."
5,Stands alone,"On the basis of this book Carlo Levi became one of my favorite authors, along with John Berger (most of whose books I've read and reread), Haldor Laxness and Carlo Ginzburg. Levi describes the kind of people that my wife and I are continually searching for in our wanderings on foot, 'originals'. Maybe D. H. Lawrence should have gone to Gaglianao instead of looking around in Tuscan graves."
2,Unappreciative of This Work,"Being a college student who has read already read a diverse amount of literature, I would have to say that Christ Stopped at Eboli was one of the worst novels I have read. I will say that Levi has mastered the use of descriptive language to very accurately portray the plight of the peasants; however he offers little compassion for the peasants and at times writes of them in a condescending manner. Perhaps his condescension is a true portrayal of class differences back then, however I could not identify in the least bit with Levi. Nor could I identify with the peasants, because there was absolutely no character development in this book. Levi wrote a descriptive novel -- he told things like he saw them, but without passion and intrigue. I found this novel to be very dry and mostly uninteresting. A college professor or older person may disagree, but from my standpoint this book had little to offer except that it was a good look at a different part of the world."
5,Favourite,"I think this is my favourite book. It is certainly one I wouldpack amongst my Top Ten for life on a desert island. It is about theindomitability of human spirit. It is about attempted repression and inhumanity of fascism, yet it is about the small wonders and joys that are human life. Eboli, the nearest major town is the 'last outpost' of civilization - beyond which are 'heathens', untouched by Christ, or salvation. Of course that is a metaphor, not reality, for our little village has the same corrupt and stifling religiosity as elsewhere.This is one of those personal accounts that makes it possible to begin to understand the enormity of the outrage of political repression, and ultimately war."
3,Book purchase,"The book was shipped and arrived in a timely manner in very good shape for a used book. So far when ordering books through Amazon.com, I have been very satisfied with them and pleased with the responsiveness of the sellers in fulfilling my order. The book itself has been interesting and most descriptive about the area in which it takes place. It is not, however, one of my favorite reads."
3,Cover is ugly,"The book that I got looked absolutely different from what was displayed, the cover was of that ugly bright green color. That was not what I ordered."
5,Year in exile,"This is a memoir of a year spent in exile in 1930s facist Italy. Carlo Levi ,anti-facist, is exiled to a small poor village in southern Italy. When the villagers say Christ stopped at Eboli, a village located northeast of theirs, they mean that civilization never made it this far. Levi's prose descriptions are smooth and mostly free of authorial intrusion. He turns what could be a grim situation, after all he is a prisoner in the village, into a cherished part of his life."
4,life in basilicata,To read the history of this area which has only come into its own since this book was written was very interesting and prepared us for a visit to Basilicata.
2,Unconvincing,"Acrosleuth clearly draws inspiration from the more musically complex contemporary electronica outfits (especially the likes of Plaid and Download). However, ""Acrosluke Firewalker"" has nowhere near the impact of these more successful acts, largely due to the fact that the various instrumental parts fail to gel together and provide a cohesive whole. Even though the liner notes suggest a healthy dose of ""real"" organic instrumentation, the majority of the album is remniscent of the rather plastic sounding MIDI-generated music from the '80s. This is particularly disappointing in the light of more recent developments on the electronica scene, where ProTools sonic manipulation and more flexible generative software are becoming the norm, opening up musical vistas well beyond conventional twelve-tone sensibilities."
1,Deceptive advertising on the book description - this is just a REPEAT!,"The book jacket says ""continue their story"" but this book is just the second part of the original ""Little Women"" book excerpted out. It adds nothing new. It ends at exactly the same place in the story. The chapters titles are the same as ""Little Women."" I bought it because I thought it was a sequel. I feel completely ripped off. I don't understand how the previous reviewers missed this essential point!!!!"
2,for my grandaughter,I did not comploetely see all of this because it was so poorly acted and so much rediculous sterotyped footage that I stopped and gave it to my grandaughter who loved it. Go figure.
1,not for my child,"While I appreciated the whimsical drawings in this book, the message contained within I found shallow, bordering on offensive, and inappropriate for my daughter. And I'm a liberal! Something about the story just rubbed me the wrong way, and I ended up giving it to the Goodwill as a gift. Clearly others have loved it- my advice, read it first before you buy it, and think about the myriad of messages it may be sending an impressionable child."
5,Darling Book!,This is the most beautiful book! My kids love it more than any other book. They never get tired of reading it. The pictures are amazing and the story is so fun!
3,beauty junkies,"it is an overall goodbook,but one thing attracts the attention is that the author is very self centered.one cannot deny the good sides of plastic surgery or its substitutes,like botox or others in the same field.being born not a long time ago,the author does not know how lucky all women are today to have handy so many ways to stay beautiful and young.eversince humankind exists,human beings have been looking for the magical recipes for staying young.the author was born when all these fights were elements of the past.exagerating?maybe but why be so intolerant if people feel like doing it???? intolerance is what drives to such extremes in working on yourself but it is fashionable now to be''natural''........let us wait until she really NEEDS it badly.would she prefer then to be a junky or an old rejected hag?????"
2,NOT AT ALL WHAT I EXPECTED...,"TOO BORING TO GO ANY FURTHER THAN THE FIRST SEVERAL CHAPTERS. I THUMBED THROUGH THE REST AND SAW IT WAS ALL THE SAME. NOT REALLY A PERSONAL CONFESSIONAL-SHE MENTIONS HER PROCEDURES VERY BRIEFLY. IT INSTEAD READS LIKE TEXTBOOK MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE ORIGINS OF PLASTIC SURGERY. IF YOUR ANYONE WHO HAS HAD, OR IS PLANNING TO HAVE ANY SURGERY OR INJECTIONS, SKIP THIS BOOK-UNLESS YOU WANT TO READ ABOUT SOLDIERS WHO WERE DISFIGURED AND MAMED DURING WAR SO PLASTIC SURGERY WAS BORN. ALONG THOSE SAME LINES, I DID NOT WANT TO READ IN EXCRUTIATING DETAIL ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF THE ""POISON"" BOTOX AND HOW IT WAS ORIGINALLY FOUND AND DEVELOPED FROM ROTTEN SAUSAGES. THE STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE SHE ACTUALLY KNEW ARE SHORT AND SO COMPLETELY OFF THE WALL FROM WHAT ANY NORMAL WOMAN WOULD EVER WANT TO DO ARE USELESS TO READ ABOUT AS WELL. UNLESS YOU ARE RESEARCHING FOR REFRENCE THE STATISTICS AND ORIGIN OF PLASTIC SURGERY-SKIP THIS BOOK!"
5,Tells it like it is and names names,"This book names names: from revealing the names of celebrities who've had work done, to revealing the names of doctors (and one particularly horrible New York cosmetic dentist) who rip off their patients and leave their patients scarred or worse while flouting the law, the truth, and their patients' safety.In other words, it has all of the pleasure of celebrity gossip, with none of the guilt. That's because this book is, at its core, a well-written, serious work of journalism that publicly shames some very bad doctors and a very bad dentist. It shows how the system is failing patients, and why it needs to be reformed.I LOVED this fun book. It is a true page-turner that left me laughing whenever it didn't make me gasp in disbelief. I highly recommend this book!"
5,5 star Beauty Junkies Review,"EXCELLENT, ENGROSING, ENGAGING, ENLIGHTENED, EXPERIENCED,EXTRAORDINARY !!!! WISE _ WELL WRITTEN _ WONDERFULThe book is a great service to understanding the full scope of what is actually involved in plastic surgery & of what goes on in general: inside the industry and inside the individual minds of people electing to undergo CS. It is fascinating! Our culture is obsessed with youth beauty and self re-invention. Kuczynski provides a witty, thoughtful and smart evaluation. Her willingness to share her own personal experience is brave and insightful."
5,Beauty Junkies IS addictive!!,"The perfect combination of Alex Kuczynski's astute, probing reportage and her personal, riveting journey as ""just your typical Manhattanite."" In trademark Alex Kuczynski fashion, Beauty Junkies is witty, clever and profoundly poignant all at the same time. If you live in New York, LA or Greenwhich, you'll be nodding along knowingly. If you live anywhere else, your mouth will be hanging wide open until the last page."
1,ACT! LINK 2.0 for Use with QuickBooks,"It's a good thing there are none available. I brought it used and am unable to install it on my computer. I get an error message that doesn't make sense, since I have already installed the ACT software required to support ACT! LINK. I have e-mailed SAGE and got no response. Use caution when purchasing this version, as I believe the problem might be that ACT! Link 2.0 for Use with QuickBooks is not compatable with QuickBooks Pro 2008.I must add, my business partners have had no complaints. In fact they love it. Maybe I will too, if I ever get to use it."

2,"Great beginning,...but quickly went downhill","I was hooked from the start, but quickly became disappointed when Cormac crumbled and became a real [...] because of a vow he made to cold hearted Isabel. I am so glad that I read a few other Hannah Howell highland books before this one, or I would have given up on this author. It was a painful read while trying to digest the core of this book, which revealed layer after layer of Cormac's weak persona. I wanted to beat Cormac over the head because he was such a fool, and wished Elspeth would have found another man worthy of her undying love. Elspeth was spectacular...Cormac was too weak. Highland Knight...Highland Warrior and Higland Bride were all captivating. This one Highland Vow....was a big let down."
1,I dinnae think this a verra good book!!!,"The opening page was great.That's what drew me in. Ms. Howell's story is lacking in description. Everything is conversation and the character's thoughts. Once in awhile there's a table,horse or a bed(and no description of the afore mentioned). And while were on the subject of horses, I'd love to see Ms. Howell get on a horse while holding a baby and a cat. I'd also like to see her pack a baby cradle on a horse. The main female character,Elspeth supposedly has a gift of knowing when someone is being truthful or not. It was briefly mentioned twice or thrice. why bother mentioning it at all? I'll have to be dropped on my head a few times before I ever read another book by this author."
3,highland vow,"Although i have to agree about the cat & baby on the horse i dont agree with the overall review about Hannah Howells books I have most of them and enjoy reading them over and again. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that they aren't so easy to get in Australia, I especialy like the family saga's that continue each sibling/family members story it lets you no who has children whos had more. I especialy like the fact that with highland vow it has started with the next geneartion of the family."
2,What a WUSS!!!!,"It got 2 stars because the beginning wasn't so bad but come on...he is still panting after a woman who passed him up not once but 4 times over...and she is betrothed again!!! Vow or not what a loser! I was willing to go along with the story line until he gave up Elspeth and then I say ""forget it...he is a wuss not worth her or anyones time."" And when he learns the cold truth about the other woman (looking like a complete ninnyhead when he hears it) he still doesn't flee to Elpeth's side... Even Elpeth character voices her anger over this.And lastly what was the purpose of getting all these extra characters involved anyways. Who cares about adding the baby, the cat, or the extra kid. They have no point in the story."
5,lively tale with the inside dirt on horse trading,"Jonah Dereham is an honest horse broker dealing with an increasingly complicated world. Hired to buy a bargain horse, he gets attacked. Then one of the horses in his stable is let loose, and further attacks occur. As the violence escalates, Jonah wonders who is really behind the whole thing, and why. It appears that an anonymous mafia like character wants Jonah to play by organized crime rules. Along the way, Jonah finds a strong willed girlfriend with grit, and has to deal with his alcoholic brother. This book is first class - a diamond in the rough. I am surprised it hasn't reached more readers."
4,Knockdown Is a Knockout,Mr. Francis shows us another part of the British horse racing scene. We are shown it from the Bloodstock agent's view. Very well done as usual.
3,Sale Ring,"Kentucky horse country, Keenland Sales where million dollar bids are common pulled this reader into the so-so Dick Francis' thriller, KNOCKDOWN. The behind-the-scenes glimpse of the British sales ring is good as we enjoyed a well paced mystery.Jonah Dereham purchases horses for wealthy buyers, but all goes wrong in a gentleman's agreement world when greed for commissions enters to picture to destroy lives. Jonah finds himself under attack from sources unknown and close to home, but he fights back.Dick Francis is a good read, but this one ends the race as an also ran.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
2,My last Francis,"Knockdown I found to inspire me to no longer read Dick Francis. He writes thrillers, not mysteries--lots of action with a predictable and hackneyed plot but no interesting sleuthing to at least spice it up as in an Agatha Christie. This book has some interesting sections on the ""behind-the-scenes"" world of purchasing horses and kickbacks. However, these bits of interest are outweighed by the silliness of the ""tragic hero"" with regards to both the love affair and Crispin.If you like thrillers I guess it'll do but if you're looking for a mystery it's a poor choice."
5,Classic Dick Francis,If you've read the more current books you must go back to his early books and read them all. They are alla terrific read and something you can reread constantly. Arrived in great shape
4,"Perhaps a TKO but not a knockout, 4+ stars","This is a solid Dick Francis novel with interesting characters (esp. the supporting cast), a bigger than life hero, a mystery, and lots of IMHO fascinating information on a lesser-known aspect of the racing sport--the bloodstock agent (perhaps called horse trader or agent outside of the British Commonwealth). It also has a modicum of love interest, the long-suffering of the hero, his triumph at the end, but with some pathos too. The ending was a bit too pat for me--not readily believable IMHO--regarding Crispin--though I suppose stranger things have happened. There is a fair amount of description of Crispin's alcoholism, but today (the book is over 30 years old) the hero would probably be considered co-dependent. This work may not be Francis' best, but it's quite enjoyable--certainly not his worst book. My favorite quote in it is: ""when success could breed envy even in friends, in enemies it could raise spite of Himalayan proportions."" Enjoy!"
2,not worth the grade,I sent my coin in to ANACS and it came back that the coin had been cleaned and worth half as much as I paid...
3,Nice case but watch out for the belt clip attachment,"I tested the ruggedness of this case when my PDA went flying to the sidewalk because of the poor design of the belt clip attachment. A small metal stud screws into the case, but no matter how tight you screw it in it always loosens. It unscrewed its way all the way out and the PDA fell to the sidewalk. The bottom of the Rhinoskin was dented, and the SD card popped out, but the PDA was undamaged.If you use the belt clip, put a drop of Loctite or Cyanocryolate (super glue) onto the threads of the metal stud before screwing it into the case.The case is very sleek, but also very slippery, so keep a good grip on it and be careful when letting others use it as they may not realize how slippery it is."
4,"good, but...",The case itself is great! The problem is the belt clip. It breaks too easily...which is why I know that the case is so good.
3,"Yes, the belt clip can be fatal, but...","It's a well-built case (aside from the belt clip), that opens like a book, so lets you access the screen easily. There's enough space in the upper left side to loop a sturdy string, or some other material, to make a neckstrap of sorts."
4,The Tale of the Firebird,"The Tale of the FirebirdBeautifully illustrated, lovely text, paper and presentation of an old Russian tale.which I heard during my childhood with less wonderful illustrations."
3,too intense for my aged child,my child loves mythology and serious stories but this one just switched around a little too much for her to keep track of the storyline - maybe just over her level.. we'll keep it and try again in a year or two. LOVELY illustrations though
5,"""As Bread That Is Broken""","I find ""As Bread That Is Broken: to be an exceptionally spiritual book. I read it many years ago during a noctural adoration session at our Church. I must have purchased a copy at that time. I recently began rereading the book at my present church during First Friday Adoration time in our chapel. I bought a second copy and gave it to my daughter to read. No report back yet. After purchasing the book recently, I found my old copy."
4,A classic of its time.....,A funk pop offering from a splinter of 3 off of the Human League with some great tunes and great lyrics. Remember the '80's? Remember Thatcher? Remember the Yuppies? All these things come back to the minds eye when hearing these tracks again.The album may sound a little dated but its that very quality that makes it so memorable!
3,Not bad.,"The Luxury Gap is not bad. There's some good stuff throughout. Heaven 17 plays listenable synth pop. The musicianship, songwriting, and production are solid. Some of the material is quite catchy. Glenn Gregory does well with the vocals, and the album also features some nice keyboard work. The songs on The Luxury Gap tend to be busier musically than the ones on Penthouse and Pavement. These songs have a little more meat to them. My favorite song is ""Let Me Go."" I believe that's the first song I ever heard from this group. It's really a cool tune. I also like the lyrics to ""Key to the World."" The Luxury Gap is worth a listen."
1,Does not work with Vista,"I bought this a couple of weeks ago. It is no longer available, but more importantly it does not work with Vista. Customer Support replied to my query simply by acknowledging that it doesn't work with Vista and offering a 20% discount on Spyder3. At the very least, they should have suggested that I return the product for a refund."
2,Spyder TV by Colorvision,"The product has high potential. Unfortunately, tha same cannot be said for the company, Colorvision. The hardware would appear to work fine. The software is problematic:(1)it does NOT work with Vista(2)it does not load completely with XP Professional(3)the web site patches do NOT work(4)the web site is difficult to navigate to(5)Customer Service is TERRIBLE! unresponsive, indifferent, and if and when you do get a response it may have no relevance to your problemI returned the product out of frustration"
5,Everest Season 2,"Everest lovers, this is the penultimate adventure video ever produced!Outstanding footage. Great drama and interesting characters. This is better than Everest Beyond the Limit 1. I'd tell you why but that might give away ending! The best 2 videos on the subject, ever. If you get Season 1 you absolutely MUST get Season 2!! Watch them both and you won't be sorry! Since seeing these programs I won't have to climb Mt. Everest!?!"
5,My Kids Love This,"I'm confused over the review stating your kids will not laugh...My 10 and 11 year-olds howl whenever they hear this recording. The Death of Mary, Queen of Scots is their favorite. But they play this cd over and over and laugh uncontrollably every time.There are classic Python routines on this cd, just like all of their recordings. Plus, they round them out nicely with material unique to the recordings, so it is not just rehashing TV material.This cd was funny 30 years ago when it was an LP, and it's still funny today."
5,Doug and Dinsdale rule! The funniest CD I've heard.,"There are few albums -- music or humour -- which have given me as much sheer enjoyment as this one. This was their second LP, and arguably the Python team's writing was at its height. (Yes, yes all right, the Parrot Sketch is on the first album, but that is simply a transfer by the BBC of the TV sketches to audio.)Besides the constantly interfering Spanish Inquisition, this album also features the Piranha Brothers spoof documentary, which was very tightly based on the Kray case of the time. Episodes 1 and 2 of the Death of Mary, Queen of Scots, are also here in their magnificent entirety.Buy it before it gets deleted."
3,"Great cocoa, but not real hot chocolate","Great cocoa, but not real hot chocolate. If you crave real spanish hot chocolate, you need to buy something else. This is sweet hot cocoa."
1,"Simon Coll ""spanish"" hot chocolate","I bought this product, since I just came from my vacation in Spain and had there my churros with the hot chocalate ""a la taza"" style, which is a very thick dark chocolate taste. But this product does NOT come nearly close to the real taste. It is super light flavored, kind of sour and once is done it starts to ""desintigrate"" or crumble, like when milk becomes sour with its lumps and sour taste. Didn't like it at all. Wouldn't recomend to anyone!"
4,REPresent!,I am a label manager and producer based out of Phoenix Arizona. The Rep possesses enough talent to expand to a nationwide market. I was hoping to hear him produced by The Professionals; as I believe was originally planned but Mustafa and the various other producers hooked this album up. The Rep is much more than a christian rapper- his positive message is universal- he is a true emcee. I will be looking forward to hearing more of his material in the future.-Creepz of ArizonaHipHop.com (Lost Soul Ent. & Promotions)
4,"Thanks, I really like this item","Thanks, I really love the sound of Karelia, I searched this item long time ago, but unfortunatly this CD there wasn't on eBay at the time... Thanks Again"
1,Wrong product,"I searched for an hour and paid extra for this product because the description said ""Tie Down has coated S-Hooks to prevent marring and scratching"". What I received was straps that had uncoated ""J"" hooks, that are not useable for my intended project."
1,Terribly overpriced and badly designed,"After spending almost 5K on a gorgeous Sony laptop, this port replicator is a sad, badly-designed mate for the laptop.Nobody at Sony even thought before they decided to sell this ridiculously designed docking station. When you sell something that is a ""port replicator"" it really should replicate all the ports, including something as BASIC as audio!Also, the connector is cheap, cheap, cheap-- plastic and flimsy. Don't buy this if you plan to travel a lot with your laptop, because the connector won't survive much movement if you plan to reconnect your laptop on a regular basis."
2,Simple port replicator,The port replicator makes hooking the laptop to a monitor and keyboard easy. Its not a great product because it doesn't have positive connection control and doesn't add any port types that are not already on the laptop. I would like to see a DVI connector for external LCD monitors. A solid connection that is easy to determine if you are correctly connected would also be a good addition.
1,Pure junk,"I can't people can get away with publishing this garbage. This guy doesn't know a thing about the hi-tech/dotcom scene. If he had a brain in his head, he would have been in the middle of it, making some money of his own instead of sitting on the sidelines writing about it.A previous reviewer mentioned the review at salon. com - read that review - it is right on the money, as well as being a pretty funny attack on Aspatore's stupidity."
1,YOU CAN BE RICH TOO....not...,"This book reads like an infomercial. YOU CAN BE A SUCCESS! GET RICH TODAY!! EASY STREET HERE YOU COME! Does it talk about the serious problems many start up's face? No. Does it talk about the large number of sites that have gone bankrupt? No. Does it talk about PROFITABLE businesses? Just Barely. This book is easy to read...and exciting to read...no doubt about that. But...it's not a good book. I suggest that you do some serious soul searching before you start a small business, and make sure NOT to read this book."
3,Chiasms in the new testament,"This book mainly centres on chiasms in the new testament. While it does not take the thorough approach of Dorsey's excellent book on chiasms in the old testamentLiterary Structure of the Old Testament, The: A Commentary on Genesis-Malachi, it is full of examples from the new testament and elsewhere and supplements them with useful and interesting analysis. The author shows how there can be an increase in meaning as the chiasm develops the matter in hand.For those who do not know what a chiasm is, a simplified explanation. Let's say a passage has five points. They form a chiasm if the first and last points have some correspondence (either because they are similar or because they are contrasting), and if the second and the second last correspond, and the middle point is either the key point or a kind of turning point. You can have a chiasm in one verse, and even a whole book can form a chiasm."
3,Good boook.,"Lots of fun. Good sci-fi. The obvious ""pro-life"" sentiment of the author gets a little in your face, but does not take away from what proves to be a fun adventure."
3,Good not Great,Not Boring. Enjoyed this book for a change of pace but didn't leave me with anything to take away/
3,"Nothing spectacular, but good.","I compare this book and old Bujold books to a Clancy novel. Nothing inspiring or spectacular, just a fine read.Bujold spends a lot of time before and after the action takes place, and it works quite well."
3,"1st half boring, 2nd half full of action","Not sure what the big deal is about this book. There's nothing new here other than making space opera realistic by using realistic (if somewhat stereotypical) characters. I did enjoy _Shards of Honor_ and I like the characters but there are really no ideas, nothing new. It's almost as if Bujold started writing background notes for her next story then just added some action scenes and called it a book.I didn't hate it, it just makes me feel like I just got done watching a soap opera. I guess I'll give a couple of the Miles books a try and see if I like them any better."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Countering coup.Aral and Cordelia are married, and when the current bloke in charge carks it, he gets left in charge. All is not well however, as political opposition stages a coup, with leads to their damaged in the womb by poison attack son's environment being taken away, and the pair forced to go on the run and see what they can work out to set things write.As the regent's wife, the more liberal Cordelia will have a changing effect on the Prince's upbringing compared to the status quo."
2,The high rating of this book is difficult to fathom.,"The Hugo Award has long been a guarantee of excellence in science fiction. Classics like ""Dune"" created viable alternate worlds, and characters that were true to human experience and to themselves. Their observations on the human spirit, psyche and experience were profound.Anyone approaching ""Barrayar"" hoping that the reading experience will approach profundity is totally out of luck. If this turkey became a movie, Susan Lucci would be the ideal star. A group of one-dimensional characters goes through a series of cardboard evolutions to promote a plot so ludicrous it would make Flash Gordon cringe.I don't mind a disappointing novel, but I hate seeing a prestigious award like the Hugo wasted on basting a pathetic turkey like this one."
3,Good adventure,"The story in this book is dominated by the great characters. The author really gets into the characterizations. The characters feelings and motivations are described, but for all the touchy feeliness, there is still more than enough action sequences to keep you entertained. As far as SF goes, there is very little 'S' and much more 'F'. Take out the nerve disruptors, hovercraft, and plasma guns the story could be set in 18th Century Europe. It fact the society the story takes place in has lords, peasants and a stratified class system. There are no strange cultural elements in the story although alternative cultures are hinted at. This is pretty much a straight forward adventure novel that reminded me a lot of reading the 'Three Musketeers.' Overall average for what it delivers."
5,Chilling!,"If you can, without being chilled, watch Jacqueline Bisset's face, when she sees the Devil whom she has conjured up, well, you've got ice water in your veins.Excellent performances by Kurt Jurgens and Barbara Parkins"
3,Skull House NO/Mephisto Waltz YES,"Buy this movie exclusively for the Mephisto Waltz, the Skull House is the worst directed, acted and predictable movie ever made. The Mephisto Waltz is a great psych thirller, even thought I can only see Alan Alda as Hawkeye for MASH. Pay close attention because the plot can be complicated and the switching of time frames makes it difficult to follow, but still worth it. Good acting and directing!!"
3,A Classic Horror Movie,The Mephisto Waltz is a classic horror story. The cast is a very good. I especially like the ending which has a nice twist to it.
4,An Obscure Fright!,"4 Stars = ClassicHere is a very good post ""Rosemary's Baby,"" satanic cult film. With Alan Alda & Jaqueline Bisset, who I've always thought as one of the hottest women of her day! Great acting abounds, with good direction, story, & execution!Great creep factor here, a superior film for it's sub-genre!"
3,Do That Voodoo That You Do So Well,"This is an unusual double feature offering as the two films seemingly have little to do with one another. House on Skull Mountain almost feels like a Blaxploitation film as 99% of the cast is African American and the formal theme is about lineage and heritage. There's an interesting inversion here that we in the postmodern age would find interesting. The storyline of four heirs are summoned to a Caribbean island for the reading of a will, and find themselves at the will of a Voodoo practitioner (I don't want to give anything away). Its a serviceable film, and frankly, had the cast been all Euro/white/caucasian, wouldn't not have been as interesting. Now, this contrasts with Mephisto Waltz as European high society is depicted as without morals and succumbing to their own desire and deepest intstictual drives. I will say no more about this, except that its a pity no one reads Freud anymore. It's a plain mystery why Alan Alda got to be a household word."
5,FOR HORROR COLLECTORS,"WOW 2 Movies for the price of one, the best of them MEPHISTO WALTZ, with the beautiful Jacqueline Bisset, and a chilling music score of Jerry Goldsmith"
2,Nowhere near as good as the reviews say,"I love old classic horror with lots of atmosphere, especially with a satanic aspect to it, so after reading the reviews of the Mephisto Waltz, I couldn't wait to watch it.What a disappointment. It wasn't terrible, but it's not something I'd watch again. The 'suprise' ending was hardly a suprise.I give it 2 stars.Kenny"
3,It works...,"Well when I bought it, it was 7.99. I don't think it should be priced at 14.99.It works, however, I have had some issues with it. Sometimes when I restart the cpu, I have to remove the device otherwise my cpu won't go past the bios screen.But I have seen in some cheaper models, a common windows xp error message about the power levels etc. on the usb device. So I haven't gotten that message yet. All and all, I would recommend for under 10 dollars, over 10 dollars get a pci 4 usb card."
1,not satisfied,"shaver had broken trimmer on receipt returned to discount jungle on may 3,2010 still no credit received unit returned vis ups tracking # 1zf485700342778433 very poor supplierPaul T Cheponis"
2,"Great shave, but...........","I've had Remington shavers for many years. This was a replacement for one that lasted 10 years, before it became difficult to find replacement foil/cutter. This new shaver gives a great shave, as good as my last shaver, but the battery will not hold a charge for more than one shave, which means that I must plug it in every night in order to shave the next day. If I forget - no shave that day. I didn't think this would be that bad, so I didn't return the shaver (which is a pain), but this defect has proven to be a major annoyance. I am very disappointed in this product, not what I have come to expect from Remington. Buyer beware."
1,Battery lasts 20 seconds...worthless!,"I purchased this product because I have had Remington's in the past, inexpensive and reliable. However, from the first time I used this razor, the charge only lasts about 20-30 seconds. In that amount of time, I can't really accomplish much. This purchase was a complete waste of money and now I am stuck using the old razor I was attempting to replace. Now I am faced with starting from scratch. BUYERS REMORSE!"
3,Disappointment,Good shaver but let down by poor battery life. Lucky to get 3 or 4 shaves from one charge. Surely the battery should last longer than this. I previously had a similar model but the battery life was much better than this one. Maybe with Remington newer doesn't necessarily mean better.
2,Disappointed With Battery Life,My Braun recently died on me after serving me well for a number of years. My wife went out and bought the Remington and while I have no qualms about the shave itself (it does a decent job) the battery life is downright horrible. Does not hold a charge for very long and the most disappointing thing is that there is no visual indicator that it is low on charge nor can you shave while it is plugged in! Going back to Braun. You pay more but I find you get what you pay for.
4,Great shave,"This razor gives a very smooth shave. But after using it for about 8 months I decided to replace the heads and screen. Not easy. Getting the microscreen out of the holder is next to impossible. And when I finally did replace the microscreen and the heads, the shave is not as good."
5,Great razor. Would recommend.,I've used this electric razor for the past 2 years and it has done a great job. It leaves a smooth shave with no uncomfortable nicks or cuts. The battery life allows for 1-3 shaves on each charge.
3,Not for the layman,"[...]Shalit's work is written specifically for psychology and military professionals. His detailed categorization and impulse to construct word formulas can be tough to wade through. It is also quite old, published in 1988.From the title, I was hoping for a more comprehensive look at psychological issues within and surrounding conflict and combat. Instead, it was focused heavily on detailing and categorizing the types of aggression, while analyzing their value in producing effective soldiers and units.Shalit does take an interesting look at the process of coping and provides some interesting statistics on Israeli soldiers' differing attitudes towards Syria/Egypt/Jordan - including former POWs' attitudes of each army. But in the end, none of this is really enough to make the book worthwhile.[...]"
4,Great book,"The techniques in this book are very powerful. It may take some time to find the points initially but once you know where they are, its a great tool to have to relieve tension. It could use some re-editing, but is quite good as it is."
1,Painful. Is this supposed to be a comedy?,"No laughs here. Just the cringe-worthy sight of 50-something Alec Baldwin trying to romance a 21-year-old character. It's not that it's creepy. It's just that there is no chemistry whatsoever. Neither lead is likeable in any way. If this is a date movie, it's enough to encourage singlehood. If it's a comedy, someone forgot the laughs. So what is it? A bomb."
4,"Charming, a little like an Eric Rohmer film--only in English","Suburban Girl reminds me a bit of Eric Rohmer films of the 70s and 80s and other French films that takes time exploring a relationship. The characters are so well played by Sarah Michelle Gellar and Alec Baldwin that you can well imagine their lives will go on after the story ends; the young woman and the older man warmly recalling their love and of lessons learned.Suburban Girl is so much better than the huge amount of drek in the cinema right now! If this is the fate of small, charming movies than I would highly recommend staying at home and buying/renting old Erich Rohmer, Claude LaLouche movies or if you don't care for subtitles than Howard Hawkes, Preston Sturges and the like."
1,BAD. NOT romantic. zero chemistry and depressing!,"From the beginning i just kept thinking ew... this is creepy and sick and he just looks WAY too old her for (and not in a hot wow, hes george clooney, old but good looking kind of way... in a EW, he could be her father [esp since there is SO little chemistry between them]). Not funny. slightly depressing and VERY VERY slow. ** i fell asleep during it** LOVE SMG, but not this movie! stay away!!"
4,Surburban Girl is Adorable,Sarah Michelle Gellar's and Alec Baldwin's banter and chemistry are believable and very entertaining. The dialogue is witty and sexy. You cheer for both of these characters to find themselves and benefit from being involved. The casting is perfect. The soundtrack is a blast. I highly recommend it!
2,Hope Melissa Bank got paid well for this!,"I loved the book and the screenplay did not disappoint, but was deeply disappointed by the casting of Ms. Gellar, who did her best but just could not pull off this character, who is more Carrie Bradshaw than Buffy. To begin with, they dressed her in clothes a la Nancy Botwin in Weeds which are worn by women who look sensual in them (as does Mary Louise Parker), while SMG just looks like a 30 year-old dressing like a 50 year-old (who claims to be only 22 years old!) Then, she is just not convincing as someone who reads all day and fights for authors. The overall effect of the sets, costumes and locations paired to this script and Buffy WAS creepy, as so many other reviewers said. I just hope Melissa Banks made some money off of it, it certainly wasn't her fault."
2,Bad Ending,"Suburban Girl overall was ok. It is not a movie that I would personally watch again. Part of it could have been my timing. In the movie Sarah Michelle Gellar's Character's father passes away. I watched it the day before Father's Day and my father passed a few years ago. When I first rented this movie I was under the impression that it was a romantic comedy as well. There was kind of a melancholy feel throughout the whole movie. Another thing that displeased me was the way that a relationship between an older man and younger woman was betrayed. In this movie it made it seem as though that type of relationship was pretty much doomed from the beginning and that is not always the case, granted this is a movie and not real life as well.It is an ok movie to watch but don't do it on a rainy day."
4,"A few awkward moments, but worth watching","After reading the description and a few reviews, this movie appeared to be shallow and uninteresting. However, after watching it, it became one of the few romantic comedies that leaves me thinking. Many reviewers have commented on the lack of chemistry between Alec Baldwin and Sarah Michelle Gellar, but I believe this casting was intentional. Brett and Archie do not have a normal romantic relationship, but why would they? They are not a traditional couple. She is looking for a father-figure who will guide her through life and he is looking for a way to become the father that he never was to his own daughter.There were a few awkward scenes that made parts of the movie disjointed, but, altogether, the film was complex enough to stick in my mind and inspire me to write a review. This movie is worth watching."
5,Music Score for the movie ...,I love this movie. I had searched for the music (score)for quite sometime and just so happen to find it today and I know there has been at least one other person ask about the music being played when Brett is reading Archie's book. The composers name is Heitor Pereira and he has a website which lists ALL of his music and can be played right from his site as long as you have Quicktime. There are six of them for Surburban Girl.Brett and Archie Break UpBrett Reads Archie's BookLatin HildaBrett Wants To CelebrateI Miss YouLeave an ArchieShould the link not work just search is name and on his site click on his Films tab.[...]
4,A Veiled Gem,"It's nothing profound, or is it? It's surprisingly not that cheesy, perhaps a little cliche, but in the end it actually had me questioning her decision. While frustrating to not know if I agreed with the ending, it's better than the alternative--knowing exactly how it was going to end."
3,Witty romantic comedies are hard to come by,"This is actually a really cute film with witty one liners, and a decent script. I think 2 things worked against it - a truly stupid title and Alec Baldwin. The idea of a younger woman being interested in a much older man actually worked, and I would not be easily sold on it most of the time, but Alec Baldwin is kind of creepy. I wish someone else was cast in the role, even someone like Willem Defoe. And while totally irrelevant, Sarah has some really great clothes in this movie - I actually got some ideas."
5,Very Pleased,I was very satisfied with the book I ordered the shape it was in and the fast delivery.
1,Waste of my time,This is the worst book I have ever read. If you insist on reading this book I suggest checking your local library or the used book section on amazon (buy new/used from $0.13).
1,ordinary writings by an ordinary writer,"Bill Simmons is like the annoying sports fan at your local bar and the overreacting fans on your favorite team's message forum. Outside of Boston sports teams, he knows very little about the topics he discusses but tries to pretend that he's a sports know-it-all. Instead of providing a true fan's perspective, his site and writings are more of a personal forum for him to bash the sports individuals or teams that he doesn't like. Every now and then, he cracks a great analogy. But as everyone knows, sifting through a lot of waste to find a nugget of gold just isn't worth it. If you really want to hear annoying rantings of an uneducated sports fan, why would you waste your time reading this book when you can at least pretend to be social and talk to the fans at your local bar (or message forum)?"
2,"If you read his online column, you can skip this book!","I'm not a fan of the Red Sox, rather, I'm a fan of the Sports Guy & baseball in general. I read Simmons' online columns regularly, & therefore was looking forward to this book. I have to say I was disappointed -- I enjoy his writing style & sense of humor, but this book seemed all to familiar to regular readers of his columns. Therefore I'd say this book is worth a read for diehard Red Sox fans and/or those who don't regularly read Simmons online....otherwise, skip it!"
2,If you are a loyal reader do not buy this book,"I am a huge Simmons fan, but there is no point in buying this book if you have already read all these columns. The footnotes are just not worth it. Unless like me you felt like helping Bill out with some more money. If you have not read all of Simmons work go ahead and buy the book beacause Simmons is very enjoyable to read."
1,disappointing,"This book pales in comparison to other books on the sox championship. If you're already a sports guy fan, then chances are you've read most of this online on ESPN. So, why buy this writing when there are many other MUCH better books on the red sox 2004 title? I felt like I was reading a third grader's essays as I went through this piece of ""work"" (quotations because it couldnt have been too hard to transfer from online to print)."
2,clip show,"Like many of the other reviewers, I feel this is an opportunistic shot at making some dough. Not very Eccherstentialist of you Mr. Simmons. How very Kornheiser of you. I love the fascination with Gabe Kaplan in Simmons' columns and that will keep me reading, however, I hope the next book could be less ""How Ross and Rachel Made it This Far"" and more new material.Eccherstentialism is on the rise. Howard Dean got some work done. The Oil Can bio title is dreamy."
1,Bathroom reading,"Can someone please write a column about funny writers who become so self indulgent they lose all of their non-local fans within weeks by writing article after article about the same topics except instead of being critcal and edgy, replacing that with ""excuses for not being allowed to be edgy"". Also, Boston just lost and didnt make the ALCS...not a peep out of Simmons...instead he wrote a boring boring boring article about a new movie called ""Two for the Money""...you dont need to tell people not to see it....no one saw it except for you b/c it looked awful."
3,Decent Book for fans of Sports and Pop Culture,"Disclaimer: I am a religous reader of Simmons on ESPN page 2 and absolutely LOVE his work.However, I found this book only moderately entertaining as it is a collection of his old works leading up to 2004. The book I bought had added commentary, but I found some of the references to be dated (of course) and less entertaining than his current work.I recommend this book for anyone who is a Red Sox fan or a fan of Simmons writing from ESPN Page 2."
3,An OK read.,"This book is really good if you have yet to read any of Bill Simmons' articles. However, much of the book is just a compilation of his previous articles, so it really doesn't cover a lot of new stuff. He makes sly comments about his previous writings, but that is the best part of this book."
5,Simmons a true die hard fan,"As a Red Sox fan, I figured this would be a cool book to read. Surely it was. Simmons, besides being a die hard fan with an excellent ability to write, has a neat sense of humor.Even for those who have read his columns before, his various sidenotes to those columns should keep their interest going. However, Simmons should have had footnotes to the sidenotes for those who are not avid viewers of Beverly Hills 90210 and other pop culture items that he invokes."
4,"Classic and fun, 10 and ? are the stu","Classic and fun, 10 and ? are the stuff music is made of. check out the music samples and see what else they offer."
1,Not Good,"At the beginning I thougt it was good, but in time I found outthat the RF communications did not work well. Very often the mouse did not obey a click and other times two click open two folders or windows. Finally I got tired of the problems and I came back to the normal mouse with cord.It was not the problemof fixing the time of the click's mouse. It simple do not work well. My recomendation to the company is to improve the RF communications."
5,Reliable and Accurate,"Very easy to set up (about 5 minutes). Average size, and works great! Accurate and consistantly reliable. Great buy for the price."
4,"Good range, fair battery life.","I have owned this mouse for over 6 months and use it daily. The best qualities of this mouse are the range and feel. I have used this maouse over 20 feet away during a presentation. The mouse is solid and feels quite comfortable, great for hours of use. The only downfall I have found is a short battery life compared to other mice. Although, I have only used one other wireless mouse, a dell, so I don't have much to compare it to.Overall, this is a good mouse for a budget but I would suggest upgrading to a laser mouse if you have the cash."
4,Way better than a corded mouse,"I used to use a Targus notebook mouse and that thing was tiny! It was kinda neat for awhile but got annoying for extended use. I didn't want a full size mouse since I was going to be carrying and transporting it frequently. This Logitech mouse is just about the perfect size. The left click button is not quite perfect and takes a little time to get used to but that is the only flaw and does keep it from getting 5 stars. The receiver is about the size of a USB thumb drive and both the mouse abd receiver fit into the carrying case with the receiver fitting into its own divider. Nice touch! The mouse has a power switch which is great for saving battery life but the original battery is still going strong even after a few times when I have forgotten to turn off the mouse. Good enough wireless range even with my USB port in the back of my notebook.Overall, worth it for the price and would definitely recommend."
3,Heavy,"I liked almost everything about this mouse. It was a convenient size, worked very smoothly with no delay, had a handy on-off switch to save batteries, a travel pouch, and the USB transmitter was fairly small. So what's not to like? In my opinion this mouse felt like a lead weight. It's personal preference, as I've seen the heaviness referred to as ""a good weight,"" but if you like your mouses light this one's not for you."
2,Won't last long,I have had this Logitech mouse for 3 months now and it is almost entirely useless. The batteries become too weak after 3 days and the cursor is jumpy and won't move across the screen. I don't know if the laser has become weak or the transmitter has died. The mouse does not turn off after sitting idle. You have to remember to turn it off everytime you leave your computer. I would strongly recommend another brand if you're looking for a mouse that will last.
1,Loses Connection,"This Logitech mouse loses the connection every 5-10 minutes. This is my second wireless mouse. My first bluetooth mouse, a Radtech, was good but had very short battery life (2-3 days). My latest bluetooth wireless mouse, a Belkin, never loses the connection and has been using the same two AA batteries for weeks."
1,One dead mouse....,"Hmmmm...though the software loaded seamlessly, I can't get the mouse to work...! The instructions are simple enough--perhaps, too simple...there is no trouble-shooting info so I suppose I'll be sending the thing back--bummer...."
4,Must have for notebooks,"Highly recommended for laptops. Even though it has a ""connect"" button, never had to use it. Just plug and play installation. No need to download/install drivers. Used it with Win 2000 and Win XP.Pros ::* Solid responsive mouse* Just like any other mouse* Cordless so no tangled wires around you* Optical so can be used on ( just about ) any surface* Small USB receiver* Cute carrying case with separate pouch for receiver* Used it, without any issues, with my wireless internet connection* Easy to replace batteriesCons ::* Might be small for a person with large hands &/or long fingers* Just 2 button mouse* Not aware of any way to program the ""buttons"" ( for ""left handed"" persons )* Slightly heavier ( because of batteries ) compared to a general optical mouse."
4,A great mouse for the mobile trooper!,"Initially, I was using a standard Logitech wired optical USB mouse for my HP Compaq Notebook. It worked well enough, but lugging a corded mouse to all my classes, along with multiple textbooks, other computer accessories, and other sundry items was beyond maddening. Then I got the Logitech Cordless Optical Mouse for Notebooks. The shape, though not as good as Logitech's MX510 wired mouse, is excellent, as wireless notebook mice go. I'm not a big fan of those miniscule optical wireless mice not much larger than a real, squealing mouse. They give me hand cramps like you wouldn't believe. Anyway, this mouse is an excellent choice, and the only fault that I can find with it is remembering to switch off the mouse after I use it, but I'm beginning to get used to it, lest I give the battery industry that much more revenue."
3,Nice Mouse But A Power Hog,"I really like this mouse. Installation was no problem and it works great. Only thing is that the batteries only lasted 3 days. And I was carefull to turn it off when not using it, even for a trip to the kitchen for a cold beverage. This was a shock considering I have a Logitech wireless mouse and keyboard for my desktop and have to change the batteries only every 2 months or so.I did however take the advice of another review and purchased NiMH batteries and a charger. We'll see how long these expensive batteries will hold up what with being charged every 3 or 4 days.Why Logitech couldn't incorporate some power saving elements into this product is a mystery to me."
2,very uncomfortable,"the mouse looks very nice, and it is compact, at beginning you do not feel too much, but as time going on it feel heavier and heavier, and you have to try to use some strength to click the button.overall not recommond to buy it."
2,Heavy and Less Accurate Mouse with Bulky USB Receiver,"I have used Logitech mouse for a long time and I currently own several Logitech mice for three home computers including two laptops. I have to say that I am not a big fan of ""wireless"" mouse made by Logitech-not yet at least. This particular model is heavy with two AA batteries and considerably less accurate than wired mouse. Furthermore, the USB receiver of this mouse is a bit bulky and blocks the adjacent USB port of my Dell laptop. Instead of this model, I strongly recommend Logitech Notebook Optical Mouse Plus (931073-0403)--small wired mouse. I am happy with this light and accurate wired mouse with sleek USB connector that never blocks the other USB port. Also, portability is a lot better than the wireless mouse."
4,good mouse,"This is a mouse designed for laptop computers, but yet it's not too small to make you feel uncomfortable. The only problem I have is that the receiver is just a tad too thick. This is a problem for me as my computer only has two USB ports and they are ""stacked"" instead of being next to each other."
3,"Comfortable, but doesn't last that long","I liked the feel of this mouse, and the on-off button is great. It was a great mouse--while it lasted. It lasted only about a year and a half. And I didn't even use it all the time."
2,Missing pieces,"I chose the rating that I have because the mouse came, it was slightly used and worn down but I bought it knowing it was like-new.The order came at a generally regular shipping period but when I opened the package I noticed that there were papers for a wired optical mouse and a bunch of papers in with the mouse, that didn't seem right. It eventually turned out that there was a missing USB adapter for the wireless mouse to even run. I feel that this order was very futile for even being up on Amazon.com. However, the brand name and mouse itself are very quality and I know this as I had purchased one from Amazon in the past. I hope I can get my shipment corrected and I hope that this seller realizes the mouse is useless without the USB. Thank You"
4,"Not very portable, but pretty reliable...","They made this mouse a little bulky, presumably for ergonomic purposes. I've seen better designs. This was not my favorite laptop mouse. However, it was fairly reliable. I won't go into all the details, because other reviewers have done that pretty thoroughly. My only recommendation is to hold it in your hands and try it before you buy it, if at all possible."
3,Battery are expensive,Moouse worked fine till like 8th month when computer could not recognize this mouse..Then call Logitech and they sent me a brand new upgraded version of this mouse. I love that and their customer service. But this mouse eats up lot of AA batteries
5,Great Mouse,I got the mouse for my husband for Christmas. He has a notebook computer and was tired of the mouse cord and the power cord getting tangled when getting the computer out and putting it away. He is extremely happy to have only the power cord to deal with.
1,Rubbish,"It was rubbish, I bought it from somewhere else and it failed to work for me, I tryed cleaning it but it still didn't work.I sent it back to get a replacement AND I still coulden't get it to work, I might just have been my P.C but I don't think that, that was the case."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I haved tried two of these mouse(both of them from Amazon) and both of them died within two weeks, very unreliable. The mouse needs two AA batteries to operate and this makes the mouse twice heavier than normal mouses, Then what's the point of being a mouse for a notebook? Companies are now producing mouses that take only one AA or two AAAs, so serioulsy consider those, Do not waste your time and money trying these craps."
3,Relax!,"Well....this book was not what I thought it was going to be. Sometimes when you are searching for something you stumble over something else, which apparently I did. I found this book to be an open and honest adventure into the world of meditation and channeling. Just be sure when you hear that first ""hello"" you are ready for the journey. This book will help educate and guide to a higher spiritual path but it is recommended to do your own research and studies before taking the test."
3,"""When First You Sigh (?)""",This was a very interesting book. I did want to keep reading and not put it down. Just don't know what to think of it but it was very interesting and something to truly think about.
5,Surprised,"I really was surprised at how enjoyable this little book was. I thought it was well written and explained a lot of things that I have always thought of as kind of wooie, wooie! I applaud the author for her believes and her book."
3,scratches easily,"Watch face scratches easily. Within a week of normal wear surface was completely scratched up. Also didn't realize this was a leather band :( and I'm thinking the faux snakeskin or whatever it's supposed to be will be peeling off soon.Other than that, comfortable, easy to read and looks great! Lightweight and delicate."
1,this sucks,i never receved the item and there was not refond i lost my money thanks to amazon and patner
1,Order this book if you understand Spanish.,This is a beautiful book but unfortunately I can't read it because it is printed in Spanish. Amazon had informed me that the English version is not available so I am returning it.
3,Sonic Youth's Computer Age rules,"This is a fairly uneven collection of Neil Young covers. While some are good (like ""Barstool Blues""), others are (weak). The only one that makes the album is Sonic Youth's cover of ""Computer Age,"" originally on Neil's Trans album.This may be the only cover of a Neil Young song that I like better than the original. It's loud and obnoxious and experimental, but it rules!"
3,It is what it is.,"Obviously this is going to appeal mostly to fans of ""Neil Young"", but the bands on here are pretty great as well. First of all, any album with ""Sonic Youth"", ""The Pixies"", AND ""Dinosaur Jr."" must be good, and all their covers are good. I also like the covers from ""Soul Asylum"", ""Flaming Lips"", and ""Psychic TV"". The only thing about this disc though, like all tributes, is that it just makes you want to listen to the real thing, which of course ""Neil"" is. Also check out Willie Nelsons tribute album ""Twisted Willie"", which has the same caliber of bands."
3,"A few interesting moments, Neil might be amused","This is a spottily good recording. I like the Psychic tv song - ""only love can break your heart"", the Pixies song - ""winterlong"", and of course sonic youth's - ""computer age"", but the rest of the songs are only listenable. Not bad, but not worth selling your second born child for either (assuming your first is already spoken for by Rapunzel). On the whole, this is an interesting release, not essential, but worth purchasing for collectors of the various artists represented. Those who are looking for introductions to Neil Young should go directly to Decade, those who are curious about various artists represented on this album should also look elsewhere. Oh, and nick cave's ""helpless"" is also a pretty good cover."
2,not good,"I bought this because I like both the cover bands and Neil Young, but it isn't very good. I wouldn't pay more than $5 if you see it in a 'used' bin."
1,An Expensive Coaster,"Outside of a few decent contributions from Soul Asylum, Henry Kaiser and Victoria Williams, this recording is virtually worthless. Quite possibly the worst ""tribute"" CD ever to make it to mainstream distribution."
1,"Poorly done, ill-conceived waste of money!","Someday, someone will explain a better way than Microsoft's, but this is CERTAINLY not the one! The author cannot see beyond his anti-Microsoft bias well enough to see what he is proposing an anlternative to. He clearly has no viable understanding of what Microsoft has done and is doing. His recommendations are incomplete and loaded with half-truths. Save your money!"
3,Worth Watch Movie,"However no matter how much it reminded me of a few other films you'll not see a film quite like it, and personally it's usually well worth watching unique films from the Golden Age."
5,wow is what I say,"I've not used it yet for any projects, just opened the package yesterday containing same, good Lord this is a super duper heavy book and is so impressive just by its size and weight that I my expectations are extremely high.....I will come back later and write a rating on the ease of use on the content later....but if you buy this as a gift, the receiver will be blown away by the size and weight of this book alone!"
4,They you put this there,"While good, it often lacks information that I am specifically looking for, while telling me how to do more advanced projects that I am not interested in. Buy it for the illegal construction worker in your life."
2,RD New Fix-it-Yourself Manual,The information inside is helpful. Was totally disappointed about the books appearence. I bought this book for a Christmas present and the cover was bond upside down. I gave it to the person I bought it for as there wouldn't be enough time to get another. He said it wouldn't be worth the hassel to send it back. Very disappointed.
5,Helping Build a Handyman,I bought this self-help book for my young nephew (he is married and father of 2; his dad passed when he was 14...no one taught him the basic things to keep a household running). It is a Christmas present. Finally he will have a research book on hand for simple 'fix-it' jobs.From THE good aunt
3,"New Fix-It-Yourself Manual: How to Repair, Clean, and Maintain Anything and Everything in and Around Your Home",Good book
5,AMAZING Guide Book,I bought two .. actually .. one for my first-born .. and one for myself . . . VERY easy directions for any do-it-yourselfer !!
5,Bargain Hunter,"Received this book from Amazon in record time and in good condition, as promised. This is a gift for my son-in-law for Christmas. He always gets stuck with all the ""honey-do"" projects around their home, my home and his parent's home. He's a good sport about it, but thought he could use some reinforcements!"
3,"God book, but lacking in some areas","It's a good book, but lacks stuff like roofing repair, landscaping and other ""necessities"", while including stuff like fixing dolls which seemed unnecessary."
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this book as a Christmas gift for my son. I started to leaf through it prior to wraping it and I am glad I did. This book was published in 1977 and although there is a lot of information - much of it is outdated - how many people do you know who own electric typewriters or bonnet style dryers in 2007??? I would have been very embarassed to give this gift. It has been returned and we purchased another book from the local home improvement store which contains all of the newest technology with regards to home repairs, etc. Sorry I was not happy with my Amazon purchase!!"
3,Out of date,"The first half of the book focuses on traditional time tested items like door knobs and faucets. I didn't read the copywrite, had I found out how outdated it was I probably wouldn't have purchased it. Many of the ""electronics"" they teach you to fix are dinosaurs.The first half is invaluable, the second half is laughable."
3,Needs to be updated,"I bought a Readers Digest ""fix it"" book about 30 years ago and used it until it fell apart. The ""New..."" book has a copyright of 1996, 16 years ago. Had I known the info did not include anything made in this century, I would not have purchased it. Granted, it does have a lot of really good info, but is definitely outdated."
5,"""the next big"" bogus offer","Let's face it, you can't get something for nothing!The San Francisco Chronicle recently exposed the real story behind the so-called ""offers"" that are continually being posted here.Do a search on Google or on sfgate.com for ""iPod not really free David Lazarus"" and you will see what the con artists running these programs are really up to.In a nutshell, it's just another way for spammers and other sleazy people to steal your personal information."
1,very disappointed with this product and the company as well,I never receive the product that I order nor did the company fail to inform me that they were out of this item. I had to call the company because they charge my credit card and I had to track down the company by email which they never responded. When I got intouch with the company they shipped me out a different color and it was scratch up and the ear pluges was used and the ipod was loaded with music.
2,low battery life,"I have gotten this mini twice now. And both times, I had to return it because it only lasts for up to 2 hours. For an item that supposed to last to 18 hours, I feel I was cheated when it only lasted for 2. I returned this to Amazon and bought from Apple directly. I still have the same problem. Only 2 hours. If I didn't like the design of the mini so much, I would just get rid of it altogether."
4,"Great MP3 player, but . . .","The iPod Mini is a great little mp3 player with its small size, aluminum shell, and elegant interface. However, if you need a player for the gym, outdoor sports, etc. you may want to check out the iPod Nano which has less moving parts and is far more durable. No internal hard drive means it won't skip on you, and it will survive some pretty harsh drops without destroying the drive.The mini does give you color choices, and with the recent intro of the Nano, will be cheaper at some stores."
5,Ipod Rocks Rio Carbon Sucks,My Friend Has A Rio Carbon That Runs As Slow As A Turtle When You Try To Record Things He Tried to give me his Carbon and Fifty Bucks For My IPod
4,Great Product.,"Would have given 5 stars, but it broke as soon as I got it. Now it's fine. Had to purchase extended warranty.Otherwise love it!!!"
3,iPod Minni,"A really nice product, but extremely non-durable. Drop it once, buy a new one. May experience skipping, or songs that will randomly not play anymore, just by-pass. (To fix that, delete those songs and re-upgrade your iPod...aka hassle)"
1,Don't be brain washed.. bodyswerve this and do yourself a favour!,"Shame!!! I so wanted to join the pack!! I wanted to be seen with the white earphones and I wanted to join the conversations about playlists and Itunes.Had problems with software, changing volume while also changing tracks and my biggest problem was not being able to share my music.What happens if my computer's stolen? That's okay.. my hundreds of dollars worth of music is stored on my IPOD.Forget it.. and you can forget the music too.Sorry Apple.. I took it back to Goodguys and got an Sandisk instead."
3,Mini I-Pod,"The ipod was a gift to my daughter, she wanted the blue one and was so happy. she put on 100 + songs from my itunes library and used her itunes gift card, life was good. There was a glitch somewhere along the line and a couple day later all the songs she bought from the itunes store wouldn't play from her ipod. We are still working on it, but she is bummed. She says all the best songs are the ones she bought and they don't play from her ipod.I'll have to call tech support since removing and redownloading the songs didn't work either..... All in all I think I would like to get one someday for myself"
