4,AMATEUR GUIDE TO BUILDING ROCKETS,MY TEENAGE SON AND HIS FRIENDS WERE INTERESTED IN BUILDING ROCKETS AND NEEDED INFORMATION THAT WOULD HELP THEM AND GIVE ME SOME CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WOULD NOT HURT THEMSELVES. THIS BOOK GAVE THEM THE TECHNICAL INFORMATION THEY NEEDED AND HOW TO DO IT SAFELY. I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS THEY ACHEIVED FROM HAVING THE BOOK. I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT ANY PERSON WHO IS SERIOUSLY INTERESTED IN AMATUER ROCKETRY CONSIDER THIS GUIDE.
2,Patchy Presentation,Although the Authour displayed enthusiasm for the subject I can't escape the impression that this book was cut and pasted from other sources. Many of the topics where spread throughout the book and this lead to confusion about some aspects of the fuels which I don't feel is an acceptable situation when dealing with potentially lethal devices.
3,better version available,"I made this DVD and have updated the material. This seller does not have access to the updates, so please look for the version available directly from me with this same cover. The price is comparable. It is found in the same travel section on Amazon. Thanks"
4,Good stuff....,"It's been awhile since I've listened to this album (unfortunately I don't own it, I've heard a friend's copy), but I do remember that it's very good. ""Hiding In Waiting"" is done in a rather clever way, breaking it up into the ""Carrier"" and ""Receiver"" parts, both of which fit together perfectly, and yet both of which can be listened to independently of each other just as easily. The various remixes that I knew were also very good (""Adrenaline,"" ""Nothing,"" and ""Friends And Executioners""). All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable listening experience. 4 out of 5."
1,incomplete songs...the only complete thing is the rip-off,"I got complete ripped-off by buying this dvd,only 59 minutes long with a bunch of interviews and 10 second clips of songs,a waste of my hard earned money,might as well burn my 27$ in my fireplace...."
3,3:00 AM Classic,"Sure this is a big sloppy mess of a film, but it also has moments of pure surrealism that rival those of any desirable Jess Franco title. The snowy graveyard landscapes, erratic cuts, and pulsing music score also help contribute to the delerium. Graveyard Of Horrors is one of those offbeat one-of-a-kind Euro-horror's that was perfectly designed for those 3:00 AM viewings. I loved it."
2,So bad its good!,"Folks, If you're looking for insightful dialogue, great acting skills, production values or adequate continuity with this film... well... you're still looking.Having said that, this brings back memories of the Friday night frights of Sammy Terry (get it? Ceme tery?) on Channel 4 in Indianapolis. Where they dug these movies up is worthy of a term paper in college classes. To me, the film was disjointed, nonsensical, lame eroticism filled. I loved it! It had one redeeming value... a haunting tune that the director obviously fell in love with.. it's spliced into the film piecemeal, but I still remember it today. They played it on an organ, whistled it, and in one small segment, had a decent attempt of a small orchestral version of it. THAT is reason enough to buy the movie.Ive looked for this movie for 3 decades, erroniously believing it was directed by Mario Bava or His brother. The search is over, thanks to Amazon. Enjoy!"
3,the image of deranged,"This movie is very similiar to some of jess francos output from the same era. It's disjointed and it's filled with lots of images of disconnected scenes. It has strange pulsating music and the monster makes a strange howling noise while people fall in front of the camera. However it's still entertaining even if the whole movie is rather deranged. There is a general plot in this movie but you really have to pay attention to it to understand what's happening throughout the procedings. There is little actual violence in the movie but it's still fun for lovers of bad euro horror anyways. My main beef is with image the company that released this ,they made little attempts to clean up the scratches and dirt smudges. They have done the same thing with other fun but cheesy older horror movies as well. This is why I am going to email them and ask them to please clean up a movie before they sling it out to us. Alot of companies are taking the time to do this and so should they."
1,Just tell me...WHY???!,"I'm sure this film was a great ""make-out"" movie when it was first imported to the drive-ins HERE, but, when you NOW sit...on the sofa...confined...facing the TV...well, the only thing to say is, that a bottle of sedatives would be more ""cost-effective.""The only glint of excitement, was that the Cemetery Caretaker played by ""whatz-iz-name"" is the same actor who played the luggage Caretaker in ""HORROR EXPRESS"" (Victor Israel, for you videophiles LIKE ME)."
5,Beauty and power,"After Forever is a dream come true with those who like symphonic music, metal rock, and the female voice. I'm getting everything they have ever made, along with the music of Epica, Nightwish, and Within Temptation. Thanks to the Amazon.com writers who guide the uninitiated through symphonic rock or gothic metal--two names for this kind of music. This music can balance and compliment the male metal of Disturbed, Metallica, Mudvayne, and Korn."
3,Just another sampler,"If you want just a taste of some of the old Pitchfork stuff, then this CD is for you. It does include some important tracks such as the dancefloor hit ""Conjure"" from their second album Lam'Bras. However, if you want the real deal and own the first two albums, which IMHO were the best Pitchfork albums anyway, buy the Dhynai/Lam'Bras twin CD, available here at Amazon (look for the ""instead"" recommendation above)."
1,TOTAL WASTE,do not buy or rent! this is only an 18 minute clip of a band interview about appetite for destruction then it gets cut off. 18 minutes total. someone should take legal action against the people who put this together. i wasted money and it was false advertising. they'll be hearing about this!
3,A poet-president,"The film opens with an odd scene. Carlos Quintas (Andy Garcia), a Latin-American president living in exile, takes the night underground while dreams of his beloved, Kate (Kitty Aldridge). It's a good beggining for a promising story. The plot is clever, focusing on the strange relations between the superpowers (Great Britain, for instance), and the dictatorship of Carlos Quintas' country (any resemblance with all latin-american dictatorships in the 70's and 80's is not purely coincidental). There's good action and some pleasant moments, such as the poetry of the president (The verses belong, in fact, to chilean poet Pablo Neruda). The solution, however, is easy, even romantic, turning the film into any other ""Casablanca"" style. That's the reason this movie won't take 5. It deserves 3 stars, excellent for a cheap production."
1,very little for anyone here,"This book does a very poor job of presenting whatlittle information it contains.For the studio potter there is only one valuable piece of information:in electric firing, slow firing is good andlong soaks are better for proper glaze development.I've tried several of the cone 6 and cone 10 glaze recipes,the results were mostly awful. The technical discussionof materials and equipment is too brief to make thisa real resource in the studio. Most electric kilns nowcome with computer controllers, and there's nothing onhow to use them - just a few graphs of what an ideal firingcycle should look like.As other reviewers have noted, the black and white photographsdon't do justice to the pieces. Furthermore, the choice ofexamples is very biased towards the non-functional, sculptural,and just plain academic ugly. The overall presentation -choice of font, layout, and general lack of design alsocontributes to ones overall disappointment with this book."
5,"Yes, it's that good","For the children, the art is wonderfully warm and appealing so they just keep bringing it back to be read again.For the parents, it gets the kids to sit and be read to and, most importantly, the art is warm and comfortable enough and the prose lends itself to sound effects and play-acting so that you don't feel like fleeing the country when your child brings it up to be read for the 500th time.All of this series are very good but, in my opinion, this is the best of them all. In fact, it's my daughter's favorite book and has been for over 6 months. Now, that's a good book!Matt"
2,Not the same video I remembered.,I am going to give it to someone wanting a more graphic video than I remembered this to be. I wonder if it was reedited after it's release so many years ago and fully involved sex scenes added.
5,Each Page Will Leave You On The Edge Of Your Seat,Dr. Michael McGrath is at the top of his game as a murder mystery writer. A leading forensic psychiatrist in Upstate New York who gives us a compelling look into the world of madness with a plot that twists and turns till the very last page.
3,The Grandeur and Failure of Rome,"A well written, comprehensive history of Rome and its world. It is a pleasure to read, but with the following caveat: the author has an overtly religious, Christian outlook, as represented by this comment: ""I look upon the great civil wars of the Romans, which followed these conquests, in which so much blood was shed, and in which Marius and Sulla and Caesar and Pompey exhausted the resources of the state, and made an imperial regime necessary, only as the visitation of God in rebuke of such wicked ambition."" To call such ambition wicked and to attribute it to a visitation of God puts this author on my ""read but do not take too seriously"" list."
3,19th Century History Of Rome,"This is a very 19th century look at the history of Rome. While the author takes a definite moral stance, he isn't as dogmatic as some of them. Historians have moved away from the notion that moral laxity and love of luxury doomed Rome in the last century, so this makes an interesting contrast. And it's not nearly as long as Gibbon's ""Decline and Fall."""
2,risky buy,"i bought these speakers a couple of months ago but i don't know why i didn't chose to return them immediately. they don't fit my needs of a dorm room - the subwoofer is way too small (and it buzzes as another person also commented) and there is NO headphone outlet (meaning private listening is out of the question). the sound has been pretty clear up until tonite, when they totally failed on me. now it sounds like i'm listening out of two tin cans...but...there's a one year warranty on these. i'm definitely returning them to monsoon and crossing my fingers that this set was just a manufacturing defect. check out altec lansing speakers - they may not look as cool with the flat satellites, but i've never heard of them giving any one of my friends problems."
2,not happy,Unless I'm listening to music I have to keep these speakers turned off. When idle they give off really annoying buzzing and popping noises. I have Harman Kardon (sp?) speakers at work that I like far better. When I get around to it I'll junk these and buy some from HK.
2,The bass buzzes!,"I loved the look of these speakers, but they were so bad I had to return them. I brought them home, and the bass made a buzzing noice when turned past 1/4 volume. I am not sure whether my model was broken, or if the design is flawed, because when I put my hand over the air port it stopped the buzzing. So it seemed to me like the air port was poorly designed. But it is possible that I just had broken speakers. I would advise you to check these out in the store before you buy them. Cause without the bass problem they were good speakers, but the bass buzzing was too intolorable...."
1,"Speakers buzz, can't use them","I had a similar experience as another customer, unless I'm listening to music I have to keep these speakers turned off. When idle they give off really annoying buzzing and popping noises."
5,"Virginia Lopez,sings","Dear Friends, I recently aquired a recording of Virginia Lopez.That was proably recorded in he early 1960's.With the label Seeco sclp9102 It contains most of the songs that this compact disc has.And ifit is as good as this record i recommend it.She was out of this world!!!!Bravo!!!!! P.s.The name of the album is ""Virginia Lopez.sings""is this on C.D. by any chance?The vinyl sound pretty dam good for the period. Any comments?send them to AlvaroGuevara@webtv.net"
5,Beautiful voice,"I really enjoy this CD, her voice is so soothing and the guitar playing is heavenly...hard to sit still and not want to dance! I heard this lady sing back when I was a young girl, my aunts played her songs all the time. I don't even speak spanish but I still enjoy listening to it over and over again...great selection of songs."
5,You Want Al In BAD HAIR DAY,"Eventhough I got this CD from my friend, excellent songs. Amish Paradise, excellent song, but a misunderstood song from Coolio. My favorite Cavity Search. Excellent CD worth buying"
4,I hate to break the streak...,"I'm the 1st one here to give this CD lower than 5 stars. It is an awesome album, and it seemed to gain new fans. I had been listmeing to Weird Al all my life (I'm 15), and some of the stuff here wasn't up to the early stuff. But first, the high points... ""Amish Paradise"" and ""Gump"" are some of his best parodies. Two of the others are good too. ""Alternative Polka"" is his best polka ever. ""Since You've Been Gone"" rocks. & ""The Night Santa Went Crazy"" is awesome, but it may not top ""Xmas At Ground Zero."" Two other originals are lyrical pleasures. Weak points? ""Everything You Know Is Wrong"" is my least fave of the lyric-heavy originals. The worst parody here is the boring ""Syndicated Inc."" And the only notable thing about ""Callin' In Sick"" is the Nirvana-style. But despite these little things, Weird Al has never done a bad album and this is far from it!"
3,Alternative Parodies,"The problem with this album was mainly that at the time it was released, there were so few decent tunes for Al to parody. The record suffers due to the poor quality of popular artists which Al parodies. Even so, the album has its moments. There are many peppy songs here, some originals. The real gem is the last track, however. Especially good at Christmastime."
4,Something finally must have snapped... in his brain.,"This is a typical ""Weird Al"" album. Five parodies, six originals and a polka style medley of recent hit songs. Hey, it works for him, so why not stick with it? The best parodies this time around, in my opinion, are ""Amish Paradise"" and ""Gump"", with the others being just ""so-so"". The originals are of fairly high quality, with the standouts being the They Might Be Giants style song ""Everything You Know is Wrong"", the acapella doo wop song ""Since You've Been Gone"" and the Christmas song ""The Night Santa Went Crazy"". ""Weird Al"" fans (you know who you are) will dig it."
5,Best parodies,"Get all this guys CD's, there great. This one is very good. It features his hit ""gump"" (take off of ""gump"") about none other than forrest gump. It's very funny. I must say for the younger they may get scared, for the last song features santa bombing his workshop, and killing his reindeer and elves. I remember Larry may be a tad bit overboard, but just for SMALL kids. Anyone who understands this guys just playing will laugh really hard. I must say ""Running with scissors"" has better parodies, but this one is a good one. Buy it now! Amish Paradise will leave you in stiches."
4,Nice CD: Older songs with humourously re-written lyrics.,"Weird Al Yankovic does a wonderful job of taking older songs and re-writing their lyrics to make them very funny. About half of the songs on this CD are made in this format. The most recognized of these songs is ""Gansta's Paradise."" The rest of his songs are created by him."
4,Some pretty funny stuff,"""Weird Al"" Yankovic has been able to keep from being a one trick pony because of his uncanny ability to not only parody popular music, but create his own funny tunes. ""Amish Paradise"" is a wonderfully clever take on Coolio's hit, but it is some of his originals that really shine on this CD. ""Callin' In Sick"" is a great addition to the ""I don't want to work"" genre and ""I Remember Larry"" will make you worry for Al's sanity while you're laughing. Sure there are misses (another Polka Mix, ""Phony Calls"" a lame use of TLC's ""Waterfalls "")but overall this is a fun album that holds up under repeat plays and that's not a claim you can make for many comedy CD's."
5,The End of an Icon.......Kinda,"By icon, I mean the short-haired and glasses ""Weird Al."" The new him is almost better! Anyways, this has several must-hears, such as Amish Paradise and Gump. All the others are great too, so be sure to check this cd out, but also check out The Food Album, Poodle Hat, Running with Scissors and The Ultimate Video Collection!"
4,"Al yankovic, bad hair day album","I have liked weird Al's music for awhile. although this is my first time i bought a album by him. and i have to say i liked it a lot. you have to have a sense of humor to listen and enjoy his music. i bought it cause there were a few songs that i had not heard before like ''cavity search'' a parady of U2'S Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me and wanted to hear weird Al's take on it. i liked it a lot and i found myself having the song stuck in my head after i did listen to it. if your a fan of his you will like this cd and i love how weird Al can take pretty much any song and make it his own with his sense of humor he has. it makes you laugh and have a good time as you listen to his music."
5,THE...GREATTEST...ALBUM.....EVER!!!!!!!!!,"this is possibly the greatest album ever. it brings great joy to me when i listsen to it. but something is making me sad, which is a lot of reviews on this page. WHATS WITH THE INSULTS!!!! i mean come on, maybe 1-2 songs arent as good as they could be... this is still an amazing album, which is worth every cent. al is not falling, nor is he growing desperate. watch a concert on the poodle hat tour and you will see what i mean."
5,Al-fan Paradise,"You will be in Al-fan Paradise if you buy this CD. If you don't like it, then, Everything You Know Is Wrong. You might have to do a CD Search to get it in stock. You might consider Callin' In Sick to listen to it. Al 'll provide the Alternative Polka music for your birthday, Sven. If your friend played it Since You've Been Gone, you sure missed a great collection of music. Even Gump owns a copy, but I'm So Sick Of Him. Something-Something-Something-Something-Something-Something-Something Syndicaded Inc.. Do You Remember Larry? Hold on, I'm getting a Phony Call on The Night Santa Went Crazy. Get your amp ready."
1,My case arrived empty: I have yet to hear from the vendor.,"I have notified the vendor about two weeks ago that the case arrived empty and am waiting to hear from him. I very much want to review this item once I recieve the replacement. I have been out of the country these last two weeks, and expect that this is the reason for the delay. Mark C. Jones"
3,Weird Al,"Man, when I was 11 weird Al was rad! So I guess I cant hate on him. I liked Amish Paradise, Gump, Phony Calls alot. I knew Amish Paradise better than I knew Gangstas Paradise! Im not into this as much as I used to be, but hey, I was at one point, so if u like hi, go get it!"
4,weird al fifth best album,This album has some really good songs. Amish paradise is one his best parodies. cavity search is a very good parody of u2. Gump and phony calls are very good as well. Sindicated Inc. is all right parody. The night santa went crazy and since you've been gone are very good originals. The medly on this album is annoying. The rest of the originals are forgetable. overall this is a very good album.
5,Great CD,this cd is awesome. i love this cd. This cd containes weird al's most famous song. Amish Paradise. this is a great cd. the best songs on this disc are1. Amish Paradise2. Cavity Search3. Gump4. Phony Calls
5,Weird Al kicks ***!!!!!,"I love this CD. My favorite songs were Amish Paridise,Everything You Know Is Wrong,The Night Santa Went Crazy, and Gump.If you don't have this Cd, you should get it. It's the best cd ever. It kicks some major ***!!!!!!!! Weird Al is the best singer ever. If there is a concert I'm goin to it no matter what. Phony Calls rocks too!"
5,A really GR-8 album for now- or soon-to-be-fans!,This disc is really great. I enjoyed all the songs even the ones I didn't know the originals to. I think this disc is perfect for anyone ready for a fun and crazy time!!
3,"Works well, won't last.","When I first got this I thought it was GREAT it did rock my world. However it doesn't hold up. After about 5 or 6 uses it starts to break down. The rotating shaft starts to lock up, the battery cover slips off, etc. what a let down. the ""rabbit"" works really well but vibration is significantly reduced if you turn on the shaft. The 1.5"" diameter is definately a plus. I'm glad I got it (my first rabbit) but I won't put money into another one. As a matter of fact I wouldn't buy any one with a base like this."
4,Punk and Disorderly shows the new generation why punk rules!,"I bought the ""Punk and Disorderly"" series back in the 80's, when vinyl was still the first choice. The covers for these records were great. Finally available on CD, this compilation shows why punk is the best music around. From the Street Punk/Oi sounds of Blitz, to GBH and the Dead Kennedys, this comp covers a lot of the ground that these pioneers broke through in the still-early days of punk from around 1980 to 1985. Younger punks can hear the roots of today's bands, such as Rancid, in the sing-along anthems found here on this tasty platter. A must have for any punk."
5,The book was extremely useful during my pregnancy. I highly recommend it!,"The book was extremely useful during my pregnancy. It is a very reliable guide. It comprises answers to all the questions I had while pregnant. It contains useful information to understand what the father to be may be experiencing too. The book helped me to know what to expect in the delivery and to loose the fear I had about it. Clear, professional - certainly reliable."
3,What to do now,"I took the door of my 1997 Camry apart to make the handle change and found that the connecting rod in the door connected to the handle pointing 180 degrees from what the new handle wanted. ??? I spent a reasonable amount of time trying to figure out how to use the handle, but also how to get the old one out of the door. I finally gave up and put the door back together. The door handle I purchased seems to be slightly different from the one that came with my car including the mounting bolts. There are three places for the bolts to go and the original door handle used only 2. The new door handle only had threads in 2 holes of the 3 and I needed the third hole for mounting in my door. I found nothing really wrong with my new handle, but it is slightly different from my original one so I am planning to take the car to a shop and have the door handle replaced."
4,finally,Afcter looking for d parts and finfing them everywhere else real expensive i had the comfort of recieving at my house and they were what i was looking for.
1,Another disappointed customer,"I'm sorry to say that other reviews of this product from customers who really wanted it to work also apply to my experience. The software loaded on my Mac (OS X 10.4.7), but then the trouble started. The software USB driver could not seem to keep the pen captured, and when it did, scanning was haphazard. Not that it mattered, because try as I might (and believe me, I am a very careful troubleshooter), I could not get a scan that was clear enough or stable enough for IRIS to recognize. This is too bad, because the IRIS engine in general is fast and accurate in other Mac applications ... and is what led me to give this product a try. Thank you as always to Amazon for your customer-friendly return policies!"
1,A failure of a product,"It is scandalous that this proudct advertises it works with the Mac -- it's a handheld disaster. With 10.4.7, it will freeze your Mac and require rebooting. I seriously doubt they have spent any time trying to update the drivers for any changes to the operating system in years. Save your time and money, and pass on this."
3,Not as good as I had hoped for,It's hard to check your tires with this without letting air out of your tires. I will be buying a much better one that hopefully will be easier to check the air in the tires without letting air out. Even for the low price I wouldn't recommend this one.
3,"Okay, but not great","The price was right so I bought a few of these. I do not find them very easy to use. They have to be perfectly lined up to get a reading and not let air out of the tire. The display is not that readable either. At the price, they are okay, but not great."
4,Lovely Product,Small lovely product. Does what it's meant to do. Can easily be carried every were you go. Love it.
3,"Cheap, accurate, you'll need a new one in a year.","I got this at a brick-and-mortar store for pretty much this price. I was surprised at how accurate it was considering the price. It does require some coordination to get it sealed properly, but it's not that difficult.The main problem that spurred me to give this review is the fact that I tried to use it yesterday after several months without touching it and got a low battery indicator. I haven't even had it for a year, and only used it a few times! From what I remember, the packaging (long thrown-away) says the battery is not user-replaceable.I'd rather get something a bit more expensive but that will last."
2,Didn't last long,I purchased this item reading the reviews and the product details where it mentions permanent battery life but I ran out of battery in 6 months after use and changing battery is a hassle with this accutire gauze. It has not even been a year and it's sitting like crap on my keychain. I will not recommend people to buy it.
1,waste of money. going to the trash.,This was dead on arrival. No display when trying to measure. It's supposed to have a lihium lifetime battery. This is a total waste of money.
2,Battery turns on only after opening case/checking battery,"The gauge didnt turn on at first, turns out there was a small strip of plastic covering the battery that I had to remove by opening the case. Requires a very small screwdriver!"
4,Worked so well I had to get another one,"I was trying to put air in my tires at a gas station near my home but was having difficulty. Happens that the rep from the company that supplies the air machine was near by and saw me struggling. He came to help and realized the hose was bad, so he replaced it. He filled my tires for me and used my digital tire gauge to check the pressure. He was so impressed with this little gadget I had to give it to him... hence I had to buy myself a new one.I find it easy to use. I never let more than a very little air out of the tire when I'm putting it on. Once it's on, it seals pretty well and there shouldn't be anymore air loss. It reaches the tire pressure quickly and it's easy to read while still on the tire. I purchased several for gifts.The old fashion type is good, but I can never seem to find it when I need it. I hang this in my car and it's always right where I can find it."
5,Handy and accurate,Accutire key chain very handy and useful good item for the price. Tire pressure very important for family safety
1,"SUCKS, IT'S A TOY! Is not giving proper pressure.","Accutire MS-4652B Key Chain Digital Tire Gauge BlackTHIS SUCKS! IT IS A TOY! IT DOES NOT GIVE THE CORRECT PRESSURE!Looks Nice, but just extra weight to carry around.Thanks for the TOY!!!"
4,Great little gauge with a minor first-time-use issue (fixable!),"Pros:-very compact to keep handy in your pocket or small compartments-digital readout good under the right lighting conditions-key chain-accurate-inexpensive-batteries are replaceableCons:-you need to line it up properly to get a good reading, you'll let out air after each failed attempt-no back light, you'll need a another lighting source to read it-non-angled head, you'll get into some awkward positions to properly see the screen-small first-time-use hiccup (explained below)When receiving the unit, you must pull a red plastic tab which unblocks the batteries so the electricity will flow. I ripped it off and the unit failed to work on the first try. If this happens to you, you must open the battery compartment and remove whatever plastic might remain to ensure the two batteries are touching.Minor annoyances, but a very handy little tool."
3,Good Not Great,"At first the tire gauge seemed to be handy since it could be hook to my key chain, however if you have many keys on your ring like I do, it becomes annoying trying to use it. It worked well at gauging , no problems there, but sometime in 2010 the chain broke and due to it's small size it was gone for good. I recommend just tossing it in your glove box and not worry about the key ring feature."
2,not worth the $7,"The price on this gauge is low but I wouldn't get it again even if it was free. As other reviewers mentioned, the gauge is tricky to put on the tire. Once attached it's difficult to get an accurate reading because it often comes off. This is frustrating and causes you to second guess the reading. After about a year of use the gauge quit working altogether."
5,Perfect for a woman,"I haven't tried this tire guage yet, but it shipped very fast and is great for my key chain."
3,Nice little air gauge,Nice small air gauge easy to carry and easy to use. A little problem holding gauge waiting for gauge to read but at least it seems to be accurate !!
5,Quick and simple tire pressure gauge,"I needed a inexpensive and accurate tire pressure gauge, and this fits the bill nicely. Small and compact, this pressure gauge only needs a couple of seconds for a reading, and you can use it again within a second. All you need is to make a good seal so that air doesn't leak out of the tire when you are making a measurement, which is pretty easy to do once you had a couple of experiences using this gauge. Doesn't get better than this if all you need is a no-frills and simple-to-use pressure gauge."
2,Works great. But product dies when the battery goes dead,"The Accutire MS-4652B Key Chain Digital Tire Gauge is great. Very good quality at an unbelievable low price. I looked at several products and this one blows away the competition. The product is very accurate and compact to carry. The only downside to this product is that you will need to push the device in the tire valve several times to get an accurate reading. Therefore, it will take you 2 or 3 tries before you get a correct reading. But remember that each try is about one second, so no big lost of time. HERE IS A BIG NEGATIVE POINT: ONCE THE BATTERY GOES LOW OR DIES, THEN THE ENTIRE PRODUCT DIES AS WELL. THIS MEANS YOU CAN NOT REPLACE THE BATTERY. THE PRODUCT WILL NOT WORK. I TRIED EVERYTHING INCLUDING SEVERAL NEW BATTERIES AND IT WILL NOT WORK AGAIN. CHECK OUT THE OTHER REVIEWS AND YOU WILL SEE OTHER CUSTOMERS SAYING THE SAME THING."
1,nearly impossible to use without deflating tire,"The gauge has to be e-x-a-c-t-l-y lined up or else you won't get a reading. Worse yet, you'll deflate your tire. I've lost 5psi out of a 30psi tire once trying to use this."
3,"Okay. Works fine, but it is too long for my bike tire.","I bought this to put on the key ring with my motorcycle key. I figured it would be convenient to check my tires before every ride. it works great for the front tire, but it is too long to wedge it between the rim and the stem. So, I can't use it on my back tire. I am currently looking for a shorter tire gauge. This will go great on my car keychain, though! Works great and it's quality has lasted so far."
2,Worked ok but literally self-destructs when power source removed or dead,"I changed the battery and other reviewers are correct stating that it won't work afterward. It's as if it has a damaged circuit board, the characters are incoherent now and change around randomly when trying to measure. If this is actually done deliberately by accutire, in order to try to boost sales by customers looking for a replacement, I truly hope it doesn't work. Out of spite, I'm going to avoid any accutire products for as long as I can remember to. ENCODE: AVOID ACCUTIRE FOR LIFE!! Please don't forget, dear brain..."
1,Nice Picture... when it works,"I would give this no stars if I could. I have had nothing but problems with this television and Samsung in general. I am on my 3rd round of replacement parts with this. It started shutting itself off and on by itself 3 days after I bought it. The repair lasted about 6 months, then the problem just recently started again. I just had the plasma panel replaced...everything except for the housing. And it is still screwed up. Now I have a 4""x10"" vertical line with a laser-like line up the middle of it. Yeesh, this thing sucks! I would say I just had a bad apple, but I also bought the Hp-4252 for my home and 4 for work. In just over a year, they all had problems with laser lines and black sections. Those were just out of warranty of course. STAY AWAY FROM SAMSUNG PLASMA DISPLAYS. Buy any other brand."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This tv was delivered about 10 days after I ordered and white glove service was great. A week later it started powering off and on by itself. I called Samsung, and was refered to a technician. He told me he would bring the parts that could be causing the problem. On the day of the appointment he was late, brought no parts or tools, and stayed under 10 minutes. He tried to do a software update even though the tv was new, repeated that about 8 times, then said ""I don't have what I need to fix this, we'll call next week"" and left. He never called. White glove picked it up today, 48 hours after I called them. Amazon is giving me a full refund since I never want a Samsung product again. Don't be fooled by the initial quality of this tv. It's like a shiny used car that dies 10 minutes after you drive it off the lot, and Samsung acted like a used car salesman. On the upside Amazon has the best customer service I've ever experienced and I'll certainly buy my next tv from them. Just not a Samsung."
5,Awesome TV,"Great TV, Great picture quality. Great price.The samsung 6374 is fantastic. The image quality is superb. I have a 46 inch lcd and 50 inch plasma in other rooms of the house and this TV blows them away. It really gives you a home theater experience with size and quality. images are not pixelly and are unbelievably sharp. my TV guy says it's one of the nicest TVs he's ever seen and he generally works with higher end, luxury type consumers."
5,A Must Buy!,This is an excellent video for both Muslims and non-muslim brothers and sisters. A great one for non-muslim to give them a true picture of Islam and this video will remove all the misconception of your mind. It gives you an introduction of Islam and its factors.
3,Good But Not Great,"As a researcher of religion, especially Christianity and Islam, I must say the video is not a ""closer look"" into Islam as the title implies. I felt it was too short and (without denying the bias of it being a pro-Islam presentation) included some propaganda that did not allow the video to be presented objectively enough to be called a true introduction to Islam. The portion of the video dedicated to women in Islam discussed much about the equality of women in Islam (which I applaud) yet unfairly left out even an utterance of topics such as Surah 4:34 which deal with male superiority to women and such. Nevertheless, the video was good enough for me to want to show it to my Intro to Islam class. I give it three stars!"
3,This Video Grossly Distorts the Normal Role of Women in Islam,"Did Islam ever consider women to be equal to men? If so, there is little evidence of such an attitude in the last 400 to 500 years. The current reality is that even the more moderate interpretations of Islam place men in the proverbial driver's seat. This politically correct video originally aired in 1995 leaves much to be desired. Those being interviewed essentially ignore the Islamic nihilists who threaten our very existence. They are treated, at best, as a minor nuisance. Islam:a Closer Look is only a half hour long. There is a possibility that it might help you learn why our guard down was down on 9/11.David ThomsonFlares into Darkness"
1,Very Disappointing Video,"When I got the video, I thought that I would see an unbiased view of the religion, but unfortunately, what I got was a one-sided view and basically a propaganda for Islam. This video is [one sided]"
2,It's Like They Don't Even Try Anymore,"First: The Flaming Lips are one of my favorite bands. Some of their albums have had transcendental effects on my worldview, beginning in high school and extending into my thirties.But: Nowadays they sound like Sade.Finally: People are going to buy this record, no matter what. And given the amount of hype, who's to say that they shouldn't see what all the hubbub is about firsthand. But, if you're going to buy this, at least make sure you also own In a Priest Driven Ambulance and Hear It Is too."
5,They've carved out their own territory and continue to flesh it out with audacity.,"This is written for the uninitiated, not those in the fold, so to speak. The Flaming Lips will either entice or enrage, there's not a lot of wiggle room. Either their unique, psychadelic-tinged aural-pop landscape adventures will grab you or you'll want to throw something at them. ""At War With the Mystics"" just continues to amaze and surprise. Could be their best. Easily. This stuff is downright subversive and it crawls into your consciousness. . .unless you're immediately turned off because it hits you as fingers-on-the-blackboard sonic overload. Sgt. Pepper, Pink Floyd, They Might Be Giants, XTC, Saturday morning cartoons, great commercial jingles. . .heck, forget it. You can't compare them to anyone. Up for a challenge? C'mon follow the rabbit down the hole. . . Alice is there standing next to her looking glass and will welcome the company."
3,"Solid, but a bit inconsistent","There are some great tracks; there are some bad tracks; there are some tracks that make me say: ""hmm, ok."" The album, as a whole, also causes me to say that. It's not great, not bad, but definitely not that special.When this album is great, it's really great, with tracks like ""New Radicals,"" ""The Yeah Yeah Yeah Song,"" ""Mr. Ambulance Driver,"" and ""The W.A.N.D."" And when it's bad, it's really bad; think ""Vein Of Stars,"" ""Haven't Got A Clue,"" and ""It Overtakes Me,"" which starts out catchy and fun, but meanders and then eventually drops into 4 minutes of pure junk.""The W.A.N.D."" is perhaps the best song of the year, but the album itself doesn't follow suit. It is, however, a very solid effort from a very solid studio act."
4,my first flaming lips album - i'm impressed,"The music sounds experimental, political, and generally fresh (despite the pink floyd/classic rock influence) - i find this to be an enjoyable listen.. I am not quite up to par with those who consider it a masterpiece (but those people obviously have a connection with the band and their music.. whereas i am a helpless rookie).. I would consider it very artistic - yet with an edge that might be commercially driven (who can blame them).. very well done.."
4,the next lips phase,"knowing their music and it's strange and wonderful journey, this is just the next phase. hands down, the soft bulletin is their best work--even they might admit it. but this is the music of today's influences, and if the YEAH song doesn't tell you that, then you just aren't listening. this is the cue for the album: big sound, multi-timbral, and still distorted and disonant with harmony at the core. It's their punk style, their source of soul, and never boring. but be warned: you won't 'get it' in one sitting--you will have to listen to it over and over again. not a bad way to spend your time."
3,they might be human after all....,"well, it was bound to happen eventually. the lips have finally released a record that isn't completely amazing. up until now, their consistent greatness rivaled stalwarts like fugazi and built to spill. i've never seen the lips live before ""soft bulletin,"" but i'm wondering if there was always such a, how should i put it, ""theatrical"" element to the band? anyway, this is by no means a bad record, but judging it next to ""bulletin,"" ""yoshimi,"" ""hit to death"" and ""priest driven ambulance"" is like comparing a pocket flashlight with a quasar."
3,DJ STORBY SPEAKS,"I rushed out and bought the CD the first day it came out. When I heard the first song.. I said to myself...I waited for this????? What a disappointment!!!The first 2 songs should have been left on a B side some where..The political overtones need to go...The lyrics do not hold a candle to previous works.Things got better on track 3 and the rest of the CD is good, but?...Too Bad The Wand has the word Mother F.....in it.It will keep me from playing it at kid shows......bummer!!!I have seen the LIPS in concert. They put on a Fantastic show. I will go to see them in Austin September 15I hope they play their old stuff..???Please no yeah yeah song...I hope????I wonder what BECK thinks???I am still waiting for the first 2 songs to grow on me!Not Yet!!!"
1,Complete waste of time and money,"I read the reviews, trusted them, and much to my disappointment, no one was honest. For those of you who have high speed internet, check out Rhapsody, you can listen to the whole album free. Anyone else hesitating on buying the CD, I'll be selling mine for the lowest price here. The brown mark washes off."
2,where is songwriting? who is bad singer?,"i think there are a few good songs on the cd. but some of the tunes are long and boring with bad singing. i like the way wain cone sings but he is'nt always lead singing on theis cd. another person with a plain generic voice is sing on a few songs. i really like wayne con's voice better!!! there are a few highlights on this cd but they just aren't enough of them to carry the cd. it is neat on yeah yeah yeah song when wane coin's voice comes in on top of the yeah yeah yeah part!!! the w.a.n.d. song is really good for the most part. if you like the last album robot and yoshimi then you might like this one too, cuz i dont care for that one either"
2,"Not ""Soft Bulletin II"" or ""Yoshimi...""","""Anyone expecting The Soft Bulletin II"" or ""Yoshimi: The Sequel"" will be disappointed"" - And I was."
2,Would have been better without trite politics,Okies living in the Entertainment Industry bubble read dailykos and taint their art.
2,A different view,"After reading the raving reviews on this album I decided to buy it. Alas, I shouldn't have. I expected experimental, interestingmusic. Instead I hear a lot of seventees-style disco and a lot of humor that isn't funny at all. I do not hear sincerity or a truly original voice, just a pstiche of styles. Listen before you buy!"
4,They can't all be classics,"Hey, so it's no Yoshimi and it's no Soft Bulletin. Well, the White Album by the Beatles was no Abbey Road and I have 'em both.It's the Flaming Lips, it's melodic, it's weird and there might be a song or two you might skip over. Not me, I listen to them all when I play it. I ain't like that.It takes a while to absorb, allow it to sink in."
4,better than Soft Bulletin? Not a problem!,"I had to write in this review. Overall I think this album is above average to say the least. but the main reason for writing in this review is to make all the Soft Bulletin fanatics angry.because I keep reading reviews by Flaming Lips fans that think that SB is heaven on earth while I think its all mediocre at best with no really good songs. I admit I bought Yoshimi first and fell head over heels for it, but what is so speciial about SB?"
3,just not impressed...,"What more can I say? I was so looking forward to this release, but after listening to it several times, it just doesn't do much for me. It strikes me as...lazy. Where is the creative, innovative, cutting edge, fun music I have come to love? This is too much of a nod to the past."
2,Songs for the next Apple commercial,"Six years ago it was great to hear the Lips (somewhat ironically)riffing on Yes & Zep all wraped up in a Floydian-indie package - but that was SIX YEARS AGO!! Yoshimi came out and was a big yawn, then the songs started poping up on TV commercials (sigh). This new album has even worse songs but has more sound effects to hide them. I love the Lips, but this is stale music. Hope they get their creative spark back in the future and stop treading water in ""Cutesy Sonic-Landscapeland"".I listened to it twice then had to put on C. Beefheart's ""Bat Chain Puller"" just to hear something with some creative intensity."
5,"My jaw dropped off, but after putting it on again, it fell off again!","Jebus this is great. The cover even yells out to me, ""BUY this freakin album dude, you know you want to"" Really cool lookin. I love the Flaming Lips. Those oklahoma boys know how to rock and make something new and exciting. I think Yoshima just got ran over by the War of the mystics. I love everything they do from Oh My Gawd and beyond. They are easily becoming one of my top 10 favorite bandarenos. They are really cool and bizarre and weird and crazy, saw them live on PBS in Austin Texas, there were balloons everywhere and people dressed like animals, he even sang Somewhere Over the Rainbow with his very own dad on sax Lips style, very awesome indeed. This band is great. Love every minute of every bit of music they ever do and especially this fine addition to their collection, AT WAR WITH THE MYSTICS!! later."
5,A great Flaming lips album,"i liked the flaming lips before, but this cd made me love them. Its a great all around flaming lips cd, crazy, but good"
3,"I'm a fan, but I'm also objective","I'm a huge Lips fan, but frankly this release will be collecting dust when years from now I'll still be listening to ""soft bulletin"", ""yoshimi"", ""transmissions from the satellite heart"", etc. I'll be the first to admit Wayne and his cohorts are creative, but that doesn't always translate into music that makes a lasting impression. The Lips have achieved such a cult status they could release a cd of nothing but test tone warbles and all the lemmings out there would still give it 5 stars."
3,Some songs are awesome,"Just like I said in the title. Cool band but, Coyle has to take a knee sometimes when it comes to lyrics and melody. I love the dude though."
5,I can't stop listening...,"As much as I loved Yoshimi, I figured that there was no way The Lips could follow it up with anything that could compare. I was wrong. I have been playing this album non-stop since I bought it, and it keeps getting better with each listen! I think what I like the most is the trippy 70's sound... not only do they remind me of Pink Floyd, but also a little like ELP. Also, many of the songs are so catchy (especially ""Free Radicals"" and ""It Overtakes Me"") that I WAKE UP to the songs playing in my head, and I find myself singing them throughout the day. And that's a good thing."
3,"Contrasts/Kontrasts is just as good,and CHEAPER","I was quite desperate for this book to come out,I first heard about it like 3 YEARS ago and have been waiting for it impatiently ever since.Since I love Michel Comte's work,I bought Contrasts/Kontrasts Portfolio from Stern Portfolio Library.It was nothing short of breathtaking,it had something for everyone,every taste.And I THOUGHT Faces would be the same,only it would be an entire BOOK'S worth.Also,since Michel Comte was the one who actually discovered her,I was certain alot of his work with model Jenny Shimizu would be included(I'm a tad obsessed with her:o).NOPE,not ONE picture.Many of the same pictures are in both books,in fact Contrasts/Kontrasts actually has alot more of his fashion photography than Faces does.Don't get me wrong,it's a beautiful book,all I'm saying is Contrasts/Kontrasts is really just as good,VERY similiar,and a heck of alot cheaper."
5,mUcH cOoLeR!!,"this i-zone camera is so much cooler!its very sleek and unlike the old i-zone cam. this one has sleek FLAT controls!!(the other i-zone had the controls sticking up so if you put it in your pocket,briefcase... it would turn on itself and use up the battery)if like the coolest i-zone pics AND wanna save battery get THIS camera.RoCk On!!"
2,Rip off,"While the camera works fine, the film is so expensive that it is difficult to refill. This is not recommended as a gift, especially for younger people, to whom the ads seem to be aimed."
2,Not Worth It,"The Polaroid i-zone camera was definately not worth the money I spent on it. The pictures are so tiny you can barely make out what's in them, plus the film is sooo expensive. If your willing to spend all your money on film then I guess it's an okay camera, but it's not even that much fun to use."
1,Oh NO!,This book was VERY disappointing. First of all the hard cover leads you to believe that the book is of a reasonable size. It's more like a Children book size. Many of the pictures are old and seemingly out of date. I was duped! I also bought his other book at the same time called Derriere and was equally disappointed. WATCH OUT and don't get duped like I did.
1,Just another book,"Old pictures , not as good as expected, a waste of money., one of best picture is on the cover , you can find similar images ont he internet for free."
4,"If you like spaced out acid jams, this one's a no brainer!","When I discovered ""Space Box"" at amazon.com I had two completely opposite reviews staring me in the face. One said it was garbage and the other said it was great. I decided to take a chance, since it was priced so economically. Boy, am I glad I did! If you like such artists as Helios Creed, Cluster, Chrome, Hawkwind and Faust, snag this one right now. Listen to these CD's a couple of times and you're liable to find yourself dialing up a few of your old friends in search of a handful of tabs! Get out your synchro-energizer and let the likes of Guru Guru and Amon Duul II take you on a little departure from our world. Actually, better make that a little departure from our galaxy! So, you ask, do I like ""Space Box""? Get real. I don't like it. I love it! If you don't scarf up this set now, don't come crying to me later about how you have to shell out $50 to get it from some used CD store. I'll only say ""I told you so""."
2,"A little cheesy, i'm sure you'd agree.","While some material on this cd is quite good (Hawkwind, Cluster, Harmonia, the older stuff) the tracks by most of the newer bands are just plain silly, uninventive shlock that makes for filler. Try a Faust or Can album, or some Fripp/Eno stuff before wasting time on this one. The worst part is that the box is so cheesy, not to mention the typos (the worst being the exclusion of song 6 on cd 2 in the track listing -- come on, cleopatra, don't you hire someone to check these things?)"
2,Don't expect much,"I got this mainly because I walk a LOT and have a spot on both heels that has blistered over and over and is very thick and I wanted to get it down to soft skin. Short of using an orbital sander, I thought I'd try a tool like this, but it really isn't meant for tough callouses. You can't put ANY pressure on it, or the spinning disc will stop. So, now I just have very smooth, shiny thick spots on my heels, which wasn't really my aim.I would have given it the minimum # of stars, but the pumice sponge and lotion in the kit is actually pretty nice. But you can probably buy those separately for less money."
4,Fun stuff,"Price is reasonable, products are fun to use. All sorts of nifty attachments. Won't last forever, but who cares. If you get a half a dozen pedicures out of it in the comfort of your own home on your own schedule - it's more than worth what you paid."
1,Terrible,"I live in an apartment, and din't want to invest heavily in a screen door. I expected this to be sort of junky, but to get the job done. No such luck.Think of one of those pop-up hampers- the ones with the metal wire frame, that come tghtly packed in a circle, and then it pops up when you take the elastic band off it. That's what this screen is. Same frame, same mesh. Exteremly flimsy. The 'hook and loop' attachement system is VELCRO.I would have returned this product. But, I waited too long and couldn't. The return policy is very short.Since it couldn't be returned, I attempted to install it. The velcro fell off the door frame. The screen itself is warped. It doesn't get the job done."
1,a waste of ur money,"this screen door is a waste of ur money. the frame is very weak & can definitely not serve as a functional door or simply a screen to keep your pets in (unless u want to lose ur pets). the screen door definitely instantly falls apart. and yes, it is very ugly. i would return it except i wouldn't get refund for shipping/handling & the shipping costs as much as item. if any of u wanna buy this screen door, y don't u stop by my apt and i will give u mine...."
1,Is this a joke?,This thing is hideous. It's enormous. I can't imagine the door this would fit nicely like in the picture. That picture can not be of the same monstrosity that I received. I'm too embarassed to actually install this thing and have other people see it. I knew it was too good to be true. Such a waste!
4,works as adveertised,these sticks really make a difference over the course of an evening if you have some joint pain. they are a bit underweight due to the hollowing for the rubber anti-vibe plugs and the rubber sometimes catches on your pant leg but it's all i use anymore.
5,Weird Al clasic,"This is for the true Weird Al lover. You should have it in your collection if only for ""The Biggest Ball Of Twine In Minnesota"""
4,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,This is a pretty good weird al albumMONEY FOR NOTHING/BEVERLY HILLBILLIES: 4/5 Good songATTACK OF THE RADIOACTIVE HAMESTERS FROM A PLANET NEAR MARS: 3/4 Ok songISLE THING: 5/5 Good song about Gilligans IslandTHE HOT ROCKS POLKA: 3/5 An ok polkaUHF: 5/5 The best song on the albumSHE DRIVES LIKE CRAZY: 4/5 Good songGENERIC BLUES: 1/5 BoringSPAM: 5/5 2nd best song on the albumTHE BIGGEST BALL OF TWINE IN MINNESOTA: 5/5 Good song about al taking his kids to see the biggest ball of twine in minnesota
4,A Forgotten Classic,"This is some of Weird Al's strongest work from the 1980s. It has some material directly from the movie UHF, but a lot of very good songs as well. ""Generic Blues,"" ""Spam,"" and ""The Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota"" are the highlights for me and still make me laugh even after more than 20 years. This album also demonstrates what a good songwriter Yankovic is; he can mimic any style or artist even without directly parodying a song. I highly recommend this to any Weird Al fan looking to fill out a collection."
4,Weird Al Goodness!,"Not gonna lie: I'm a HUGE Weird Al fan, but I wasn't a huge ""UHF"" fan. This soundtrack is pretty brilliant. Some of his best parodies are included on this CD, including ""She Drives Like Crazy"" and ""Beverly Hillbillies"". If you're a Weird Al fan, this album is a MUST-HAVE for your collection. The same goes for if you're a fan of the film. Casual listeners will enjoy the brilliant comedic laughs found all over. Great stuff!"
4,YANKOVIC IS SOME SORT OF GUY!!!!,"If you buy this album, you will never need any other form of entertainment. Just disconnect your internet access and seal yourself in your room and play this album over and over again at volume 11. If the cops bust down your door, then challenge them to a polka duel."
3,Way Too Many Fillers!,"This CD is okay, but there are a lot more filler songs than Weird Al usually has. Sure, I love Beverly Hillbillies, UHF, Isle Thing, Gandhi II, and She Drives Like Crazy, but the rest of the songs are really weak. I would've like The Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnestota, but it is way too long, almost seven minutes!"
4,Excellent album from a very talented guy!,"This album was released in 1989, and is in part the soundtrack to ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's movie UHF, but most of its contents is not included in the movie. On this album, included in the movie, is the song ""Money For Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies,"" the movie's theme ""UHF,"" two clips from the movie, and an instrumental called ""Fun Zone."" All of those are quite good.However, there's also a lot of great stuff on this album that is not included in the movie, such as ""The Hot Rocks Polka,"" which is a polka medley of Rolling Stones songs. There are also some great parodies, along with some great originals. My favourite song on here is an original called ""Generic Blues."" Now, that one can sure crack listeners up!A must-have for all ""Al-oholics!"""
3,Rerun,"Like the cop at the scene of an accident:""Move along! There's nothing to see here! Now move along!""If you have the first disks there's nothing here worth the admission. Buy the disk and give it away to generate other fans."
4,Be careful when buying Chrome Box...,"The Cleopatra-issued release sold here differs from the Subterranean Records release. Missing from this Cleopatra release are the aforementioned ""Shadows of 1000 Years"" plus ""ST 37"" and several others. It's still a great box set at a great price, but it's not as comprehensive as the Subterranean Records release, which includes ALL the songs from Alien Soundtracks, Half Machine Lip Moves, Blood on the Moon and No Humans Allowed. FYI."
4,My bad...it does contain Shadows of 1000 Years...,"but does not contain All Data Lost, SS Cygni, Nova Feedback, ST 37, Critical Mass, RM 101, Night of the Earth, The Strangers, and about 1/2 of No Humans Allowed."
4,"An interesting, inexpensive instant camera.","I got this camera the other day, about a half an hour before I was to go out with friends. In only about 3 minutes, I had already snapped off my first shot. The JoyCam is incredibly easy to use, however, it may be so easy that you'll accidentally set it off. I'm disappointed with its bulky body as it makes it a little hard to just slip it out of your backpack or purse, but its form may be actually advantageous for smaller hands and fingers. The picture quality is what I had expected for a Polaroid camera of the suggested price. I took shots of a building from a speeding car and still pictures close-up, and the quality remained consistant. The images came out pretty clear, although the color quality after using the flash leaves something to be desired. All in all, I'm happy with this purchase. Instant photographs are a novelty in itself, and the JoyCam makes it easy on your wallet."
3,Not complaining,"This is my first Polaroid and suits me just fine, for a very good price. The pictures are smallish, about 2.5-3.0 inches by 2 inches. The quality is fair, fine for everday shots."
4,Its fun!,"I've had my JoyCam for a year now and its become a regular feature at parties. My friends love it and so do I. Now it doesn't replace having real photos which I still take...and you can't do anything fancy with it...but it is fun! Looking from the logical side - the camera itself is quite cheap and the film relatively expensive - about $... for 10 pictures. The camera is lightweight plastic, fairly large in size and not at all high tech.....but looking from a purely fun factor I love it! You get instant pictures at parties and I scan them and share them with friends the next day so we all have copies. The novelty value still hasn't worn off with my friends...perhaps we're just easy to please :-)"
1,polaroid joycam instant camera,"This camera seems very flimsy, came with poor instructions and did not come with film. I could not find any mention of the type of film to use. I went out and bought a different polaroid camera which cost a bit more but it was much better and came with a pack of film to start you out."
4,Phantasmagoria Live!,"Half the songs are off of the Phantasmagoia LP and includes that lineup. This is the last show of their 85-86 tour in Santa Cruz, CA. These songs live have alot more energy and are 'rougher' than the studio versions (which is great). Dave actually plays 2nd guitar on a couple songs - best song has to be ""there'll come a day"". Is it a Dream sounds excellant too - kinda like Smash it up during the Chorus! Naz Nomad even gets in the set. The country intro. to Disco Man was funny. You can hear the crowd during during slow parts and in betweens etc..""Scabies is a wanker"" do I hear? and you can feel the energy - after 22 years they still are more exciting than any 'new alternative' band live. I've only seen them twice recently and on a few videos. If you like the Damned get this CD even if Phantasmagoria is not your fav LP. Someone please sign them to a new record deal!! Even if Captain is still a Wanker!Hanz Pozzo"
3,Not what it seems...,"The packaging included a picture of a ticket stub from a gig in Anaheim CA in 1985 but that IS NOT the concert on the CD. It is actually from the Woolwich Coronet on July 11th, 1985 on their home turf during the Phantasmagoria tour. Several songs were included on a U.K. 12"" single (GRIMT3), the a-side being a re-mix of 'Is It A Dream'. The live b-sides were Street Of Dreams, Curtain Call, Pretty Vacant and Wild Thing. The last two were left off this release as they were (1) already available as b-sides, (2) cover versions and (3) not particularly good (or necessary to make this a cohesive/coherent live album.). Anyway, the CD contains not the California gig but a gig from England in the summer of 1985. And a pretty good one too."
3,MONSTER A GOOF-GOOF!!!!!!!,"MONSTER A GO-GO - This movie was not all that bad. I have to amid is was a little long drawn out, but themonster was cool looking. I just wish they showed more of him. Still it is a good B-movie to watch.PSYCHED BY THE 4-D WITCH - This movie was STUPID! STUPID! STUPID! Just a sex farce. And just like thecompany implies: Something Weird! No one under 40 should view this movie. And no one should cut downEd Wood Jr. for compared to this, his movies are masterpieces. I give this movie only 1 star and I thinkthat is being kind."
1,Stay far far away,"Monster a Go Go is the dullest movie I have ever seen in a mere 68 minutes of screen time. It is basically 60 minutes of people sitting around tables talking about boring-as-hell crap, and 8 minutes of extremely boring non-violent ""action"". If you count seeing a helicopter land (not crash) as ""action"". The so-called monster is on screen literally for less than 10 seconds of screen time, and you only ever see him interact with another character once. Briefly.It's nice they included extras, but they are extremely forgettable nudie cuties from the 60s.Psyched by the 4-D Witch is basically a psychedelic nudie cutie. Again, forgettable.Oh yes, and Monster A Go Go has literally the worst ending I've ever seen in a film - and I have watched such stinkers as Nightmare City and King Dinosaur.The only conceivable purpose for this DVD set might be as a white-elephant giveaway at a party where you dont' like any of the other participants."
5,Worthy successor to The Elephant's Baby,"The first time I heard Clare Fader and the Vaudevillains perform was in a smoky nightclub in Durham, NC. I was hooked instantly. After listening to The Elephant's Baby, their first album, more times than I can count, buying copies for my friends for their birthdays (or just for the heck of it), I was thrilled to see that a new album was on the way. Seventh and Trade was worth the wait. Clare and the Vaudes continue to invent music that evolves and finds new expression even as it retains the power to transport you to a seductive past. ""Tain Ya Ta Bain Mei Ren Gui"", sung in Cantonese, is worth the price of admission all by its lonesome. This music is destined for a wide audience, and Seventh and Trade is a perfect stop at which to hop on board."
3,"Well written, but so, so wrong.","Two of the great critic/theorists of the 20th century--Wayne Booth and Kenneth Burke--had a tendency to write engagingly but read uncritically. Booth, in this entertaining defense of practical reason, misreads 20th century philosophy, conflating critical rationalism and logical positivism. In doing so he sets up the straw man that many social-constructionists and post-modernists knock down. He and they view rational discourse as a monolithic structure, and don't see the internal dialogue and controversy within the critical domain. Still worth reading, but off the mark."
2,Unintelligible,"Performance was not bad, but why in the world go to the trouble of translating the libretto into English? I didn't understand much more than if it had been in Czech with NO subtitles. Putting it in English also distorts Dvorak's musical phrasing. I guess I missed the small print on this one.... if I had known there were no subtitles I would not have purchased it and I'm sure Amazon won't take it back for that reason."
1,Not for LIR fans,"Anyone who knows the real WLIR and wants a compilation disk, this is not for you. When I think LIR, I think early 80s new wave!"
5,a renewed interest for Shoujo Manga.,I got this for Christmas. A good present for a young manga fan or Friend..
5,"Really cute, funny, and romantic!","This story is really cute, funny, and romantic! Miracle Girls is a great thing to read. The story revolves around twins Toni, a tom-boy and older twin, and Mika, resident brain at her school. Mika and Toni go to different schools and, here's the twist that makes the story interesting, have psysic powers. In this book, we meet Toni and Mika and learn about their powers. They switch places so that Mika won't have to participate in Sports Day at her school. Toni falls in love with Mika's arch-rival, Jackson Neil. They are both on the same relay team along with the person that Mika seems to be in love with, Chris. All in all, this is a great story and I definately recommend it to anyone who is into books like Sailor Moon or Cardcaptor Sakura. I left out a lot of things that happened in the book as well, so you'll just have to read to find out!"
1,Mixx/Tokyopop strikes again...,"Don't get me wrong. Miracle Girls is one of my favorite series. It features one of my favorite characters of all time -- Mikage Matsunaga.But blech. Was there a reason for them to go changing the names? (Mika and Toni I could live with -- under huge protest -- but Jackson and Chris?! Umm.. no.) I'm so tired of companies who feel that people in the US can't relate to anyone with names that don't sound like the members of a boyband. I'm a little iffy on the translation too. If at all possible, buy the original japanese version."
3,miracle girls = miracle manga?,"When I first decided to buy this manga, the description on the back seemed somewhat stale. The whole teleportation and telepathy thing between Mika and Toni seemed somewhat old, but I bought it nonetheless.Now don't get me wrong, I do like this manga, but the sister switch has been played on too many times. This isn't your typical shoujo manga but it is very predictable. I hope that Miracle Girls vol.2 is somewhat better than the first."
3,It was good but....,"It was good but I hate how you had to buy the 2nd one to finish the 1st one's ending! I borrowed it from a friend to loves anime and manga and then of course she didn't have the 2nd one! This story has been played a lot like The Parent Trap, and It Takes Two but I did like it after all! I'd recommend this to girls ages 10-14!"
4,"Could be better, but WELL worth it!!!","I thought this DVD was awesome! I own a 98 Impreza myself, and this DVD had a lot of really neat information. It could have had more though, and often shows the same shots over and over again. But some of the in-car footage of rally and track days is awesome! It was well worth the money in my opinion, but only if you truly love the Impreza!"
3,"its more story, than specs of the vehicle","It begins good, but then theres too much talking, it realy haves some good footage, but again i expected to be 3 times better on the tips of these vehicle."
3,WAYNE KRAMER - 'LLMF' (Epitaph),"Title is supposed to stand for 'Live Like A Motherf***er!!'Makes perfect sense.Tunes I thought showed some promise were the opener ""Bad Seed"",the total ass-kicking ""It's Never Enough"",""Down To The Ground"",""Poison"",the MC 5 classic ""Kick Out The Jams"" and ""Count Time"",where Kramer shows off his bluesy side.The former MC 5 guitarist now tours with a trio.Some very basic old school all American rock&roll.Nothing really outstanding here,but pretty decent."
3,Cluster - 'First Encounter Tour 1996' (Cleopatra) 2-CD,"Founding members of the long-running German ensemble Hans Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius had apparently reunited for their first and maybe what'll be their only ever tour of the states in fall, 1996. I've never seen a band / CD that doesn't have titles for their songs, but instead lists their tunes by the track's running time. Very original. I really enjoyed checking out, on disc one cuts no. 3 and 4. On disc two, things do seem to liven up a bit. A total of 2 hours and 15 minutes of revived krautrock, that MOST of the release's material was probably originally done in the '70's. Should appeal to fans of Tangerine Dream, Can, Eno and Neu!"
4,Yes,"Have looked for this book for quite some time. Very happy that I finally located a copy at a ""reasonable"" price. Mind you I had seen this listed for a very high price several times in the past. I think I paid $20 for it.If your a real Yes fanatic like me you'll justify the price."
5,The best Dixie-Gospel -Jazz Album ever!!!!,It just doesn't get any better! Every song will draw you into God's spirit. Fun and uplifting but very worshipful. When I saw that Ave Maria was one of the songs and couldn't imagine how it could be presented by a Jazz Band. But The Jim Cullum Jazz Band pulled it off. I'm positive that even a Conservative Catholic would find it very tasteful and well done.Sure wish we could afford to have the entire band play at a Sunday Worship service at our church in Minnesota.This is one album I am sharing with many of my friends. (Passing it around - not duplicating. Thank you very much).
5,Great!,"This is gospel/religious music that has been given a jazz treatment, but a treatment that is very respectful of the music's religious nature. It is beautiful music, it is extremely well played (and sung), and the recorded sound-quality is about as excellent as you will likely ever hear on CD. The only caveat is that, as a live recording, you occasionally hear audience applause. It's a great disc."
2,"Disorganized, poorly written","The only reason that I gave this two stars instead of one is that it is not full of errors -- i.e. the material presented is accurate.However, just about everything else about the book is terrible. The layout is horrible, the order of presentation was very poorly chosen, and the approach to explaining concepts was unclear ...Try something else -- this is not what you're looking for!"
3,Mimi's christening gown,"I bought this for my 4mth old daughter's christening, it's a beautiful dress but the neck was a bit tight for her (she is a small baby weighing 13lbs) and the zip a bit too stiff to zip up. Other than those 2 faults the look of the dress was fantastic, she looked like a baby angel!"
2,looks nice.,It arrived broken so i wouldnt know if it was functional or not. BUT i did try to attach it either way.. the size was perfect for a compact nissan versa visor and the clips look like the hold pretty good as well... if only they could improve their packaging knowing they are shipping a very breakable mirror.
2,The DVD physical quality poor,"Physical DVD requires dye for storing data. This DVD set have all unreadable DVDs and CDs. Upon inspection of the DVD surface, I realized that the dye was off colored. Returning this set is a hassle."
4,Alot of bang for your buck,"These keeps the boys busy while I take care of things around the house. Would recommend. Some are very basic, but overall good for the price."
2,Not like the original ones,I purchased this for my third granddchild as I had gotten the original ones for my oldest one. These are rather boring compared to the originals.
5,Great Learning DVD's,"We have a few of the LeapFrog Learning DVD's and were thrilled when we received this one as well! It is awesome and my three year old absolutely loves it. His favorite is the Math Circus and then I would have to say the Word Capers. It's such a great way to help them learn their numbers, counting and even sounding out words. It is not only educational but fun as well so it keeps their attention."
4,Really helped!,"My 4 year old's speech, especially her blending sounds have truly improved since she has started watching this movie. I highly recommend this entire series!"
1,Price,"Bought this at $18.49 on 28-Aug-2012 & the selling price today is $14.98, in less than a week!!!What has been done to keep the price competitive??Ridiculous & felt so cheaped!!!"
1,Rather poor,"Out of all four discs, this collection has only one or two moderately interesting songs on it. The rest are poorly mixed with weak themes and bad instrumentation."
4,Excellent research resource,"I have found the book an excellent resource for mixed methods designs, especially to understand more in-depth implications of combining quantitative and qualitative designs. It is an easy to read resource providing correct terminology with explanations, pros and cons of each variation. Thanks!"
3,Beer Drinking Songs Studio players play German music,"Being German American I know most of these tunes and though these tunes are played well there is no soul to this music ! Fast ship, cheap and a great condition but the music is like a bunch of studip muscians randomly contracted and play the music note for note like it's a job. No character or party spirit."
3,What did you expect?,"You know exactly what you are getting when you buy a 2 Live Crew album... This kind of music is why Rockford/Fosgate sold the epicenter. Hilarious (yes, sometimes only if you're a man) lyrics, HUGE amounts of bass, and nothing to think about. Around 1990 or '91, this is the only thing that played over my 4 15's."
4,I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!,This book is set after a huge nuclear war in a school.Three children (Welly Heather and Earl) are outcasts at the school and have trouble making friends.they run away after two mysterious people claming to be Earls lost realatives try to take him.Earl doesn't remember anything about his past before the age of seven.He knows the woman somehow but knows that she isn't his aunte like she says.During the adventure Earl remembaers everything about himself after falling into a hole and hitting his head.

4,An Intersting Perspective,"I'm one of those people who have never been able to grow out of children's books. I found this one in the back of my public library, and it has quickly become one of my favorites. Pamela Service does a wonderful job of tying in the familiar legend of Arthur with a future more real to us in the Nuclear Age. What results is a twist on both worlds not easily forgotten and refreshing to enjoy. Because this book is from the 80's, I would recommend reading this with your child, to explain all the background Pamela Service draws upon. Nuclear war isn't as big an issue as it was then, and Arthur isn't as well read as it was then. Most younger children may find it confusing because they have not grown up with both worlds in the background. In my opinion, this extra time will make this book and its sequel much more enjoyable."
5,Merlin has returned!,A thrilling and suspenseful book that always keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting more. This is a great mystical and magic filled book for young sorcery fans. An intriguing plot of the future makes the book solid and satisfying. A must read book for young merlin fans.
5,Days Long Gone,"Reading Charles Denson's book brought tears to my eyes.I too lived in the Coney Island Houses from the age of 5 until 16. I experienced the dramatic transformation of the neighborhood from an idyllic, peaceful and unique seaside community to a dangerous place, where residents were afraid to venture out because of crime. The book captures,with love and intelligence, the Coney Island I'd like to remember. I am so glad that the author had the insight to document this episode in our lives. Thank you. M from building #4."
1,Not useful,"This book is pretty much useless if you're looking for info on how to build a dulcimer. Only about 60 pages of it actually talks about dulcimer making/repair. The rest is a long winded history/bio of Homer Ledford. Some of that is a bit interesting from an historical/cultural perspective, but the author beats it to death. Homer wanted the book to be just on how to build and care for a dulcimer; the rest was the author's idea. Dean Kimball's book on dulcimer making is better, although still lacking in some areas. This book has no patterns or plans, few useful photos, and is weak in what instruction it does provide. There are a few useful ideas but not worth the price of the book."
3,Not much Information,I was looking to learn from a builders perspective. I did not find much in this book. Lots of praise for the man but very little real information.Other sources are much better.
5,fabulous book in every way,"I bought this book because I was fascinated by the man and his craft. It did not disappoint at all. FAbulous. It is not meant to be a step by step guide to making a ""homer Ledford"" dulcimer ...only he could make one anyway. An 'exact' copy would be silly and would still not achieve an instrument of the quality of a Ledford. (I have one) But it throws light on many many aspects of his craft. The latter bit is the least interesting but is still worth including.Mike From Leeds"
5,A family favorite!,"This is Gerald Durrell at his side-splitting best. Of all his books is our family's favorite. ""The Picnic"" is best read aloud among friends or family...if you can manage to hold yourself together to read amidst the hilarity."
4,not bad for old school industrial!,"I ordered the Industrial Confusion from Amazon.com and i was very impress, I enjoy all the tracks from this cd. Espiecally it's old school! Very good beats, great to work out with and danceable! If you love old school industrial or just industrial all the above, you'll like this one right here!"
1,Holes is not the same as Hungry,I question the quality of this translation. Fait Des Trous is not the same as Hungry. I'll have to check this out and and be more cautious in the furure.
5,apache legacy,THIS WAS THE LAST BOOK IN SERIES OF SIX. I ENJOYED IT FROM COVER TO COVER ITS A GREAT READ YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED. I ONLY WISH THERE WERE MORE BOOKS ON THE COLTON FAMILY IN THE NEAR FUTURE. YOUR FAITHFUL READER OF ALL YOUR BOOKS THANKS AGAIN FOR THE WONDERFUL ADVENTURE. BRENDA FRANCO
3,"Good for the money, but...","The cut and stitching are fine, but the fabric leaves plenty to be desired. It looks good new, but is cheaply woven and degrades quickly. It mats and pills far sooner than it should and a shocking amount of it winds up in the lint trap over the first SEVERAL washings. The price varies A LOT, so wait until it drops (I paid about $16 for the full set.) For that money, with appropriate expectations, it's a good buy. But don't expect luxurious feel and warmth or a long service life."
5,Review of Pinzon Flannel Sheet Set,"The sheet set is a wonderful buy. They are extremely comfortable and cozy, and very inexpensive. The same sheet set in the local stores were twice as expensive."
2,"Cheap price, cheap product","I can't believe this retailer has the nerve to show a ""List Price"" of $80 on these sheets. Just goes to show that ""List Price"", ""Suggested Retail Price"", ""MSRP"", etc, can be anything the seller wants to make it. And words like ""Luxury"", ""Deluxe"", ""Special Edition"", etc, in the product name mean nothing except that the manufacturer's marketing department is doing their job.After washing & drying these once, the fabric is already starting to ball up (pile?) and my dryer filter was stuffed with a half-inch thick layer of fuzz. (Yes, I cleaned out the filter before drying these, so I know that everything in the filter is from this product.) Also, the sheets are incredibly wrinkled coming out of the dryer.Only recommended for cheapskates (like myself) and people who ignore the other negative reviews and still think they can get something nice for next-to-nothing (like myself.)"
2,Not really recommended.,"I was let down by this. The footage, although rare, is constantly repeated. I did not find the commentary overly exciting and the sole commentator is rather montone in his delivery. There is a lot of great information on this DVD but it's not something you want to entertain with. If you are a real hardcore rally racing enthusiast you may enjoy it.If you're looking for exciting footage and rally race commentary you're better off taping the WRC (World Rally Championships) off Speed TV."
3,Get it just for the Pikes Peak Footage,"Most of this DVD is okay, even if there is a disproportionate amount of attention placed on the Fords... But the single best reason to get this is that it contains nearly the entire famous 'Climb Dance' sequence of Ari Vatenen's Peugeot at Pikes Peak. Having that 5 minutes of film on DVD makes the whole disc worthwile."
2,Sutherland was not made for verismo,"Adriana Lecouvreur is usually portrayed by sopranos (many past their prime) who still have some heft to their voices and can produce a dramatic punch. Joan Sutherland unfortunately has neither. Her technique carries her through the music but she barely explores the dramatic possibilities. Her declamation during ""Giusto Cielo"" and her entrance in Act One is embarassingly bad and her death scene is reminiscent of Lucia di Lammermoor. The production is a head-scratcher. Why set the opera in the late nineteenth century when Adrienne Lecouvreur was a historical figure of pre-Revolutionary French theater. The reference to Moliere being in the audience during the first act thus makes no sense nor does the presence of an Abbe. The supporting cast is more than adequate (except for John Shaws woofy Michonnet) though they seem to have to watch Bonynge continually. The sets and costumes are quite opulent"
2,Sad........,"But this role was not for her. The performance is dreadful. Go for Olivero, Dessi or Tebaldi. This DVD is a shame!"
1,Blah!,I can't believe Kultur would have the nerve to release this terrible performance on DVD. They need to call back every copy and burn them. Sutherland is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYY past her prime. She sounds heavy and mannered. High notes are forced and effortful. What more her acting is abominable (as always *sigh*). This performance is not something I would watch to remember Sutherland's talent by.
2,Low Key,"I can't praise this album for the reason I didn't like it very much. I like some bits of melodies and lyrics here and there but that's about it. It seems to me that production was done without much care in a sense that low key and no-production is made up to a style on this album. Some people may like it, but I did not."
2,"The ""Chore"" part I get...","...but where's the ""Enchantment""?? Poorly warmed-over Tom Waits, like week-old coffee reboiled over an open fire, hardly qualifies as ""fascinating,"" ""haunting"" or ""genius"" in my book. Given the overheated reviews found here on Amazon I expected much, much more; but, although innocuous enough, the songs on this CD are neither particularly original nor at all memorable, and after 10 listless listens-through, it's clear that it's not going to be a keeper. Indeed, compared to Waits or Young, Gelb's lyrics are incredibly trite and his music is forced, clunky, and evocative of nothing in particular--the album's a real yawner. Perhaps it's one thing for long-time followers of Giant Sand, but if you're new to Gelb's sensibility, as I was, I'd recommend thinking twice before purchasing this album. I was looking for an oasis in the desert of the increasingly lifeless ""alternative"" music scene, but found instead...well, just a whole lot more sand."
1,from Russia with lots of advertising,"I guess I was expecting more photos, more instruction and more workouts. I wasn't expecting ads and testimonials on how great the method is. I returned this book."
3,"too much ,too much","The content on the excersises is good, although there should be more shown. my biggest problem with this book are the pages and pages of what i call advertisement for the kettlebells. i can see one or two comments from people who have used and reccomend the kettlebells, but there are so many that it is distracting and annoying!! I might be less tempted to purchase another of his books if this is the format for all his books."
1,You should read the book first in the library before you buy,"If you have no experience with UNIX, maybe you will find something interesting in this book. The intention is right, ""this is NT way... and this is Solaris way"", but, the entire organization is awful, one example: you are reading and then find something like ""go to page 123..."" and you are in page 123! You better review it before you buy."
5,A Well-Balanced Treatment,"The difficulty of dealing with vampires in fiction is caused by the problem of balancing their near-supernatural powers with the limited ability of humans to deal with them. Saberhagen short-circuits this by changing sides! His favorite vampire uses his abilities to help humans, frequently at his own peril. This book illustrates this without pushing it to extremes, and he allows the poor humans to intervene decisively at critical points. A very good read or re-read!"
3,Not bad,"I didn't know this was book 3 in a series until after I was done. That being said, I was able to follow the story with no problem and did not feel lacking in background. I prefer Saberhagen's Lost Sword work but this isn't bad."
2,A Fiend in the Family,"I didn't particularly like The Dracula Tapes, but I thought that might have been because it seemed forced; Saberhagen was obliged to stick with the ""facts"" as written by Bram Stoker, which produced some very silly and unintentionally comical results.I was sufficiently entertained so as to be drawn to a second novel, hoping that the author might do better when not fettered by the chains of existing narrative. I selected ""An Old Friend of the Family"" because it is an early book and might still retain something fresh.I was dead wrong. Writing in 81, Saberhagen makes attempts to modernize his tale of Dracula coming to rescue Mina Harker's descendants but those efforts now seem dated and comical. The entire setup, about Morgan Le Fay and her minions, seems forced. And kidnaping Dracula by whacking him on the head with a wooden stake just seems ridiculous.This book is the one that pretty much convinced me not to bother with the rest of the series."
4,excellent chill down,"great chill down, massage, meditation, contemplation music. i work in the healing arts and have heard much in this genre of music and this i rank among the top"
4,for the low 700's,"This book is not so indepth like the Barrons where you are swamped with useless grammer. If you have an ok grasp of English and wish to go for a low 700, then this book is perfect. I read through it and recieved a 710."
1,Poor quality,"I tried using this product but to my dissapointment the sockets did not retain its shape they rounded quite easily and wear down it is like these sockets is made from a low grade material, its to soft for impact work. I will not recommend this product to anyone it's a waste of money"
3,Standard romance-but still fun,"I kept thinking ""Love Story"" and ""A Walk to Remember"" with a twist. Somehow a fabulous looking woman who is dying manages to help a troubled man, who is her polar opposite, find himself before she passes over. This film is no different. The acting is passable at best and the screenplay is thin. With all that said, I must say that I still like it. I guess I'm a sucker for a sappy love story. As far as the interracial part goes, it is something that is not even mentioned in the film between the characters. That was refreshing. Watch it if you like sappy chick flicks."
4,Bad acting if you ask me,"The love story is enduring, but the acting could have been a ton better. I love this movie because it is one of the first movies me and my husband watched together, but it does leave a lot to be desired."
5,Love Story.....,"This movie reminded me of the old movie Love Story. Love the actors, the falling in love and the surrounding scenery, I've must have watch it five or six times since I bought it.&#8203;"
2,Rated C+,"This movies story had great meaning and possiblity. The actors chemistry was a little shakey in the beginning but I guess that was the point so, in that case it might have been a good thing. As the movie progressed the story came alive, i loved the intention of the story plot very much much but it got lost in translation during the party of the same sex married men, it got awkward but maybe that was intentional too. In the end the beauty of the stories direction felt bland with a promise of more but never quite connecting to it. It was a very cute story."
1,How can it be reviewed without a list of contents,Imposible to want to buy or review without a list of the songs and artists it contains.
5,excellent truck!!,"we got a bunch of these little plan toy wooden cars for Christmas & our little boys LOVE them. they are cute, wooden, different from every other cheap toy you find at the store... NOT made in china, not made of plastic, etc.Yes, they are pricey for a hand-held truck, but the quality is excellent!!we will continue to buy plan toys. LOVE them!!"
5,Ground breaking in content!,"I was amazed at the content of this book. Not only did it provide details of the ET experience from an experiencer point of view, it sought to deal with the issues faced by individuals involved in a phenomenon about which there is little or no publicized objective data.I would heartily recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand the nature of the abduction experience.For those looking for practical solutions that will help them synthesize the nature of this labrinthine topic, it is an outstanding tool for their library."
4,An intriguing angle on another difficult subject,"I liked the question this book tackled. What we think and feel about religious beliefs as a society and how such ideas can grow out of social and scientific events that have nothing to do -- originally -- with religion.It's a passionate subject, which Matthews presents from a dispassionate side. It's an unfamiliar fit but I wonder if it isn't deliberately done? The Andrej books compelled people to identify with a passionate character no matter how much they fought against it. I learned that I could like a man I despised. And the shared passion was enjoyable. Here, where I would feel comfortable with passion (even assume it these days), Matthews doesn't employ it, forcing me to look at the subject matter more objectively.I agree that the story could have been longer. But, I think it's a good read. I'll be interested in seeing what tack Matthews takes in the next book (and I look forward to another Kosciusko book)."
1,Major Disappointment,"After her previous books I bought this one without a second thought. But the story dragged (and it isn't that long a story) with boring people doing boring things for no apparent reason. Eghak.I will, of course, buy her next novel without question, hoping for a return to form."
3,The Need For Accountability,"Lori is an interesting and funny speaker and she brings much of that ""spark"" into this book. She writes a practical book and both the need for accountability in ministry as well as helping to show how to set up circles of accountability. She uses her own real life examples to demonstrate what she is teaching. A good book both for those new to the ministry as well as the veterans."
3,"Not bad, but not great.","The 'Authentic recipes from ...' series of cookery books is generally pretty good. This one, though still pretty decent, is not one of the best. The photography is excellent and the introductory material at the beginning of the text is very good but, despite this, I don't think I would recommend the book to beginners. The range of recipes is limited and some of the dishes featured, Bulgogi, for instance, are quite different from other more mainstream interpretations (although this does not make them any less 'authentic', as some would argue). I was also surprised to see that there is very little mention of the typical side-dishes that accompany Korean meals. This, to my mind, rather misses the central character of Korean cuisine and I think that, consequently, those looking for a good overview of Korean food won't find it here."
4,"Essentially the same as ""the food of korea""","If you like periplus cookbooks and already own ""the food of"" version of this book, then reconsider buying this one. The new ""authentic recipes from"" series is just a rehash of the ""food of series"" with a few subtle changes such as relacing obscure recipes with more recognisable ones, bigger font and format, less on the history and some updated pictures.Overall I kind of like the recipes in the new books more as there is less filler and odd recipes, but I do like the layout and format of the older hardcover ""food of"" books. So if you own ""the food of"" and want to get this book, be prepared to sell it off as you will only end up doubling up 90% of recipes between the 2."
3,Authentic recipes from Korea,I liked this book and the pictures are great...I would have liked to see more recipes.
4,Reprint of Food of Korea,"To me this looks like a reprint of ""Reprint of Food of Korea"" which is a good book. That said it leans toward ""Royal Cuisine"". That said if you do not have Food of Korea this book as a better font (eaiser to read)."
4,what is going to happen,Spells out what and why of the real reason the Ara countries are as they are. I understood a great many reasons.
2,From prejudice on prejudice,This book is written from the point of view of a fundamentalist Christian who believes that Abraham's eldest son Ishmael was jealous of his younger brother Isaac. This is seen as sinful because it was God's will that Isaac should be the heir. So to this day the descendants of Ishmael hate the descendants of Isaac. Really there is nothing new in this book. And it says the bombing of London in World War Two was Britain's punishment for betraying the Jews. This is a little illogical because the Jewish people suffered more than any other nation in that war. Not a nice book.
2,Too many opinions - too little facts,"I guess I should have done some research on this Hal Lindsey character before I bought a book by him. Or maybe just realized what ""father of the modern day prophecy movement"" that it claims on the back cover actually means.I give it 2 stars because at the beginning he actually tries to explain some theological history between the Christians, Jews, and Arabs. But after that he launches into an attack on all muslims, and even President Obama, who he claims is a Muslim and is single-handedly leading the world to the Apocalypse. Not just the US, the whole world. Yeah.Quite frankly, the book is terrible and I didn't learn anything. Just ended up reading about how this lunatic thinks the bible prophecies will all come true in his lifetime and how it's all Obama's fault.I wouldn't waste your money on this 200 paged opinion."
4,"Western pride, simply packaged","THis book might be better as an example of what the west is capable of rather than as a historical book. It is in affect a book that is full of pride and distate for the other. THere is no accepting of the other, no idea that his values or his ideas must be understood, no excusing him, no moral relativism saying that 'well it is his culture so its is ok'. Yes this book is sort of like what is read in every classroom in the Muslim world, except reversed, it is a book that likes the west, likes not having to pray five times a day, likes not having to have a women's testimony be worth half a mans, and a likes to adit that, ys the Bible does guide some people.So it may seem simplistic and 'racist' and 'evil' but that is merely the judging voices of those who appreciate it when other cultures have pride but hate to have any pride or anger in defense of their own.Seth J. Frantzman"
3,The truth of the matter is:,"This is a dangerous book were Lindsey tries through a one sided view to spur hatered bewtween religions rather than emcourage inter-faith dialoques. He presents gross mirepresntations of history, religions (both christian and islamic), and world affairs.Mr. Lindsey's book lacks historical and scientific evidence. His only account of history of the middle east is through a skewed interprestation of the holy scriptures.Everyone with common sense and logic will question the very foundation of his argument.I encourage the author and reader to study history from its real sources and leave up to them to draw their own conclusions.This is a book about a fundamentalist who is not different than bin Laden. The main goal of this piece of work is to misguide the american public and encourage extremism, hatred, and intolerance."
1,everlasting hatred,"After reading this book, the only ""everlasting hatred"" that I can see is Hal Lindsey's hatred for his fellow human beings, the Muslims. This is second rate propaganda, but I'm sure it will fire up people who need something to hate to validate their faith. Whenever I read garbage like this, I remember what Jesus said: ""love your neighbor as you love yourself."" If only Hal and other hate mongers would follow what Jesus really taught."
1,A pack of spiteful lies,"Hal Lindsey has produced a beautiful piece of hatred that would put the ""Sacred Protocol of the Elders of Zion"" to shame. He distorts history, fabricates, omits, or slants facts to suit a very narrow agenda driven entirely upon hatred of Muslims and Arabs. Interestingly, he doesnt seem to care at all for Arab Christians -- they must be the children of a lesser god.If you ever wonder ""Why Do they hate us"", look no further than Mr. Lindsey and his ilk. I am dissappointed that this book is required reading for so many churches around here."
1,"A ridiculous, hateful and missinformed piece of garbage.",Anyone who is not a complete idiot or blinded by their own religious allegiances knows that the reasons Arabs despise the United States are our ridiculous foreign policies and unabashed imperialism.To suggest that Islam is concerned with the destruction of Christianity and Judaism is complete nonsese. One quick look at the historical record should prove to even the most ardent Lindsey supporter that he is utterly wrong.
3,a bit disappointed,"I love Hal Lindsey but this book was a bit too technical for me. i wish i could say something more positive, as I enjoy his weekly television and internet programs, but I passed this on to the used book store as well."
5,ENLIGHTENMENT,READ THE TRUTH AND OPEN YOUR EYES TO WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE AND AROUND THE PLANET AS THE AGE OF GRACE IS QUICKLY DRAWING TO A VIOLENT CLOSE!
5,The Everlasting Hatred: The Roots of Jihad,"I always expect the very best from Hal Lindsay and wasn't at all disappointed upon reading this amazing, knowlegable book! This well-written, insightful book is filled with easy to grasp facts and wisdom regarding the complexity of the subject, and has opened my eyes of understanding concerning the history behind what is happening in our time. This is an important book for anyone who wants a clear, Biblically prophetic understanding about what is going on in this world."
5,Best book for the times we live!,"This read about the beginning of the Jihad from their roots in the times of Abraham Issac and Jacob. The hatred of the people from the linage of Ishmael. The proof is from the historical data that was laboriously studied by Hal Lindsay. What a treat of a read. You will enjoy this book if you are Christian and you will learn the truth if you are Muslim. Just give the book a chance to open your eyes. The Holy Bible would be a better choice, but this is great."
3,History of Hate,"This book provides a very good background for the Islamic Fundamentalist problems of today. Mr. Lindsey has obviously researched this subject well. Unfortunately, there do not seem to be solutions short of all out warfare. It is only a matter of time."
1,Most Hate-Filled Book I've Ever Read,"I read the book to see how far Lindsey could go,and it's way too far.This book is nothing but hate filled lies to flame upthe hate against Islam by evangelical neocons who want to maketheir form of Christianty the main religion in the world.I'm terrified by how many people but into Lindsey's mindset.It's atragic time we live in when all that matters is using religionfor power and economic controll.He refuses to see the mistakesthe United States has made to support Israel at all costs,especially our security.He has absolutely no understanding of cause and effect,of how we are in the mess wein now.Muslims aren't the ones destroying Christianty,it'speople like Lindsey who make followers into rabid Islamhating war mongers."
2,Inaccurate thermometer readings,"Weems & Plath products are great looking and well made, but I cannot recommend this particular one. It measures both temperature and humidity, which is great, but when I compared the temperature readings from this Comfortmeter to the readings I obtained from several other thermometers I know to be accurate - others which were, accordingly, in agreement - I found the Comfortmeter to read consistently about 3 degrees Farenheit below these other thermometers. I did not have accurate humidity monitors in my home at the time, or I would have done that comparison as well. No matter: you are paying for the Comfortmeter because you want both the temperature and humidity measurements to be accurate and it is enough to know that one of these is way off."
5,"Very informative, well written book","I walked away from reading this feeling fully empowered to move forward with an adoption as a single; it also opened my eyes to many aspects of single parenting (especially an adopted child) that I had never considered. I have passed this book on to friends who are also in the process or thinking about it. Highly recommend reading this even if you are already adopting-There are also exercises at the end of each section/chapter that force you to think about what you are doing by journaling, very effective."
3,Not for singles who already know they want to adopt,"I know many singles who have considered adoption who found this book to be very helpful, so I was eager to read it myself as I began the adoption process as a single. Although I can see how this book would be helpful to many, it was not the book for me. Most of the book is devoted to helping the reader make the decision of whether or not they want to be a single parent at all, and then deciding if adoption is the right path for them. I had already made both of these decisions, so the book was not at all helpful to me. There is almost no information about *how* to adopt as a single. I wouldn't object to this so much if the book didn't claim to be a ""complete"" guide. A better title would be ""Adopting on Your Own: Making the Decision to Adopt as a Single"". I would not recommend this book to anyone who has already decided to pursue adoption as a single parent, but I can see how it would be helpful to those still making this decision."
3,Does what it says it will.,Not much to really say about this. It allows 4 HDMI connections to 1 output and it works well. I would have given it 5 stars but my issue is that it's always on. There's no power switch. IN this day in age shouldn't we be turning things off when not in use? This just stays on 24 hours a day burning up electricity. Not cool.
4,Great for switching from one electronic device to another,Love this for being able to connect all of my electronic items to a tv that does not have enough HDMI inputs. The only downside is the blue light is blinding. We had to hide the blue light or we couldn't even watch TV because it was so bright.
2,Extremely bright blue LEDs make it difficult to watch the screen,"Like many devices these days, the box designer decided to put blue LEDs that are so bright that they interfere with watching the TV screen. I had to cover the bulbs with electrical tape to block the light. Other than that, it does it's job, but I agree with another reviewer that it needs a power switch."
4,A DECIDEDLY FLORAL FRAGRANCE,"For those who like a decidedly floral fragrance ""Sirene"" might be your choice. It's a blend of jasmine, orangeflower, geranium, and violet.While the product page suggests daytime wear, I found it a bit heady and prefer it for evening.The packaging is lovely, contemporary yet timeless with an image of the Roman goddess of love modeled after the Venus statue on display at the Conservatory in Rome."
3,Pretty,But that's it. Not as original as Vicky's other perfumes. I don't think I'll be buying this one again.
3,"Cool, soothing melodies ... but ...","All the songs in this CD are great, however, they were played a bit too mellow for my taste. The percussions need to pound stronger, the base needs to be reverberate more deeply. There is passion hidden in this performer's guitar which must be released with the appropriate sound engineering. I listen to this CD frequently and hear glimpses of genius ... I wanted to feel the rhythm more, but end up just bobbing my head gently with the beat. Oh well, I guess it's back to the Gipsy Kings and Jesse Cook ..."
1,Flamenco gone cheesey,"I guess their is a big ""new age"" market out there which goes for the plastic confection on offer here. Quality guitar playing yes, but all too-easy on the ear, four-square rhythm, anodyne synth decoration. Ultimately souless. Flamenco has a totured soul - duende - a firey passion. This is wet cardboard in comparisson. Flamenco, proper flamenco, is a taste that has to be acquired, a musical language that has to be learnt. This is flamenco-lite for people who simply cannot be bothered."
1,This videotape is a complete waste of money.,Diana: Her Life 1961-1997 is a videotape consisting mostly of interviews with journalists and very tackily done scenes of actors re-enacting supposed behind the scenes happenings between Charles and Diana. There is very little video footage of Diana herself and what you see of her are mostly still photographs. I found it to be a very disappointing and tacky tape compared with many of the others availble which are very tastefully done. It's certainly not worth the money. END
1,This is not the Battery for SDR-H40,"I really, really disapointted with amazon, because this is not the battery for SDR-H40 camcorder... I dont know how to fix the problem because I send the camcorder and the battery as a gift to a friend in Central America... This shipment cost the price of the battery, what a shame..."
1,Not the right part.....OOps,"This battery did not fit the camcorder that I purchased..according to the Lenmar website, the part should have been an LIP14, not an 07. I am returning it to Amazon..."
1,this does not match for sdr h40,"I had purchased the battery in the month of august and today i opened it and found this does not suit for PANASONIC SDR H40, how can amazon do this. What should i do now. Let me know, what way i can return the Battery and get a suitable battery. I am regular customer."
2,wrong one,was stated this covered my movie camera.it didnt so still in package sitting in a drawer.oh well my mistake
4,Good Industrial recording,"This is a pretty good quality industrial recording. It has some good guitar samples, but there are a few parts where it seems there could have been a bit more complexity in the sound. In all however, this is still worth the money."
5,"Fast, not noisy. Great disposal.","This is a great unit. It's not noisy, it works well, it was easy to install... I am very happy with it. Enough said."
4,Happy with it,"Working great so far, not loud can't review it more then what it is, will update more down the line."
4,Delivered what was promised,"The other reviews adequately prepared me for the product I purchased. The installation was a breeze, the performance was exceptional and as noted in the other reviews, it was a bit noisier than the unit it replaced. However, I was willing to accept a unit that was a little noisier as a trade off for performance, warranty and ease of installation."
4,Waste King L-8000 1hp Waste Disposal,"Good quality. Installed rather well except seal (rubber gasket) under flange leaked. Several re-installs didn't help. Eventually omitted seal and replaced with caulk. Suppose that will not last forever, but works great for now. My guess is the seal is too thin to overcome minor undulations in s.steel sink outlet.Upon reflection, I would purchase a 3/4hp or even 1/2hp. One hp is over-kill for our use."
4,So far so good,"I bought this disposal 2 months ago when my old one died. It was extremely easy to put in, and it took around 30 minutes or so. It may be one of the more expensive disposals, but it certainly does the job. I've seen some complaints about noise, but I don't really have any. It's not whisper quiet, but I don't run it for extended periods of time either so it doesn't seem that bad to me. Also, power was more important than noise to me, but everyone's needs are different. This disposal certainly delivers on power."
4,One monster disposal,"This is the third disposal we've had to install in ten years. So we must be kinda hard on disposals. I really liked how easy this one was to install, it came with semi-clear instructions but included pictures so we figured it out. My husband is NOT very handy around the house but had this installed in less than 30 minutes. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it is really large. We had to manuver pipes around to attach it because the last two disposals were quite a bit smaller. If you're installing into a limited space beware. But once in place, it runs fairly quiet, and really does a quick and efficient job. I even put carrot scrapings in which clogged our old disposal but this one took care of them with ease. I would recommend to a friend."
5,One fault but still 5 stars,"Overall excellent experience. Shipped right away, delivered right away and the best part - installtion instructions were well written and made sense. These days with so many things being made ""offshore"" I like not having to puzzle things out.The only fault I can find, and it might be my fault, the power cord that is included is very difficult to remove. I was replacing a hard-wired unit and couldn't use the attached cord. There might be another Waste King 8000 that comes without a cord and that is what I would have ordered. Especially if I had known it would take as long to cut the supplied cord from the unit as it did to install it.Anyway, easy, straight forward replacement, quiet operation, seems to do what it's supposed to."
5,Money not wasted on waste king,"Great product, no complaints. Easy to install for DIYers, came with cord to plug in, drain ring and adapter. Requires basic plumbing skills, wrench and screwdriver. Replaced 15 year old insinkerator. Much quieter, no vibration. Eats anything my family gives it. Very happy with purchase and price which was the cheapest I have seen after shopping around. Came to the house via UPS in just a few days. Rated as top pic by consumer reports."
5,good choice,"Best disposer I've ever owned! Nothing stops it. My husband installed it and it was a snap. The first one we received was damaged, but Amazon replaced it right away."
4,"very powerful, easy to install","Make sure your piping is able to handle the pressure output this unit can put on a drain! In a condo situation, my unit was able to power waste out faster than the ""swallow rate"" of pipes below.... otherwise know as a plug. Had the pipes cleared and checked - it really is just an overall drain problem at my location.Works great as long as everyone remembers to feed it slowly & with a lot of water.This should not be a problem in most locations."
4,No problems,"Transaction went well and quickly, no problems at all. Product description is as stated. Right now it is much quieter than their 3/4 HP version. So far, don't have any complaints."
3,Efficient but NOT QUIET,"I am so diappointed with the noise level of the Waste King L-8000 Legend disposal. This disposal replaced an old Badger that was leaking, noisy and constantly jamming with the least bit of food. Well, the Waste King L-8000 does a great job of grinding bones, etc. However, it is noisier than my old Badger. When the disposal is first turned on, it initially makes a terrible metal clicking sound. I called Waste King, and was told, ""Oh! That's normal, but you don't hear it that much when it's grinding up food"" and ""that's the way it operates."" So if noise bothers you, go with the Insinkerator Evolution Compact.If I had to chose again, I would spend the extra money and chose the Badger Evolution Compact."
2,Very difficult to install,Extremely difficult to install. Could not get it to lock onto sink. Really takes two people to do this. Gave up after two hoursReturned to Amazon.
3,"Had trouble with cushion mount, but then went smoothly.","I have put this off as a bad purchase and it was just sitting in my closet for months due to the original box being destroyed and thrown away and hence not being able to return.First, I received this through ""Waste King Direct"", which I""m learning is an incompetent and shady company. That explains why I didn't receive any literature/manuals for this product. Second, I'm having a heck of a time trying to install the ""cushion mount"" rubber seal onto the flange in order to mount the garbage disposal. The ""cushion mount"" seems to be too big and it won't all for the disposal to mount. Not enough clearance for the ""tab"" to be inserted and turned into the groove to be properly secured. But, problem solved, and edited.Over a very decent disposal, except for the flimsy - cheap - plastic enclosure...."
2,noisy/hard to install!,Had a professional plumber install this piece of XXXX and he fought it for an hour. His opinion reflects my own...noisy. The 3 bolt clamp was not provided and the plastic insert should have been metal. Warranty of ten years? Haw!
5,Waste king works great,Received product in a timely manner. Disposer works great and the price was very competitive. Thanks.
5,Works great,"This unit replaced an Insinkerator 777SS model that was about 7 years old. The old model would not shred the food fine enough so the sink drain would always get plugged. I kept a plunger under the sink just for that reason.The Waste King does not do that. I have run various foods, especially onion peels, without the sink plugging. You can tell by the sound that this operates at a higher RPM that my old unit. Other people have complained about it being noiser than an Insinkerator, which it is, but not objectionally. It is actually noiser if the water goes directly in the center of the drain, probably due to the higher speed. Move the water out of the center and the unit is only slightly louder than the Insinkerator. I can put up with a little louder noise rather than the sink plugging all the time."
5,Excellent replacement,"Quick summary:1. I replaced a InSinkErator Badger 5 with this unit.2. I did replace the 3 bolt InSinkErator sink flange with the EZ-Mount flange that came with the unit. If you keep the original 3 bolt InSinkErator sink flange, you must purchase theWaste King 3101 ISE Adapter Kit(sold separately). The only difference with the Waste King EZ mount and the 3 bolt sink flange is that you can remove the splash guard from the EZ-Mount.3. I did not have to modify the drain pipes (see uploaded pics). Your results may vary.The unit works as advertised. Installation was easy. I've replaced many disposals (former landlord), thus this unit only took me about an hour to install.Cons:1. The loud pop when you turn on the disposal. However, there is no ""pop"" if the unit has water inside the disposal. The unit is considerably quieter than the old Badger 5.2. Sink flange is chromed ABS plastic - not stainless steel. ALthough I installed the ABS version, I may replace it at a later date."
4,"Wow, really quiet!","My brother hooked this up for me to replace a very old Kenmore. He had no problems with hookup. Wow, I was shocked at how quiet this disposal is! I can barely hear it as opposed to my old Kenmore which was extremely loud. The only thing I noticed is that the water drains slower so I don't know if that's the way this disposal is, or if it's the way my bro hooked it up. So far I really like it!"
1,MOUNTING SYSTEM SUCKS!!!!!,"This Disposal has without a doubt the worst designed mounting system that could ever be.I have spent hours under the sink trying to lock this piece of crap in place!When I bought this I was looking for a disposal for 3 properties that I have and planned onbuying 3 of them if I liked it.I wouldn't take the other two if they gave me them for free!I may be sending this back! WHAT A POOR DESIGN!MY SUGGESTION, BUY SOMETHING ELSE!"
1,Died after 15 months,"The motor died after 15 months...I had bought a similar unit from Costco last year.Really messy.Irritating, loud clicking noise when the motor starts.The thin metal ring on the top came off, because coffee grounds loged underneath after some time.The unit is too heavy for the mechanism to screw it on.The engine was too strong for the flimsy holders...but only until it died.I went with a Sears Incinerator OEM with 5 years warranty in-home exchange instead.Less power but much stronger built.Don't waste your time with waste king products."
3,Made in China,"I did some research on the Insinkerator Evolution and Waste King. I bought the Insinkerator because it is made in Wisconsin and the Waste King is made in China. The Insinkerator is of excellent quality. I know it costs more than the Waste King but that is because Insinkerator pays better wages and benefits and this compensation goes to our friends, family and neighbors here in the US.It is difficult sometimes to find products made in the USA but I believe that when we can, we should help our economy by purchasing these products. Products made in the USA are often better quality than those make elsewhere."
1,made in China junk,"described to be a heavy duty die hard waste disposer. instead, it is a lightweight, noisy, cheaply constructed, overpriced piece of junk. its going back."
2,Jury is still out.,"I just installed this unit. Installation wasn't as easy as others have claimed, but it was about average for replacing an old build in appliance. So far I am very disappointed in the noise (high) and drainage (slow). I will give it a little time and determine if there is a manufacturing defect or perhaps an installation problem. If I can rule out an installation problem and it continues to perform like this I will be testing the ""Lifetime in-house warranty"" and will update this review.A day later: Just talked to customer service about the noise. The representative listened to the noise over the phone and said that it was normal. I guess I'll live with it for awhile longer, but I still don't like the noise of this one. I have an InSinkerator at my lake cabin and it is remarkably quiet, quick and powerful. I don't really care about horsepower and RPM as long as it is quiet, quick and powerful."
4,"Powerful grinder, excellent operation, difficult mounting.","Pro: Excellent grinder operation. Grinds everything very small so I hope I will not have the clogged drains I have had with a previous weaker grinder.It is as quiet as a 1 HP grinder could be, I suppose.Cons: Even with the EZ mount collar, it is very hard for a single person to mount it. The noise insulating cover comes so high it can obstruct the collar dropping low enough to lock the ring without two people to help lift and center the heavy motor. The old 3-bolt system would have been easier.The noise is not insignificant, but it may appeal to Harley owners as it has a low loud growl."
1,"Noisy as heck, sounds like total junk","We had this installed when we put on new countertops. Selected this model as it seemed to be excellant rated with 1.0 HP motor. Problem #1, when you first hit the switch to start it, it sounds like a big motor throwing out a little blade. Sounds like it's going to break. Problem #2, running noise, it isn't just a little loud, it is horriable and sounds like it is going to tear itself apart. Replaced a 20 year old 3/4 HP insinkerator model. I wished I would have kept it, this one would come out and I'd put the old one back in. Plus it is huge in size and takes a lot of room under the sink. Don't believe the statements that it's ""a little louder"". Sounds like you have a Harley Davidson under you sink, DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL."
5,Works great about 10 minute install.,A little bigger than my old disposal so it takes more room but it arrived quickly and installed nicely and has been running great.
5,Great Power,"This thing works like a champ no matter what I have put in it. Its quiet as well. Fairly easy to install. Like mentioned in other ads the Sink ring is not the highest quality, but it looks fine and seems to work as intended."
5,Grinder,"Strong disposal. Not a slide in replacement for an ISE unit, but worth the small modification to under-sink plumbing. Could use a spray of foam insulation to make more quiet. But nice unit for price."
5,Waste King L-8000 Legend Garbage Disposal,"Adding to the many glowing reviews, this garbage disposal is top-notch. I cannot believe how quiet and powerful this unit is. The build quality is very good and installation was a snap (as long as you have some basic pluming knowledge and tools).Highly recommended!"
4,No problems so far,"The device can produce a short period of noise, but it does a good job at its function. The installation instructions could have been of better quality."
4,Excellent customer service,"I bought this unit in October and had it installed in December. After two months, the unit began to leak. I discovered this only when I went down to my cellar and saw water pouring down from above. I called a plumber for an emergency repair and contacted Anaheim Manufacturing (maker of the disposal).Although the parts (drain connection, flange) were not actually part of the unit and therefore were not covered by the warranty, they offered a good faith reimbursement which I consider generous. I recommend them highly for their customer service."
5,Waste King 8000,The garbage disposal was a very good product for the price and very easy to install. Great product.
2,Frustrating,"I bought this product because it looked like it would be easy to install and would work well being a 1 hp and it had a lifetime warranty. I have tried to install this product and haven't finished yet as it is leaking. This sink flange is tight and water is not leaking from there. The rubber gasket is on the discharge tube and it is as tight as I can make it. I put paper towels around both the flange and the discharge tube and it doesn't seem to be leaking from from either of these parts. It leaks when a lot of water is released and it drains a lot at once. I have tried everything to fix it and probably spent over 20 hours. I have an authorized plumber from the company who will come over, but he needs to get a new disposer sent and it will be another week. I thought this was going to take 2 hours max, but it was more of a month long project for me. I suspect I was sold a defective unit which caused me to waste a lot of my time."
2,Light weight cheap product,The whole assembly is very light weight with a plastic collar that mounts to the sink flange. My unit arrived broken with one of the plastic tabs cracked off. I returned it and bought a Badger unit with a steel collar and sink flange.
5,So far so great!,"Not only was the product delivered in a very short time, not only is this product a work horse, but also, the manufacturer's customer service is great.I've had the product for about 6 months now and the other day I found a puddle under my sink directly under the disposer. I contacted customer service and was quickly put through to a technician who walked me through finding out what the problem was. It turned out my plumber had made a slight error in installation. With the help of the knowledgeable, patient technician, I was able to fix the problem myself and everything is working perfectly now."
4,Easy to install and working great,"I looked seriously at the Kitchen Aid and In-Sink Erator brand waste disposers before buying the Waste King. The strange thing is that Waste King doesn't get the exposure of the other brands but has the superior specs (lifetime warranty, faster RPMs) and a lower price. I did the install myself in under 3hrs and a good portion of that included getting stumped during the removal my old In-Sink Erator Badger (1/2 HP). I recommend the easy install model for Waste King since the turn & lock mechanism really does makes it easy to snap on. The instructions were clear and simple. No screw turning required. The 1 HP L-8000 model should also do an excellent job grinding waste into small bits and reducing (maybe eliminate?) the need to have a plumber clear out our pipes once a year - the reason I decided to buy a new unit."
5,Excellent garbage disposal,"We are very pleased with the manner in which this garbage disposal functions. The only drawback is that it takes up more room under the sink than most disposals. However, the quality is worth it."
4,Good garbage disposal at a good price,I checked Consumer Reports for garbage disposals. The Waste King L-8000 was rated highly and Amazon had it at price much lower than anything else in its class available at the local stores. We've had it for a year now: it works well and has given us zero trouble.
5,Top of the line,"This disposer arrived within a few days. A plumber installed it for $100 and it worked like a champ. Based on previous disposers I've had, this was clearly the ""waste king"". Quiet, strong and fast, I'm guessing it would take an expensive commercial grade disposer to do any better. When I need another one, I'm going this route."
5,A really nice disposer!,"I have this disposer for about 6 months. Really, it is a very nice disposer. It runs strong, quietly and smoothly. Just as all the great reviews I had read before I chose to buy this disposer, I am very happy on this purchase."
5,Waste King L-8000,Waste King L-8000Owned 2 monthsI purchased this disposal to replace a worthless Insinkerator Badger disposal(housing cracked just like everyone else) and have been very happy with its performance and ease of installation. It only required a few plumbing modifications but needed no additional parts. It runs very quiet and has three times the power of the old unit. The only thing I missed when ordering is that the unit I received has a chromed drain ring and I have a stainless sink. Looks a little funny compared to the other drain but works. The price I payed was much better than what I would have payed for an inferior disposal from insinkerator.
5,Waste King Disposer-heavy duty,Monster disposal. Heavy duty-industrial-I won't ever have to replace this. For the price it is a great bargain.Highly recommend this.
5,Fantastic Amazon sale price!!!,"This is an American Company right here in Anaheim, Ca! This is an American made product! But better yet it has a lifetime warranty for in home exchange! Not to mention it is the quietest GD that I have ever owned."
5,quiet and powerful,Instillation was unique so must read the directions carefully. I've installed disposers before and this one is different and feels like you are missing steps or parts!
5,Great product,Quiet and powerful. Exceeds what I had expected. Still running extremely well after my purchase a long while back. Highly recommend.
1,loud as metal grinding metal,"Bought this item based on the review here. But the when it starts, it sounds like metal hitting/grinding metal, raelly really loud. This only happens when it starts when the motor is still, when I turn the machine back on when the motor is still spinning, there is no sound.Is it normal?"
2,Waste King L-8000,The Disposal leaked and had to be returned. A professional plumber did the install and still had trouble with it.
5,3 and Counting.....,"Just recently completed my 3rd install; my house, my parents & most recently in my Deli. If you're even a average DIY person, you shouldn't have any problems. Read the directions and you'll be fine. To the ""professional plumbers"" who've had trouble installing this unit, I'm hiring at the Deli, no wait, making sandwiches at my Deli is harder than installing this disposal."
4,Installation,"After reading some negative reviews on installation and noise, I wondered about the Consumer Report rating and self-installation. I read and re-read installation instructions, took it apart and put it together a couple of times as a dry run. When I finally attempted it, it came together very easily/no problems. Noise seemed minimal to me; but then this is first disposal for me and it is mounted to heavy porcelain sink. Only rated it a 4 star because I need to run it a year or 2 trouble free before it warrants a 5 star."
5,Waste King Disposer,"The Waste King L-8000 runs very quiet for a large 1 HP motor. It was easy to install and has presented no problems. It has handled everything put to it, including chicken bones, without stalling or jamming. I was surprised to find it came with an electrical plug as opposed to being hardwired. My previouse disposers were all hardwired so I had to install an outlet under the sink. That is not a major problem if you have some handymand skills. No additional items had to be ordered or purchased - it came complete and ready for installation."
5,Waste King = The way to go,"Great disposal, quiet, very powerful and easy to install - far superior to the Badger series found at the big box stores. For the price, this is the value buy. You'll be happy you purchased it."
5,THE BEST ONE I EVER HAD!,The Waste king Legend 8000 was very easy to install. It is also very quiet and powerful(I never owned a 1HP before). I have nothing but praise for this item. It is a bit longer than insinkerator but it still fit under sink nicely.
4,More Power!!,"This was the first holiday season in 3 years that did not leave me under the sink with the wet vac & tool belt trying to free herb stems and potato peels from the garbage disposal and drains!I'm not a huge fan of the new ""easy collar"" system, but after installing I realized that liberally applying food grade silicone lube to the rubber collar made installation much easier.Most of our food scraps now go directly down the disposal and this thing never hesitates."
5,Easy installation,I read some reviews about difficulty with installation. I consider myself handy but not anything special and this was no problem. This actually runs pretty quiet and I definitely like the lifetime warranty!
5,Great Disposal,"Can't comment on install as my plumber did it, but he had no complaints. It is quiet and very efficient. I haven't tried putting beef ribs down it (like they did on Consumer Reports!), but it makes quick work of the usual kitchen debris. I love that it has a lifetime warranty, that it was CR's top-rated disposal, and that the price was so good. No complaints on shipping time."
2,OLD MODEL L-8000,"We never used a disposer but recently bought WK L-8k for $100 and installed it. L-8k is very old model, heavy and larger than many others (not in production any more). Had to install a combination panel with power outlet and electrical switch to turn it on. The unit is loud and makes some clicking noise on startup. Generally, it works but I would recommend to buy something newer and more advanced. By the way, it is sometime not easy to contact WK customer service and lifetime warranty is applied only to electrical parts of the unit (motor) and corrosion..."
4,Good So Far,"Purchased this product last month. The install was easy, it seems to have plenty of power and runs quiet. Since a 1hp unit cost 2x as much at my local Home Depot I’m very happy with this purchase so far."
5,Waste King L-8000 vs 9980 - Easy installation,"I was debating between the 2 and went with the L8000 due to a big price drop. They are essentially the same, just different ways to attach to the sink drain. I was replacing a Badger 1/3 HP that had cracked after 2 years (never buy a badger - loud and cheap) that had a 3 bolt connection which matches with the 9980. Getting the badger off was a pain, had to use a hammer, but once off, replacing the 3 bolt sink drain with the L8000 EZ connector was very easy. I did read the instructions before starting to understand the process, and then it took about 15 minutes, once I got the old badger off to have the new Waste King installed and running. Much more powerful and not loud with a lifetime warranty. Nice."
2,Does a great job but build quality is not what I expected.,After installing the product I noticed that my old one (15 years unknown brand) was built more solidly. It was all metal construction and had a 3 bolt mounting system. It felt like it was not going anywhere while it was installed. The model comes with the EZ mount system and the drain insert was made of plastic. This results in a very weak connection. I can touch the base of the Waste King and move it around. I can my kids tossing one of the random jugs of cleaning products under the sink and it snapping off. I pray this doesnt happen.Out side of that. The products does what it says. I've already dumped a bunch of food down...more than I normally would just to test and see what it can do. I am happy to say it ginds food very well.Would I buy the product again? Time will tell.
5,Great so far.,We bought it because of its high rating in Consumer Reports. So far it is performing according to their report and it is quieter than any disposer I've ever used.
4,Quiet disposer,I ordered this and replaced an existing insinkerator. Rather the use the existing 3 point attachment I use the EZ that came with it. This was a bit more work than I expected and also installing a special grounded outlet to meet code was an additional expense. The outlet did not connect to the existing plumbing so I had to make some modifications. All in all a bit more work but it does a great job and is quiet. I would recommend it to anyone especially at the Amazon pricing.
4,Waste King L-8000 Legend Series Waste Disposer,This is a very good waste disposer and I found it very easy to install and get it up and running. The 1 HP motor is surprisingly quiet and the unit has done everything I have expected of it. I am pleased with the purchase and operation of this system.
5,Waste King L-8000,"This is a very strong waste disposer, and it is also a very quiet one. We were pleased with the fast delivery fromWaste King."
4,Waste King L-8000,Bought this unit from Amazon. They ship it quickly to my address on next day with FedEx.Installed the Waste King L-8000 so easy. It run very quiet. Everyone loved it.Highly recommend to othrs about this product.
5,Easy install and great operation,"I had my old Badger unit removed and this unit installed in under an hour. That included lowering the T from my double sink since this unit is about 1/4 inch lower than the Badger. You can't beat the lifetime warranty and I verified that Waste King Direct (Cantex Trading) is an authorized retailer. It's not super quiet, but it beats the Badger."
5,Gets it Done,"Does a great job of doing what its supposed to do. Installation was easy once I removed the 3-bolt hardware used by my old Insinkerator and installed the EZ hardware. Only slight complication was I forgot to knock out the dishwasher plug, so had to take the hose back off to knock the plug out, but that was easy. If I had read the instructions, wouldn't have made that mistake. Quieter than the 1/3 hp Insinkerator that it replaced.Update: Month and 1/2 later, and still happy with it. Easily handles anything I throw down there. My old Insinkerator couldn't handle very many onion/carrot/potato skins; but they're gone in a blink in the Waste King."
4,quiet,"So far it is working well. Very quiet and quick. Installed by a professional. The opening is very small, but the splatter guard is removable for easy cleaning and access to the inside."
3,"It's a garbage disposal, works, but not as great as others I've used","It's got a very small opening - it's quiet. It doesn't suck things down unless you push them down first with your hand (when it's off) and then turn it on. I find that annoying... previous garbage disposals had such great suction and pulled the stuff down without me having to push it down. I think this may be due to a 20 year gap between products (old garbage disposal vs. new) and people being afraid of things falling down or getting caught, etc. I'm not sure, but that's my only pet peeve. I don't use it often, but when I do, at least it's relatively quiet."
3,Strong but a bit noisy,"I was replacing my existing ISE 1hp disposal after some 14 years of good service. Waste King is considerably louder than the nice ISE one that I had, but chops up the stuff just as well (actually much better since the grinding blades are new!). Definitely recommend buying the adapter (Waste King 3101 ISE Adapter Kit) if you don't plan on replacing the trim ring inside the sink. Easy to install with the adapter - easier than it was the first time around, and you don't have to worry about buying plumber's putty or matching finishes either.Overall a decent unit, but if money wasn't much of an issue, I would spend the extra $ and get the top model ISE. The Waste King is made in China, and weighed about 1/2 as much as the ISE I replaced.Nice that it comes with the cord already installed, which most don't, and the ez-mount system is much easier to mount than the traditional 3-bolt system."
5,Much quieter!,"Hubby only rcently got around to installing this last weekend so I can't do a long term review. Noticed immediately it is much quieter than the high cost one we had been using for years....and that part I like. As per reviews when I bought this these are good quality, so am hoping for the same luck with mine! Oh and the price was fantastic for such a good little doobie, ha-ha!"
5,Waste King,Easy install. Quiiet. Grinds great. So good my plumber called to get the name so he could recommend to another customer.
1,The Price was right but doesn't grind very well,"The price was definitely right on an Amazon special deal at $99.99. It was easy to install and work nicely. Two cons: 1) a bid noisier than I expected and; 20 the chrome drain mounting ring scratches easily. I would have liked a stainless steel mount.Updated 2/7/12: Doesn't grind anything too fiberous like lemons, oranges or onions. TOO NOISY!! I think this one is defective! It's hard to believe other customers can rate this unit a 5 star. I'm trying to get Waste King to replace mine since I missed the return window with Amazon.com"
1,Very Disappointed!,"I dont know why this disposer gets such good reviews. The disposer is made of cheap plastic, and was a pain to install .I went throuh a lot of trouble replacing the flange that holds the disposer, and the twist-on collar of the disposer wouldn't fit securly without plumbers tape. Then, after 2 weeks of use, the plastic shell began to crack open!. What a dissappointment! I have no idea why consumer reports recommends this disposer over InSinkErator. When I decided to get this disposer, I thought that amazon had a great price for a 1 hp disposer. WRONG. After a bit of research i discovered that the only reason this disposer is labled as a 1 hp disposer is because of a higher starting torque. After a lot of trouble with costomer service, I finally returned it and ordered an evolution excel from ISE. Personally, I think it will worth every extra penny (it was considerably more expensive, but probably well worth it). Final warning: Do not buy this disposer!"
1,disappointed,"Let me start with the one positive aspect of this unit, its very easy to install. Other than that I don't have anything else good to say about it. The unit is as noisy if not more so than my old badger in sink erator. Does not grind up the garbage as quickly as the badger and you can't tell when its empty because the noise level does not change. Over all very disappointed. will keep for awhile but intend to replace with an in sink erator with in a year."
1,Anything but easy install,"I learned of this disposal from Consumer Reports, who gave it a top rating and stated that the ez mount was truly easy to install. I went through the numerous reviews on amazon and came across numerous poor rating, many of which complained that the ez mount was so difficult that they could never mount the disposal. Tick another mark to the the unable to mount column. The cushion mount (gasket) is so oversized that we can not get the mount ring to grab and and mount. Numerous other reviews complined of this exact problem. Also, the help line is closed because it is a sunday and I am stuck calling a plumber in to see if he can get it to mount. Do not bother,BUY A DIFFERENT DISPOSAL, this one is a worthless headache."
4,Waste King 8000,"Purchased to replace worn out disposal in my kitchen. Got the EZ mount model due to my ""expertise"" in plumbing. Took about thirty minutes to install and it works. Would advise using sealant instead of rubber gasket as the drain must be very tight to not leak. Very happy and would purchase again."
5,Waste King L 8000 Legend disposal,"This disposal rocks!!! I don't believe that you can get a better disposal for the money...which was'nt much thru Amazon.com. Lifetime gaurantee, free replacement in home!!! You cannot get any better than that for assurance for this product. As far as performance, this thing is hungry. It doesn't matter what you throw in it, it doesn't miss a beat."
5,Powerful and Quiet!,"Great disposer! Much quieter than the 3/4 HP ISE Badger 5 it replaced. The ISE had started to leak from 3 different places after about 5 years. The Waste King L-8000 was cheaper to purchase from Amazon with overnight shipping than to purchase another ISE at a big box store. It's more powerful and quieter than the ISE too. Really a much nicer disposer all around. Installation was dead simple and no additional parts were required. This was the first disposer I've replaced on my own. I changed out the mount to the new one that came with it. No reason not to and I was able to get rid of the ugly gray putty that was peeking out from under the old collar and use the rubber gasket provided. I had it installed and working in about 30 minutes with going back and forth between the manual and sink to make sure I was doing it right. I can't see going back to the other brand any time soon and with the lifetime warranty, I shouldn't have to!"
4,Waste King L-8000 Disposal,"Although we had a plumber install it, it appears much like the other two I've installed...good instructions, etc. It is fairly large, but I believe that to be for silencing and the power (1 HP). As far as noise, I don't think it quite as quiet as expected by me or desired by my wife...but we installed a new sink at the same time, so it may be resonance from that, too. For the price here, and the quality reviews all over the Internet, we are very happy."
3,"Not bad, but not great either","Works good, light and easy to install without any leaks, so meets expectations there. minus two stars for having a small throat, there is no way I can get my hand down there to clear a jam or remove unwanted objects, and I'm not happy about having to get my 11 year old to stick his hand down there. Also not too pumped about how it sucks things down, which is not at all. I have one in my old house that would suck anything right off of the rubber once it fell into the throat, I like that, this one won't suck anything down unless you jam it down through the rubber, which means jamming a wood spoon down into the disposal all the time. Its just a matter of time before it gets down too far and into the blades."
2,Not so great,"I read the reviews before ordering this and they seemed generally good, however my plumber said this was very hard to install and was not impressed with the quality. It seems noisier than other disposals I have used."
3,Waste King L-8000 Legend Series 1.0-Horsepower Continuous Feed Garbage.,Using it for more than year. No problem. I wish it can come with shorter collar. It is tough to get the pipe connected when you are remodeling and you are stuck with existing outlet.
1,Violated Consumer Reports no advertising policy.,"The seller of the Waste King L-8000 violated a long-standing, well-known, highly-pulbicized, court-supported policy of Consumer Reports by identifying Consumer Report's rating of this product on its invoice. Had we known this is what they would be doing, we would not have purchased it from them."
1,TOO MASSIVE FOR A NORMAL SINK!,"Ordered the unit in November and finally got the plumber out for the install in late January. He had renovations being done all the while so there was a reason for the wait. This unit is the largest garbage disposal I have ever seen in my life. If it were installed, it would have a 1-inch gap between the bottom of the disposal and the bottom of the kitchen cabinet under the sink. What's worse? Since the unit is so large, you will absolutely have to re-route your plumbing. If I had mine installed it was going to cost another $400-500 in plumbing to correctly hook it up. This unit should only be used in extra tall cabinets and commercial applications."
3,Dependable but loud,"Good unit, easy to install, works like a champ. Just very loud. The first sound suppressor for the sink ring kept falling into the unit, had to order a replacement."
1,Noisy,Should not have believed high ratings. Hard to mount and loud. Next time I'll go back to a Craftsman. Usable. May last too long. Who knows.
3,Too soon to rate,It was relatively easy to install. But most of the complaints were about the cheap plastic case and the chrome ring. Problems seem to occur a couple of months after the install. So the only thing I can judge in the installation. I had no problems in that area.
4,solid unit,We were having problems with our old GE disposal not grinding food small enough and pipes getting clogged after installing the waste King 8000 problem fixed. Unit works great has a life time in home replacement warranty including labor the only short coming is the noise it is as loud as our old disposal small price for such power
5,Very pleased,"First disposal to install and did it myself! (as a girl, I was thrilled I could do it myself) It was a lot easier than I expected . Took the suggestions I read and used a car jack to hold up the old disposal to remove and install this one. I'm very pleased with this purchase. For the price, I got more HP and a better warranty than one I was considering at Lowe's - and saved $60!"
4,"Good product, spotty final packaging.","I bought this on a black Friday deal to replace a 13 year old badger.My requirements were quiet and powerful.This is definitely quiet and very powerful.My only complaint is that the product didn't come with a rubber gasket for mounting the waste line below the dishwasher hookup and the plastic waste pipe they included was cheap and broke right away. Also the waste collar used was too large and would have caused leaks.I ended up using the waste gasket and pipe from my old badger on this new disposal and it works fine.The other issue I ran into was that this is a LARGE unit. It wouldn't fit under my sink without reworking the pipes. So I had to cut my water lines, use some shark bite to reconnect and then it fit.I would buy this again."
1,Almost Worthless,Thermometer is inaccurate. Compass doesn't work. No point to have if 2 out of 3 don't work.
4,Clock/Compass/Thermometer,The clock/compass/thermometer arrived in a timely matter and we are happy with the product. Thanks for good service!
1,NOT WORTH THE SMALL PRICE.,THIS IS THE WORST PIECE OF JUNK. THE CLOCK WILL NOT SET PROPERLY . ALSO THE COMPASS IS OFF BY MANY DEGREES REGARDLESS OF LOCATION.
4,Great clipper at a reasonable price,"Pros:- Solid quality- Flat cutting edgeCons:- These things are huge, so you won't be able to operate these easily unless your hands are large.- Since the cutting edge is flat, you'll have to clip 2 or 3 times more on each nail. This creates a large number of clippings, and they fly all over the place.Overall:Despite the negatives, I love these clippers. If this was 20% smaller, I would give it 5 stars."
3,Good clippers,I have thick toenails so these are great for me. They are a little flimsier than i thought they would be but they still work...
3,Just an average pair of clippers.,"I bought this item for my Dad who prefers to use straight-edge nail clippers as opposed to the curved-edge nail clippers. When they arrived, I tried them on my own finger nails. The cutting edge is sharper than your old nail clippers but, not by as much as one should expect. Nice stainless steel with matte finish and not really that large. Really nothing special but, they get the job done.Bottom line - unless you really need/want a straight-edge nail clipper, buy the MEHAZ Professional Toenail clipper (model 662) for the same price as this Tweezerman. They are sharper and fit your hand much more comfortably."
1,"""Complete Decry"" isn't.","While I was somewhat shocked to see a compilation from a one time great, but under-rated punk band, the ""Complete Decry"" title is misleading. This release doesn't include their first 7"" in it's entirety and the only version of ""Falling"" included is the metal version from their first album, which played as if it were an encore. Both versions should have been included. Also missing is ""Last Sin"" from the ""Barricaded Suspects"" comp. If Farrel is trying to ressurect Decry like it states in the liner notes, I'm sure these tracks will be added as ""bonus tracks"" to their new release to try and entice old fans to buy it. I would have paid the same price for just the 7"" and comp. tracks! I feel taken advantage of getting half of what I thought I was paying for. The other tracks are mediocre attempts at mid-eighties ""hair bands"" and not worth the money."
5,"o,g in the house","hi everybody i feel, that all the reviews are great! it makes me fell good that people enjoy the band. except that person that didnt like it. if your wondering who i is,LoL im g-money the manager that took care of this guys on 2 tour. Im going to see if these guys would want to get together for a small gig in hollyworld.if so everybody should come."
3,Old stars are today's superstars!,"I own over 150 wrestling dvd's and vhs tapes. This was about Smoky Mountain Wrestling which had a lot of wrestlers that I had not seen in a long time. Almost every wrestler on this dvd is wrestling on either WWE Raw or Smackdown, ECW, TNA. In my opinion there were very good wrestlers on it but the matches were pretty bad and the filming was even worse. Some of the commentary by Jim Cornette was fairly good he added a lot of facts that were very interesting that I liked best of all on the dvd."
3,The Pit is watchable and Hellgate is unwatchable,The Pit is an odd black-horror comedy that feels like a David Lynch movie mixed with a goosebump episode with a little boy named Jamie Benjamin who has an obsession with sex and then befriends a group of monsters called Trogs that eat people and then for revenge he feeds them the neighborhood bullies and even his babysitter. The Pit is filmed in Wisconsin on a low-budget with an unknown cast. This is not a kids movie because of the violence and nudity.Hellgate is a waste of time with Ron Palillo(Horseshack from Welcome Back Kotter)visting a ghost town and battling zombie-like creatures. They should have put The Pit with a better movie.
3,re-living the pit,"I agree, seeing The Pit again as an adult, you do see David Lynch like references. I found it to be a bit more humorous than others did, watching how Jamie leads victims to the Pit.I found it enjoyable as I actually grew up in the town where this was filmed, seeing your friends and neighbors in the movie was a blast! Jamie could have been the kid I babysat for very easily! Glad to find this movie on DVD!"
5,good book better then Vol. 3,The book is good overview of what was hot on art. It makes you want to see more art great book to have.
2,"Good for Some, Bad for Many","Seems to me that only die-hard Lord of the Rings fans would buy this and other similar books, but if they are indeed die-hard fans, they will learn nothing new from this book at all. It's really meant for children. There are likely many similar ones as well. It does come with a poster of the Balrog, though!"
3,let down,"Not what I remember a swiss army knife being, feels light and cheap. The scales have the slightest rattle. The scales feel thin and cheap. The main blade is barely sharp. I don't know, it feels cheap and not well put together. I think I will stick with the aluminum scaled solider model."
4,good product for the money,"i bought this for ice fishing and was pleased with what i could do with it. fits propan tanks well also, looks great on your atv. only fall back is plastic is kind of thin and cheap, side storage could be a bit bigger."
5,an attention grabber,"I like true crime and historical novels and this one has it all. It is a terrible story, makes your stomach turn over in places but it is because it is true. Texas is my home state and I have read a lot about it but this novel brings things in that I knew nothing about. The 1920s is also interesting to me and this happened in an area and among people whose lives I knew nothing about. I really, really liked it."
5,Electronic Folk Music With Brains and Heart,"I just never get tired of this album, and I guess that's the highest compliment I can bestow on the artist.I remember catching the 99.9F video on MTV when they had Suzanne Vega do an hour as a guest VJ to promote the album. I was hooked from the first listen and had to hear more. I went right out to the record store (you remember record stores, right?) and bought the CD.17 years later, it is still on my CD shelf, still gets prominent play time, and is a permanent fixture on my iPod.It's adventurous, unique, and somewhat hypnotizing in its beauty. I guess it's out of print now so go find it in the marketplace, get it cheap, open your ears and enjoy!"
1,PRODUCT SENT TO WRONG ADDRESS,It was sent to my summer home by mistake. I would like to reorder and have it sent to my Cincinnati address.
4,Perfect Light,"Great ""daylight"" shine for my lamp. I use this light for my oil painting hobby and I can't paint without it."
4,OttLite B24553 24W Tube Replacement,It is too hard to get overly excited by a light bulb (tube) replacement. It works. It will be interesting to see if it lasts 10K hours.
5,Among the Best Transcription Projects I Ever Made,"Many years ago before I began my music website I first transcribed this complete book, including even making my own solos for it, as the score indicated. It was the greatest music education I ever got. The music, and many others like it (Larry Corryell's Eleventh House, Chick Corea's Electric Band, Weather Report, The Flock, Jeff Beck, etc.) had a profound impact on my musical development. But then I ""moved"" on to my current 19th century public domain music transcriptions and arrangements. It still has the same effect on me though which I've always appreciated. Highly recommended for any serious composition student, and more so for guitarists (which I also play <g>)."
5,The Ultimate Search for Perfection,"What better way than to have the original score sheet from the composer? I have been learning some MO pieces by ear off and on for a few years. The fact that you get the parts for bass, violin, keys and even drums makes this an incredible value. I spent at least 2 hours trying to figure out the perfect 4th run at the very beginning of One Word and this shows exactly how it is played. The chords you will find in here are fantastic. Use this book with Ted Greenes Chord Chemistry and you will be astounding your friends and students with how wide you can stretch your fingers on some of these chords. As one guy wrote, the time signatures are out of this world, so get the recordings to hear how to play. Or if you have mastered a few dozen bebop riffs(heads) then you should be able to read and play through some of the more complex single note lines. I am surprised this book has not sold out, this is the closest thing to be able to play modern jazz as the Real Book."
2,Much To Be Desired,"I was disappointed with this selection. I thought the book would have been of the large format style but actually found it to be somewhat undersized. I also found many of the photos to be a underexposed. Doing a book profiling the rear assets of the female form one would expect accenting the various circular shapes and angles and the protruding qualities therein, which I found to be lacking in this book. Lastly, while I don't favor any one ethnic group over the other, I do find the book lacking in representation of various ethnic groups. I'm sure anyone would agree that African American women have more than ample proportions, and find it quite disturbing that a book with the title ""DERRIERES"" exclude such subjects that have been know for their rather bulbous bottoms. A book show casing such a glorious area of the female anatomy should have included a more diverse ethnic representation."
4,My observation was,"My observation was that it is good. Its a photography book. It has exactly what is promised. True, the book is not exhaustive, and while some of the pictures are more refined than others. That ancient character is able to shine through."
5,Derrieres,"This is a fine collection of photographs concerning one of the most erotic curves of the human female body. It is presented in a respectful manner, without getting pornographic. However, I believe pornography is in the mind of the beholder, and if anyone thinks that looking at provocative pictures celebrating the enigmatic bottom is not normal, it is my belief that that person has some deeply rooted problems. We are all human, driven by our carnal desires, for without them we would not exist as the human race.Ancient cultures believed that a bigger size derriere was much more desirable, as the bigger the posterior, the stronger the thrust, thus better sex. One need only observe baboons to prove this theory.I highly recommend this book for anyone who appreciates a beautiful derriere."
3,If you're looking for something lightweight and not expensive . . .,"This product is lightweight - I expected it to be heavier. It looks good in the picture, but the real product does not look like leather. I might have returned it, but my husband liked it."
4,Adequate Toiletry Case,"This was exactly what I wanted, but it suffices. The seller was excellent. I have no complaints regarding the transaction. I am just disappointed I was unable to replace the travel case that was stolen."
1,Almost junk,"It looks like a a leather type product, but upon arrival, I was very disappointed to see it. It's made of some cheap plastic that can be easily torn. At the same time, you can expect much, since it was very cheap. Spend a little more and get something nicer. I threw mine away."
3,O.K. Tailgate Cap,"The tailgate cap looks fine, but it needs to be a little bigger to make it easier to cover the holes in the tailgate top."
3,no where near original equipment,You get what you pay for. Item is cheaply made and hardly worth the $$$. Noncontinuous tape leaves for separation between cap and tailgate. When this one breaks I will not replace it with another. Invest more money into a better product.
2,a bit off,Just not up to par for us. Could be a bit more traditional. Unless you already know who they are and how they perform save your money.
5,Great family saga,"Mimi Myerson, head of the Myerson family company of cosmetics and perfumes, rescued her grandfather's failing company and turned it into a huge, successful empire.She's about to launch a new fragrance,Mireille, named after herself, at the cost of a multi million dollar advertising campaign which could turn them back into a private company if successful or cripple them financially if the new fragrance doesn't ""take"". Family rivalries and jealousies threaten her venture and episodes from the past come back to haunt various family members. If you enjoy a big family saga with lots of descriptions of fashion, jewels, magnificent houses and furnishings, this is the book for you...I loved it !"
3,Pretty good,"IThis album is in the typical mid80 's sound like TOTO. The debut album is good but the level drops in the end. A classical westcoast album, so: Great voice and arrangements."
4,Hog Honda speaks out;,"This was a great first release for John, but I'm a bit biased. John was the lead singer in my band in the early to mid 60's. The name of the band was, Hog Honda & The Chainguards. Keep making music OB, you've got a great voice."
4,Got to love it!!!,"If you love Disney movies with a jungle flair, this is a great CD to own. It has songs you and the kids can't help but sing and dance too. If you love The Lion King and The Jungle Book, you have to have this."
5,Toe Tappin' Good Fun!,"Not only do the kids know all the words to these songs, but so will you, and will be singing them in the shower!"
4,"""This was a man!""","Professor Holmes is a British military historian and it shows in this interesting attempt at describing Winston Churchill's character. He decidedly has an opinion, usually conservative, on most political and social issues of the last century and is happy to share them with the reader. He also spends more time on battle issues in the two world wars than would most authors of a character study of this type. This book is best for readers who have some prior knowledge of the life of Winston Churchill. The professor points out many of the faults and warts of his subject but the ultimate verdict is in recognition of his genius."
2,too much verbiage,"I read the introduction and the first chapter, then gave up. This author, Richard Holmes, writes long, complicated sentences, using many more words than needed to make his points. At times his meaning seems hidden by piles of verbiage. I often wondered, what did he actually say. That got old fast.In my short read, I found 2 points contradicting other narratives of Churchill's early life.Other books I recall, say young Churchill provided money for his beloved nurse Mrs. Everest after the family let her go with no pension. This book says he didn't, implying he was selfish for not doing so, instead focusing on getting as much money as he could out of his mother for his own wants.Other books say Churchill was psychologically neglected by his parents. This book says instead he was too emotionally demanding of attention from them, not that they were cold and unloving. And that he should have realized this treatment was normal for kids of that time and class."
1,Tey should have quit B 4 this....,"I've been friends with Dave and the guys for years. The original Ballsac (Steve) even helped with the final mix on my first CD. So it hurts me to say this, but if you like Gwar you'll hate this. The end of a great band, and the start of greater embarrassments to come...."
1,This Toilet Band,"A friend played me this c.d. and I couldn't believe my ears!!! This is BAD noise. I get more pleasure listening to the stray cats that fight outside my window at night. I don't get this band, Is it the shock value? or the fact that they want to be original with this awful sound? Well, I guess, to each their own, but since this is my review I'd have to rate this as pathetic. Can I give this minus 5 stars??"
2,Aluminum Products,I purchased the SIGG aluminum water bottles to be more environmentally friendly; however I just learned stainless steel is the better material of choice. Aluminum although light weight has to be lined with something to make sure the contents are safe for drinking. Usually it is lined with baked on epoxy (toxic) or ceramic (can crack). I have also heard aluminum toxicity has been linked to many health conditions.
3,Buenos Aires Review,"This was my first Rough Guide purchase as I have always been a fan of Lonely Planet. I bought the Argentina guide since it was published recently and used it specifically for a trip to Buenos Aires. I thought that the information was relatively good in terms of descriptions of neighborhoods in general, but not detailed enough for my tastes. Pricing is difficult, even for a very recent edition, due to the inflation in Argentina. However, I prefer Lonely Plant for giving more substantive historical backgrounds in their guides as well as telling it as it is in their hotel, restaurant, etc. reviews."
3,"Better than some, but not for the student traveler","I liked this better than the Frommer's guides, but I think the Lonely Planet guide does a better job. As a traveler on a student's budget, I didn't find this particular guide to be that useful or user-friendly. It IS informative and can be useful (language section, brief culture/history section, health section, etc.) but as I said, it wasn't right for me.I suggest the Lonely Planet guide to Argentina."
2,book fell apart even before the trip,"I have many travel books including rough guides and even after travelling around they remain in good condition, i have only read parts of the book and the first 15 pages just fell out - very annoyed as more will probably fall out and this will not wear well on the trip"
3,RG Argentina guide,I bought this book for a three week trip with one week in Buenos Aires and the rest throughout the country. As with at RG guides this book is great to someone who is looking for tons of suggestions beyond the hotel guides. The one thing I found frustrating were how poor the maps were which is an area Rough Guide has needed to work on for years.
3,Argentina Rough Guide not as a great as other Rough Guides,"I've been a rough guide user since the company started, and have gone through 6 or7 7 rough guides. When this one arrived in the mail, I was very excited to get my hands all over it. While it had plenty of information, and the usual casual but informative style, we found that information in it wasn't always reliable. Prices tended to be off, which may reflect more upon Argentina's economy than the rough guides. But there just seemed to something off with the organization of the information, some of the locations on maps were incorrectly placed, and busing information was poorly documented. Because I'm partial to the rough guide style, I would probably buy this book again...after all nobody's perfect."
1,Excellent content - lousy binding,"though the content of this guide is excellent, the binding is absolutely apalling! i have had this book for one week and it is already falling apart! entire pages are falling out! i can only imagine what it's going to look like, once i have read the entire book....."
4,Good travel guide,"Purchased this for my daughter, who was preparing for a semester abroad. It helped her get a good idea of what to expect in Argentina."
1,Concerning.,"My husband and I find the videos to be a bit concerning. The young girls in the movie are wearing short dresses, and their underwear is visible when they are sitting. In the shapes video, one of the girls is wearing a dress with a see-through top. I think these things are not appropriate to have in a children's program like this. They should have screened it for things like this.The kids won't notice it, but as a parent, like I said, I don't think it's quite right."
2,Not for older kids,"My daughter was very disappointed with this DVD. She didn't even make it past the first half hour because she said it was so boring. She kept saying - ""when are they finally doing something else"". My daughter is 3 1/2 - I did not realize this DVD was intended from INFANT to four years of age - there is barely any action. I am sure it is good for younger children, for older kids it just does not hold their attention - but - maybe it started getting better after half an hour - we will not know since my daughter decided to not finish it."
2,Disappointed,"This book is very interesting, but its format is odd, making it difficult to read the book and absorb its important content."
2,Caller Can't Hear Very Well,"No matter who I am talking to on this phone, they are not able to hear me very well. I get a lot of ""I can barely hear you."", ""Sounds like you aren't talking into the receiver."", etc... I have had many people complain about this and I make sure to talk loud and directly into the receiver but it doesn't help. Frustrating since I have an at home business."
1,Broken in less than a month,"I bought this phone because I needed a cordless phone/answering machine combo without a lot of fancy extras. In less than one month the answering machine portion is dead - no power, will not work, completely broken. Do not waste your money."
4,GE cordless phone with answering machine,"I like the looks, the sound, and the features on this phone with one exception. Other phones have a directory for your friends numbers which is alphabetical and easy to access. This phone you assign your friend with a number. So when you push 1, that is Sue; when you push 2, that is Mary; 3 is John; 4 is Tom. It is hard to remember where to find a number."
2,Died in 10 months,Worked good until the handset audio quality all of the sudden became very poor overnight. Sent it to GE/Thomson (after a very lengthy drilling by them by phone) on my dime and 8 wks later was told they had no replacement and 3 wks later was given a refund. Not fair and wont buy their phones again.
2,Caller ID Display Failure,"I wanted an inexpensive phone for my kitchen. Sadly, with this phone, you get what you pay for. The call quality is very poor. It has a lot of static - sounds like you're in a tunnel. Also, after 1 year, the caller ID display failed. Now you can only see bits and pieces of words and numbers. There is no way to obtain a number of a missed call if the caller didn't leave a message.To summarize, save your money and buy another phone."
2,We have been disappointed...,"I recently purchased this phone and answering system on clearance at Staples, thinking that I had gotten a great deal. Unfortunately, the quality of the answering system is poor, so that we can hardly understand what many folks are saying when they leave messages. Also, it takes a few seconds for the phone to turn on after pressing the ""Talk"" button, which is an annoyance. We're still glad to have this phone as an upgrade over the dying phone that it replaced, but I was definitely hoping for a better quality phone, with the ability to record clear messages. Is that too much to ask?"
2,What else can go wrong?,"It looked good--but when I plugged it in, the charge light wouldn't stop flashing. I unplugged it--did all the things customer service told me to do--no luck. Now it won't take my message retrieval code.And I can't find the box with the warranty"
4,Rossini-La Gazza,I have enjoyed it and am happy with my choice.Well worth the money and I am very pleased with the product well done
3,alright,"Good shipping, product was not the best though. The shaft was loose and had a lot of movement but alright for the price"
3,Good Product but seems slow,"A good product, but it seems a little slow. I'm used to my 8GB jump drives and they are just faster (well come models like those by Corsair), but this puppy seems slow."
2,Not a quality product,"The plastic smell thet these little bottles exude is Intolerable. I was going to use them for vitamins and medication but the stench was so strong I decided to put water in one first. The result was water that tasted like turpentine. I rinsed and refilled it several times hopping it would wear off but no dice. Even left it sitting full of salt water for a week, but it was still putrid."
4,In pursuit of vikings,"Amon Amarth delivers the goods with this 3 disc live collection. The first disc is from Cologne 2005, and features the Fate of Norns setlist. Johan belts out the growls as the rest of the band pounds away. The other 2 discs are just as good, and gives you a pretty wide collection of Viking metal at its finest. There's some behind the scenes stuff, too, but mostly just eardrum bursting metal. My wife wonders why I keep walking around the living room yelling ""Odin, guide our ships, our axes, spears and swords!"" I guess I haven't grown out of it after all. ;-)"
5,Dont stop war is here!,These dvd's show the true brutality of Amon Amarth. I have watched and rewatched these dvds and they never get old. Join me brothers for we ride to war!!!
5,At last a reissue of this great album,"and good quality soundwise.in addition to what other reviewers wrote, in 1984 an issue of 7songs came out which contained 'the gospel comes to new guinea' 'last words' and 'just like everybody else' and did not contain 'IY'.the three former songs are now on the new compilation album 'the gospel comes to new guinea'anyway, great fun."
1,Awful pieces of garbage,"These smoke detectors are a living nightmare. They only go off at night.... another reviewer likened them to the living dead... good analogy. DO NOT BUY THESE OR ANY OTHER FIREX PRODUCTS, IMHO THEY ARE CHEAP, SHODDY WORKMANSHIP AND HORRIBLE ENGINEERING. The builder put these in my home just to torment me. Beazer, the builder from hell...did this to me."
3,Not Plain White!,"It's a nice heavy cardstock and in some circumstances would work well for the application for what I was using it for. Unfortunately, it's not a plain white cardstock (which is what I was looking for). It's a slight off white with multicolor flecks. I wish it had said this in the description. Just goes to show you, always check reviews before buying!"
4,Good Cardstock,"This is exactly what I needed some good stiff cardstock. It is flecked with colors, but hey it says that in the description I guess I just missed it. Still worked for what I needed!"
5,Beautiful and moving,"I can't recommend this book highly enough. I don't normally go for urban (or in this case rural) fantasy, preferring my fantasy to be based off Earth but I couldn't help being spellbound by this.The narrative, characters, character ""arcs"", description, pacing, mood - all excellent, with incredible attention to detail. How many other writers, writing about an outsider, the decline of a relationship, your in-laws, loss, childbirth, the fragility of the human body, actually create something as worthwhile, poignant and true as this? How many of them actually have something new or meaningful to say? This book has the feel of someone really getting their teeth into the subject, squeezing every scene and character interaction for all it's worth - fantasy is much better off for this book being written. Shame on fantasy readers for letting such a gem fall out of print!You should buy it. It's terrific."
3,Stupid is as stupid does - mini spoiler alert,"While I do think this is a well written book (and I love all of Megan Lindholm/Robin Hobb's work) I do find the main character incredibly frustrating.As an independant woman, I cannot understand the inherently stupid decisions and lack of backbone of the main character. Made more so infuriating by the awful in-law family which would make one more feisty, well a normal person anyway.Was also very confused by the book restarting back to chapter 9 halfway through the book ... unless I got a dud copy, where was the part when she finally leaves hubby and goes off to the forest? One minute at the funeral and then back to chapter 9 again??? WTFDefinately not as good as the Ki and Vandien quartet or the Reindeer People or Alien Earth."
3,News Of The World,"This is a fine book, but a warning: having been written by Brits for Brits, it is (understandably) Anglo-centric. Unless you are planning on covering the Coventry city council or writing up scorecards for Cricket matches, this book may not be for you. Yanks should search out an American alternative."
5,Not that there's anything wrong with Disney ...,"But didn't someone once that we'll always have Paris? And that's the Paris I wanted to share with my son but needed a guide to. For Disney, I'll use the website. I loved this book for its assumption that kids find history and culture cool, too. You just have to share it in a kid-friendly way, and this book constantly reminds us of that: kids need to swim, play, rest; and they don't care if every moment of the trip costs $$--This book's giving me ideas about things I know will appeal to my 10-year-old son at a level that's for him. I also liked the sidebars for tips."
2,"OK, but there are better ones out there.","No maps, no discussion of Disney paris, A must for children in Paris. A better one is by Truszkowski, which has great color pics and maps and better info."
4,Take Me to Your Leader$,"Confidence is what makes salespeople great and Sam's trinity concept is the best method I've seen to get it. Sam explains how to overcome the fear of networking and the fear of asking for critical information to win orders. Greg Stover, VP Sales"
2,Unrealistic,Sounds good but no way to live. Way too strict to be relatable. The science was good but this book isn't a keeper in my library.
5,Take a Load off Your Heart,I gave it as a gift. My bother-in-law just have 5 by-pass surgery. My sister requested this title by name.
5,Packed with great tips and info,Finally a book that is not extremely dumbed down like others tend to be. This book is fun to read with lots of good tips. This is one of the better books so pick up a copy. This is a somewhat thick book so it's not a 30 minute book but you could probably read it in 2 or 3 days.
2,Only listened to a 3 track demo,"No one would confuse this with classical music, and its really ambient in style. But why such sleeper arrangements? This had me yawning from ear to ear from start to finish. Hey Bill! Hope you put something with a little more fire in it on the rest of the album!"
1,Horrible Bore,This is a great record if you want something to put you asleep faster than NyQuil. You are much better off finding the origional peices of music and enjoying them. BUT if you can find the dance version of Adagio For Strings grab it in a heartbeat...an amazing soaring peice of music
1,a waste of fifteen dollars and ninteen cents,This cd was the worst cd i had ever bought. The cd was also very very boring. William Orbit should made all the songs faster and not-so-long. The only good thing about this cd is that the second disk which is a remix. But the remix cd only contains two tracks but they are ok.Overall this cd is just garbage and a waste of money. People who like instrumental music that really is boring this is the cd for you.
4,Soothing tracks -- good for bedtime or in front of the PC,"This cd was not disappointing by any stretch. If you're looking for really cutting edge techno/electronic versions of these classics, don't buy it. If you're looking for some soothing adaptations of time-honoured melodies, then by all means, buy it immediately!I agree with the other person who reviewed this cd and said something to the effect of ""read between the lines"" of the other reviews. Is it genius? No. Is it good? Absolutely."
3,Out of Orbit.,"CAUTION: THIS IS NOT A DANCE ALBUM. These are somber, minimalistic synth variations on classical pieces, extremely low-key and best suited for bedtime. That said, the album as a whole is fairly interesting, like a strange nocturnal soundtrack to a David Lynch movie. (May or may not be accompanied by a bonus CD with two so-so dance remixes.)"
4,candy for the spirit,"this is an album to relax to. just put all your worries aside, put this record on and just let your mind, body and soul relax...Orbit has been true to the originals, but he has added a litte 2000 flavour... maybe this is classical music for the 21 century.This is a good by for anyone who enjoys classical music and ambient (other than Enya).take care everyone."
3,Tranquility personified,"If you like music that provide ambience and a sense of total tranquility, then this CD is for you. 'Pieces in a Modern Style' is very relaxing, so much so that it makes you feel as if you're drifting away! Despite its serene nature, I was expecting more from this album. I envisaged that the classical pieces would be completely transformed, in a sense that they would be presented in a more 'up-beat' tempo. The sound also comes across as being a bit too 'mechanical' at times doesn't offer anything too adventurous or remarkable. Nevertheless, this album is perfect for chilling out and relaxing, and that's as far as it will allow you to go."
3,Give the man a break...,"Nothing earthshattering here,but still deserving of a listen. I wish more electronic musicians would share their classical roots with us as Orbit has bravely done. This beautiful collection would be complete if he had added a selection by J.S. Bach."
2,Not worth the plastic to press it...,"I bought this CD before reading the review on Amazon, however even if I had I probably would have made the purchase anyway. That said....It is undeniably the worst piece of crumpled, recycled, techno-classical music imaginable. If you have a collection of the most awful music you have ever heard, this is an absolute must have.If you don't, steer very clear of this disk."
2,silly rabbit-electronica are for kids!,"My God how you dissapoint me orbit! This album is intended for the classical fan, not for the electronic buff, its too mellow, slow, basically goes nowhere. The songs cut off, no ending just the meledy or highlights of sections. If your thinking Madonna think again!"
2,"All technology, no feeling","Orbit achieves fine instrumentation, but no expression. I expected someone of his standing to break new ground in recording electronica versions of classical pieces, particularly in squeezing emotional expressiveness out of the machinery. No such luck: the renditions are flat. Orbit may be a good composer, but doesn't show talent as a conductor. Thus, I wouldn't recommend this album for folks who are already classical listeners. ""Pieces in a Modern Style"" really feels like massage parlor music."
1,Simply put: Bad.,"Okay, I happen to own Strange Cargo CDs, and I like them. I own Isao Tomita's albums as well - yes, the man who has been playing classical music on synthesizers since 1974, and yes, I like them all.Pieces, however, gets it all wrong. The album tracks are boring, the most interesting track (the remix of Barber's Adagio) in not on the CD at all, but on a single.If you can, compare ""Pavane"" from Orbit with the version played by Tomita back in 1979, on the Ravel album Daphnis et Cloé. While Orbit's version seems flat, Tomita playes the same work with much more emotion.If you like classics played on keyboards, you should really check out Tomita's work. If you expect to find anything like ""Water from a vine leaf"" (Strange Cargo 3), then don't buy this album."
1,A huge disappointment,"It didn't have to be dance music, or even upbeat. What it should have been was good, like all the rest of William Orbit's music I have heard.This album was just awful. Don't waste your money. If you want to hear W.O. at his best, get Strange Cargo III or Madonna's Ray of Light."
2,"Lofty goal, feeble execution.","I'm a huge WO fan (yes, even his work with Madonna, which no doubt played no small part in her musical resurrection) and while you can pick out definite stylistic traits, this is just not well executed at all.The string pads seem to be ubiquitous throughout, and it's not even an expressive string pad! There is little emotion here, like a lot of modern synthetic sounds, and so he's quite right: these are indeed pieces in a modern style.If you want true-to-form synthesized symphonic music, try Jarre's ""Equinoxe"" or Schulze's ""Timewind"" for starters."
2,Disappointing,"I got this CD thinking it would be as good as Best of Strange Cargos. Unfortunately this album is a waste of time. It actually depresses me because it fills my head with white noise. It your to spend the money, get a Strange Cargos CD."
2,Ambient - Not Trance,"Don't be fooled by the Ferry Corsten's awesome remix of William Orbit's Barber's Adagio for Strings track -- This does not at all represent William Orbit's cd. This cd is almost entirely slow, ambient takes on classical music."
3,Horses for courses,"Few people would claim that this is a work of great aesthetic beauty, or that it is stylistically original, lively or engaging. If the album is purchaed with these expectations in mind, disappointment is likely.As an Ambient album however, it is extremely effective. The gentle pace, warm sounds, and well known melodies slowly stir the dozing uncritical consciousness back into life. Among the many Ambient works, from Eno to Aphex, few serve this purpose so well."
2,Fusion attempt gone retrohaywire,"I tried, I really tried. I took him to work with me. I listened to him as I drove through the mountains. I gave him my undivided attention on the headphones in the living room. But, try as I might, there's not much good I can say about ""Pieces in a Modern Style.""Purists will be aghast at the electronic reworking of compositions by Ravel, Beethoven, Handel and others; the ambient crowd will yawn with boredom at the undoubtedly high-tech production that goes out of its way to sound low-tech.The result: Unless you really want to see what pouty, posturing synth artists (lose the cover art already!) do when they decide it's time to make Serious Music, stay away. You can find better electronic music; you can find better classical music. Taken together, neither side wins here."
3,Notes from a CD collector on an oddly steady decline,"Well, unfortunately Orbit seems to be getting deeper into the Wyndham Hill sound...it's really a shame. I respect the effort, and a lot of is good enough to put on in the background, its just no fun to listen to closely...I have to own it nonetheless....here's why:Collectors: William Orbit CDs are fun to collect, because they're hard to come by, and you can really follow a consistent sound develop and change, that many years ago made you think he was going to break Techno into the mainstream...look for Bassomatic stuff; it still sounds fresh after a decade. The better sounding and produced recording is the second one (heavy traces of Norman Cook), but I prefer ""Heart of the Base""...or whatever it was called...you'll have to sniff it out :-) Also, look for his remixes on Guerilla Records, of which he used to be part. Incredible stuff, LOTS of releases."
1,Why wasn't I told about the remix CD?,Supermaket version of classical favourites! Adds nothing worthwhile to the original pieces. why does MTV (Europe) run the Adagio for Strings video without telling us that it is a remix not to be found on the normal album. I want a refund!
2,A poor CD,"Alas, the original Amazon review is correct. This album is well produced but also very kitch. Beethoven in ambient soup is almost as bad as ""Smoke on the water"" sung by Pat Boone. I think that Orbit could have made a much better album by reinterpreting (open) jazz standards. I believe that there is no need to rearrange pieces of classical music that are perfect and complete in themselves. So I can only explain this CD as a cash-in operation after the successful Madonna album.My humble advice is, to those who like easy-listening classical music: buy the originals (classical CDs are often sold at a bargain price), since they provide a much pleasant, authentic listening experience. To those who are curious about ambient, buy any CD of the Orb, or Boards of Canada, or Plaid, or even the classic Eno."
4,At last!,"I think this cd was a great idea! The thought of mixing great classical songs with techno always appealed to me, and finally someone has done it! For those of you who dont agree with me, go buy the plain originals. No harm done. My only complaint with this cd is a slight one, and purely my oppinion... the beats are a little hollow, slightly repetative and pop sounding. Personally, I think it would be 10 times better if it had more of a full, thick sound. If it had been a Crystal Method or Chemical Brothers remix, or had more of that sound, I would give it 5 stars. But since it is a simple oppinion, and I know alot of people in Europe like the style of sound he used, all compliments to ya Orbit!"
2,"Been there, heard that.","This album was interesting back in 1968 -- it was called ""Switched on Bach"" by Wendy Carlos.I was hoping for a record that would expand upon the innovations of 20th century music while adding a fresh twist to the classics. What I got was a set of (admittedly well-produced) MIDI tracks.Where's the innovation?"
3,This cd could have been HUGE if ...,"1. William Orbit had composed some original pieces of his own rather than remake a bunch of classical pieces.2. Had actually put rhythms and dance beats to the songs on this album.3. Composed a cd which constisted of the kind of music he did on Madonna's ""Ray of Light"" album and on his ""Strange Cargo"" series.4. Put some neat artwork on the cd and left his horrid face of the cover of the album!The music is nice to listen to for what it's worth but Orbit is capable of MUCH more than this! Get his previous works and you'll see for yourself. After the height of his success with Madonna's album, this was his chance to really make it big and he completely blew it! What a shame..."
1,A big dissappoinment,"This album should be called, tunes that you recognize played a cheap keyboard. None of the tracks are very exciting and most just sound cheap and tacky."
5,It works,This is one of the few products that actually works. I have tried others. Don't expect it to work major miracles though. Sometimes you can't fix what is broken.
3,On target,"New Product (as advertised), a bit pricey, delivered in perfect condition a bit ahead of schedule. I will continue to look for a better price but, failing that, I will purchase from this vendor again."
5,Extraordinary,"I have the vinyl and could not wait to receive the CD. I bought the orignial album in 1967. The live performances are memorable and demonstrate the power and range of Patti LaBelle and the mellow harmonies of the Bluebelles. In addition, her treatment of some of classic ballads, especially ""Danny Boy"" and ""Down the Aisle"" is always current and fresh. This album is a must for both ""old school"" and ""new school"" Patti LaBelle fans who really want to hear her take it over the top."
4,No complaints,The book arrived in the time frame it was supposed to and in the condition they said it would be in.
4,Foreyt,"Very handy reference manual for egg identification, but would be even better if it contained pictures of larvae and adults."
2,Rather disappointed,"Although I may be able to use some of these images for smaller craft projects, the pixel density and overall quality is horrible. For me, the selection of images was disappointing, but it depends on individual interests. As usual, the CD was very easy to use. I've purchased other Dover items and it can be a real mixed bag. If only there were some way to ""preview"" a few images to see the quality in advance."
5,Scrapbookers Full-Color Treasure Chest,I was very impressed with the book and cd i received. the book has fantastic color pictures and the cd is very easy to navigate.Sharon L.
2,Only Good If You Like Very Old Images,"I bought this with the hope I could use it to make a scrapbook for my daughter's wedding. All the images are Victorian era. My daughter will not like them because they are not hip and modern. If your project could utilize Victorian era stuff then go ahead and buy it. If you want more modern 21st century imagery, you should look elsewhere."
3,Good Fusion and Flashy Guitar,"This is a good fusion album, with lots of simple back-beat drumming, great bass work and scorching single-note runs from guitarist John Goodsall. There is a bit of repetition on many of the cuts, but as a whole I enjoyed it.I really enjoyed the first four tracks, the seventh one and I loved the ninth one, ""Operation Hearts and Minds"", which is worth the admission alone."
3,a bit of a disappointment!,"As a long time Brand X fan I was really psyched to see a new offering. It was a bit disappointing - not a bad record, but kind of flat and repetitive. Uninspired and not worthy of comparison with the Brand X we knew! If you only buy one Brand X CD to replace the vinyl, make it ""The Plot Thins"" - it is a good retrospective. Better yet buy all the original discs - they are all worth it!!"
3,Good Story...Not a Martial Arts movie,"I bought this movie expecting a Jackie Chan Martial Arts movie...and was incredibly disappointed. What I got was a desent story about a boy who is having difficulties in life and daydreams about becoming Jackie Chan's deciple. We runs away to persue this dream and runs into problems along the way.All in all... the story was good, the dubbing was horrible, the action was ok, the acting was sub par, and Jackie Chan played himself while not doing much fighting. The movie does send a good message, even with it being in Chinese."
1,Felt manipulated,"The description and DVD picture make you think Jackie Chan is a main character of this movie well he is NOT. He has a few cameo appearances. This movie was boring and lame. I felt betrayed in a sense. I bought the movie because of Jackie Chan but all it was, was an advertisement about how great he is. The movie is about a slacker, disrespectful kid who is obsessed about Jackie and scrambles all over wanting to be his disciple. He goes on and on about Jackie his hero. Lame lame lame! Buy another movie, this one will leave you disappointed!"
1,Sucked,"I rented this movie, expecting the normal Jackie Chan helping of humour and action. It is not. It is a poorly put together flick about a geeky kid with a few shots of Jackie. Don't buy it or rent it."
1,Rip Off,I've never bought a movie and felt so ripped off. Jackie Chan is in this movie for about 5 minutes. It's shot like a high school film project. I wish I could give it zero stars.
1,Not a Jackie Chan film!,"it's easy to think that this is a Jackie Chan film, with the picture of Jackie Chan right there on the cover AND the title of 'Jackie Chan Kung Fu Master', but this is NOT a JC film! Infact, JC is not the star of this film, and actually only appears a few times for a total screen time of no more than several minutes.This film is about some geek who is a fan of Jackie Chan and wants to learn kung fu from him, and he argues with his grandma and gets beat up by punks and stuff. The plot was so boring, my roomate started watching this movie with me but she got up and left less than a quarter into the film because she was so bored. I'm surprised I actually managed to stick through the whole thing, but to be honest, I was also on my laptop because I just couldn't give the film 100 percent of my focus. The cover and title for this movie is one of the most misleading I have EVER seen. If you are a fan of Jackie Chan, do NOT get this film."
1,RIPPED OFF!,"I never rate any movie in my life, but I feel like it's my obligation to warn the public about this movie. This is the worst movie I've watched in my life. It doesn't deserve even one star (but sadly I have to put at least one star due to the default rating system)The cover with Jackie Chan is misleading because he only showed for 5 mins. I rented this from the redbox and that is 1 dollar wasted! (and my time wasted)"
4,All the reviews are kind of right...,"This novel is for sci-fi fans who like super-fast character-driven plots with soft-science. The aliens are from Star Trek, the ships are from Star Wars and the science is pure fantasy. But if you like that kind of thing this is for you. If you want hard science fiction or James White medical sci-fi, this is NOT for you."
2,Should have been in the Harlequin Romances,"The book has the plot of a Victorian Romance AND is almost crippled by ""political correctness""... The poor heroine runs away from her cold guardian, where everyone loves her except for an obnoxious (and ugly!) rival doctor (male, of course!). She is rescued by an alien crew that loves her so much that they start a war with the evil goons of the chauvinist racist Earth Empire--led by her evil guardian. Before that she saves the planet from an intelligent plague (self-aware viruses),midwifes a pregnant galactic pirate-slaver, and charms everyone she meets...For a self-reliant strong heroine she spends the entire book being saved by adoring fans while she wrings her hands and declaims her complete unworthiness... Give this one a pass!Go read a Bujold book instead!"
1,Horrible,"Easily one of the worst books I have started to read in the last few years. So cliche, predictable, cheesy. Avoid."
5,Get Real,"Reading this book was fun and I couldn't put it down until I was finished. Its written in first person which is unusual but very realistic, it felt like I was right there in the story. I also liked the main character Cherijo Grey Veil. I work in a hospital so I can tell the writer has alot of medical knowledge from how she writes about surgeons and patients. She's also very, very funny. If you like medical adventure and surprises in the books you read then buy this one, you won't be disappointed."
3,Not a Romance Novel,"Cherijo Grey Veil is an interesting character, I decided to buy this novel after reading the excerpt at the end of Catherine Coulter's book, The Courtship, which I enjoyed. The excerpt is one of two love scenes in the entire 394 pages of the book. Two minor love scenes and one violent rape scene do not, in my estimation, describe a romance story. The majority of the novel consists of descriptions of the various ""innards"" of the many different aliens. Don't get me wrong, the story is interesting, I might even be tempted to buy the second novel in the series. But I will know that it is not a romance novel like Jayne Castle or Nora Roberts or even Dara Joy. My only concern about the next book is that Cherijo Grey Veil will end up with that slimey, unemotional, insulting, translator/rapist, Reever. THAT would be a big tragedy."
5,A keeper...,"I'm not good at writing reviews. When I read something I like, I keep it. If I don't like it, it finds a new home, hopefully far from me and never to return. This one I liked very much. I'm looking forward to the rest of the series and seeing where it goes from here. I recommend this to everyone and hope they enjoy."
3,"Not best ever, but good.","This book had a slow start but finally picked up speed and evolved into a good mindless read. Not as good as works by some of the better SF authors (Orson Scott Card for example) but an interesting, entertaining and lighthearted read. I look forward to the rest of the series."
4,Fast and Entertaining,"Stardoc is fun and entertaining. Nice mix of action with a little romance. I did not realize it was part of a series until I got to the end. This book was hard to put down, but the next few books in the series move even faster."
4,An Enjoyable Read,"I enjoyed this science fiction novel of a misfit doctor; Viehl has a good sense of pacing, a firm grip on dialog, and a fine ability in developing her characters. Although I expected a story similar to one of James White's enjoyable Sector General series, I was pleasantly surprised. Viehl's novel has the medical setting, but her style and plot are different from White's. Anyone who likes the science fiction sub-genre of future medicine should welcome another fine addition to this field."
5,truely practical,"this book is great it doesn't spend alot of time on the ethics and history of magick but gets right into some very usable spells, and gives both a Christian and Pagan variation on each so everyone can use it."
4,In Response to some of the reviews,"Actually, in contention to most other writers and the mish mosh of junk written, black candles are NOT for protection. They are used to absorb negativity..not to protect...but to be able to use that negativity in other instances such as Controlling, Domination, Dume, Hexing, Cursing, Reversals, etc. Buckland's inclusion of the polarity virtues of magick are a refreshing change from the cotton candy fluff now written."
4,Not a Bad Book!,"To the reader from NEW CARLISLE, OH: You can't just pick up a book on Wicca and expect everything to work. If you had read another book on beginning Wicca you would understand that Wicca is a religion and takes a lot of work and practice. Even then sometimes your rituals don't work. If the divine intended something to happen, then It would happen. This is a pretty good book, but it is kind of dull and boring. A good reference, though. PS: It's not the authors fault your rituals didn't work, it's your own!"
2,Don't waste your money.,"Although the spells are fair, this is a book with very little substance. Buckland packages Psalms with a few quickie-spell words of his own. There is very little here that other authors on magic haven't done 100 times better.Try Spells and How They Work (Farrar & Farrar) or Real Magic (Bonewits) or Living Wicca (Cunningham) if you want the real thing."
1,also very disapointed,"I do agree with the negative reviews on here.I was in such a rush to buy it and just saw the llewellyn insignia and didn't bother to read the comments as i usually do. If i could return this book i would.Very disappointing. Rituals and spells are winded and long with far too much to say during them.And the Christian section just rubs me the wrong way.It's soooooooo contrary to Christianity that, that alone for the respect of that religion should not be included.I believe in freedom of belief and worship, pray to the god you choose, or the one that has chosen you... but i still believe it is fundamentally wrong to mix paganism and Christianity in any shape or form.They just don't mix.So... save your money and don't get this book I was highly disappointed.As for the comment about the spells not working... there are very very many wide ranged explanations for that.Magic is not a quick fix, for anything. And it pains me to see that people just don't get it."
5,this book is phat for begginers,this is a grat book for any beginner intrested in magick and could be also just as informative for the more advanced i encourage people to try this book out i'm sure it'll satisfy your needs+i would like to add im sick of those people from us or whatever thy're called tryin to interfere with others and the way they choose to believe i respect your opinions and don't take it personaly but keep your views to yourself how can one judge if they do not know what they are judging.thanks.peace
3,A good place to start once you've done your basics,"and decided on the type of magic you would like to work. For those that work with fire, this is a good place to advance."
3,Not sure,"I purchased this book a few years back and had no results using this book at all. I did not of course use every spell in the book as not every spell applied. However, this was a few years back before I had tunned my skills. Perhaps I should have did an uncrossing spell first before attempting the spells? Who knows, I unfortunately just tossed the book and moved on.I would suggest to other readers to try an uncrossing spell first: especially if your not having success with the spells. Does this book work? Who knows but its worth a try especially if you've already bought the book!"
3,A Classic of Modern Occult Literature,"Practical Candleburning Rituals is a comprehensive look at the practice of Candle Magick outlining the method and the symbolism employed to work spells by using combinations and arrangements of coloured candles. A basic text suited equally to the Neophyte and to the Adept, Buckland's classic book takes the reader through all of the steps to developing their own style of Candle Magick.A must for every student of Magick and Occultism."
4,Good book,"I have read better, but this one has many rituals from which to alter to my specific needs. Candles of every color used"
2,PRACTICAL CANDLE BURNING.,NOT AS SIMPLE AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. DIDNT LIKE AND WOULDNT RECOMENT IT TO ANYONE. HAVE TO LOOK FOR A MORE SIMPLE ONE.
4,Nevermind the Reunion - Here's Sid Vicious,"Pure energy! I would have rated the alblum with five stars but the recording is not as good as it could have been. It's not terrible but it could have been better. I guess the venue (Max's Kansas City) probably didn't have the best acoustics for a live recording. Maybe the recording equipment was poor. Reguardless, this alblum is red hot. I would highly reccommend it to any Sid fan or anyone really. Well worth the money."
2,Sid Vicious,"The quality is absolutely horrific,but other then that,it was ah,not that good.Sid does have a nice voice but he sings less then half of the majority of these songs,messes up the words,etc.I can't really blame the guy because of this situation he was in at the time,but I'm reviewing the cd,not him."
2,my version is much better,I saw 4 or 5 of the 8 shows Sid played at Max's Kansas City in September of 1978. I recorded the Sept 7 and Sept 28 shows and my recordings are much better than this one.
5,great tape :) worked perfect,I installed my trim pieces in 50 degree weather which is kinda cold and this tape stuck amazing :) 3m ftw!
5,Excellent Book,"I personally found this book to be very informative. I've been seeking a way to blend the Runes with Western Ritual Magick for a long time. This book does just that. It also gives detailed information about the Havamal, including the much sought after spells mentioned in that text. I'd reccomend this to anyone interested in the Runes."
4,Mix man abandoning their customer base.,With the new release o fthe mixman studio product and having it only work on specific operating systems and the lack of support for the previous customers and the established customer base is a fault for this company.
3,I give it a 3 1/2 stars,"This is my second Balogh novel. My first was More than A Mistress which I thoroughly enjoyed, although it had a bit of a slow beginning. It was a good read. My only complaint is that Ms. Balogh spent too much time introducing too many names instead of focusing more on the relationships of some of the key characters (i.e. Jerome and Freydka). Lauren and Kit were an example of two souls complementing each other instead of being too much alike. Like the saying goes: Opposites attract!"
3,a summer that could have been better,this book was a bit slow for me till the middlethen it starts toget there it was a good read it could of used more sizzle i like the ending i decided to read the series.
3,Could have been a great romance...,"This book could have been a great romance. It had all the ingredients: a woman who needed to be awakened both emotionally and physically and a man whose devil-may-care attitude hid a deep soul and past pain. In the end, I was disappointed. It was ok, but only ok. Mary Balogh is an author who can do (and has done) much better.I often didn't quite understand what the hero saw in the heroine - why did he think her primness was cute? How was he able to continually shrug off her set-downs? As a hero, he was very likeable and dashing; I did understand what she saw in him. I didn't feel a lot of passion between the two of them.The frustrating thing was that there were opportunities for the characters to delve deeper and to really connect, but I didn't feel like that step was taken. Ultimately, this book is not a keeper in my collection."
3,I apologize to all Mary Balogh's fans out there...,"But I just cannot click with her particular style. Yes, this book was a decent read. The characters were definitely well-developed and I liked the change of pace of having a distant and seemingly cold heroine. But that is where my enjoyment of this book ended.This was definitely my last Balogh novel. I have tried to read several of her books-while I always enjoy the plot and character development, the romance part just fizzles. There is such a lack of passion and sensuality in her books. These are G-rated books...I guess you could say I prefer something with a little more spice. :) The sex scenes are dull and don't contain any sort of variance or heart-pounding excitement.This book is for those romance fans who prefer mild, G-rated, almost pure love stories. If you're looking for a really great read, try Kinley Macgregor or Nicole Jordan."
2,SLOW...NO PASSION at all!,"This novel is slow and dull especially the first 3rd of the book. The heroine is cold and prudish...almost impossible to like. The hero is not very notable...just the typical rake. It was very hard to continuing reading after the first 50 pages of the truly unlikable and cold heroine. The rest of the story is lackluster...they have a dull courtship, make dull love, and a dull ending...even in the novel the characters feel like they lack the all consuming passion that makes a good novel!!"
2,A Summer to Remember - NOT!,"Disappointing after ""NO Man's Mistress""! An ice maiden and a rakehell who turns out to be an ""angst-ridden man"". I read the entire book from 11 am till 7 pm. I am glad I had the library's copy and didn't have to pay for it! Too much hype and not enough susbstance. Lauren Edgeworth meets Kit Butler. Two opposites! She agrees to pose as his betrothed - why? You ask? So did I! She submits. Why? You ask? So did I! Sigh. D+U+L+L!"
3,A Summer to Remember,"I have really enjoyed Mary Balogh's books. This book was missing a lot of the humour that is found in so many of her novels. This said, I still found this book very enjoyable. The characters were very likeable and their development was thoroughly explored. I did find it a little repetitive when it came to how Lauren came to be her uppity self. Kit and Lauren's romance was slow to bloom and passion eventually came along with it."
3,It's Got Flots Power!,"Well, First off, it's not as good as High. But what is? Really? So here we are with a new album, and a bit of a new direction. If people thought High was too much thrashier than its predecessor, than this one will dissapoint. Most of the songs are VERY heavy, like a mix of Anthrax and Prong, with decidedly less Megadeth influence. They all kinda sound alike too, but that's not so bad, since it's got a nice vibe to it. The only exceptions are F***ers which is slow, and insanely heavy, and Falling, which seriously ought to be destroyed. So even though the songwriting and lyrics have taken a dip (""Win Lose or Dead?"" Seriously...) it's still good driving music. I like it."
1,This album is the most uninspired Flotsam record ever,"Unnatural Selection doesn't touch their previous efforts like Cuatro, Drift or When the storm Comes Down. It seems that with the leaving of Kelly Smith and Edward Carlton, the inspired songwriting is gone as well. It is a real shame because Eric A.K. is one of the best metal vocalists period. However,a bad song with good vocals is still a bad song. This record primarily lacks the originality that most of us flotsam fans have come to expect over the last decade. The guitar solos are amateur and the guitar arrangements are weak. I hope its only a temporary departure from the quality of their last 5 records."
2,Not their best stuff,"I never really understood why F&J never get the recognition they deserve. They have got to be one of the most underrated bands around. This cd is not the greatest they have created. It definitely lacks the heavy grooves from their previous efforts of ""No Place For Disgrace"" and ""When The Storm Comes Down."" It appears to me they were trying to capture a power metal sound on ""Unnatural selection."" If you are new to F&J, get ""No Place For Disgrace"", ""When The Storm Comes Down,"" ""cuatro"", ""Drift'"" or ""High."" All these cds shows what kind of awesome music can be created."
2,Worst Flots album yet...,"Wow. I can't believe how disappointed I was to finally hear this record. The new drummer isn't bad, but the band and new guitarist were trying for something a little TOO different, and didn't succeed. I miss songs like ""I Live, You Die"", ""Blindside"" and ""Monster"". Bring back the heavy groove, guys."
5,Unaturally Noticed,hAVING BEEN A FAN OF METAL SINCE I WAS A YOUNG TEENAger this was one i was looking forward to hearing my fav songs are promise keepers and chemical noose a decent cd especially considering the music that was out at that time i would reccomend this to any true hangbanger
1,Another average flotsam album,This is another 90's below average metal album from jetsam. This band has never produced anything stellar with or without the hack newsted. Maybe he will rejoin Flot now that metallica has a far better bassist.
5,Bass gone wild,"This cd hs my truck jumping up and down the road. I only have 2 subs and you can here this playing a block away (and still sounds good!). It makes the nabors call me(but they say ""that's a good cd where can I get it?""). I hope you buy this cd, it's a BLAST!"
3,Light weight quality,This watch chain is quite fine and light weight. I was looking for a chunkier chain for my husband's large pocket watch and this did not fulfill my expectations. The closeup photo makes the links look larger than they really are. I returned the watch chain.
2,Couldn't make it all the way through,"I bought this book while working through our first adoption. We were struggling with deciding between the different types of domestic adoptions. I thought this book would give some insight. I have to say, it was challenging to get through. I actually could not finish the book. It seemed wordy to me and did not come to any clear points - in the parts that I read anyway. I believe there are better organized, more fact-based books out there for those interested in learning about the pros and cons about the different types of domestic adoptions."
5,Should be required reading for birth and adoptive parents,"Finally people are beginning to realize that adoption doesn't end for the birthmother when she signs the relinquishment papers, or for the adoptive parents when the court papers are signed, and certainly not for the adoptee. It's a lifelong adjustment that brings unique issues to all the members. A welcome change for those of us who had to survive the era when everyone thought the best way to handle adoption was to keep secrets and tell lies."
1,USSR Ministry of Propaganda $ at work,"Mr. Gorodetsky tender amd loving relationship with USSR Ministry of propaganda is well know, just as his lack of reputation in professional circles. USSR is no more but the these people are their agenda to hide the reall history of WW2 remains. Why pay them and their lackeys your hard earned cash? They would be better spent on buying Suvorov books who got death penalty for writing them."
1,Very Slow Printing Using Wireless. Will not work with a MAC,"I have a multi-PC and MAC environment. After working with the device for hours, and hours - the MAC will not print to it. The user interface and configuration is all very poor, and not designed for non-experts. Even experts will find this little box quite frustrating."
1,WPS54G Linksys wireless printserver is indeed crap,"Bought this server because I already had a Linksys network set up with both a Linux box and a PC Windows XP laptop. Was able to set things up, even with WEP, but nothing would print to my OfficeJet G85xi, though I can print directly to it when connected directly to the PC. The print server would send test pages and claim success, but nothing came out of the printer....some lights did flash though on the server. After hours of talking to somone on Delhi, India, I was informed that it doesn't work with multiple-capable printers (e.g., combination fax, copier, printer, etc.). What a joke!"
2,Got 128-Bit WEP to work well,"Okay, I got this monster to work after 3 hours. Compare that with 5 minutes for a new wireless laptop earlier in the evening and that I have 8 years desktop support experience for a Fortune 50 company and you'll realize how steep is the learning curve. And yes, I've set-up wireless networks before.Some notes in my attempt:1) Always, always unplug and re-plug in the print server power just before you want to test your latest saved setting change. Why? I have no idea, it just works.2) Use the included network cable for the initial configuration. It was balking when I was using a long cable I know is good.3) Get it to print through the network cable first. You'll thank yourself when you are trying to get the wireless to work later.4) Match every wireless setting in your print server to your wireless hub. It can be done, the menus just don't make it intuitive.Good luck!(Windows XP SP2, HP LaserJet 6P with USB to parallel cable, D-Link DI-524 router)"
1,Horrible,"I have two computer science degrees. I can't get the print server to work reliably. Linksys Tech Support exists in name only.The Setup program is among the worst I have ever seen. I laughed out loud when I finally (!) finished the wireless config and the on-screen instructions told me to click the ""User Setup"" button to continue. There is, of course, no such button. It's Driver Setup. And don't get me started on the so-helpful error box that pops up and says ""Connect failed.""My Linksys Wireless G router is great -- too bad that Linksys' wireless client software and their support is so bad. Especially their support."
3,Make sure this is the one you need,"I'm rating it only 3 stars because because of Linksys. I received the product from the Amazon vendor quickly and thought it would be up and running in minutes. After almost 3 hours with Linksys tech support, they proclaimed it a ""firmware issue"" and had me return it to the vendor for replacement. I received the replacement only to encounter the same problem. After 2 more hours with Linksys tech support, I was told that since my printer would also scan, fax, and copy, I needed the WPSM54G for a multifunction printer. Don't know how I could have known that. I had researched the product on the Linksys site prior to ordering. Just didn't want anyone else to have to endure a tech support nightmare."
1,Buy at your own risk,"After several hours via online chat with technical support, I finally gave up. I have nothing against the technical support people as the product would have been installed if the hardware would work properly.Print server connectivity is unreliable making installation and print errors common. Never got it to work.Annoying things include the print server disappearing from the network. Resetting is not reliable either. Had to do a 30 second reset and unplugging and then 30 second reset.Even if you get it right you there is a 50-50 chance of detecting print server connectivity. Even after the installation, I still couldn't get it to work."
1,Junk!,"This device was the biggest pain in the neck, and after an hour of working away on it, it still does not work. I gave up and am going back to having a wired printer for the time being. Does not support WPA despite what Linksys says, and connectivity during setup would be laughable if not for the money I wasted on the product. This device is just one more reason why Linksys will never again be my first choice for networking hardware."
3,Not as easy as advertised,Was not able to get it to work with HP LaserJet 3055 Printer. Spent 2 hours with tech support until they finally told me to return the device. Also tried the WPSM54G and had the same result.
4,Got it to work with Vista,With help from Sherrie at Linksys online chat customer service we got this to work with Windows Vista. It was the the same work around that I used to get it to work with XP. Its a bit messy. Utility does not work well but printing is fine.
4,Pretty good only 1 small drawback,The print server is working great! The only drawback at all is that when you first install it you must hook it to the computer with a cable. When I think of wireless I think totally wireless. It was a pain but once I figured out that is how it had to be done things went very well. I would definitely recommend this product as a best buy for the price.
1,You're Kidding,I'm usually a big linksys supporter. This is an exception. This device is a joke. Not a very funny one. The first thing I was told when I called for support was it most likely wouldn't work with my printer (Canon MP950). I spent several hours trying to get a linksys router to see this thing with online support. Don't waste your time.
1,Linksys Quality Control: it doesn't exist,"Linksys admits that WPA does not work with this product and they have no ETA whatsoever for when it might work.I was suckered into buying the original 802.11g print server which didn't support WPA and never got a firmware update adding support. Then I see this new model has been released, so I call Linksys to get some details.Linksys has again shipped a product that is broken by design. WPA doesn't work at all."
1,Doesn't install on secure wireless network - or a wired one,"I got this because I have the Linksys DSL/wireless router combo and expected it to work. My router's set up to require a key to connect. I wouldn't expect the basic wireless print server setup to work with a secure wireless router, but the installation and the manufacturer web page contained no hint of what to do.My last-ditch attempt was to hook it up to the wired network. My PC still couldn't find the print server. I took it back and got my money back. Don't bother with this one."
4,Works well once I figured it out!,"The print server is a nice addition to my home office. I always had to go back to my PC to print. I followed directions but it still didn't work. Then I realized all three ports on the print server should have something in them but the picture in the directions didn't show that. Once I figured that out, I had to deal with drivers, etc. Now, I am usually somewhere else in the house with my laptop when I want to print and it is extremely convenient."
1,Hate this print server,"After 2 hours with Linksys help, they finally decided that this would not work with a B protocol router and I should either replace the router or just keep the ethernet cable connected to the router and print server. Doesn't exactly sound ""wireless"" to me. I am returning this print server and am DONE buying Linksys products."
1,Won't install on Windows 98SE - driver install requires dll function not in '98,"Despite what the package says, this server can not be used from a pc running win98. It installed fine and works great from my laptop and desktop running xp pro. The driver install calls a function in Kernel32.dll that doesn't exist in Win98, so the install fails and the printer driver can't be set up for the print server on a Win98 computer.This stuff isn't that complicated, I have bought many Linksys products in the past but the quality of their software, support, and hardware has declined steadily over the past few years.I recommend avoiding all Linksys products like the plague."
5,Works Great,"Setup was a breeze, print server works like a charm. Hooked it up to an Epson R200 printer, using a Linksys WRT54G version 2 router. Works perfectly for both wired and wireless PC's and laptops. My advice to those considering buying one, read the instructions. After the print server is configured, power cycle by unplugging it then plugging it back in. Install the printer drivers on the PC you want to configure, then install the print server drivers. Worked perfectly for me this way on multiple computers. Nice range, prints quickly, no worries. Good luck.Sgtnukem"
1,Does not support multifunction printers,"If you have a multifunction printer, i.e. one that prints, faxes and copies, there are apparently no Linksys drivers that will work for you. My primary complaint, though, is how can anyone be so inconsiderate as to put out a product without making this clear on the packaging? I had to call support in order to find it out.For those with single function printers, maybe it works fine, maybe not; I'll never know."
1,Warning: this device doesnt work with all printers,I configured the print server with no difficulty and it communicated with my Linksys router perfectly. Unfortunately it did not detect my Konica Minolta 2400W laser color printer. The USB light on the print server did not light. Linksys tech support sent me back to the store to exchange the print server because they thought it was defective. I exchanged the print server but it still will not detect the printer. Now Linksys confirms that their print servers do not work with all printers ... they also do not provide a list of printers which are compatible. Linksys should not release a product without warning that it doesn't work with all USB printers...or at least provide a list of compatible printers. This isn't about multifunction printers...the 2400W is a vanilla printer. Very disappointing!!!
2,Wait until linksys updates the firmware,"I got this product since Linksys finally released a print server supporting WPA. Despite spending over an hour on the phone with their tech support we could only get it working if I reset my router to match the factory defaults (including broadcasted SSID and no encryption at all). 30 minutes wait, one hour of struggle with offshore support, and still no action is enough trouble for me to look for competing products. Hopefully the first firmware upgrade will make it work as advertised since it runs my printer just fine when connected over Ethernet."
1,WPS54G is Garbage Linksys/Cisco Support is even worse,"Trying to perform a firware upgrade in the hopes that this $40 steaming pile will actually work, and Linksys can't even provide a working firmware."
1,"All promise, no payoff","Quite simply, it doesn't work. Ask to return it, and your only response is silence.Set-up was a chore, and requires you to precisely follow the instructions so specifically that most of your time is wasted. Then once I tried to connect to my wi-fi (encrypted) it wouldn't connect. The problem was NOT my wi-fi encryption, though. The setup program would not accept my WEP key.A massive waste of time and money. Couldn't be more disappointed in a product."
2,Not for Mac users,"I'm sure this is a wonderful product and my friend who bought it from me loves it on his pc based home network. Unfortunately, mine is entirely a Mac house and no matter what we tried, we couldn't get it to work with any of our computers or printers."
2,Typical Linksys,"I am currently on my second print server. The first one was always very hot, even if it was not being used. Well after a year it just stopped working. No lights nothing. The only reason I purchased another one was because all my other wireless products were Linksys. This time I attached a large heat sink to one side. This one runs much cooler. With all of the problems setting up my router, print server, range expander (all Linksys) I wish I had gone with another vendor. Now my range expander has stopped working after about a year and I assume it would be the same problem as the print server - heat. Oh well, this time I will switch to another brand and as my Linksys products die, I will replace them with their competitors brand. I am tired of customer service that can't speak English, setup instructions not written by English speaking employees and a total lack of knowledge of their own product."
1,Unacceptable for business; you're better off with a non-wireless one that WORKS,I'm not sure if this is a common thing with this model (I'd hope it isn't) but it seems to have an unlisted print queue of 8 documents. Aside from that its wireless ability is pretty useless because you'll likely rather plug it into a wireless hub/switch/router anyway.This'll be the last time our company buys a wireless print server; we've had better luck with wired-only ones(though I'll admit we're accustomed to more expensive HP JetDirect print servers)
1,The Tech Support issue,"I have talked numerous times with support center from India and Philippines. They were all trying to help, however, they do not know what causes the Print Server behaves that way. Every time I tried to print, it requires to unplug the power code to the print server. After printing, I try to PING the device, the system does not recognize the IP anymore. I have returned the item for the second time and no reponse regarding refund of my purchase. The support from remote help center for product and support from Amazon for customers seem to be equipped just for trival issues."
1,Not worth the effort,"This product does not work on multifunction printers, I can stand that. This was unfortunately the only answer that technical support could give me. They also indicated that using a simpler printer would make this item work without a problem. I changed out the printers and the print server would still not respond to the wireless, which is interesting because my wireless router log indicated that the server was connected.Two hours of frustration and I will move on to another solution, I do not in any way recommend this product.Side note: I did attempt to use the Linksys automatic setup from on the internet which indicated everything is OK on my system, even with this print server not working."
1,One star is too much,"In the last few years Linksys has been just a little fast in shipping new products to market. Too many times advertised features were not available until one (or several) firmware upgrades into the the product's life (it at all!). In the case of the WPS-54G it is obviously really still in a pre-beta stage of development.Without going into excruciating detail suffice it to say that all of the comments of the other reviewers are true. This print server simply doesn't work.I bought this as an impulse buy at a big box electronics store without doing my usual Amazon/internet homework. If I had seen these reviews first I would have never bought it.Do some research and look for a better solution than this product is right now. Maybe in a few months they'll come out with a firmware version that actually works, but right now all this is is an expensive and frustrating exercise in futility."
1,When will the madness end,"I must have some form of self-abuse disorder, as I continue to go back to the well with LinkSys and continue to be infuriated.Bought the wps54g, brought it home, unpacked it, plugged it in as instructed, installed the CD on my XP machine, and it did not find the device.Seriously, do they even test these things? There are not so many different devices out there from the 4-5 major manufacturers that they couldn't do it economically.Please, hold these guys accountable, do not buy this product."
1,piece of doo-doo,"If it doesn't work with multi-function printers, then why don't they say that on the box?? It didn't even work with my Epson C80 printer which isn't multifunction. The documention is non-existant and the setup program does anything but. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with some chick from India with an accent so thick I finally told her ""I'm sorry, but I just can't take this any more."" You couldn't give me another LinkSys print server."
1,Not Real Good,"I am a fan of Linksys products, but after this experience I am not so sure. I bought the Wireless Print Server, followed the instructions to a T and couldn't get it to work wireless. It worked fine with a ethernet cable, but what's the point of that? I consider myself a fairly Network savy person, but after an hour of tech support from some chap in India I had had enough. Returned for refund."
1,Whoops! Linksys Messes Up,"Yeah, I agree with the other 1 Stars here. I've never had a problem with any other Linksys product, but this is a piece of crap. It doesn't support WPA, can barely find my network when I turn encryption off, and generally is awful.Oh well, it's heading back to CompUSA."
4,WPA security IS supported - but hard to find how,"When installing the Print Server following the Quick Install Guide, the Print Server will not be detected on a wireless network when you are using WPA encryption.But there is a way to make things work:1) Temporary connect your Print Server with the network cable to your wireless router. You do not need to connect your printer yet to your Print Server.2) Install the Bi-Admin tool from your installation CD.3) In the Bi-Admin tool, you will be able to choose WPA security and enter your WPA key. When you click OK, these settings will be saved into permanent memory of the Print Server.4) Now you can disconnect your network cable from your Print Server. Than you connect your Print Server to your printer USB cable. Your Print Server will be found now in your wireless network.5) Now you click ""User Install"" to install the Windows Driver.Success!"
1,Warning Does not work with all printers,"After spending hours trying to get this to print, and searching their support site. I finally did a search on their forums for my printer. It turns out this server is incompatible with the HP Color Laserjet 3500 and 3600 series. I had everything else working fine, and managed to borrow a friends printer to prove it worked.Before you buy this server go to their support forums [...] and do a search for your printer and see if there are any issues with it. There is no list of compatible printers anywhere because there are only a handful that won't work with it."
4,Works as expected,"Straight forward installation. Would have taken me less than 20 minutes to set up if they had mentioned somewhere that the unit does not support WPA/AES encryption. So after a few hours of trial and error I finally got it to work by switching the router to WPA/TKIP. It's connected to an HP 6310 and functions without any problems. The client machine setup takes less than 5 minutes, as long as you have the required print driver installed.Both my wife and I use laptops and I really like the fact that I don't need to have a dedicated PC running 24/7 just to print once in a while."
1,Difficult to install and configure. It does not print.,"Two years ago I tried this printserver and it did not work. However with a little more understanding of wireless, home network using Linksys cable modem and router plus laptop and desktop computer and two Tivos, I naively thought I could provide wireless printing for the downstairs laptop. Nada! After numberous attempts to install/deinstall/configure I never got the first page of print. Save your $85."
3,Doesn't work out of the box.,"I have this little headache on an HP LaserJet 1012. The printer works fine in a mixed WinXP, Win98, and Mac OSX envorinment when connected directly to a Linksys Router. However, it but printed garbage when wireless for jobs sent from the Windows computers.About an hour with Linksys tech support, we got print jobs to work when we ***change the driver to a generic ""HP LaserJet"" driver***.Why there should be a difference when going wireless?? I dunno. I figure that if the computers send the right job when connected directly, and the printer receives and prints great, doesn't it sound like the problem is between the Linksys products when it messes up when I switch to wireless? Anyway, changing the driver worked. I'm going to keep it, but I could have been happier with the fix."
4,As expected.,"Produce arrived on time and is performing as expected. Fits my Toyota Camry '99. Overall, an average performance quality strut."
2,2.5 stars,"This is a halfway decent video but is tarnished by its overt Warren Commission bias, courtesy of CBS' Dan Rather. There is some nice vintage footage included, as well as some primary witnesses (such as Jean Hill). I wouldn't call this one essential but I would call it slick. I did like the inclusion of LBJ's comments to Walter Cronkite (that were banned by Johnson at the time) stating that others other than Oswald may have been involved.Vince Palamara"
4,works as advertised,Other reviews panned the product for being flimsy and of low quality.Although it is not built for rough use it seems satisfactory for me because I wouldn't abuse a camera anyway.
5,Great Device,It is very effective in blocking the sun from obscuring the camera image.It is easy to install and operate. It pops open for use with a simpletouch on the shield and easily closes or detaches for storage.
5,Delkin Pop-Up Shade--excellent product,"I have an older Sony Mavica that I put this shade on. It installs very easily and allows me to see the LCD screen MUCH more clearly in sunlight, or bright light. It's a great little invention, and well worth the $$$$ spent to purchase it."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"The idea certainly makes sense - but the execution is quite poor. The black plastic they use for the side and roof flaps are a glossy plastic. The screen protector - while welcome, is again glossy. All parts should be matte finish so as to not introduce even MORE glare. Completely useless."
5,GREAT STORY!,Ludell is a timeless book that every young girl should read. The book was in great shape and arrived on time.
4,whole lot of shakin goin on,"good book to read about these strange people. I did get a lot from it and it was indepth enough, while being short enough to feel I know more about the Shakers than I did before. No problems with this book"
3,"Great sounds, but not user-friendly","The user manual is poorly written. Also, when you record a song, any changes to the mixer or tracks for that song, makes the keyboard ""forget"" the tone settings of certain tracks. Very frustrating.The sounds offered by this keyboard are really nice, though."
5,Granpa Jones,This Guy Can Pick A Banjo. First Saw Him In He Haw backThe Day Hes Pretty Worthy A mis understood Genius.
2,Not safe,There are support rails on the bottom of this scooter instead of a plate. It has a bit lower of a ground clearance than other brands causing the rails to scrape the ground and become very sharp; sharp enough to slice my child after less than 3 weeks of use.Our razor brand scooter isn't effected at all in the same riding conditions after 4 years...something to consider besides color choice.
4,yay celtic music,"IF you like Celtic music, you'll enjoy this. It's not spectacular, but it's definitely soothing and well-done. The Thistle & Shamrock is an excellent radio show, and this is a good collection of songs that have been featured on it."
4,Best of the Thistle and Shamrock 1,This has been another great CD to add to my collection and appreciation of Celtic music. The narration throughoutthe CD helps add to my understanding of Celtic music and culture.
2,Frustrating and Corny,"It's hard to get past the corny ""humor"" and wacky Comic Sans font, but even when I do, the text itself frustrates. There must be a better way to initiate a musical novice into playing an instrument. I've yet to make it past the six notes in the first two chapters. Maybe it works for others, but definitely not for me."
3,Play Ball!,"This movie is a light hearted comedy, mixed with realism regarding segregation in this country. All the players did an excellent job in their roles."
4,comedy,"A realy good baseball flick,showing the way it was for player back in the days of color lines."
1,If erotica is a river this one is 1 inch deep a mile wide ..,"Sorry although I give it one star for the concept of the story the book itself was nothing more than a hump and bump bore....Mariella, young and definitely sexually active, is advised that before she can dig into the money bequethed to her by her father, a renowned astrologist in the UK, she must bed men from each and every one of the 13 zodiak signs. Poor girl ... to make matters worse, she has to do it during the signs month meaning shes stuck at this for a year ... otherwise ... I think she probably could have done it in a couple of weekends ...And, in effect that was the problem, the author lets us follow Mariella in her perfunctory task ... Even during a boring Shakespeare play, while most people would just go outside to smoke a cig, our heroine goes out and does the usher in a closet ...So if you want light and I MEAN light rerading you may enjoy it .. I'll give it a pass ...."
4,KATELAND,"ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW..Put this DVD in your player, and your TV screen will light up with beautiful colors. You have MANY colors to look at. Choose the color that best suits your mood. Looking at colors can do wonders for relaxation. Display your screen with colors. ITS ALOT OF FUN TOO."
3,Build Issue-bent front fork and bad bearings upon arrival,"We recieved this bike as a gift, it is really cute and pink is a big hit. However, the front fork and brake assembly were both bent upon arrival and the bearings sounded like gravel when turning the wheels. We decided to take it to a local bike shop to get fixed rather than hassle with shipping and returns. The bike shop said it looked like it was manufactured 'bent' since there was no cosmetic damage. There was no way the front tire would go on. It may turn out to be a good bike, we'll see after we get it back. Hopefully others will not receive defective goods."
1,Don't buy this product if you intend on using training wheels,Just as a couple of other respondents...Five minutes into the first ride and the training wheel bent out like Bambie's legs on ice and down goes a 4 y/o. It could be very dangerous.
5,16 in. by 20 in.!,"This platter is said to be 16 in., but that is only its width - it is 20 in. long! Very hefty and beautiful - I can picture a giant turkey on it for Thanksgiving!"
3,Good Watch!,"I received an update school logo watch which is good although I wanted the old log as shown. No problem there!The wrist band is a very good quality material but it was a little bit smaller for my taste. I think it was for a child's wrist. Anyway, I replaced it and is okay now."
4,90's space-rock...,"...with some (slight) industrial influence. This is really good, trippy, and flowing. The songs are tuneful, when they are songs, and the other stuff that is wierder adds dimension. A lot of it quite energetic in that old hypnotic Hawkwind way, with the guitars mixed load. Other pieces are more keyboard dominated. Their best yet--be sure to play it loud. I can't wait for the next one. Also be sure to check out their work with Nik Turner (Sphinx, Present or Future, etc.) and the side project Farflung."
3,Not for beginners,"Some great info on a wide variety of subjects. However, it is not a ""definite guide"" as the back covers leads us to believe. In fact, Foster tells us in his introduction that this book assumes the reader already has a solid grasp of kayaking basics. For example, in the section Launching and Landing the second method of launching is ""Rolling Under The Waves""! Not very practical for the novice. Probably a better text for the intermediate."
3,Too Short.,"The book is less than 100 pages long. The caption on the cover ""Secrets from the pro"" is much more accurate than the back's ""definitive guide"". The author definitely assumes quite a bit of experience and knowledge of kayaking. The book is more a ""quick tips and tricks"" for the experienced rather than a thorough guide for someone wanting to learn the subject.Might be a good book if you want to read the words of one of kayaking's royalty, but there are better books on the subject."
4,More great music,I enjoy Nelson Rangell's Cd's. I have a few of them & I thought this one was quite good.
5,Perfect for the Network+ Exam,"I just used this book and a few online tests and got an 833/900 on the exam. The book pretty much covers everything, just read it through a few times and take the practice tests and you should pass easily."
5,This THE tool to pass Network+,"I got 886 out of 900 and this is the book I used. Nuff said. The information is organized clearly, and systematically follows CompTIA's exam objectives Domain by Domain. On a side note, The Prep Logic CD's test is WAY harder than the real thing. If you get 72% on the Prep Logic test, you will definately ace the real thing."
3,Almost out of date.,"This book was for the 2005 exam. I took the 2007 exam within 2 weeks of getting this book and the exam cram 2 practice questions and passed. There were a few questions on the exam that weren't covered on these guides, but apparently it was enough to pass. When I took the test I was making consistently over 90 on all the practice exams. It would be good to have the practice questions book and a more up to date study guide with the updated questions. The general information is adequate but lacks in wireless and security specific information."
4,good enough if you have experience,"just got my network+ today. I used this book and some practice exams that i bought online. mostly I would say that if you know the topologies and media/connectors and TCP/IP suite, ports and all, then you will be ok. for the real test the part that could trip you up is the network support stuff that can be a bit confusing but as long as you have the other stuff down you'll be ok and that is basically what is in this book - the other stuff."
5,Great Book,"This book has enough to get you through the exam (I got an 820 out of 900 on the first try). The questions in the book are good, the preplogic questions on the CD are HORRIBLE so don't waste your time with them. I used measureup for additional questions which were great too. This books has the facts you need without the fat found in most other books."
4,Everything you need to the test with Typos,"Basically its everything you need for the test, broken down into eleven chapters with practice tests after each and two final tests at the end.The only problem is the typos. Come on guys, second edition.Sometimes its the incorrect answer to a question.Just make sure to mix this book with some free tests from someone else's site online."
4,Great buy,Seller delivered the book ahead of the estimated time and provided a bookmarker which was a simple touch to a beautiful transaction.
5,"Dont buy it alone, use as a follow up and to take with you to the test site and sit and read before test","I wouldn't say to only depend on this one for your Network+ test. But what I love about this book is that even after I read my other book that was more in detail, this one allowed me to refresh topics quickly and able to put my brain in the mind set needed for the test. I found it very useful to get quick snippets of topics on the go, and before the test. Highly recommend for that reason, but make sure you buy a more detail book to start with. I used TestOut's DVDs, another book, and this book to make sure I knew the content. Some had their pros and con's but when they are all put together you know the topic very well! You don't have to use the DVD's but my school let us check them out for the semester so it was nice supplement for the studies..."
4,Pass the test!,"I thought the book covered most of the material on the test, there werea few questions that wasn't covered but they may have been questions that weren't graded. Could have been more questions on the CD, there were only 50 question so I used the Exam Cram 2 Network+ Practice Questions book."
5,Excellect Last Minute Review,This book covers all subjects on the test. It was excellet to use for studying before the test. Keep in mind it is an examcram and not tutorial for those who have no experience networking.
5,This book delivers...,"If you are looking for a good book to study prior to taking the Network+ exam this is the one. I scored an 873 the first time. I read this book over and over and over in a 4 week period, made plenty of notes, highlighted pertinent info., and passed the test. I didn't bother using the cd-rom. Checked out maybe 2 or 3 of the questions and didn't bother with it again. I also went to techexam's website and tried there practice questions which also helped out and also bought TestPrep software from TechSkills which helped out too.If you are going to buy any book to prepare for the Network+, don't waste your money compiling a collection of books for the test. This is all you need. Also recommend TechSkill's testprep software. They give you an overkill of prep questions that do a great job of preparing you for the test. Don't waste your time with the cd-rom that comes with this book."
5,Good Enough for the Test,I read this cover to cover as my only study source and passed the exam. The practice tests that came with the book was actually harder than the test itself. Very worth while purchase.
1,What book did these guys read?,"I think that this book is total trash! There are so many mistakes in this book, and even more information that is needed for the exam that is missing. I used this book as my only material for studying for the exam, and I passed with the lowest possible passing score. To let everyone know, I do not have a lot of hands on networking experience. I have a bachelors in computer information systems, and have taken a few networking classes. The questions provided along with this book are a joke. If you are lucky about 10% of the questions on the exam will be as easy as the ones in this book. Several of the questions on the exam were never addressed in the book. An example of an actual test question would like: Out of the following fiber technologies, which technology uses a 2000nm beam? This is not the exact question, but its close. Good luck finding info anywhere near this in this book."
2,Mistake-ridden,"""Looking inside"" above shows you the old version of this book, not the N10-003 version. You might not notice that this book has been updated though. It tells you that there are 72 questions on the test and that you have to score a 664 (?) to pass. In reality (I just took the test yesterday (and passed)), there are 85 questions and you only need a 554 to pass.Some of the information supplied is contradictory, incorrect or not updated: the book only talks about Bluetooth v.1 at 720kps when v.2 is out and offers 2.45mbps. Other network+ books have this newer info.The most reliable and realistic part of this book is the MeasureUp CD. Don't expect to be able to find the answers to some of these test questions in the Exam Cram book though; they're not there.Bottom-line: You can probably pass the test with just this book, but you will run into questions mentioning things that are totally absent from the book. Spend your hard-earned dollars elsewhere."
2,Exam Cram2 N10-003 Network+,"I kust took the Network+ exam on 5-19-2008 and passed with a 607 out of 900 and you need a 554. The exam cram2 book for the N10-003 is not adequate enough to use as your only study material. They should update it completely to reflect what you will see on the test. Yes the book is easy to read and the practice questions are a bonus. Go to [...] to really get some extra practice on concepts just glazed over by these jokers. I do not recommend this book for a complete novice in the IT field, otherwise you can study the material and take educated guesses on the exam for material that this book does not even cover."
4,Alot but not enough,"There was some fine women in this video, but they could have shown more of those ""Luke where them girls at!"" girls. Overall though, very entertaining to the eye!"
3,So sad,I was sadly disappointed with this CD - looking for more soulful flute playing by Wheater. It has quite a bit of vocal which was unexpected from the sound clips - there is a female vocalist uuhhing and aahhing through the entire CD which makes it unbearable for me.
5,CD Incantation,Fantastic CD that I highly recommend for you all. The music moves you inside - just feel it <3It is music for different states of mind. Technical movements and soft ones. The balance on the cd is brilliant.
5,A must for anyone who feels victimized,"This is a brilliant book if you work under a person (or people) who make you feel that you can't do anything right. If you have worked for many years with very isolated or no problems at all and the bosses change, turning your working environment upside-down, using moral blackmail to ram you into a corner, read this and then decide if it is really YOU who's metamorphosized or if it's merely some 'special breed' of ego-trip boss who will eventually, with a bit of luck, make himself so unpopular he's sent off to a remote spot in Patagonia, at which point you can return to business as usual and feel like a normal person again."
3,Good value but has a few design issues,"This light has a great price point, can be direct wired to a dimmer, and has a nice satin nickel finish. Two installation/design challenges:1. the punch outs along the back edge for the wiring grommet conflict with the way the cover folds back into place. You may need to turn the retaining ring on the grommet to get the door to close.2. The rocker switch that comes installed in the unit is plastic and is only held in place by little plastic friction tabs. The wiring can force the switch to pop out so keep the wiring connections at the other end of the box.If you are installing new wiring as the kitchen is being build, be sure to leave at least 24"" from the face of the wall to get to the light and into the wiring box. Also, there are small black o-ring washers for the screws of the wiring box cover which are easily overlooked."
4,Good toy for child or adult,I purchased this toy for my 5 year old son. We worked together building each of the vehicles over 3 days. The remote control train is great but just going in a circle got boring. Wish there were more accessories to build for kids to build.
3,ONLY OKAY!,CUTE ORNAMENT - BUT THE PHOTO FRAME HAS A PLASTIC COVER AND IS HAZY LOOKING AND HARD TO FIT PICTURE.
5,It Rocks!!!,"It is a verry good book in ""The Herpetocultural Library"" series, it has lots of information, full color pictures and specific information on many species, it basically tells you everything you need to know to raise healthy and happy day geckos."
2,Monopoly Tycoon Boring,"It would be a much better game if 2 copies were purchased to play head-2-head.The computer players are way too easy to learn and beat, and to play online multiplayer you have to sign up with a pricey monthly service (considering the game date they may not even offer it anymore).It's really not much like monopoly, either.If you're looking for a monopoly game or a good stand alone game, keep looking. But if you have a home network it's not a bad game if you buy 2 copies and have some competition at home. I can see why it flopped on the retail rack."
1,Wouldn't work on my new computer,"I had this on my old computer and loved playing the game. Its a very interactive game, however, there haven't been any updates to the game since it was made. I purchased this for my new computer (old one died) and it won't install properly. I have a new computer with all bells and whistles but this game just wont install. I give up. Great game if you can get it installed and played on your computer."
4,brought me back,I remember this game when it came out and loved it. Graphics could be much better but it came out a long time ago. If you like simulation of old you'll like this game
5,parfume,"No problem...No problem with the parfume, the packaging ... I'm waiting to have more money to buy one another - thanks"
4,New creative light on tradtional Orthodox chants,"Far from being obscure feminist chants, Divine Rites is actually a unique adaptation of chants familiar to all Orthodox Christians. All the chants on this CD are still in use today, are explicitly Christian, and have always been chanted by men and women alike. This CD's most interesting addition to this musical tradition is the creative and expressive accompaniment and mixing of these enduring melodies, which are thus proven all the more timeless.Fadia El-Hage's beautiful voice is the perfect instrument to bring this treasure of the Orthodox to a wider audience."
3,MONTONOUS,"I listen to many c/ds everyday in my massage practice. Some c/d stand out and others do not. I thought this one was going to be one of those shining stars. I was greatly disapointed. The songs all sound the same after a while. The electric guitar on track 2 is completely out of place. I commonly skip that track altogether. I like the idea of this release and voice work is superb, but it does not hold up. I use it like a very rich dessert and listen to it once in a great while."
3,midlin' mildred,"If you're new to the Ms. Bailey avoid this collection. It's basically a compilation of live radio recordings. A better Bailey starter would be ""Thanks for the Memory"" (and it's cheap, too), and/or ""L'Art Vocal; Vol. 9"".For fans, this album is just fine, though a good third of its pleasure is nostalgia (not peak performance)."
3,Arthur Court,Ordered this item for a birthday basket for a family member that has an animal theme in one room... Was fine except one of the small shakers did not have holes drilled in the top... Had a small drill bit so did it myself... Otherwise item fine.
1,Dont waste your money.,Tried to send this item back due to not working. Received email from seller stating that it takes 4 hours to heat up. Give me a break. Guess they expect me to turn it on when i get home from work so my bed will be warm when i go to bed. Do not recommend for anyone. Complete piece of junk.
1,This thing doesn't work!!!,"This warmer is not warm!!! I had it warming for more than and hour! And it never got warm! So, what's the point of this warmer? I read somewhere that we have to leave for very long for it to get warm. I think by the time it gets warm my heater would we on already. So, useless!"
1,I picked the wong review to believe,There were two reviews that opposed each other. I should have swayed away from this product when i saw that. One said it was hot and the other said it was less than warm. I was hoping for the hot but got one that was barely warm. It was less than normal body temperature which would mean that it cools your body.I plugged it in for 2 hours and checked it every 15 minutes or so. I had to keep checking to see if it was plugged in and if the light was on. Saddly it was. It is useless to use. I am retuning it tomorrow.
4,Battlecreek #358 Delux Bed Warmer,"After trying many different options for warming my legs, I found the perfect answer with this bed warmer. It keeps the low level warmth at my legs, where I need it, rather than my upper body. My only complaint, why 4 stars rather than 5 stars, is that the control is wired into the cord so that I cannot have it at my bed side near my head. It must lay on the floor in the middle of the bed."
2,Smoking hot,"Wow. This thing is very hot. 60 watts is way too much, and there is no adjustment. I think about 15 watts would be much better. I recommend the deluxe model which has 2 settings, will return this one for that one."
1,"Inferior Product, beware!!!","I was very disappointed with this product. It doesn't get warm at all!!! Cover is not removable and is not washable!!! Cheap and not worth the money.Moreover, MedexSupply is terrible to work with on returns. Dealing with their customer service representatives was horrible. BUYER BEWARE ********************"""
2,doesn't last,"I was happy with this for a few months, until I saw that it was falling apart. Even though it had always been protected under a sheet, it wore out so that loose wires were flapping around. Not a comforting thought. If you're willing to consider it a disposable product, it's not bad. Inspect it closely every time you change the sheets, and plan on buying a new one after 3 - 4 months if you want to feel safe AND warm."
4,Good for the money,"All the poor reviews show me that they had a defective unit and should have sent it back. I've had none of those problems. I connected mine to the sound card of my PC and the video to a TV. It makes an excellent karaoke machine. I had to purchase a 'ground-loop isolator' from Radio Shack because I was getting a hum through the computer speakers and lines on the TV. The isolator fixed that problem. It wasn't a fault with the player.Update: 3/21/2011I sold the unit I was talking about above to a friend of mine and it still works great for him as a karaoke machine. I recently purchased another one for another friend who runs a karaoke venue and he is happy with it. It makes a great karaoke machine. Be advised that this is not a heavy duty top of the line player, but for the money it makes a great karaoke machine. I have never used it for DVDs or any other function. They were strictly used to play CD+G karaoke discs. For that it is excellent."
1,"DO NOT BUY, DEFECTIVE DESIGN will get distortion with mikes","I purchased a RJ Tech RJ-4200 from Newegg via this website, and it is highly defective. Even with high end mikes, there is distortion with the vocals, and any higher volume, even with extensive adjustment of the mike volume vs. unit volume the problem does not go away. I thought this was a deal at 69.99, but a Karaoke player that garbles the vocals is worth nothing. Avoid this unit and Newegg"
4,Affordable Karaoke Solution,"Although you can tell right away that it is a light weight, flimsy kind of product you would expect from its price range, the unit is versatile and plays pretty much any kind of commonly available karaoke formats. It works fine and provides a low cost solution to usual karaoke needs. The mics that come with the unit are usable. It beats no mic at all, just don't compare them to anything you pay real money for. It has some problems skipping sometimes when playing cheap VCDs but it works fine for all DVDs I tried. I've had it for only a couple of weeks and I can't say if it is built to last. For low cost products that would be my biggest concern."
4,Nice Karaoke Machine,"The Karaoke Machine is awesome. The sound is amazing. The two microphones provided are pretty good quality, but the microphone cords provided are terrible. Both of my mic cords had wires exposed and needed to be replaced after a week of use. The DVD's look good, but the sound quality of DVD's is not spectacular (just okay). Not as good as my other Sony DVD player in other words.Having the ability to easily move to particular song tracks immediately was a plus. Also, being able to easily control the echo/reverb is nice."
4,"Stone Tower delivers dark, eerie ambiance.","Although not the best Delerium CD I have ever heard, Stone Tower is quite effective in creating a dark and sinister ambient mood. In true Delerium style, half-heard voices echo across the speakers and there is the ocassional startling abrupt change in music so you're not lulled into only half-listening. I've found my reaction to Stone Tower different to that of other Delerium albums I have; while albums like Semantic Spaces and Karma are soothing and at times relaxing, Stone Tower is not, somewhat like the beginning of Spheres I, because there's an underlying sense of anxiety. Overall, it's not a great album to relax to, but it is fun, especially if you happen to be in a somewhat darker mood. Recommended for those who are already Delerium fans."
3,Lots Of Swimwear and Booty,"This video is not a movie it intreviews different african american models and is set in the Jamaica, Montego Bay Sunset Beach Resort. The movie showcases there beautiful bodies in some interesting poses. It lacks in creativity and could have had more girls but for the money it is worth it to see these models. In the nude some of them will make you want to go out and try to find them and make them your wife."
1,Remakes,"When dealing with Ray Price cd's, pay attention to the fact that he has re-recorded his greatest hits many times.This collection is a good example. All remakes, all well done, but remakes anyway.Usually most of the collections in the ""Hall of Fame"" series features remakes."
3,mixed emotions....,"I am a great admirer of Edward Burtynsky - and I will not hide my dissapointment with the book. I've seen an exibition ""Manufactured Landscapes"" twice, and have to say that reproductions in the album are of a poor quality, not to mention that at least in this particular case size does really matter...The album is good to have a general idea about the author, his work and his workshop (nice introduction, and interview with Edward Burtynsky - that's what I've missed from the exibitions) but if you haven't seen full-size prints before, do not buy this book - otherwise it might spoil your opinion about one of the best photographers ever..."
1,manufactured landscapes,the reproductions in the book were awful. i had seen his exhibition and purchased th e book because of it. the reproductions were not any where up to the originals. i am a photographer and the book is useless to me.ronald meyerson
4,Works well with modifications,I bought this because electric anchors have disappointed me with the quality and function (rope constsntly getting hung up in the spool). It required the purchase of a plate to extend it beyond the contours of my boat but that is just a design issue on the bow. I really like this product and believe it will do the job for years to come.
1,"Stuff looks good on roll, impossible to put on with good results!","I spent a lot of time to prepare the surface, a 24 x 24 flat white metal dishwasher face panel. It was next to impossible to cover the panel with this without a tremendous amount of air bubbles under the contact paper. Peeling up the paper to remove the bubbles created creases which were horrible. Three attempts wiped out the whole roll. Two and a half hours of my life I will not get back!"
2,Ok,"Not a true stainless steel look. Purchased this product to redo an old compact fridge and to cover the top of a kitchen cart that was ruined, This is a lot shinier than stainless steel appliances so if you are looking for an authentic look, this isn't it, but its ok for sprucing up something old or damaged."
1,Sounds easy....it's not!,Thought this would be a good affordable way to upgrade the looks of my kitchen.Even following everything in the directions. It will bubble bady and they don't work out. When you pull it off to try to readjust all the glue comes off of the stainless material. Cleaning it off is tough and I wound up messing up the paint underneath. I ordered a second one to try to cover up what all the damage I've done and it did the same thing. If the material were thicker it would work better.
1,To hard to apply,The roll was bent on the one end. I could use the rest but to many wrinkles when I tried to apply it. I have done this before with no problem so I'm not new to the applation. Couldn't use it at all.
1,Waste of time.,"Perhaps this book might have been more readable if presented as a children's picture book. At least with a picture book, there are images to distract from the sometimes boring writing. As it is, I think Mr. Diaz aimed a bit higher than his work merits, towards a mature audience."
5,A Journey Worth Takin',"Angela Weiler has chosen a perfect format to portray the various lives & perspectives of a cast of characters in a particular landscape (Maine in the 70s). She develops their portraits with humour, compassion, and great sensitivity to detail. This is a well-crafted and beautifully written book. I truly enjoyed the ride."
5,"Authentic speech from ""up the country"" enlivens characters","The author's dead-on depiction of her intriguing and fascinating array of characters is due in large part to her uncanny way with authentic, believable ""up country"" dialect and regional speech patterns. From the fourth-grader Michael Gonya to fat and sassy, cookie-loving neighbor Nora Gooding, the parade of memorable characters is unforgettable."
4,Psychedelic Music From Un-psychedelic Times,"A great and overlooked band from the eighties and early 90's, they eventually split into the very successful ambient techo group Astralasia, and the less successful psychedelic folk group Moonboot Oz. The is a compilation, a ""best of"" from those heady, exciting, early daze. Magic Mushroom Band slides easily from Middle Eastern, rave inspired guitar trance (Turban Paranoia) to spacy, west coast jazz rock (Hubbly Bubbly) to ambient excusions (Astralasia) and of course, trippy, acid drenched pop singles like ""Pictures in My Mind"" and ""Magick Eye"". There are a few weaker tracks, like the dated ambient dance piece ""Squatter in the House"" with its breathy female vocals, but overall, this is a strong collection of tunes from a great band that was unfortunately out of step with the times in which they existed. Excellent liner notes too, offering a slice of history and a rant against the fashion obsessed, over-indulgent 80's."
5,Hasnt Left the CD player,"In 3 weeks. I dont even have a favorite on this CD, it all blends so well, which should be difficult with the great deal of variety that is present. The more I listen the more I like it. Not a bad song in the lineup."
5,The TRUE story of Snnta Claus,"This is a story that you will read every year at Christmas! If you can you will read it to someone:if not to someone for yourself. It will remind you why ""you believe in Santa"".You will find yourself thinking that it MUST be all true. I have read this every year since the early 70s to a classroom of children. (Usally 6th Graders) They don't believe anymore, until after I read them this story, and once again they do!The story tells everything about Nicholas in a VERY believable way.If you can find this book I would recommend that you pay whatever it takes to get a copy! You will NOT be sorry!"
4,...Bruckman &...Coprophages are my favorite X-File episodes,Clyde Bruckman-I think that this episode brings new aspects to question in the show's thread. I was most pleased when Clyde Bruckman gives his prognostication of the two Agent's (Mulder and Scully) death. It leaves you wondering...once again...where the story is leading us. I would say that this is the episode that got me completely hooked on The X-Files. War of Coprophages-Is a great ice breaker for any hard core X-File fan. It has many great moments of comic releaf through-out the story. And it also spreads some light on both Agent Dana Kathren Scully and Agent Fox William Mulder's feelings. If you are looking for the X-File Mythology you will not find it here. This episode stands on its own creating a story that will spark your brain. END
5,A surreal nightmare,The story predates the series. It is a nice prequel with the exception of the addition of Dawn. Dawn muddies the mythology and the back story. However in this case it doesn't matter. The artwork is extraordinary. It should be framed. The demons are very creative. The stills take my breath away. Angel in his birthday suit doesn't hurt the eyes either. I love the use of poetry with the artwork. The monsters are real in the sense that we all have encountered them. The artists have given them form and personality. Perhaps they are easier to fight that way. Bravo!!!
4,A good read,"This book by Alexander deals with the subject of storm landings in the Pacific. Storm landings were a difficult operation in WWII and the author clearly demonstrates how difficult it was to put an amphibious force ashore, support it, supply it, all the while keeping the momentum of the offensive going. The book does leave the reader wanting more in terms of information on the specific battles it deals with. This was not the emphasis of the book but never the less much was left out when detailing the storm landings."
2,A Textbook Treatment of WWII Pacific Battles,"If you're looking for a detailed, factual analysis of the major Pacific amphibious battles in WWII, this is the book for you. If you're looking for something with ""personality"" or more of a human angle, there isn't much here. This is no ""Flags of our Fathers"", nor is it as accessible as the Time-Life books.This book has very few pictures, drawings or maps. I think more graphics would aid in envisioning what was going on."
5,Excellant Book,I loved this book. I got it from a friend and I was glued to it. It was about the battles from the Solomons up to Okinawa and even goes beyond to the planned invasion of Kyushu.It was written by Joe Alexander who spent 29 years as an assault amphibian officer for the Marine Corps.Great job Joe.
5,Excellent operational analysis,"This book is one of the absolutely best works ever written about the US Marine Corps amphibious operations in the Pacific during World War II. It contains a multitude of details and it was really a revelation to learn that the landings of 1943-45 were made mostly on amtracks and not on Higgins boats as the Hollywood movies imply. The chapter about Operation ""Olympic"" (which fortunately was never executed) is a real gem of professional analysis. This book is not ideal for the casual reader or someone who adores personal stories and first hand accounts but it surely is for the specialist and the military history buff."
5,Best Album I Ever Bought,"I bought it on vinyl in 1977 when it first came out, and 25 years later it still amazes me. I can't add much more than the other reviewers here, but I will add some info from the original liner notes that will interest some, but was not included with the CD:Chick Corea - Acoustic Piano, Fender Rhodes, Mini Moog, Clavinet, Moog 15, Polymoog, ARP Odessey, VocalsStanley Clarke - Electric Bass, Piccolo Bass, Acoustic Bass, VocalsGayle Moran - Hammond B3 Organ, Polymoog, Acoustic Piano, VocalsJoe Farrell - Tenor Sax, Soprano Sax, Flutes, PiccoloGerry Brown - DrumsJohn Thomas - Lead Trumpet and Flugel HornJames Tinsley - Trumpet and Piccolo TrumpetJim Pugh - Tenor TromboneHarrold Garrett - Tenor and Bass Trombone and Baritone Horn"
5,A nice surprise,"I read all the ""approach with caution"" notices about RTF's ""Musicmagic"", and after purchasing the cd, I was pleasantly surprised. Turns out, it's just Chick & Stanley pushing the envelope of sound a different way. No guitar; brass and vocals added. I would strike this as a combination of the 1972-73 RTF releases (Joe Farrell is back on this one), with a Miles Davis / latter-day 70's twist. A tip-top product."
5,"Insightful and Fun, Oracle of Love is a Great Find!","I've had the pleasure of using LeeAnn Richards' new book on a number of occasions. The Oracle of Love has proven to be a wonderful tool for myself and my girlfriends. It's incredibly easy to use. Richards offers several card spreads to choose from, so we've been able to tailor the book to our needs. Specific cards are siimple to find because of the easy-reference format used by the book. The advice given by the cards (via Richards' interpretation) has been amazingly insightful. In addition, the stories she tells both amuse and warm the heart. I would recommend this book to anyone who's looking to find out more about themselves and/or the person they're currently interested in. It's a real find."
2,I apologize in advance...,"I am a longtime FLA fan who recently started listening to Delirium. However, I've never been a huge fan of much of FLA's work prior to Tactical Neural Implant...or maybe even Virus. I enjoy it--but in a nostalgic sense, not because it is complex, lush, evocative music--it isn't. Morpheus is to Delirium as Convergence is to Frontline Assembly. Awful on the ears, but worth the effort if you want a glimpse back into early 90's industrial. I'd like to be more optimistic about this CD, but I can't be."
1,The bad apple,"save your money, don't buy this album. 80's were a painful time for such bands as this one, and this album reminds you oh so well that you should just forget their work from the 80's ever existed."
2,Extremely disappointing,"This book came highly recommended. ...On an even more fundamental level, though, the story just isn't compelling. There's no strong narrative, no suspense, and virtually no character development. Pelecanos is trying to to make some sort of misguided social statement..."
3,"Rather be ""At the Circus""",I loved the first two Strange/Quinn tales and had high hopes. Sorry to say this story never engaged me and I can't really recommend it. Time for GP to move on to a new venue and some new characters.
5,Top of the Game,"I come late as a fan of Pelecanos, and I can't believe I overlooked such a top notch writer. Characters, dialogue and setting all make this a noir mystery from the old school. Heroes aren't always heroes and the surprise ending is back. In Derek Strange and Terry Quinn Pelecanos has created a real life experience, men with souls, consciences and a sense of their own shortcomings. But that doesn't stop them from trying to do the right thing, make mistakes and move forward within the limits of their power. Not for the faint of heart or the reader with a false sense of right and wrong."
5,Excellent,"Soul Circus, George Pelecanos' third installment of the story of Derek Strange, the proud private detective in Washington DC is excellent. Pelecanos does not shy away from disturbing story lines and this novel is no exception. Strange and his partner Terry Quinn are caught, as they always are, in the middle of violence and drug dealing turf wars in Washington. The cast of characters is not pretty, nor is the action. You've got drug dealers, gun dealers, murderers, gang wars, etc. While the stories are disturbing, they are also entertaining. The background of the novel is filled with Pelecanos trademark soundtrack. The novel makes for a quick, gripping read. The one caveat I would give you is that Pelecanos gets a little preachy, through the characters, regarding gun control and the death penalty, but I do think his is an honest exploration of the ramifications of both of those hot potatoes. Enjoy."
4,Fun little toy,My 3 yr old son really likes this toy. We received it in a timely manner. Our only complaint is that the logs come off of the truck and are too hard for him to put back in...this may not be a problem as he gets older.
1,Dissatisfied Costumier,This product was not worth a star and it shouldn't have costed that much. I bought the item because I a mentally challenged child who really wanted a log truck for christmas and this was the only one I could find. But instead of getting a reasonable size one they sent a way to small toy that is a major choking hazard for any ages. How am I suppose to explain to him that I couldn't find him what he wanted. Just because your way to small toy I have to crush is heart. Thanks a lot for the toy that isn't what I was expected. To others that want this toy don't buy it cause its not worth the money for it. I am not gonna buy any more of your products because to me it was a rip off.
3,Too small,"I think this toy is really small and for this size it is overpriced. It is very light.M&D; log carrier is much bigger, it is wood too and the price is only a couple of dollars more.I wish I have bought that one.."
5,Owenvsv--truly a new home for mystery lovers,"Mystery lovers be warned: read the first page of Appalachian Twilight: Owenvsv and you will not be able to put the book down until you are done. A first rate university murder mystery, Appalachian Twilight takes readers into the heart of the southern Great Smoky Mountains. The best and worst of academe is to be found in these pages. The characterizations are well-drawn and frankly heart-warming. I enjoyed spending time with these people. The author promisees a second book and provides an opening chapter which promises more mysteries ahead for Peter Cooper and Josie McGuire. I can't wait."
5,wow,Emma's all grown up now. She's improved alot. I wasn't into the tune when I first heard it but it's got an infectious hook and you can't get it out of your head. It's a good tune. She sounds and looks great.
1,watch out,"i have an apple os x 1041. this drive cannot be read, whatever they say on their website. dont waste your time with iomega tech support. useless."
3,"Good, but salty.","I can't get the greek flavor to the food because it would be too salty. I combined it with other spices, but what's the sense if you can't use a lot?"
2,"Good but SALTY, SALTY, SALTY!!!!!","Very good seasoning blend, but sooooooooooooooooo salty!!! Way over the top salty for my tastes. And the salt free version uses something in place of the salt which seems to make it really bitter. Apparently no happy medium. Make your own greek seasoning, lots of recipes all over the web."
1,BEWARE! This contains MSG a dangerous neurotoxin!,"I bought this product and was very happy with it until I realized that it contains MSG a very dangerous neurotoxin. Please check this out before using it again, you may want to find something safer. [...]"
3,it's good but...,"The actual part itself is good but you have to remove the plate from the original and it comes with only 1 gasket. You need 2 gaskets (one on either side of plate)so not only do you have to reuse the plate but you also have to rob the original of 1 of the gaskets and if your original gaskets are bad, you're in trouble. The part needs to be linked to also purchasing an extra gasket just-in-case."
4,Dormain 698100 shift solenoid,"The solenoid works great. The shipment was slow until I upgraded to 2 day delivery, then I received it as expected. The product was not packed carefully, not have enough cushion, and the plastic cover connector was broken, but the part was still functionally fine, and I didn't have time to request for replacement."
5,DORMAN NOT!!,Smooth shifting.. better than off the show room floor BUT they sent me a Borg Werner not a Dorman solenoid I would cry bait and switch if I thought for one second that the Dorman part was actually better but in my opinion the Borg is the the more trusted name in transmission parts. No harm No foul!
4,Useful from basics and theory to practical examples and guid,"This book tells the would-be natural ventilation designer what s/he needs to know and how to do it. It is a compact presentation that captures the most important information for those who would reject mechanical ventilation or at least rely on it only rarely. It is very nicely illustrated and presents technical information in an easily understandable form. I recommend it to architects, engineers, and serious students of building technology."
4,Fun way to listen to music,"I got the Hannah Montana MP3 player and this clip. It works well. You have to be careful not to lose them, but my daughter who is 7 enjoys it."
3,These are great,"Hit clips are great for kids. It is easy to buy them the music you want them to hear, but it looks like those fancy expensive ipods that might be to much for many kids. I think this is a great alternative for kids to be cool without the expense."
4,Good Concert BR,Good Sound/Pic Quality. I don't like the music as much as her other BR (Oral Fixation) but it's pretty good. This one's geared more for the European audience as it seems to contain a more rock style than her usual Latin Flavor.
1,Shakira dvd,"Did not like dvd of Shakira, too wild for me ,cound not under stand lauguage. Would not recommend unless you r in the hip hop group."
2,Shakira's body-image change,"I have always considerd Shakira one of the better bodies in the music world; however, she has lost some weight arround the hips. This doesn't affect her singing voice; but, I had grown accustome to seeing those curves. As for the conert she put on, it was nice. The songs and back-up dancers where multi-curtural. She started as an artist speaking Spanish and English; and she has gone back to her roots. I'm not sure if a French word was given; but the music was good like always with Shakira. She is a ture humanatorian and I like her."
1,Impossible Review,"Dear,I can not respond to, because I have not received the product, the late date is closer to 10 days.cordially;Pablo Passaglia."
2,Did not know it's the OLD OLD version,"Oh well, I dont know if the description mentioned but it is the oldest version of Thomas. The cartoon is not animation. No wonder so cheap. :("
3,My kids love it,"I was disappointed that this is the old animation. (I think the clay figures--or are they wood?--look a little funny.) But both of my children really like it anyway and don't mind that it's not like the current show that they see on PBS. They kept asking to watch the episodes and were laughing through it. I wish the picture on the front of the DVD looked like the old animation though. I didn't exactly know what I was buying, I guess."
4,Nice but not English,"I bought this as a surprise Christmas Gift for my Wife. It arrived safely and with plenty of time for the holidays. She was Quite pleased with the Gift. I was somewhat disappointed that the Spode Platter was not manufactured in England as is the reputation for the Company. Stickered on the box was ""Made in China"". The manufacturing stamp on the bottom of the platter does not show the origin, but it does not say ""Made in England"" as are the other pieces in her collection. I did notice it mentioned ""made in England"" in the description on the amazon page. I removed a Star for it being made in China alone. The quality and printing appear fine."
5,It Works!,"Very practical. ""It works"" just about says it all. Installs easily with two screws. The arms with their ball ends holds the roll without the frequent falling off that I've experienced with the standard plastic holders from the supermarket. I have used this for most of a year and it stands up well. I expect it to outlast me because it is stainless steel."
4,"Looks Great, Works Well","I've had two of these mounted in different spots in my kitchen for the past 6 years, and am very pleased. While there are a couple stainless paper towel holders that look snazzier, they are more expensive so that's something you can consider. But we're a big family, and these are attractive enough and have worked flawlessly -- when you pull, you can easily snap the towel to get just one, or if you need a bunch you can pull more smoothly and get more. The roll has never pulled off the holder, and it isn't any trouble to pop a new roll on when the old one is finished. As best as I can tell, there hasn't been any ""wear"" or any loosening, it looks like it'll last for decades."
5,Smooth,Smooth rolling on this OXO towel dispense. Worked great at my last apartment. I just wish I had a place to mount in my new place.... but alas...
5,Great and Simple Device,"I really love this paper towel holder! The design is very simple. It would look nicer with a fancier metal finish, but that would change the price range entirely. The most important aspect is that it holds the paper towels with just enough force to make spinning of the roll easy, but also makes tearing off a piece without spinning the roll no problem."
1,Broke after a few months.,"I have had this paper towel holder for about a year. It was fine until one of the rubber ball tips broke off. The slit in the ball widened, and it falls off all the time. This was an annoyance, but I just put the ball back one. Now the second ball has fallen off as well, and unfortunately it got lost. I wonder why they didn't use some type of adhesive to keep the tips attached? Needless to say, I'm on Amazon shopping for a new paper towel holder."
1,Pretty but not practical,"This product matches our kitchen, but it doesn't hold the roll. When I go to pull off a sheet of paper towel I get multiple sheets, and usually the roll falls off."
2,"Works for awhile, then the rubber balls break","We had one of these for several months, not more than 12 months.Then the rubber balls failed to stay attached to the holder.We end up buying another brand paper towel holder, which has not held up well either.We are going to try the SimpleHuman brand... A friend has had one for the past 7 years w/o fail."
4,Almost perfect,"I've had mine for 5 years now and it does exactly what it's supposed to. The only problem I have is that the balls constantly come off when I'm switching the roll. I plan to put some gorilla glue in the ball and hope that it will expand enough to keep the balls from coming off in the future. Mine is mounted under the cabinet, which is great since I have very limited counter space."
1,Rubber ball end comes off...,"I bought this paper towel holder a few months back, and worked for a couple of weeks...maybe. Then one of the rubber ball ends fell off and now it constantly falls off after a few pulls of paper towel.Now I need to buy another one. Buyer beware this product."
4,Gets the job done,"I've owned one in the past, and it works well. It's not fancy, but holds the roll well and is unobtrusive in my kitchen."
4,Finally A Towel Holder that Works,"This towel holder works really well. Unlike the many holders on the market that bind and make pulling a sheet off the roll difficult, this holder allows the sheets to roll off easily and smoothly. Easy to install, too. I bought two and glad I did. Forget about those cheap plastic ones. This one works."
3,"Book and series are great, movie fell short","Unfortunately they didn't follow the ""heart of the book"" the series is excellent, but the movie came up short. I understand the subtitles, but it did make it harder to follow. Would have like to see the true characters come out on the big screen"
2,unforgiveably dark photography,I too was taken in by Gary Oldman being in the picture. The photograpy was unforgiveably dark and annoying to me. Something was lost in translation because I found the story line hard to follow and turned it off after about half an hour.
3,Didn't fill my need,This is probably very useful for counselors working with developmentally disabled adults. It is less so for families trying to cope with one.I'd hoped for strategies to teach money management and independent living skills to a limited capability family member. This did not provide that for me.
1,This product does not fit as described,"I bought this shirt and the size chart said that an XX Large was an 18-18.5 neck. It was not. I received it, tried it on only to realize that the size was quite off. The neck was way too big. I called to see if I could exchange it and they said that I had to pay a restocking fee. So I did, and I paid for the postage. They never got back to me until I tried to contact them a week later through Amazon and they said that they would not exchange it because it was unpinned. I would not recommend this product because the size is not what they purport it to be and the exchange policy is unrealistic. Also, the seller is very unwilling to resolve the situation--they only offered to return my restocking fee and the shirt or get rid of the shirt and send me the restocking fee. In my opinion, this seller is not well equipped to sell products online as many buyers may have to exchange their products since they can't see the product in person and try it on."
1,faded,"The shirt fit very well and I liked the color. However, by the time I got around to wearning it, I noticed the color in the underarms was completely bleached out. It must have been a returned item and they just shipped it to me. Live and learn....check out items immedediately upon receipt so you can return them if needed."
3,Touch of Paradise Awning Stripe 300-thread count sheets,The sheets were not exactly the color pictured on the web site. The feel of the sheets were great and they are very comfortable to sleep on.
2,"An end to Metaphysics, indeed","Heidegger bends Neitzche to his purpose in this book. Great philosophers are often quilty of mis-interpreting, mis-reading, and maligning those who came before them, in order to introduce a distance between them, to highlight their difference.Heidegger does just this, and gives perhaps the worst reading of Nietzsche possible.A good book for understanding Heidegger - a poor book for understanding Nietzsche."
3,Very Experimental,"You can't have any expectations for this album based from Pig's later work, which is much more consistent in its uber-industrial brilliance. This album is an inventive, jazzy, funky, sporatic, soft-core version of Pig. And I say soft-core because it doesnt have the musical intensity of his later albums Sinsation, Wrecked, and Genuine American Monster. The original version of My Sanctuary on this album is extremely flimsy in its execution, very dissapointing after hearing the remake from Wrecked.Strong points in the album definitely are Gravy Train and Sweat and Sour, both showing the most musical sensability and closest to his later works. I do suggest this cd for anyone who is interested in hearing something unusual. If you've never heard Pig before, just understand, it only gets better."
4,Praise the Lard is simply unbelievable!!!!,"Watts again proves he is truly a musical genius on this album. Praise the Lard switches music genres within one beat. First, you think you're listening to what sounds like an orchestral symphonic movement and then it sucks you into this menacing rollercoaster stuffed with grinding guitars and sporadic horns...along with Raymond's deep growl of course. There are so many good songs on this album that it's hard to mention them all, but some stand out to me. I like Hog Love and Gravy Train, but the one song that most people never mention on this album that totally blows me away is Blood Slicked Highway! I cannot stress how much <PIG> RULES! If you buy any <PIG> album, do yourself a favor and buy this chunk of lard. Other albums may be harder to find, but Cleopatra recently re-released The Swining and Red Raw and Sore. Ohh yeah!! I have to get my hands on this! NIN is washed out. KMFDM is dead. The PIG will save us."
4,Industrial Overture,"i'm a big fan of Nine Inch Nails and this is definitely comparable. My Sanctuary and Gravy Train are very well thought out and interesting pieces. Sanctuary has a good dramatic build up to its thrashing industrial score and is my favorite. i would have given the album 5 stars, but some of the tracks are very much like stupid ska/swing type music. Still the quality of the other song should not be over-looked."
3,"Music -GREAT, design - BAD",If we rate the music - it deserves 5 stars. But what can we do with this terrible design? Cleopatra - you lose the game.
2,Great cream with odd side effects for me,"I have no clue why, when I use this hand cream, my soft contact lenses turn pink. Seriously, no meds in my system, no dietary changes, several different brands of contacts (I was working with my eye doctor to find a suitable pair IN their office. The lenses turned pink that fast) all turn pink within about 15 minutes of being in my eyes. This is the only variable. When I stopped using this cream, the contacts no longer turn pink. Odd and disturbing enough to make me not use the cream."
4,Was told about by a friend and now I'm a fan for life!,"I often get acrylic nails put on and the process ruins my nails. A friend told me about this product and I decided to give it a try. I absolutely love it. I use before I go to the nail salon or polish my nails on my own, and immediately can see and feel a difference. My rough cracked nails feel soft and much better right after use, and allows polish to go on smoothly. Plus it has a fresh clean scent. One downside about the product is it kinda leaves a filmy feel on your hands right after use, but its not a big deal."
3,"Amazing, but with one big problem","This stuff works great! I have brittle nails that are always breaking and splitting. After just a few days of using this cream, no more broken nails! BUT... The packaging is horrible, it broke in two right away and I had to transfer the cream into two containers. For that reason only I had to give it a 3 star."
4,Works Well,"I was skeptical about this product, because I didn't believe something could actually help your nails so much. I had worn acrylics for about three years, so nails were extremely thin and constantly breaking. This product makes my nails grow so quickly. I used it for two weeks and had a ton of growth and just to see what would happen, I didn't use it for the next two weeks and didn't have nearly the amount of growth. My nails are not as hard as I would like them to be, however; they are still in recovery from the years of nail abuse I put them through."
4,Good lotion,"It's good stuff ... if you're looking for top of the line, this isn't it, but it's perfect for intermittent use throughout the day, espescially if you don't like all that perfumed trendy stuff ... and the tube will fit easily in most any bag to carry with you."
4,collection,its a nice detailed character from the 70's cartoon version of the movie i will be placing this in a display form and though its not much now by tim my boys are my age should be a collector piece one from the 80's fetched 300 dollars
4,Passing Gas: And Others Towns on the American Highway,This was really interesting and not hard to read. Enjoyed the information and laughs.
5,You'll Laugh Until It Hurts,"I have this book on my family room coffee table and even though I've read it cover to cover at least twice now, I still get a big smile every time I see it there. Why, well how about the concept of God having a bar code check out lane on Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania? I've been down that road at night and after reading Gladstone's description of the PA Dept of Transportation's paint test area, I laughed until it hurt. It's great photography with writing that leaves you wanting to read and see more of the same."
2,Just horrible!,"These are not the Danner boots that I know and love. My dad has been buying these for a long time now, mostly because of the wonderful quality and the fact they WERE made in the USA. I also still have an old pair that I got back in high school that are just now wearing out (over 6 years of hard use)I think you might still be able to find a pair made in the USA, but none of these are! I tried these on at a local outdoor store and they are horrible. The fabric is very cheep and flimsy feeling (that's made in China for you). The hooks and eyelets for the shoe laces are made out of PLASTIC! Really Danner? These are a sorry excuse for boots in general, and especially for Danner. Look elsewhere people!"
2,Hard seem around ankle,"Felt great on the bottom of my feet but a hard seem on the tongue of the boot makes for a hard spot that rubs on each of the ankle bones (inside and out) on each foot. Every step hurts since these hard spots rub against your ankle. They look good, seem durable but I have to return them because every step hurts. Tried massaging those spots to soften them up and tried to get those blister protectors but it's no use. It's a a design issue. My 5+ year old Wolverines don't have this issue."
4,Great Book,"I saw the movie before reading the book and I thought the movie was pretty good. The book was just as good, although I thought the movie version was somewhat better. There were times that it got a bit tedious but overall I enjoyed it and I would definitely recommend this book to others."
1,"Stephen King 6: The Tommyknockers, Thinner, and the Bachman Books: 4 Early Novels","Book came and it was just a beat up copy of The Tommyknockers. Returned it, completely annoyed by the bait and switch."
1,Not worth buying,"This has to be one of the worst DVD's on Green Day. Its unauthorized, so most of the information is incorrect. If your a fan it's not even worth it, it's really just bunch of facts people already know and a bunch of fake information put together. Your better off buying something official than this piece of garbage."
1,Unauthorized!,"This is an UNAUTHORIZED documentary, which means there is NO Green Day music in it and they did not speak to the band. Clips of Billie Joe, Mike, and Tre are few and far between. It's mostly interviews with third parties, some of whom are idiots (and not in the good way!). I could only watch about 30 minutes of it before I couldn't take it anymore. Totally not worth it."
4,This is the second book you should buy,"Don't be surprised when you get a very small package from amazon! This is not a book, it is a two floppy disc set of unformatted ASCII text.I rated this book with four instead of five stars because I expect a top notch book to be edited - these are far from edited - miss spellings galoar, bad punkshuashun, impropper gramer, edsedera, edsedera.Iffin you think he is a college-edumacated writer - he's not, but he is a good mechanic and he knows where all the nuts and bolts go on this motor."
1,A Rap from a no TALENT BUM,"This guy has no right to release this album without letting anyone else listen to it. He did it for the money, why you ask? Because this one was released only 2 months after his last one. Save your money for something, not like he did."
4,I love the song ''My Nigga's'',"The first song makes this CD, even though it's only a skit, Howard Stern's version is very good to."
2,I LIKED THE DARK AND HELL IS HOT ONE BETTER!,WHAT THE HELL IS THIS CD SUPPOSED TO BE MAKING FUN OF BLACK PEOPLE THATS REALLY ALL HE TALKS ABOUT JUST A BUNCH OF CRAP IF YOU WANNA TALK TO ME ABOUT IT E-MAIL ME
1,DMX is a disgrace to tha rap game- a must no buy,"I listened to this at my friends house.... DMX is in it only for the money, not for tha luv.His lyrics are too original ,he has no dope hooks, and his voice makes him sound like he's 50. maybe then he will be mature enough to make a good rap album. 2 thums down."
5,#1 Rap Artist Today!,"Starting with ""My Niggas"" this album soars. After thetragic death of 2PAC and Biggy Smalls, DMX is the rap KING! Thoseother [fellas] can't come close!"
5,the cd is the bomb illest,"dmx second album was very good with his dope lyrics like it's all good, and the song with the lox, dragon and jay-z was hot on the album but he brought this album so fast after six months of his first album"
2,disappointing,"If his first album was the best rap CD of 98, his second release ""Flesh of..."" might be one of the worst rap CD of 98.... Truly disappointing performance from someone who was all ready to take over 2pac's position..."
5,it was the dopest CD i've ever owned it goes to all homies,the lyrics were like sweeeeeeeeeeeeeet like chicken they like go to out homeboys in Idaho YA this is to you boys it said like to many naughty words that my mom don't like beep and beep my homegirls and me have the CD and then when it swears i have to plug my ears it was like the sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeest CD i ever got. peace out!
2,nope,"Well, although there are a couple good songs on this album, it does not even come close to the first. DMX should of waited for more good tracks before releasing, instead of putting out junk early to get money."
1,"Do not buy this CD, it sucks .","Dmx iw no good, his rap sucks and he iz never going to be az good az tha best rapper ever : 2PAC. R.I.P 2pac, you will always be in our hearts."
1,DMX IS A CLOWN,THIS CD IS A JOKE. I WOULDNT WANT TO GO ON TV LIKE DMX. MY MOM WOULD KILL ME. MY GRANDMA WOULD CRY.THIS CD MAY NOT LEAD TO DEVIL WORSHIPPING. BUT A WHOLE LOT OF CONFUSED AND ABUSED YOUTH WOULD DO MUCH BETTER ROTATING GOSPEL IN THE WALKMAN. RATHER THAN A MESSAGE OF VIOLANCE AND HATRED.
1,cops and robbers,"I remember that game from kindergarden. DMX has the brain of a 5 year old. And is a figure head for the developmentally disabled.The lyrics on this disc are unbelievably wack.DMX is gonna get what he deserves, as all crooks do.At best DMX will wake up at age 35 and realize that he has flushed his life down the toilet. It's too bad he will take part of his audience with him."
3,A Rushed project,Had DMX taken his time on this one it may well have been a wonderful album. Unfortunately it doesn't contain hardly any memorable lyrics and the sound seems like it was taken directly from his previous album. Luckily we still have his other albums to listen to.
2,I think DMX is using Tupac's image.,"I would have to say that I'm very impressed with DMX. However, I think he is using Tupac's image to sell records. Aslo there are many rappers out there who are using his image. I would like to say for all those rappers coming up in the rap business be your own person and do not try to be like someone else. Thank you for your time."
4,This cd is the BOMB!!!,"I really like this cd, but when i got it I admit I just bought it for the song slippin. Then when i bought i the whole cd was good but when i got to sliipin I couldnt get the the whole meaning because half the song was edited. But besides that it was a great cd."
3,"fair, but not up to potential","I must admit, I love DMX, so therefore i cannot totally rag on this disc. But i must say DMX can do better than this. Its dark and hell is hot is one of the tightest albums i've ever heard. This album just doesnt have the tight beats and excellent rapping that is featured on Its Dark and Hell is Hot. But i still got much love for X anyway. I saw him in Pittsburgh on the Hard Knock tour, and he was the best performer by far outta all of em. This CD may not be great, but much love to D anyway-"
1,More bad poetry to a drum machine.,"Thank you Hip-HOP.Thank you for such witty memorable epigrams like""Beep beep who got da keys to da jeep""and""Put your hands where my eyes could see"".Oh yeah,and""Stop,drop(presumably to pick up a banana)shut'em down"".I almost forgot,thanks for casual vulgarity and irresponsibly glorifying a ultra-epicurean,scumbag lifestyle.I wish they(Hollywood)would make a sequal to DW Griffiths masterpiece""The birth of a nation"".It could be a documentry about Hip-Hop(kinda like the first one and that was made in 1914!!!"
3,"Not as good as ""It's Dark and Hell Is Hot""","This is X's 2nd album, released in the same year of the marvellous ""It's Dark and Hell is Hot"". This CD ain't that good, of course there's great moments like the reunion with The Lox and Jay-Z (I don't remember the name of the song now)but overall is kinda disapointed if u r expecting some like his first album...Swizz Beats is wack, no doubt, his beats don't have anything original, he blasts his keyboard and that's all..."
1,Not my cup o' blood,"I mainly listen to underground hip-hop but I knew DMX was the hot seller so I had to pick up a CD to see what I thought of it. I knew going in that it would be over-the-top violent, but I didn't expect it to be so repetitive. A few of the tracks are juicy but most of them don't reward repeat listens, so I can't really justify playing the CD to hear the good songs. The Swizz Beatz production gets old quick. Plus, now that I know that DMX is a bad mother who will devour his enemies and that he loves his b****es, I've heard 90% of what he has to say.The other thing that bothers me is his ""spirituality"". The martyr image in ""Ready To Meet Him"" just doesn't jive with the thuggish, vengeful persona in most of the other songs. I guess it's an Old-Testament-style of religion that DMX subscribes to."
5,dmx keep them coming babyyyyyyyy,every time one of his cds came out it was at a hard time in my life listening 2 his music guided me so unbelieveable he is 4 real
3,Only Two Good Songs,"Thier are only two good songs on this album, Bring Your Whole Crew, and Slippin'. His first one is much better. His newest one is better also."
1,i hate it,i think this was the worst cd.the mans weird and thinks hes tough.hes probably one of the fakest out there.all he talks about is killing which is somethin hes probably never done before.he tries to be like my man pac.irecomend you not buy this cd. the reason i gave this cd 1 star is because i couldnt give it 0 stars. (2pac is alive)
5,Impressed!!!!,"I loved this album. Dmx is truly a great rapper he has made a great name for himself with his voice and the meaning behind it. Although i could have done without ""Its all Good"" and believe he could do more with his talent than rap about B**** and H***.I still think he is one of the or the best rapper out today."
3,Not Enough Stand Out Songs,"DMX's second cd does not lack lyrically. Yes, the content is still the same, bt his rhymes hit you hard and fast. However, there are not enough stand out songs like on the last cd. There are only 3 songs that stand out on this cd. These songs are: #7 Comin From featuring Mary J. Blige, #10 Slippin and # 14 Flesh Of My Flesh Blood Of My Blood.Thats only 3 songs. Dont get me wrong,this is a great cd if you already like dmx, but if youre not DYING to get it,id skip it and go on to his next one. This one is not realy that great."
3,DMX IS NYC'S HOTTEST RAPPER RIGHT NOW,"I THINK DMX SHOULD NOT MAKE TOO MANY ALBUMS TO FAST, MOST RAPPERS PLAY THEIR OWN MUSIC OUT, EXECPT MASTER P, HE IS ONE OF A KIND, DMX IS NYC'S HOTTEST MC RIGHT NOW HE SHOULD JUST SLOWN DOWN ON HIS OUT PUT, YA KNOW, STOP BEING GREEDY.."
1,If you only buy one CD this year...,...do not make it this one!! People actually like this?! This CD is about as enjoyable as nails down a chalkboard.
4,It does not have as meny good songs as the first one,He is not as good as he was in the first CD. The songs were not as good. But he did a ok Job but L feel he could of did bater.
1,"Just plain, wack album....",DMX should've spent more time in the studio cooking up this second album because honestly it's wack garbage. Let me explain this for you: his first album came out in summer and his second comes out in winter.... that means he didn't spend much time on it. After hearing this you will wish he did.if you are thinking of getting a rap CD.... I suggest: Dr. Dre- The Chronic Snoop Doggy Dogg- Doggystyle 2Pac- All Eyez on Methe most recent one of those three came out in 1996 but they're all better than this DMX garbage.
1,"Take More Time, X","This album is proof that time yields better results. This sounds like DMX made it in one day. It really ain't good at all. Their are a few dope songs, but as an album, this one is garbage. Dark and Hell Is Hot is leagues and bounds better than this [one]."
4,This album is hott,"compared to his first album he culd have done better. this album is still phat especially the track Flesh of my Flesh, blood of my blood. Slippin!! this album is phat!"
4,"pretty good, but...","this is a pretty good cd. i mean, i love the songs slippin and no love 4 me and some of da other songs are pretty tight, and the omen is not too bad of a song but, featuring marilyn manson in it? c'mon. dmx, your a TIGHT rapper but don't feature people like marilyn manson in your songs."
5,Great,"This isn't X's best work, but it is still off the hook. The best song is Slippin. The lyrics in that song and every other song he ever made, has some off the best lyrics. X speaks the truth and that's why he is one of the greatest rappers ever to make it big. Good luck in the future X!"
5,This CD kicks!,"This CD rules. I like better than his other ""It's Dark, and Hell Is Hot!"" DMX rules. You gotta buy this CD!!!"
5,THIS CD IS BY FAR OFF THE HOOK IN HIP HOP TERM.,"NO DOUBT DMX IS THE HOTEST UP COMING RAPPER TODAY, I SEE HIM BEING AS BIG AS 2-PAC, WITH CUTTS LIKE ""AINT NO WAY"" TO KEEP YOUR HEAD BOBBIN, AND OTHERS THAT WILL HAVE YOU IN DEEP THOUGHT LIKE ""SLIPPIN"" THIS GUY IS A LYRICAL GENIUS. THUMBS UP FOR THE ALBUM AS WELL AS HIS PREVIOUS."
3,Slippin' into obscurity...,"Let's be honest... This album is not all that impressive. A few good tracks, with a lot of filler tracks that can be very easily ignored.On the positive side, this album did birth one of my favorite hip hop tracks of all time: SLIPPIN'Why they never released an unedited version of this track is beyond my understanding. This DJ Shok beat is amazing. The Grover Washington Jr sample floats on with X laying his heart on the verses. This is not what people expected from DMX, but the hip hop soul in this track can not be ignored. Great track.A decent effort, but not enough quality hip hop tracks on here to truly impress."
2,TIGHT RHYMES; WEAK BEATS,"Yo, this cd is one of the tightest lyrical cd's ever. But it lacks one of the most important attributes in hip hop... BEATS!!! PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SOON REALIZE THAT THESE RUFF RIDER BEATS ARE FRAUD... As soon as DMX relizes that Swizz can't make a whole [good]album alone he will be one of the best MC's ever with some of the best albums ever..."
4,Good but not as good as His first album,"DMX's latest cd is one of the greater cds I have heard, but I don't think he matched His first ""IT's Dark And Hell Is Hot"". DMX does have some great songs on the new cd. ""Slippin' "" Is a great song and it shows that DMX is a great lyricist. "" No love for me"" another great song on this cd, has great lyrics, and a cool sound to it. Over all No matter what DMX Is still one of the greatest emcee of this year."
3,Aight,It's not at all as I expected. I thought it would be a lot better. His first album was so much better than this 1. I think he could've taken more time on this album to make it better but it's still aight.
4,he is not the next 2Pac,"DMX is tight but not original, his last CD was a bit better but the song with Marlyn Manson is tight as hell. Dont compare him to 2Pac cuz there not alike. Slippin should not have been edited but is still a good song. great CD till the last 4 songs then it starts to get kinda weak like he lost ideas for songs. Well you shouldnt release 2 cds in the same year. The cover is tight but the inside booklet is kinda graphic. Buy this CD ONLY if your a DMX fan not because you like one song always sample first."
1,sounds like an agonizing dog...,"Downright awful. Like all current rap music, this is sh*t on a disk. No point, no talent, no brain, no nothing...just noise...pathetic."
3,DMX 's vocal talent carries the album.,"DMX is one of the best vocalists in rap today. His skill carries the album where the sometimes lacking beats can't. Although not as good as his debut album, this album is very good and worth purchasing. This album does contain explicit content but any intelligent person would enjoy this for it's purpose of entertaining. Despite what some might say, this album does not promote devil worshipping and those that can't handle the content should look elsewhere. My only real complaint was that the track ""Slippin"" was edited, for what reason I don't know."
4,It's the ill,DMX proved that he is the new wave of hip-hop wit this ill cd following up it's dark and hell is hot. Though the first cd is better this is one of the illest cd's of the year.
1,What Happend???,Yo! this ablum is not even close to DMX last one. I think he rushed the release of this one. I hope on the next one he takes his time. So we can hear those venom filled songs that he had on his last record!
5,This album is tite and he is the bomb!,"DMX is the stuff. Ya'll need to quit hatin' on my boo! He is original and all he is doing is keeping it real. He's the best and he is way better than Tu-Pac. But they're both tite. But for real, give DMX his props!"
4,I think DMX ruffriders r pretty tough!,"DMX is the bomb. On My charts he's he's #2, but he's getting to #1. His new song ""Slippin'"" is pretty cool. I also like the song ""Stop, Drop "" That song isn't ""stopping me from listening"". Everyone at my school(almost) has heard of DMX. During lunch eeryone has one of his songs stuck in their heads. Sometimes I hear a few people singing""Yo I slipping,I fallen, I can't get up, get back on my feet so I can cashpp"" and ""The only thing that's stopping them is you, WHAT?"" I hope that DMX continues to write more songs and ""lives to see his kids do something else with their time."" Unlike 2pac which I also think is prtty cool(even though he's dead), I hope you live alot longer."
1,He Tried.......and that is all that matters......,"DMX is capable off doing so much more. ""Its Dark..."" was the tightest cd last year but Flesh ... is just another album filled with his little fantasies..and moments of self indulgence. DMX seems to have lost his touch. Another waste of plastic to put in the grave yard."
1,"dmx, thanks for keeping it real.","if kids in the geto are are stoopid and ignorant, then the music should be stoopid and ignorant.its about reality.im glad we have dmx to keep it real for all the real trash littering the streets. for all the pathetic petty criminal drug addicted losers that dont have a clue.why get an education in computers and a $60,000 a year job when you can just ""stop, drop, shut em down, open up shop"" (kill people and sell drugs) great dmx. thanks for keeping it real.p.s. i hope that rape charge doesn't hurt you career."
2,"Sounds unfinished, ""It's Dark..."" was better.","I had high expectations for this album, since ""It's Dark..."" was one of my favorite's last year. But, to tell you the truth ""Flesh.."" was a letdown. I expect more from DMX. The beats are just aiight, and his lyrics are unspectactular, and even corny at times. Only two tracks pack the punch that his debut had. Overall it wasn't a horrible album, but I expect DMX to come tighter than he did. Maybe more time off between albums could benefit him."
1,TOO SOON,"I personally think DMX (Dark Man X)brought this terrible album out too soon. He just came out with ""It's Dark and Hell is Hot."" There are a total of 2 good songs ,which I will not name. ""It's Dark and Hell is Hot"" was one of the best albums of '98. I personally think this is a waste of money. Hey, everybody has there own opinion."
1,Ruff Ryder is Ryding Ruff.,"Okay here's a guy who is apparently mad with his life cause there is absolutely no reason to be yelling and spitting all over his albums like that. I know, I know it's intentionally real hip-hop or something but this guy needs to take a chill pill cause he's ruining the face of rap history. His whole Ruff Ryding posse isn't doing much either backing him up with whack lyrics. And DMX isn't doing too well impersonating 2Pac's immage as a rapper neither cause that's going to far in trying to hard. His album may be selling well but that's cause they're purchased by the fans that feel just as angry at the world and dropped outta high school. Maybe DMX should go to R&B to calm things down a litte."
1,BIGGEST MAKAVELI BITER OF ALL TIME,"Hey DMX, guess what? You ain't 2Pac. This album is straight up trash. It's probably the worst album I've heard in my life. DMX is the wackest rapper of all time. If you want to hear a true thug album, buy ALL EYEZ ON ME."
1,Total copy of pac's style,"DMX copied 2Pac's style on this cd and on all the others. He cant think up his own style so he copies 2Pac, just like puff daddy comin out wit nuthin of his own. West Coast rap is tha best, and will always be tha best, unlike the east coast."
1,poor mans 2pac clone,nothing fresh or original his music beats and flow all sound the same.avoid it.he does a second rate 2pac job.
3,Slippin Fallin,The greatest song of 1998 I had to get this because of that song but the album is Ok not best DMX but good DMX solid album from start to finish
3,I don't claim to be a hip-hop/rap expert...,"so take what I say with a grain of salt. This is a pretty good cd, I bought it for my husband for Christmas and he was happy with it. It's not quite as good as some of DMX's other stuff in my opinion, but if you like DMX, you'll probably like this one."
4,Totally phat...but..,"I think dmx is the bomb he has the skills and the flow though the constant relaince on the ruff ryder team's production makes the album sound like a continous experiment for a new dmx joint on the whole it's deep Slippin is a phat track and we just added it to our radio station's playlist so ..i think dmx needs some new flava from dre,dj premier,and more of the west coast bounce peace"
4,tight skillz,"DMX's skillz reflected on his albums are so phat (in my own opinion). His first album waz a big breakthrough in comparison to his second. The way he expresses himself, u know... tha anger, anguish potrayed to implement what he raps n et cetra. I find it completely dumb to hear that DMX is tryin to clone another rapper n to anyone that thinks so... make a comeback to da REAL WORLD! if ur with me, keep on keepin it da real'st..."
4,"Good, but not his greatest","To all of those who are hatin DMX, who do you listen to? This album is solid. Most of the tracks on this album hit hard, but it's not as good as his first. And to all those who think he's no Tupac...No kidding. DMX is the hardest rapper, Tupac is deep too, but not like this, they're two different artists."
3,He's slippin' but he will get up!,"I think its true that Dmx tends to dominate his songs on one topic, violence but if he was to follow an artist like Tupac by broadening his contents, he would definatly make more sales."
4,Still Hot...,"DMX's second album, isn't as dark and hot as his first, but still better than the rest of his albums.The album is filled with bangers, and will for sure satisfy X fans.There is some songs to skip, but mostly they are all hitting hard.My favorites are : Intro, Bring Your Whole Crew, We Don't Give A F***, Slippin', No Love 4 Me, Dogs For Life, Blackout and Heat.Guest apperances by : The Lox, Jay-Z, Mary J. Blige, Drag-On.Production is mostly handled by Swizz Beatz...at his prime time.I definitely recommend it to your collection, just buy ""It's Dark and Hell Is Hot"" first."
4,Tight!,"It's good but not his best.His best one was his 1st, then his latest one,but the worst was probably this one.There are some awsome songs like his best ""bring your whole crew"" ""slppin"" ""flesh of my flesh blood of my blood"".All together its good but some songs suck so badly that i thought i was going to sell it, but then i listened to the whole cd and it was worth the money.So go buy it!"
1,Everything DMX does isn't tight,This album is awful. I don't see how people can say this album is tight with a straight face. His first album was tight but this album was rushed. Half of the songs DMX was depending on barking to make the songs decent. DMX is tight but he is definately no 2Pac. If you want a good album check out that Ruff Ryders Compilation or C-Murder's Bossaline.
1,Disgusting and vulgar,I think DMX is a really stupid rap singer. The cover of the CD is really gross! Who wants to listen to music full of swears?
4,Lloyd Banks!!!!!!!,"Lloyd Banks is the best rapper out there!! young buck did a pretty good job, and 50 is getting worse and worse by the day... If lloyd banks wasnt on this album, i would give this cd only 2 stars. Some of the tracks are hot, but G-Unit needs TOny Yayo back and fast!"
5,"A Queens,NY Classic","This album is hot, because it has great flows and great beats to with it. The first song to the last song is nasty. I recommend to buy this album if your a fan of gangster music and you are a big fan of 50 cent, the only thing is Tony Yayo didnt make the album because he was in prison. But the album is still great, the best songs probably are, ""My Buddy"" which has clips from Scarface, ""G'd Up"", ""Salute U"", ""Poppin Them Thangs"", ""Stunt 101"", basically the whole album is hott."
1,GARBAGE,I DONT HAVE NOTHIN TO SAY EXCEPT THIS CD IS SCRAIGHT GARBAGE.I THINK BOW WOW COULD COME OUT WIT A CD MORE SERIOUS THAN THIS.AND 50 AINT EVEN ALL DAT!!!!!
2,"Man, i expected a little more...",This cd was not that great and I expected something better...They had one hit song on the whole cd! And even the music video they had for WANNA GET TO KNOW YA was jus mainly sex. I hope they create sometin a little betta in the future.
2,Not much worth your money,"""Beg for mercy"" could have been great, but suffers from a lack of flow in it's lyrics. 50, Banks, and Buck work together well, but there aren't memorable songs on the album. This album is far below any of their solo albums.Reccomended songs: Poppin them thangs, My buddy, I'm so hood, Stunt 101, Eye for an Eye,"
2,A Big Disapoinment,"After 50's incredible debut album, Get Rich or Die Tryin', expectations for his crew G-Unit were very high. 50 talked about the album for weeks before it dropped saying it would be one of the greatest of all-time. Like many I bought this album the day it came out, and it was quit a disapointment for me. Every song sounds the same, they are all just cheezy singles. Plus, although Lloyd Banks and 50 are extremely talented, the 3rd member of the group, Young Buck is terrible, sounding unfortunitly like many of todays so-so MCs. Though Stunt 101 and I Wanna Get to Know Ya were cool, there is not a whole lot on this CD to justify a buy."
4,The solo artist will always outshine the crew.,"This cd is more of a delightful hip hop sampler than anything. It has it's varieties of gangsta rap (My Buddy (which takes a lame sample from the My Buddy Doll theme) ), bragging rap (Stunt 101), sexual rap ( I Smell Pussy), and etc. The lyrics are on point, and great. People need to realize that G-Unit is 3 people, not 50 Cent."
2,DAMN!!!!!!!!!!!!,"OKAY we all was tricked by the hype of 50 Cent but this is garbage i'm sorry but i think i expected too much from this album Lloyd Banks is nice,Tony Yayo is barely on the album,Young Buck is hot 2 but 50 is str8 up wack...the only good tracks or at least good enough 2 listen to are ""G-Unit"",""Stunt 101"",""Gangster Sh*t"" (even tho it was on some mixtapes) but the rest is kinda wack they even sing in it (well 50 at least) wasn't this the reason why he hated Ja Rule????? hmmmmmmm well Ja's album is waaaaaayyyy better than this garbage go pick up Ja Rule or Jay-Z sorry but i think that the G-Unit is not gonna blow like most people expected or like they did just cuz 50 blew up don't mean anything the best in G-Unit are Lloyd Banks,Tony Yayo,Young Buck and who else did i miss???? well those 3 are the best better than loose change"
3,OK - BUT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"I bought G-Unit and FORBIDDEN: THA ONLY CHILD, I actually think the FORBIDDEN album is better."
1,YEAH RIGHT,"they should have called this THA INFORMANTZ, BEG FOR A STATEMNET, so ****DALTON HIGGINS**** I SEE WHOS BUT YOUR LICKIN AFTER SEEIN YOU RATE THIS AND THEN SEE JA RULES REVIEW YOU DID!"
1,Wack,50Cent has had quite a year&is still trying to find other ways to cash in on it&this set seems more about cashing in than bringing anything new to the table.His flow is so tired that He could have you sleep walking while you are awake trying to listen to Him.He was a Better Artist years ago before He got all this spotlight.the Beats are wick overall&this has the makings of better cash in before my 15 Minutes are up.
3,"Good album musically, too many gun-related tracks","This album by 50 Cent's group G-Unit, is strong with the music and the lyrics. The only flaw I have with it is the gun references that continue for 3 to 4 straight songs on the first half. 50 and Lloyd Banks tend to rap the most lyrics on them. The one they did with Dr. Dre at the near end of the album is so funky and addictive and everything all clicks. Another plus I like--NO INTERLUDES! All full length songs for all 18 tracks. There's one positive song about God on this album that breaks them away from the street themes, so they get points with that. I think that this will be a good in-between project between albums by 50 Cent. Lloyd Banks has a unique flow and vibe in his raps and cadences--hope he makes a solo album soon. But this is real, very raw, in how this group expresses themself about street life in this album."
2,Average,"G-Unit is a original hip hop group, alot better than some hip hop out there now a say, overall my favourite tracks were I smell Pu$$y and Mu Buddy, also, Smile by Lloyd Banks, others weren't quite up to par however. Don't waste your time this is bland and the beats all seem so alike and get annoying after awhile. Buy a Jay-Z or Ludacris record, well worth it."
1,horrible,"First of all, I would like to say that even the songs they play on the radio by G-Unit aren't that great. ""Smile"" sounds almost like 21 Questions on 50's album and Stunt 101 sucks. Most of Hip Hop today is not like what it used to be in the 80's & 90's. Mostly the 80's were even better because most of them didn't talk about killing or raping anybody, it was all about having fun ex. (MC Hammer, Vanilla Ice, or Coolio). For my final sentence I just wish Hip Hop could be like what it was back in the day."
1,What The F**k Is This S**T!!,My bro bought this CD and when i heard it i realized how bad G-Unit and 50 cent are. They sing about the gayest crap
1,Disapointed !,"This album is wack, there is no song here that is lyriclly good and challenges you.All they rap about the same things over and over again. Things like Im a gangsta Im gonna kill ya I am dangerous look out or we'll kill ya. Some beats are ok, but the rappers are unexperinced and have no talent at all(Young Buck). They just rap just to rap without any deeper meaning. There is no song here telling us about the life of these ""gangstas"" and there is no song here that will stand out like WOW. Save your money people and don't buy this album cuz you will be disapointed. 50 was just a phenomenon, now he and his crew is a BIG plot.Invest your money in Jay-Z's Black Album there are some serious good songs there."
1,dreamy but hopelessly out of reach,"these guys in g-unit are absolutely GORGEOUS.it's too bad they're gay, because i'd really like to get with them.oh well. maybe my younger brother stands a chance with them."
1,HATAZ GOTTA GO!! GIRL UNIT DA BOMB!!!,"ALL DEEZ HATAZ SAYIN GIRL UNIT BE FAKE, DEY GOTTA GO! AINT NUTTIN FAKE ABOUT DA PAIN DEY SINGIN ABOUT. IT REAL HARD GOIN TRU LIFE HIDIN WHO AND WHAT U REALLY BE, PRETENDIN YOU SOMETIN U AINT. GIRL UNIT GOT DA GUTS TO STAND UP AND BE COUNTED. DEY DA FIRST RAP UNIT DAT AINT ASHAMED TO PROFESS DEY LUV FOR UDDER MEN, TO LET BRUTHAS KNOW IT BE ALL RIGHT TO BE TENDER N TRUSTING N GIRLISH IF DAT U TRUE NATURE. WHEN RAP MASTER REGINA TRIX ON TRACK 9 TALK ABOUT HIS DIFFICULT TRANSITION FROM MACHO MAN 2 TRANSVESTITE 2 FULL BLOSSOMING TRANSSEXUAL WOMANHOOD N HIS/HER PAIN OF FINDING A REAL MAN IN DIS SOCIETY DAT WONT ACCEPT TRANSGENDERS, WELL IT BREAK MY HEART. DONT BE A HATA, BE A BRUTHA LUVA INSTEAD. GAY POWER! BLACK POWER!"
1,An embarassment to music,"How can people listen to this garbage??? Its all the SAME crap over and over. Look, if your some helpless teenybopper wondering how 50 Cent is ""sooooo talented"" then I'll give you his recipie to success:1. Have a horrible voice that has no personality and sounds dull2. Write lyrics about guns, women, cars, and ""bling-bling"" over and over and over.3. Press the ""demo"" button on a synthesizer and a drum machine,And there you go! You'll be on your way to platinum success in a matter of days and idiotic high school kids all over the nation will be blasting your horrible music in their craptastic used cars with the bass all the way up to make themselves be ""cool"" and ""in"". Have a great day and enjoy your success.OHHH I forgot one step: you have to make a video where your in a club with women who will be wearing basically nothing and you must be wearing baggy clothes, ""bling-bling"" and have pointless hand gestures."
2,An Absolutely Pathetic Album,"Lyod Banks and Young Buck tried to capitalize on fifty's popularity with this album and it might have sold but it's still terrible. The album is littered with tracks tellin of how they're going to kill people and how dangerous and tough they are. Then they go on to brag about sexual exploits. You'd think they'd find something actually deep to rap about. However, they don't and the result is a very poor album."
1,J. Trujillos mom is on crack,"You know why J. Trujillo mom is on crack??? its because she raised a retarded crack head name J. Trujillo. N-E ways J. Trujillh.o.e. is another teeny bop f@gg0t defendin the pop singers. What im talkin about in my other review about Tupac is before he died (stupid azz Trujillh.o.e. dont you get it retard). Tupac didnt see the person who shot him. Yeah I guess bullets are hard to dodge. I guess the person who sh0t 50 cent, gots the most perfect aiming. Trujillh.o.e. can go to hell with his pop fans. and yeah im sorry I made fun of your fan 50 cent. I guess it was a joke that mad this teeny bop loser Trujillh.o.e. that made him cry. So stop whining like a baby or stop acting like a pansy and grow up!!! pleeze."
1,G-Unit sucks,G-unit is terrible. I have yet to hear one good song from them.Iv'e never had my gag reflexes triggered so quickly before. If you plan on buying this don't forget to buy something to drill your ear drums out too. I gave this cd a 1 because i cant give it a 0.
3,Lets be honest...,"Is this the greatest cd ever...No! Is this the worst cd ever...No! Both these points are very clear after one brief listen to the album, but no one who reviews the album seems to fall within the range of the two extremes. Fifty has flooded the market, and everyone needs a little break from him. Regardless, he still put out a solid album with a lot of good tracks. They aren't amazingly thought provoking, inspiring songs that will change your life, but there are a lot of good tracks that G-Unit fans will like.P.S. If 50 cent is not gangsta, who is? Maybe if he gets shot up or put in jail again he'll qualify."
2,FREE YAYO (AGAIN!),"yep, a definite, DEFINITE disappointment...goes to show with Dre or Em, 50's not quite the greatest he could be."
2,Pretty bad,"This CD pretty much sucks. I find it hilarious that the Amazon.com reviewer called this ""one of 2003's best releases""...the only possible explanation is that he was afraid of getting shot by fiddy."
2,ehhh,it's ok. it's really nothing special. i was expeting something a whole lot better from g-unit. maybe it's because they're making too many love songs.
1,boo,his old cd was great. This one doesnt have as many good songs. He already launched 3 videos of the cd. He doesnt really last long on many count downs.
5,Hot,"OK, G-Unit's CD ""Beg For Mercy"" is one of the best rap CDs I've ever heard. The songs were produced good and each and every beat sounds hot, especially the ones with Dr. Dre as the producer. 50 Cent, Lloyd Bank and Young Buck, all have that unique sense of rapping that makes them that much better. Eventhough they rap about the material things such as cars, money, girls, and fame, they still have that sense about them that makes it a great CD. I have listened to it so much the CD is worn out, and that is no exageration. This CD has a nice mix of rap and r%b with each chorus having the perfect feel and perfect match for the song. This CD is truely one of the best Hip/Hop CDs out there and everyone should buy it...Best song(s): Beg For Mercy / Baby U Got / Groupie Love / Wanna Get to Know YouBest chorus: Beg For Mercy / Baby U GotBest Rapper(s): 50 Cent / Lloyd Banks"
2,LLYOD Banks steals the show..,"The album is weak every song in it sounds the same.I knew this album couldn't compare to 50's Get Rich or Die Tryin,if you were thinking of getting it hoping it would be as good,don't even waste your time,unless you are a G-Unit fan.It has a couple of nice songs,but it gets played out.If it wasn't for Llyod Banks the album would go in my Hall of Shame Wall.The theme:MURDER,KILL KILL..Some nice songs to listen to if you do pick it up:2. Poppin' Them Thangs3. My Buddy5. Stunt 1017. Groupie LoveToo much publicity not enough rhyming"
1,This album is worth just about 50 cents,"I just listened to Beg for Mercy for a few days looking for something to like, but then gave up.After his first album delivered a fresh stylized voice with deep feeling, Beg for Mercy is a sophmoric re-run that would be better titled, ""Proof I'm a one trick pony""The problem with this album is that the thematic range has shrunk to only the ""guns and bling-bling"" that we've all heard before. The styles and ryhmes are just not compelling and there is not a single track on the album with real power or originality. Don't waste $12 on it."
2,"Ok, but a big dissapointment...","I was expexted alot from the G-Unit album, Lloyd Banks is a much better rapper than 50 is but he didn't really shine like I thought he would. The worst part of the album is that one of the members (Tony Yayo) in locked up right now so he's only on 2 tracks. Young Buck is the newest member and does an alright job but Yayo is a much better rapper. On top of that theres just some awfull songs that should have been left for the mixtapes or just kept unreleased like: My Buddy,Better Ask Somebody,Baby U Got & (song title) which is a year old song off a mixtape that was just thrown into the album. But there is some tight songs on here check out ""Poppin Them Thangs, Wanna Get Yo Know You, Groupie Love, Eye For Eye & G'd Up. After buying this album 50 Cent had me saying GGGGGGay-Unit!"
2,Average,"When 50 came out he was straight gangsta! Dissing weak rappers for rapping about girls(Ja Rule)and flossing. I was kind of shocked to hear the G Unit album, when there is a considerable amount of weak songs about ""thugs"" in love(4-5 songs in fact) and even the ""Cash-Money"" inspired first single ""Stunt 101"". I used to agree with 50 Cent when he called out weak rappers like Ja Rule, but I guess it was all a marketing campaign and he can't wait to become a pop rapper himself.""There ain't no room for half way crooks"""
3,"Banks, go solo","All three stars go to Banks and one full star for his 40 sec bit on My Buddy. The beats are lame 50's style is limited and won't really expand beyond In The Club and I forgot who the other guy was. My next G-unit purchase will only be a solo-unit purchase of Lloyd Banks, who has the most potential."
1,Can't Think Of A Title.,"""I Smell P*&&y"". I don't understand why musicians have issues with each other (Examples : Eminem/Christina Aguilera, Jay-Z/Nas, etc.) What I also don't understand is why 50 Cent insulted Ja Rule for singing in a song instead of rapping. Ja Rule sang on ""Rainy Dayz"" with Mary J Blige on the 2002 re-release of ""No More Drama"" but then on Mary's next album, ""Love & Life"", 50 Cent Is featured on it. I do not consider this entertainment. These people are role models. Their music affects a lot of people. I do not find it entertaining to insult other celeberties this way. When I hear music, I want to hear something positive not, ""I Smell P/*-) Is That You Irv? I Smell P/*-) Is That You Ja? Y'all N&^%%z Is P+:>y."" They need to set better examples for their fans."
2,More commercialized POP RAP!,Boring is the word for this one! Feels like each song is being played over and over BLAH!!! Get REAL music don't get this stuff!!
2,all hype no bite,"this cd is juz garbage, plain and simple. how can you criticize a man( ja rule ) for singin on almost every hook and thats what u are doing. this is really a waste of a couple of million cd's. none of these trackz rates over a 2.5, and thats the truth.GGGGGG GARBAGE UNIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Beg for Mercy should be begging for mercy,"Beg For Mercy No Stars.This is why we hate this album, because it represents not only everything wrong with hip hop, but music in general, the beats are terrible, the rapping is horrible, the lyrics are a piece of junk, the front cover of the album is worthless, even the title is stupid.When are these record executives gonna realize that selling records does equal talent nor creativity?Now I Occasionally criticize gangsta rap for being nothing more than a failure, but this is a rapper that's not nearly as entertaining as a lot of record labels in the past including death row records.Of all of the bad hip hop these last 10 years from the shiny suit era to the eminem era to the bad dirty south and nelly's & chingy's, This is one of the most painful to endure."
2,2 Stars for 2 Songs,"Young Buck flat out sucks. 50 can be good or bad, but his bad side especially bleeds through on this album. Lloyd Banks is the only one left, and even he gets lazy on some tracks. The only ones worth listening to more than once are ""Poppin' Them Thangs"" (hit fast forward when Buck comes on, or just listen to it for the beat at that part), ""Wanna Get to Know You"", and ""I Smell Pussy"". It's hard to really count ""I Smell Pussy"" though, since it was on mixtapes way before 50 even got signed to a major label. If you want some more 50 Cent you're better off getting his mixtape ""Guess Who's Back?"" to hear him at his best lyrically with some pretty good beats or ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'"" for awesome beats and decent lyricism. Once you get those two you can just download the highlight songs off lazy and boring albums like this one and ""the Massacre""."
1,50 Cent = Ja Rule,Only thing I gotta say about this album is how in the hell can 50 Cent diss Ja Rule for singing? 50 Cent sings more on this album then any Ja Rule album. And 50 stop with all the R & B.G-Unit need to change their name to The Five Heartbeats - Joe Buddenhahaha
4,G-G-G-G-UNIT,"G-Unit's debut group effort is a predictably solid gangsta rap album with solid production throughout backing gang banging, ho pimpin' lyrics. The N.W.A. of today(after the departure of Ice Cubes insightful lyrics). Despite what some reviewers say they do stray from thug life on a few more notable tracks like ""Footprints"" inspired by the potrait of a guy walking down the beach alone, but with two sets of footprints emplying God's presence and Lloyd Banks solo debut on ""Smile"" where he serenades a mysterious special someone and ends up being one of the highest points on the album(although they usually still manage to throw in a few lines about gats or ice). For the most part though this is still a CD of bangin' beats backing gunplay and despite the lack of a smash hit like ""In Da Club"" it should make lovers of the gangsta rap genre happy."
1,One of a long list of new wack rap cds out now,"Ok, the 50 debut 'Get rich Or Die Tryin'' was not bad but what on earth happened here? This album really is very bad, why did shady/aftermath release this? If G-Unit didn't have Em's and 50's backing they would be nowhere, they are just eating off Em's sucsess, the only good G-Unit music i have heared is from mixtapes and freestyles, people new to hip-hop may like it, but real hip-hop heads? Don't bother."
5,One of my favourite albums,Hip hop at it's finest ! All the songs are intelligent and the beats are amazing. Me likey ! Props to Fiddy and Lloyd Banks
5,My favorite cd ever,"Iv been a big fan of 50cent/lloyd banks and gunit for a while.This is my favorite cd of any rapper.It has sick songs,hard beats,great lyrics.Theres hardcore songs like beg for mercy which i love and baby you got which is softer which i love as well.What ever 50 spits out is gold."
1,"My goodness, what is this world coming to?","People, don't waste your time supporting these ass clowns. Life is too short...Thank you very little."
2,It's nothing special,"""Beg for Mercy"" was a cd i was anxious to get. When i bought this cd, i was expecting it to be just as good as ""Get Rich or Die Trying."" Though there are a few decent songs, it compares NOTHING to it. I'm not exactly dissapointed, but the same beat and lyrics just get a little old. If your looking for a good rap cd to add to the collection, you may want to look elsewhere."
1,Give thanx and praises to the MOST HIGH,"Greetings mi idren/sistren and give thanx and praises to the Most High...JAH RASTAFARI. I n I think that the time has come for you all to leave the slakness of the rap game and find music more meaningful. I challenge you all to listen to Hugh Mundell, Johnny Clarke, Rod Taylor, Bunny Wailer, Israel Vibration and Bim Sherman. There, you will find peace, love and unity. One Love and JAH bless"
1,9 bullets wasnt enough?,"Im begging that whoever tryed to cap Fiddy Cent try it again. This time, however, with a much bigger gun.As for the music, this gives talented rappers (I use that loosely, rap is garbage, always been, always will) a bad name. Do your ears a favor, take a blowtorch to this."
1,should get negative stars,"rap sucks. it is not music and requires no talent. if you like rap, screw you."
4,G-unit Beg for Mercy,"This CD is good. it's not the greatest rap albulm but it is a lot better than a lot of people on here say. If you don't listen to the CD, then how on earth can you give an honest opinion on a CD?The Best songs on this CD are:1-Want to Get to know Yu2-Stunt 1013-Smile4-Poppin them thangs."
1,CHU CHU WOOAH WOOAH,GGGG CHU CHU WOOAH COMON CHU WOOAH GGG YOU CHUCHU CHUCHU WOOAH WOOAH WOOAH CHUYOU COMON WAKARAKATAKA GROOOARR MU MU MU COMON CHU WOOOOOOAH BLEP BLOD CLOP CACHUMBA!
5,There are almost 600 Reviews for a Reason,"I've been a hip hop fan going on 20 years. From Rakim, Kool G Rap/DJ Polo, Nas, Dre.....I've listened to it all while it was hot.The big thing these days is G-Unit. While some of their new stuff may not be all that great, their original album ""Beg for Mercy"" is undoubtedly a classic. The beats are ALL solid, which is an extreme rarity.Many people don't like these guys because they openly disrespect other rappers. So take the reviews with a grain of salt, there is no doubt this is one of the all time classics. You won't find a single song/beat that will lose your interest.That is a HUGE rarity these days. Even all time greats like Nas release albums with 2 decent songs and 11 throw aways. G-Unit does as well now, but not back in 2003. They were hungry for respect and it showed."
1,why.... gun gun gun gun gun gun..........................,"if u are looking for an ablum to, expreience how gun sounds then u can try this crap,all i keep hearing is gun shot,bling bling,i will kill u,we are g.a.n.gstar,this ablum is really a dissapiontment,Hhmmnmm....don`t waste your money on this."
2,wow...way to much hype for the album,"well this cd is what i expected...50 is the first rapper since, u guessed it..JA RULE...to get worse with each record he does...how do you go from ""how to rob"" which is when he flowed ridiculous, to this sh*t now? I talk faster then he raps, and now its alllll punchlines. Young buck has a shot at being a star from the south but he needs to get away from 50 and stop tryin to ryme like him , and lloyd banks is just another Fabolous...a rapper with good rymes who loves to make songs for ladies and repeat himself...the best part bout the cd is the dre beats...other then that its nuttin good....gangstarr can sh*t out better records then this"
3,"3.5 STARS-A GOOD ALBUM, NOT GREAT THOUGH","There are quite a few good songs on this album, but there are quite a few songs that could use improvement though. If this album is cheap-GET IT, if not-DON'T BOTHER! G-UNIT!!!!"
2,Stunt 101,"on this extremely violent album there are only a couple bright spots. one is the first single Stunt 101. it's obvious why they put this song out first bcz it is the best. it has a very video game, carnival ride sound to it. the only other one that isn't bad is Wanna get to know you. the other bright spot is the rapping. i think Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo are interesting to listen to. Yayo is very energetic. Especially on Stunt 101 they do some good rapping, even 50 who usually sounds lazy and uninspired. i guess it's bcz he has his boys with him. this album is not great but its not the worst i've heard. plz take this from a child if you see them with it. this is too violent. i don't know why these rappers have to be like that. don't they realize that it's just about the beats?!"
2,A tad overrated,"I dont hate g-unit. More or less I hate the hype that was around them and the hype around this album. Standout Tracks:POPPIN THEM THANGS, MY BUDDY, G'D UP, LAY YOU DOWN, GANGSTA S***, G-UNIT. Filler: I smell p****(diss record turned love jam? WTF?), Im so hood(no you're not), Stunt 101(crappy beat, booty lyrics), Groupie love, Betta Ask Somebody, Smile(they're dissing Ja while making songs like this?), Baby U Got, Salute U, Eye For Eye etc. Bottom Line: This album is one of the lowlights of the year hands down. In a rush to capitalize of the success of Get Rich Or Die Tryin 50 and crew put out this bad album. Lloyd Banks and Young Buck bust some decent verses here and there but 50 forgetaboutit! The production is weak plus the lyrics are below average. It might have sold 2 million copies but its not worth 50 cents."
2,Starts strong but ends weak.,"I'm not a big fan of commercial rap (nelly, chingy, j-kon?)But anyway I heard 50 back in the winter of '02 with wanksta. It was good i was thinking this guy got potential and i thought his debut was crazy. Then i heard g-unit is getting a cd in winter of '03. I got it the first week cause i heard Banks' freestyles and they just unbelievable.Thats when i got disappointed. I think the first 3 songs are really the only good songs on this album (G-unit, Poppin them thangs, My Buddy) after that it was all garbage. Not realy garbage more of a huge disappointment especially from banks, cause ya know the fame got to 50 and buck is just there he's reminds me of the new camron with crap lyrics.Really G-unit is very overrated all they got is banks and game though he got kicked out. Yayo isn't in much and i just mentioned the other 2. IF I HAD to reccomend a g- unit cd it would be 50's first album or game's documentary.If you want some good rap group albums buy some wu-tang or nwa."
4,Quite nice,"If i had done this review two weeks ago i would have called them the _second_ best living/working group in rap (Westside Connection being number one), now they fall to the third best, the ""213 The Hard Way album is just smoking."
2,it's 50 cent...with two more shmucks,"don't get me wrong, don't think i gave this album 2 stars because i hate 50 cent. i don't hate 50 cent, i just hate his half-assed ""gang"" g-unit. 50 cent is the only one in this group with lyrical ability. lloyd banks maybe but definately not young buck or that yayo guy.their subject matter is the same: jewerly, guns, weed and maybe thug love. just put up with it for 18 tracks and you'll get sick of it. i know i did.the only good point about this album is the very first song. the beat is awesome and there aren't any stupid hooks about ""cappin' a n***a"" or any of that bs. sorry but i just can't give this CD anymore than 2 stars. 50 cent should rethink what he's doing.oh yea. and it's definately not white kid from the suburbs music so stop listening to it if you don't live in ""the hood""."
1,no words can explain how bad this is...,"(...) THIS IS THE WORST GROUP EVER to come out of music, period. This is the most un-talented group of people I have ever heard. These fake-asses REALLY need to be shot. I don't believe one word about how 50 was shot 9 times or some BS marketing hype. People, OPEN UP YOUR EYES and listen to something with meaning and actual TALENT. NO WONDER people think ""rap is crap"" because they are only being exposed to this (...) I really dont need to say anymore because the smart people out there wrote everything that I wanted to write . WU-TANG FOREVERpeace"
1,PITIFUL,this album is pointless the tracks are terrible and the beats suck the only good song is stunt 101 everything else sUCKS!!!
1,GARBAGE,"Whoever gave this album 4 or 4 1/2 stars didn't listen to it.50 'PENNIES' was jealous of Ja Rule's success, so he sold out by signing with eminem. Now he's doing whut Ja Rule's doing.'Poppin' them Thangs' and 'My Buddy' are the only songs i like in this album..the rest are just lacking. Don't waste your money or time downloading this crap"
4,just good,"geez, i dont know why everyone needs to judge rap albums so politically... not everything that's commercial has to be bad. so maybe there aint nothing groundbreaking on this album to make it a classic, but it dont change the fact that there are some dope beats and tight hooks on this. (poppin them thangs, wanna get to u know you, etc...) some people just wanna listen to music for its own sake - there doesn't always have to be something fundamentally profound about it. this applies to all other so-called ""sell-out"" artist; man, rappers gotta make money, people don't seem to understand that artists need to reach a broad audience, it's how they make a living. yes, it would be nice to stay street and underground and gangster forever, but even rappers gotta eat."
3,ok... what is the deal w/ lloyd banks,"ok... everyone says that lloyd banks is the man... lloyd banks has to be one of the worst rappers every. his voice is horrible and he ruins the g-unit album. if it wasnt for banks this album would be awesome... but since lloyd is on it, it just isnt that good. what a shame. g-unit should just dump him."
1,PPPPPPP P-LEASE!,"This is wackness in its purest form. Every track on here sounds the same and 50's lyrics is garbage. If your looking for hot beats to put in ya ride, don't buy this. If your looking for hot lyrics, don't buy this.Infact, here is some recomindations:Ja Rule - Blood In My EyeJay-Z - The Black AlbumTalib Kweli - QualityCanibus - Rip The JackerGang Starr - The Ownerz"
4,Beg For Mercy = Beg For Water To Pour On This Blazin Album..,"This album is FIRE!!! Beats on this album are sick! a couple joints on here could've been cut from the final album. However, the final product is far from a disappointment. Let me just say ""G'd Up"" has incredible production, I'm really going to have to listen to this again. Definitely cop this."
2,First album from G Unit since 50 signed with eminem,This album is just hyped up its nuthin more than a usual hip hop album. everyone seems to be tricked by 50 cent so i guess everyone will go out and buy it any way. i peronsally thik you should save your money for something better
1,F-U G-U,"This is a complete waste of your money kids! How Could this guy get so god damn popular. Remember back in the good old days when everyone was lisaning to great bands like Nirvana and Pearl jam, But now everyone is lasining to this garbage. Don't get me wrong some rap is good (ex. Beastie boys, Outkast, K-Os, Run DMC) but latley This ""gansta rap"" is just stupid and repetitive, just look at evey one of this genres music videos it has at leat one of the following:1. Someone getting shot2. Money3. Alcoholand of course the one thing that almost EVERY F**KING ONE OF THEM HAS IS: half naked women being protrade as objects.so when your at a reccord store and your thinking of what to bye and your eye catchs a glips of g-unit...LOOK AWAY! and get the new Green Day cd instead because Gantsta rap maybe the thing righ now but i ashure you just like Dumb Pop of the 60's and Disco of 70's and hair metal of the 80's it will fade away and people will every wonder why the hell did we lisin to this!"
1,forget it,i used to like g unit. but every time i heard them on hot 97 i got bored of them. so if you like hearing repititive music this cd is for if not go get ja rules cd of blood in my eye and leave this cd in the dust.
1,I'm not really gonna review this but....,"I already wrote here a review something like half a year ago, but then homozon deleted my review. So for now I'm just doing this in order to help lowering the average to 1 star. This sh i t doesn't warrant my explanation."
1,getting old,"oh man the songs from this cd is ok but their really getting old and repititive. also on 50 cents new album coming somewhere in febuary well suck, because he will diss murder inc again ehich is getting irritating since it's annoying, and doesn't 50 cent ever get tired of dissing them, i mean why can't he just give up already. well it looks like shady/aftermath is going downhill which is sad because the rappers there used to be good, but not anymore, since ive been hearing them dissing other rappers, like on eminems song of like toy soldiers he disses benzino which is getting old, and is still messing with ja rule for what he said about haylie which is getting boring. ja rule i would say is better than 50 cent since he is making hot songs, and is not dissing anybody recently, while 50 cent, and shady/aftermath disses the same person over and over again."
3,A fake life.,"The only reason this album is getting three stars is because the songs have nice beats. Lyrically the album falters. Many songs are about guns,drugs, and women. Because of rappers like 50 cent and his G-unit crew, white America views us minorities as gun loving fiends. I myself have been a victim to such thoughts because of my clothing and occasional use of slang when visiting my father in a ""white"" town. 50 cent is presenting the wrong image of people from the hood and getting shot nine times won't give you respect in the hood. It will only get you shunned. Trust me."
3,My View,I like G-Unit but not as much together but better in solos this album is Perfect 4 the G-Unit soldier so if you are a G-Unit fan and dont have this get it....I respect G-Unit dont get me wrong but this album is lyrically perfect but the beats on this one dont move me as much as others but I will listen to it every know and then but its OK
3,Bad And Good,"G-unit's beg for Mercy is hands down Good but some tracks are just stupid, not even the tracks around that time G-unit got stupid, they were getting soft and realeasing porn called groupie love if Ja realeased that 50 would diss hinm to the floor, so I guess to G-unit sweaters his porn is okay hey matter fact Karma's Okay, Smile's Okay, 21 questions Okay, but Put it on me, Down 4 U, thats not okay so when you get a chance to get to look back think about how Ja wasn't the only soft rapper, 50 was , matter fact he was punk with a thousand body guards at the 03 vma's, but hands down again great album"
5,"""... I Can Go Against Nas and Jigga Both For The Throne""","""...If David Can Go Against Goliath With a Stone, I Can Go Against Nas and Jigga Both For The Throne"" There wasn't a more profound yet true statement ever. Unfortunatly Jigga (Jay-Z) is out after his tenth and last CD The Black Album. And Nas doesn't seem to be doin' to much. 50's comin' along with the rest of The G-Unit. There's no way to stop it: ""...cause I can't change it Can't rearrange it, I am what I am So love me for bein me..."" Get this CD, it may not be good at the first listen but after you find the tracks you like its the s%#t. Lloyd Banks, Young Buck, 50 Cent, Free Yayo, G-G-G-G-G-UNIT!!!"
3,"get off jay z""s nutz",dont get me wrong this is not the best album of our time but far better than anything to ever come out of jay z mouth he is garbage and there will never be another pac or biggie so we need to deal with it but this album needs more credit better than that commercial crap we get these days atleat every other word isnt i ride on dubs bling bling skeet skeet or right thre
2,"Man, just more pop-rap trash","I knew I shouldn'tave brought it, because 50's CD was an earsore, but I got it anyway, cuz it was 11 bux. But when I listened to it, I skipped through all but 2 songs, Mu buddy, Gangsta ##%%. All other songs were just an earsore, like groupie love, the ooh-sssooo anoying stunt 101, I wanna know you, I'm so hood, and all the other piontless sencess garbage on this CD.This CD will be a dissapoining gift under any christmas tree. It's like they wanted to rush a CD out to capotalize on 50's success, and to my suprize, it's working!! It's already double platnum.This CD is basicly for only people who like Nelly, Eminem, Jay-Z, Master P, Ludacris, and all the other pop rappers. Real rap fans, don't listen to this garbage.They wan't me to beg for mercy, okay, stop making me waste money, only to have my ears screaming, PLEEZ!!? ya know I'm gonna be a pop rapper! If it can get me a good million hey, why not? Ya'll wish me luckpeacep.s.You know I ain't no sellout"
1,Begging them to stop,"This album is trash! It comes in with a tight beat, but then they are all off beat the whole time. All the rest of the tracks suck, except for ""My Buddy"" and the beat to ""G'd up"" 50 must be saving his best hooks for his next solo, and dre must be saving the beats for his, because the hooks and beats ruin an already thrash ass album. Im begging you, leave this one on Amazon."
1,g-unit sucks.,"sorry, but 50 is a fake thug. i liked him better when he was 2pac. eminem sucks as well. i liked him better when he was in the movie ""cool as ice""."
1,Trust me when I say that humanity is decreasing...,What do you get when you combine some of the worst musicians in the world? You get G-Unit! So we have 50 Cent and some other no name idiots that I don't give a sh** about. The lyrics are horrible! You have one guy rambling like an idiot about how he has lots of money and that he has more prostitutes than anyone. You have a retarded DJ who plays beats that are headache inducing. And you have that random female singer who sings about how she's a slut and telling little girls to act all girly and all of that bullsh**. It's sad because at my school this stuff is king. There's a bunch of idiots wearing their G-Unit t-shirts while I come to school wearing a kick-ass Iron Maiden shirt. A couple of girlies say that heavy metal is scary and say that G-Unit owns this world. The title of this review says it all..G-Unit are the decline of humanity...:'(
5,Haters,Man i dont know why everyone wants to put this record down when is by far one of the best rap albums out there. You may not like this kind of rap but it is good none the less
2,Yo,Ima white boy.LOL. So generaly I dont listen 2 naughty music like rap. My friend happend 2 hav the CD. So I decided 2 listen 2 it. I was disgusted. Dare I say it. The CD had Curse words. I almost cried. I am scared of all these scary words i heard. If I wer u I would only get the CLEAN version.
1,WACK ALBUM,"This sh** is WACK full stop.I aint buying this sh** or waste my time downloading it.50 cents is now pop, while Ja Rule is gangster with ""clap back"". In my opinion Ja is a better lyricist. 50 only dissed other artists (esp Ja Rule) to comeup in tha rap game.Hold your own 50. Seems he couldnt with this album, he aint no gangster, jus a wanna be, - shame.Its also a shame Jay Z has retired.RAP IS DYING.Please could rappers please release new good albums for the rap industry and you will be rewarded with respect and good money.Rubbish albums such as ""beg 4 mercy"" would be rejected and burnt.Thank you."
4,"Above Average, But Could've Been Better","First off, I think most people already had bias before they listened to the CD, either good or bad. Thus, many rated it high and praised it when it shouldn't have been and many just said it was straight garbage when it's not. In my opinion, there are too many songs on the album which accounts for as some say, the repitition of the rhymes. Which they should've thought of since they recorded on a tour bus. Anyways, there are about 11 songs that should have made the final cut. Such as ""My Buddy"", ""Stunt 101"", ""Wanna Get To Know You"", ""Smile"", ""Groupie Love"", etc...Especially the ones with Lloyd, his flow is sick and Buck is average, you just have to understand where he is coming from in his rhymes. I would say buy the cd because there are some excellent tracks on it,just be aware that it could've been better."
1,50 is played out,"50 had his undeserving shine, but he did put his work in and he earned his money, but I am tired of hearing 50's monotone voice over and over. They scream g-unit over and over similar to Dj clue on his mixtapes, but if you are one of those 50 fans who never dies, even after 9 shots, or months, than buy it.If you want to hear his voice ruin almost every song in the chorus and take away from LLoyd banks, then buy it. It could've been a great album but it seemed 50 wasn't in the studio with the rest of G-unit. He seemed to work less than the rest of g-unit, maybe his 7 times platnium solo album made him less concerned with the success of this album."
3,I expected better,"After listening to 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin' and 'Guess Who's Back', I decided to cop this album. Needless to say, there are some good tracks (Poppin' them Thangs, My Buddy, I'm so Hood, Stunt 101, Gangsta Sh*t and I smell P**sy). But that's only seven out of the 18 tracks that are on the album. If you can, avoid buying the album and just download the tracks I listed. You'd be better off saving your money for an album that's more worth it."
3,D-block Soldier,"This album was ok. The beats are ok, The lyrics are the usual lyrics you'd expect from G-Unit. The album would be alot better if Yayo was on it instead of Young Buck."
5,G-Unit R Doin They Own Thing !!!,"This Album Is Off Hook, 50 Aint Even Punkin Ja Rule Or Murder Inc Cuz They Dont Got 2, BUt Ja Rule Neeeds 2 Punk 50 Then Talk To Farrakhan To Calm Shit Down, Yeah.....I Would Have Liked To Heard A Few More Disses To Ja And The Rest Of Now....The Inc...Atleast 2 or 3 Songs, But Otherwise The Albums Tight Songs, Such As Smile Those Songs R Amazing Never Knew That They Cud Make Songs OF That Quality Ja Rules Garbage Album Shud Really Get 2 or 3 stars Out of 5... G-Unit Have Taken Over This Album Is Real Tight"
4,Fire!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Just Copped this album this mornin'.Played all the songs without skipping any.The beats are hot,lyrics are hot.I think this is gonna sell!!18 songs.My favorite were:tracks 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,14,15,16,17,and 18.lloyd banks lyrics were fire.this album is gonna sell boy!!!!!track 18{i smell p****} is dissin' Murda INC.FIRE!.only thing this is missing is Tony Yayo.Buy this album if you like g-unit,you wont regret it."
3,a dissapointment,"mann, i was so set on getting this album, thinkin that it would be as good as 50's previous works, but i dont think i've listened to the entire thing more than once. there are a few good songs.. like ""wanna get to know you"" and ""i smell"" but those arent even as good as they should be. 50 has alot of creativity and potential, but since he's blown up its all gone downhill. he focuses more on the money and power rather than the music he's producing, and its fed to the public, mainly teeny boppers who listen to all generic music, and they eat it up thinking their listening to good music. music cant possibly be good if there isnt any heart in it. i havent really listened to lloyd banks that much, but as for young buck, he needs to sit his ass down."
4,What to expect from G-Unit,"G-Unit isn't a group known for great lyrics and songs that have a message, unless the message involves sex, drugs, or violence, and that is what you get on this album. The beats are hot, and this is definitely a CD to bump in the car, but it isn't anything more. Banks drops the hottest verses, and he is obviously the most talented of the group. I'm starting to grow tired of 50, if you want to hear him when he was good, listen to his old albums before he became Mr. TRL. And Young Buck is just terrible, he drops maybe two verses that could possibly be considered pretty good on the entire album.My 3 Favorite Tracks:My BuddyGroupie LoveEye For An Eye"
1,What is this crap?,"How can you people call this music? All they do is talk about being rich, killing people, and doing drugs. All rap sounds the same. It's a broken record. We get it your rich and supposidely kill people. Does that make you cool or something? This has to be some of the worst music in history."
2,That's the Mainstream Vibe for Ya,"This CD is bad. It got a lot of mainstream hype, and I'm not surprised that it's below expectations for anyone who likes the real hip-hop. I've listened to G-Unit before 50 was with Dre, and I liked it. Some of it sucked, and that's what mostly came out on this album. Lloyd Banks, being the best of the three, really needs to get his solo career off the ground. I'd buy his CD over this one any day. Young Buck is all about ""f*** this b****, buy that Bentley"" and should get away from this group as fast as possible. 50 does the usual and gets money. I really have to say I miss the old G-Unit, but with all the attention they're getting they probably won't go back.If you want good hip-hop go pick up ""Illadelph Halflife"" by The Roots or ""Neighborhood Watch"" by Dilated Peoples."
1,A big joke,"50 Cent is like Eminem.. A huge publicity stunt. And that's what this CD basically is as well. A big joke. Three guys full of bravado running around claiming to be big tough thugs.. But for crying out loud, Stunt 101 was generic and hella boring. The only reason 50 Cent can sell some CDs on his own is because of his marketing image, and the fact that his label sells CDs to the stores and then buys them back. But as far as this album is concerned.. Stay away from it. G Unit may try to market themselves as normal rappers, but in reality they are more pop than Britney Spears. And the beats carry the entire album."
3,Not TRUE G-Unit,"I don't care what anyone says, this is NOT a TRUE G-Unit cd. Without Tony Yayo 100% involved, the G-Unit is not at full strength. Not a knock on Young Buck, but he isn't Yayo.I don't mind the effort. But would you call it N.W.A. without Eazy-E (with Snoop in the mix) ? NO!Free Yayo"
4,this is raw,"despite what everbody wants to think, or how much ppl r hatin on 50 BEg For Mercy is still hot. Very much hot indeed. and if you are tired of listenin to 50 then listen to the cd for lloyd banks, the kid can spit ryhmes way better than most rappers out today. this album has at least ten bangers they can get rid of ""smile"" an ""baby you got"" but other than that this cd'll be in my cd player for a while it's that gangsta it's a must have 50 spits banks spits an yung buck..........well yung buck hangs but it's live pick it up"
1,Wackness at its purest form,"OK, let me just start by saying that I am thankful that I bought the bootleg and not buy the real thing, because this CD is one of the worst I'v heard this year. 11 year old white boys are going o disagree, ofcourse. But as a true Hip Hop fan and critic, I listened to this record from beginging to end with a very open mind. The beats are OK on the most part, but the lyrics are pure garbage. 50 Cent is and will continue to be one of the most overrated MC of our time. ""Stunt 101"" was a horrible choice of first single, but people buy into that. Most of the record is monotone and foccuses on the same old, same old (similar to ""Get Rich Or Die Tryin'""). The most bearable track on this album was ""G'd Up"" and that still was not anything amazing. I suggest you purchase ""The Black Album"" by Jay-Z, or even ""Blood In My Eye"" by Ja Rule, for they are clearly better albums1luv"
1,G-UNOT,"Anyone who says that g0nit is composed of talented rappers with tight beats and could flow should be admitted to a mental ward. %0 cent and the rest of his cronies have no talent and struggle just to come up with bad lyrics. The album has boring production and they mostly sound the same, and just like them to overexagerate on Scarface paraphernalia, which officially has bored me, its only used to bring up their worthless strret cred. My advice for great rap groups are Westside Connection, Gangstarr, Public Enemy, NWA,Cypress Hill,Bone thugs n harmony, Beastie Boys, Run DMC, A Trbe Called Quest, and Tha Dogg Pound Gang which are way better than this tripe. PS to 50 cent fans, he aint the next 2Pac, he will never, ever be like him."
1,Why does everybody like this???,I really hate these guys. They make a terrible attempt at music. My fish is probably more talented then all these guys COMBINED. I could probably write and perform a better song then any of these guys. This stinks and don't buy it.
1,G-G-G-G-G-G UNIT S-S-S-S-SUCKS!,"I cant believe now these days the only good music people say is 50 cent. Are people out of your mind! G unit has no original music nor beats,the rhyms are lame and so on!I cant believe on mtv someone said on a mag that they compare50 cent to tupac! Dont even get me started! I cant believe they put this garbage for 18 bucks. If it was up tome Id put this crap for less than 50 cent cause they suck!But its your money so if you wanna spend money on dog s**t be my guest. And to think I was gonna burn this album from a friend.Dont get this crap!"
4,Sh*t is hot,"Forget all those other reviews that gave this cd anything less than 4 stars. this cd has sick beats and u know how good 50, banks, and young buc are from previous things they done. this is definitly a must buy if u like to listen to real sh*t. the hooks are also crazy. i bought this and jay z tha other day n these cds are hottttt. trust me, buy this cd, i dont buy sh*tty music."
2,HAHAHAHAH. This is a TERRIBLE CD,"This is standard in the industry. You get on by being the hottest member of your crew and you get your label to put out a collabo by some of your boys with you making a few guest appearances.Junior MafiaBraveheartzSt LunaticsG UnitD12Without fail these CD's are rushed, faulty in many ways and in general are an insult to the true hip hop fan.50 Cent jockriders went right out and snatched up this CD. They probably think it's pretty good to. I saw one cat talking about 50 cent as a lyrical genius or something. That's laughable. He's a decent rapper with a persona and image that's outsized his ability.This CD is strictly for 50 jocksniffers who are among the worst fans in hip hop. 50 is a nice MC, nothing more. He's certainly not better than Jay, Nas, Em, Rakim or even KRS one for that matter. But because all the suburban white boys love him and all the girls want to do him, he's very popular. Welcome to suburban hip hop boys and girls!"
1,This is ridiculous.,"Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away, there was a respectable art form called hip-hop. It was unique, it was constantly evolving, and it was exciting. Enter G-Unit. (Not to mention the many others who helped to kill hip-hop). Yikes. I'll keep this review short: Derivative. Clumsy. Forced. Laughable. Weak. Pretentious. That about sums it up.A closing note to all the ganstas out there: Shame on the lot of you. Shame on the people that support this drivel too.Do yourself a favor. Check out Murs, Del, Jeru, and the many others who are struggling to keep their message from being sucked into the roiling, stinking pot of filth that is MTV supported hip hop."
4,Beg for more!,"I think that this album has been slated a lot recently by a lot of people who obviously dont kno wat they r talking about. This album although it sounds thrown togetha is not getting the credibility it deserves. For example traks like smile and i wanna get to kno you show a slower side of hip hop on this album and are both amazin traks. But 50 and the g-unit also keep it gangsta with traks like poppin them thangs, am so hood, my buddy which are all good traks, then on top of this the songs i smell p*ssym stunt 101 and groupie love are all amazing traks. Therefore i dont think this album has been done any justice, the last few traks may lack and that is y it only recieves four stars, and they could have done without missing there new trak ""You"" from the album! But definately a must buy!"
1,Something Caught My Attention About This Album...,"While reading reviews of this album, I noticed that the only people who actually write reviews with proper spelling and grammar for this album are those who give it a one star review. Consider that before you expect people to take your opinion seriously, Rubberband Girl."
1,GgGgG GAY UNiT....,HA...please...y would u purchase garbage? too bad i had to fill in that one star...dammit
2,this guy is getting tiresome....and after just 1 solo album,"ok, when 50cent first came out I was a big fan, he had eminem and dr dre backing him, and his cd was very good....but now they put out this cd...I listen to the cd and can tell in the 1st listen which songs dr dre has produced (4 of them) which are the only 4 good songs on the cd. Just once I'd like to see a major rapper get an album produced by just one producer (like snoops ""doggystyle"")...next 50 cent album should be 100% dre and eminem....or this guy's career might be done"
1,Why does 50 wear a bullet-proof vest?,Why does 50 wear a bullet-proof vest? 'Cuz anyone who releases an album this bad oughta be shot. The only reason it deserves a star is because it's aptly titled. You'll be begging for mercy alright - begging for it to stop.
2,Riding 50's success,'I wanna get to know you' w/ GUNIT & Joe is the wonderful track. Unfortunately it was the BEST track. The rest of the cd is pretty weak. Save your $$ & borrow a copy from someone else.
1,off da shizzle nizzle dawgs,this cds isa greata dawgsi give this cd 5 stars and 3 thumbs upbuy this crap cd boysjk this cd is 2 starz
5,"This cd's tight, all you haters don't know rap","How can all you people think this cd is so bad, y'all need to chill the f*$& out and sit down and actually listen to this cd. It's off the hook mane! If you've bought 50's cd and you liked it you will definetely enjoy this. 50 spits and lloyd banks...ohhh boy watch out for lloyd banks, he flows. With songs produced by Em and Dr. Dre you can't hate on this cd at all. This cd's got 19 tracks on it and all of em are hot, buy it right now, trust me."
1,All their crap in one album,"All their mindless, greed rhyming, repetitive music placed in one album.This should kill some braincells if you want to torture some people."
1,please stoppppppppppppppppppppppp,"yea,there is no doubt,anybody that bought this ablum will definitaly be doing what i am doing now(begging to stop).all the tracks are wacks,when will 50cent and banks stop whispering to the mic,the rap sucks and even they couldn't go along with the beat,men this abllum really sucks...keep your money and go get blood in my eye...."
1,Oooh! Bad !,How a cd be bad like this cd? Copy this cd and be baddest as it can be! This cd sucks and it's all! This crew sucks and it's all! Shady Records sucks and it's all! 50 Cent sucks and it's all! Stupid lyrics...Don't make a good apparence of rap...Forget this cd...
4,Pretty Decent,"The first time i listened to this album i really only liked two songs(Stunt 101 and the first track, i forgot the name,) and i wanted my money back. But when i kept listening to it i learned to love most and stand to listen to the rest. It is an alright c.d for G-Unit's first i can't wait for their next."
1,Un grand coup de marketing!!!!,Eh ben franchement cet album mis a part 3 ou 4 chansons granx max n'est pas terrible que ca!! les musique font vraiement pitié encore une chance que 50 cent est là pour limiter les dégats en étant pratiquement sur toutes les chanson moi voilà cet album est plus un grand coup de marketing genre 50 fait de la pub pour ces anciens copains (qui le sont tjs) pour lancer un album trop incipide!! Ecoutez le bien en magasin avant de l'acheter!!
3,young buck sux!!!!!,"i really enjoyed this album. i think its great but there is one thing i disliked.their third member ""young buck"" known to many as ""red eyezz"". i really think g-unit would be better off without him. that just aint his style he should stay down south and eat chicken and not screw up 50 and the G_UNIT. most tracks are great, they rap about killing people and all that gangster nonsense, they also rap about girls and hoes.i think the album was great, i loved these following tracks:""im so hood"" ""stunt 101"" my buddy"", well any way i hope this review helped"
4,G Unit album impresses but could be better,"First off i would like to warn you about 2 things:1) Track 11, 'Smile' is amazing and will blow you away, and 'Stunt 101', 'Footprints' and 'G'd Up' are also fantastic.2) The two tracks after 'Stunt 101' are to be avoided because the hardcore gangstas g unit seem to be making RnB songs here!Apart from those two skippable tracks, this g unit album is very impressive and does more than enough to put Ja Rule to sleep with his latest release, and it was good to see that they have kept the Ja disses to a minimum. On the whole you wil love this album if u love g unit- i cant wait for their next one when tony yayo gets out of jail."
1,G-Unit=Ripoff,Anybody who listens to real rap knows the back of the cd is a straight ripoff of Mobb Deep's Murda Muzik. ( The tattoed hands.)
2,Beg for Forgiveness is more like it...,"Most of this album is garbage. They have a few good tracks on there (Poppin them thangs, My Buddy, I'm so Hood, I Smell P*ssy) but the rest of it is terrible.Please don't ever say that Stunt 101 was a good song, that track was just terrible. Wanna Get to Know You was decent, but still, not great. I thought this CD would be pretty good, considering it got all sorts of hype, and because Lloyd Banks is on it, but it still sucks. One of the only tracks where Banks gets quality time is ""Smile"" and that song was absolute trash, no quality whatsoever.I think that Lloyd Banks is the only good rapper on G-Unit. 50 Cent is way too overrated, and Young Buck needs to learn how to rap. Tony Yayo would be decent, but since he's still in jail and barely on the album, I can't say much about him. Banks has the best flow out of the group, and has the sickest lines. It's just a matter of time before he comes out with his own album and leaves G-Unit in the dust."
2,soldout,"After listening to 50 cent's old tracks on Guess Who's back etc, I was hoping for a phat album from G-Unit, However I was VERY!dissapointed with the album it was as commercial as you can get which was suprising as on How 2 Rob he slagged off commercial boys, but now has become one as well, I was also not impressed with Get Rich Or Die Trying as the lyrics were good but about the same thing over and over. On the whole I was thoroughly dissapointed at buying an album with just 3 half decent tracks 50 U HAVE FALLEN OFF ALREADY."
2,Just an average rap CD...,"hey 50, you didn't get where you are cause you were rapping about the same stuff and in the same way everyone else in the industry was. i'm not just hating on 50, cause G.R.o.D.T. and Guess Who's Back were great albums but this was just average. the only bright spot is ""Smile"" which is a solo from Lloyd Banks and it even just sounds like a Ja song with more creative lyrics.I would recommend a bunch of pretty recent rap CDs before this one...here are a few:Jay-Z Black AlbumObie Trice CheersOutkast Speakerboxx/Love Below"
3,whoa...y'all haters are trippin,"ok. this album isn't the bomb but it didn't bomb either. ""My buddy"" was a great track, so was: wanna get to know ya, groupie love, footprints, and g'd up. Al those hatin on this album is just mad cuz they can't break out on to the scene with their sucky rhymes. you need to stop hating. cuz u kno this album is good. i think old school rap needs to make a come bak though. So if you're sayin people need to bring bak the old schoo; style (fresh prince, run-dmc, etc.) you need to try and bring it bak!!!"
2,Absolutely Pitiful!!!!1,"Depressing, thats the word that best describes this album. If this is supposed to be the new king of new york(50 Cent) than the east coast is in some trouble. Lloyd Banks sounds like a mummy with his mouth full of s*** and Young Buck was the only one that has a two thumbs up from me. My Buddy was tiring and boring and wack. Nas and tupac made tight ass cuts using guns metaphorically, but those are two of the best rappers of all time. G-unit was only a hot group when dre and shady produced and had more of a say about what they putting out. If they want advice on to not have people get sick of you, SPEAK ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW BEST AND WHAT GOT YA'LL HOT AND SURE AS HELL WAS NOT NO GOD DAMN SOFT, SIMPLE, USING BEATS OVER AGAIN EXCEPT CHANGING THE TUNES JUST A TAD!! LET ME SUM IT UP, DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM UNLESS YOU GOT A MUFFIN TWEEN THEM LEGS. HOLLA!!!"
2,Hmmmmm.....,"This cd isn't bad, but its not great either. It has some potentially good songs such as ""Poppin Them Thangs"" and ""Stunt 101"", but like most other rap artists these days, the music is getting to mainstream and too concerned with making the big money. Artists are forgetting the essence of music and are getting sucked into the mainstream world more and more as time goes on. I would like to see these guys head in the direction of underground rather than aiming their music at 13 year old girls. It is really frustrating because musicians in the rap/hiphop world aren't even trying to make decent music anymore. I just hope that someday hiphop/rap music goes back to what it once was, and not keep heading down the road to fame and fortune and who makes the most money."
2,"Crimp Back, Mutha!!!","What that reviewer from Toledo says is simply libelous. There's no f***ing way that lead singer Slicey Dice can be considered ""nothing more than an actuarialistic prodroma sequestered in perpetuity and intended to be purely nullatory."" As if, muthaf*cka! You need only listen to this severable masterpiece to immediately grasp its undisputed place in the canon of rap. Think it could have come about without my man Slicey at the helm? Dream on, Toledo. Maybe our anonymous critic would care to tell us who's fit to shine Slicey's shoes...."
1,Wackness,"This is the worst CD I've ever heard. Thank god I borrowed it and didnt throw away my money. G-Unit are all wack, skip them.Get the Black Album or Blood In My Eye instead."
2,G-Unit needs to stick to mix tapes,And 50 needs to stick to releasing solo albums. there are about two good tracks on here.
1,I don't know why they've got success....,"In my country, it's like here.They're in the bestsellers club and in my country 95% of the albums of the top are horrible!I don't know why the worst rappers (except Outkast, Ludacris, Fabolous...) may touch the top then they're really bad.You don't know your bestsellers are better than the bestsellers in my country?If only the bad can be the best (not now) the music will not stay music!!!So, this lp is really bad and they sing wit a pop star, Justin Timberlake in a remix of his hit; know now what I say they're weak rappers?Because they'ren't rappers!!!Rappers wit a pop star let me laught!!Buy ""Chicken & Beer"" & ""Spearboxxx/The Love Below"" instead of ""beg for mercy""..."
4,Beg for Mercy!,"G-Unit's ""Beg for Mercy"" is an album that will not surpass the expectations of their fans, but even though that it is still a bangin' album that ""gives a new definition of gangsta"" as they say. In my personal opinion, the album starts off and finishes very strong, but the tracks towards the middle of the album are all alike, bound by the same topic, namely women. They also sound too unserious and out of context, compared to the overall mood the album and the artistic personas of the band create. 'Wanna get to know you', 'Smile' and 'Footprints' just sound too R'n'B to be representative of gangsta rap and G-Unit in particular. However, the album is full of straight hits and of well produced tracks, filled with incredible verses. It should not be missed, despite the few weak tracks on it."
2,Poor,"I never thought 50 was much of an MC, and this album just solidifies that fact in my mind..Banks is decent, but definatly not worth listening to the ramblings of 50 and Young Buck for the other 2/3's of the time..If you like Banks that much, wait for his solo release...He isn't that special, but better than 50"
5,Incredible Rap Album,"Best album I have listened to in a long time. I am a true rap fan and I think this album ranks up there with Illmatic, All Eyez On Me, Ready to Die and so on. Great lyrics with incredible beats. Best beats I hve heard since Liquid Swords. Go pick this album up."
1,50 Cent and G-UNIT Suck,"Has anyone ever heard 50 Cent and G-UNIT rap live? Obviously not, or you wouldn't even be considering buying this CD. They sound terrible in real life, the only way any person buys this CD is because of alot of voice-changing. It is seriously like that one Simpsons episode when Bart is in a boy band. Buy a better CD, like The Black Album by Jay-Z."
3,Great start!!,"This is a good piece of work from G-Unit. There are a lot of good songs on this album! I think that we can expect some good things from G-Unit in the future. If you like 50, you will enjoy this album. This is not an album to listen to from beginning to end, but it has some really good beats and some clever lyrics."
3,it's have to agree---,"with the three star review... lets keep it consistant, because this IS a three star album... medicore lyrics, and sometimes good production. Some songs are catchy and cool to listen to, and maybe if they trimmed down and sharpened up, it would've made a much more intense listen...still, it's just a bit of fun! =)peace"
5,Off the Chain!!,For those of you who said that this CD is wack must be smoking crack. This CD is banging!!!. The beats are good and 50 and LLoyd really show off their lyrical skills. I think this CD is much better that the Black Album. The only reaso it is #1 is because Jay is retiring. Go cop this disc!
2,wu tang wannabe's,"if I had eminem, and aftermath backing me I'd blow up my damn self word is snoopp and making a cd with 450 titled dpg unit please spare me."
1,I'm begging for a new cd,this cd is terrible. i've been anticipating this cd since about may when i first found out about this. 50 cent doesn't spit one good line on this album. young buck was better than i thought he would be but still sucked. i expected a great preformance by lloyd banks but his was pretty bad too. there are some okay songs mostly because of the beat. the closest song to a good song on the cd is g'd up. the beat is very good and the lyrics aren't way too bad. i hope lloyd banks cd will be very good.
3,This is solid albulm get it now,Fo people who know music you would know the g unit is a straight albulm. It wasn't like I expected it to be but 50 got a crew on his team cuz. Everybody know 50 and Banks hot but you gotta here my man from da dirty Young Buck. I know yall east coast fellas don't feel him but Buck got spits and and showed it on this albulm. Especially on Footprints track 9. I know my folks in the dirty feelin him but who ever aint feeling this albulm you dont know s%$# about music and you probably a Ja Rule fan or something
1,very weak,"man what the hell was 50 thinking!!! this is album is super wack!!! 50 aint hard, that fool is soft as cupcakes!! im glad i didnt by this garbage cd!!"
5,It's Been A Long Time,"It's been so long since some real Gangsta Rap came out. Now, don't get me wrong. No one can replace NWA or Ice Cube (after he left). The Old School is classic. But this is a nice break from all the hip pop that's bein thrown around. I love this joint, it's excellent. It brought back those feelings I use to get when listenin to the Old School jams. This is a great cd."
1,This CD is the worst I've heard in a while,I just picked this CD up today and I am ready to go outside and toss it around like a frisbee. The only good song on here is Stunt 101 the rest is garbage. It's like they just wanted to throw something out there real quick. Best advise I can give for this album is don't buy it.
2,All Hype,"I was very disappointed after listening to Beg for Mercy. I was excpecting songs that were as up beat and intersting as 50 cents Get Rich or Die Tryin', but boy was i wrong. Most of these songs sounded as if they were low class beats that they found on the shelf that no one wanted to use.Lyrics-The only person with good lyrics in this group is Lloyd Banks. The rest of G-Unit hold back the album. They should of let Lloyd banks shine moreOverall-Id have to say pass on this album. It didn't capture what would or could be another classic album. The only song worth listening to is Stunt 101, which isn't the best song so that doesn't say THAT much about the whole album. I'd have to say that this album is all hype. They could of did better then this."
1,You'll be begging for mercy after this mess.,"This is really the possible candidate for the worst album of this decade, there is no reason for anyone to buy this album, except about image and looks and the usual watered down gangsta rap, none of these songs are good, the rapping is terrible, the lyrics are intrusive and the GGGGGGG G-UNIT! Catch phrase is the worst in the history of all modern music, I Remember almost 20 years ago when straight outta compton came out, that album has better messages, better writing abilities and better skills, this one has none, it's just a stupid pathetic geek show with the same usual [...]When will the music business get rid of this pop gangsta rap and bring rap back into the lyricism and realness that it once had in the late 80's to late 90's?2Pac, Biggie, Pun and the rest of the rappers are turning in their graves.Beg for mercy is a towering acheivement in bad hip hop.Music Rating: No Stars."
2,This is getting old,It got old really fast. 50 can only give you so much of his change until he runs out. His follows are also gonna suffer from the 15 min game.I recommend you burn it or get it really cheap.
1,Weak,"To the fans of g unit this album is nothing compared to the debuts of other groups like CNN,LOX and D12 these groups albums were way better and never went pop like g unit. To the haters of The Game buy his new mixtape called You Know What It Is Vol 3 that mixtape is on fire with the 15 minute diss to g unit. G unit is probably gonna be around for a while cause mainstream will keep buying this. But I recommend that you do not buy this. Buy the CNN's War Report album now that is real rap."
2,G-Unit's New CD Is.............Not Da Bomb,"50 must have used up all the good songs on G.R.O.D.T. (Get Rich Or Die Tryin)G-Unit has great potential, but this cd just SUCKS. The Best songs on there (Stunt 101, Salute U, Beg For Mercy, G'D Up, Lay You Down, & Gangsta Sh*t) are just mediocre tracks. This is a cd that is selling due to name sake. I think part of the problem is the fact that this cd WASN'T produced by Shady/Aftermath. I mean, GRODT was one of 2003's best. This album is crap. If you like slow songs, this is your album. I bought this cd because I'm a die hard 50/G-Unit fan. But Truthfully, unless you're a diehard G-Unit fan, this cd isn't worth the $20."
1,Fake @ss thugs,"Sorry 50 fans. G-units' Beg for Mercy is pure sh*t. It hadawful subject matter, tired beats, and bad lyricism from 50 and Young Buck. The only reason this gets one star is because there is only one star. And thats Lloyd Banks. This boy needs to leave and start a solo career. His use of metaphor is witty and insightful. The nerve of 50 bit*h to say this album is gonna sell more than Hovito. Bullsh*t walter!"
3,Its iight but not great,"My homie bought this cd, we had been anticipating it fo' awhile. But i gotta say that this cd isn't as good as we thought it woulda been. Lloyd banks is on fire as usual (his wordplay is jus crazy) but tha rest o' tha cd isn't that good. My buddy was pretty good. Jus wanna get to know you was good, but overal its jus a iight cd not good not great, but not horrible1KeE http://www.soundclick.com/bands/9/keemusic.htm"
1,Y'all call this gangsta?????WTF happened to y'all?,"50's debut album was 10 times better than this album. i don't know wtf got into him makin an album like this cuz it couldn't have been worse. The only thing he like 2 talk bout is gunz, gunz, and death. even the title of the album is wack ""beg for mercy"" :)) he's the one that needs 2 beg 4 mercy not tha fans cuz if the fans don't buy his record he ain't gon be that popular any mo'. Let's face it the album is pretty average. Bottom line : Don't even spend ur money on this piece of s**t cuz it ain't worth it."
2,Not impressed....,"I expected greatness from this CD and all I got was mediocrity. I was countin down the days until this thing was released along with the new Jay-Z joint and once I heard them both, I was definitely feelin the Jay and gettin nothing from this one. I recommend gettin the Black Album instead, G-Unit could've done much better..."
1,Only Two Good Songs...,"There are only two good songs on this album and ironically their both ""SOFT""; The same exact reason 50 was dissing Ja.""I wanna get to know you"" and ""Smile""The rest suck."
1,One Long Drip Of Molasses,"Everytime I try to get into this album I do one of three things: 1. Fall Asleep 2. Get Bored and turn it off 3. Fall asleep.This album is very frustrating considering the greatness of Get Rich Or Die Trying. This album is very BLAH BLAH. None of their voices are great things; all monotone and sleep inducing. The beats are horrible; slow and tiring, and to top it off each beat sounds similar...The album is WAY WAY too long. The hooks to the songs are horrible and they mumble too much. Banks and 50 sound as if they're on their death bed when they rap in those long low soft voices that put you to sleep. The album has no funk, no groove, no nothing. It's just there collecting dust. Granted there are a FEW songs worth listening to such as 'Wanna Get To Know You' and the two singles but not enough to warrant a purchase. 1.5 Stars."
1,"The only redeeming songs on this album are, as follows:","1) ""Groupie Love""--better than ""Stunt 101"" as a single2) ""I Smell Pussy""--Is that you Irv? Is that you Ja? (the catchy intro from the song, mostly about getting booty)Otherwise, 50's choruses sound lazier than the ones found on Get Rich or Die Tryin'. And lyrically, G-Unit is very disappointing. Here's hoping they ""Free Yayo"" and make a better follow-up."
1,Basic @ Best...,"I like G-Unit, and 50, even though Lloyd Banks is the best rapper of the combined 3, you can't tell from this album. Half the time u can't hear what the dude is saying (sounds like he got a loaf of bread in his mouth). Young Buck, got the same ""I'm Hard"" rapstyle though the whole album. 50, he ain't doing nothing special to show he is the leader of the crew, besides, being the executive producer. They tricked the public on this, this only did what it did, because of the strength of ""Get Rich or Die Tryin,'"" the majority of this CD is old mix tape stuff anyway. The only song that I like was ""I Smell P****,"" and that song is 2 years old. G-Unit, got one over on ya'll with this one, I can't wait 'till Yayo gets out, maybe they will put out a better album."
4,banks is better,"banks is better....him and cassidy got the hottest punchlines in the rap game right now...young buck is trash cuz hes from teh south and all southern rappers cant rap....dont hate on 50 cuz he gettin his checks, he doesnt care bout what he puts out now, cuz everybody is buyin his albums regardless"
2,Weak attempt,"It's seems to me that 50 cent doesn't care anymore,he's rich and famous and doesn't have to make good albums to sell, and he knows it,which would explain how weak he came here"
4,Not bad!!,"The first thing i noticed was that how many reviews are only 1,2 or 3 stars! Beg for mercy is definetly not below 4 out of 5 stars!Now about the album! CD starts of with a great song G-unit! Great beats ad lyrics! Then kind of weak down from 2-5!After track 5 rest of the Album is full of nice songs! Can't skip one of them!Buy it. The artwork have 3 or 4 pictures which are very good!"
3,Tha Real,get rich or die tryin aint all that greatthis ones betterby tha way - yayo is in the pen homie
1,BUY IT,"DISH IS A FUNTASHTIC ALBUM. DRUGS, GIRLS, AND MONEY IT SHAYS ALL BOUT DAT, SO GO AHEAD AND BUY THIS P**P'S ALBUM."
1,Boring...I want my 12 dollars back!,"This album sucks. The beats are so ridiculous. They just threw some instrumentals together to rap on. If there are not tight beats, then I'm turned off by lyrics. This album deserves -10. Don't waste your money and don't waste a blank cd. It's cheaper than blank tape."
2,What did you expect?,"Were you expecting anything other than songs about guns, violence and killing people? This cd is selling on association just because 50 cent said ""G-Unit"" a bunch of times in his horrid album. I've heard some cuts on this and the constant gun talk is extremely monotonous. They couldn't have picked a worse single in ""Stunt 101"". How much longer are they going to beat this dead horse? Look elsewhere if you want some quality in your music. Preferably The Black Album by Jigga where FINALLY somebody decides to expose 50 cent for the disgusting emcee that he is. And when I say emcee, i used that term loosely."
2,50 Cent + 2 MS and still short of a dollar!!,"In my opinion, the G-Unit sounds exactly like what P-Diddy tried to creat one his MTV Special Making The Band. They sound like they were forced to rush this album before 50's flame was blown out by the next hot MC of 5004. This album is not good at all; I mean all those songs and nothing even comes close to his worst song on his major debut. 50 is better as a solo artist and should be banned from doing collaborations with anyone other than Eminem or Dre."
1,Beg for Mercy,"WOW this sh*t is weak!!!! with the exeption of a couple good tracks this cd is garbage. Get ritch or die try'n was great cd but this is pathitic. Hearing 50 cent claim to be number 1 over and over again made me sick. well iam gone keep this short cuz i have better stuff to do. Save your money, pick up Jay z the black album or andre nickatina conversation with a devil those are worthy of your hard earned money."
2,BOOOORING,"Most of what needs to be said about this album has already been said. It's boring.But the real reason I posted this is cause another reviewer said they say them performing live and was ""amazed"". What the hell? Fifty has the worst stage presence of anyone except maybe Jay-Z. He can't rap live for shhh, wheezing and sounding, well, uh retarded, but thats the same in his studio rap.I can't wait until white america stops wanting to see black people kill each other and be ignorant, because as long as thats what they want, thats what mainstream will give them."
2,G unit is not 50 Cent,"Despite his effort an his solo released record beg for mercy is not 50 cent best work. If i have a team of 50 cent, lloyd banks and young buck with dr dre making the beats i think he will come out to be an amazing record. But its not. This record was done to fast 50 really doesn t flow like he used to and young buck yells too much. Despite all that its all cool record with track like lay you down and poppin them thangs shows you that 50 still got his musicality. But other than that nothing new. But I hope 50 comes back with a better creative record nest time he goes solo lets just hope he will be able to keep track with the music industry and the rap game !!!"
1,dont buy unless something in your house is unlevel,the cd is weak it goes to prove 50 cant make good music without spiting about ja this new stuff sounds like fake cash money i teach u how to stunt fake stuff
1,This is getting old,"See, Nas was right about this. If you didn't listen to him on the radio, you missed out a lot. Black people have been oppressed by other groups because of the stereotypes. The G-unit has always portrayed negativity and constantly bashing Ja Rule. Believe it or not, Nas made several diss records at them because they did nothing for hip hop. They are hypocrites because they make (horrible) love songs at this CD. Don't worry, they will be buried by Nas and Eminem (he actually hates G-Unit now). p.s: Lloyd Banks stole $800 from charity on 12/23/03 and got charged for robbery. Pity him"
1,Garbage,I can't stand 50 'mumbles' Cent therefore this album blows. The other dudettes don't sound good either.Keep up the crap work!!! -thumbs down-
1,gggg gun-it,"This album is just lazy garbage. Beat are boring, thier flows are tired, and the lyrics are the same thing you hear in all popular rap, only less clever. Go buy some old wu-tang or something!"
4,its the SH**,"ok first of all, this album isnt GET RICH OR DIE TRYING but it is pretty damn good compared to the other crap out there...songs like ""my buddy"", ""smile"", ""groupie love"" among others are very good tracks. The album is a very solid debut for GUNIT, lloyd banks is a great lyricist led by 50 and even young buck (who suprised me) lends some very good vocals.not a classic but one for your collection definetly."
2,WORST SH*T EVER,"I recently got this album and it has already found its way do the bottom of my trash can. Not only are the beats lame but so is the rapping by all of fifty, lloyd, young buck and the minor appearances by Yayo. Get some diversification instead of handing down 18 tracks about guns and money. Also whats with this thug in love sh*t. The tracks smile and wanna get to know you are pathetic and would probably heard at a retards convention. Fifties Get Rich or Die Tryin' is damn good and this g unit album is no comparison. It just goes to show you that dre and eminem who produced get rich or die tryin' were the real people behind the albums success while Beg For Mercy which is produced by Fifty clearly shows that he has no talent at all. If you want to get a real album than i suggest u get Devils Night by D12."
5,Nice doll,"I bought this doll for my daughter because she loves the video and this doll shares her name. She has received more of the dolls from the video and enjoys playing with all of them. Not educational, per se, but it adds to her imagination. She loves the dresses that all of the dolls have, and she likes to have a ""Princess"" Ashlyn doll."
1,"You have got to be kidding, Don't buy from them.","I bought this product new, it arrived not only used but with a previous invoice inside the book. How much more obvious can someone make it to say we are going to screw you over real good. I send them a nice note and explain that the book is not onlyused but has some wear on it and would they refund me 20.00 off the price I paid. I paid 69. and some change for the book. They never even answered my email. I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN. I filed a complaint with amazon about them."
3,BioInquiry Textbook,"The text did arrive in a timely manner and it was wrapped in plastic. The product was supposed to be new, but the outside of the book was scuffed up and some of the pages were bent, along with the cover of the book. The book could have been in better condition for one that is new. In spite of this, the product was in pretty decent shape and I would probably order from this supplier again."
3,How can you rate a required text book,"This book was required for a class. It's not a good book, it's theory taught as fact. Typical Public Education Science..."
5,Changed my Life,"I am now 45 years old and feel as good as I did in college.5 years ago I felt like I was falling apart, I was getting more immobile every year and was having trouble sleeping due to extremely tight muscles especially in my neck, back and shoulders. My entire body from head to toe was tight, stiff and sore. Luckily 5 years ago I discovered this book and have used the techniques discussed in this book ever since. It took a long time and lots of patience but the results are nothing less than miraculous. Using this technique along with daily stretching I am no longer stiff or sore; I can run, play on the floor with my kids, and sleep again. This book truly has changed the course of my life."
4,A pleasant discovery,This is another of the fine jazz performers whose work we are only now discovering by scanning liner notes for names and looking on Amazon.com. This is a disk we will keep for a long time.
2,Too Much Trouble,"I purchased the iPod nano armband carrier to use while working out. However, I have yet to use it. It is hard to slide the iPod into the carrier, and even harder to get it back out. Additionally, it is hard to turn the click wheel once in the carrier. I suppose the snug fit is good for working out, however, it is just too much trouble afterwards."
1,Missing Ipod Carrier,It has been close to a month and I still haven't recieved my purchase. I won't purchase again from this vendor.
3,"Keeps nano safe, not convenient","This ipod nano case does what it's supposed to - keeps the nano safe and protected from dust/sweat/etc. However, you can't detach the case part from the armband, so if you use your ipod for more than just working out, like me, it's pretty inconvenient to have the armband part attached. I ended up just buying one of the silicone cases with a detachable armband and lanyard and that's worked pretty well so far."
3,Plastic Cover Too Thick,"The product does a good job of protecting the iPod but the plastic on the front cover is so thick it makes using the wheel difficult. When running I usually have to stop, or at least slow down, to make any adjustments.I realize it's a trade-off in that if the plastic isn't there there is the opportunity for it to scratch but if you use it for running like me the risk is low and you'll be happier with something that doesn't cover the wheel."
5,I love this album.,"I love this album. I first heard it in Puerto Vallarta while hanging out around the swimming pool at a small hotel. Every day I had the pool to myself and the hotel bartender would play this album, while telling me about Lola Beltran. She is at her peak in this live concert in Mexico City. The concert is a mutual love affair between Lola and her audience. Lola Beltran makes even old standards like Cielito Lindo seem fresh and moving. After several years, this is still one of my favorite mariachi albums."
3,These are not the extreme white bulbs thay are standard H3 85 watt bulbs,"The bulbs are not as described, they are PIAA old stock and are not the xtreme white plus bulbs, they are standard 85 watt H3 bulbs no coating."
5,Perfect representation of Korean tragedy,"Those who study, or have lived in, Korea will appreciate the dynamism and importance of this impeccably made film. Outside of a passing awareness most Americans have no idea what the split nations of south and north Korea mean. This film captures, in a slowly building awareness, the true tragedy and heart break that is the modern Korean nation: one racially, ethnically and culturally monolithic people harshly divided in two with one the last vestige of a dead socioeconomic theory (communism) and the other a raging Asian Tiger and the world's 11th largest economy. While the north has clearly lost this last stand off of the Cold War, the nations remain divided and JSA does a superb job of bringing this into the human dimension. Note the subtle jabs at the US as well as the neutral nations. This gives Americans a view into a world most do not understand, but one that could consume our military in a flash. Not to be missed."
3,"A great movie, a questionnable transfer.","It's been said earlier, but I can only confirm. On a technical note, this DVD is less than great. For instance, although it's double-layered, what is really encoded is the whole 4:3 screen, not just the 16:9 section. That means, say, half of the DVD holds data for black bars. And to top it off, it's interlaced source, not progressive.I haven't seen the Korean DVD but it's hard not to beat this one. Plus if indeed it does hold more extras, I'd say one should seriously consider looking for that version and skip this one.So, Movie: 5 stars + DVD: 2 stars = Overall: 3 stars."
4,Unknown hero,"The Navy life of Captain Frederic Walker has been well described. Through this book you can feel en relive his unbending and relentless approach to anti-submarine warfare during the battle of the Atlantic. Anybody interested in ASW should read this book. It is also a great narritive of a too short life of an outstanding RN officer.L.Bruin, CDRE"
3,D. from Stockbridge,The ring is pretty but very flexible which turned out good for me because I ordered for my ring finger and the size of it made it look better as a pinkie ring.
5,Awesome!!,I Loved this movie... then again I Love South Park.It arrived before I thought it would....
4,South Park DVD,Some of my family members enjoy South Park. This is the Christmas DVD. They seem to enjoy it. It is one that they had seen on TV during the holiday season.
1,Of questionable taste...,"""Hankie the Christmas Poo"" is EXACTLY what the name suggests. The use of an animated turd (it even leaves brown smudges behind) as a Christmas icon may seem amusing to some, but I do not share this sentiment."
5,Christmas isn't Christmas without South Park,"If you are easily offended, do not buy this product. Uptight, in any way? Buy something else. If the word ""poop"" makes you ill, do not click on ""add to cart"". NOW... If you have a sick sense of humor and like laughing out loud at disgusting behavior, bad language, and naughty attitudes... THIS IS THE DVD FOR YOU! Welcome to one of the funnier animated classics of the now generation. There are moments that everyone in my family was laughing so hard that we had to hit playback just to see & hear what Cartman said!"
4,"Review of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob by Jules Seletz","This historical fiction book was very good. I learned a lot- it supplemented the basic understanding I had of U.S. and world history. It was filled with golden nuggets of trivia, for example , statistics on WWI and WWII casualties. It revealed the thread of continuity from WWI to WWII, and gave a broad picture of how Nazism took over. All this plus the personal story of a Russian Jewish immigrant, Abe Stein, whose son Jacob becomes the main character in the latter half of the book. Jake,s teen-age years and experiences are honestly portrayed, including some brushes with the same Anti-Semitism his father and grandfather had encountered."
5,'Jekyll & Hyde Resurrection' Rocks,"Jekyll and Hyde the Musical has been recorded umpteen times in the US and abroad. If you're a fan of the stage show, you know why. The music is simply riveting. The stage show is often referred to as a pop musical, but this new recording makes it easy to imagine the show as a bonafied rock opera. Whether you're a fan of the show or not, 'Jekyll & Hyde Resurrection' provides a listening experience any music lover can thoroughly enjoy. This version takes the piece to new and exciting places, where we get to hear some new and unbelievably talented musicians. Not only do the three leads sing the snot out of the score, but also we are treated to some amazing individuals who stand out playing the electric guitar, violin, cello and percussion. Kudos to the creative team for their vision and for their production values. Awesome!"
4,An interesting change,When I bought this CD I've only hard 30 seconds of each song. I can say it is wonderful. The new orchestration gives to the music an interesting evolution that I didn't suspected. I enjoyed it till the last minute. One small problem is that in some moments the guitars exceed from their utility in the solos
4,Very nice re-orchestration,A very nice re-orchestration of the musical that has seen many-many revisions. I especially enjoed the many electric guitar riffs.
1,not so hot,"I listened to it once and went back to the broadway cast album. I was disappointed because I did see Rob Evans on Broadway in J&H (He was so good you wanted to hide under your seat!) but this CD is a little too heavy on the electric guitars. Overall, I gave it a chance but would have been better off saving the money."
5,A Resurrection Indeed,"Having been a fan of Frank Wildhorn's musical ""Jekyll & Hyde"" for years, I have several CD versions of it. Believing ""Resurrection"" would be so similar to my other CDs, with the exception of the performers, I at first was hesitent to purchase it. To my complete surprise this version is so different, it has become my favorite J&H CD. ""Resurrection"" is J&H with a rock edge. It's refreshing, stunning and exciting to listen to. Rob Evan's is a powerful and dynamic Jekyll. The female leads of Brandi Burkhardt and Kate Shindle make this CD such a joy to listen to. An added bonus is a new song for ""Emma"" (Burkhardt)called ""If You Only Knew"". Fans of J&H along with those who love Broadway musicals cannot go wrong with this latest and best version from Frank Wildhorn."
3,Did we need ANOTHER Jekyll & Hyde recording...,"...probably not -Here is a show and a score that keeps evolving and changing. While the creative process is always interesting to observe - this animal is as Schizophrenic as Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Somethings on this new recording are interesting, but none of the leads on this are better than Linda Eder or the various other actors on the other recordings. The different orchestrations/interpretations are neat to hear - but the production values are so so at best.But what's the goal here? They went from a concept album - complete work - broadway album back to another ""concept"" album (at best)The next recording should be ""The Complete Symphonic Recording of Jekyll and Hyde"""
5,"Nice message, good illustrations","I came across this story - but by a different illustrator and went looking for a copy. I'm glad I found this more Jewish version. It's a great story with a wonderful message for my two boys to hear. Although I'm not Jewish, my husband is, and I like the Yiddish flavor of the text and pictures."
4,"Love Thy Brother, As Thyself","Good for 4-8 yrs. The story is about two brothers, Yankel and Josef who shared, and worked together on a farm. Then hard times visit the two farm brothers when a drought hits. Both brothers, in need of food, worry more about the other brother's welfare. All turns out well in the end, and we're all better for having read this story!This is a truely excellent story for children. The book only has one flaw, but it can be a big one with children. The illustrations are rather primitive, and don't seem to really capture the essence of the wonderful text. But the story is so good, it overshadows this flaw. Such a great message for children!"
3,"Worth Considering, But Not to Be Taken Completely","Muggeridge is right about the bias of the secular establishment. Media and educational institutions attack Christianity on a regular basis. The weakness is in Muggeridge's theological explanations. In some areas he's simply wrong. So one can take this book as a defense of the faith from one who means well, but is uninformed.Muggeridge sees Western civilization being underminded in that as Christianity is removed from the public square, evil replaces it and fills the void with the exact opposite of what was handed down from previous generations. He has some excellent thoughts on giving one's self to the work at hand."
3,Put some tape over Clue's mouth,"Sure, DJ Clue has tons of guest stars and ""everyone"" should cop this album since anyone who's anyone is on this disc. BUT when he talks over the beat, it's annoying as Richard Simmons. Someone should really release a diss record about Clue. Only problem is that every rapper in the world has been on his discs.......oh well. Upcoming rappers: keep this in mind. Take your tracks to Funkmaster Flex. He just talks at the beginning and the end. Oh yeah, about this album: no one gives dap to the rapper with the illest lyrics on this joint. His name is Canibus, and he deserves more credit than ""90 percent of you rappers out there."" Speaking of the man who wrote that line, Canibus is the only one to diss Eminem (""U Didn't Care"", among many) and leave him practically speachless. Think about that..."
1,EXCLUSIVE !!!,"EXCLUSIVE!!I bought this CD thinking that i was going to get a great hip hop mix. I was amazed at the number of great songs listed in the back. When i put the CD in I almost died! The songs aren't mixed together well at all, his voice is dubbed over at a higher level than the music, and he claims that the songs are ""EXCLUSIVE!!""The only thing that is exclusive about this CD is his RIDICULOUS voice, and his naieve mentality about being the best DJ in the world. (...)"
3,Wallowing through the Meier.,"This video tells the story of Pleidian contactee Billy Meier, which is somewhat interesting if you can get past the poor film quality. If you have a short attention span then this two-cassette VHS is not for you. There are some informational gems here and there, but it takes quite a bit of patience to watch it all the way through. The videographer should have taken a class in storytelling before attempting this one."
3,"Fun, ""flicker"" cover and a few good Bettie Page tunes","...one more for your Bettie Page collection of stuff. Nice rockin' numbers though not too long or heavy on content.I'd LIKE to see a real collection of Bettie tunes: there are plenty more, but here's a cool CD to start with."
3,Great ring...but,"I really liked this ring, but I should have ordered one size up from the one I did and it turned my finger green. It also would get caught on things. I wish that it had been all one small braid. On the positive side, I did get a lot of compliments on it."
1,Description is Very Inaccurate,"The description does not match photos or model number.The description for this item claims more than 2,000 tie points etc., while the picture and the model number (Elenco 9880WK) are for a board that has 830 tie points."
4,This book is interesting and sad.,"I have been reading spooksville from the beginning and am very happy with the series, although this one was a little disapointing. dont get me wrong, it was a good storyline, but the death of the orriginal watch was very sad and dissapointing to read since him and sally are my favorite characters. you may think im to old to read these books but i read steven king and anne rice too, i just like to read and share the books with my younger brother and sister."
4,slow heavy and bluesy rock,"Bill ward scored a big hit with me on his first album 'Along the way' by creating a different sound from his Black Sabbath days, while still keeping a hard edge. Not heavy metal, but more a harder version of Pink floyd. This new album dosent sound as fresh, but it still rates highly with excellent production and songs that are thoughtfull and bring to mind the Never say die album from sabbaths old days."
5,Power of the Mexican Guitar,"I had never heard of Los Poetas. So sad that there is very little information on the cd cover to tell us a little about the artists that played these pieces. If you like Bibriesca,if you enjoy traditional Mexican pieces, if your acoustic oriented, and if you can connect to so many of these Mexican classics, you will enjoy every single track in this album. I have heard Mexican music all my life,and I can honestly say this album is one of the best. There is not one bad piece on either cd! I have recommended it to so many of my friends. One can only hope that there will be a follow up to this marvelous piece of work!"
5,Stunning Throughout,"As AH fans know, he has disowned several semi-bootleg albums, like Velvet Darkness (even this has some exqusite accoustic guitar but I digress)but this live disc is wonderful. Although he would disagree, the truth is he just can't play badly. Diehard fans should look for the laserdisc which appears to be from the same show, on another night."
5,Wonderful,"From Rock & Roll to the ballads to the Disney covers & ""silly songs"", it's an incredible, solid gold album. The sing-a-long qualities are always there with Rolf Harris.Rolf Harris Enterprises has come up with another classic that is enjoyable for the entire family.The way the songs flow from upbeat to slow gospel style songs is almost as amazing as the songs themselves.Thank you Rolf - you've come through again!!!"
2,Not What I expected.,"I chose this selection because of a review I read in a book from Amazon re: album cover art. While the cover art was nice the music didn't quite meet the review. Not bad, just wasn't what I was expecting."
4,"Great product, wrong color","I love the machine, it is everything it promises it to be, but for the color: the reformer turned up in black rather than as pictured in off-white. I was specifically looking for something less intrusive in my white loft. I wish the seller specified the color as black, rather than just giving a false image on all websites. The machine has a very distinct unpleasant smell, which I hoped would disappear by now, however after a few weeks it is there and it is still strong, but that should go away, the color stays...The reason I did not even consider sending it back was that the box is absolutely huge and heavy and the delivery person was really struggling with getting it off the truck as there was no indication in the shipping instruction that he needed any specific equipment/help.As for the Pilates experience, it is a great machine, very smooth and flexible, I particularly like that it has 5th spring which allows to further customize workout."
2,"Nice try, really straining for some notes,","Buy ""Loud and Proud"". Do not buy this CD, it is painful to listen to sometimes. A few good cuts, but McCaffery is straining. Band is hot, singer not. Buy Loud and Proud. Then you will enjoy Nazareth at their finest hour!"
5,AS NAZ AS EVER!,"If you get a chance to see Nazareth live do so.If you like Naz buy this recording!""It is wall to wall on Wall Street"" and the best investment advice I have for anyone out there is to buy this recording.I often prattle on to long in my reviews. I have to words for this exclent Naz--buy it! Wait three words--buy it now!Bias warning: I'm on a big UFO binge and this is the only non-UFO making it into the player at this time. How can anybody not like Naz?"
1,do not purchase,"taken from tv and was never edited, you see tracking being done, the channel it was being taped from-etc. quality is so poor that if you watch it, you'll never watch it again"
2,Deorganized video,"I just bought this one because it was on sale. I do not recommend it because it is VERY deorganized in all aspects of the video. There are many minutes without explanation, there is not a ""script"" or something. Sometimes you don't know what they are talking about, and I gopt sick of seeing all the times the same footage without comments nor explanation.Don't waste your money. It is not worth it.Regards, Alex"
3,I have seen better,"The video Air Disasters is not bad for the price, however the more serious Aviation Enthusiast will catch the subtle factual errors through out video. There is good footage though, some I have not seen before. If I may reccomend the Survival in the Skies video box set also offered here at Amazon.com as an addition or alternative choice. This video series produced by TLC is rather accurate and very imformative!!"
2,Brit Pomposity at its...er...Worst,"Lots of dramatic images, just watch it muted. The narrative is merely one long whine, and more often than not misstates details. Shows numerous clips with no explanation or description given. VERY short on details, long on opinion."
3,Use Caution When ordering - Crosslinked!,"When ordering this title use caution or you may end up with either one of the following titles:Corpus Delecti: Best of Corpus Delecti [Audio CD]Tubalcain: 25 Assorted Needles [Audio CD]Apparently these two titles are crossed linked together here on Amazon. Although they are both great albums... it does create a bit of confusion for both the seller & the customer. Before purchasing, it would be wise to inquire as to what title the marketplace seller is offering. They may not be aware of this issue because most sellers list their product by UPC [741157023329]."
3,"Typical shadowrun novel, But not half bad","this novel was all right...for a shadowrun book, but other than that it wasn't particulary that good. The writing was very bland. The characters were poorly underdeveloped and the story was slow. The author needs to develop the characters more and put a lot more description in the overall story, The introduction of a new dragon was pretty cool and also the involvement of Lowfry which is a character not written about to often in the shadowrun universe. The books in the shadowrun universe need to be better written. All the books seem to follow a trend of having the same plot outline. I would like to see more effort be put into shadowrun books. This book was not bad though. It was a good read although it was like reading a manual. The author did a descent job of it, just needs to work more on character development and overall plot."
4,Simple and sweet,"Saint Tail isn't going to win any awards for ground-breaking plot, but if you're looking for a sweet story, look no further. Each chapter has Meimi, the main character, performing a theft as Saint Tail. However, she never steals without reason, and after the theft, everyone is happier. Her life is complicated by a schoolmate, Asuka Jr., who is determined to catch the mysterious thief.Also in this volume are two short stories. One is a take off of ""The Little Mermaid,"" the other a story about using magic to win a love.The translation for this volume is very smooth, allowing the characters to retain their little idiosyncrasies. In all, this is a wonderful example of shojo manga (girls' comic) that can be enjoyed by all ages."
1,Hilarious and Sweet!(NOT),"I'm sorry but this is probably the stupidest manga I have ever read in my entire life (13 years) first off the drawings are terrible, you can't tell if the object is a boy a girl or possibly an egg-salad sandwich, literrally. Next, the plot crawls along so slowly it takes half the book to get one point across also it is SO DARN PREDICTIBLE!!! Everything that happaned i already knew it would happen and i'm actually not that bright. So anywasy my main point is I would obviously not recommend buying this. All the jolks the main characters try and make are just plain stupid. This manga is about a girl who steals from people so she can give whatever she steals to the poor. Another thing that really drives me crazy is her stupid nun friend, yes I know a nun- Enough said."
1,Description misleading,"The cream is wonderful, but the description on Amazon is misleading. The description reads 2/3oz which seems to indicate you will receive two tubes of the 3oz cream with each order, but you only receive one tube."
2,Fallen or Flopped?,"Well this doesn't appear to be a very popular book, or else readers weren't interested enough to write a review. I would have to agree more closely with reviewer #2. The book was very slow and skipped around so many characters it was difficult to keep them straight. It's a wonder, Gerald,Paul/Frank could keep his story straight he told so many lies. He must have had some talent tho' to be hired by 2 different Universities and didn't seem to lack money, dressed nicely, drove a BMW, etc. The story does make one stop and think tho' about the effort a twisted mind goes to to pull off the subterfuge he did."
1,He is no kung fu master,"This movie was seriously the worst movie i have ever seen. Well not exactly i didn't see all of it because it was too lame so i turned it off. I love kung fu movie too so thats not the reason i have a collection of a bunch of new and old kung fu movies. And i like donnie Yen in Hero (jet li) and iron monkey, but in this movie he was unlikeable. The main thing that made this movie bad was the fighting it was bad it was chopy and way too excelerated. It was nothing like Once Upon a time in China, or Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or Hero. It wasnt like Jackie chan style or Like Fists of legend it was just bad.Acting-DCoreography-DFighting-CAll Around-DIf you liked any of the other movie i named you wont like this one."
2,ah come on mr. director..,"i love donnie yen on iron monkey and once upon a time in china 2, so i decided to buy this movie expecting a raw good kung fu action. However, I ended having a a huge dissapointment on the film because the action are being fast forward in purpose so that it will look like they are fighting rapidly. I would have continue watching the film if the director would just left the action scene the way it was without fast forwarding it. The action lost its rawness; therefore, about 20 minutes later of the film i stop watching it. This film is about the fourth time in a row that I wasted my money with kung fu movies such as the last duel, deadful melody and the leg fighters. I need to be more cautios next time =("
4,Not For Everyone,"While this film is definitley a must for all Kung Fu Junkies out there, it may be a little hard to swallow for the average person. Donnie Yen Is Incredible, and this movie does produce some great fight scenes, However, the Production, direction, and several other aspects leave so much to be desired that its actually distracting from the movie.Much Love though to Donnie Yen and all the other great Martial Artists who contributed."
2,One of the bad movies starring Donnie Yen.,"The costumes and settings reveal this movie's shoestring budget. The fighing scenes are below par compared with other good films starring Donnie. The acting and the plot are not intersting either. This is more like a bad TV show than a movie. Donnie's famous for his kung fu skills. You should see Iron Monkey, Hero, Butterfly sword, Once upon a time in China 2 and Blade 2 to appreciate how good he is.It's still worth renting to satisfy your curiosity."
3,"Fun surface entertainment...then, immediately and completely forgettable","This wins honors for doing as much with a 30-minute segment as any retro chic secret agent thriller can. But while fast action, variegated plots and European settings are all to its credit, its improbability and inability to develop depth of any kind relegates it to something recommended primarily for aficionados of Man from UNCLE or of Robert Vaughn. Others seeking spy or crime thrillers might look to other items I have reviewed, either American or British."
3,Half-hour format hobbles international espionage series.,"Generally speaking, if you enjoy British spy shows like ""The Saint"" and ""The Avengers"", you will probably enjoy this series. However, the 30 minute format of the series precludes any significant character or plot development, and ultimately results in a less than satisfying result. There are a few stories which extend to two episodes, but they are so few that they do not make up for the limited development of the other episodes in the series.I'd suggest sticking with the one hour format shows."
5,Post U.N.C.L.E.,"After the cancellation of THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. and appearences in some successful films (most notably the McQueen epic BULLET), Gerry & Sylvia Anderson inticed Robert Vaughn to return to the small screen in a 30 minute action-adventure series. As Harry Rule he runs a small security service that takes on special cases. Carried in syndication in the U.S. in the early 1970's, it was a pretty decent show that was to capture in 30 minutes the excitement of shows twice as long. A difficult relationship between Vaughn and the Andersons brought this show to a close after only 2 seasons. Sadly both Nyree Dawn Porter and Tony Anholt have passed away in the intervening years. Vaughn can currently be seen in the British series HUSTLE."
5,Robert Vaughn was cool!!!!!,"I forgot about this series. I saw on public channel in reruns.I didn't remember until I saw it on Spy Series Dvd Collection.This show is cool! Shows are 30 minutes. They move fast andfurious. They are exciting, well written, Cool and fun! I lovethis series. I recommend anyone who love cool spy mystery shows.Robert Vaughn was the man from uncle but here he's man from cool!"
2,item sold not as a full set,"Received order for season one of the Protectors. Shipment should have a total of four dvd's, only received one. Description should state that there are multiply volumes in each season."
3,3 STARS,"I have purchased this book on instrumentation and controls . It is written by a guy who worked in UK in the field of instrumentation and controls . While the book has some good information on instrumentation and controls , it is pretty short . It does provide some good practical and useful knowledge to engineers but the information is not extensive . From the length of the book , I am sure you will have a rough idea of what to expect . May I suggest to anyone interested in buying a good practical hands-on book on instrumentation to try out the book on Instrumentation by American Technical Publishers(627 pages) . However , this book is cheap and if you are looking for a lowprice book , then maybe this is ok for you . I would had I known spent more money on buying a good book than spend less money on buying a bad book ."
2,Disappointing,"I found a great many of the stories not appropriate for children. They either ended in some horrific way, that would scare the average child, (my children are 3, 6 & 8) or they were disjointed, the beginning and the end, did not even seem to match. I found myself having to re-write the endings in telling the stories.The Biography, Slavery and History chapters were informative, but still did not compensate for the other stories. I would not purchase this book again."
4,Great culturally rich stories,"We (my 3 and 7 yr old) borrowed this from the library because I wanted to share with them stories from our culture. Some stories are too complex for their age but alot of them they understand; especially after we have our discussions after reading. I enjoyed reading as much as they enjoyed listening. This is a book to have as part of your library, because of the more complex stories. This book even has biographies of African Americans inventors and scientist that my mother and I had never heard of. The only thing I wish is that it could have more pictures."
2,Disappointed,"I was expecting much more, more hands on, etc. And I was looking for a book that would reach younger children."
2,Not as pictured,"The product image pictured is not what you will receive, no train included this is the special edition and only has some push buttons on the front of the DVD that make some sounds."
3,Henry the Elephant DVD Thomas and Friends,This DVD was purchased for my four year old son as a Christmas gift. He was very excited to open it up because he loves anything Thomas. The movie was described accurately by the product description and was priced very reasonably. I would have given it five stars except compared to the other Thomas movies my son has this one didn't seem to keep his attention as much.
1,Bait and Switch!,I purchased this dvd specifically for Toby the Train pictured with the DVD. I was surprised when the train didn't come with the dvd so I called customer service and they refused to send Toby stating the description didn't mention a train although the picture clearly shows Toby on top of the dvd.
4,Not what I expected,"This is a great compulation. All the remixes are done very well, Without destroying the oreginal artist work, as many remixes do. If your an industrial fan, this is a must have."
5,Love this pack and play!,"AMAZING!! Exactly what we were looking for; bendy and discrete enough for packing, and stands firm for play. If you want some great information on packing cocks and a great review of this and other pack and players visit the sugarbutch chronicles, Sinclair sexmith's web sight. He's got lots of great info about packing, and does some product reviews on his 'packing cocks 101' post. You should know that Sinclair's sight contains BDSM, kink, gender explorations, and explicit queer sex."
2,Missing imprint,Missing imprint of 14K (the #4 is not legible on either metal). Do not know if these metals are actually 14 carat gold.
2,14K GOLD CHARM,THEY SHOW THIS PRODUCT LARGER THAN IT ACTUALLY IS. IT'S EMBARRASSING BECAUSE IT'S THINNER THAN A RAZOR BLADE. I KNOW GOLD IS EXPENSIVE BUT I'D RATHER PAY ANOTHER $100. TO GET SOMETHING YOUR NOT GOING TO CUT YOURSELF WITH . CRAFTSMANSHIP IS VERY GOOD.
3,Check your game before you buy.,"This is not a review of the game per se, because I think the card game is really fun.I do warn you to check the version of your game before you buy this. If you already have the revised version of the original game or expansion pack, you do NOT need this."
2,Expected more,"I've always been a fan of this label, i have all the frequent flyer cd's but this one is a little boring for me, because it's the same rythm over and over and also in other cd's from this series cd1 was dedicated to dinner and cd2 to party specifying for instance caipirihna evenings and cafezinho afternoons on the brazil edition, this one has no difference among cd's and the compilation it's not that original i'm a little disapointed about it."
5,Journal of the Unknown Prophet,"This was a wonderful book. It was very well written. You could feel the deep love the father has for his people. This book was more than just a telling of future events. The chapter about the great falling away was riviting. You realise the need you have to be very close to the Lord in these last days. Of all the books I've read, this is one of my favorites. It made an impact on my life."
5,Amazing!!,This book is life changing. It is from the heart of God and it draws us all closer as we sense His love for mankind. I recommend it for the believer as well as an unbeliever.
1,journal of the FALSE prophet,"On page 84, Ms. Alec writes, ""For the Word alone is yesterday's manna, and even they [the teachers to whom she writes this chapter] have seen deep in their hearts that it is no longer enough to feed My people."" The Scriptures are clear that we should measure every prophet by the Word of God. We are to be gentle as doves and wise as serpents. The writings of Wendy Alec are very seductive and come so close to what we know to be truth. Close but not dead on, as the Bible requires of a true prophet. These writings tickle the ears but do not be misled. The Word of God is the Bread of Life and nothing more is required to feed God's people as Ms. Alec purports God to now be saying. This ""version of the truth"" cannot stand the test of Scripture. The Word is clear, not one word is to be added or taken away and Jesus, the Living Word is the same yesterday, today and forever. God does not change and neither does his Word. Beware this false prophet."
1,not feelin' it!,"I was curious about this book however after reading just a few chapters I was bothered by the fact it was a ""written word direct from Jesus"" because the bible is written and closed nothing is to be added or deleted from it. Maybe and that maybe is a stretch, if any other form of media had been used Youtube, radio, TV ect... it might have been more believable to me.I don't know, I can not with 100 % confidence recommend this book to anyone"
4,"""PLEASED AS PUNCH""","Journal of the Unknown ProphetI am very pleased with this product. I received it within a reasonable time. It was also in immaculate condition, totally without flaw or damage.The content is also 'out-of-sight', a must read for everyone who fears God!"
5,wendy rocks!,packed in revelation...heavy! :)Keys to Third Heaven...Using Third Heaven Revelation to Impact a WorldSeers Handbook
5,A Linguistic and Culturally Contemporary Course,"Linguistically, the most exiting language course ever published for learners of the Shoshoni Language. The course starts with Dr. Loether's refinement of the old Shoshoni orthography, then slowly begins feeding the learner into meaningful dialogs and situations, mixed with useful everyday vocabulary, grammar, and sentence drills. This course is designed for the learner to actually use the Shoshoni language, such as, at the house, the trading post, the museum, the pow-wow, or the university. The tapes are wonderfully orchestrated by fluent Drusilla Gould, who speaks very slow and thoughtfully for the learner focusing on the new sounds and words.Culturally, An Introduction to the Shoshoni Language is a window into the Shoshoni people and culture. Each chapter, in addition to the language lesson, introduces the learner to different topics and cultural situation facing the everyday Shoshoni person. At the end of each dialog, there are"
