2,poor treatment of a compelling story,"This book is a surprisingly dull and poorly written treatment of a compelling story. The author strains to make psychological insights and reconstruct events, repeating the same few bits of information over and over in an attempt to bolster his assertions. In one off-putting chapter he imagines 2 alternate scenarios that would have enabled the subjects to live in a way that is inappropriate for an ostensibly fact-based book.The prose style is inconsistent, pedestrian at best and leaden at times. The text is marred by spelling and grammatical errors that should have been corrected in copy editing. The organization of the book is poor and reinforces the impression that this is not a very well written or well thought out book. The author does not succeed in illuminating this tragic story with his mix of fact and guesswork."
3,3.5 stars actually,"kristen hersh is in a band called throwing muses. HIPS AND MAKERS is the debut solo album from the singer/songwriter. all acoustic and much more mellow than muses material, this album is powerful and personal. i love her vocie which is strong and beautiful.the music is reduced to its purest form. acoustic guitar and piano are the musical backdrops to kirsten's wonderful voice which sings lyrics more like poetry which is disconnected, introspective and disturbing but in a beautiful way. it is like reading the diary of a madman or knowing what heaven is like--things no mortal can understand. such a stark album that lights up my room when it sings. my only complaint is that at times the music seems very close to each other and all the songs sound alike. sometimes the music repeats itself and travels the same territory over and over. but all in all a worthwhile trip and worth a listen, especially for MY GHOST."
4,Interesting summary of wrecks,"This paperback is a good summary of the multitude of wrecks occurring along California's central coast. Author Reinstedt (note name misspelling above) did his homework in collecting narratives and photos (b/w) of the wrecks of many ships (and one dirigible, the Macon).I also enjoyed his chapter on ""sea monsters."" Although he states quite clearly that, ""with the lack of pictures to document the sightings, most tales of Monterey Bay monsters are scoffed at and looked upon as nothing more than nautical nightmares or the figments of someone's overactive imagination"" (p. 137), he notes that if ANYPLACE were home to such mystical creatures it would be Monterey Bay and its submarine canyons. Reinstedt included photos of ""Moore's Monster"" (a beaked whale?) and a description of Bobo the Sea Monster (a sea mammal with a growth on its head?).A rare book, and nice for the person interested in the lore of Monterey Bay."
5,Excellent Book,This is an excellent book regarding the history of shipwrecks in and around Monterey Bay and the central California Coast. I noticed it on display at Point Pinos Lighthouse. The author Randall Reinstedt obviously spent countless hours in research. It was no doubt a labor intensive task. He has a writing style that captures the moment and maintains the suspense. While the book was publish in 1975 it is the only single edition that I am aware. It would be good if Mr. Reinstedt or someone else would write a similar book form 1975 to present. I highly recommend recommend it for anyone interested in nautical history in this region.
4,Excellent spatula,"I have one of these in white and I love it. The only problem is that I like to clean it in the dishwasher, which does't take care of the gunk that gets stuck between the handle and the spatula head. Also, after over 4 years of daily use, the white plastic is becoming slightly yellowed.I want to buy another one in white (colored spatulas just look dirty to me) but can't seem to find one."
2,Be prepared to figure out most of it on your own.,Before you even get started with this CD you need to have at least a basic understanding of Visual C++ and the application framework or you're doomed from the start. There is at least one error or omitted piece of information in each and every lesson which not only adds to the confusion of learning MFC programming but about two hours trying to figure out what is going on. This could have been a really great product if they would have just paid attention to detail and gave a little more of an explanation of what you're actually doing.
5,If you like TV In Flames you should check out Radio Active Cats,"If you Like TV In Flames you should check out Radio Active Acts. It's the Flames first album with a different bass player, on Warner Bros Records instead of Reprise. This guitarist is hands down one of the best around."
3,starts dont reflect album.,"i havent listened to nay of james carters albums, i just wanted to say i saw him live at yoshis jazz club in oakland september 29,2k. he played a 25 minute jam with his band, and i wish more than anything i had recorded it, it was the most amazing show i have ever seen. james and his band were so awesome! that song just blew me away, and hearing him play sax , wow...."
3,Disappointing recording by a brilliant artist,"Let's settle things right from the start. James Carter is a brilliant musician. This recording holds promise but falls short. Carter's ensemble may look like the groundbreaking Prime Time band of Ornette Colemen, but he is unwilling--in the end--to follow through with the funkified harmolodics championed by Coleman. Mind you, there are extrordinary solos by Carter on this recording, and his facility with his instruments is evident throughout. But unlike Coleman's recordings which they resemble, Carter's electrofunk is pretty conventional and doesn't hold up on repeated listenings. Chasing the Gypsy, Jurassic Classics and other Carter recordings are more interesting."
5,Biesemeyer is Best,"Always wanted one of these fences, finally retrofitted my Craftsman with a great fence. The hour you spend installing it,and the savings from not making bad cuts will pay for this fence in no time. Everyone who tries the Bies, buys the Bies. If you are hesitating, it's because you haven't tried one yet. I wanted to wait for my ""new"" saw and include a Bies in the purchase. I never got my new saw, and I'm sorry I waited to upgrade the old Craftsman so long. Best tool in my shop. Bill Biesemeyer new his stuff, and in 20+ years, no one has beat his design (though several have tried to copy it). 20 yrs ago I lived next to the Bies factory in AZ...should have bought one from Bill back then. I'd have 20 yrs of great projects by now. Don't wait ! ! !"
5,Superior Service,The item arrived in perfect condition and right when I was told it would be here. I am very happy with this product and seller. Would have no problem doing busy with them again
4,This car have the wrong wheels!,Maybe I am a perfectionist but: Hudson Hornet does have race wheels (like McQueen). I check this toy at a store and it has the same wheels as the Doc Hudson's version.
5,A Fond Farewell,"Beguiling, beautiful, understated and literate. A fitting finale for one of my very favourite bands. Some of the best guitar sounds I've ever heard committed to tape. They will be missed. Thank goodness I finally got to see them live in Sydney a few years ago."
2,"Sort of effective, but it doesn't give the results you wanted",I took this product for a class last year and its pretty disappointing. There is a bit of stimulants in my thinking but not enough to pass the class. It doesn't give the full results that I wanted. So my advice is to skip it.
4,Rock and Roll in Velvet,"There's nothing wrong with this live reunion of the Velvet Underground. They deliver some fine renditions of tunes they haven't played together in over twenty years. If you're complaining about Lou's involvement, he hasn't showed much enthusiasm for anything other than weight lifting for years. But that's Lou and you can't discount his committed input, because he's there and he is engaged, listen to his rhythm playing and his voice sounds fine. Sterling rips some fine leads, he's not sleeping either, this album rocks, it's the Velvets for god sakes, enjoy it. I am."
3,"Enticing idea, miserably executed","Honestly this would have been absolutely perfect if Reed tried to sing in his old style instead of his post 1980 deep voiced croak....I know he can do it, it just seems that he's trying his hardest to sound unique and outshine the rest of the band (which he fails at)Plus a lot of the song choices are unfortunate as Loaded is overly emphasised....Cale, Morrison and Tucker all sound excellent though and Reed is able to give a manageable performance though very disapointing..."
3,Nico and Andy are missed...,"I'm glad Reed and Cale and the rest put aside their differences and made this album.Maybe I am biased towards their original works but to me the band sounds like any ordinary rock band on a good night.And the Velvets in any year is something that should be OUT of the ordinary.Maybe they were just going through the motions. It's still better recorded than the Max's Kansas City album. Great songs,great sound,the performance isn't totally lacking any heart or emotion.This album is easier for me to recommend than any ""best of"" package for anyone curious about the band because the four original albums were all different from each other,and the live album will prepare you for a journey into their world."
3,Velvet Underground - 'Live MCMXCIII' (Warner Brothers) 3 1/2 stars,"'Live MCM...' was recorded on the band's apparently unlikely reunion in 1993.If you're hoping for a stunning record here,you'd probably be a bit let down.It's okay,not great but decent.I've never been THAT huge of a VU fan,but I thought I'd give this disc a shot.Good alternative proto punk,as one might label it.Cuts I dug the most were ""All Tomorrow's Parties"",""After Hours"",one of their most memorable,the sedate ""Sweet Jane"",""I'm Waiting For The Man""(I've seen this track covered on Hawkwind and Pink Fairies bootlegs/legit CD's)and ""Heroin"".Line-up:Lou Reed-guitar&vocals,John Cale-keyboards,Sterling Morrison(R.I.P.)-guitar and Maureen Tucker-drums."
3,Hmm...,"This was a nice idea and made some money for Sterling Morrison and Maureen Tucker, and parts of it do indeed sound pretty good.But Lou Reed now sounds like a hideous mutation of the musical genes of Yoko Ono, Katherine Hepburn and James Earl Jones. It's a problem.I would have preferred to hear the songs the original four members cut and the hell with Sweet Jane etc. Lou's not gonna do ""Fear Is A Man's Best Friend,"" is he? Cale had nothing to do with the Doug Yule-era material.For hard-core fans only."
3,Not their best.,"This live album by the VU was a little disappointing. After listening to the studio albums, I thought this would be right up there with them. I was wrong. The performance was not that good. The selection of songs was fine, it was what I would expect from a VU concert. However, I would want a little more inspired performance. Go with the two volumes of Live 1969 first. It is much better."
2,Birthday Gift,"It's hard for me to review this item as I returned it. I have no doubt it's a great toy, but not for a 2 year old who loves slides. It was much smaller than I thought. It may be better suited for a younger child who is just learning to climb and hasn't been exposed to the bigger kid toys. I returned it for that reason."
5,Great Climber!,"I got this for my 2 year old and he loves playing on it as much as my 5 year old. I bought it to use inside (in their playroom), since we live in cold, snowy Maine and it is great. I did put down foam squares in case they fell, but so far, so good...no falls!"
5,Great value for a backyard climber,"We've put rubber matting under and all around the climber, and it seems all the more safe to us. Elena loves climbing up and sliding down it, alone and with her playmates, on days when we can't get over to the park. It seems quite sturdy so far."
2,Mom of crazy two year old boy,"The picture for this product is very deceiving. It is not nearly as ""fun"" looking as it appears and my two year old gets bored with it fast. We had a very hard time fitting the pieces together and my son can't even slide down the slide because the surface is not smooth enough. He just kindda pushes himself down it. Def. not worth the money!! I was very dissapointed because this was my son's birthday present from us."
4,Hide & Slide Climber,"My two little ones like to climb. So, it's perfect for them. Anyone over 3 yrs. old, though, would think it's a little boring."
4,Very good for the price,"Our 2.5 year old loves it.Got for her second birthday and plays on it every day.We bought it dierct from the manufacter for less than we could find it anywhere else even with shipping.Was easy to assemble,solid,and light.She is tall for her age and the slide is long enough that she can actually slide on it an will be able to for several more years.cons: The end of the slide curves up a little and she hits her back on it sometimes.Overall it's a great product that we are very happy with."
4,"Not Too Big, Not Too Small","We wanted to get our 18-month old a slide for Christmas but the stand-alone slides seem a little small. However, we didn't want to invest a small fortune because it's hard to know what will intersted a kid in 2 or 3 years. This was the perfect compromise. The slide has a little zip to it and our son gets to climb to his heart's content. But if after a year he gets tired of it, we won't feel bad for wasting a bunch of money. My husband also likes it because it's small enough to move off the grass in order to mow the lawn."
3,Hide & Slide Climber by Little Tikes,"I like the product for its durability, but thought the kids (age 1 & 2 1/2) would play with it more. I think it is a little overpriced for what you get."
3,"OK, Not Great!!","Pros:1. Nice color2. Good size slide for a toddler, compare with other similar products out there.3. It doesn't take up too much space. We have it in our game room.4. Once you get it together, it seems to be pretty sturdy.5. Little Tikes' customer service is slow but nice.Cons:1. It came with missing and defective parts.2. The edges/corners of many pieces require extensive trimming/sanding. They are not smoothed out or nicely trimmed at the factory, potentially dangerous to toddler's knees, hands, or elbows, as she/he climbing in and out the unit.3. One of the replacement part that we received was 3x worse than the original part we had.Would we buy it again?? Probably Not. If we gonna buy something like this again, we most likely would go with Step2. We purchased several items from Little Tikes, not too impressed with their QC, larger/complicated items seem to be more problematic. Smaller toys, LT is ok."
4,Great climber,"We chose this climber for our one-year old because it is a bit taller than others out there, which allows for more actual CLIMBING. Also, the slide is a big longer/higher so that the kids' feet aren't almost at the bottom of it when they are sitting at the top of the slide. But yet it's not so tall that our daughter can't climb on it.The only drawback I can see so far is that the design would allow for a pretty decent fall from the top platform. So, like any toy, constant supervision is a must."
5,MY GRANDSON LOVES THIS!!!,"This was very easy to put together. It has proven to be very sturdy! My grandson LOVES it! We put it in the basement so he would have something to play on in the winter, so he is on it every day. Great value!!!"
5,Little Tikes Hide & Slide Climber,"For once a toy that works as advertised. Easy to assemble. Very durable. My 2 1/2 year old grand daughter would not get off of it, she loves it. Good inside or out."
4,Hours of fun and doesn't take up much room,"I would recommend this slide if you had a small space because it doesn't take up much room but provides hours of fun. YOu can slide down it, crawl underneath in and out of the tunnels, play peek-a-boo, and climb up the back steps. It is strong and sturdy and no amount of jumping on it (as testing by my energectic daughter) will tip it over. A great slide with the extras the kids will enjoy!"
1,How Many Tips and Tricks? About 1/3 of 269,"I was anticipating the book as having fun ideas to spice up an eleven year marriage. I found it most deceptive when many of the tips were brand names of toys. There are much better books out there, try Lou Paget's and pass on this one. I can only think of about 20 things that were new and or exciting!"
2,Less Toys and More Tips,I was disappointed to find so many of the tips were actually suggestions for using toys and props. 500 Lovemaking Tips & Secrets had more useful tips and didnt seem so raunchy.
5,A Soulcall For All,"WOW~ it was worth the wait! Nnenna's new CD has it all at its beck and Soulcall. The cover artwork is mesmerizing and her voice is so big and beautiful. She sounds better than ever and her band shines throughout (especially on the trio version of ""Amazing Grace""). My favorites are the Ella-esque leadoff track ""Better Than Anything"", the sultry ""Let It Be Me"" (featuring Kirk Whalum on sax) and the uplifting ballad ""One Child At A Time"" with background vocals by Sounds of Blackness. And just when I thought it couldn't get any better, Take 6 join Nnenna on an amazing acappella version of Nat King Cole's ""Straighten Up and Fly Right"". If you enjoy Jazz, Gospel or just a wonderful soulful singer, Soulcall is spellbinding! In fact, I venture to wager that there will be a lot of newborns named Nnenna in the years to come."
2,Faux jazz by a wonderful vocalist and a bunch of folks who should know better,"With the exception of Kirk Whalum , his real name ? most of the folks here remain largely innocent of jazz crimes and overproduction . If you were to hear , say , SHAKING FREE , it would be totally understandable that you did not believe it was the same artist . Beverly Botsford (percussion) and Takana Miyamoto (piano and keyboards) should receive light jail sentences . As pertains to authentic jazz musicians such as Chris Potter , Joe Beck , James Williams , Ray Drummond and Ed Thigpen ? They gotta eat . They and Ms. Freelon are forgiven for going ""World Teacher"" . Plead temporary insanity you bunch . It often works. Painful ."
3,A little disappointed,"The book starts out with some great pictures and discussions on items needed to get started. But then I got the impression the writer was late for their deadline and just wanted to get the book out.Most of these projects are aimed at beginners but you'd need some experience to follow the instructions. I think more step-by-step pictures would help a lot. In most cases, you see a beautiful picture of the finished piece and written instructions on how to get there. If this had been my first foray into the world of wire jewelry art, I'd be lost."
2,Not what I'd hoped for,I really liked the piece on the cover and assumed that all the pieces in the book would follow in the same vein and I was sorely disappointed when the book arrived and the projects are kinda crappy. There are a couple of things worth making but they didn't make the purchase worth the cost of the book. The how to part of the book isn't very good either. Explanations assume that the reader knows how to do things and there are very few pictures showing processes. Luckily I know what I'm doing!
2,Thank god for the library,I really liked the cover project and I was going to buy the book but I am so glad I didn't. I checked it out at the library first and I am so glad I did. There are a couple of projects out of the 50 projects that are okay but the rest are very so-so. I'll do the cover bracelet but that's about it. The directions are definitely lacking. You can't see the project from all angles which makes the written directions even harder to follow. I like to see some pictures of the project in progress as not everyone can understand the directions as written. Oh and don't get me started on the WOTWS stupid abbreviation - there's plenty of space on the page - just write it FFS. Quite disappointing book so I'm glad I only paid the reservation fee at the library.
5,wire art jewelry,This book has been the best one I purchased. Tech was full of detail with bueatful designs. GREAT GREAT BOOK
3,Nice projects but...,If you like books that give you nice step-by-step illustrated instructions that clearly make it easy to follow then this book is not for you. I am an experienced jewelry designer with wirework being my favorite medium. I was terribly disappointed in this book because the instructions are very vague and leave you trying to figure out what you are supposed to do. There is not one real picture to help guide you. There are some drawings but they don't even look like the finished piece.The projects are nice but the instructions should be more detailed. You definately better practice a few times with cheap wire before you attempt it in silver. You're left hanging and forced to visualize what each step is supposed to look like. The layout is nice and the tutorials at the beginning are great. I use a lot of books to inspire me but I also like learning step-by-step so I give this book 3 stars for wishy-washy instructions and 5 stars for great projects.
2,Disappointing,"I put this book on my Christmas wish list, and was very happy to find it under the tree. My excitement soon faded when I saw how lacking in basic instruction it is. The coverage of the basics is okay, and there are some nice looking projects, but, while some of the simpler elements are explained (though not well), the reader is left to figure out other major elements on their own. Drawings are poor and don't relate well to the actual piece -- as if graphic interest was more important than accurately detailing what the element should look like. I found the ""WOTWS (Working Off The Wire Supply)"" abbreviation used on many of the projects to be silly and slightly annoying. In every case, there was plenty of room to spell out those five words, and if I don't pick this book up for a month or two, I've got to go hunting again (page 12) for the meaning of the acronym. I would recommend Sharilyn Miller's ""Bead on a Wire"" over this one."
3,"Fabulous projects, lousy instructions","I agree with the previous reviewer. I am a beginner and I really want to do the projects in this book, but the instructions are crummy; there are some procedures for which you need photos and others need clearer written instructions. Step by step photos would probably earn the book five stars. If you are experienced then you could probably do the projects. You might be able to find better instructions for some of the basic procedures in another book and then, after you've become an intermediate wire worker then you can use this one. It really does have some nice looking projects--way nicer ones than those in Linda Jones' book, I think."
4,Useful book,"I wasn't sure if I should order this based on previous reviews, I did anyway.I am very happy I did because not only are there some good illustrations on basic wire wrap techniques , but there are also some imstructions on basic beading patterns such as peyote stitch.I find that the combination of beaded beads and wire can be quite striking in a design.Many of the designs in the book can also easily be changed or brought up a level with just a few minor changes if needed.Overall this is a very useful addition to my library which I do not regret having purchased."
2,Where are the directions?,"The designs in this book are interesting and varied and many are really beautiful, But the directions are pretty much non-existent. As an fairly experienced jewelry maker I could figure those I made, I would not recommend this for anyone who isn't very good at figuring out how to copy from a picture."
4,Great projects,The book provides great projects and has given me a lot of ideas. The only complaint is that while most of the instructions are easy to follow some of the instructions are not quite thorough enough to really figure out on your own. I had to look some of them up on the internet to watch videos of the techniques. But overall I'm really pleased with this book.
4,A lovely and inspirational book,"In this book you get 35 projects/designs marked with skill levels needed for each project. The projects are mostly made with wire, but pearls are also used, in most of the projects.I would say that this is a book for you who has made jewelry before and are familiar to wirework. If so It is a wonderful book! This book offer lots and lots of inspirasjon and expertise."
4,A Solid Set of Tasty Jazz,"Eddie Daniels is a talented and versatile musician who has recorded both jazz and classical music. Homecoming is a jazz recording featuring Daniels on both tenor sax and clarinet backed by Joe Locke on vibes, Tom Ranier on piano, Dave Finck on bass, and Joe La Barbera on drums. With a 2-CD program that includes both standards and originals, ballads and up-tempo romps, Daniels and his bandmates provide as solid set of tasty jazz that should appeal to a broad spectrum of jazz fans.Especially enjoyable is the interplay between Daniels on clarinet and Locke on vibes on several of the cuts, such as ""Under the Wire,"" where they really get into trading off with each other. Another highlight is the band's take on John Lewis's classic ""Django,"" which provides more than 14 minutes of musical pleasure. With good sound and informative liner notes to boot, this is a first-class production all the way, well worth seeking out."
2,Music mobile,It is not at all what I expected. It's pretty and sounds beautiful but you have to constantly be winding up to play and spin every couple of seconds for the baby to enjoy it. That's frustrating. If it was battery operated or at least played for a good 5 minutes without having to wind it up it would have been perfect
3,Looks nice but poor quality,"I received this as a gift to match the other CoCala items in my nursery. It was easy to put together and looks great on the crib. Due to the wide frame on my crib I was unable to hang the mobile where I wanted it(you may want to keep this in mind). If you purchase this item I suggest saving the box. The mobile broke the second time I used it and I had to exchange it. I cannot tell you the exteneded quality as my baby is still not using her crib and I very seldom use it. I can tell you that I believe the mobile is over priced and if given the choice, I wouldn't repurchase."
1,worthless,I bought this mobile to match the crib set. All the cocalo items are pricey junk. The turning/musical part broke after 2 months use. Don't waste your money on this garbage!
4,Adorable,"Super cute and way cheaper than I could find it anywhere else. Delivery way beyond quick. The only thing that I would change is I would like to see Cocalo package their mobile a little better. The mobile box was secure in the shipping box, but the mobile was just clanging around in the box from the manufacturer. Nothing was broken or damaged, but easily could have been. Still a great deal on an adorable mobile that now completes baby's ""Sugar Plum"" room."
3,Wish the music lasted longer,"This is very pretty and goes very well with the Sugar Plum set. My daughter actually really loves to watch the butterflies turn round and round and likes the music to it. I wish the music and mobile lasted longer, however. All in all, not a bad product, but I think we might opt for one of those mobiles with a remote to get a little longer play and put this one on the changing table for short term entertainment."
3,careful with dimensions,"I'm not sure of the value of this review, as I understand from the company that they are phasing out their plumbing supply business (at least the faucets I bought). As a result, they were not very helpful. At any rate, here is the review:The faucet's appearance is as indicated by the photos, which is perfect for our space. The construction seems good, especially for the price.The faucet is NOT manufactured for installation through a 1"" countertop and undermount sink. It is apparently intended for a thinner dimension counter with perhaps a stainless sink...not porcelain or composite. The retaining bolt holding the faucet in place will not engage the threads on the main tube if the counter/sink dimension is too large. We are happy because we had a resourceful plumber, who made it work.5 star for price / quality, but 2 points off for not fitting a standard dimension."
1,Disappointed!!,When I received the glasses- one was broken. They were sent in a padded envelope only. Not stamped fragile. The one that was not broken had a nice picture on it. Would have liked to have the set---was the last one--could not get another.
5,greatest rice cooker,We have had no trouble making any type of perfect rice. This is the best rice cooker we have ever had.
3,inner pot,This is an OK rice cooker but for almost $300.00 I expect the inner pot to keep the coating on for more than a year.After 6 months of use the coating on the inner pot scratched off even when I was very careful to only use plasticrice scoopers/servers when scooping it out of the pot. Now I am having to invest another $70.00 just to replaceinner pot. Zojirushi is definitely not what it once was.
5,Best kitchen appliance ever!!!!!,"I resisted buying a rice cooker because I didn't want another kitchen appliance taking up space on the counter top or in the cupboard. This cooker was suggested by a friend who swore by it...When I saw the price I almost fell over, but eventually talked myself into it. I'm addicted to it. The GABA brown rice is awesome. Trust the Japanese to design such a fabulous cooker. It looks great and does the job. By the way, I usually cook rice for one and chose the mid sized as I heard the small does not do as good a job as the larger ones. Even though the price was high it was worth it."
3,Great rice cooker its last about 1.1 years,The rice cooker is best in class ie five stars.The only negative thing about this rice cooker is that it last about 1 year before it fails. I have just recently had my second rice cooker fail and this time it lasted about 1.1 years similar to the first rice cooker. After contacting Zojirushi they gave me a repair place for the rice cooker. I have already purchased my 3rd zojirushi rice cooker and the repair for the second one will cost $136 dollars.The nice thing is that you can get it repaired and the customer service was really nice on the phone.Both failures caused the digital display to lock up.
2,Stopped working after 2 years,"I loved this rice cooker, and thought it was a great investment: we've tried different kinds of rice and cooking brown rice was not an issue anymore; the performance had always been consistent. I even made quinoa in it and it came out well. We were happy to eat so healthily and recommended this rice cooker to all our friends. However, after 2 years it stopped working - just doesn't turn on anymore. We read that induction function is very capricious and many people had the same experience with this rice cooker. I'm going to buy a cheaper one - I feel that Zojirushi is way overpriced for the length of time it actually works."
5,Best rice I have ever made!,"The Zojirushi rice cooker makes the tastiest rice ever, and it is so easy to use! I bought this particular model because it has the GABA Brown setting and the 5 1/2 cup capacity is small enough that I can make a day's worth of rice just for myself, but large enough that I can make a little bit more when I have company. All I have to do is measure, dump, and turn it on and a few hours later I have perfect rice every time!I have made white and brown rice, quinoa, and oatmeal in the cooker, and all have come out better than I have ever had making it on the stove. I also like the warming function because I can make oatmeal the night before and it will be ready in the morning, or I can set it up to make rice in the morning and it will be perfect for dinner."
2,NOT WORTHY,"IT'S FANCY LOOKING BUT DISAPPOINTING. I HAD A REAL OLD WHITE COLOR SIMPLE COOKER (NATIONAL BRAND), IT COOKED SO MUCH FASTER. RICE CAME OUT BETTER TOO. IT'S BECAUSE RICE STARTS GETTING A LITTLE WET OR BROWNING AT THE BOTTOM SOME TIME AFTER IT'S DONE COOKING THAT I BOUGHT THIS NEW ONE. SO FAR I HAD TRIED COOKING WHITE RICE AS REGULAR,SOFTER AND QUICK COOK, DID NOT MEASURE UP TO WHAT IT SAID. NOT WORTH THE PRICE. NEXT TIME I AM GOING BACK TO NATIONAL BRAND IF IT STILL EXISTS"
3,"Nice Cooker, Poor Documentation","The cooker appears to be of good quality. We managed to make nice white rice, but are still learning how to do long grain brown rice. Despite charts and numbered procedures, the instruction booklet is quite confusing, so you're on your own to figure out how to make different kinds of rice."
1,Zojirushi NP-HBC10,"I am Asian. It can cook very good rice. But it stop working now, only last two year and 6 month. For about $250. It is not worth it."
1,Rice cooker broken in 16 months,"I bought this rice cooker last May from Amazon. Nothing I like it. It cooks very slow. It claims that it can cook brown rice, but that will take at least 2 hours. The final cooked brown rice is too hard to eat. There is no water dripping collecting tub, so the boiling water is spilled all over the counter. Even worse is that it suddenly dones not work after 16 month. When I contacted the company, I was told that the product was in warranty for just one year and it is completely normal for not working after the period. They also refuse to offer suggestions what maybe wrong. Don't buy this product. It's expensive and does not worth it. You will definitely regret."
1,The Lid Gets Stuck,I have purchased the rice cooker only 5 weeks ago and I already am experiencing problems with the lid getting stuck. I am trying to return the unit but I fear that I am already beyond the point when I can return for a full refund.
5,No More Burned Rice!,"Are you tired of rice that is sometimes great and sometimes only so-so? Do you put your rice on high and forget to turn it down until you smell it burning? Well, this rice cooker will solve those problems forever! It's so easy, and the rice, whether brown or white, is perfect every time. All you need is a few stir-fry recipes and you can enjoy quick, easy, and nutritious meals. It's so easy to clean - no more scrubbing those scorched pans or stove tops! I can't say enough about this product."
5,Makes The Best Brown Rice,"Once you get the amount of water right, this cooker delivers perfect GABA Brown rice every time. Same with steel cut oat meal."
1,One of the worst dog foods,"This food is compete garbage. Its main ingrediant is corn, which is very unhealthy for dogs since they cannot digest it. It is just filler that stresses out your dog's digestive systems. You are paying for food your dog can't even digest! Also the meat in this food from meat that was of a too poor quality for human consumption. This includes feet and intestines.Please save yourself time, money, and your dog's health by reading the review of it at [...]"
3,cost way tooooooo much,"I bought it because I thought it would fix my safety concerns when it comes to kick back. I installed it and it was pretty simple, the problem is it has a bit of slop when it is installed and sometimes catches on the wood being cut, really throws you off when you have to stop or it bumps the wood away from the fence OUCH! the springs are way toooooo loose that they rarely keep things from moving back at you, the teeth are not sharp enough. I say this product should retail at about 50% to 75% cheaper, clearly taking advantage of people safety concerns."
2,Too much rework,Being as the product is made by Biesemeyer who is subsidiary of Delta you would think that they could manufacture the product to fit their saws. I had to remove over an 1/8 inch of material from the spreader to allow the standard Delta insert to fit in the tabletop. For that price wouldn't you think that they could get it right.
5,"Look out, Mom! Pee Wee's on the loose!","We bought the entire Pee Wee collections (all 32 episodes) so that my 3 year old could enjoy Pee Wee w/o commercial interruption. Yeah, right. Guilty pleasure and all, I bought them for me. A Pee Wee fan at 40? A Pee Wee fan forever!Pee Wee's Playhouse is a healthy antidote for kids immersed in Pokemon and other touchy-feely, Japanese wide-eyed animated swill. If you can't get the Road Runner or Pepe Le Pew, then Pee Wee can put a smile on your face without explosions, bad guys or pandering to political correctness.Long live Pee Wee Herman."
5,Pee Wee's Playhouse is a winner,"This is a must own for all Pee Wee fans! I have had these videos for a few years now and I must admit I do watch them from time to time. Not only are these aimed at teaching kids about fire vol.7,learning about Hawaii vol.6, dental hygiene vol.4 or just plain ol' pee wee fun but the adult hidden humor is hysterical. I love these tapes. Where are vol 9-16 tho? I have 9 and never bought 10-16. Help !"
5,Excellent Resource,"Legal Ease is exactly what the authors claim it to be: a guide to Criminal Law, Evidence, and Procedure. It has taught me so much about the history of our laws and is a must have for anyone needing information pertaining the field. The authors employ great skills in taking difficult subjects and simplifying them so that law is easier to understand. I love this book and although I use it as a reference for making scenes in my stories plausible, I am now considering taking a paralegal class or two. It's that effective."
5,A great product for older laptops,"I bought this for a Dell Inspiron laptop which had non-operational USB ports, and this card worked flawlessly at high speed (USB 2.0). Much easier than a new motherboard (hundreds of dollars)."
5,Worked just as i needed it to,"This thing was a life saver. My USB ports decided to die on my Dell laptop. I used this and was able to regain the use of my laptop. The alternative of spending $600 on a new laptop was not a possibility at the time.It was easy to install which is necessary, i would get one if you need the extra USB slots!"
1,No Dice...failed in a couple of hours!,"It was installed as per instruction and to a T. It worked for an hour or so, then quit completely. Any additional effort failed to get it going. Item was returned for credit.I bought this based on some positive reviews...obviously I was disappointed. Good luck."
4,Trend net 2 port usb,"Works great on windows 7, Lost all my usb ports now i have 2. Fast shipping also .I picked it up this morning and installed it"
1,"Was not recognized in two of my laptops, XP and Windows 7","Amazon was great in returning both, yes I both, slot cards.Neither worked in either of my laptops, the card was not recognized. The manufacturer's 800 number customer support (India) recommended that I goto a computer store to see if the 2nd unit worked. I did not choose this course, I want it to work in my laptop, not someone else's.So, I returned the 2nd one and will look for another."
1,TRENDnet 2-Port USB PC Card,"Installation was easy however, I have not been able to get any USB devices to function when plugged into it. I haven't had the chance to call technical support yet so I cannot rate at this time. I am using it on a Dell Inspiron 8200 laptop."
3,Call Decoy,Decoy came with broken connector. Had to be repaired before it ever worked. Am using it now but the volume seems low.
3,Safety Concern,"I bought my fence a couple of years ago before Delta took over the company. The rear rail arrangement does not allow for the blade guard to be placed on my 1976 model Craftsman saw. I recently contaced the Service center and asked for assistance in rectifying this apparent manufaturing oversight. I was told just to cut a slot in the rear-rail. I then asked for a print or directions indicating exactly where cut so as not to weaken the rail. Delta has conveniently elected to ignor my request. I assume the persons reviewing the request haven't heard of product liability. Other than that, and having to drill many mounting holes the fence works well."
1,disappointed,"Great concept, weak battery. The cigarette adapter never worked, the battery degraded after 1 season (3 camping trips) unable to find replacement battery. It's going in the trash"
1,Dynamo Lantern,"I purchased two lanterns and both were defective. On the one lantern, only the LED lights worked. The bulb would light and then go off immediately. The other lantern would not work at all. I strongly recommend you do not buy this product. Both items were returned for full refund."
1,ACE Hardware & Vector review,"For an official review, go to:Ace Hardware site & Epinions to view this item & read the very poor reviewCheck with the BBB to find advertising issues with ACEThis unit does not come with half the items listed in the ad and reportedly doesn't work well"
5,BUY THIS BOOK,"I am a garage sale-er, crafty, painter, do-it-yourselfer. But this book really opened my eyes. I now look at things quite differently. This book by-passes Shabby Chic and makes any style (your personal style) attainable without having to get a second job."
1,You've got to be kidding!,"This will be the first book I have ever returned to Amazon. If you enjoy a litany of what this author bought at garage sales and how much she paid, then read on. I found about 8 color pages and the rest was drawings. Out of date look to it. Who wants 15 refrigerators and 55 TV sets anyway?"
5,A Must read!,"This is what the paris apartment should of been! This just shows the old saying is true-- you can't judge a book by its cover! I almost didn't pick this book up because of the cover, But I'm thankful I did! Easy to read and filled with great Ideas, even if you aren't into secondhand things. Even with lack of glossy photos, is a goldmine of info!"
2,outdated feel,"Sorry, I didn't like this book at all. ""Crafty"" how-to's, an outdated feel, poor photos.It was not worth what I spent on it."
1,I am so dissapointed,I am so dissapointed in this book as it is nothing like I had expected. I will be returning it.
2,Disappointing,Janette Hospital is my favorite author. Her best books are 'Borderline' and 'Charades'. 'Oyster' is too hard to read. 'Due Preparations...' just does not astound like her early books do. Seems knocked off just to satisfy a book contract or something and is not from the heart. Still my favorite author though.
1,complete crap,The ending should have been at least two chapters longer. Dissapointing to the last word. Do not waste your time or money. Read Brian Keene instead.
5,future,"i knew him personally many years ago..he was a briliant author, and a most interesting man...he dealt with the possibility of imortality and the prospect in the future. his books are ingenuous in that he delves in the unknown,. for the inquisitive reader in sociological phenomena i highly recommend it....sidney maurer...if anyone knows where he is ...i would appreciate it if you can get in touch with me rdm719@aol.com"
3,Wha'd 'e say?,"This review will be brief. I can understand some cosmology and James Joyces' Ulysses, play a pretty good game of chess, write legal briefs that work. But I cannot understand Mr. Mack's writing. It's like Finnegans Wake.I'm sure he is a very intelligent man. He has a wonderful vocabulary. But it is not all immediately recognizable as standard English. His premises are very thought provoking, but his proofs are unintelligable.Perhaps it's Social History. I didn't do well in my Social History class at Berkeley. They seem to make things up as they go along, as though by gnosis. Mr. Mack needs to limit his exposition to the immediate point. Alternatively, he may simply be intellectually beyond me."
3,Review of Mark Knopfler's 'Screenplaying',"This has some great stuff, but just about all of it is in the beginning of the disc from the movie 'CAL'. There are some other good tunes, but too few and too far apart on the disc. All of it is nice to listen to, I was hoping for more upbeat material or in lieu of that, more tunes like those from 'Cal'. That stuff is great."
5,Almost as good as it gets,MK's distinctive style and genuine mastery of his craft and instrument place him at a pinnacle with only a few peers. Truly one of the truly greatest musicians of the modern era.
5,Awesome,While I have all of these songs from their respective CD's the compilation is terrific. I would recommend it for any Knopfler fan.
3,"Buy it for ""Victims""","Yes, this is just stuff MK wrote for films and most of it is rather boring for the most part, but if you want to hear a beautiful song, listen to ""Victims"", which in my opinion (and I own ever Dire Straits and Mark Knopler album) is the best song he has ever written. There are no words or singing - and no guitar - just violins and a cello. Let me tell you folks, it may be the most beautiful song that's ever been written.The rest of the album is great for reading or something - there's really not a lot on here that's really noticable (I am surprised they left off ""The Rocks and the Water"" from Cal, which was a very decent song). Anyway, just my 2 cents."
2,It's a snoozer.,"I like a few tracks on this CD (like Local Hero and Princess Bride) just because I liked the movies. In general, this CD has very little to recommend it."
2,Boring with a splatter of humor,"I was hoping to read some really cool stories about people's experiences out on the trail. While to an extent that happens, the stories are very boring and seemingly written by a non-writer. There are some really dumb stories as well. For example, there is one that deals with a black hole that a rider rides through and defeats some type of dragon (yes, I said dragon). There is another story about some guy who finds himself stranded on the trail and eventually finds himself making love to an environmentalist woman. Maybe you would enjoy this book more than I. I simply did not get it."
4,History Rewritten?,"For many years it was assumed the Red Baron was taken down by RAF pilot Roy Brown. In recent years, however, that theory has been challenged, and it now seems that it most likely was not Roy Brown. So who was it?The program reveals that von Richthofen was killed by a single bullet entering his right side and exiting on the left; such a trajectory could not have come from above, where pilot Roy Brown was when he briefly pursued the Baron. Instead, a conclusion is drawn that is similar to one in an episode of PBS's Nova (""Who Killed the Red Baron?""): namely, that it was not Roy Brown, but a member of an Australian infantry unit that fired the fatal shot. Interestingly, although both programs agree that the bullet did not come from Brown, they differ on which Australian on the ground that day was actually responsible. So who was it? Watch both programs and decide for yourself!Four stars. This video helps dispel a long-held belief, but opens a new mystery in the process!"
3,Horribly dated,"Unless you are an extremely big fan of Bob & Tom, I can not recommend getting this CD excrpt at bargain-basement prices. Any of the bits that was any good are already on the Greatest Hits CD. When one of the best bits on the CD is Bob Zany, you know you are in for a rough ride."
5,Philmore Battery Holder,"I have a review on the Battery Clip that I used along with this holder and new rechargeable batteries to make a replacement pack for a radio/mp3 player. I said it all on that review, and it was all good. I'll see if I can link this to the other review.9V Battery ClipSanyo NEW 1500 eneloop 8 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable BatteriesYes, these are the links to the other products I used. Just be sure the battery pack dimensions will fit for your use, duh..."
5,Helmet meets Tool meets Nirvana!,Amazing that three brothers can get along long enough to put out such great music. :o) This chicago trio can rock!
3,decently derivative,"This cd is okay, but not particularly moving. The sound is squashed and flat. The vocals are buried by the wall of guitars. At times there's no cohesion between the sound of the drums and the other instruments. It's almost like the producer was playing his own special gag on the band... I had to laugh at the end of one of the songs when the vocals get panned completely to one side.I'll be putting this one in my ""to sell"" pile. Oh well...."
5,You WONT be dissappointed with album guaranteed!!!,"OK, SO I BOUGHT CHEVELLE'S WONDER WHATS NEXT ALBUM AND THERES ALSO NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW MUCH I LOVE THE ALBUM SO I THOUGHT THAT, HEY I'M GONNA CHECK OUT THEIR FIRST ALBUM I POPPED IT IN AND WAS STUNNED AT HOW MUCH RAWER IT SOUNDED WITH STEVE ALBINI'S WORK ON IT (NIRVANA) IT SOUNDS SO GREAT EVERY SONG HAS SO MUCH PASSION POURED IN FROM THE WORKS OF ALL THE LOEFFLER BROTHERS THIS ALBUM IS EXTREMELY GOOD YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS ALBUM GIVE IT A SHOT, BUY IT AND HEY IF YOU DONT WANT TO IT'S YOUR LOSS!"
4,"They are NOT a christian band, people!","First and foremost - Chevelle are not a christian band. Yes, this was released on a christian label, but they have publicly stated that they are not christian, do not mix religion and music, and are not religious... So don't let that mistake deter you from a great cd.Now that that's out of the way, this is a great cd. It's more rock-esque and there is a raw and quality about the tracks which may have helped their later cds."
5,Passion that is rarely beat in other albums!,"Chevelle now out with their newest album Wonder what's next has become really popular. But before Wonder what's next there was point #1. This album is pure passion. Pete Loeffler puts all of himself into this album and it shows. I can't stop listening to it because of the passion. The lyrics are vague and the music is simple but those weaknesses aren't weaknesses because of the unsurpassing passion. The production on this album is really raw and not polished. Wonder what's next has a pop/metal feel to it because of the polished production, but point#1 is very raw and not polished. Each song on this album deserves to be listened to. Drop Wonder what's next and pick up a copy of point #1 you won't be disappointed I assure you. God bless!"
4,"Cuz he'll say, pay for it, the whole sum....","well, i must say that i did buy this before Wonder What's next came out. However, I did not like this one very much. Its very dark, and while i do like the first track, (which blows away most of the material on Wonder What's Next) the rest of it is kind of bland.Point #1 is the best song on here. what i will also say is that the lyrics are darker. they seem much more focused on being sad then what Wonder What's Next is about. So thats a major disappointment because all of the sad stuff has been done before.Thats why i prefer Wonder What's Next....but this is still a good listen if you need to breka away from the Wonder What's Next material and away from the Tool style but still have a little bit.later"
4,Not bad at all...,"I sought out this CD because ""Point #1"" was stuck in my head. I wasn't ready to buy it, really, but when I saw that it was recorded by Steve Albini, that was all the convincing I needed. If you're a fan of his production work, this is another one of his case studies -- up-front drumming, super-crunchy guitars and the menacing bass. If you love Steve Albini, I think you need this. And with songs like ""Mia,"" ""Long"" and ""sma"", you'll want to do more than study Albini's work. This CD rocks like nothing else I've heard in a long while. I don't hear much of a Tool influence -- I think the influence is more Chicago alt- and post-rock flavored. So if you're into that stuff, this'll probably please you."
2,Not as good as the newer ones...,"I'm a big fan of Chevelle and after it getting this album I realize it definetly doesn't match up to their newer albums but its not bad either. It actually sounds like a totally different band. Most of the songs on this album you have to listen to several times to get used to them. But if your looking for a good Chevelle album ""This Type of Thinking (Could Do Us In)"" is their best in my opinion. Anyway, here are my ratings for the songs...1./2. Open/Point #1 4/53. Prove to You 4/54. Mia 2/55. Skeptic 2/56. Anticipation 2/57. Dos 3/58. Long 1/59. Blank Earth 2/510. Sma 5/511. Peer 2/5"
1,Sounds like Tool on their worst day!,"It's obvious these guys aren't creative. They're trying too hard to sound like Tool. Maybe the vocalist can come close, but the writing talent is a different story."
5,fantastic,"Chevelle are one of those bands that people have heard a couple of their songs on the radio only and say ""oh yeah, i know Chevelle, etc, etc"". They are one of those bands you DO NOT know...unless you buy and listen to their cd's. Much heavier and more Tool-like than their few songs that have ended up being played on the radio, they are a great band and a great live act.I actually bought this CD at a show way back in either 2000 or 2001, can't remember for sure, a year or two before most people even heard of them.... They opened for Static-X and i couldn't believe how good they were so i bought the CD at the booth.The CD is somewhat dark and fairly heavy. It's worth the price of the CD just for the opener ""Open/Point #1"". I have hundreds of CD's from all kinds of rock/metal bands and that could easily be my favorite song. Highly recommended."
2,"Arrg.. starts off good, gets annoying later!","I liked this band when I first heard them! TOOL is probly my favorite band. But when I heard the album, it annoyed me that these kids are trying to be the christian TooL! Mia and a few others are good songs, I'll grant you that, but the rest of the album is some what predicibale, and boring!"
5,Chevelle's music is the new GRUNGE of the midwest,"Hailing from Chicago, Illinois, Chevelle has shown that grunge has not disappeared from the face of the earth. Singer/Guitarist Pete Loeffler has shown his immense songwriting talent through his Cobain-esque dynamic shifts: his often solemn song intros preclude explosive choruses. Though the album does have a hint of repetitiveness to it (the first two tracks share the same opening riff, albeit one being distorted), there is no shortage of entertainment. For those that seek a derivative of grunge bands such as Nirvana and Tool, with a bit more low end, Chevelle is the right band. Album highlights:""Sma"":as diverse, intense, and emotional as a two minute-twenty eight second song can get.""Anticipation"": Loeffler utilizes his wah pedal just to shape his tone, instead of rocking it back and forth to get the ""wah-wah"" effect.""Peer"": Builds from calm to a fury, illustrating the dynamic shifts, and is a fitting way to end the album."
5,pleasantly suprised,"Because of all the reviews I heard about this album, I was expecting a second-rate, religious TOOL. I will admit that when I first listened to Point #1 it sounded alot like TOOL during their Aenema period, however the more I listened to it the more Chevelle sounded wholly different and incredibly beautiful. Point # 1 is an incredibly impressive record, with talented instumentals and breathtaking vocals. I am really looking foward to their follow up ""Wonder What's Next"" which will be out in August"
5,Its Worth the money trust me,"The haunting vocals, the simple yet very effective guitar parts, the super low rumbling bass, and the solid drumming make this album great. I love how they build up from no distortion to full power. i heard it was recorded on all analog stuff. It gives it this raw feel that many shallow albums today dont even come close to today. i cant wait for the next cd keep up the good work...."
4,Great rock cd,"Great, but not the best. My favorite tracks include Point #1, Mia, Long, Blank Earth, and Peer. It is worth the listen - they're expected to have a new album coming out later this year. Hopefully that will be even better than this one. Chevelle looks like it will have a promising future."
2,homoerotic? Hardly,"I'm weary of films claiming to be erotic, homoerotic, or anything to do with men in love, that just aren't. This is about men killing each other. The only love scene is straight.Another waste of money unless you want to see a movie about war, anger, revenge and rape. Nudity? what nudity? What versions are these other reviewers seeing?"
4,Unexpected,I wasn't sure this was going to be a good film but it actually is. I loved the end result. Just seems fitting.
3,a bit short,"Be careful, this is not for the 1998 season. It is for the 1997 season, which ended in 1998. Although a bit short, the commentary is good."
2,It's wall paper....need to soak in water!,"This is obsolete! I can't believe they won't do this with self adhesive, removable glue...."
3,So-so,"I measured out the room and figured I needed 2 rolls. Turns out I need 3.. The rolls are shorter than what they are listed as, but the pre-paste absolutely sucks. It sticks wonderfully in the middle of the paper, but the edges do not stick for anything. I followed the directions to a T, and wound up buying some wall paper adhesive to make it stick. We went with the sugar plum theme, with the top half of the room pink and the bottom half plum, so this was the obvious choice to seperate the colors. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone going with the sugar plum theme, but I would recommend just getting the wall paper adhesive and using it to begin with. That stuff is like $5 for a small tub of it(and unless you are doing your entire house with the border, this is all you will need)."
1,Mat,"I have been waiting for this Mat for almost a month from this company, I have yet to receive my item, after many emails to Montana Gift, I have not gotten my purchase, they did not even explain to me what went wrong with there delivery, I think they forgot. If I do receive my Mat from them, it will be the last item I will order from them. I have never waited for a purchase so long."
4,"""It's a Rev Co world...""","As a huge fan of Al Jourgensen, I am familiar with all Ministry and RevCo music. I've had this disc since it first came out back in 1993. I'd say 'Linger Ficken' Good...' is probably RevCo's second best overall album, after 1990's classic ""Beers, Steers & Qveers"".Songs of note: the 9 minute ""Creep"" is a heavy tune, with a strong beat. ""Mr Lucky"" is a guitar driven song with a hilarious opening dialog. My favorite is ""Butcher Flower's Woman"", probably the hardest song on the album. The cover of ""Do Ya Think I'm Sexy"" is the most popular song on here, but in my opinion the song is merely average. The title track is an interesting song with funny spoken word dialog & sampling throughout, all on top of a sorta sped-up big-band bass line and drum beat.The other songs don't do much for me.If you are a fan of Al's work in Ministry, and you are looking to explore the music of RevCo, then ""Linger Ficken Good"" is a good example of RevCo's earlier music."
2,please don't give up on them,"I hate to give anything a bad review, but for this CD I will. RevCo is one of my favorite bands, because I am a diehard Ministry fan. You must understand however, that this is not Ministry, and if that is what you are expecting, you would be well advised to look at something else. Actually, if you are looking for real RevCo, try another one of their CD's like ""Beers, Steers, and Queers"" or ""Stainless Steel Providers"". Besides a couple of tasty tunes and pretty hard laughs, this CD just left me flat."
1,Crap,"This album sounds like video game music composed by a crack addict...but, I guess if you like that kind of stuff, this is for you."
4,"If its barbershop you want, get the original","This CD is incredible, and although the standbys are flawless (namely 76 Trombones and Rock Island), if you bought the CD to hear the new quartet as I did, you may be in for a disappointment. The Buffalo Bills (the quartet from both the original Broadway and motion picture version) are hard shoes to fill, and the new singers just don't have that full rolling sound. Their sound is much more tinny and staccatic. However, I was very excited to see the entire scene in which they are taught to sing (Ice Creeeem) was included. Overall, the CD is incredible, but if its barbershop you want, buy the original."
4,"For a revival, not bad at all","Craig Bierko sounds remarkably like Robert Preston, if his singing wasn't so natural you would think he was a mimic. That is both the strength and weakness of this revival, which succeeds not so much because it has any new perspective or orchestrations or insight to offer (such as the great Guys and Dolls revival) but because it is so faithful to and sounds so much like the original. One wonders in passing, then, what the point is; but then again, there are numbers that weren't included in any of the previous recordings so that probably alone justifies owning this as well as either the Broadway version (still the best in my opinion) or the film version. The one number which falls well short of the original is Rock Island, it is, to put it mildly, painful, but once you get past that it is all very good because the original was so good."
5,Good album,This is a really good albumi liked all the songs and her vocals sound really well donethe presentation of the cd is awsumif u like The veronicas you will love this
1,BEWARE defective product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this is the third battery of this kind i have bought in the last 6 months , the first one worked fine no problems the last 2 have not worked, from the unpackaging they have not accepted charge and the last one was big enough that it almost didn't fit my pda, let alone the pain it was trying to get it outi was willing to accept 1 battery failure right out of the packaging but 2 consecutives no sir."
4,"Great Burner, Crappy Software","This burner is very easy to use, just plug it in and go. I had to get a USB card because I didn't have USB 2.0. The burner will work without, but it will take two hours to burn a dvd. After the USB upgrade it took only minutes to burn a dvd. The only thing I would recommend is to not use the burning software that is included (Nero). It lagged my computer and would abort the burning process at times. I tried the online free 21 day trial of CloneDVD 2 and then decided to purchase it because it works so well. Overall this is an excellent burner, good price, and the lightscribe feature is nice."
5,DVD Burner Great Review!,"I am very happy with the HP DVD Writer. It is easily installed onto your computer and has made my boyfriend incredibly happy (one of his XMas Gifts). Easy to use, Does not take up a lot of space, Works Great!"
2,Inconsistent performance,"I've been using this dvd writer for about two months now. Sometimes it works fine. Sometimes it doesn't. It plays movies without a hitch, but I end up throwing out about half the dvds I try to burn either because it aborts in the middle of the burning process or because the final dvd won't play (either on my computer of my dvd player). I bought it to replace an internal dvd writer, which worked with my existing software for years, so I know the problem is not with the software or my system. I'm not happy and would not buy this product again, knowing what I now know about it."
3,Light-Scribe is not all you expect.,"The HP 20x is a low price external drive that works great as a CD/DVD burner. The Light-Scribe on the other hand was a let down. To get the Light-Scribe to work I had to download an updated driver from Light-Scribe's website. I had to set the program to burn at Top Quality and the darkest setting but, still you can barely see the images. I can burn 3 CD's in the time it takes to make one Light-Scribe label.It is still a cheap answer to CD labels just not a quality answer."
1,Horrible product! What would I expect from HP?,"HP must stand for something? Hmmmmm let me think about that for a minute. 'help please', 'hatefully pathetic'...I could think of more. But I have already wasted way too many hours on this 'horrible product'."
1,WAS NOT NEW!,"PRODUCT WAS NOT NEW, PRODUCT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS USEDAND REPACKED ALL BACK TO ORIGINAL PACKAGING.(WHICH LET ME TELL YAH. WHO EVER REPACKED IT DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO PUT THE INSERTS BACK ON UNIT CORRECTLY) I WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THAT UNIT NOT BEING NEW. BESIDES THAT EVERYTHING WAS IN BOX.I AM HOPING IT WILL WORK FOR A LONG TIME SEEING HOW I KNOW IT WAS NOT NEW IN A BOX."
2,Buy the LG Super multi instead,"This was great. Easy to install, easy to use, and just my luck only worked half the time. This would only burn half the lightscribe top layer. The disk would have to be inserted numerous times and sometimes the entire picture would burn. I thought I had purchased faulty disks--not the case! I purchased a faulty burner. HP has the worst customer service (it feels wrong puting the two phrases in the same sentence). Never again!"
3,HP 20x External Super Multi DVD,"I purchased this product because I want to copy the e-cards I made from my PC to DVD. It really copied well, I had a few done and given it to friends but, now it's not copying anymore it ejects the DVD without finalizing it. I don't know what's the problem, I guess I have to return it and get another brand or get a new one. Suggestion: try the product right away so you can see if there are any defects."
3,"works great, doesnt feel durable",The case is plastic but it works great. AVOID NERO!!!!! I got a trojan from their updates! (Spywareguard 2009) Its only a trial anyways and it lasts 30 days. Roxio is a little better but not as easy to use.
5,For all my cheap siblings!,"After years of wasting money buying dvds,I can now make copies for my brothers who don't know how to return movies.My Library is now growing instead of depleting!!Money well spent."
4,"yummy, but arrived melted","tases great, but was melted, so arrived in a large block in each package instead of the easily meltable disks."
1,misleading,"I found this toy very misleading. I thought Ernie was a bath time toy. He isnt. He cannot go in the tub. Also, his robe cannot be removed. It is sewn on."
2,good yet boring,"I was impressed with the quality in which this book came.The subject was interesting; however, it was boring at times."
3,"Fun toy, but breaks easily","I bought this toy for my 3 year old niece. She was thrilled, but the toy stopped working properly the very next day. Now Elmo sings only part of his dance song."
4,Child will love..........,My daughter got this for her 1st b-day and she loved it then and still loves it now at 2 years old. Her father and I on the other hand....... are sick of Elmo. This Elmo is very durable though. He has taken many beatings and has been dropped off the table many times and still works just fine. He's very good on batteries too. I haven't had to change them since we got him.
3,At a loss...Elmo stops short,"Although my 18-month old daughter really enjoys dancing ELMO, it is by no means child friendly. The ""on"" buttons are difficult for a small child to find and he is, due to his mechanics, not a carry-around-cuddle-toy. In addition, within two weeks of receiving the toy, he cut his song in half as though the circuitry shorted out. Regardless of the toy's faults, I hope to exchange it for another since my daughter loves listening to the song and watching him dance."
4,Momo is a hit,"My 18-month old has not been impressed with anything we've purchased her so far, but Elmo was a winner. She sings, dances, claps, laughs and kisses him. I've never seen her interact with any toy like that. He doesn't do much & seems like one good drop will shatter him, but so far he's baby's new best friend."
5,Great Buy!,"I bought this as a birthday present and it was the hit of the party. Since that time I have asked the mother how the little one is enjoying her Elmo. She cannot say enough wonderful things about it. Her daughter has made a new friend in this delightful guy. She sings with him, dances with him and no matter how rough she is, he still bounces back. I think we have a winner here. Well worth your money and the enjoyment of a child."
4,Great Toy!!!,". I gave this to my son for his 2nd birthday and he just adores it. He loves dancing and trying to do all the moves. It seems to be very durable...HE has pulled on the mouth, twisted it's head and thrown it so many times. If it was going to tear up then my son is the ultimate tester!! LOL!!! Each hand when pressed does something different as far as a saying or a cheer goes, not like some other toys which says the same thing over and over. I would recommend this for an ELMO loving toddler. I hope this helps!!Kim/ TN"
3,Yay...ANOTHER Elmo toy...whee...,"FUN- Oh yeah he's real fun. Watch him drive you insane with his high-pitched, annoying, little voice as he dances and sings a horrid version of ""YMCA"". Makes me wonder if the Village People got any royalties for this toy.EDUCATIONAL VALUE- None to speak of unless your kid doesn't know how to spell ELMO, which is highly doubtful since ELMO pretty much took Sesame Street by storm.DURABILITY- He can take a few whacks with a hammer, that's for sure. I actually had to move up to a 5# hammer before he died.OVERALL RATING- One of the most annoying toys on this mudball we call home. Jim Henson is rolling in his grave as we speak."
4,Great fun for my little one,I bought this toy as a Christmas present for my 14-month-old and she loves it. Elmo dances and sings and she tries to follow along. It's a cute toy and is parked in front of the couch in our livingroom for easy access. I only wish it came with a volume control but this isn't one of those annoying toys so it's not unbearable to listen to Elmo sing over and over again.
3,Does ELMO really know how to spell??,The chear part of the ELMO dolls preformance sings E N M O instead of ELMO.Pretty sad expecially when your 20 month old is learning how to say his ABC'S Something should be done about this. The part when the doll makes the letters with his arms is really cute.
3,its ok,"my daughter got this toy for her 2nd b-day and just played with it a few times and now that she's 3 not at all, she just liked to knock him down cuz he would ask for help and then say thank you"
1,"mommy, theres a monster under the bed..............","Hi. my name is Miriam and i am 12 years old. my little four year old sister jackie got this ""toy"" for christmas. well it all started christmas morning when we opened our presents. this was the last present my little sis opened and she was terified of it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So i hid it under my bed for her. Then, my little sister got up a few days later in the middle of the night because she had a bad dream. she was walking over to my bed (we share a room) to wake her up. and then she tripped over E-L-M-O!!! She screamed and screamed and then my mom came into the room and asked her what was wrong. ""Mommy, theres a monster under the bed"". And then mom turned on the lights and saw it was just stupid E-L-MO!!! The whole point of that was to tell you SOME little kids might be afraid of elmo."
3,"OK, but better elseware","I could see that this could be a good book if you were brand new to table tennis and had a coach. Good drills for practicing with similarly leveled players. However, I feel book does not accurately describe how to truely improve your stroke. Descriptions tend to be vague and leave it to the player to experiment to get the result they are looking for. The danger for the player without a coach is that common early bad habits that are effective for begginers will become engrained. Also, the strategy section is not as good as in other TT books."
5,EXCELLENT TABLE TENNIS BOOK,"This book will tell you everything that you ever wanted to know about how to improve your table tennis game. Easy to read, and has many helpful drawings to illustrate the point being made. Covers the basics as well as advanced concepts. Each chapter contains many drills to help the reader master the different types of strokes and strategies."
2,It's good but i still can't play well,This book is very detailed and has many well points the help rise the level of your game. It is good to read but it didn't help me when I actually went to the table.
2,"i agree, you do better for free","for all of the reasons described above, i too, like the streetwise series, but i didn't end up using this map...i'd say it rates fair/fine/ok. i had done some travel planning but upon arrival in prague found that the local/free/tourist maps showed more of central prague, better. just one specific example: the uzjed/petrin funicular was left off (or covered up by a key). and the flipping back and forth was inconvenient - something i'd expect and accept for central to suburb transition but not central to central locations."
5,Great Map,I used this map while I was in Prague and thought it was great. I had no problems and found it helpful. I would recommend it to anyone going to Prague.
5,best maps,Streetwise are great maps. We buy one as soon as we start planning a trip. We can then plan an itinerary that makes geographic sense. We mark the places we plan to go and see what restaurants are nearby. Because they are laminated they don't get beat up an can be written on.
3,Useful but not essential,"The map is convenient to use, and the lamination keeps it from getting destroyed from use. But it is relatively expensive considering you can get the same map in your tourist guide or for free from any one of a number of places once you get to Prague."
5,The most POWERFUL book!!,"I have studied various Kabbalisitc texts, and I have found this book to be the the most practical explanation of the Kabbalah. Put's the Kabbalah into your day-to-day life. Literally, this book has opened up life's truths and has placed them right in front of my face."
1,Waste of time - or even worse,"Forget about it. ""Rabbi"" Berg is no more of a rabbi than I am a rebbetzin (to use an old quote).Do some research on the Web and you'll see some interesting things about him."
1,This book is pure nonsense,"I am not impressed by anything that Berg writes. He is no kabbalist. This book demonstrates a real lack of understaning about some of the most fundamental issues.It is no wonder that (on his website - ...) that he now sells bottles of ""kabbalistic water"" which have been ""blessed"" by Berg.This book is shallow and has nothing to offer."
1,The space of music,"The space of jazz feelings is so huge, but too little without Jay Oliver's ideas and the Buzz's art of making awesome melody.The most of DWB's musical creativity was in the soul of Jay. Who knows what was in the hearts of Buzz, Jay, Brandon, Tom and Dave after Synergy's out. Legends are empty? I HOPE NOT!!!! Check out Full Moon Second and Whirlies."
3,"Different, but not his best work","I agree with some of what I've seen others say. He's clearly a phenom. but it gets a little annoying after a while. No need to rip the chops out CONSTANTLY.This is good to have as part of your collection, and I did like it better than some of his earlier solo work...but this would not be the first (or even 2nd) of Weckl's releases that I would recommend."
1,The WORST customer service ever,"We purchased this item (one similar) to this last Christmas. Shortly after the first use, we were unable to watch the recordings on a tv screen. After being transfered to numerous people at Sakar customer service, we were told the problem was with the AV cable and they would ""happily"" send us a new one.It has now been 7 months, 7 phonecalls, and 7 more promises that they would send a new cable, and they still have not followed through. I have talked to several managers, but when I call back to speak to that particular manager they are somehow never ""available"". I think they have a phantom employee named Andrew and he is the scapegoat for any troubles. When you call to speak to him, he doesn't exist . . . yet he was the manager that made all of the promises.I would NEVER buy anything from this company ever again. The camera itself was okay, but if you encounter any kind of warranty issue, dealing with this company is a nightmare!!!!BUYER BEWARE."
2,ranks of mediocrity,"Sure, this book could inspire great designs, but so could a box of chocolates. It's more of the same. It simply doesn't rise above all the mediocre titles available on the market. Recommended if you're trying to build a sizable graphic design library, but if this is the only layout resource/inspiration book you might buy, think again."
1,"Wow, can we say off key?","Holy cow... I was just looking for new cds and found someone's recommendation for this one. I didn't buy it, but just heard the samples. I actually winced and had to turn it off, she was so flat. Her intonation is absolutely awful! (Meaning, she's really out of tune). I am a singer with a really good ear, and honestly, I can't listen to it... I feel bad saying that, but it's the truth."
1,Looks good ... but works bad,"I've had a couple different chalk lines and this one was by far the most frustrating I've used. The line got stuck so many times I knew how to take it appart real quick. The all plastic mechanisms inside wore down real quick and it didn't hold up very well at all. After doing a single roof with it I threw it out, purchased new string for my old one and still have it.Whether it'll handle a drop from a roof ... I don't know ... was tempted many times to throw it off the roof.Highly recommend not buying this product. There are plenty of good chalk lines on the market. This is living proof that looks aren't everything.Hope this email didn't sound too negative.I hope someone reads this and saves their money."
1,hate it,garbage jambed up first time using it couldnt even real the line in on it messed with it for 20 mins finaly the gears stripped
4,Works,"It's relatively heavy and aesthetically abit crude looking device. Being a universal fit product, you would probably end up doing some modification. The solenoid travel is little less than 1/2 inch but torque is very strong. Electrical hook up is pretty straight forward and product comes with more than enough parts to complete the job in any vehicle. The hardest part about installation in my opinion was finding a suitable mounting location for the unit."
5,One of Deerhoof's best albums,"""Apple O"" is a colorful storm of experimental garage rock. I like it more every time I listen to it. This album contains some of the most fun, crazy, and interesting rock music I've ever heard. Imaginative lyrics from Adam and Eve, to bombs, to panda bears, to eating Portabello with exploding candles. I recommend this album to anyone who likes garage rock, experimental music, and/or is open minded.Deerhoof is, in my opinion,one of the most creative and crazy rock bands ever. If you are just getting into Deerhoof, I recommend you start with ""Apple O"", along with ""The Runners Four"" and ""Deerhoof vs Evil"".Favorite tracks: Dummy Discards a Heart, Flower, Apple Bomb, L'Amour Stories, Panda Panda Panda, Blue CashLeast favorite track: Hayley and Homer (it's still a good song!)"
5,BRILLIANT!!!,"I was at my friend's house one day and he introduced me to deerhoof and i bought a cd of Deerhoof, Apple O a month later. I first popped in the cd in my radio and listened. the First song had so much energy, and got me very excited. These are my highlights of the cd: Dummy Discards a Heart,Heart faliure, Flower, Apple Bomb, Panda panda panda, Blue cash. This album is great. If you are just looking for a different band, that doesn't sound like all the stuff they play on the radio, deerhoof is your band and Apple O is a good introduction to Deerhoof. It is poppish experimental rock, and don't let the vocals in the first few songs throw you off because when you get used to them you see the genius."
4,nintendo Characters in real action!,"This was a pretty good game when I first played it. My dad bought it for me a year ago for getting good grades on my report card.The first I thing I did was the i player mode. It was fun only was kind of too easy.I liked it when I won the secret characters like Ness, Jigglypuff, Captain Falcon, and Luigi.The game is relly fun when I am playing the vs. mode with family memebers and friends.i also liked the board the platforms and break the targets.The game gets kind of boring after you unlock all the secrets but hey there is still lot's to do with this game."
4,Smashing!,"A GREAT game! It's one of my favorite N64 games. I play it all the time, and it's tons of fun when friends are over. N64 is a great system because there are tons of great games for it, and this one just says that all over again. I'll give it infinite stars!"
1,Super Super Super!!!,I love this awesome game except after you get all (4) the secret characters and a new stage there is bsoulutly nothing to do! But when I have friends over it is awesome!
1,I have 3 words for ya: This game stinks,"Out of all the fighting games I played, this was the worst of them all. The controls are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too easy. I like games with at least a little bit of blood and dying. I got tired of this after a few weeks. I usually get tired after 4 or 5 months. If you want a good fighting game, get Tekken, Mortal Kombat, Soul Calibur, or twisted Metal.( no, I don't work for any of these. I just turned 12 yesterday.)"
1,Stinks Stinks Stinks,"I am a hardcore fighting game fan. This is the only fighting game I really hate. It will get old and annoying. The controls are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to easy and each character neeeeeeeeed more attacks. When the characters are far apart, the characters get smaller and when they are close they are big. I have giving this game to my friend, which was a huge mistake. There needs to be more characters and secrets. I do not recommend this game. I reccomend Tekken, Mortal Kombat, Soul Calibur, or Twisted Metal games. Who are you going to believe, me,a hardcore fighting game fan, or someone who never played fighting games before?"
1,Poorly Made,"This game could really have been a winner, but it seems like Nintendo rushed this through production for some reason. What Super Smash Brothers ended up being was a poor 2-D fighting game, using the notable names of NES characters in order to sell it to gamers. The characters look bad, the fighting looks bad, and it's extremely easy to beat. I went through ever level of difficulty on the game in under two hours. A waste of time and money. 1/5"
1,Too much cartoon violence,"As a parent, I bought this for my 7 year old based on the E rating. I misunderstood that this was a cross between super cart mario and mortal combat. I thought it would be like bumper cars! It is just plain fighting, kicking, punching between the characters. I hate it. Unfortunately, the kids all seem to like it."
5,Super Smash Brothers is Super Awesome Brothers!,"Its awesome the way you fight and if you get enough wins you get NESS-the best character ever! NESS is from the ultra-rare Super Nintendo game,EarthBound!(i actually own both) While I am writing this i am listening to earthbound music. IT RULES ALL COMBAT GAMES! NOW CLASH EM'!"
4,"good, but not the best...","`kay, when I first played this game, I was HOOKED. I finished the game 3 times and unlocked jigglypuff and captain falcon. These WERE my favs:1. Samus Aran2. Link3. Fox McloudWELL, It was my fav. game until ... it was june 5, 2003, I got... MORTAL KOMBAT: TRILOGY!!! THAT WAS THE RREEAALL BOMB!I LIKED STRYKER, SCORPION, NIGHTWOLF, AND MANY MORE!so, it was da 2nd best."
4,A game that will definately show you a good time...,"What can I say? Smash Bros. is just an awesome game. This is the only game you can get where all of your favorite Nintendo characters come together on one screen and battle it out. I recommend calling over 3 more of your buddies and playing it because this game is nuts when 4 players go head to head.Overall I give Mario Smash Bros. 4 stars. I took off a star because after you obtain the 4 missing characters, the game is basically over. You can still battle with your friends, but like most games, it starts to get old after a while. I recommend it for ages 5 - 15."
4,My kids pay this game more than any other...,"This game is the one my kids play more than any other on their Nintendo. They have other games, they rent other games, but they keep coming back to this one.They like the two player option. They like the challenge (they're not teens yet). They like the many characters that can be chosen from different games. They like being able to set their and the opponent's skill levels. They just love this game!I personally wish it were a little less violent, but compared to other games out there, this is a teaparty. So if you're a parent looking for a fun game that will give your kids hundreds of hours of play and one they won't get tired of, buy this game."
4,Not on the top of the list,"This game is pretty good. It's a fun game to play with your freinds, and that's all you can really do after you get the hidden characters. The 1p mode is not that hard. If I can beat it (and I'm not that good at video games) then anyone can."
4,Simple and Fun Gameplay,"All the moves in this game are wonderfully easy. If you learn one, you learn them all. But you have to master the nuiances of the characters to be able to play well. As a multiplayer game, there are very few games that compare to this one, but as anything else, it gets old quickly."
4,Finally a good fighting game on the N64,"SSB is an original fighter that is always fun to play. It has four unlockable characters, one unlockable arena, and some other secerets. The only bad part is it is a little to easy(even on very hard). But this game is addicitive. Short Version: Graphics: 4.4 Sound: 4.2 Control: 4.3 Fun Factor: 4.7 Total: 4.4"
5,I'll kick you stuffed Boot-ey!,"THIS GAME IS HILARIOUS! THE DEAL? YOU PLAY AS STUFFED ANIMALS, SHAPED LIKE NINTENDO STARS, OR I should REALLY say is, ""Beanie Baby"", and knock the living stuffing out of each other! With little violence and powerful COMEDY, this game should surplus 5 stars, I'D GIVE THIS ONE 1,000 STARS AT LEAST AND BY FAR! This game is meant for fun and not violence! FUN BEAT-EM-UP GAME PLAY AND TEAM MATCHES MAKES THIS GAME HILARIOUS! Sadly, I WANTED TO SEE PIT ""KID ICARUS"" IN THIS GAME, MAYBE IN THE THIRD INSTALLMENT OF THIS GAME. SUPPORT ME AND GO TO NINTENDO'S web site and ask, ask, ask! PRETTY SOON, THEY'LL COME WITH THE THIRD GAME AND ""DAI-BIYESSO, DAI-BIYE!"" (FIGHT ON! FIGHT ON!)"
4,"Ok to rent, not so great to buy.","The game is ok. When I rented it for 5 days, it got boring at the last day. My brother got Jigglypuff using DK. I would rent it before buying it. If you like it, buy it."
4,The Best Fighting Game,"Only the best fighting game ever, provides hours of fun for you and you friends. Pick your favorite Nintendo character and start smashin'!"
4,Hours of enjoyment and fun all in one game,"I have to say really do love this game after playing it during a visit to my cousin's home in Texas with my brothers and cousins back in the summer of 2001, I was 100% addicted to this action packed game which was full of exciting and great adventures which I will always remember getting to play for the first time and not being able put the video game paddle and quit playing the video game for less than an hour or more. Second, I have to say my favorite character on the game and forever will be Yoshi (who I believe outnumbers and can destroy Mario, Luigi, Kirby, Donkey Kong and the rest of the gang in a very short amount of time without breaking a sweat). Third and Finally I have to give this game on a scale of one to ten, a ten."
5,I love this game!,"This game was my third game I got and now I have 8 games and I still love it. It is my 2nd favourite game.My favourite guys are: 1 kirby, 2 Fox, 3 Ness. I am pretty good at this game and I can beat anyone 15 miles away. I can beat anyone with fox or kirby.If I could give this a 6th star I would. I think the controls are unique and easy. I like the combo moves that you can do. I really hope there is going to be a sequel. This game is all around fun. bottom line: GET THIS GAME!"
3,Oldie but goodie!,Excellent oldie. Brings my bro and me back to the good ole days! Newer versions for newer systems are available. But only because of the success of this version!
4,I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED,This game was highly dispicable. I had a horrible time playing super smash bros. the game was extremely boring and it had no point in it. all i did was fight against other stupid cartoon characters. i think this game gets a four ONLY because it is extremely easy...so i was able to beat it. the bad part about it being easy is that i can not concentrate and get a good full length time of playing because it is so very dull. thank for this opportunity to express my feelings about this horrible..terrifying game.
4,A Pretty Good Game,"In this game there are several different things to do. One is fight another player(or several other players). Two is practise against the computor. And three is a one player game agaist the computor. In the one player game you go against about ten players played by the computor. If you beat the final boss(the Master Hand) you can fight a mystery player. If you beat this mystery player you get to fight with him. These four mystery players are:Loigy, Ness, Captain Falcon, and Jigglypuff. Aside from these mystery players you can fight with eight players you get at the start. At the most you can verse three other players."
4,Great personal combat game,"This is a great personal combat game, especially for children. I much prefer Tekken, but this game is also fun. There is no blood or gore. You chose from characters that star in other Nintendo games, and each has their own powers. My sons (ages 6, 8 and 10) love this game. Highly recommended for children (and adults)!"
5,best yet,This is one of the funnest battle games ever made. If you get this you will have four extra charectors to earn in one player mode. You can be samus or picachu or mario and more. You can use pokemon to battle within your battle. It is worth the cost.
5,The Best! Unbeatable!,"Smash Brothers, I would have to say, is one of the only games I've played that can be compared with Zelda64, maybe it even blows it away. If you have played Nintendo long enough to know all the characters from the games, you will simply adore this game, no questions asked. However, I wouldn't suggest this to new gamers, because to them it would lack the magic of all the characters from different worlds coming together, because they simply wouldn't be familiar with the characters. But this highly addictive game is perfect for those who are big nintendo fans. No annoying save the world from destruction, no save the princess from the big bad guy, I can't find any flaws with this game. Don't miss it."
3,Okey for a while,"If you love Meele, you will not enjoy this. If you have this you would say it was fun for about.... 3 weeks. 4 maybye. I think the game is excellent but it was'nt addicting at all. But Meele is still my favourite game and is fun to play. So buy it if you hate being addicted."
2,It is Incomplete,This game has a goood 2 player mode but the 1st player mode is poor. The game seems like it was rushed and never finished. One of the characters on the 1st player ladders is fighting polygons. Just monotoned polygone that attack you. The graphics are below adverage for N64 games. Each character has 2 special moves. I was disapointed and would not buy this game.
4,Review of Super Smash Bros.,I think this game is a lot of fun when with friends. It's pretty boring if your solo. The bad thing is this barely has any characters and since the N64 controller is pretty simple so there aren't many moves. The good thing is there is a lot of explosives which I tend to like.
5,"BEST GAME,WOW,OH,INCREDIBLE,DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE IT!","When I started playing It was incredible,OK,you win everything and classic gets boring but playing vs with my friends,the fun doesn't stop, was great starter of the other ones!"
3,pretty good,"This game is great fun, especially if you've ever wanted to see the nintendo characters up close together, or just like simple, fun multiplayer. I like the powerups especially, like the home run bat from earthbound, a lightsaber, a bobomb, etc... However, there are some cons to this game as well. Mainly, for all other people claim differently, the characters arent balanced. Link with an experienced player will whoop most other characters, and certain characters, such as the big and lumbering donkey kong are way easier to knock off the edge. Also, some characters like the unlockable jiggly puff are lame, single player is boring, and some of the arenas are tiny, making it near impossible to avoid getting knocked off if your character lacks some sort or float or teleport move. Still, great fun can be had by all. Also, samus is balanced in this one, as opposed to smash bros. melee where she has been nerfed."
5,One of the Best and Must-have games for the N64 Console,"If you see this game around Immediatly purchase it on the spot. this game can provide hours and hours of multiplayer fun. (1 player is boring but better than playing multiplayer by lonesome) there a alot of unlockable characters that are pretty cool here tehy are: Captain Falcon from F-zero series, Ness from the rare Earthbound series, Jigglypuff from pokemon, Luigi from the Mario Bros. series, And if you have a gameshark there are cool codes the allow you to be the boss of the Smash Bros. titles, (Master Hand) and you could also be Metal Mario with a Gameshark. cool huh? have fun and train. This isn't one of those titles you can just rent and enjoy you gotta own it for it to be fun."
4,"'Tis fun, yet Melee rocks more","This game is pretty fun, but when Super Smash Bros Melee came out, I dumped this game with all the other abandoned ones. Melee's wonderful graphics, amazing sound, and extensive amount of characters really made the older version seem...sucky. But believe me, if it were still 1999, I'd most definetely buy this game."
5,Simply the best,"Super Smash Bros is possibly the best game of Nintendo history. Its got 'em all Pokemon, Link, Mario, Kirby, Star Fox and even Donkey Kong. If any of you out there are big Nintendo fans I'd say its simply the best N64 game of History"
3,Its a melee all right i really did not cling to it.....,"it was nice to see some of the greatest Nintendo characters come togeather in one game but all else form that this game is just to make your eyes sore!!! again i say these kinda games are for kids plain and simple.The game repetitive , annoying , trivial and of course my favorite definition meaningless to me, i felt that alot more could have been done to make this game a great classic, but only the characters can stand out!!!! nothing else, not even the game play, my little bro loves this game so i guess it's worth a play if you have an infantile intellects laterzzzz folks / gamers"
3,...OK...,It's a great game but not my type and it was entirely toeasy. I had it beat in 2 hours. I reccommend it to thosewho like those kinda games...
5,the best,"this game is the funest game ever people would pay 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,111,111,111,111,111,111,999dolars to play one level of this game!

4,great fun lots of choice,its great tons of choices of your favorite charictars and level select its controls are pretty simple but it may take some time if you are younger thiers item select for favorite things you want and they tell you how the charachtars were made and theirs no blood or anything goorey like that but its not real fun with just one player thats why i gave it four stars
4,12 powerful characters,Okay there is only one bad thing about this game. So now there is meele and 25 characters! but there is only 12 in the other. I am best with Captin Falcon. I am worst at Pikachu. Please Please Please do not laugh at my reiview. I am only 9!
5,Super Smash Bros.-Greatest game of all time,"When I say Super Smash Bros. is the greatest game of all time, I don't mean that it's more fun than any other game- I mean that it's VERY fun- and also still one of my most frequently played games after almost 4 years (and I have quite a bit of games to choose from). It's a classic, and the only thing capable of replacing it is the sequel on Nintendo's upcoming GameCube console (which I will make every effort to get :) This game is must-have for anyone who owns a Nintendo 64 (unless you'd like to wait on the sequel)."
5,Best Game,"Smash Brothers is a really fun game. Especially double player. It is really fun playing one player, too. A good player to start out with is Kirby. He has really good moves. Or Link is good too. I got a nintendo when I was in second grade and one of the first games I ever got was Smash Brothers. Now I'm older and I still like it. But I still haven't beat the Hand."
5,Super Smash Bros. N64,"The game that started the Smash franchise.If you still own/play on an N64, this game is a must have.Endless hours of smashing your friends, this game never gets old!"
4,Great,Great Multiplayer Fun. Classic. Lacking in general replay value but so much fun in a group. Four more words yep.
4,This game is the best of the N641,"This game is very entertaing, and is the best multiplayer bash of 1999, and it might do the same for 2000. The fact that you can plays as many skilledand cute characters from Nintendo isnt original, but its one that everyone seems to love. You could be Mario, Samus, Link, and many other different characters! Getting the secret characters is a real fun thing to do because they kick big time! The one final draw back: It's twenty minutes long in one player. This isnt a bad thing because tis game is really meant for multiplayer purposes. But if you are alone, you could sweep through hard mode in less than 25 minutes...not always the best thing. That is why this game got 4 stars instead of 5 from me. Rent it for a good party, and have a tournament."
2,Good Response to Problem,"When I received my bread box, it was cracked, splintered and broken beyond repair. I called the company, and the box was replaced IMMEDIATELY. The second arrived in good shape. Being in the packaging business, I am aware that wood products tend to crack and splinter when subjected to sudden changes in temperature and/or atmosphereic pressure --if not packaged properly. When I advised the company of this ""packaging"" problem, they were very appreciative, and I believe will make every effort to insure safe packaging in the future.Colorado Mountain Gal"
3,Does the job,"I bought this to help tidy up my kitchen counter. It did that job. It holds only about one loaf of regular sized bread plus a bit more, which suits my family, but wouldn't work it you needed more storage space than that. It looks fine and the product arrived in fine shape, unlike others who reported shipping damage."
4,excellent,This is an excellent product that has helped our cat slim down from 16lb. to 11.5lb. by feeding him 1.5 cans/day with much water mixed (for his urinary tract). His coat is now shiny and healthy.I give only 4 stars because it's expensive (esp. when combined with shipping) and unavailable in stores.
4,Wilton ten inch,"Great item, durable and decently flexes under pressure. However if your doing a cake I would go with the Wilton 14"" bag the ten won't be big enough."
2,Not Important,"The only reason anyone should pay attention to this is if you want to hear Sully Erna (Godsmack Vocalist) on the drums. He does a really good job, but all of these songs are immature as hell. Just look at the titles to tracks 4-7, particularly 5 and 6. That immediately gives you the idea. The music is good, but good is all that can be said about. I can understand why they broke up; they didn't seem to be going anywhere. Technically the songs are all played very well, but at the end, I'm left with an ""Ok, what can I listen to next?"" kind of feeling. I'm left with an unsatisfied feeling, especially when I kind of hear the same song twice. They had an album previously under the band name Seka, and then they got Sully for this album and a new name. Well, only check this out if you are a Godsmack fan and want to hear Sully on the drums (he's the best thing on this record). Get it used or cheap, otherwise just download it."
3,Disappointing Follow-up,"There once was a band named ""Seka"" that realeased a rather decent album called ""Love Shim"" on Taang Records. They were subsequently sued by the former porn star Seka for using her name. For their next album they changed their name, drummer, and label and put out ""What's in your Mouth"" as ""Strip Mind."" ""Love Shim"" is a lot faster, catchier, and overall entertaining than ""What's in..."", check that out instead."
5,A Must Read,"A Kentucky tradition, historic in content, well written -- all that and creepy too. Freese has done it again!"
2,Eyeguard fogs up fast,"The eyeguard fogs even before I have completed the first set. Even after I try to clean it, it fogs right back, almost within the first point after cleaning it. So, I end up using it for part of the first set, and then it just sits outside the court, totally unusable."
3,Better after flavor.,"I bought this for a dachshund/lab mix. He would only chew it IF I was trying to take it several time. The flavor just wasn't there for him to be interested. So I boiled some chicken broth and waited for it to cool a smidgen and let the nylabone sit in it for 15 minutes. I let it cool completely and now he's happy chewing! I have been watching him closely to make sure he doesn't eat plastic but he's doing great chewing. If you can't get your dog to enjoy it, I suggest trying that."
1,Nylabone,"Below is directly from the product details of what I purchased. When I received the product it was 4 x 1 x .75. Since what I received is clearly not the same as what I ordered, I am returning the product. If they have multiple listings of similar products, they should ensure the discriptions are correct.Product Details* Product Dimensions: 10 x 2 x 1 inches ; 1.2 pounds"
3,Nylabone,The bone was smaller than I expected. My dogs weighs about 16 lbs. He usually destroys his toys within a week or less. He does seems to enjoy chewing on it and it does seem to be more durable than a lot of other chew toys we've tried.
2,Pups don't care for it,"Perhaps it's for dogs that are teeting or already have, but my Dogo Argentino pups from three to five months old don't care for it. Added it to the pile of other wasted purchases."
4,Watch the teeth,"My dogs love these bones in any shape. I have one minnie Aussie that is a ""frantic chewer"". Unfortunately he fractured one of his back large teeth, and we needed to have it pulled. Our vet said that some dogs do break their teeth chewing these bones as they have no ""give"". She suggested rubber Kong type chewing toys."
5,Perfect chew bone,"My little beagle loves to chew. I bought the Nylabone at her vet's suggestion. She destroys most toys because she chews them to pieces, but it takes her longer to diminish the Nylabone until it needs to be replaced."
2,cute but a ripoff,"Your child loves Fresh Beat Band, so you think to yourself: I should buy a full-length movie based on the Wizard of Oz for them to enjoy!Good plan, except this is just 3 different episodes from Season 3, put together into one ""movie"". (I thought it was going to be a movie anyway)So instead of spending $14.99 on this one, you can save a few bucks and buy the three different episodes separately for $1.99/ea."
3,a bit deceiving,"my daughter loves the Fresh Beat Band -- I ordered this thinking it was a movie - based on the description, there were three storylines, but still thought it was just a goofy movie -- turned out to be three separate episodes -- kind of spoiled our plans for a movie night -- although my daugher liked them"
5,Traumeel,I've been using this product for my dog who has hip dysplasia and disc degeneration. I can definately tell a difference. He eats them out of my hand as they have a sweet taste. Nice to know they do not have any side effects with his other meds.
4,Destro & Slowe Burna - True 2 It,Nice album! The track with Nuttso is a classic example of Oakland mobb music! Beats are dope! I recommend this album.
1,"Fascinating story, poorly told.","The facts of the history of jade are fascinating, but here are told with tiring meanderings, overlong explanations of tangential topics, and an ending that featured too much of the authors. A chore to get through."
2,good intentions,"The magazine has good intentions and worthy goals. The photography is awful. The layout, design and printing is so bad as to be distracting. The writing is good for the target audience which would have to be rather good beginning readers because there's scarce little that is attractive to the non-reader (my boys are 3 and 4 so the level of writing in this magazine would need to be read to them). With that said, the writing is neither personal nor authoritative. You get the sense the authors are simplifying or dumbing down a more authoritative source on their subjects than themselves."
1,Not for modern kids...,"This might be good if your kids have never seen a TV set or you're a homesteader, but this isn't designed for today's kids. The themes and stories are very old-fashioned, and the advertised ""computer games"" are instructions for creating games using DOS. Yup, you heard that right, DOS! I can't even remember the last time I used DOS, the 80's maybe? There are many other good children's magazines out there, I'd recommend spending your money on something else."
5,Unique,"If you are a grammy collector, this cd must be on your shelves. One of the earliest sample of grammy winner movie."
4,"Very Durable, alternative to loud plastic tires","We got this for our oldest when he was 1 and it is now being occupied by our third who has to fight his older sister for it sometimes. The best part of our car is that we purchased rubber tread lawn mower tires to replace the plastic ones that people complained about the noise. It's great with the lawn mower tires, so quiet and just use large washers to make up the difference in tire width. Our door does stick and haven't ever figured out how to make it easier so it usually stands a bit ajar but no one seems to notice, never had any problems with it tipping over. I just wish they would realize that the seat should be higher so their feet could actually go under the seat easier when they are moving it themselves. It has been rained on a couple times and yet the siren will resurrect itself when it dries out. We love it."
4,"My son loves it, but...","I cannot believe how long it took for me to assemble this toy! (nearly 2.5 hours!!!) Waiting until the last minute on Christmas Eve probably wasn't the brightest idea I've ever had, but still - 2.5 hours?!?!The instructions were not 100% accurate, not all the holes were drilled out like they were supposed to be (if they were there at all!), the screws provided were all the same length - and I had to learn this the hard way - and, in the end, the steering wheel frequently comes out (the part provided to lock it in place was pretty much ""stripped"" - and thus, useless).My son loves it -- which, in the end is the most important thing -- but, knowing what I know now, I would've paid Toys-R-Us the $10 to have THEM assemble it."
4,Cute little car,"I have to admit, this was quite difficult to assemble. One major problem was that we had to drill our own hole in one of the tires because it was completely sealed. My husband handled everything by himself, thank God, and I would say it took him a few hours to get complete everything. Overall, it is very sturdy and my son utilizes all of the windows as if he were in the Dukes of Hazzard. It is very cute and my son loves the sirens."
4,Fun Police Car,"I got this toy a week ago for my 10 1/2 month old and he LOVES it. Even though he can't push himself around in it, he still loves climbing in and out and opening and closing the door. The only complaint I have is I wish the lights would light up on the top, and the horn on the steering wheel is practically impossible to make squeek unless you bang on it. Other than that, it is a great toy for even little babies!"
4,PROBLEM PUTTING TOGETHER,"Great toy, cute concept. My two year old loves it! However, maybe It was just me, but I felt misled by the lights on top. They have reflectors in them. Not lights. And the speaker...doesn't do anything but play a siren. It was VERY difficult to put together because not all the holes that were supposed to be there for assembly were. My husband created them with his own tools rather than return such a big item that we were half way through putting together"
4,"A stunning book, beautiful knits, but be aware...","If you are a Sue Bradley admirer, be aware Travellers' Yarns and Around the World in Eighty Sweaters are THE SAME BOOK. Exactly. The former was published in England, and the latter was published in the US.That aside, it is a beautiful book, with lovely patterns which could easily be tweaked to fit the 2000s--especially since Intarsia knitting seems to be poised for a come-back."
4,A great fence,"I am very pleased with this fence. The quality was all I expected. The operation is smooth and accurate. I purchased the ""50"" to Right"" model because it was the only one available at the time. Don't know if I'll ever use that capacity, but it is nice to know it's available. I found the installation on a Craftsman 10"" (1970's model)saw to be very straight forward. I had to drill one hole in the cast iron table, but it was easy to accomplish. Set-up and adjustment was simple. All the test cuts I've made have been accurate. I gave the fence 4 stars only because it lacks some of the features of one of it's more expensive competitors. I'm confident the fence will out perform my skill level."
4,Great Rip Fence,"I bought this tool at Amazon.com. I bought this rip fence because I could not align my other rip fence on my new Delta 36-444 Contractors Table Saw. It connected to my table saw with out drilling any holes. It is very accurate. However, when I aligned it I discovered a slight cup in the middle of the fence. Fortunately, It was not enough to prevent good cuts. I may never use the full 50"", but it is nice to know it is there."
3,Vega less than responsive.,"I actually rate the fence itself at four stars, but Vega's customer service was horrible. The inital contact went smoothly. I ordered a saw fence pusher (soon to be available through amazon.com) and a set of fence legs to compliment my newly purchased Vega U50 fence system. The order was placed on 1/5 and I was told to expect delivery on 1/10 or 1/11. I attempted phone contact on 1/17 - 1/20 calling once a day to obtain information on the order status. None of my calls were ever returned. On 1/20 I sent an email that was never responded too. On 1/27 I got home from work and found the items sitting on my doorstep without any explanation of the delay. I can't imagine a company like this staying in business! If you purchase this fence, you better hope you never have to get in touch with the manufacturer."
4,It's worth it if you put it on a good saw,"I bought it because I thought it would help the used Craftsman table saw I bought. It didn't. I shoulda knowed better. Then, like Lester, I bought a Grizzly 1022 which came with a barely adequate fence. Putting a good fence on a cheap saw is dumb. Putting it on a saw with a little mass and muscle that'll hold its adjustments makes a world of difference. The only reason it doesn't get five stars is because I'll have to completely remove the measuring tape and glue in a new one if I want the thing to zero out at the blade. Right now it's a half-inch off and that's a bit frustrating. But that's the worst thing about it. It's dead-on square and it STAYS that way."
1,Awful.,"I didn't think it was possible for a book filled with such clichés and ridiculous plot lines to actually be published. The over-verbalization of every sentence is painful to read and distracting from the story itself. Example: ""Lust jitterbugged in her gusset"". Seriously, what? When I first picked it up, I thought it had actually potential. Admittedly it had a few laugh out loud lines but generally that was ruined by the unrealistic interaction between the characters and the storyline that even the writers from Passions would scoff at. The ending itself caused me to throw the book across the room in utter astonishment that someone had taken the time to edit, publish and market. This is possibly the worst book I have ever read."
1,Don't Bother,"I decided to read this book after reading Kathy's new book, 'To love, honour and Betray' - I should not have bothered.I probably should have read the reviews here first.This book is so very silly, it is full of sarcastic and convoluted sentences, main characters that you never bond with and silly plot lines.I will probably try some of her other books after I can forget about this one!."
1,Horrible,"The plot seemed neat enough, and I thought it would be really good based on that fact, but I was seriously wrong. I didn't even finish the book it was so terrible. I read to chapter 4 in the hopes it would get beeter, but it didn't. It was super confusing with all the verbiage used. It was just too hard to follow along with the sentences with all the superfluous stuff going on. I can't beleive that people actually liked this book! I'm so glad I only checked it out from the library and didn't have to pay even a penny for this one!"
2,Still usable but ugly,"I recieved these as a Christmas gift 3 years ago. My husband knew how much I liked KitchenAid and especially the red line of products. The exterior of all my pots have turned pink. Since a lot of my appeal to this product was the red exterior I am extremely dissappointed. I've not experienced the flaking of the non-stick surface, but I am very strict with utensil usage and everyone knows not to use metal with them... They still cook decent, but next time I will probably go with a different brand."
1,Kitchenaid has gone downhill,"I realize we're all supposed to think Kitchenaid is the very, very best....and it isn't. My set of this cookware looks dreadful after a couple of years, and started looking that way soon after I got it. The outsides are discolored and pitted, the edges worn off, and the nonstick coating is....not nonstick. We are careful with our expensive cookware, but I wouldn't buy Kitchenaid again. It seems to me that they are making more and more tacky, cheap things, as in the plastic measuring cups I purchased, most of which handles have broken off, rendering them unusable. I don't think I'll be buying much Kitchenaid in the future. Will stick with my Farberware and Circulon pans, all of which are still going strong."
5,Pots in Red,"I bought this set of cookwear for my daughter. It was very beautiful, made me want a set for myself. She loves the way they cook, non-sticking."
2,"Still works, but discolored and slightly warped","I got this set as a gift three or four years ago. It still works fine, and I haven't had issues with the non-stick coating flaking off, but the red coating has gotten really discolored from normal use -- black in some places, faded in others. Also, I think the pots have warped a bit. The strainer inserts I have for the pots don't really sit flush in the pot anymore. It's disappointing, because I love my Kitchenaide stand mixer, and I really really loved this set's color. My boyfriend has been trying to convince me for a while now that these are ""garbage."" I suppose it's time to cave in and replace them with a set that won't look so ugly after a year."
2,Dissapointed,"I thought this would be a nice set, because Kitchenaid is always such a reliable brand, but I was wrong. The quality is okay they seemed nice at first but like everyone else said the paint and telfon started chipping fairly quickly. Not worth the money. I will go with something else next time."
1,Misleading,"I am just SO DISAPPOINTED! I wanted to get a 12"" KitchenAid skillet to replace the one I have.. it looked like this set included it... absolutely not!!! Maybe a 9"" skillet in this collection. I do not recommend this product if it is not disclosing of the sizes..BUYER BEWARE"
5,worlds grreatest bags,some damn good bags worth every penny spent never go wrong with thses. takes awhile to break in to em but once u do set for life!!
3,took too long to arrive,It took forever to show up. It works well and is easy to apply. I will probably go to my local drugstore next time.
2,better for a cute gift...,"This is a cute gift for someone who is just getting started in the use of essentail oils and aromatherapy. The box is cute with a couple of candels and a little book, but kinda useless if you are buying it for yourself. Yet, not a total waste at only $20..."
1,"Refilled, Probably fake","I have used this lotion now for about 2 years, from various sources, and this is the first time I have run into what I felt was either a counterfeit product or very old. When I received the bottle, the first thing I noticed is that it was sealed in a shrink wrap. This is not how the lotions are sealed from the factory. Then when I took the shrink wrap off and twisted the top off, the little plastic piece with a hole in it (so you can squirt out the lotion) was removed. I couldn't think of another reason this would be besides they refilled it. Okay, first two things are frustrating, but as long as the product is good, so am I. Well it wasn't. I am very familiar with this product and I can promise it was either counterfeit, old, or watered down.Buyer beware when ordering from this supplier. ITS A SCAM."
2,not my style of management,"I'm sure that this book has several excellent qualitites, but I was introduced to it by a professor who used these strategies exactly as they were outlined in the book. I constantly felt micromanaged, controlled, and manipulated. When I read the book after it was recommended by the professor, I saw exactly where these strategies were coming from. Since I as a student didn't like them at all, I wouldn't inflict these same strategies on my own students. I am a fairly new teacher with only about 4 years of experience, but I still feel like I know the difference between pressuring my students to behave in a particular group pattern and teaching them to think for themselves. I felt like this book took that power away from both the students and the teacher."
2,Not for use with a burn,"I bought this before vacation ""in case of a sunburn"". Well, the burn happened but the spray didn't help. It feels good going on, but the relief is temporary and did not provide the moisture my skin needed. When you look at the ingredients #3 is alcohol...not such a good thing for burned, dehydrated skin. We ended up buying an aloe gel at the gift shop and I feel much better!"
2,working with older adults,It is abit outdated now. Alot of the Older Adults coming in Nursing Facilities for Rehab do not have supportive family to help them connect with a psychotherapist. This book is good in the world of yesterday but the world has changed and the worries are different.
5,Best glass for the price,"This was the optic I chose for my beginner setup. I have been shooting since I was a kid but all of you know that precision shooting is pretty much a different field of shooting. My setup is with a Remington 700 SPS Tactical, Badger Ordnance 20 MOA base, TPS Rings, and this scope. First time I took it out it took me five shots to zero after boresighting. The clarity is amazing, I've hit steel at 600 yards on a good day with low winds. I also put this on my Marlin .22 mag, hit a squirrel in the eye 80 yards away(intentionally). Can't go wrong with this scope."
5,Excellent scope for the money,"I placed this scope on a Remington 700 target tactical rifle. The scope is extremely clear and easy to use. In fact, using a bushnell boresiter, it was the fastest I've ever lined a rifle up. I'm very pleased with the product. Some thing to think about though, you need a scope mount with 20 moa to hit a target at 1000 yards. Niteforce makes an excellent one for 86 dollars. Hope this was helpful."
5,Better than I expected,"I have this scope on my remington 700 sps tactical. I have been using it for over a year now, and it has kept its zero each time I shoot it. I love the mildots and once you learn how to use them, they are incredible for measuring and shooting different distances quickly. The quality of the lens is very good, very comprable with the leupold on my work rifle. After searching the entire internet for a quality scope that did not break the bank, this was it and I am very satisfied. The warranty is also nice to have if you need it. I know I have sent several leupolds away for one thing or another."
5,Incredible value!,I have this scope on my Remington .22-250 and its performance is nothing short of spectacular. This scope offers features that can compete with other scopes costing much more and the quality here isn't compromised. The image is clear and the eye relief is very comfortable. I could easily imagine this scope costing 200-300 dollars more but the folks at Bushnell sure know how to keep a competitive edge!
3,"Good ,but better check out other resources.","Fretboard Logic I and II are two essential books, the ones that open eyes and inspire many AHA moments, however I believe Bill Edwards wanted a total approach, and he extended the concept for the many applications in guitar playing, and this is a bit forced. He does not suceeed in applying the Logic to everything . It is not that bad, but I think there are better options for improvisation, technique, or chord progressions.For Fretboard recognition the two former books are essential.This does do justice to them, but the intentions are good."
4,Kevin Gilbert has nothing to do with this album!,"Okay folks... We seem to be missing the point & confusing a lot of people out there. This album is by the band THIRD Matinee. Not TOY Matinee. This project was a collaboration of Patrick Leonard (originally of Toy Matinee) & Richard Page (originally of 80's band Mr. Mister). Kevin Gilbert isn't on this record. Richard Page is the lead singer and I personally think he does a great job. The songs are all very pop oriented, but a little too slow at times for my taste. If you own Toy Matinee - you need to own this to see what Patrick Leonard went on to do AFTER Toy Matinee. Did I mention that Kevin Gilbert isn't on this album?"
4,Sticks with me after all these years,"Personal taste is just that,...... Personal. But I would describe this as hopeful, sad, yearning, sly. I'm speaking musically, because I'm not usually a lyrics person. I'm more drawn to how the voice interplays with the other instruments. For me this is consistently more pleasing than Toy Matinee, although there are a couple of songs on Toy Matinee that I like more than anything here. And for what it's worth, The Shaming of the True is my favorite album ever, so I certainly mean no slight to Kevin Gilbert. This is just very well crafted and executed music."
5,"Meanwhile, i was still thinking...","Just received my new copy of this fine CD (and listening to it on headphones) since i have either lent out (and lost) or misplaced my original copy from my extensive library. I was the receipent of an annual BEST OF THE YEAR mix CD from 1994 from an avowed musicologist (and friend of mine, Dr. Reptile) which featured two songs from this melodius album. Still tasteful and superbly played by these session aces, the songs resonate to this day with its excellent mix of keyboards, synthesizers, and guitars. Morphing from the disbanded Toy Matinee (which also deserves recognition and a rave review due to the talents of Kevin Gilbert), Patrick Leonard and Richard Page (from Mister Mister) combined for this special disk and it was unfortunately their only release. Highly recommended- may not quite make my top 10 desert island disk but certainly in the top 25 along with Toy Matinee. Check them both out!"
5,Great Rockabilly,"I have seen Two Tons at several venues around Texas, and this CD/DVD captures the feeling of a typical Two Tons honky-tonk show. Their Greune (pronounced 'green') hall shows are legendary. I just saw them at Floore's Country Store in Helotes this New Year's Eve, and the scene was the same. Loads of folks of all ages kicking up their heels to the sound of genuine rockabilly. Highly recommended."
5,The Dissillusionment of the Flower child,"So many people from that generation have taught in our Universities and Public Schools ""the 60's was an era when Peace not war was the goal"". This book clearly details how that notion was blown adrift by the radical, hostile, and hedonistic lifestyles many people ""in the Revolution"" led during that time. After they tore down our institutions (belief in God) and tried to trash our culture(Democracy), they faded into the background. And even now as they reach their twilight years of old age, even now, they look back on what they did and say, ""Hmmm maybe that time was a little excessive""(Jane Fonda). Read this book and it will fill in the ""blanks"" for you as to why the 70's happened and we as a people began to doubt ourselves. And why finally in 1980, Ronald Reagan was swept into office amidst a political backlash against the radical left not seen in this country since the 1950's."
4,A great Collection of episodes. Needs more editing,"The Second Thoughts series is an excellent collection of insightful and damning articles. David Horowitz and Peter Collier are the Emmanual Goldstien of the New Left, except that they are truly damning to the regime.However,Destructive Generation : Second Thoughts About the Sixties is only a collection. While it has an introduction, I believe that more analysis would have been useful to tie the episodes together. I suggest that any fan go to their websight."
1,The Unreal Thing,"David Horowitz and Peter Collier would love for the people that read this book to consider nothing outside of their loathsome view of the 60's. And if judged by the reader reviews they have found their partisans.The New Left as archfiend to Democracy is employed as a synecdoche in H&C;'s tireless effort to deconstruct the era. Readers that impute H&C;'s subjective views are in lockstep with present day efforts by the neo con's to annul the extraordinary social achievements of the 60's generation.This book's transparent viewpoint is another lop sided, subjective hack job by Horowitz who is still trying to prove to his parents that they were wrong and he is right (pun intended)."
1,A jaudiced look at an era.,"What the authors miss is that the ""revolution"" got us out of a stupid, murderous war, got us to accept people of color as humans, caused a backlash against corrupt police and FBI. Made the world a better place. Were the ""leaders"" sexually immoral and driven by ego? No argument there, but our so-called leaders in Washington are not unlike the characters that lead political activism in the sixties. Except they do nothing but keep the status quo."
3,Instructions on Being a Spy,"Ever wanted to be a spy? Well Agent O the world's best spy will teach you how. Agent O is incidentally a little girl but no one knows she is just a kid. Agent O recounts the tale of how she thwarted criminal mastermind Felicia's plans to rule the world. Following O's adventure she leaves many a code for the reader to crack as well as dropping hints on surveillance, how to know if someone has been in you room, disguises, how to observe others, tail someone and other essential spy stuff. Detailed instructions on how to construct many spy accessories and equipment are also included. The story does lack a bit of substance but the activities will keep many a child entertained for days."
5,Very great description of the Middle East,"This is a very insightful book regarding the Middle East and understanding the culture. I would recommend for anybody wanting to understand it better and what is going on to read it. Of course each author has their own view points about Right and Wrong and even if you don't agree with his idea about the place of the US in the world, it still will give great information and a great understanding of the what is going on today and where we are headed.Having lived in the Middle East for a long time and being married to an Arab Muslim I could say he does very well. Of course each country in the Middle East is unique and different as are each state in the US with the culture of the people in the states having sub cultures, if one wants a general easy over view this book provides just that."
2,"Sorry, I did not like this","I went to see it because of its high recommendations among reviewers, but frankly I left the theatre feeling cold, disillusioned, sad and disappointed. I like to feel good after watching a movie... and I felt, well, empty and disappointed I spent my $$ on it."
1,Hated this movie,"This struck me as more porn than art....bad story line, so-so acting and disgusting scenes. Give me Pride and Prejudice any day."
2,Skip if you like mainstream movies,This movie is not for you if you like mainstream movies shown at the commercial theaters. The opening sex scene which was likely meant to seduce the audience was a turnoff. The storyline was not immediately revealed and failed to keep my interest. I've hesitated to review it because I disliked it and ended up turning it off. I am not a critic just an average viewer sharing my opinion.
1,Hollywood Does It Again.,"As a forty year resident of Los Angeles I've learned just how jaded and inbred the Hollywood Movie System has become: ""Blue Valentine"" is one of the many ""products"" dumped on American society these days. Is this an accurate representation of contemporary love/marriage? Yep, Hollywood style. Absolute garbage. I am sorry for the fathers of all the young girls in America who have to live down to the standards Hollywood has created. All for greed and selfishness. Pathetic."
1,***AWFUL MOVIE******,"Quite possibly one of the worst I've seen.....completely plotless, difficult to follow. Reminds me of a B movie that goes straight to DVD. Appears to be about a married couple going through some difficulties....but really, who can tell? And who can stay awake long enough to confirm? Really awful.....save your money and wait for it to come on cable if you're so inclined. I really would recommend skipping this movie entirely.DYB"
1,should be rated x,This was the worst movie I've ever seen. Too many disgusting sex scenes. Might as well go rent a porno or something. Even that would be more entertaining than this trashy movie.
5,One of the best movies - Real and raw - relationships are not disney movies,I do not want to give anything away about this movie. If you have ever longed and or longed for someone---this movie captures that feeling. I find this movie to be for people who want a glimpse of good/bad/reality of life. Great film!
3,Good Film,I enjoyed this film. It was very real and fairly interesting. They sort of remind me of my parents so it was an interesting film to say the least.
3,Can't decide if this movie merits a 5 star or a 1 star review,"As far as film itself goes this is a superior movie. The acting is extremely good, the dialgoue is well written, the direction and shooting are both above par, and the story is believable. However as well crafted as this film is the story itself is of a different nature. I found the story extremely depressing, and while it was a nice tale, it definatly holds no replay value. There's no reason to come back and watch this movie more than once unless you're a film student or something of the kind and want to examine the film for the sake of film. A must see but not a must own. My suggestion is to rent it, watch it once, be prepared to hurt a bit, and enjoy the quality of performances."
2,"Depressing, but acting was well done.",Tough story line to follow and sad story. Wasn't crazy about it and felt the couple's saga dragged on with out a point.
2,I wanted it to be so good...,I had such high hopes for this film and I was SO sad to be let down. I love the actors and they normally do so well and actually the acting is very good! They play their parts well and they totally become the character. It's the story that let me down. The story begins well and is rather exciting but it sort of dwindles at the end and you're left a feeling that there should be more to it.. but there isnt. Please rent this before you buy it or you may be sorely disappointed.
2,To Be Avoided,"Even though I am an longstanding afficionado of off-beat independent films, this one was really a major disappointment. In fact, the theater was largely empty despite the fact that this movie is an Acadamy Award nominee.The main issue is that the dialogue is muffled and mumbled in many scenes. and the action itself is frequently devoid of meaning or difficuly to decipher. Moreover, the length of the film is esxcessive given the ephemeral nature of the plot.I should add that the switching from ""past"" to ""present"" and vice versa is annoying. The only high point was the cuteness of the little daughter. Some critics also have praised this film's depictions of physical intimacy, but I frankly didn't notice anything out of the ordinary."
1,Sad and depressing,this is one of the most depressing and pointless movies I have seen in a long time. The best actor was the little girl. I couldn't even finish it because I could have cared less what happened to the pathetic main characters.
2,Not a love story!,"This movie is touted as a love story, and that's what I was expecting to see. HOWEVER, it's a disappointing story about a man desperately in love, a woman who doesn't return his love but uses him when her life hits a snag, and the relationship problems such a coupling encounters. The dialogue is lousy, and there are a few degrading sex scenes thrown in for good measure. I definitely will not view this movie again and do not recommend it."
1,Terrible movie,"I can't believe people liked this movie. I rented it because I thought Ryan and Michelle would provide some good acting. Michelle's character is in a marriage that she chose not out of love. Ryan's character really did love her, but she treated him like dirt and the movie tried to make it seem like it was his fault - but really, she was the jerk in the relationship. Why do I want to waste my time watching two people who are pathetic?"
1,Boring film,"This film is only going to be interesting to serious film buffs who are tired of the usual Hollywood trickery of showing an interesting story that actually flows, making the appropriate use of flashbacks and a dialogue that isn't forced to capture a more realistic sense of boredom around anticlimactic events. I really tried to pay attention to this thing but I became so bored that I just sat and worked throughout most of it.That said, I didn't actually pay for this movie. A resentful ex friend who delusional believes that we were in a relationship at one time overnighted it to my home on my birthday. So, I guess it was a birthday gift and all that I am really out of is the time wasted sticking it in DVD player and deciding how to occupy myself until the credits rolled. Perhaps I will resell it on here? I see that plenty of others enjoyed it so why not?"
1,Skip it.,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Not one to watch again at all. Weird, confusing and twisted all in one movie."
3,Blue Script,"It was full of questions at the end and William's role needed more dialogue. Ryan Gosling is always great and of course eye candy!I did enjoy Ryans's relationship with his daughter which was sweet and humorous. Also it was nice to see a husband want to do what ever he could to save the marriage, but unfortuneately it was to late."
2,Disc Did Not have a Slip Cover,This disc came in just a black case and did not have a slip cover for it. It's worth mentioniong that during the time of sale or at least be creative and find one on the internet to print out.
4,Brilliant performances by Gosling and Williams elevate this to art,"Intensely real performances from Michelle Williams and especially Ryan Gosling (one of the finest actors working today) make this one a near must-see ... even if it's not the most uplifting film; certainly NOT a date movie! They play Cindy and Dean, a married couple with a young daughter who appear to be in the last days of their marriage, having grown apart and uncommunicative in the years they have been together. But the film flashes back and forth, from around the time they met and through their courtship and falling in love, to who they are now as a couple, and in the process becomes nothing less than a blueprint for how true love can fall apart. Dean fares as the much more sympathetic character, but overall the film is a master class in acting thanks to the two leads, who are truly brilliant here."
3,Sad Sad Sad,"This is just a sad movie about the death of a marriage, hopes and dreams. This relationship was destined to fail even before it started. Cindy had hopes and ambitions. She wanted to be a doctor. Dean had no ambitions and was happy to have a job that let him drink a beer at 8 am. When Cindy tries to discuss his potential, he is at a loss. He is content the way he is. When she realizes the doctor has hopes to sleep with her and is not interested in her abilities, it is the final straw and her parience is gone.What saves this movie is the wonderful acting of Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling. I cannot remember a movie with two finer performances. Their portrayal is so realistic, so heartbreakingly fine that it literally took my breath away. Colin Firth was great this year but I think Ryan Gosling's performace outshone and outdanced his by miles.This movie was without hope but for a chance to see stellar acting, you might want to watch it."
4,"Very moving, yet depressing",This is definitely worth watching. The two leading actors make it well worth the time spent. Keep in mind this film is Rated R and is not suitable for young children.Highly recommended!
3,Nothing new here...,"This movie is pretty much a modern day 'Revolutionary Road.The story is as old as Methuselah, but the heavy nudity makes if bearable."
2,movie,Watched this once. Didn't like it. Gave it to charity. Hope they found someone to like it more than I.
2,"Sad, depressing, nothing happy to pass on","It is well acted. It is sad. It is depressing. It is not for me. Others think it has positive things in it, but I did not see them. Maybe that is today's society for most, but it is not where I want to dwell or even think of. It was a mistake for me to view it. Sorry I can' recommend other than saying these young actors really did depress me....and since they are well paid Hollywood people they don't have much to complain about in their daily lives. Must be good acting."
4,blue vagentine,"this is like porn,, the sex scenes are brutal and the camera angles are very voyeuristic -its like you are between them as they have sex"
1,Ugh - Boring waste of time,"Wife is no longer interested in husband - she eventually leaves him. That's it - the whole movie. It just grinds along. Good acting, but virtually no plot. Dreadfully boring - I had to fast-forward."
1,Tedious and overrated!,"Awful! One of the most overrated movies I've seen in ages. I have not one good thing to say about this movie except it's been done better so many times. Try ""Scenes from a Marriage"" by Bergman. The characters are stickboard figures with a dreary incomprehensible script and actors who do nothing to make the movie move! Same dialogue over and over again. If I had to choose (why would I) I would say my sympathies go to Dean. I think he had more feelings than Cindy.I was watching my clock to see when it would end simply because I must have been in a mood to inflict suffering upon myself. Do something more useful with your time: sit and watch a flower grow!"
2,Not a film about love at all,"Acting is first class. Of course, the attractive & superficial looks of both actors are bound to draw you inBut it is a dark story, with characters one can only struggle to feel any sympathy forThe film shows the pain and obvious destruction resulting from certain types of behaviour. So the outcome becomes more predictable the longer the film runs, and I became more and more disinterested in the characters with every minute"
5,"My 36"" Professional Lathe Duplicator","The Vega D-36 - 36"" Professional Lathe Duplicator was a very good choice for me. I had an old bed post leg that was splitting and breaking apart. I read all the instructions, set up the tool, put the leg on the duplicator and made an exact match the first time. I feel like the other review given the diamond V tool would have been the best, which I am going to purchase one soon.The speed chain to move the head is a so much better than a web belt found on the Delta's Lathe Duplicator. All of the other add on tool accessories are great, especially the router attachment which I can see potential in my shop."
5,Good Choice,"Purchased the duplicator through Tool Crib. The duplicator and all its parts are top quality. I am an amateur on the lathe but was able to produce some very good turnings with this product. The duplicator was very easy to install on my lathe. My only gripe would be that the instructions could have been better for both operation and template construction. I am still in a learning mode, but this product is not that difficult to use. Just keep the bit sharp and the lathe speed correct."
3,Mommie Dearest is a bad book for some people to read.,"I give this book 3 stars for the mixed emotions I have about it. While I would like to say, once started I couldn't put the book down. Unfortunately however, was the abuse I endured from this book. My own mother, after reading this book, took some of the examples Christina gave, and used them on my sister and myself. I'm not going to say without this book we would not have been abused, I know that would have happened regardless. It's just scary to read some of the similarities in abuse and to relive them. For those that have been abused as a child, adopted or not, this book may be a very emotional one for you. Take caution before reading it. Mothers do indeed do terrible things to their children when not viewed by the public eye. If anything positive can come out of this book, it is the spotlight being put on child abuse in the home."
2,The Golden Age of Hollywood Was Not So Golden,"The golden age of Hollywood was not so golden. Some of Crawford's friends disputed Christina's book. In particular, Myrna Loy, Joan's friend since 1925, became one of her staunchest defenders in the aftermath of the book. Other stars such as Helen Hayes, June Allyson, Bette Davis, and Betty Hutton have verified some of the stories in Christina's book. Hutton had previously lived near Joan Crawford's Brentwood, California, home and has stated that she saw the children during or after various moments of abuse. On the internet there are many pictures of Joan and Christina and they seem friendly. I believe like many abusive parents she mellowed with age. This book is a horrible indictment of the old Studio System. Louis B. Mayer and the blue suits in the Thalberg bldg at MGM knew the children's plight but hushed it up."
3,"Good read, but distracting!","While I was fascinated by the details of Christina's horrific upbringing, I was continually distracted by the editor's horrific job of weeding out the passages that were riddled with errors! Not only was the language slaughtered, but the spelling was an embarrassment. Apparantly, Christina's childhood was so traumatic, she couldn't focus clearly on the mechanics of writing. Her English teachers who have read the book must be mortified. Also, she included details that I found irrelevant to the story; it seems she was using some of her ""cute"" asides for her own gratification, not the reader's. Still, it was a fascinating study of a woman with money, fame, and power and how it blinded her to the most important treasure of all; family."
4,Crawford,"Took a courageous spirit to write a book such as this. I wish that Christina would address the rumor I read that she may have been one of the stolen babies Georgia Tann stole, that monster. Crawford clearly only wanted kids as an accessory, a way to make herself look good."
1,Look before you leap,"I bought this from CPO and it's a nice unit. Problem is that the CPO and Amazon sites don't explain that this is Right Tilt only so I can't use it. The CPO site says the 963 is for contractor saws, and that may be, but it is not for Left Tilt contractor saws like my 36-979.Talked to Delta looking for the right part number, and it appears with all the merger activity their inventory systems are a mess, and they can't even identify which part number you need for a Left Tilt spreader. Actual production of the correct one shouldn't take very much. They would need to machine one part of the bracket a bit different, so I have to believe that at some point someone did that, but it doesn't seem to be available.If someone knows the answer, post it so we all know."
1,Poor Design - Don't Buy It.,"I bought it...but wish that I didn't. The base metal is soft and bends very easily. I found it impossible to get it aligned with my thick kerf blade. I messed around with it way too long. It caused binding between my saw and fence since it was slightly leaning to the right. The bracket could not adjust it based on the pivot area. The anti-kickback pawls would catch in the standard Delta Unisaw insert slot, so use a zero clearance with this product. The bracket attachment slot needed to be filed for it to release with the pull-pin, there was about .005"" of interference right from the factory. The attachment scheme is weak in design, it requires several washers to be mounted. Don't waste your money or time. Buy a bearing-buddy or similar and make sure that your fence is parallel to your blade - this is most important. Amazon does have the best price."
3,Good but expensive,I like the easy of removing the snap in spreader once installed. I had to enlongate the mounting holes slightly as it did not line up with my saw. I did this with much anxiety as the cost is excessive and I was hoping it would not be ruined. It does work fine although any sideward movement on the outboard outfeed eaisly bent the kick back paws. I had to bend it back into the original position.
4,Nice but over priced.,"An easy install it only took me about 15 minutes. I suppose that is because I have the contractor saw and can reach the bolts from underneath. It works great, wish I had one sooner and probably would have if they were not so pricy.Biesemeyer stuffed the wrong spreader in the box first go around but Amazon got the correct one to me pretty fast. Good job Amazon!I rated this four stars because of the price and the fact the first one was a foul up by Biesemeyer."
2,Useless with Thin Kerf Blades,"I knew it was overpriced, but then that's to be expected with Delta (which now owns Biesmeyer) :( But the worst of it is that the spreader portion measures .120"". Thus, thin kerf blades can not be used with this product. I called the manufacturer to see if a thin kerf spreader was available: it is not. With a major investment in thin kerf blades and no desire to go back to .125"" kerf blades, I either machine down the spreader (more$$) or return it and do without. Hmmm......"
2,Less is More,"Fine book for fans with an interesting look into Thomas's life before London, but not one I would recommend for someone new to the series. Too many characters and a complicated (and boring) plot about the exploitation of Africa by Europeans. I had a hard time sticking to it and I don't usually struggle to get through Perry's work. Really not one of her best."
3,An undemanding romp through Victorian society,"This is a late entry in the author's Thomas and Charlotte Pitt series and is best appreciated by longtime fans, who will enjoy meeting familiar faces enough to forgive the dullish plotting. Newer readers will be charmed by Perry's vivid characters and her knack of contrasting their real selves with the requirements of Victorian society -- but the dramatic tension this usually generates is missing here, except in a couple of scenes near the end. A fun read, but not an involving one."
3,It *could have* been good.,"To be honest, I grabbed this CD as a novelty. I mean... Swing from Japan, how can one refuse!? Upon hearing the CD several times, I've come to the conclusion that they have promise, but their largest failing is their lead vocal. While she does have a lovely voice, it sounds to me like she doesn't speak English at all, or at least not well, & is simply mimicking the sound of the lyrics. Her mispronounciation makes the otherwise alright band unlistenable. Now, what *would have* been cool is if she had taken that voice of hers & scrapped the English lyrics, replacing them with a Japanese translation. That would surely have been much better, & admittedly more novel. I rated it a 3 because it would be good, but..."
5,"A wonderful, long-lasting fragrance","I love flowery scents--my favorites being Joy and YSL Paris-- and this one with its notes of lilies of the valley is exquisite. I also love how long lasting the scent is--I really don't need to use a lot nor reapply it during the day. My one complaint is the bottle shape. It is awkward to hold one-handed and spray. A longer neck or slimmer body would have solved ths problem or even a smaller bottle to begin with. That said, I've gotten multiple compliments about this scent and it really has become my signature."
1,overwhelmingly bad,"this is not anything that I would recommend to anyone, nor would I wear it. as soon as I put it on, I immediately had a strong negative visceral reaction. I tried to wash it off, but it would not wash off. Finally after a few hours, it has disappeared. Think carefully before purchasing. It smells nothing like fresh lily of the valley."
3,Great seller but item was not as described.,"Great seller-I needed the book in a hurry and the seller was very accommodating. Unfortunately, the book was described as ""Excellent-Like New."" This was not the case. The book is in great condition but many of the pages had writing on them. Considering the fact that this is a workbook, it is pretty distracting to see what someone else filled in for the answers. I would have paid more for a book that did not contain writing. This seller needs to consider the definitions on Amazon for their criteria of Like New, etc."
2,Another worthless book!,Another ECG book with terrible illustrations of ECG rhythms that are hard to read. They are in black & white and fuzzy! This book is also over-priced! This is also another ECG book that is witten like a childrens book! The only good part of this book is that it has flash-cards on ECG rhthyms and cardiology meds. Please don't waste your money!
5,"Top or Side Terminal,This Is The Battery For You!","You can't go wrong with this battery. No acid messes,no water to add,just plenty of power to start and run your vehicle and its options,no matter what you drive.3 year free replacement package,after that monthly proration based on months used for 6 years.Great trouble free, worry free battery."
1,Don't waste your money,I have purchased 3 of these for 3 different vehicles and after 2 years all 3 fail to retain a charge and start the vehicle if it sits more than a few days. My traditional Exide battery in one of my other vehicles preforms much better and is older.
1,Puh-leeze. Warmed over pop and half-baked ideas,"I can't belive people buy into thinking these guys are any good. You have to go the Pooh Sticks to find a more derivative band, ripping off ""influences"" from all over the place and trying to sell it to the ""kids"" as new (who are probably dumb enough to believe it)."
3,A look at the Anthology,"This book is a very good source on published writings from numerous authors, and all combined for a reader's interpretation. It runs from a broad selection of work from classical authors like William Shakespeare to more modern writers such as August Wilson. The selection of works are of poems, short stories, and plays; each section is separated into those categories so there will there be less confusion in finding a story, or a poem."
5,"Rock on. Chill out. Get funky. All on the one, great album.","Nothing but absolute praise for Andy Spence's fine work on Last One Home. I first heard ""Play to the Music"" and couldnt stop rocking (it has a small part in the movie Swordfish) and then I heard ""Nurega"" on the movie the Fast and the Furious and when I realized they were by the same creator, I knew the album would be magic. Like electronica that can be funky and chilled? You'll love this effort."
4,It works,"The case works well, and it looks nice. My only complain is that the case I received didn't have working lights on the front. I'm kind of disappointed in this because I ordered the case not only for the use, but for the looks. It looks like I could've saved $50 ordering a cheaper case."
1,ONE GOOD SONG! ONE STAR EARNED!,"Quite frankly, in my opinion, there is only one good song inthis album, and actually the only song I was interested in tobegin with when I purchased this CD.The song is: ""Hush My Baby""The rest of the CD is boring!"
2,Disappointing.,"I purchased the CD before seeing the movie, on the strength of KD's previous talent, alone. I was expecting more in the vein of ""Absolute Torch and Twang"" and was disappointed. I might've listened to it a total of twice since the purchase. Oh well."
4,Good cross section sample & excellent search starting point,"Just started reviewing but I already know that I have made a significant step in the right direction in my quest to find the kind of music that I like and adore. I have come over from the Ubiquity side of the search: DJ Greyboy, slide five, etc. but need more with different flavor. This is seriously helping the issue!"
3,Decent but Dead,"Certainly, the tracks are cool and trippy. But this is a soul-less compilation. I am, or at least I was, a big fan of the Guidance label, but these tracks are just too empty. The recipe is played out: 2 parts dubby bassline, 1 part reverb, a sprinkling of percussion and add some ""cool"" vocal loops. Perhaps I'm jaded, but ""lounge"" music has to have more life than this: it's just not very interesting, even as background music. You'd be better off with the DJ Kicks Thievery Corporation album for a similar style, but with some heart."
5,Awesome Cookware Set,"I love this set!! After years of struggling with trying to remain loyal to Reverware I finally gave up. Cheap pans, handles that constantly break and annoying copper bottoms that need constant maintenance -- enough is enough. This set is great. It's well-built, well thought-out and a good, solid design. The structure of the pans feels solid -- good quality. The lids are glass, which means you can just glance at your food, rather than constantly lifting the lid to check on it (and disturbing the temp). The glass is so clear it looks invisible. The handles have comfortable grips, which reduces stress on the hands and arms (heavy lifting is much easier). Cleanup is a breeze--low maintenance. Plus, if anything goes wrong, they come pick it up and send you a new one. It would've been great if it was dishwasher friendly, but other than that, I'd recommend this to anyone who is looking for a smart solution to affordable cookware in the kitchen."
3,Adequate assimilation of theory and text.,"Only recommended to hardcore theorists and devoted Pynchonites (if those two titles can possibly coincide). Although I don't find the theory particuarly engaging, someone may.............this book is for you, but not me. Berressem is thorough in his evaluation, and the book isn't a difficult read. Overall, a mild recommendation."
2,Thin material,"Not sure what the previous reviewer was talking about, but this filter is not comparable to the stock filter. This is a whole lot thinner. I ended up just vacuuming the original filter and wrapping one of these on top of it as a pre pre-filter. I would not recommend this product."
1,Feeling a little misled....,"These filters are not Honeywell #38002...they are a generic brand. The picture shown above is exactly how I received them...no protective covering, no labels, etc. We also had to cut them to fit our filters (We have 3 Honeywell 50520's). We are using them in our filters now, but I'm guessing that they won't last as long as the true Honeywell ones. These filters seem to be less dense as the originals, and seem to let more dust run through. It should state in the product description that they are not true Honeywell filters. Don't waste your money..."
3,Not Honeywell!,Not sure how the quality will be but these come bulk packed in clear plastic. Will try them and see how they work.
4,Good buy.,A little thin but works well. They noticeably reduced the musty smell in our house. Not a bad price for the quality of the product.
5,Looks Good,Product arrived faster than estimated. Best price available for product. I keep 2 or 3 filters on the shelf and use when the old filter is dirty. Have not used these yet.
3,Not sure,"The product came in bulk. I was expecting the Honeywell packaging, two pack. Used to come with 2 Velcro strips, the one I opened has 1. The filters seemed a bit stiffer, but I could be wrong. Hopefully, they do the same job. Shipping was good."
2,Bait and Switch,"I previously ordered these Honeywell prefilters from Amazon. Now they do not sell them anymore. They listed this item as available from several Amazon sponsored stores and I ordered it. However, even though it is listed as a Honeywell filter they sent some generic version. I have no idea how good these are and I feel misled. In fact, they cost more than I paid for the original last year direct from the Amazon store."
5,Perfect!,"It worked perfectly I'm very happy with my purchase! I have installed my new filter & feel like I'm breathing clean, fresh air once again!"
4,Great replacement pre-filter,"Some reviews complain about having to cut this to size, but for the price it is well worth the minimal effort. It took, maybe, 5 minutes to cut to size and put on the filter. It is slightly thicker than the original, but still fit into the filter base with no effort. The 2 pack means an easy replacement down the road."
3,Great deal!,"Great deal! I will have filters for a while. It is actually 2 large sheets and must be cut down to size. A little messy when I'm cutting it down to size, but still well worth it.Thanks!!"
2,Not as good as before,"I ordered these before and they were better. These are not folded as before so I think they are different. They are thinner, I have to use two layers now. If you hold them up to the light you can see through them."
2,"NOT Honeywell replacement filter -- I received a ""No-name"" filter that you have to cut to fit.","If only it was the proper size!! Way too big for my Honeywell - I did NOT get what I ordered!!! I ordered the Honeywell Replacement Pre-Filters - what I got was a huge piece of filter that I have to cut to fit...it is NOT the actual HONEYWELL replacement filters - defeats the purpose for allergy sufferers - in order to cut to the proper size you have to lay the old, dirty filter on top of the new, thick piece of garbage. This thick ""filter"" will not get rid of the allergens like Honeywell's original filter. Buyer beware!"
5,Lots of different flags!,These are really well made and the color doesn't run as they say! I didn't know there was as many flags as there are and these are a history lesson in them selves!! The price is very reasonable and it looks like it'll last for a long time!
5,Dorman Tailgate Handle 77052,"I used this Dorman handle on a 1991 Ford extended cab longbed straight side pickup and it fit perfectly. I lubricated the actuator and latch asemblies with some WD40 before operating, and it worked great."
5,Love these terminals.,"Been using these like crazy since purchase. They are under the hood, interior, trunk and show no signs of wear or deteriorating condition. That on top of the price and I'm sold on these."
2,"a ""throw-it-together-to-make-quick-cash-due-to-success-of-first-album"" album","Redman's first album was such a great recording. One of the top ten of Jazz recorded in the 90's. But this album was thrown together quickly and it sounds it. forget this CD and pick up Redman's first album. Then pick up his ""Mood Swings"" album. These two are his best."
5,"""Wish"" is a must have for any jazz collection","While in school, I listened to ""Wish"" when I was studying or reading. Redman's smooth sax helps mellow me out. Excellent CD for a candlelight dinner."
3,A tempest in a teapot.,"A classic performance, in limited but listenable sound quality. The confusion in other postings may come from differing reissues, but the Gala edition is clearly and correctly labeled. The complete performance dates from 1963 in Vienna and the role of Don Ottavio is sung by Fritz Wunderlich, with baritone Rolando Panerai singing Masetto. (Masetto is sung by baritones or basses, never by tenors.) The set ALSO includes ""bonus"" selections from a 1960 Salzburg Festival performance in which Don Ottavio is sung by Cesare Valletti. Confusingly, the ""track"" listing on Amazon lists the COMPLETE PERFORMANCE of the opera as A SINGLE TRACK (#1) and the bonus tracks as individual tracks--hence the listing of both Wunderlich and Valletti. The two beautiful voices are very distinctive, so actually listening to the recording would leave no doubt."
1,Disappointment,Disappointment is the only word for this set.Sound quality is awful even for live noname recording.
3,cool,"Angela's got a wonderful vocal range. I can see why people compare her vocal range to that of Mariah Carrey.It's a shame so many great pop cds are either overlooked or not released...hopefuly Angela will have better luck in the future.Recomended songs: Picture Perfect, Kissing You, So Fly, Stay Together, Best Friends, Wish We Could Be Free, Good Time, I Don't Care, Retrato Perfecto"
2,Needs Help,"If anyone reads this, I need help. I'm bad with writing my own summaries and I need to for my portfolio. Can anyone help?"
1,marine horn?,"The horn rusts on the inside and stains the deck. The manufacturer sent the following advise ""I would recommend you opening the Horn and clean out the collected liquid."" So after operated in a marine environment you need to open it up and dry it."
3,As Expected,"Exact replacement for the one put on my boat back in 1984. Not very loud (neither was the old one), as spec says 106dB at 3 feet. IMHO, it drops of quickly from there."
2,Boat horn,"The boat horn does not have the volume that is requires by Coast Guard regulations. If that could be improved, it would be a good product."
2,Marine Mini Compact Horn Doesn't Last Long,"I have had four of these over the last 12 years. In my experience, each has stopped working after about 3 years.It appears water gets into the horn and the corrosion kills it. I have also had spiders get into the horn, make nests, and kill the horn. Not a bad horn for the price, but it will have to be replaced frequently."
3,Works but not loud,Bought this to replace a similar AFI horn that stopped working after several years. Works but not sure it's as loud as advertised.
2,Uninspired pluss some show off!,"Compared with the Reunion Concert on One Night with Blue Note (which is great!), this was a disappointment. The group didn't sound like a team, but of different solo artist of mediocre quality. Urbaniak was also a disappointment. If you buy it, play it - and then play One Night... On that DVD Hubbard is great and the group is just fantastic!All Blues"
4,One third of Blue Amazon only....,"Blue Amazon is DJs Lee Softly and James Reid plus a vocalist who became part of the team, Vicki Webb. This disc is a Remix done by one of the djs only... The other two are absent here. It says clearly on the label. I got it anyway because ""The Javelin"" their previouse album was terrific. I was slightly dissapointed. It's does not have the beauty of ""The Javelin"", just your above average dance mix."
4,Get 'The Javelin' first!,"This CD simply isn't in the same league as the Javelin. Firstly Vicki Webb's angelic vocals are not here. Secondly, and obviously, these are not songs they compose themselves, unlike ALL the tracks on 'The Javelin', which is one of the best Trance Cds ever(they spent two years on that thing, remember it came out before alot of the stuff you here now). The sound here is still progressive, although the ambience that was so nice on ""the Javelin' is gone. The beats are faster here, but less spectacular in my opinion. 'The Javelin' sounds great on a great sound system. Also if you like 'and then the rain falls', the CD single is very good."
1,A hoax,This man is just trying to make a profit off of people gullible enough to believe this nonsense.
5,Kim Fox is amazing!,"Kim is too often overlooked as a songwriter and musician. In fact, she is completely overlooked. And it is a real shame. Her last album was great, but this album really shines! It is an amazing progression from Moon Hut. If you thought Moon Hut was too stripped down then this might be more to your liking. But at the same time, those who loved Moon Hut are sure to like this as well. Standout tracks include Baby I Want You Back, See Too Well, and Tread This World So Lightly. I'd recommend this to anyone who is enjoying the recent rash of female singer/songwriters such as Vanessa Carlton, Michelle Branch, and Norah Jones."
5,Kim Fox rox!,"I'm not usually into folksy-type music, and I'd never heard of Kim Fox, but all that changed a few weeks ago at a ""house concert"" Kim gave for around 15 people in Providence. The music was stripped down--just her and her guitar or keyboard (and she stopped even using the mic after the first song or so) but the moment she started singing, the hairs on the back on my neck stood on end. Wow. And it didn't hurt that she's really, really cool, sweet and down to earth.This CD is a bit eclectic--a mix of upbeat pop and quieter, thoughtful introspection. ""I've Got Music"" has the potential to be a top-40 hit (but not in that bad, cheesy way). Follow this grrls' career. Once she gets her super-duper big break, she'll be off like a rocket. Check out kim@kim-fox.com."
2,A Completely Misleading Title,"After reading 65% of this book, I put it down because it was not the book that the title had led me to expect, nor was it a book that I wanted to read. It is a multi-generational history of a particular family and their involvement in Palestinian terrorism. Munich is NOT the central focus of this book."
3,very similar,like other books on the munich massacre this is strikingly similar to those. it was disappointing when i ordered this book with another on the even for an international relations research paper only to find that the books were almost duplicates with minor variations. if you have one book on the massacre then you have them all
3,Good mixer,The mixer is very handy. It's great the way the mixer can be removed from the stand. It also works well as a stand mixer and can work on it's own unattended.The switches could have been located closer together but that's not a big problem.The quality is only fair but there are not a lot of stand mixers on the market that can also be used as hand mixers.
1,"Lasted 3 months, junk","The title says it all, mixer motor broke after 3 months, just outside of return period."
1,Ripoff,This is a poor excuse for a training manual. Way over priced.This book should sell for $3.95 if that much. You definitely can't learn about mortgage business from this book. Threw it in the trashcan after reading about 15 pages. It only took 3 mins. to read that much.
4,Won't Disappoint A Real Critic of Downbeat,"I have to say the track ""Window Pain"" by Nudge will make a downbeat classic. Grand Central releases are always on the funky and soulful side, with heavy bass-riffs and a touch of hip-hop. If you are a Nu Jazz and hip-hop fan, this one will go down like hot soup on a wintry day.I'm also writing this review after having loop-listened to this album for 3 months. It's actually quite fresh, which is why I gave it 4 stars. Descriptively, the novelty effect for me isn't there anymore, so I am unable to harp a thumbs-up with a passion. However, this compilation is not something that will disappoint a real critic of the downbeat/nu jazz genre."
4,A gentle read,"Quiet, comforting, filled with life's lessons. Learn to forgive and accept yourself as you are and believe in your value. These aren't easy lessons, or we learn them for a day or two, then need to be reminded. We are reminded to forgive and accept others, also.Many good lessons in a small volume."
5,Funny and uplifting,"When my sister passed this book on to me I thought I'd never read it. Like I want to read about someone's father dying of lung cancer? It turns out I read The Stuff of Life in about two sittings. This compulsively readable memoir is funny and wise and has a lot to say about how important it is to just be yourself, and do what you can for the people you love. It debunks the myth that in order to be a caregiver you have to have a Florence Nightengale-type personality. It's NOT about death, but about how we live. It's about the mess of life. I thought it was way better than Tuesdays with Morrie, because it was more real."
4,I work for a hospice,"I work for a hospice and this book was quite informative in many ways. Including: father/daughter relationships, lung CA, explanation on how it can effect someone and taking care of a loved one at home. I was surprised by something that is disclosed in the book) and taken slightly aback but I was motivated to read more!"
4,Wonderful Writing,"Very good heartwarming book. Really enjoyed the characters, and the writers perception of events."
2,Top rated...but dissappointed,I bought this product 1 yr ago after reading reviews on amazon.com. We have used it for 1 yr on an electric range with a bridge burner. After 1 yr it is warped and does not sit flat on the stove top. This causes hot and cold areas and make it worthless for cooking. I am planning on looking at an electric frying pan instead.
5,Very good griddle ....,This is a great griddle. We use it on our ceramic top stove and place it over two burners. It stays flat and makes great french toast on Sunday mornings!!
5,Kitchen Aid Griddle Pan,"Pan works great, used it over two gas burners ,made french toast & pancakes. Very easy to clean nothing sticks to pan."
1,Wobbles badly,"I bought this item for one purpose only. I need to ream very close tolerance holes in aircraft frames working in a difficult access area. When I put a reamer in this product I discovered that there was at least a 1/8 inch wobble. I removed the chuck to see if that was the problem. It wasn't, it's the 90 degree portion of the tool. When I reinstalled the chuck, you could feel the wobble in the poorly cut threads. If you are building a tree house or drilling drywall, this product would be fine. If you are doing work that demands precision, avoid this tool like it's a flesh eating zombie."
1,Don't buy it if you bought the guard,"I bought the Biesemeyer Overhead Guard kit for my Delta Unisaw.Both on Amazon and Biesemeyer's site they recommend the 78-966 kit if you buy the overhead guard. So of course I bought it.$99 - and you get a hose and two plastic guards - supposedly to replace standard ones on the overhead guard. However the Guard now already has those pieces on it - so basically you are paying $99 for a length of hose.I sent an email to Biesemeyer to complain, but never got a response."
2,typical harlequin,We didn't really get into Rhys' mind so everything was from Alix view point. Seemed to drag on a long time. Finally it picked up when she came to that realization that ah-ha moment. But then it just made you angry once again because for some reason all the hero in these books has to do is kiss the heroine and she no longer has a backbone. And you thought that she did from the ah-ha moment until the kiss! Wasn't really there before that. Also why is it that if the heroine acts out in any way the hero always calls her childish?
3,A good album,"Back when I first obtained this disc many years ago, I was impressed with how different it was. I still enjoy listening to it even now. The Stone exhibits solid compositions and sounds to me like a combination of New Age and synth-pop. Also, The Stone is Babble's first full-length piece of work, released in 1994. Babble consists of Tom Bailey and Alannah Currie (ex-Thompson Twins). Ten tracks are contained. The album's sound quality is nice, too. Both Bailey and Currie provide vocals. My favorite pieces are ""You Kill Me,"" ""Beautiful,"" and ""Space."" Bailey sings nicely on the chorus of the laid-back ""You Kill Me."" I like the mellow ""Beautiful"" because of its pleasing melodies. The tremulous, gratifying keyboard melody and the tight bass line of ""Space"" help make it memorable. The disc is just over 51 minutes. The Stone is recommendable."
2,Obscure but good,"This is a great cd to throw on sometimes..... took me forever to find it. While ""Beautiful"" is a classic, not much on this album serves for multiple listens. ""Ether"" is much better. But if you find this is as cheap as I did, its worth buying just for ""beautiful"" and ""Sunray Dub""."
2,fram ca9875 Air Filter,"I bought this for a Saturn 2006 Ion 2, and for some reason it had pointed rubber corners unlike the picture and the filter I replaced. It would not fit properly, so I rounded off the corners with scissors and installed it, but I wouldn't buy it online again."
4,P.O.D. LUNCHBOX,"P.O.D. cartoon logo lunchbox. This is my favorite logo that P.O.D. has ever put out. To have it on my lunchbox is really fun to see when I'm grubing at work. I wish it was a little bigger, but still really cool. If you can get it at a decent price ($12 or less) it's totally worth it to support this awesome Godly band!"
2,Too tight!,"Seller shipped promptly and order arrived soon enough, but the balaclava was listed as one-size-fits-all, and that isn't even close to true. I have a normal sized head, not especially large or small, but the balaclava is painfully tight even on me. Seems to be sized for a child of 12 or so, not an adult."
5,Love the small font/book size of this 6th edition,"I absolutely love this edition's small size, resulted mainly from using a smaller font by the printer, in sharp contrast to many other bloated door stoppers. The excellent, solid, and comprehensive tutorial/reference materials are jampacked into about 700 pages. Definitely looking forward to a similarly printed Volume 2, which is currently in its 5th printed in a larger font--thus significantly thicker and heavier. After some extensive browsing, sampling, and committing time seriously going through a number of Java books, I concluded that ""Core Java 2"" (both volumes together) is the best on the subject."
3,Not exactly a Kathy Sierra Book,"I thought about giving a 2 star rating, but I'll give it 3 stars for complete coverage of the Tiger 5.0 stuff. For a 7th Edition this author is still very choppy, blunt and fast paced. Code annotation is disappointing especially after reading Kathy Sierra's Sun Certified or Head First Books. Cay Horstman doesn't seem to care if he leaves some readers behind, he plows forward leaving out too many details. He offers some but not enough explaination between the lines. Not enough favors are given to the reader, its almost as he assumes that ""you got it"" so he won't spare any effort to stop and break down with gentle details. To be fair, the editing was very well and he obviously knows Java. But Too many damn C++ tidbit comparisons. If you are an experienced programmer then this book is targeted for you. It is technically rich and to the point (for wizards and gurus) and not enough kid gloves treatment for the regular mortal."
3,Why is the Kindle version so expensive?,"I have an earlier version of this book and would love to get a Kindle version for reference. But... You save $3 by getting the digital version despite the fact that there is no shipping, storage, or printing costs?WTF?At $10 a piece I'd love to fill a Kindle with dozens of coding reference books that are filling up my library, but at $30+ a piece it's just not worth it."
3,"Good language introduction, uneven after that","The first section of this book, which explores the Java language and object orientation in depth is excellent. After that the book goes into Swing, applets (is anyone doing them anymore?), and then into debugging and file I/O. Funny, I would have thought that both of the final chapters would have been pushed forward. Certainly file I/O should go before Swing, right?Frankly, I think too much time was spent on Swing. The book turned into a reasonably in-depth introduction to Swing and event oriented programming. When it probably should have gone into threading, regular expressions, file I/O and other fundamentals. The quality of the language discussion saved this book for me."
5,Great book for basics of Java,"Be aware, this is not a step-by-step kind of introduction book.This is more designed towards programmers with experience(could be coming from C++, Smalltalk, C etc).Gives a clean perspective on the basics of the language. Distinguishes Java from other OO programming languages with respect to inheritance etc.This book has helped many great developers to get good at the fundamentals of the language. It is a good stepping stone to move into bigger aspects. Has elaborate intros and examples on Swing aswell.Highly recommended for starters on the language. A reference that you can keep at your desk."
2,You'd be better off with Google,"I have read a lot of technical books in my day, and I am flat out tired of the poorly organized books authored by proficient techies who can not organize topics or write. Core Java falls into this category. The book is bloated and disproporionate.Why is 2/7 of the book spent on GUI-related concepts at the expense of fundamentals? Why is reflection covered along with inheritance? Why do examples contain anonymous inner classes (which the author admits are bad)? Why do the examples consistently use concepts that are covered chapters later? The answer is because the book is poorly written and organized.Save your money and use the Internet to learn Java. It's free, and it's better.I get the feeling that those who favorably review this book are defending Java more than the book. This is not a debate over the technology. It is simply a review of a book intended to teach technology. The book is bad. Java might be, too, but that is another topic altogether."
5,A necessary text for those involved in this field,"This is a top of the line book and is a must have. It is also invaluable as a reference tool for research and writing. I would not suggest this book if you are not involved in law enforcement or psychology; it is primarily useful for people in the field, not those who enjoy ""true crime"" books."
5,The best teaching book for investigators,I am a legal asst. and read this book as part of an investigation course and my internship. I found it to be extremly informative and helpful. I recommend this book to anyone that is in the legal or investigative fields.
5,"Very thorough, detailed explanations and instructions","This was our text book in a graduate school class on Investigating Violent Crime. This book takes students on a step by step approach to investigating violent crime from the moment the incident is called in to the police until the case is cleared. It is so thorough, I can't imagine anything having been left out. This is one of the few text books I won't be putting away in the basement, but will keep it on my book shelf for ready reference. Easy to read and follow. Lots of photos (some of which I could have done without, but if we are going to investigate homicides, I suppose we have to be prepared to see stuff like this)."
5,"Excellent; thorough, in-depth, and professional","I am a writer of police thrillers and had this book recommended to me by a homicide detective. It certainly filled in all kinds of holes in my research, though it is not for the faint of heart. An excellent overview of how a homicide investigation should be conducted."
5,Forensic Science Student -AIAS,"This book is a must have for anyone involved in law enforcement, forensics, or someone who might just be curious about the detailed workings of homicide investigation.Some of the pictures are gruesome but reveal an actual crime scene that you can learn from. All pictures have explanations beneath them to give the reader an explanation of what they are seeing.There's plenty of references and checklists for those involved in this field to make good use of.This book is fantastic! I've actually read it from cover to cover. Vernon really knows his stuff and obviously done his homework."
2,Disappointing,"The garments are gorgeous. However, the book is written primarily for a machine that is no longer available, made by Brother. Other machines can be substituted if the correct gauge, but all measurements are in metric which can be a challenge in the US. Also, since the book is written in the UK, and I have never seen the yarns described widely available in the US I think you would have to be very advanced to do all the substitutions, and if you were that advanced you probably wouldn't need this book."
2,Not thrilled,"We bought this dresser for our second baby, so we were very dissapointed when it did not turn out to be as good quality as the one we picked for our first child. One of the glides for the top drawer was missing a component so the top drawer does not slide in straight and looks lopsided. I need to call the company about replacing that part, but haven't had a chance as who has time for these things with a young baby.... I also thought I could use the top of the dresser as a changing table as we had done with our first baby's dresser, and I was dismayed to find out that the top surface is slightly smaller (by a few inches) than the standard changing station surface so the changing mat that we had previously does not fit. Not very happy with this product, it doesn't feel like a solid qulity piece of furniture and doesn't look/act like it either!"
2,Poor quality for price,I expected a little better quality for the price. The wood on the drawers split when screws were put into it. There were several missing screws. I am very disappointed and would not recommend this dresser.
1,Keep shipping the wrong item,I don't even know how the quality of this products stacks up because I ordered the espresso to match my crib and they shipped the black. I didn't realize until I took out one piece (which was about the correct color) then something told me to take out another and it was black. I returned it for a replacement and got the same thing. I looked at my orders on Amazon and the main order shows Espresso but when I click on the actual item it shows black. Something is wrong with the Amazon.com systems and it is preventing me from getting the product that I want so off to Sears I go... :-(
3,O'k for the price,"I really liked the look of this dresser for my daughter's new room. The dresser looks pretty good now that it's together but it was difficult to put together. There was also a piece that wasn't painted black because it is on the inside, but you can see the bare wood through the drawer. The drawers aren't as deep as the drawer front and they don't open and close smoothly. All in all I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Pretty but Cheap,"My husband is incredibly adept at putting the hardest stuff together, and while it only took him 2 hours to build this dresser, there are a million teeny, tiny parts to use. I would not suggest this item to anyone who sucks at putting together things, like I am.It's a really pretty dresser/change station, and matches our crib but the drawers are not solid wood, they are made of flimsy particle board. Boo on that. The wood itself is also pretty chip as there are dings and scratches in it just from shipping.I wouldn't have been disappointed looking at and maybe buying something else. There was one piece that was broken so we have to call and get that replaced. The changing table part doesn't fit a standard changing pad so that kind of sucks too.PROS- It looks prettyCONS- Cheap material, broken parts, hard to put together, changing table top is small.I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
3,"Attractive dresser, mediocre quality","I bought this to use as both a dresser & a changing table. I loved the look & functionality of the product. However, I was hoping for better quality for the price I paid. Although I believe the exterior portions are solid wood, the drawer bottoms are that thin plywood that slides into a narrow groove. Any weight in the drawer over time will cause the bottoms to bend & warp & come out of the groove. I also had a hard time getting the sides to latch tight enough using the hardware provided to keep the drawers from falling out of the drawer slides (glides).Also, if you're going to use it as a changing table, make sure you purchase a 30"" changing pad, not the standard 32"", as the dresser top will only accommodate the smaller size.All in all, the product is providing us with what we needed - a changing table & dresser. I just don't have confidence that it will last throughout our son's childhood as we had hoped it would."
3,"Okay for the money, but had to exchange a drawer.","Nice dresser for baby's nursery, but a drawer was off line & wouldn't close right. Seller had to ship another dresser (for us to get the drawer), and we had the hassle of return shipping the second dresser. After installing the second drawer, it works fine. For the money, it is a nice dresser for the nursery."
5,Very pleased with product,Book was shipped and received promptly. Great seller.The Big Book of Dinosaurs (Big Books)
2,Disappointed,"Disappointed with the length; this is a tall but thin book. Based on research, I thought this would be different than the many other dinosaur books my 4-yr. old has, but same information presented in a slightly different manner. Child was visibly disappointed on Christmas but sweetly said: ""Mommy I love it"" even though scarce information was new. I will go to Borders where I can sit and look through the offerings before I buy a replacement. For someone with a dino-crazy child who memorizes odd and obscure facts about each type of creature from each age (which describes a lot of 4-yr. olds) this is not the book. It's perhaps a good starter - albeit slim - book, as the pictures are quite good and some of the dinos are not your run of the mill names. If you have a dino-nut on your hands, look for something with more heft."
5,Great Value,This is a nice book. I purchased this book for my 3 year old so I could read it to him and he could enjoy the illustrations. This book will be great for both. The pictures will be more interesting to him at this point than what I'm reading but he loves a good night night story and this will give me something to read to him rather than the same little story over and over again. The illustrations on the cover are a very good representation of what you will find throughout the book but there's a lot of good information in the book as well. It's a big sturdy book so all in all I think it's worth every penny.
4,very old from 1994,"My son who is three and loves dinosaurs, loves this book. Many of the dinos that are common are in this book. It has great pictures and some good info. I should have looked at the publication date because many dinos like the spinosoaurus who is the largest dino, is not in this book. I assume because the book is so old. Many discoveries have happened in 16 years. Overall it is a good reading but if your kids loves spinosoraus, don't bother with it."
3,Dinosaurs,"Nicely illustrated but short for the price. It's 32 pages, not all of which are dinosaur pictures. Still, the publisher did a nice job!"
3,Needing update on historical perspective,"Schweich lectures are thoroughly researched; nonetheless, exists a demand for update on this 1988 historical perspective. References to Ethiopia in the Bible point to ""Nubia""(South of Egypt)in modern Sudan; however,not modern Ethiopia. This mistaken terminology has been revised in the mainstream of Biblical history. I suggest that anyone using Schweich's ""Ethiopia and the Bible"" as a study guide, should keep this important point in mind."
5,The best shaving gel,"I was given my first bottle of Razor Sharp by my son some years ago and continued to buy it until it was no longer available in the UK. Having tried other products I was pleased to find that I could obtain it once more, via a friend, from the US. This really is the best shaving product I have used. Some people regard it as expensive but I doubt that it is, on a cost per shave basis, because I find that not only does one bottle last for months, the blades of my razor last longer. I would recommend it to anyone. The Common Man runs it a close second."
5,Great Service,"I just received this product by UPS on Friday, like a kid with a new toy, I went to the shop to put it on my old Craftsman. It was packed with a defective part... by this time it was 11:00 P.M., I called the factory on Saturday, a little after noon and found someone there. The gentleman was very helpful and told me he would priority mail the replacement part as soon as the post office opened on Monday. If the fence system is as good as the service I've received, then this is a great product. Thank you VEGA."
4,"Positive lock; assembly instructions, hmmmm...","Once installed, the performance of this fence is outstanding. Ittook me about two hours to install on a 1950s Craftsman 8-inchsaw (had to do some grinding on the interior skirting of the fence walls to clear the star washers and nuts.) I would recommend this item highly--when you lock the main cam, the fencedoes NOT move at all. The instructions could be quite a bit better. My advice would be to lay all the parts out next to the saw and read the instructions MANY times before starting assembly."
4,Vega Fence,"The fence is what has been needed in my shop for years. After not being able to get one @ Sears I shopped online to find the Vega. Setup and installation was easy. Accuracy is excellant. Overall I am well pleased with the fence.Cons- The 2 holes that had to be drilled in the rear support should be done @ the factory. Almost every review I read the fence had been purchased for a sears 10"". It seems holes should be present for that saw at least. I do not like the way the back of the fence is allowed to run wild. Other fences have a far superior hold down for the rear. This could be partially solved by predrilling the holes in the rear support."
4,Vega saw fence,"The Vega fence arrived in a timely fashion-had some chips of paint missing from the slide ,but works very well. The measuring scale is off and the slide bar is a lack luster color--a walnut wood grain with vega spelled out in red.But does make cutting a pleasure."
4,Vega U26 fence,"I like the fence and it will run circles around the fence that came with my saw. The engineering on this fence was great but the reason I gave it a four was the workmanship. If I were making the fence the castings would be slightly larger than needed so when they were milled they would clean up completely and all machined parts would be deburred. I would expect this kind of workmanship from China but not from Canada or the US. After that, I would lower the price so everyone could afford it and want one or saw manufacturers would contract with me to supply fences for all of their table saws."
3,"Works fine, but.........","This fence is very fairly priced, and does what it's supposed to do quite well, but mine has a flaw that may or may not be present in others. When the fence is locked down, the far end moves very slightly towards the blade thus skewing its placement. The movement is perhaps 1/32nd of an inch at the most, so it may be un-noticeable for many folks. I have the fence adjusted so it's parallel to the blade when locked, so that isn't a problem. Anyway, I use it, I like it, but it's not perfect."
5,"Good product, fast shipping","This fence is significantly better than the original fence that came with my vintage Delta table saw.Better = sturdy + precise + straight + squareAlthough the original fence had obviously seen a lot of use when I purchased the saw, the U26 has some very nice features that were not part of the original fence.One feature that I was not aware of from other reviews was that the fence is a bracket that holds the back end of the fence down. I originally thought that it was only held down at the front end. This feature enables me to use feather boards and fixtures that will hold wood against the table surface."
4,Saw fence,I bought this for 20+ year old Tiwanese table saw. The Vega fence is acurate and versital. Because of this fence I won't be buying a new table saw in the near future.
4,Vega Saw,"This is a great fence. I had two problems with it. One the knob was broken on the fine adjustment lever. Two the screw was stripped out on the adjustment site. I sent an email to Vega to get it fixed but never heard from them. The fence installed easily on my old craftsman 10"" saw. I only had to drill one hole."
2,A Bit Boring,"While Larry Long's heart is in the right place, and his songs show compassion and tolerance, I'm afraid that the CD is not very interesting. Unlike other folk singers who can meld the political and the lyrical or whose passion carries the music, this sort of drifts by and I have had no desire to re-play the CD."
4,Cheap Trick scores big,"I've enjoyed Cheap Trick's work for a long time, yet I've always been puzzled by their level of 'success', since I consider them one of the Best artists of the '70's, the '80's, and the '90's. I'd have anticipated them becoming much bigger and more renowned since they have made plenty of great albums and songs( including 'Standing On the Edge' with George Martin, who I wish had done more work after that album.) They've done several albums from the '90's into this decade and Woke Up With a Monster is one of my favorites, one of the top 3, in my opinion. Although they don't appear to get much airplay, they are outstanding compared to anyone or anything."
4,Keep On Going,"This Cheap Trick cd is amazing. I remember first seeing the She's Tight video on MTV, and was also amazed by Rick Neilsen's five guitars stuck together. That image is still with me today as my love for their great music keeps on going. For a band that started in 77 they have some of the best cd's I ever heard and Woke Up With A Monster does it again. All the songs are really good. If your a big fan of Cheap Trick like me your difently want to check out this cd. Just for the fact alone it's Cheap Trick. For all you die hard fans you can also check out a cameo by Rick Nielsen in a movie called Disordelies, where Rick Neilsen gets pulled over by the Fat Boys. Check out this cd and you diffently won't be disapointed."
2,"Loud, noisy and poorly produced","I have changed my opinion a bit about this album, because it's actually not a nightmare. I totally agree `tho with Mike Acquisto about the technical criticism, and I think the album have more than a touch of a frantic feeling. ""Woke up with a monster"" sounds loud and noisy for some reason but I guess that's the way producer Templeman wanted it. Underneath the surface, there are in fact some really good songs buried, but since they chose to go at full speed from the beginning there's no way to put in overdrive when it comes to the choruses, and I guess this doesn't benefit the songs at all. Among the better tunes are the opening rocker ""My gang"" and the melody driven ""Didn't know I had it"". Some might consider Cheap trick being the American answer to Slade, both regarding the musical direction as well as the humorous side, but if you gotta chose - go for Slade!"
5,BEST TRICK ALBUM EVER,"I'll keep this short and to the point. This is by far the BEST Cheap Trick album ever recorded. 11 great tracks including their greatest song ever (in my opinion, see if you agree) Tell Me Everything. You will want to listen to it over and over again."
4,good stuff,"This product is easy to mix and use. Convenient to keep on hand.stores well--longer than recommended if kept in cool, dry place (such as the basement). Though with drinking it does taste better after a few hours of refrigeration, it can be used immediately with good flavor. For cooking, it can't be detected as different from whole milk. I first began using it to help a limited budget, but several months later when I could afford whole milk again my kids decided they liked the Mix n Drink milk better."
3,OK,This milk is OK. It is not really for drinking and more for cooking. In my opinion it has more of the flat aftertaste that powdered milk can have. Wal-mart Great Value is slightly better with Provident Pantry having the best taste.
3,12 cents a Quart price increase over night,"This product was .78 cents a quart one day, which made it about .02 cents cheaper per quart than the local supermarket. Now it's jumped to .90 cents per quart making it .10 cents more expensive per quart than the local supermarket. I gave it 3 stars because of the massive jump in price but the quality of the product itself gets 4.5 stars."
1,SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GIVE GOOD REVIEWS - NO LONGER,I AM LOWERING THIS REVIEW SINCE THEIR HUGH 25% JACK UP IN PRICE. $1.25 A QUART IS WAY TO HIGH TO BUY ANYMORE.I am pretty much disabled and hate it when I run out of milk. I'm buying this so I have reserve on hand when it's to hard to go to the store when I run out of milk. The 12 3qt bags is a little more expensive but I figure it will stay fresher longer and I will probably only need one bag a month or so. I have heard Saco is a good brand. I will add to this review after I have tried it.--Update: IT WAS GOOD AT $36 A CASE BUT NOW IS A RIP-OFF AT $44. THE 40 QT BOX ALSO JUMPED TO $44 PLUS $13 STINKING SHIPPING. NOW YOU HAVE A HUGE HIGH PRICE. IT'S NOW WORTH BUYING THIS CRAP ANYMORE.
4,Excellent Overview,This book provides an excellent overview of the techniques and equipment involved in analytical chemistry. The descriptions and explanations are useful and concise. The abundant diagrams help clarify complex ideas.
2,So-So Book,"Sandy Dennis was an awesome actress. As this book proves, she was also a good writer. However, if you are wanting to know more about her career, you will learn almost nothing from reading this book.Personally, I didn't enjoy this book, at all. It's like reading a book of short stories which is not what I was looking for.You may feel differently. I wanted more of a standard autobiography which this book definitely is not."
3,Bill HIcks - Salvation @ Oxford,Wasn't as humorous as I'd hoped from previews. But the Bush jokes are still relevant and my British In-Laws loved the hometown references.
4,"Started with ""Aion"" and ""Into the Labyrinth"" so this is probably not the definitive work for me...","I love ""Dead Can Dance"" any way you slice it. They really gave birth to the world-beat fusion music from which Enigma and Cocteau Twins sprang. My introduction to the group was at a later stage in their development. ""Labyrinth"" for me was the definitive CD. Would probably have said something different if I had heard this CD first."
2,Warning! Danger Dr. Smith!!,"I believe this is an CD for musicologists or DCD groupies. If you were drawn to the group by their supernal, medieval/renaissance music in Aion, Serpent's Egg, etc., don't buy this CD (despite the cool, funky graphic). A specialist would be able to write a fascinating article on the evolution of DCD, but the DCD fan of its other music would be better off putting his/her money on, say, Lisa Gerrard's THE MIRROR POOL. So, WARNING, DANGER DR. SMITH! PUT YOUR MONEY BACK IN YOUR POCKET!!"
2,Not very good . . .,"This should not even be called DCD because it is so unlike their later work. The songs are horribly produced and center around dreary, guitar based drones with wafer thin bass/drum machine."
3,Good album.,I give it three stars only because it is a tad dark for my tastes anymore. The barley song is specifically why I bought this album. Love that tune.
5,"despite the pinkness, a solid set of tools","i bought these for my wife, despite my apprehension based on reviews of the quality of tools made for the ""pink, therefore cute, therefore not for actual use"" crowd. despite that, these have proven to be made for functional use. i have used them several times myself. i, a MAN, have used pink tools (ROFL)"
2,Incredibly Weak,"Well, the only purpose I bought this was for my Ash costume [of The Evil Dead series] for Halloween. When I took it out of the box, I was surprised to see it was a working BB gun shotgun, one that I'm not allowed to have on campus.So I guess I'm lucky in this case that the damn thing broke an hour out of the box. Guess the only thing I'm getting out of this is for display purposes.You get what you pay for I guess. Just wish the shipping wasn't as much as the gun."
4,Great dance CD,"The extended version of the rare Madonna single Sidewalk Talk alone makes this worth the purchase. Plus, you get extended versions of club classics like ""What Is Love"" by Hathaway you can't find anywhere else. Definitely for lovers of club music!"
3,Good Product with extremely slow shipping,An excellent tool table for any 'bench-top' tool. But it took ten days to ship and five to be delivered. Your local Sears store is a far better source for this type tool.
4,Super Reader,"Jerry Cornelius may be one of the wackiest and wildest superhero adventurer types ever created. Deliberately created by Moorcock to be the ultimate chameleon, which has seen him featured in many places and times. This leads to people looking for people with similar names in famous events in history.In the Final Programme he is a swinging super-agent with a needle gun.His family is no less whacky, given his sister is sometimes his lover, and his brother sometimes his target.A hero like this must have similarly bizarre antagonists, enemies, and allies.He certainly does, and Una Persson, a female version of himself, to some degree, is also one of his sister's lovers.Basically, Jerry stuff is a little hard to explain."
4,Saddle,"This saddle is great! I have used it previously for numerous century rides, as well as leisurely touring."
5,Dolly wears the coat of many colors,"A very talented singer who has been in the music business for many years is comming in concert on my anniversary October 20, 2008. Still deciding if I will be able to attend without my husband, this is a far dream to see Dolly perform quite a few of my favorites including Coat Of Many Colors. I remember as a young girl listening to this song in the car and knew every word. I saw her perform when I was a young girl but that was many years back. A few other favorites are : Potential New Boyfriend, Two Doors Down, Here You Come Again, I Will Always Love You, Islands In The Stream and many more. Tampa will welcome you to see Dolly in concert At the Ruth Eckerd Hall, starts @ 8pm. I wish my dad could go with me. I dedicate I Will Always Love You to a friend for life. I knew at 16 and really from that moment he would be in my life . You will always be in my heart, and I will never let you go. Just When I Needed You Most. love always."
2,what I thought of the cd,"The best song in the album was the title ""Coat of Many Colors"" Other than that selection there wasn't much more of enjoy ment there."
4,Album better than the bonuses.,"This is one of three titles re-issued of Dolly Parton. This one, along with ""Jolene"" have been issued on CD several times already. So the draw here are the bonus tracks. In this case the album as a whole is better than the bonus tracks. The bonus tracks are good, but nothing that stands out and knocks you over. The acoustic ""My Blue Tears"" is the best of the bunch though. As for the original album, some classic tracks here. One Dolly's stronger early albums."
3,ok,"Not a freat recording, but it does contain some pieces otherwise hard to get so it was worth the purchase."
2,wrong item,"this item was supposed to be IN CHANNEL for sportage 2009 but was for 2003-2006 stick on... it fit close enough to use without hassle of returning, but the cost difference wasa loss to me.....was not even putco brand and was made in south korea and would never order anything from putco again."
2,this sucks,when i got my trumpet i was expecting something good not a dented trumpet defiantly wont buy from this seller again
4,An album more than a retrospective,"I bought this CD wincing, knowing I was buying some slop with the treats. But on first listen that wince became the smile I had upon first hearing Lou years ago. The problem some reviewers have with this disc is that it's not ""objective"" enough - doesn't include all the agreed-upon classics - and therefore is merely an excuse for Lou to hoist upon us his personal favorites. What's really going on is this: Lou used tracks from his entire career to make not a retrospective but an album, with the feel and logic of an album; not every track is a stand-out, but every track fills a role in setting the scene and telling the story. Even with its flaws, this may be one of the best Lou Reed albums, from that point of view. Point-of-view is what makes this a coherent work, not merely a collection of career highs."
4,Evil never sounded so good...,"Haunting and deliciously intimate, Thrill Me perfectly showcases the potential of the chamber musical. With a cast of two and a piano, Dolginoff crafts an utterly compelling - and frightening - theatre experience that transcends its provocative subject matter. We are completely bound to Nathan Leopold's journey from start to finish. We understand his attraction to, and motivations for wanting to please Richard Loeb. It's uncomfortable, but that's part of the appeal. This isn't one for the Times Square tourist crowd.The lyrics are a touch clunky and simplistic (as are some moments of the book) and grate against the fluid beauty of the score, but they detract little from the overall effect. And I defy anyone not to be utterly disturbed by 'Roadster.'"
2,Rubbermaid's are better,"While they appear as advertised, the tops and the way they attach to the shakers is pretty flimsy. The Rubbermaid ones I bought 4-5 years ago are much sturdier - I still have them, and doubt these Tupperware ones will last as long. (the tops, that is)"
5,WHOA,"This CD is cold, a must have. The best track is #7 Life Without Pain, he ripped it. There is no way you can not like this CD the beats, rhyming, everything is on point. Certified Trunk Beater."
1,Don't waste your money,"I had enjoyed Evanovich's Plum series, but this book is a waste of shelf space."
3,SEASONAL LACKLUSTER FLUFF.........,"When Megan Murphy finds someone's big pet rabbit eating a whole in her skirt, she sets off in search of the owner; soon she discovers that the owner is the new pediatrician in town, Dr. Patrick Hunter. Sparks fly, a baby is abandoned, and soon the two find themselves playing house with Thanksgiving on the horizon. A surprise visit from Megan's parents coupled with Patrick's family and his planned Thanksgiving meal, and soon both sets of parents have the couple mentally wed. But both are in denial...after all, Megan was recently left at the altar. And Pat, with all of his school loans and patient commitments is hardly in a position to take on a wife...or is he?Patently cliche with none of the hallmark Plum fun or wit, it's an okay read if you are searching for something seasonal to read at Thanksgiving...which I was. But if you're looking for a fab storyline and great character development....keep looking.DYB"
3,a disappointment,"This is not what one would expect from Janet. Very dull. The characters were super basic. Overall it was an easy read, but left one wanting a little more..."
2,No Thanksgiving,"After having read a few of the Stephanie Plum series, which are witty, fun, and just plain great reading, I was soooo disappointed in Thanksgiving. The writing was so different, not nearly as good as the S.P. series, that I had a hard time believing it was written by the same person. My advice to others, stick to Stephanie Plum!"
1,Thanksgiving,"It seems this book is written for 14 year old readers. I confess I did not finish the book after page 70 or so because it has just too silly a plot, has totally inane characters and contrives to be funny on a predicitible and absurdly simple-minded level. I am sorry this kind of book is such a best seller."
3,Early Evanovich is just okay,"This is one of the earlier novels by the famed author of the Stephanie Plum Numbers series. He early works are comedy romances if you will. Not steamy but kooky instead. She has come a long way as an author since these early works. While it is somewhat fun, it's by no means a must read. This story centers around Megan and a pediatrician named Pat. One of Pat's patient's drops her baby off with them, mistaking them as a married couple, and runs off to take care of some business for a few weeks. The story takes place around Thanksgiving and ends right around Christmas. A fun, quick and easy read but it's mostly fluff - not a lot of substance."
3,Light and Easy,"I was not expecting ""Thanksgiving"" to be as entertaining as the Stephanie Plum series and I was right BUT I still enjoyed this book. If you are looking for a deep romance, step away from this one. If you want an easy read that is mildly entertaining then go for it. I always enjoy Janet's work even if it's not her ""best."""
1,Zzzzzzzzzzz,"I'm a big Janet Evanovich fan in general, but man oh man is this ever a dull book. It's virtually plot-free and has no supporting characters deeper than a wading pool. This is a very, very boring book that makes you long forMy other complaint was a personal one - I just couldn't warm up to the main character, who just seemed totally irrational. In fact, the whole 'plot' made little sense to me - what 30-year old adults torture themselves endlessly about whether or not they can stomach getting married after knowing someone less than a month? Suffice it to say that I was unable to suspend my disbelief.If you're looking for a non-Stephanie Plum Janet Evanovich book, try that Alex Barnaby series or the ""Full"" series set in SC. Believe me, you'll thank me later."
1,Shake off the Dust,"This book is a reprint of an older romance novel this author wrote when writing in that style. It is dated and out of character with the authors current books. I know I should have rersearched a bit before assuming that this may be a new mystery novel by this author but, knowing nothing about her previous writing experiences, didn't think it needed to be researched. Re-releasing old material is a cheap shot. I expected better."
3,Thanksgiving,"I been so busy with THANKSGIVING"" I haven't had time to read it. But just looking at the begining and the back cover-it's got to be good. It's JANET EVANOVICH!"
1,Ick.,"I'm listening to the book on CD, and I don't think I'll be able to get through it. It is so sickeningly sweet it is making my teeth rot. The romance it totally forced and contrived - throw two people into a story and make them love each other for no reason. The plot is ridiculous and stupid. I've gotten as far as - girl loves/hates boy, boy loves girl, boy and girl get a baby shoved into their laps and decide to 'play house,' boy and girl are planning to cook Thanksgiving dinner. What is this dreck?"
4,another quirky romance,"A little to quick of a read like her other romance novels, though I can appreciate that it would have been more average in length if her love stories were erotica instead of her fade-to-black style"
3,Cute,No it may not be the Plums but it is still a cute story and a quick read. Great stocking stuffer!!!
2,Unrealistic,"I read chick lit, but this is not for me! It's a romance, but it seems like only a 13 year old girl would enjoy the story."
4,A fun easy read,"Megan is a woman who has been engaged 3 times. She has moved to Colonial Williamsburg to start over and give up men. Then one day while sitting on a bench a bunny starts eating her skirt. The bunny's owner is the new pediatrician in town, Patrick.Soon they find themselves playing house and hosting a Thanksgiving dinner for both their families.This is a cute story about two people who think they are not ready for love. Janet adds her usual flair with some zany happenings. There is witty and funny banter between characters. And of course an undesciplined animal, this time in the form of a bunny.Not the deepest of romances, but enjoyable all the same."
4,Still like it,"While this is a reprint of an older story of Evanovich it still holds together nicely. A fun, light heart read that is timeless. It's setting in Williamsburg helps a lot. Bunnies, babies, a fun guy and a soft heart gal what's not to like. Read it when it was first printed and the reprint was just a good. Buy it. I did twice."
2,"Meh,","I picked up Thanksgiving hoping for a cute fun read for the holidays. Instead I found the plot of this novel rather thin and the humor a bit 'meh.' From the moment where the rabbit was eating our heroine's costume to the scene where the single teen mom drops her baby off with Dr. Pat, I just found it a little too silly. Too implausible even for Evanovich.I guess I'm a bit bored of the sterotypical 'single people who cannot cook...' humor. Been there read that. Also the cutsey baby humor and the way the heroine oozes over the baby made me roll my eyes. If I'd known this was one of those baby books I'd never have picked it up.I gave up halfway through when the heroine and the doctor conspire to keep the baby for the holidays... I just found I could not maintain any interest.2 stars."
4,Thanksgiving,How could you not love Janet's writing?!?! I have read all 18 of the Stephanie Plum series & I can't wait for # 19!
1,Too Silly,"The main character, Meagan, is very silly. and the Pediatrician, Pat, is not realistic. This story might work for a twelve year old if there were not any sez."
4,Author always gives a fun read,"Cute for the season, Janet Evanovich never fails at giving her readers a fun laugh out loud read. This book was short and sweet."
2,Good Show.... DVD's not,"The show itself is great and love it but not the DVD-R's, to many problems. In other: to cheap made - to expensive to buy.Also I dislike the set because none englisch subtitles are available (i'm foreign speaking and a bit deaf hearing). My mind: a DVD should have in 21th Century subtitles! Pasta!!!This Show others deserves a better release. I hate this greed of the Studios."
1,DVD-R's...High Price...??,"Ok, so they want $60 a season for a set that is DVD-R. No Thanks. I prefer a printed disc and normally shy away from the double sided, I have never purchased a set that has been burned.Correct me if I'm wrong but isnt that what the bootleggers do?? Burn sets on DVD-R's?? I'm not saying this is an illegal set, just saying it seems awful cheap to me.My 2 cents"
5,When will it be released,"Anyone any idea when Cheyenne season 2 is going to get a release date? Surely, following the positive response to the first season we are goibng to be treat with this and further seasons? Why do the tv and dvd etc companies have to drag their heels so much, get it out while there is interest available!!!"
5,I can't waite to get the rest of them,I grew up watching the Cheyenne series and can't waite to get the rest of them.This set is better than the first season.
2,Save your money,"This product does not work very well. Does not glide on the fence very well, to tight and there is no adjustment for this. When using it to rip it tends to lift the board up and also away from the fence at the rear of the cut into the back of the blade giving you a bad cut in addition to a possible kick back. The finger does not grip the board very well and lifts off of it unless it is greater then 1"" thick so does not work well with 3/4"" stock.Seller was great and shipment arrived before the fence from Amazon."
3,A good mountaineering adventure,"Some stories are so good that no amount of bad writing can harm them. This is one. Blum's strident feminism and dislikable personality cannot harm this very exciting and ultimately tragic mountain adventure. Even though it is slightly shorter than Everest, Annapurna is just as brutally hard to climb. No less a climber than Anatoli Boukerev was killed on Annapurna. These brave women had to battle the mountain along with Sherpas and porters who were constantly extorting more and more money out of them. The final triumph and tragedy are profoundly moving. Jon Krakauer has raised the bar on these stories and this is not as good as ""Into Thin Air"", but it is a very good tale never the less."
5,An amazing adventure,"One of my New Year's Resolutions was to start reading non-fiction books this year (I'm a sci-fi junkie!). As someone who loves the outdoors, I thought _Annapurna: A Woman's Place_ would be a good place to start. I was not disappointed. Told in a straightforward, autobiographical manner without a lot of embellishment, this book was none-the-less fascinating. I found it very difficult to put down, and I constantly wanted to know what happened next. I was surprised that Ms. Blum stressed the climbing aspect of her team's adventure and actually downplayed the fact that they were a FEMALE climbing team, but I found this added to the appeal of her story. This is one of the few books I will unhesitatingly recommend to family & friends."
5,Read this book!,"Arlene Blum's book is the best mountain-climbing book I've ever read, by far, and as the daughter of a climber, I've read quite a few. This book excels because of its author. Her sensitivity, perceptiveness, and concern for others is evident throughout. She's also a good writer with a good story."
3,Great looking DVD,"Typical oater. Jimmy Stewart and Racquel Welch save it from being completely forgettable. Stewart and Dean Martin play brothers who fought on opposite sides of the civil war, but have both been damaged by the experience, and have a hard time staying on the straight and narrow. Martin's character rode with Quantrill (like the real-life James and Younger brothers), and now robs banks for a living, an outlaw with a heart of gold, at no time do we believe he's really a bad man.But what a splendid looking DVD! The image quality is absolutely perfect. Looks like a movie filmed last year, not one filmed 36 years ago. Both the image and sound quality are way, way above average, what every DVD release should be but very few are. The image quality is better than what this movie really deserves."
4,One Word Makes It All Worthwhile!,"I enjoyed this movie (what's not to like? Dean and Jimmy? ) One thing stands out; it is Raquel Welch, in her questionable Spanish accent, saying to Deano...""they are Bandolero..."" Make sure to catch the look on her face! Priceless!"
1,Bandolero!,"Starts off great with a bank robbery then the hangman comes and things get interesting, but it is boring and Raquel Welch despite her beauty is annoying with that accent,I prefer The Man With No Name Trilogy than this. No other western can compare."
2,slow...,I like westerns but in this film Raquel Welch and Dean Martin were down your capacities. Ever will be nice look Welch 's body but the film is only that.
4,The Mild Bunch,"An earlier band of bank robbing killers head to Mexico in this anti-heroic Western. But don't look for the operatic perversity of Leone or the nihilism of Peckinpah, just the expert craftsmanship of the underrated helmer Andrew V. McLaglen. The picture is very tightly edited and the shots are neatly framed and can be savored on this well restored DVD. The film's first section with Jimmy in a stovepipe hat is priceless. After that he steps back to play matchmaker to Dean and Raquel, although he does have one terrific bit where he freaks out with self-righteousness that is perfectly played. (And I'm not sure where else you can see him rob banks and shoot it out with the law.) George Kennedy is also very good as the stalwart lawman who carries an improbable torch for la Welch."
2,The First Thirty Minutes are Great,"The opening bank robbery is gripping. Then Jimmy Stewart comes in and steals the film as the ingenious brother who impersonates a hangman to free the Bishop gang on the gallows. I watched the film on AMC just now and for the first half hour I was thinking ""Why have I never heard of this amazing western?""I should have turned off the TV right there. The second 2/3rds is one long slow chase scene through the Mexican desert with a big shooting finish. Yawn."
5,great western,"i am a big fan of westerns and especially if they have dean martin or john wayne in them in this case dean martin, i would buy any film with him in it as he is a very good actor and singer though he does not sing in this film, james stewart is also in this excellent western, dean martin and his gang are to be hanged and james stewart posing as the hangman who is in fact the brother of dean in the films breaks them free and they go on the run with a hostage (raquel welch) with the lawman who fancies her in hot persuit. this is a very good film and entertaining."
4,Passable Western.,"I think Jimmie Stewart does the best job as the older, seemingly more responsible brother. Early on he impersonates a hangman, rescues his brother and then robs a bank on the way out of town. Only Robert Mitchum could have done it better."
3,Bandolero,"I have always admired Jimmy Stewart as an actor and an individual (that's why I purchased the movie). Even though I understand the concept of poetic justice, I did not feel like there was much depth to this story. Of course, I should have known what to expect when Raquel Welch was the female lead. If Jimmy Stewart is one of your favorites, don't waste your time on this story. Go back to ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" or ""Shenandoah"". That's ""classic"" Stewart."
3,poor customer service,I ordered this for my brother and they sent it to my address. My brother livesin a different state. I notified them but they refused to help. Poor customer setrvice.
5,Outstanding,"Gerald Astor has brilliantly put together an easy to read history of US Navy carrier warfare during World War 2. From the battles between American and Japanese aircrews, the underlying animosity between the Army and Navy on how to win the war and the ongoing differences between the 'fleet admirals' and the 'air admirals' on how best to use the carriers, Astor weaves an outstanding record of those tumultuous times.His use of first hand accounts of aerial combat are unsurpassed, detailed and very readable. It puts you right in the thick of the action, almost as you were there yourself. I highly recommend Wings Of Gold to anyone who has an interest in Navy carrier ops and the men who heroically flew combat in WW2."
5,One of the best albums that T-Bone Burrnett has produced!,Simply put this is the very best album that T-Bone Burnett has produced in my opinion. Pretty Little Lonely is Pretty Nearly Perfect if you ask me. I love the songs Mr. Smile and Queen for a Day. No one will be sorry when they add this cd to their music collection. Michael played in Carnival Art before this album and I enjoy their albums as well but this one is the best.
4,A general history,"This book is a general history of the environment as interfaced with politics in Southeast Asia. I'd recommend it as a college textbook for students not familiar with Southeast Asia, but interested in environmental issues there."
1,Cheap but mediocre,"Got this as a compliment point and shoot digital camera, replacing a number of Nikon CoolPix models that I have used in the past. The immediate impression was of the cheap fabrication feel: the bad fit and the poor plastic material used. Next in using the camera I am not finding any manual white balance and the camera will run out of battery in less than 30 pictures(!) and 'no', it does not come with a rechargeable battery -so go figure... As for picture quality it quite poor as well and I get the idea that they have stretched the capabilities of the imaging chip way too far when taking 6MP out of a component that is maybe good for half...I would not recommend this camera to anyone, not even to beginners: start with a camera like this and you're not going to grow the hobby..."
2,Okay for the price,"For the price it may be an all right camera but the few sample shots I took didn't seem to have nearly the clarity of pictures taken with my Fuji digitals. I didn't have the camera long basically because the layout of the buttons and menus was very different than my Fuji mind could tolerate. I do love the black body though! As to the battery life, everyone is right. It will destroy a fresh set of alkaline batteries in a few shots - but that's typical for many digital cameras. By the way, I never found out how to get the icons off the LCD while taking pictures and the manual is almost worthless."
2,In the trashcan now,"After using this camera for several months, I threw it out after it broke for the last time I wanted to deal with it. I thought this would be a decent camera due to the easy-to-use features and the pictures taken being adequate for the price. The computer interface was not as user-friendly as other digital cameras I've had or seen, but the battery consumption was a bigger problem. Taking about 15-20 pictures was average for me before having to reload another set of batteries. That can become expensive. Worse is finding the lens ""freezes"" when the batteries are low and one changes them. The lens on mine refused to open after the last battery change. After finding out this was a common problem, I got a more dependable camera."
4,"Good Camera, Bad Battery usage","Great shots, but carry spare batteries. It doesn't tell you when the batteries are low, just all of a sudden, no juice. But the pictures are great! Easy to use, and download. The download needs the special enclosed USB cable instead of a standard USB cable. I just take out the SD card and put it in my reader."
1,Do not buy this camera,After a few months this camera does not work.With new recharged batteries just shows 'low battery'.Service is hard to get also.Look elsewhere.
2,"Takes great pictures, but disappointing durability","I've had this camera for a little over a year. The thing takes wonderful pictures-when you can use it. First of all, the battery life is terrible. Most alkaline batteries peter out after a couple dozen shots in this camera. About three months in, the camera started randomly switching between modes, and about 6 months in, the flash died. I'm disappointed in the quality of this thing, and hope my next camera performs better."
1,Terrible...,"For about a month, my Samsung worked O.K. (given the frequent battery changes--to lithium) but after that, this camera turns on for about 4 seconds and then beeps 3 times and shuts off. The end. I'm thoroughly dissapointed."
5,excellent,i ordered this product and it is great.it takes great pictures and it gives you a good view.i would highly recommend this camera
2,Incredible battery life,"I'm considering returning this camera.Functions are not so bad considering the price.But, battery life is really short. It's maybe because this camera does not work on the voltage which is a little lower than full.I could use the battery battered from this camera for the other camera."
2,I hate this camera,I bought this camera because they didn't have the Kodak camera that I wanted in stock...I am so disappointed in this camera the battery life is so short I wouldn't recommend this camera to anyone I will stick to Kodak.
1,Not Worth Buying,"I bought this camera new from J&R in New York and it lasted less than a year (or about 3, 2-week trips). I paid $89.99 plus tax and when I went to have it repaired I was quoted $80.00 and told by a third-party repair service that the problem with the lens was very common with this camera and brand. The picture quality and other features are no better or worse than you might expect but there is no durability. It breaks down at the one-year mark (end of warranty). In short, it is a piece of Chinese-made JUNK."
4,Good camera for kids,"I bought two of these cameras for my kids. They are easy to use and have a variety of use options (timer, video, still shots). My one critique is they burn through batteries fairly fast, so use rechargeable AA's instead of disposable!"
3,"not the best, not the worst","Not the best camera in the world, but it is pretty inexpensive. Battery life is absolutely HORRIBLE, I have to change them very often. Good for kids or preteens."
2,Good pictures but low battery life,"This a is an overall good camera. Great pics, lots of different options, but the reason i give it 2 stars is because Of battery life.The batteries on my camera last barely 5 minutes, usually around 3 1/2-4 mins.. Ive gone through 2 22 packs of double a batteries in the 3 weeks ive had it.Ive decided just to leave it rather than sped wayy more money on double A's.Pros:Great picturesLots of cool optionslightinexpensiveCompatible with many different types of cardsTakes Relatively good movies.ConsLow battery lifeLot of shutter lagthere appears to be no battery savers optionNO VIEWFINDER Just BATTERY EATING lcd screen."
4,Great Camera!,"I was very disappointed with the battery life when I bought this camera. They only lasted about a half hour. But I found out that you really need the 2500mah NiMh rechargeable batteries. They last forever. The outdoor pictures are very crisp and clear, especially if you put the sharpness all the way up. The indoor pictures though, I'd say there about average. The photo-editing system on this camera is amazing once you figure out how to use it. Overall I'd say this is a perfect point and shoot camera, especially for the price of $99."
2,Samsung digital S630,Quality of the picture is average for a point and shoot. User friendliness is average. With only the screen to frame your picture bright sunlight can be a problem.The biggest downside to this camera is battery life. Eight pictures and the camera shuts down. Upon checking the battery with a battery indicator power indicator they still register high to normal power. So..if you aren't taking more than a dozen pictures you might be able to accomplish that feat with just two batteries.
2,"Ok, but what can I expect for $90?","I suppose the camera is fine enough for a non-camera nerd, but for me, I felt the quality just wasn't there compared to other Samsung products I own. The bulge on the side of the lens is very big and the pictures on the internet don't really show that. Take my advice and if you are planning on buying this, go to an actual store and check it out in real life. I ended up sending it back without even trying it out because I was so unimpressed with the shape and size."
3,Buy something better.,This camera is ok but it doesn't take terribly good pictures. If you want to get a camera buy something better.
1,not worth it,"It has nice features, which was why I bought it. At first it even seemed to do okay on battery life, I liked it. Now it kills batteries without using it - it may have a short. Today it started shutting down while zooming in on a subject. It shuts down at a consistent point in the zoom, so I think it could be a bare wire, etc; something that causes the power to go to 0 as it abruptly shuts-off.It hasn't traveled much nor been used much."
5,makes a great gift!,"I purchased the camera as a gift for someone else, but from what I hear, she's very pleased with the camera.."
3,Description,"She was a winner--against her will!After a marriage that wasn't particularly happy, Damaris Gordon had decided she could do without further romantic involvements. Raising her young daughter and living a quiet, well-ordered life was contentment enough.Then, one night, Damaris attended a charity function, and to her complete shock and surprise, won a contest she hadn't even known she'd entered--for a ""celebrity"" date with well-known entrepreneur Joel Agar. A date she hadn't even wanted....Joel was handsome, successful and far too arrogant for her liking. But after their date, Damaris had to admit she was attracted to him. Strongly attracted. And despite their constant arguing, Joel must have felt the same way. Why else would he keep sending her roses?"
5,A company you can trust,"The robe was exceptionally nice, but I had to return it because it was too large to pack into a carry-on. My grandson wanted a microfiber travel robe and this one did not fit the bill. However, the company was so easy to deal with and so concerned that I would be satisfied. I will try to order through them in the future, just because they were so responsive. My credit card was credited without delay."
3,Torn pocket!,"Before buying this product, I read several reviews where everyone wrote that the robe was extremely thick and warm. Upon receiving my order, in that aspect, it did live up to my expectations. However, on Christmas morning, I gave my husband his wrapped present, and upon trying it on, he was the one to point out to me that the pocket was torn. 3 months later, rather than going through the hassle of returning it, I finally sat down today to sew the pocket!"
2,It's ok,"When I saw it I thought that it would be nice and soft, the material is kind of rough feeling."
5,Great Gift!,"Affordable, toasty warm and super comfortable! I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it (especially the longer sleeves). It's so comfy I've been wearing it almost more than my own robe. It seemed soft enough when he first opened it, but after a wash with a bit of softener it was noticeably softer. Would definitely recommend this robeEdit: After about a year of use, I've noticed a big downside: it catches pet hair like crazy! Otherwise, still very soft and comfy."
3,nice but very heavy,"I wanted to try out a microfleece robe because I like that material, but I was worried it would be too warm. I was right. If you like a heavy thick soft material, then this is your robe. However, if you take hot showers and are looking for something light that absorbs some water, this is not your robe. The sleeves are super thick and long (to where they need to be rolled up to make it even thicker). Both my boyfriend and I never really wear this robe- unless I'm freezing- then it can easily warm you up!"
5,Microfleece Robe,I'm very satisfied with this product on top that it was delivered fast. Very comfy and warm specially for these winter months.
4,Very warm robe.,"I bought this robe as an early Christmas present for my husband, but he found it, and has been wearing it every day after his bath. He loves it, and it's not like the thick cotton kind that frays with every wash. It fits him well, and he's got kind of shorter arms, so the fact that the robe's arms fold over are a plus. I did have to get my husband another, lighter robe, however, for use during summer time. This robe is a little TOO warm for summer, but perfect for cooler weather."
4,Great Robe!,"The only reason I took one star away is because I'm pouting that I couldn't get the robe in the color I wanted. Other than that, this robe was an excellent buy for my boyfriend who is 6'3 with some of the longest arms you've ever seen. The robe fits him beautifully and keeps him fabulously warm and comfy. I tried it on just to see how it felt and, while it was incredibly comfortable, it immediately warmed me up to the point where I had to take it off, so if you get hot quickly, this might not be the best choice for you. My boyfriend couldn't be happier with the fit and the comfort and I couldn't be happier with the price. All around, a very positive purchase!"
5,"very warm and cozy, everyone in the family likes it!","I bought it as a Christmas gift for my husband. He felt in love with it as soon as he tried it on, and dumped his old heavy towel robe at once! Even my 6 yrs old daughter and myself like to be wrapped in it. It is so warm and cozy as said in other reviews. I'd like to buy more for my family members if they have kids and women sizes. The price is unbeatable too!!"
3,"ONLY fits CLOSED BASE 14"" Delta Band Saws",Don't buy this if you have an open base bandsaw measuring 19inches by 30.5inches. This base will not fit that size saw stand. The HTC base I received did not fit my saw and I had to return it. Measure your stand before you order.
4,Great with the curatins,"I received the sugar plum curtains as a shower gift, and this valance really pulls the room together. I originally only got 1 and realized I needed 2, so be sure to make sure you get enough to fit your window. I only wish they weren't so costly, but I really like them and would definitely get them again."
2,"Too expensive, but it matches the rest of the bedding","I only bought this because it matched all the rest of the bedding. I purchased 3 of them, for the two windows, and none of them valance covers are exactly alike. There are slight variations, in color, to each one.Bottom line:Too expensiveVariations in colorsBut matches the rest of the bedding"
2,"Not a good flash drive, over priced","This drive was reasonable for about 2 weeks, then it broke (not recognized anymore) I'm in IT so I deal with alot of flash devices, this one was a gift and at $50 this thing should have been bullet proof. Instead it feels like something I got out of a 25 cent toy machine at Wal-Mart. It scratches very easy and has slow write speeds. I've gotten two of these and both became unusable very quickly. Flash drives are cheap now, 8 GB goes for about $6 if you look in the right places, do your self a favor and pick up a couple of those before you even think about this one. DON'T BUY!"
4,Excellent Device,"I have own Sony Microvaults since the 2 GB series. They have been proven to be reliable and fast. The Compression software is useful, but can not be utilized unless you are an administrator. Considering it is a sony product and the size of the device the price is excellent."
3,The Essiac Expose,"A great starting point in understanding Essiac and the woman who dedicated her life to cancer patients. The medical establishment has not offered a cure for cancer, but many have sworn that their cancer was eliminated or diminished using the herbal formula. This book offers hope and a starting point for people interested in tackling cancer. The Essiac formula is not offered in this publication, which is a shame, but it can be found on the web in association with the author's name."
5,History of a Cancer controlling herb and the nurse that made it available to the masses,"The doctor gives a accurate history of Rene Caisse and the Canadian Indian herbs that help you fight cancer. It is working with me and I am telling everyone I encounter about it. I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of bladder cancer. The planned treatment was a biopsy, Chemo therapy, and removal of the bladder, prostate, and lymph glands. Following three sessions of chemo, I started taking Essiac capsules. I asked the doctor to do the cystoscopy and not the surgery. In three follow up cystos there has only been scar tissue and a polyp. The polyp was burned and I will have another cysto in March. Now there is no talk of surgery unless there is a recurrence."
5,Hope and health for cancer folks.,This is a great book for enlarging the options in cancer care and prevention. I have shared it a lot and make lots of the tea. The tea if helpful for other conditons as well.
4,Informative!,"Very personal account. It gave me information I did not have. I would like to order the video, however am concerned it may not still be available at the 1-800 number. Having said that, enjoyed the book very much."
3,Nothing new,"With all the great reviews I thought this book would be something earth-shattering and contain things specifically for artists and other creatives. But it's really just your basic ""positive thinking"" stuff that's been in millions of other books, and which can be applied to any goal in life, not just artistic goals. It's a fine book if that's all you want. But if you are looking for something to really jolt your creativity this isn't it."
2,Don't buy it,"I have Fearless Creativity this book has the same process orientated view mood about it. Pick up the book ""Inspiring Creativity"" instead which is a anthology and has views of 22 different creativity coaches. But the Intro is written by Erik :)"
5,Coaching Myself to Success,"Eric Maisel's newest is a gem. I read it all at one sitting - I couldn't put it down. I don't consider myself ""blocked"" as a writer, but I learned how to be even more open creatively through his techniques and stories. It was so encouraging to find out how many other people shy away from their own potential, and that by acknowledging what we are doing we can overcome our own blind spots. Maisel teaches us to coach ourselves through the blocks to greater success."
1,This is a horrible book.,"This was one of the worst books I have ever read, though I did make it through it. Hallowe'en is only incidental in that the storyline takes place on that one night. There was very little suspense and lots of confusion. Maybe it's one of those artsy books you're not supposed to understand. I have read thousands of books in my lifetime and this rates right down at the bottom. Sorry, Mr Greer, I just didn't get it."
3,Review of the Blu-ray edition,"Independent of the film, I am a bit disappointed by the Blu-Ray release.1. Bitrate for the Audio track is 448kbps (5.1) and 192kbps (2.0)...some DVDs have a higher bitrate!2. Subtitles are forced. I don't speak Thai, so I would have to watch it with subtitles anyways but I would prefer they not be imprinted on the image.3. Video quality is just OK...I understand the film was shot on 16mm film, but it the transfer is not the best."
3,"More ""interesting"" than ""entertaining""","""Uncle Boonmee"" is sometimes amusing. Often perplexing. Occasionally intriguing. Ultimately, ""Uncle Boonmee"" falls more toward being ""interesting"" than toward being ""entertaining""."
2,Emporer's New Clothes,"A slow abstract meditation on death that is not at all entertaining. You're probably not going to actually like this, or glean much from it. Don't feel guilty. Just because a movie like this is generally unwatchable and quite impenetrable doesn't make it high art. I submit that you that this is really just fetishistic weirdness dressed up as sophisticated musing."
1,Don't believe the hype.,I wish I enjoyed this movie. Lots of great shiny images but sadly it moved so slowly that I fell asleep at the theatre.
1,Deep Techno = ZZZZZZZ,"I suppose this is the type of music you play when the club is winding down, or if you`re a DJ and you need an unremarkable 4/4 track to act as a bridge from one song to the next. ""Thump thump thump"" with minimal noises and minimal progression for an entire CD is no way to spend your money."
5,"Ohhhhhhh,man!","This CD is just so amazing!My favorite songs on this album are:I've always loved you,believe,your love oh Lord ,and give.These 4 songs I would say,when Third day wrote these songs they really reached down into their hearts.But,let me tell you,there is no missteps or fillers.I would really recommend this album."
5,Christian Rock at its best!,"This CD is a bit older from Third day but is probable one of the best Christian CD's out there. I would love to see them get back into God's Word and sing about it. I know that there recent CD, The Wire, is trying to draw in the unchurched but for us worshippers it is always good to stay strong in are faith. This is a must have, for anyone who loves a little rock and loves Jesus Christ. What a great testament."
2,Disappointment,Third Day really changed the world of Christian music with their first album. The second album blew the first one away. This album was a big disappointment. I am afraid the guys are getting away from their style.
3,not their best by far,i never liked this CD. i picked it up before it came out and rarely listened to it. their second album is their best and even that album is not that great. i would say don't buy unless you are a third day freak.
4,awsome! they totaly blow you away with this album!,this recording by Thidr day is so far the best I have heard since their song from the Exodus album. They show a lot of fellings in this and you can almost fell their closeness to GOD! I recomend that if you like this Group buy it right away. You know you want it.
2,Little to look forward to,I heard so much hype on this CD and I was sadly disappointed when I heard it. I couldn't even listen past the 5th song. I would suggest to listen to it before buying.
4,Third Day--Three in a row!,"This is a very cool album...""I've Always Loved You"" is just absolutely amazing lyrically. It really gives you a great persepective on the Love that Jesus has waiting for all those who will except Him. ""Sky Falls Sown"" is just a flat-out rocker in traditional 3D fashion! Pick up this album...I saw them in concert just a few months ago and was blown away by the performances of the songs on 'Time.' Thanks and God Bless!"
5,Third Day is the man,Me..the biggest third day fan of them all was a little disappointed when I listened to this CD. But how can I not give my favorite band less than 5 stars? But after listening to it a couple times I looked past how much more country they grew and fell in love with the words. Third Day will always cheer me up on a cloudy day! I did like how the songs matched their theme. However when they come out with their next album i hope it's a lot more rock...nonetheless 3day will always amaze me by their awesome lyrics and showing the world they are in love with God.
3,machine covers,"this cover is as advertised. it lets the machine breathe, but keeps the dust off. I plan on buying more of these"
5,GREAT MACHINE COVERS,"After years of battling light rust powder due to condensation I have finally found the solution. I have tried every thing from canvas to plastic and rubber covers, all sweat to a degree. I bought a couple of these machine covers and have found that they really work well. I would strongly recommend these machine covers to anyone with a rust problem."
5,5 Stars 4 Sure,"Not Big enough for Table Saws as pictured but it covers every thing else..... Jig saws Belt sander's my 18 1/2 Planer etc. Magnet's keep cover in place while I blow down my shop and cover keeps most dust, dirt and dampness of my machine tops......... worth EVERY Penny! Buy several!"
3,Not Water Proof,"Liquids have been spilled on my table saw with the cover on more than once. I of course did not know it. On each occurrence, the liquid went right through the cover and I ended up with a big rust stain on the table saw. So don't count on the cover keeping liquids off your tools."
4,Further Information on the Title,The title of this song is the name of a chapter in Charles Baudelaire's book of poetry Les Fleurs du Mal (Flowers of Evil). It's a fabulous book - this guy was Goth before the original Gothic Revival happened.
4,Toward the...,"...well, toward the Dead Can Dance sound, I suppose. This release was the beginning of DCD's move away from the 'typical' 4AD label sound of darkish, goth-pop-styled music and atmospherics to begin to craft a sound that took advantage of a multitude of musical influences. And you do see some of this, particularly Western classical directions, starting to make major impacts here and there on this album. But by and large, there's still a lot of that 4AD feel here as well. A mixed bag, albeit a very well-done one. But I'd suggest skipping this, going on to the next album (""Within the Realm of a Dying Sun""), then coming back here if that clicks with you."
3,Lean deal,3 1/2Another textural triumph sidelined from greatness from a too short running time and the few songs which feel more like typical darkened 80's new-age instead of the personal world music only they cultivated.
2,Not Your Typical DCD,"I have only been into Dead Can Dance for the last few months. I have purchased most of their cds. I can honestly tell you that this was the worst one I have heard. The vocals are too heavy and so is the music. Where is the lightness of Lisa Gerrard? A better choice would be Spirit Chaser. That one is mesmerizing. Plenty of airy vocals and pounding yet soothing instrumental work. An even better choice is Lisa Gerrard's Duality. It takes you to places you have never been before. If you want to really feel the music you are listening to, Duality is a must."
4,A & C With Two of The Three Stooges,"I think this is the only Abbott and Costello made where they had two of The Three Stooges in it. I am referring to one of the Curly clones and Shemp. Since A & C had America screaming, why not give Africa the same treatment? Screaming with laughter, of course. A & C end up in Africa and finding out they have been dupped into finding diamonds for crooks. I have seen many A & C movies over and over again but this one seems to have been shelved for a long time and I have no idea why. Thanks to the market of VHS and DVD, the movie is in our hands and will keep us laughing as we want."
2,Miss Balmain,"Don't let the pink bottle fool you, this fragrance is neither sweet nor girlie. After reading the notes on Fragrantica I felt like this was a ""must have"" but the opening is so strong/awful hairspray & leather that it obliterates the potential for me to detect any notes. Comes off very masculine, but not in a spicy/musky way. More like a bitter/green masculine with Lemon Pledge in there. I don't HATE Miss Balmain. It doesn't give me migraines or make me want to gag, but I certainly do not like it. I have 95% full 3.3 oz bottle that's just been sitting in my jewlery drawer for months."
5,Cool Mixes,"Cool mixes and I enjoyed the selection. Buyer beware though the CD does have explicit lyrics and only on Track 5, so don't play if little kids are in the car."
4,A brilliant non-technical explanation that should be a lesson to current authors,"When people are talking about quantum mechanics as being Bohr and Einstein-Bohmthey forget de Broglie and Heisenberg. In this masterful book like Einstein's popular""The Meaning of Relativity"" equations aren't left out, but are used to make points clear that words can't.After reading David Lindley's ""Weirdness"" I thought of de Broglie and his wave particle duality.It is a weirdness that we now take for granted because of books like this one.Our authors of today are cowards and small men because they won't face the equations."
1,An exercise in pure trash,"This movie has all the makings of a usual sexploitation flick, however this goes overboard with excessive sexual violence and degradation. It starts out with 3 completely naive schoolgirls and a boyfriend, of course one of them is a virgin, on their way to a party, take a wrong turn and run into three cliched mexicans. They are tortured, raped, degraded in the most brutal of fashion. The bottle scene is one of the most sickest, revolting scenes in this movies. The 2nd half is all about bloody revenge, the killings are original but way over the top especially the abortion scene.Avoid this movie at all costs."
1,"Fake, Wannabe Rapper Whose Just an Idiot!","This cd flopped and the reasons are all too obvious. First, I am glad that it did. Second, this idiot has no talent. I can't stand him because he thinks he is ""it"", has a taste and desire for white women and spanish chicks like j.ho, and makes himself look like a fool for sweating her slutty ***. He has no morals, either-2 bastards out of wedlock, more than likely more that we don't know about or probably paid some $lut off to abort, while parading around with his 2 bastard kids. Not only that, the fact that he has to sample other people's music and most of his songs are samples from true musicians says alot about this idiot and his so-called ""talent"". I don't care how much people stress that we need to support our own successfuly Black people, this idiot gets on my nerves, loves the white or light chicks, and does nothing for me, except to be a true, everlasting annoyance!"
1,this cd can't get no sorrier,this is the worst cd i ever heard in my life-what the h**was puffy thinking-i guess that's why it didn't go platnum
1,forever it shall remain unlistened to...,"It is simply mind-numbing that anyone could stand this for more than 5 seconds. This is the same as before. Same beats, same dull, mumbling rapping. This guy couldn't write a SONG to save his life. But, at least it's been a sales flop, thankfully. Save your money, he is richer than he should be already. And next time someone calls one of these hacks musicians, I am going to get sick."
1,Nothing at all...,"I've listened to many Albums in my life, and only a few times (this was one) I really regret it! Puff Daddy takes good old songs, and makes bad old songs of them. If you want HipHop, take Eminem or Dre....this Album is nothing at all!"
1,"""shaking head""",If you gave this Album more than 1 star .. Then good keep your R and B.. thats all this album is...
4,Still loving it after 2nd buy!,"Production is great! We forget how music is supposed to be. Not taking anything away from these guys nowadays who are getting their money putting out garbage (see Gucci Mane & O.J. Da Juiceman) but this is when music was still good! Diddy or P. Diddy, or Puffy or Puff Daddy.... perhaps Diddy Dirty Money has never been lyrical, but he put it best ""I'm not a rapper, I'm an entertainer"". And this album was entertaining. With appearances from Shyne, Jay-Z and the likes, it was a solid effort back when music was about something. That's why I bought it again after I lost it a few years ago."
5,awesome cd,"Great album Puff, I loved it. How do you keep coming out withsuch big hits. Your a champion Puffy, keep on writing. Don't listen to those who say you steel lyrics cuz they're lying.Write on Puff. RIP Notorious BIG"
3,Not as interesting as the other books in the series...,"This is a short story of a young borrower, Stainless, who was asked to go 'borrow' a bit of parsley from the human beings. Borrowing a bit of parsley is a simple job for any borrower, even young ones. Maybe a 5-minute job. But little Stainless was gone for a whole day and night. His mother was very worried about his safety, so the borrower grandfathers, passed an order that all borrowers, no matter male or female (except the very young ones), form search parties to look for Stainless. You have to read the rest to find out what happened because if I go on with the review, you'll know what happened in the end as it is really a very short story. Happy reading!"
4,"Fits good, but very slippery","They do not fit as snugly as in picture, but do cover all the floor.They seam to be good quality rubber.The only problem I foresee is that they are very slippery (especially when wet) They have nowhere for melting snow or water from shoes to go. So you will be driving in the puddle of water. Solution we found is to use 2 mats (not on the driver floor though). On top of these mats - put regular deep channeled rubber mat. This way Weather Tech will collect all the overflow but main water/dirt will be collected by deep channeled mat."
4,Thank You.....,Thank you for the cd. It came very quickly and i got a listen right away in the car. I reallly like some songs and some were much different than the other cd i have of Tish..... Thanks again.
4,Gets lots of use,I purchased this house for my in home day care. So we have lots of toddlers playing with it! They love it! The only complaint I have is that the door falls off easily if the child pushes it instead of pulls it. But the kids all fit in there and even bring chairs. Even the one year old loves it! He likes to play peek a boo with the shutters. Lots of fun and well worth the money.
4,great toy,"My 20 month old loves it. Only one thing you should know before you start putting it together, you really need a cordless screw driver. You can do it without one, but it won't be any fun."
3,Not what I thought,"The book is pretty much cartoony horror characters,like youd see on Scooby-Doo.It wasnt what I expected.I thought it would have life-like drawing instruction also.The drawing instructions dont really give a detailed explanation.It shows-Beggining,Middle & Finished.Only 3 instructional images per character.It wasnt worth the $9.99 I paid for it,at least to me."
5,Great series for history studies!!!,"We are a homeschooling family and we have thoroughly enjoyed the ""Famous Men"" series for our world history studies. I highly recommend it! The ""Famous Men"" books are core texts and the study guides have helpful questions, vocabulary words, project ideas and recommendations of other great books to expand the study. The ""Famous Men"" books were written in 1904. Greenleaf Press has republished them and written study guides to go with them. Contrary to the insinuation in a previous review, the ""Famous Men"" books are not in use in the New York public school system unless an individual teacher chooses to provide her students with a classical education. Frankly, we chuckled at the pornography charge of the previous review. It is a bit of a stretch."
4,Very interesting for young minds,"My 5th grader can't seem to put it down. It is filled with classical paintings (though in black and white) and on one there is some nudity, as there ususally was in the paintings of history. We covered that up with a black marker, but on the whole it is very tastefully done. For learning the history of Greece it makes a great supplement."
3,"Sure, go ahead and buy this book....","I found the book to be informative, however, I am not impressed with the style of writing. It does not have a nice flow to it. In some instances, it is choppy and unclear. Also, being that this is a book on ancient Greece, the author should have consistently used the Greek God's names and not the Roman. I did not like having to change the names myself and improve upon the writing style as I read aloud to my children. But, over all it is a decent book; and I do recommend it along with the student guide and teacher guide to ""Famous Men of Greece."""
3,I liked this book.,My daughter is using this book for Greek studies along with the workbook from Memoria Press. She is using the eBook version of this book. Her biggest frustration has been the fact that it mixes up the Roman and Greek names for the gods. That makes this a very poor primary text. D'Aulaire's book is far superior at least for the Greek gods portion for the same audience.
3,"Solid information, text only no pics","I am a homeschooling mom who is introducing Greek and Roman history to my children. Haaren's writing is good, but it is mere text. The edition put out by Memoria Press has beautiful illustrations which makes it much more effective with young ones."
1,Not what I was looking for,"This is obviously written for high school or younger, so it didn't contain much detail. It is probably OK for its intended purpose, but of little value to me."
4,Summer in a tube,"Not only is this extremely helpful for chapped lips, the smell is a Proustian overload of summer nostalgia. As soon as you open it, all those summers around the pool, bbq's at the lake, and slathering on sunscreen galore come flooding back. You can't put this balm on without wanting to jump in a pool with all your clothes on. Unless of course, it's the middle of winter."
3,Pretty good :),"I'm a history buff doing research for my own book about a girl growing up in Czechoslovakia, so this book was really quite helpful. Olga's journey from teenage selfishness to self-awareness is really pronounced in the book, whether it's going to her first party or running away from the boy who broke her heart in the middle of the night or trying to make herself sick and die to get revenge on her mother. And yes, it does drag a bit at times, and Olga can be a bit of an overbearing, selfish character, but she's supposed to be. You're supposed to identify with her, not like her.All in all, I really did enjoy this book only because it made me feel a bit more normal in how I react to the world around me, being a teenager myself. :)"
1,BORING!!!...,this book didnt have much of a plot-...IF ANY!!!UGHH!! I wasted my time reading this;this book shouldhave ZERO(0)STARS!!!!
2,seriously overpriced,"Toby Wilkinson, a well-respected young British Egyptologist, has gathered together all known published information about the Palermo Stone and 6 other associated fragments and added a little of his own. The resulting text is spread thinly over some 300 pages including 12 line-drawings.I was disappointed that such an expensive volume did not even have any photographs of the objects being described. At 20 this book would be reasonable value but at 150 it is an unnecessary extravagance. I'm glad that I borrowed a copy from the British Library rather than buying it.In contrast, Toby Wilkinson's ""Early Dynastic Egypt"" is a valuable and not outrageously priced work that should be on the shelves of every Egyptologist with interests in that period."
1,Poor text; misleading for beginners.,"I am an expert that has read numerous presentations of artificial neural networks -- for beginners as well as for experts. I cannot remember ever seeing a more misleading presentation than the one provided by this book. The text's grammatical constructs are poor and the basic principles of the subject are poorly presented. Understand, I don't give poor marks for its basic simplicity; I object to the poor, misleading presentation. Simplicity and accuracy are essential to a clear presentation of this topic and the goal of writing a simple text is a worthy one, but you will find much better material in other books...Awwww heck, you can find better material through a simple Google search. Just remember this quote from Albert Einstein: ""Things should be made as simple as possible -- and no simpler."""
1,Do not buy this book!,"I thought I'd found THE introductory book regarding neural nets.The concept is perfect, the info is all there, but the bookstyle and poor english is incredibly difficult to read andfollow.Considering the technical nature of the subject matter and thefact that the author is not english speaking one would thinkthat the draft would have been edited and checked by englishspeaking editors. This was not the case here.Steer clear - I found this book horribly frustrating to read(I still haven't finished it). Almost every single sentenceis marred by stuttering semantic and grammatical errors.Bitterly disappointing - and published by an American company..."
1,Not worth buying,I fully agree with HENRY970 from South Africa. Bosque has no idea about how to structure a book or a chapter. Please don't waste your money and time.

4,An introduction to the field for undergraduate students,"The book gives an introduction to the field, and is primarily aimed at undergraduate students from computer science or mathematics. I think that this text could also interest ordinary people."

2,Interesting average score,"I have not read this particular book, but I do find the reviews entertaining, especially the comments attached to the higher scores. My own built-in neural network smells a good deal of similarity in the high scoring entries. If you are cynical, take these out and use the remaining scores to average. I think you would be rather close to a single star."
1,"Worthless, a joke","I cannot believe that anyone could find something good to say about this book. I could handle the broken English if the book had any content. Most of the book is taken up with personal comments, introduction, appendices, etc. The discussion of the subject itself is equivalent to a short paper that is only suitable for beginners. Don't waste your money."
3,uneven,"It takes until the end of chapter 2 to even begin discussing the title ship. The book then discusses the career of a German ship and the feelings of it's crew, as seen by the British. The author acknowledges many British officers and historians who helped, and no Germans. Written only a few years after the war, most of the people involved were still alive and available to interview. Why didn't he?"
1,Seriously less of a product - not worth current price,"Sorry HTC, you've taken a great durable product and made it a throw-away instead. I have 5 of the older covers - (identified by black trim, heavyweigt backing material)and they've been very durable. This new unit, I've almost pushed a finger through it easily; hold it up to the light and it is almost transparent in places where the backing material threads were spread when the coating was sprayed on.Granted, my old covers cost $70, and although pricey they were durable and have stood up over time - 5 stars for the old. This one at $56 ranks 1 star only. I'm certain I'll be fashioning patches soon. Maybe if the price was $25 to match the throw-away quality I would rate higher, but come on,I use it in a shop for goodness sake.If this is representative of HTC's trend, I'm sure glad they aren't making my work gloves - ouch!"
2,NOT WATERPROOF,"Some how something with water in it got knocked over on the top of my table saw. Since I had the cover on, I did not realize it. You could image the sight I had when I took the cover off. A HUGE rust spot. This despite a generous coating of paste wax. So the cover might be good for keeping dirt off, but not damaging water."
5,These Are Addictive,"These are the best tool covers in the world. They protect, they breathe, they're durable and they're worth every penny. I have over a dozen and I've used them to avoid rust and damage for over 10 years. They are now a much lighter (more breathable?) material than they used to be, but I still rate them #1."
4,Blood of the Wolf Review,"This book isn't bad, it jumps into answering the technical questions about werewolf psychology and physiology that players are bound to ask at some point. Some new Gifts for the Wilderness and Urban are slated out. The final chapter of this book expands on the creation and play of Wolf-Blood characters. Overall the book is decent and full-fills a needed place for expanding more on the Wolf-Blood and what it means to be an Uratha."
2,"Event Logging for Developers, not administrators","I am a consultant, of sorts--I build networks, repair networks, etc. And I thought this book would give me a more thorough understanding of Windows NT's Event Logging service. Boy was I wrong.If you are a programmer/developer for WinNT, I'm sure this book will be a great help to you. More than 2/3 of it is taken up by ways to use the event logging API. It documents the calls and parameters involved in them, and occasionally preaches about what a ""good"" application should do with event logging.If you are an administrator (that doesn't write C++ code every day), however, stay away. This, like all O'Reilly books, is well written but, like many ORA books, is inappropriately titled. The information here that is useful to administrators can also be found in the Windows help files."
1,"Beautiful images, too bad about the rest...",When will Newark learn that gorgeous Mcbride illustrations do not mean he can write utter rubbish... So many errors it's actualy funny at times. At other times it's just sad to see nice art get wasted on a terrible book.
5,Grandmother,Gave this to my twin granddaughter's for Christmas! They love it! Great safe gift.Does not titter to high fir them...they are very sweet and smart 20 months old girls with personality plus!
1,not worth it!,"WOW this toy is cheap, but shipping and handling is over $100!!!!! don't waste your time. Do a little bit more searching and you'll find another toy just like this one for cheaper."
4,Sixties Charts,Joel Whitburn's compilation of all the Billboard Hot 100 charts of the 1960's provides you with every list of the most popular songs of the decade of change. You can mark the success of the teenyboppers and crooners of the early part of the decade to Beatlemania to the Motown explosion to the psychedelic sounds of the Summer of Love & finally the Woodstock generation taking over the end of the decade.
4,Heavyduty,"Nice, heavy cover available in several sizes. It would be nice if there were more sizes, but no reason that you couldn't cut it and sew in some new magnets along the new seems. The magnets are ok, but rare earth would be even better."
1,still did not recieve the right one,still did not recieve the right one. after the second time you would think they would send the proper one. not 36 x 36
4,An Excellent Learning Tool!,"I found the left and right hand drills in this book to be extremely helpful. Had a little trouble fully grasping some of their explanations (Circle of Fifths), but then I thinks that's to be expected considering the topic. I only wish they would Add a DVD to further solidify what's being taught in the book.All in all, it's a good book that's putting me well on my way to becoming a good bass player!"
1,Save your money,"Four tablets and twelve hours later and still no results. I tried this product on my stove burners and was very, very disappointed with the outcome. Package states that photos used are a dramatization. Wish I had realized that before I wasted my money."
2,GREASE BULLET DOESN'T CUT THE GREASE.,I saw the infomerical on tv. As usually I never really believe in any of them so I wait until they sell it locatally... They had it on sale at target. I took a stab at it because it was 9.99. It doesn't work like the infomerical. It clearly stated that no scrubbing is invovled. I tried it and do work to a point. It doesn't make any of your item shine like store bought new. I did take off some of the grease after I used the item please some elbow grease. I had to scrub it alot so I would say it doesn't really cut all the grease. I did help loosen the grease to make it easier to scrub it but by itself it say it a thumbs down. If you think you not going use elbow grease this product isn't for you.
3,"Actually, not bad...","I stumbled upon this product at Target last week. The first time I used 2 tablets and hot tap water....and after 6 hours, barely anything came off my stove top ceramic.Last night, I used six tablets and steaming hot water and left my stovetop components soaking overnight -- plus, I dropped my tea kettle in there too. This morning, I was pleasantly surprised to see that much of the baked on grease was indeed lifted, but the nutty thing is that my tea kettle now has a clean bottom and a still-greasy top! It clearly worked. And, now, I have to buy some more!I agree with the other two reviewers that it is not the miracle product advertised -- but if you are willing to use near boiling water and let your stuff soak overnight, perhaps you too, will be surprised by the result."
1,Rip Off,"I tried this on 2 different pans and it didn't make one bit of difference.don't buy it, it's a scam"
2,"I use it ONLY on my deep fat fryer and It does a great job, BUT","I use this product only for cleanig my deep fat fryer and it works quite well, but I've found that boiling the water in it does almost as well. The difference, I have to use an SOS pad after dumping the boiling water, but the dried on oil comes right off. SO, for the price>>>> Forget it. Use boiling water."
2,Bullett?,"I had some beautiful stainless steel pots that were tarnished almost immediately due to the wrong adjustment on my Gas stove. I saw the ad for the Grease Bullet and hoped it would be the answer to my problems. Admittedly, the pots were in use for about 1.5 years before I saw the commercial. I soaked two small pots overnight with HOT tap water and one tablet. Guess what? Nothing!! I saw no real difference in the results I was getting using good old elbow grease. I do, however, plan to try again using more tablets and more hot water. Glad I only bought one tube."
5,great present,"i got this from my mom and i'm happy cause she knew i wanted a basketball game. and then i played it for a long time cause the mini games were fun and i had fun playing dodgeball. then i started making a player and i tried to make one that looked like me but older and then i started playing and then i didn't know that there was a story. so yeah, i'm making my player famous now and trying hard to do the right things although sometimes i do what i wanna do and that gets people mad. i like this game and i think you should all know about it since i wanna try and play people my age online"

4,4 STARS ROMANTIC TIMES!~~,Charming tale of romance bursts with humor that will certainly delight readers!~ROMANTIC TIMES MAGAZINE
3,"FORMAT COULD BE BETTER, NOT AS GOOD AS THE OTHERS","I purchased the 'Linear IC ' Pocket Book and the 'Passive & Discrete' Circuit Pocket Book by Mr. Marston in this series which are very good. This, pocketbook edition is difficult to read with odd formatting. The paper used is an off white/yellow with black ink. The margins are excessively wide approximately 1.5 inches side to side and top to bottem which lends itself to smaller than necessary type size. I find it difficult to read for any length of time. Some of the print of the diagrams appear to bleed into the paper. It almost looks like the publisher was planning to place this text into a smaller physically sized book but changed their minds. This edition is from 1996 so it is a little dated. I purchased the 'Modern CMOS' Circuits Manual which is easier on the eyes with a larger format."
3,"it's ok but the book ""real life ,real spice ""is better",great book but if you really want a good read check out real life real spice by the spice girls because it has babey pictures and never before seen photos althoughe it does caust more it is all totally worth it!
5,Greatest Spice Girls Book Ever Made!,"I don't own this book, bt my friends had it, and I can't get it because it is out of print. I would do anything to own it. It is the greatest book, with the best pictures and information!"
5,The Best Spice Girls Book out there!,It was a great wonderful book and they should print more because it would be a big seller! I love the Spice Girls especially Emma!
3,This battery fits and works for my car key,"Bought this battery for my car key (with the keyless entry remote) about 6 months ago and installed it. No problem with fitting and much cheaper than buying from the dealer. The key still works well after 6 months, and probably will last a couple years.Update: the battery died after about 18 months after its initial installation into my car key. This is much shorter than the original battery, which lasted for almost 5 years. Reduce to 3-star rating for this reason."
1,It doesn't work!,"I purchased this Ultralast 1616 for my car remote. It doesn't work; even though it measures 3.26 volts. I think it is just too thin to make contact with the contacts in the remote. I tried bending up the contacts in the remote and still not luck. I found some Energizer brand cr1616 batteries and they are working perfectly. BE AWARE, you can not return this product."
2,Royal Enfield - The Complete Story,This book has a few nice colour photos and some old advertising posters. While it does give a very concise summary of the companies history it is overly full of engine specifications and is repetitive.
4,A great tribute to the films of Alfred Hitchcock,"This video is a must for all Hitchcock fans. It is a fine review af his most known films from the first British silent movies to America's Hollywood. This video is a long journey through the works of ""The maste of suspense"", and I enjoyed it very much! James Stewart, Sean Connery, Cary Grant, Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Ingrid Bergman and a lot of others famous moviestars through the years were all there on the night to celebrate Hitchcock... I can only recommend this historical video - buy it now!"
4,Good stuf,"When I first heard this album (uhhh....cd for ya'll under 40 years old)I didn't think it lived up to his earlier work. The problem, with me probably, is that Max Stalling is a true wordsmith. You have to listen to what he says. It's like reading certain books or Just like a good poem. You can't just skim over the pages. You have to pay attention. His work is like that with this album. Pay attention to what he has to say. I can't wait to buy his next album (errr....CD). Keep it up Max. I'll buy them all."
1,Overblown and nonsense,"Don't buy this cd. It is dramatic to the point of melodrama, and it's annoying. The performances are bordering on ridiculous because they are so over the top. The music isn't some of LaChiusa's best either. This is one that should just be quietly forgotten. It will make you tired to listen to it. The unending references to flying will grate on your nerves if nothing else will!"
3,Screenplay,"The book's instruction was fine, and the writer had great credential to pass on knowledge of how to write a screenplay. The book came in the condition expected, and I am happy with the overall service."
3,The new-used swap,"It's a little irksome when you order a new book and it's obviously used, but there was no writing in the margins or highlighting, and the pages were all there, so I suppose it's acceptable."
2,Not Impressed,Started reading this book but quickly put it away. I wasn't really impressed with it so much. I have better ones that are so much better and more impressive.
5,One of the best,"This is by far one of the best books on screenwriting that I own. Hauge is a skilled and experienced teacher and his methods are communicated clearly. I find that the book is a perfect blend between the over-technical school (Syd Field) and the ""just write it"" school (Lazarus, Viki King). Highly recommended."
5,How great is this book? I've bought five copies!,"If my house were burning, and I could only rescue ONE screenwriting book of the 60 that I own and (yes) have read, it would be Michael Hauge's ""Writing Screenplays That Sell.""While it is terrific for the beginner, I had already written three scripts before reading this book, but the advice and guidance in this book focused me so well that I now judge my writing experience as ""pre-Hauge,"" and ""post-Hauge."" Post-Hauge, I have had five scripts reach Semi-Final stage in the Nicholl Fellowship, and three have been optioned.I have also bought this book as gifts for five friends, including my son, who said that they wanted to learn how to write a feature script.You won't go wrong following the advice in this book."
3,"Helpful, insider knowledge and an interesting read",Has some interesting insider knowledge. I would recommend it for someone seriously interested into getting into the business of screenwriting or someone just looking for an interesting book to pick up and read. I have no complaints.
4,Really Good. A fun and informative Read.,"I really enjoyed reading this book and used it to assist the writing of my first screenplay. I have given the book Four stars in my review - it would have been Five but I just finished reading the Gotham Writers' Workshop book Writing Movies and in terms of information delivered and readability I have to reserve my Fives Stars for that. Sorry Mike - but I did love your book all the same. Just to provide some context for my review, I give Syd Field's Art of Screenwriting book three stars because although it has lots of great information in it also, it is a little out of date and it reads like the old-school style text-book it is - very dry."
1,What a mistake buying this book,I wasted my money buying this book. Many other books out there on the same subject are far more informative and easier to read than this one.
5,excellent quality dog food!,"i have 3 senior dogs who are very fussy eaters that have refused to eat any can foods that i have bought at the store. a friend told me about canidae, i took a chance and tried it, and my dogs loved it! they have gained weight, which they needed, and are acting much more youthful, i will keep buying the food for them! the ingredients are very nutritional, and are much better then anything i can find at the local stores!"
1,Major disappointment,What a shame. A 30 CD set with nothing new! RCA just put 30 cds in a box! They are not even the 30 best! It looks like they were just randomly selected. Shame on you RCA!
1,"RCA RETURNS TO ""CAMDEN"" MENTALITY","Remember the day in 1972 when you rushed out to buy ""Burning Love?"" Elvis ROCKED with a vengeance!!! And then RCA THOUGHT they were doing music lovers a favor by issuing it on a budget Camden album call ""Burning Love And Hits From His Movies."" Oh, THE HORROR!!! Just when youngsters were thinking ""hey, this guy really ROCKS!"", RCA (or Colonel Parker...take your pick) actually manages to brainwash America with ""I Love Only One Girl"" ( a really PUTRID song from the film ""Double Trouble.""). So what's my point??? This new release called ""THE COLLECTION"" is actually a ""Camden"" boxed set in disguise."
2,Could be better,"It is a nice set, but there are cd's that they could have included instead of the repeats that they did, 6 cd's are just pure repeats of what is already there."
1,The worst box set ever put out by RCA!!!,"How could they have put together such a horrible box set??? Don't waste your money whatever you do!!! This so-called 30 CD box iset is simply a waste!!! The music is nothing new!!! RCA, like that other review said below, wake up and get with it!!! Elvis's Classic 1956 albums is missing from this box set and it doesn't even contain his double feature sound track albums!!! What a crying shame!!! Do not even consider buying this! There are way more superb Elvis material available out there, but no way is this set going to be the one for you!!! Forget it!"
3,The jury is still out ...,I tried this on my Thanksgiving turkey and they didn't work. The loop came undone during cooking. It was also a bit difficult to deal with using greasy hands. Maybe it will do better on stuff that roasts flat in a pan.
1,Not so good,I bought these a few years ago. They were definitely unimpressive. I'm surprised they are still being sold!! I can't recommend these to anyone!!
3,Mobile Base,Adequate performance for a reasonable price. Assembly is simple and fast. raising the stand up under load is a bit awkward but it does the job. Use with tools that vibrate may incease the vibration. Nothing special. If you're a woodworker you can build your own mobile bases for about the same price.
4,Mobile Base,I had bought two mobile bases from a Sears Hardware outlet for ... dollars a pc.. After reading your reviews I thought I would chance buying a couple of bases from you. You can only imagine my suprise when I opened the box to find the exact same mobile bases which I just paid ... dollars more for. Good job Amazon.com. The bases are a good value and really have made working in my limited space shop a dream. They handle the weight of my tools with no problem and are plenty stable.
5,Universal Mobile Tool Base,"I have recently purchased this item and have only great things to say about it and the service I received from the supplier!The unit is actually a lot better than advertised! Novel concept!I am using this base under a full size band saw that weighs 190lbs.I will order at least two more of these load carriers for other tools in my Guitar shop.I highly recomend this for any one that wants to have their tools where they can be moved around in the shop! Great floor space advantage, and back saver!"
2,Flimsy & cheap plastic foot pegs,"I would recommend going with a heavier-built base. I bought one of these for a 14"" bandsaw. It took an hour to assemble and the plastic foot pegs broke when setting the brake. Very frustrating, not worth even the low price paid for it. Do yourself a favor and spend a bit more on a more heavily constructed mobile base."
5,Engineering Tech,"We are using this universal mobile base to make our table saw mobile. It works great for stashing it out of the way, then moving it to the desired location for use. We simply adjusted the size and positioned the saw on the base and were ready to roll!"
2,shop guy,"I ordered the HTC 2000 for my 17"" drill press. It seemed to me to be too light weight - the rails were very thin flat steel with a slight roll on the edge for stiffness I suppose. The casters were also light duty. When I say light duty I am comparing it to the Grizzly/Shop Fox 7314. It is a much stronger unit, heavier casters and boxed rails. I own 4 of them and can say they do their job. I ordered the HTC as a cost saving measure. It is $59 vs $69 for the Griz. The Grizzly is actually $20 more since no super saver shipping, but worth the extra. More heft for the buck. I just returned the HTC and ordered a Grizzly 7314 in it's stead. I should have stuck with what works."
3,HTC HTC2000 Universal Mobile Base Review,"This is the third mobile base that I have purchased and it is the first one from HTC. My other two units are the Delta mobile base in which you must provide the hardwood cross members into their provided corners. These two units support my Jet Contractors saw and my Jet 14"" CS Band Saw. The HTC unit is for my Jet 6"" CS Jointer. Overall the unit assembled easily and holds the Jointer very well. My biggest complaint with the unit is that it does not provide the movement flexibility that my other units do. I have a small workshop and need to swing the units around easily. The Delta base has a single wheel centered on one side of the frame and it can pivot very easily. The HTC unit with its two pivot wheel design does not permit easy movement. As I continue to expand my workshop I would not purchase this style again with the two wheels."
3,A decent lightweight for the price -->,"It is a little flimsy compared to my Shop Fox mobile base. Although this one costs [much] less, so it's not a fair comparison really. If you have the money, opt for the HTC that is designed for your saw or whatever.The thing I don't like about this one is that since the wheels are elevated one at a time and the frame is made of flat stock it twists a little as you raise your machine. If you don't have your open stand equipment super tight, it will knock the legs out of level. Nothing dangerous or big, just a little disconcerting.If you just can't bear to spend the extra money, this is a good choice. Just remember the weight limit. (300 lb.)"
2,It broke,"My hubby ordered two of them. The one he used for the bandsaw broke at the plastic flap that locks the wheels:( and it was after 2 weeks we installed it. The other one is still doing okay, and he used that for a drill press which normally doesn't go anywhere. Will not recommend."
4,Good for light-medium duty uses,"This is a decent mobile base for light-medium weight uses.I use one on an older Jet 12"" bandsaw and it seems to be rightat its limit. The other one I use on a router table and it isjust right.Would I use this on my heavy contractor table saw?-no. But forlighter use it is just fine. I have other HTC products whichwere built for dedicated (vs. general) use and they are muchheavier and built like Sherman tanks. The relatively small difference in price buys a lot more mobile base!Good value for the money, just don't totally believe the ratingthat HTC gives it! Anything over 150 lbs weight, in my opinion,is too much for it."
1,Rock 'N Roll,"Big, big mistake. Bought this Universal mobile base for my new jointer- planer. It does not provide a level platform and shimming level a motorized piece of heavy equipment is never a good idea. The item is too light weight even if it didnt rock and roll. Wasted my money trying to go cheap."
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"I couldn't pass up a 1HP 4-speed 14"" HF bandsaw for a little over $200 on sale. I realized the need for mobility of this tool in my shop and looked for reasonably priced mobile stands. The HTC2000 is rated for much more weight than I needed and would accomodate a larger base of another tool if it didn't work out for the bandsaw.No problem - just one 14"" brace front and back and one 18"" each side made the stand fit perfectly. It takes a few minutes to put all the nuts and bolts in but the metal is strong and the wheels roll smoothly. When the base is not elevated for moving, there are rubber feet that keep the base steady. The two swivel casters have one step lever each instead of one center lever for raising. I don't see a problem with using it on a closed base bandsaw; the low mounted motor weight is more than the higher weight. I think the base is made well and does what it is supposed to do."
4,Good support; not the greatest value,"I like how this thing goes together and how it works. However, two things bother me about it: (1) It moves when the wheels are up. It needs chocks or something to keep it stationary under the table saw for ripping sheet goods and other heavy work like ripping thick stock; and (2) it doesn't seem like $+ is a great value to me like so many others have raved. I'm not cheap, but subjectively, this is not a bargain unless you are strictly comparing it to what it sells for elsewhere. Overall I still rate this a 4 because it's quite strong (mine is ably supporting a 300-lb table saw), it is easy to use and install, and is well-made. I would buy another one (or three!) but I'd like to find it for a better price--like $."
3,Good Stand,"It was a good stand for the money I guess... when you compare it to the price of the other stands. I think you could make your own for less though. Looks like all they did was get some pieces of metel, bolts and a few casters and then sell it to you for %100 profit, if not more. Construction was easy, just time consuming. Leveling your work piece is even more time consuming. Good luck doing that... It took me hours of moving the table saw on to it, then off of it, then back on, and back off just to find that I would never quite get it level."
4,nice product and great value,"Just received my htc 2000 mobile base.Arrived in less than one week in good condition.(Shipped FED EX).All the pcs. were there but the assembly instructions were missing.I called amazon and they contacted the manufacturer.A new set of instructions arrived in three days,however these were written in spanish.Luckily the diagrams are clear enough to use. Assembly was straight forward and took 45 minutes. Mine is under a Craftsman stationary saw,rolls very nice and sits level.I would have given this five stars if not for the missing directions. Also, HTC Corporation needs to get a website."
5,Excellent value and well built,"I purchased one of these from my local Rockler store ($55 with current discount). I am usually pretty wary of products that come in cheap looking packaging and as a mechanical engineer I am pretty picky. As soon as I got this out of the box I was impressed with the sturdy frame material and overall construction. Took about 10 mins to put together, had someone help me lift my Jointer onto it and I was done. For the money this is a great product and I plan to buy 2 more this weekend.If I was to change anything I would probably want slotted holes all around (just the long rails have these) and it would allow for a slightly better fit to the base although the fit is already pretty good.HTC HTC2000 Universal Mobile Base"
1,Too small for a normal size table saw.,"Come on guys. I have a standard size Dewalt table saw (Model DW744) with a 10"" blade. It is on a Dewalt stand (model DW7440 type 2) which has a foot print of 26 1/2"" X 37"" and your mobile base is too small to fit it. Also the instructions and diagram are pretty bad, not user friendly at all. The diagram needs to be bigger and clearer if nothing else. And would it have killed you to separate the parts in individual bags with the sizes marked on them to make it easier?Fortunately for me I had some extra frame parts from one of your earlier models many years ago when the locking levers where metal, not plastic like now and with the help of my bench grinder was able to modify them to expand the mobile base to actually fit the saw. You can do better than this!One final thing, advertisements for this item should have a couple of fields (blocks) on the screen where you enter the width and length of your stand and it comes back and tells you if it would fit or not."
4,Good way to move things around,Love it. Price is ok. I got one for my new router table and it was such an improvement over the one I had for my table saw that i ordered a second one to replace the one i have for my table saw.
3,not sturdy enough,"Using with Jet contractor saw. Fine if mobile just means pushing it around on a smooth, flat, sturdy floor. It bent all to crap when moving the saw off the moving truck during a move. Beat it back into usable shape which was OK. Leveling feet don't lock in place. This thing always struck me as cheap, barely adequate junk even before I bent it. You can DIY a better base for the same $$ or less."
4,universal mobile base htc htc2000,product was packed well - received in good condition - all parts were in package - good quality construction. instructions drawing not clear enough. need better image. larry
4,Nice mobile base for the $$$,"I have two of these. One is under my Delta Bandsaw the other under my Ridgid 6"" Jointer. Both are well suited for the task. You have to be careful with the jointer as it has a narrow base though."
4,The way things used to be made,"This is a great example of getting better execution because the cost of mfg is lower elsewhere (China). You get some serious weight steel channels, nicely welded and painted. Some assembly required. But pretty straight forward. One drawback is that when disenaging the casters, depending on their rotational orientation, the frame lowers onto the caster roller itself and thereby suspends the frame from the floor, preventing the sticky feet from touching. So, you have to twist or kick the rollers to the right orientation to get the stationary feet onto the floor"
5,Shop Safety,This base was easy to assemble and is very stable under my band saw.It rolls easily and smoothly. Also very solid in parked position.
3,Poor Quality,"I received the HTC2000 base and noted that it was packaged very well. Upon assembly of the base I found that one of the leveling legs was impossible to assemble to the corner bracket because the threads in the plate were not cut completely through the plate. I had to go the a local shop, borrow the appropriate tap and cut threads in order to assemble the foot to the corner bracket. Now that it is assembled it works as advertised. After my experience I doubt that I would purchase the HTC2000 Universal Mobile Base again."
4,HTC2000 Price Increase,"July 13, 2004 I bought a HTC2000 at $43.00 from Amazon.com. July 17, 2004 (3 days later) Amazon.com increased the price by (28.3%) ($16.99) to $59.99 each. Ouch! The price increase of steel did not jump that high."
1,HTC 2000 Mobile Base,The plastic foot levers are not strong enough to handle a load. It broke with hand pressure while makeing final adjusts during initial setup.
3,"OK, but .......I prefer the Delta 50-345","Bought this for my Jet 14"" bandsaw. Assembled easily, but having TWO independantly raised casters makes it wobbly when raising/lowering the unit. I also bought the Delta 50-345 mobile base and prefer that to the HTC model. The Delta model has a SINGLE foot lever to raise the unit- much easier and convenient than the HTC. Only detractor with the Delta is you have to supply the wood for the frame. Bottom line- the HTC moible base is OK, but Delta 50-345 is better buy for the money."
2,Not a quality base,Bought it for my Dewalt Table saw. It worked well for about one year then the orange foot releases broke. They are made of plastic. Now it hobbles along.
1,foot levers break,"I purchaed this mobile base with my new jet band saw. The saw weighs approximately 250 lbs, well within the weight rating. The unit was easy to assemble but the orange foot levers broke on the first use. The only way I can activate the rollers without breaking the levers is to manually rock the saw backwards while stepping on the lever. They should have been metal. I haven't contacted the manufacturer yet but plan to. Unfortunately I purchased two of these units."
1,Manual needs a lot of work,"HTC HTC2000 Universal Mobile BaseAfter I received the base kit from Amazon and started to assemble it, I found two missing nuts. According o the manual they were 3/8-16. After picking up two from the local hardware store, they did not fit. I also noticed that not all of my American Standard wrenches would not fit. I called HTC Products, Inc. and discovered that they now have the base manufactured in Asia and metric threads are now used. They said they are working on the manual.My god, just how hard is it to insert a loose sheet that informs us that the nine American Standard fasteners are now metric?To their credit, they did send the two correct nuts.Bill"
5,"Good Value, Very Effective","I got two of these, one for my Delta radial arm saw, and another for my jointer. It goes together quickly, though the instructions could have been a bit more clear. Once the tool is mounted on the base, it moves easily, levels nicely, and sits securely while in use. Definitely a winner!"
2,Time simply to valuable!!,"Well, I just got thru assembling the HTC 3000and it took over four hours. Lousy instructionmanual, not clear at all on the sequence ofassembly; had to unbolt it a number of timesin order to get it to fit correctly becauseof the way the wheels have to be bolted on.The next one, IF there is a NEXT one, shouldbe a lot easier to assemble since I now knowwhat to allow for in advance. I can say thishowever,it does appear to do the job quite welland with the free S&H; and ESPECIALLY it beingMADE IN THE USA !!!!!!! Kudos for that HTC !!"
1,Stupid design,It's hard to believe anyone would purposely design a product like this. Only two of the casters will swivel - try moving anything that way - it's a royal pain. And try to get it level - another pain.I decided to build my own - just a simple platform with a lip to keep the machine on it and 4 swivel casters with brakes. Can be made in a couple hours.
4,HTC2000 Universal Mobile Base,"I ordered the universal mobile base for a large band saw that I recently purchased. It was a little tricky to assemble because the directions were not very clear, and some of the screws had been substituted so I was not certain that all the parts were included until I was well into the assembly. Everything seems to be in metric units now so that adds to the confusion regarding screw sizes, etc. Once I got it assembled I needed some help dropping the heavy band saw into the base, but so far it works well and seems to be pretty stable. As others have alluded to, the plastic levers don't seem like they would be sturdy enough to leverage the base up when raising the wheels, so I won't know for awhile how durable they are. Overall the product works as advertised and was sold at a good price."
4,Plastic vs Aluminum Levers,"Purchased the HTC 2000 mobile base for a floor sander which weighs about 200lbsThe original product shipped with plastic levers which are used to raise the equipment to engage the wheels.These broke and HTC replaced them with an aluminum version.The aluminum levers are smaller and a litter harder to raise the equipment to allow it to roll. But, hopefully will be stronger than the plastic ones.You can see both versions on the Amazon site. Look at the additional pictures to see the aluminum levers."
4,"Not bad. Add a plywood shelf to it, if you have the space.","This HTC mobile base was fairly easy to assemble and seems very stable supporting my new Delta DP300-L drill press with the Crawford PTS2 Tool Stand. (~90lbs.)I added 1/4"" lock-washers on the bolts to lessen any long-term vibration loosening concerns.The plastic paddle levers look quite strong, although I am tempted to order an extra set to be on the safe side. ;-)If you're using this base with a stand (like the PTS2), you'll see that the corner brackets can easily support a plywood shelf. I recommend measuring, cutting and drilling (if you prefer to fasten the shelf) for this after the assembly and just before loading your tool/stand on it. More fun that way than kneeling on a cold basement floor.Then, on top of the shelf I added another 3"" wide strip of plywood to the front of the base that provides a nice foot-rest when operating the drill press."
1,junk,"The package arrived without all the parts. I called the company and after several tries, they sent out the missing part. I put it together, placed my table saw on it that doesn't weigh anywhere near the stated 400# capacity, and the plastic levers snapped in two the first time I tried to lift it. Pure junk."
4,OK for the money.,"I paid $42 for these (each), and bought 4 sets. They are OK for the money. Decent quality, but the plastic lifting handle will probably break off some time soon."
5,Universal Mobile Bases,"I wasn't intending to buy this brand (had never heard of them), but after I received them (3 of 'em) and got them together, I'm glad that I did. They were much easier to assemble than previous bases that I've purchased and appear to be handling their load quite well. These bases were purchased to house a compound slide miter saw, a 6"" jointer, and a table top 13"" planner. It's so much easier gliding them around the shop on wheels as opposed to dragging them! I'd recommend you give them a shot... the quality is good and the price is right!"
3,Mobile Base,"I may have read the adjustment sizes wrong, but when I assembled the base it was not large enough to fit my jointer...fortunately I had some scrap metal laying around so I made it fit my jointer...other than that I think the product is good...easy to follow instructions...it may have been more me than the product"
5,Great product for a small home shop.,"I have a small home shop in my basement and needed to be able to store my machines against the wall and use them in the center of the room. Somewhere central so that I could feed 8' stock through them. These fit the bill perfectly. They were a great price, have excellent adjustability, and were very easy to assemble (especially the second time around). The only thing that would make this product better is if the wheel levers used to raise the wheels were tied together. As it is you have to push down two separate levers to raise the machine up, if there were only 1 lever that raised both wheels together it'd be perfect."
5,Five years and working great.,"I purchased two of these for my shop in 2005. They have seen lots of use and been reconfigured for multiple different tools. They are simple and work well. I even used angle iron to make one a bit bigger than OEM. They only have about 5/8"" ground clearance."
2,"Too flimsy, and difficult to follow assembly instructions","This base is rated for 400 pounds. I bought it for my 285 pound Jet JPS-10TS table saw, and it is not at all solid holding this saw. It ""bounces"" and flexes - I expect a mobile base, when the wheels are locked, to be as solid as when the tool is sitting directly on the floor. This is not even close.I also found that the assembly instructions were difficult to figure out. I'm an engineer, so I'm no dummy at putting things together - I feel the instructions could definitely be improved.Overall, I'm very disappointed."
2,Misleading Dimensions,"Don't buy this model if you plan on using it for your 36"" wide storage cabinet. The advertised 36"" maximum length is measured from the outside of the frame. The inside dimension is a bit over 35"". Your 36"" cabinet will not drop down inside. I had to build a wooden frame to sit ontop of the base which the cabinet sat on."
4,HTC2000 Mobile base,I have one under my jointer. It works great and is very easy to put together and use. Am getting another one for the table saw.
3,Not Sure I Like It,"Yes, it has the expected sturdy construction, but the foot levers to raise and lower are a little hard to operate. I have a jointer mounted on one and I find I have to assist in raising and lowering the machine as I operate the rather thin foot levers. And if i'm not careful, I can lower the machine down with a thud.In contrast to the Delta design, which I have my workbench mounted on, it is much easier to raise and lower with the single and larger foot pedal. Delta's design of a single caster also does seem easier to pivot with.5 stars for srurdy construction-2 stars for the hard to operate foor levers3 stars overallIf you need a mobile base that's ready to put together out of the box, the HTC2000 will serve your needs well enough. If you're able to make the rails yourself for the Delta model, or need a custon size as I did, I would go for the Delta 50-345 model instead since I find its design easier to use."
4,plastic handles,the only reason i don`t rate the item with five stars is the plastic handles. they should have a metal core in them. i have two of these units and will buy another this spring. one of my units i cannot use the handle as it just twists rather than rotate to unlock the wheels.
4,Good Value,"Worked well for my contractor saw- a bit of a pain to assemble, but that was to be expected given the universal nature of the stand."
2,Flimsy mobile base,"I have eleven heavy power tools on a variety of mobile bases. I ended up having to use this one for a relatively light parallel-arm scroll saw. It works OK, but certainly not strong enough for anything heavier."
4,An enjoyable first entry to a new detective series.,"Nathan Walpow has a winner with his Joe Portugal series. Set in contemporary L.A., the book provides an enjoyable view a group of succulent enthusiasts and the world they inhabit. Solving one major problem with many amateur detective mysteries, Mr. Walpow succeeds in providing his hero with a believable lifestyle that allows him time to search for a murderer - he's a totally-lacking-in-ambition actor in commercials living in a house owned, but not inhabited, by his father. In fact, the father and his friends are vibrant minor characters I look forward to learning more about in future titles. Congratulations to Nathan on a promising mystery debut!"
4,Quick review of math skills,"I teach 2nd grade and use these math journals on a weekly basis. I primarly use them as a homework assignment or as morning work. Each journal page has a few quick math problems (like addition, subtraction, number concepts, etc.), 1 word problem that the student has to work out in the space provided, and then a space at the bottom for the student to create their own math problem and answer it. I can really tell how much a student is processing their skills by the problems that they create at the bottom. The problems from this book are all related to skills my students must know, and the journal pages progress in difficulty. My only complaint is that the answers are on the bottom of each page, which means I either have to cut off the bottom strip or cover them up when I make the copies for the students. Overall, the journals are a quick review of key math skills and take the students approx. 5 min. to complete."
5,Steve Taylor at his best,"If you like Steve Taylor, you should like this album. If you don't know who Steve Taylor is, buy this and go watch Blue Like Jazz."
4,Bless This House,"Leslie Staub has written a creative nondenominational bedtime prayer book for young children. Its rhyming rhythm celebrates all that is near and dear to a child's heart, everything from its home, family, nature, and all God's creatures are seen from the open window of the child's bedroom. Children can always find something to be grateful about, and the simple text in the book helps all the young readers to make that feeling possible. The illustrations are done from the child's perspective of looking out the bedroom window. The author/illustrator uses bright oil colors to achieve keen sense of outdoors and Mother Earth."
1,Missing 2 pages.,"I bought this book as a replacement for the one my daughter has read so many times it is falling apart. Unfortunately, this replacement was missing 2 whole pages! So, we are still reading her old one, which is torn and beat up, but at least has all the pages."
4,my 5 year old loves this!,"My 5 year old and 3 year old are always fighting over the swing on the swing set. when I bought this and hung it in the tree. my 5 year old loved the idea of ""swinging from a tree"" and I feel safe with her on it. just make sure the branch is strong enough to take the weight and motion of the swing"
2,Sit and slide,"I bought this for our two kids 3 and 4 (""Recommended Age Range 3 to 10 years""), but my kids complain it is hard to stay seated, they slide off rather often and have hung the swing and not used it after the first day... It would have been nice if the seat area was less smooth and more rough to prevent sliding off the very smooth plastic seat."
3,Not for a three year old,"My three year old enjoys but it requires an adult to mount the child, push the swing and keep it in motion. This toy does not invite a kid to just ""hang out"" in the backyard. Maybe, when my son is older, he can figure out how to mount and propel it. Since weight limit is 100lbs. I cannot test its functionality myself."
3,"Decent, but small","The disc seat is not as big as I had thought it would be. It is difficult for the kids to stay on while swinging. They do enjoy playing on it, but it would be much better if they didn't constantly fall off due to the limited space for them to sit. (Maybe it is intended for smaller children..mine are 5, 6, and 8 years old.)"
5,Makes Great Tree Swing.,"My 5 yr old loves this swing. I hung it on a maple tree, and she seems to like it better than her swing set. She liked it so much I bought a second one to put on a tree in the front yard.I like that this swing is made to easily attach to a tree and has a long rope (unlike the Step 2 disc swing). I did have to adjust it once to get it high enough off the ground so the bottom did not scrape. I don't know if the rope stretched after use or I just did not do it right the first time. Other than that, no problems. I cannot attest to its durability yet as we have had it only a month."
3,Little Tykes Swing,"All three of my kids loved this swing...that is until the rope frayed and broke. After less than one week of use. Really disappointed it wasn't more durable. My kids are all under age 11, so this should not have happened."
3,Disc Swing,"The sellers were great and it came on time. I just wish I would have looked around a little more, because later, I found the same toy at Toys 'R Us for a little cheaper, and I wouldn't have had to pay shipping and handling. The kids like the swing though."
1,No fun,"We have had this swing for about 2 years now, and it almost never gets used. My 5 year old never sits for more than 3 minutes on this thing, and usually complains that it hurts. If its too low her feet hit the ground. If its too high she slips off while trying to get onto it. I thought swinging was supposed to be fun. This one isn't."
1,not for a tree swing,"12 foot rope is not long enough to go around the tree limb twice.Actually, it went around the limb once and the swing was three feet off the ground...little tikes customer service contacted and they were unable to provide a longer rope!"
5,Great Swing,We have had this swing in our tree for 4-5 years. The rope finally wore out and I am definitely replacing it. Of all the toys I have ever purchased this was the best one ever. My son swings in it nearly every day (all year round)and I know every child in my neighborhood as been on it at least once!!!!
5,Every child must have a swing,"Both of my children have grown up with this swing in our backyard. Tied to a strong tree, the kids will spend countless hours enjoying this classic disc swing. I am buying my third swing because I never have the heart to take the swing down from the tree when we move and my four year old wants her swing back. We have come to Amazon together and she is able to choose which swing she would like and this is the one she wants."
4,cheaper than you think:),"I purchased two of these swings for each of my kids. It has hung outside for about two years, surviving wind, rain, snow and my kids banging them into the trees, each other and anything else that gets in the way! They love them. When the rope finally wore out, I purchased new rope at Home Depot (very cheap). I took out the old rope and replaced it with new rope. The seats themselves seem virtually undestructible! My kids are back on them for the second year and next year I'm sure they will love them as much."
2,wouldn't buy again!,"This swing is too hard for little ones to be able to balance. It keeps tipping to one side or another when they are swinging, which makes it harder for them to hold on. I wouldn't recommend it for children under 5."
4,Everything I hoped for,"I got this swing this summer. My two boys are 3 and 6. At first they could barely hold on, but I held them or swung just a little until they got the hang of it. In a matter of a week their bodies learned to hold on and their core muscles got so much stronger. They swing as high as it will go now, laughing and yelling higher the whole time. It has given us hours of outside time together, friends have come over to swing, and it has taught them about taking turns as well as how to practice using their bodies to have fun and get stronger. We spliced it and used a piece of an old hose to go over the actual tree branch so the rope does not fray and wear against the branch. It will last for years."
5,Every1 LOVES it!,I bought this swing for my daughter & everyone loved it so much that I've bought 2 more to keep up with the demand. It's sturdy & comes with more than enough plastic rope.
4,Fun swing for kids,"My daughter enjoys this swing very much. It was easy to put up on an existing swingset, and she has enjoyed it very, very much since it went up. It was delivered quickly enough to get here before her birthday, even though it was sort of a last minute purchase. Highly recommended product."
4,good swing,"got this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it and her friends love to play too. SHe has a little trouble getting on, but she is only 5."
5,Just plain fun,"From the moment we hung this swing the whole family has been delighted. Our 5 year old son LOVES being swung back & forth and round & round. Adults giggle uncontrollably when they're pushed, trying to kick the nearby tree. The only drawback is the swing works a lot better when pushed rather than swinging yourself."
3,Disc Swing,"The disc swing works well, but needs plenty of clearance. I hung ours from a tree, but the swing can still reach the trunk creating a safety hazard."
5,This CD is incredibley creative and unique,"Don't let the name put you off. The music is truely exciting. I think anyone could appreciate some if not all of the tracks. There is a combination of blues, jazz, latin, and the Latin Playboy's own unique sound. It gets me dancing and singing everytime I listen."
2,Latin Playboys,"I assumed this cd would be more similar to Los Lobos, not so..., this cd was amaturish and immature. I definitely wouldn't have purchased it had I been given the opportunity to listen to the songs beforehand. Might appeal to some, but not me."
2,I should have passed,"Being a fan of Los Lobos I felt a nice side project could be wortha roll of the dice. Well, this one missed the mark and even though a few weeks old, I can't get it back in the rotation. The songs/tunes are just not developed for me. But hey if the radical departure was the outlet that artist was looking for, then I just did not connect.So if you are expecting the Los Lobos type rock feel, be advised...."
1,Don`t Play This,"A side project to Los Lobos, this uninteresting effort is somewhat experimental but equally dull, repetitive and forgettable. There are some latin vibes and atmospheres here, yet most aren`t too gripping or innovative and only make for a bland, unengaging and tepid listen. This record brings nothing new, it just seems a rehash of mexican movie scores. A couple of moments would sound nice in some ""Desperado"" or ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" scenes, but as a whole this offering isn`t convincing or appealing.A failed experience and a good one to avoid."
1,"Yawwn,where's los lobos when ya need em","I dont understand why anyone would say this is such a ""masterpiece"" of an album, I would say it is not much of an album at all, theres really only one great song on this collection of sleepy drowsy songs, and some are hardly songs at all just a jumble of sound effects, If i wanted to hear sound effects id buy an ocean sounds CD or something, I think David Hidalgo and his buddies were hanging out enjoying a little too much of the ""Green"" when they recorded this, there just isnt any bite on this album , its like listening to some kind of Depressing lo fi jazz album, sans the music, Cesar Rosas where are you? David Hidalgo needs you? hes depressed without you and the rest of the Lobos Gang, Dont buy this album unless you need something to put you to sleep."
5,This is the greatest thing ever by anyone in history,"Forget the Tragically Hip, The Guess Who, and Rush. Whale Music by The Rheostatics was named ""The Greatest Canadian Album of All Time"" on a CBC radio poll.Buy this album, and free yourself from the shackles of mainstream pop-rock. This album is brilliant, and is a great introduction to The Rheostatics. This is truly a band of musical geniuses, and anyone that prides themself on being open-minded, and listening to great music simply must buy it.This is my Can-Rock bible.Enjoy"
3,Unexpected discoveries in The Time Ships,"Interesting book. Different than I expected. I expected the time travel discoveries to be unexpected and even startling, but I never expected this."
4,"Great vision, but dry and not very engaging.","Like other scifi novels written by Stephen Baxter, this novel has great vision on the future of mankind and universe. The reader is taken across not only time, but also universes, so it's a wild ride indeed.However, this volume also lacks the aspects that makes a novel engaging and interesting, so if the reader is not looking for a grand vision, it would be a dry read."
3,Pretty good,"I thought it got a bit long-winded in the middle, and was a bit techy for a Dick winner, but in all, a clever, enjoying read."
1,The Time Ships...huh?,"I seem to be in a minority here, but here goes...I hated this book. I don't *care* that the science stood up to scrutiny, the narrative style was tedious and irritating, the plot was laborious, and the characterisation was shallow. Definitely not a hit for me."
1,I'm in the minority-but,"Other than the first few pages, I felt the whole story tracked off in a direction that H.G. Wells would not have taken..The whole Dyson sphere thing threw me and I found myself reading in hopes that things would ""get better."" The fact that the Time Traveler DID return to the very night he had planned (in ""The Time Machine"")seemed to derail Mr. Baxter's entire premise, that being, I assume, that it was impossible for the Time Traveler to return to his original point (time?) of departure.. In spite of my disappointment with the book, I read it twice..However, it did inspire me to finish my own attempt at a novel which is titled ""Epilogue: Time Machine Chronicles""..Perhaps I was expecting a more H.G. Wells type of story from ""Timeships"" and found it lacking in that respect..I didn't care for it but it seems I'm in the minority..."
1,WAY too long,"This would have made a nice, interesting 180 page book. Instead, Baxter wrote about 3 times that much, and boy is it dull. He must have been paid based on the number of words. At times, he goes on and on and ON about absolutely nothing. Then he seems suddenly to wake up and start trying to crank out some plot again. Agonizing. Manifold Space and Manifold Time are much better efforts."
1,Boring.,Couldn't force myself to finish this book. Gave up halfway through. Dull. No plot. No action. Not the least bit entertaining.
5,Tremendous and imaginative even for sci-fi.,"Baxter takes you on a voyage that you could not have dreamed about before this book. He takes you to the limits of human development, and then back to the beginnings of the world.The book is very detailed, and would be tedious for some readers. However, he tells a story that must be told in its entirety, and the detail is needed to set the plot."
5,Just one readers opinion,"This is one of the best books I've ever read in my life. I'm very much interested in science fiction books and time travelling and ""The Time Ships"" was in my opinion a very real conception of the time travelling theme. Baxter's way of describing it made me believe every word of it though I don't actually think that any person will ever be able to travel through time. I identified myself with the main character and enjoyed every moment of the adventure. For me Baxter is a genius who gave me a very interesting reading experience and much inspiration for my own literary purposes or studies about time (I'm working on one at the moment). H.G.Wells would have liked it! Thanks to Stephen Baxter for writing the book!"
3,More breath than breadth,"Not a terrible book. But not a terribly good one either.The language is a fair imitation of the original, and some of the book is brilliant. Unfortunately the last third of the book bogs down in the mire of philosophical speculation, physics mayhem, and general tedium.The attempt is to describe the transhuman, and it fails. The up side of this is that the reach of this book most certainly exceeds its grasp. There is much that is entertaining, and much fascinating, but the book ultimately fails in its final stages, failing to make a statement about humanity, the characters, the situation, the story, or anything at all."
4,Well worth the time to read,"H.G. Wells told his original time travel tale in just over a hundred pages. Baxter took nearly 600 pages to spin his sequel. This is the only complaint I have for Time Ships. The story is believable. The characters were believable, meaning they seemed the same as the first tale by Wells. A very good book but also very disturbing. I don't mean disturbing in a bad way as far as the book is concerned. It is one of those books that makes you consider your own mortality and insignificance. A truly worthwhile book."
2,By the end of the book I didn't care about the characters,"Interesting premise with a few fun points but the book becomes rather dull. The author spends way to much time on trying to explain the scientific principles behind the story. Plot and character development are sacrificed to technical muble-jumble. At the end of the book, I did not care about the people in the story.This story can turn someone off unless the reader loves to hear about science."
2,Oh Come On!,"No. If, ""The Time Machine,"" was going to be sequelled, someone else should have done it. I think he's done the protagonist a grave injustice by making him SO violent and thoughtless ALL the time. Beating Morlocks to death? REALLY? Then never seeing Nebogipfel as anything but the enemy and lashing out violently yet again? Then, as Moses, foolishly going out and getting killed? I guess it makes the ending (destroying the time machine, throwing away the greatness of humanity to save Weena) more believable, but he's become such an unlikeable character. I don't think he's suppose to be an anti-hero.No, I didn't like it."
1,Long winded!!,"Everyone raved about The Time Ships so I thought I'd better find out what the fuss was about. What a let down.600 pages of going from one end of the time continuum to the other, with not much happening in between. To be honest, I was bored, and when I got to the end I realised that I hadn't really been reading the last 100 pages or so.And how is it that a guy who invented time travel before Wilbur and Orville worked out how to get men even a couple a feet off the ground can be so thick?Perhaps Baxter is a genuius. Maybe I just don't like HG Wells, and Baxter just did him to a tee."
5,Old-time science fiction,"If you like ""modern"" (for lack of a better term) science fiction, which is often intensely psychological and character-driven, then Baxter is probably not for you. But if you also like Golden Age science fiction, full of mind-bending ideas and fascinating stories, then Baxter definitely is for you. Science fiction has not seen an imagination this audacious since Arthur C. Clarke. True, also like Clarke, Baxter's characters can be a bit thin at times. But since his novels often encompass the fate of entire races and the passage of millennia, there is no paucity of depth to the stories. (Interestingly, Baxter is also adept at micro-scale storytelling, such as his near-future solar system exploration novels.) Ring is just such a sweeping story, and it serves as proof that science fiction's golden age is far from over. If you have fond memories of Asimov and Clarke, Baxter will not disappoint you."
4,Tippmann Hopper,"good hopper. very lightweight. it rocks dudes and dudettes!! don't buy 4 high end guns. Best used on guns that have semi-auto. It is a bit of a battery drainer but uses a small battery, so you can carry an extra one in your pocket. it works very well. Buy insted of a gravity feed."
3,AL200 Loader,"This is ok, but I think a standard $5 loader would work just fine for me. I've only shot about 500 balls so far. It works good, but I don't like the noise it makes."
1,If I Could I Would Give It Less Than 1 Star,This is absolutely one of the most ridiculous books I have ever read. Some of the spells using the computer are just amazingly simplistic and most likely ineffective. I'm embarassed that I bought this book. If you want to get involved in Wicca then read some books by Scott Cunningham or Ray Buckland and learn real Wicca the way it should be.
1,Disappointing,"Faults:The Fanthorpes tend to drift off subject a lot and then back again rather confusingly, making reading their books difficult.They write about things that really are not part of the subject matter of the book. For example, in this book about sea mysteries, they include a chapter on the mysteries of Hawaii which are not mysteries of the sea but of the Hawaiian Islands.They include too much of themselves in their writings.The photographs are sometimes too dark, too small; too often one or both of the authors is in a photo."
3,"It does its job, mostly","This base does hold the saw and extension table fine. Set up was a snap. My only complaint is the swivel wheel. When locked, it will not roll, but is still can spin! An errant hip check or feed snag can produce a few inches of movement. The brake design of the roller wheels is good. Just make sure the swivel wheel really is secure."
5,A must-have for large table saws,This base is solid and easily moved. The brakes make it sit still as if it wasn't there. Best way to move a heavy saw. It allows me to roll the saw outside to enjoy the weather or keep it in the shop. Great accessory for my Delta/Beisemeyer saw. Don't go home without it.
2,Great If It Fits!,"This is a well designed and functional piece of equipment, but it doesn't fit the new (or at least not mine) Delta 36-982 contractor's saw. It is too narrow to fit the saw's legs (with or without the pads). BEWARE!Check with HTC's website for compatibility.I waited a while to place my saw on the base (had to disassemble it) which was when I discovered the incompatibility. This was also after I had thrown away the packing materials that the base came in.Amazon was very understanding, given the length of time after I bought the base and the fact that I threw away the packing materials. They were still going to take it back!!But,have welder, will travel.(I do) If you have a welder and the inclination, it is still a pretty good deal if you can catch it @ 20-25% off.As much HTC's fault as Amazon's, but Amazon's customer service saved the day (at least mine)."
4,Wusthof Steak Knive's,"Just purchaced these knives and love them. Strongly recommend,very sharp! I did think that they would be a bit heavier than they are but they are still wonderful knives!"
4,Wreslting book,Good book. Not as much wreslting moves as i had hoped but it has a lot of information from dan gables brillant mind. I think i am going to buy another book that has a few more moves but that doesnt take away from the quality of this book.
4,"Classic Gable, intense and to the point","Though not as detailed as I would have thought, Gable provides great insight on his vast wrestling experience. Included in this book are theories on: motivation, effective practice, evaluating ones own coaching, communicating with wrestlers, and wrestling philosophy. Gable stresses the importance of keeping the sport of wrestling fun and exciting- a necesary ingredient if the sport is to survive. The book can benefit the rookie middle school coach, all the way to the seasoned college coach. Besides the fact, anything Gable writes is a must read for any wrestling coach!"
1,One of the worst books I've ever tried to read,"Do not buy this book. It's truly dreadful. It seems like the author took a creative writing class (and failed), bought a thesaurus, and threw several thousand phrases together with as many adjectives and adverbs as possible. The prose does not flow at all: it's the same kind of feeling you get when you're being driven in a stick shift car with someone who's never driven one before.I couldn't get past page 21. I also bought a copy for a friend of mine (we're both Fracophiles and loved Peter Mayle--except his last book, which was terrible). She's more persistent than I am, and even she gave up.Save your money and look elsewhere.Mark"
1,Terrible Battery,The price is low but so is the ability to hold a charge. In my Kyocera camera I am not able to take more than 12 shots before it dies. The battery is only 6 months old
5,FRAM oil filter PH4967,I've used Fram Oil Filters for years. I use synthetic oil and this filter. I can drive extended miles before I need to change my oil when I use synthetic oil and this particular filter. Changing my oil isn't my favorite thing to do. But I feel confident in driving my car farther between oil changes when I use this filter.
5,Hard to Beat For The Price,"I have had this lens for almost a year and normally don't write reviews but the person who gave it four stars claims the pictures were great and focus fast and everyone agreed but gave it four stars? The lens deserves five stars for the price and flexibility. It does seem to work better on my 20d then on my 1Ds, the pictures are sharp and focus is fast for a zoom lens. Ihave all but two lens that are not Canon L lens, this one and the Sigma 150 macro and they are both fantastic lens. The lens is heavy."
5,Awesome!,"you cant beat this price for the kind of zoom you get, sure it's no f2.8, but a nikon similar would cost 6x's this and you can still get some great background blur with this lens. I like how light this lens is (lighter than my standard everyday nikon 2.8), i cant imagine how heavy a 2.8 zoom would be). I was a little worried when people said it can have slower auto focousing... but NO issues there, they seem to be comprable to the focousing speed of my nikon lens.VERY HAPPY!"
1,They must be kidding,"""I found this CD shrill. I was surprised so manypeople liked it. The singing was off key in placesand screamy. She was like a poor imitation of NatalieImbruglio."""
1,a weak entry,"Songs of JRB is an overly loud CD, the intention of which seems to have been to commercialize JRB's music. Mainstream might be a better word. In my opinion it's only an attempt and it fails. It's slick and smooth but there's nothing underneath. I enjoyed L5Y but have to add I'm glad I saw Sheri Rene Scott and not Lauren Kennedy after listening to these stridenly performed songs."
5,READ THIS REVIEW,"While scrolling through numerous reviews of this album, I found some that I so strongly disagreed with, I felt compelled to write an accurate review of this album. Jason Robert Brown and Lauren Kennedy have put together a simply magnificent album. I read two or three people (out of thirty, mind you) say that Lauren Kennedy had no connection to the lyrics. That could not be a more inaccurate description of her performance. I am literally hypnotized by her outstanding ability to convey her emotions so strongly in these songs - particularly ""Letting You Go."" She is incredibly taleneted. This album is a must have for people who are Jason Robert Brown fans. Lauren Kennedy was the PERFECT choice for this album. She was phenominal in every song she did. She was able to sing with versatility that so many singers lack. Is it my favorite Jason Robert Brown album? No - but how can you beat Songs for a New World? Get this CD - it is worth the investment!"
4,Upon Closer Inspection...,"I recieved this CD for Christmas last year, listened to it once, and promptly went back to my ""The Last 5 Years"" CD. It didn't really grab me at the time. I recently put it back in the car CD player on my way to work and fell in love with it. This last year I have gotten to know JRB's music better and really appreciate the way he can capture emotion in his music. He doesn't indicate or hit you over the head with it, but expresses it simply. Although Ms. Kennedy is not my favorite singer, she conveys the emotions of JRB's songs as they were meant. I believe this is particularly true in ""Letting You Go"" & ""If I Told You Now"" where she can capture the devastation of loss and the pain of constant self-doubt respectively without over-emoting. Simple and beautiful... that sums up this CD."
1,Jason Robert Brown Deserves More,"I like Jason Robert Brown's music and after seeing ""The Last 5 Years,"" I bought all three of his show albums. I've very glad that Lauren Kennedy did not make the New York show. I don't like her voice or her expression of a song. Jason Robert Brown will, I hope, go on to do better things than he has and I hope better singers may realize his songs in new ways."
3,Still Worth Buying,"Besides having the ugliest CD design I've seen in a while, this disc suffers from an unprofessional mix. Namely, the piano is way too loud to allow the listener to enjoy any of the music. Nonetheless, the vocal performances seem right on target with JRB's songs - emotional kiddie-coasters. I was impressed by his performance in ""I'd Give it All For You."" His interpretation gives clout to the idea that composers have a distinct advantage when performing their own songs."
1,not very good,"I was a little mystified as to why my original review of this rather poor CD was cut. I think Jason Robert Brown is extremely talented and normally I enjoy his music - I loved Parade - but the orchestrations and arrangement and performances on this CD were not impressive. I hope to see Mr. Brown's work once again on Broadway or off-Broadway, I do think he's a wonderful composer, but I missed the ""musical"" in this musical theater composer's work this time around."
1,not up to the standards of PS Classics,"This is a somewhat brash entry from PS Classics and a real letdown after the gorgeous Christine Andreas CD. It seems to be an amalgam of musical theater, rock and popular music but is not a good representation of any of the above, either in vocals or composition."
3,not bad book; it's just impossible to teach how to write,"Before I sank my teeth into this ""How To"" guide I was already not in agreement with the book. This prior disagreement sprang from the fact that I, myself a writer, believe 100% that true poetry comes from within, which completely negates the entire purpose for writing this book. I must admit that when I finished the ""guide"" I was pleased with Mr. Kirby's, albeit futile, attempts; there are some things one can glean from this work..."
1,terrible incorrect double billing,"The product was ok. I WAS DOUBLED BILLED. My c/c changed last 4 digits.They kept asking me to try again, and I was doubled billed, with extra book. If I send book back and mark REFUSED, will my accoount be credited."
5,Fiction,"I don't read fiction very often, but this book captured my attention years ago. I am still amazed this book was never picked up for movie rights. What a story!"
3,Good! But not her best,"I found this book very interesting at the beginning, which was full mystery, romance, tragedies and revenge. But towards the end the story line became a bit boring"
3,Another shunned daughter makes good story,"I read this book because it was on the list for my church-based bookgroup. Usually they pick a book with some faith/spirit-theme/plot. I could see how this book made it, the characters overcome adversity to make something of themselves. It reminded me a little of ""Wild Swans"" a book about a chinese daughter who is ill-treated by her father yet overcomes this to live a good life.This book has an interesting setting, in the West during the gold rush, and ties in characters from China as well as England. It has an interesting twist in the end. The story is a little predictable but inspiring and has a novel twist in the end. I recommend it for those who like historical fiction/romance."
4,FORTUNE IS A WOMAN,Fortune is a Woman--very interesting and intriguing read. The novel is full of surprises. It's a story with a mystery.
3,enlightening,"This book holds your interest--especially the insights into chinese culture and family structure. The San Fransico family is written a bit unrealistically. Although it is not a page turner"" it is a good read and certainly kept my intrest."
2,Same Old...Same Old,Very predictable. Anyone who was tortured as much as the main character would have been dead long before she had a chance to become rich and famous.
3,Pretty good.,"Both musically and lyrically, this album is nicely varied without going too far (so that some tracks must be skipped). There's little more to call it than decent, overlooked alt. rock. Why is this an import?"
5,really good music,"My long lost friend Allison played one of Swell's CDs for me in 88 or so. I liked the band right away and continue to listen to them. I hope they get the recognition they deserve, and continue making music."
4,PACHANGA!!!!!!,"King Africa absolutely rocks the hispanic booty with his latest installment, Pachanga! This CD combines the best elements of House, Hip-Hop, Salsa, and a slew of other latino styles, into a far out rump shakin ASSault. Even if you despise dance music, this CD will have something for you. The King's vocals are the punchiest since any Fatboy Slim chorus. The bass is deep and melodic. Best of all it is completely 100% Spanish. Pick it up, get drunk, a make a fool of yourself. It rocks."
4,A SLEEPER,"Wow, what a party whopper.. Whether you're Spanish or not, those few tracks'd clean out your gills. These Argentine fellas have their musical heritage and satire under control, giving you all the good-time possible. Keep and open mind, if you like George Zamphir and the bass drum, you'll be O.K., otherwise resort to a wild dancing to numb your already numb skull."
5,Made in the USA Great upgrade fence for my Ridgid granite top saw,"I have been researching fences forever and finally decided on the Vega Pro 40. I noticed some reviews complaining about rough edges and scratchs and bad packing. I did not have any of this. It was packed very well. I choose not to drill and tap any new holes, so I did loose 8 inches to the right. The front rail is heavy duty and solid. On the Ridgid saw I used the far left and the far right holes to mount the brackets for the front rail. The rear rail required some drilling to line it up. I used the align it to line up the fence with the blade. It did take awhile to tighten the fence and get it square. I have used it a couple of times and it works great. Will update again when I do more work with it."
5,Vega table saw fence,"The Vega fence came as ordered, in a very heavy box. It arrived in a timely fashion and was confusing to install. I figured more out by looking at the complete picture on the instructions than by using any other method. This weakness was identified by others who had purchased this same item.It is a quality addition to my table saw and cost more than the saw did originally. Got what I expected and I am looking forward to many projects using this new table saw fence."
4,Easy does it...,"Bought this fence as replacement for Incra TS fence. Incra worked well, unless cutting required a lot of force against the fence, then, it tended to ""tilt"" unless you lock down both sides--an inconvenience. Anyway, the Vega was very easily installed on my Grizzly contractor's saw. Bolt locations matched my tabletop's existing holes, rails installed in minutes. Only 1 minor glitch, the outboard side of the fence would ride too high above the table top. A trip to the sander and the plastic button was easily downsized.Overall, the fence seems solid and dependable, not as smooth to operate as the Incra, and certainly not as repositionable, but I don't have much need for the repeatablility the Incra gives. I want the solid operation the Vega provides. I'm pleased with my purchase and recommend this fence."
4,Vega Pro 40,"Just pulled the fence from the box. Well packaged, all parts present. Very impressed. One problem - The instruction suck. In fact, they more than suck - they are pathetic. Tried to locate instructions online. No luck. Other than that, the product is perfect."
5,Excellent Investment,"I reviewed this on several woodworking forums before making a purchase. This system is every bit as good as any on the market and with free shipping it is the best buy. I have a newer model Craftsman ""hybrid"" saw and the only change for installation was the purchase of bolts to fit the holes to attach the back rail. Installation was easy and complete in 30 minutes. Directions for installation and setup were clear and concise. The micro adjuster is icing on the cake. You will not be disappointed with this fence system. It is well made and accurate. I cannot believe what a difference it made."
5,Definitely worth the money,"I researched online for about 2 hours looking at various different fence systems out there and the Vega fence system was the cheapest and was the only one I could find that claimed to be universal across the most common brands. I purchased the Vega Pro 40 for my Craftsman table saw (approx 25 years old). When I received the Vega pro I noticed there were no instructions provided on how to install which was the only downfall. Once I looked at all the parts and then looked at my table saw everything became clear on how to install it. The install only took about an hour and I did have to drill 1 hole into the back side of my table saw (was no big deal). Everything went together perfectly. The fence lined up almost perfectly, adjusted it (took about 2 min) and it was ready for use. The only advice I have is wipe down the tube with some silicone spray and it will glide with ease. I am even thinking about buying another one for my dad who has the same table saw."
5,the best,this is in my opinion on one of the best table saw rip fences i have ever used. i put the fence on my delta contractor saw and it fit perfect. there was know problem at all. after i put it on i played around with it awhile and loved it. i took my time and fine tuned it and it worked perfect in every way. buy it you will not be sorry! i will not have know problem telling my friends about how good it is. oh yes buying from amazon was good. i order it on thruday and got it on saturday. good people to deal with.
1,Not good enough,"Before buying this item I read a lot of reviews. Those reviews and the fact that it looks solid and easy to use, convinced me to buy it. What a mistake I made. With the exception of the fence itself, and the front rail, the manufacturing of the head assembly, which is void of any quality control at all, renders the whole item a joke. I can not recommend this item, especially when there is so many others out there to choose from. I was able to modify the head assembly and invent and make two items to go with it that makes it usable. I have many suggestions to the manufacturer, one that would make it much cheaper for some to buy, but they are not interested in any outside help. The factory did send me a new unpainted head assembly as I requested but it only solved some of problems. Without the accessories that I made I would not be able to use this item at all, and would have returned it."
1,Delta unifence - MUCH BETTER!!!!,I bought the Vega PRO 40I installed itI uninstalled itI returned itI bought the Delta UNIFENCE U30Will never look back - nor will you.
3,Vega table saw fence,"The Vega rails and fence were good quality in terms of materials and workmanship. I was disappointed in the quality of the mounting hardware. The aluminum mounting brackets were punched out not machined. Very poor quality, I called the company and they promply sent me new brackets. The quality was slightly better, still stamped out. The remaining hardware had raw edges and was raw unpainted metal. I cleaned it up and painted the hardware to prevent rust. The quality did not live up to the description on the Vega web site. It will work fine. Had I known this, I would have spent the money on a Biesemeyer fence."
1,Pretty Much Useless!,"In theory this should be an extremely accurate fence. Unfortunately, when you position the fence and engage either the main or micro adjustment locks, the fence and head rotate about and squareness is lost. If you set the squareness with the lock(s) engaged it rotates in one direction. If you set it with them unlocked, it rotates in the other. And, in either case, it throws the set dimension off at the blade by about 1/32 inch. Unfortunately, there are no adjustment mechanisms as there are on the Unifence and others to correct this. I'm a pro that needs real precision that the micro adjust should provide.But, if I can't come up with a fix, as a precision tool the Vega fence is ""PRETTY MUCH USELESS!"""
4,im a big judy blume reader........,This is not one of Judy Blumes's best books but its still great to read! its a book about a boy who starts to have some problems and well.....why don't u read it and find out?¿? i would also check out some of Judy Blumes other books while your at it!
3,Disappointed but Well-Liked,"I-reading all of Judy Blume's books-was rather disappointed with Then Again, Maybe I Wont. Maybe it's because I am a girl and it's coming from a boy's point of veiw...I really am not sure...but it other than that it was good. Some parts were unrealistic. Why would a fifth(going in to sixth) grader(the narrator and main charecter) watch a girl get undressed from his window??? Once again, maybe I don't understand the thrill...it just seems like something an older boy[maybe eighth grader) would do......anyways NOT recommended to anyone under the age of 12-the book talks about some mature things..."
2,judy blume book,"Well, I ordered the book thinking it was the exact one in the picture...that is the one I wanted. But the one that came, while it is the same story, the cover is one of the more recent editions...boo on that."
3,Still a fan of Judy Blume though,"I am a fan of all Judy's books, but this one stunk badly. Your father getting rich from an invention? Knows about your friend and what he does but still hangs around him? Watching his friend's sister Lisa undress? Come on. I thought that reading a book from a boy's point of view was interesting. I think you should stick to stories from a girl's point of view like Are you There god? its me margaret ( also by Judy Blume)"
2,Rather worthless use of time,"I found the book rather worthless with its story line about an uninteresting boy who is a pervert. The writing is predictable, the story is slow and prosaic. An hour of my life wasted."
4,"Just like ""Are You There God?"" for boys","As a fast read, this book is great. Boys twelve and thirteen can easily relate to Tony. Well, sort of. I live in the city, but that's just me. Anyway, the only problem I had was that is was too short. Better charachter development and possibly a more structured plot could have done the trick, but still a classic."
4,Nicely written.,"There are hundreds of stories about coming of age. But most are told in the female perspective. Judy Blume's Then Again, Maybe I won't, is written in the male perspective. This is a nice changein young adult literature. Tony is a typical boy who lives in a suburb and his life is pretty normal. That is until his father invents some type of electrical circuit which gets his family extremely rich. Tony and his family move to a rich, classy neighborhood. There, he realizes how money changes people. He also makes a friend who has a terrible shoplifting habit. Should Tony tell someone? Tony also is growing up. The one flaw to the story was the ending. But, as far as YA fiction goes, it is well-done."
5,Excellent book for adolescent teens.,"I read this book by chance in my junior-high school reading class, and never forgot it. Now that I am revisiting it years later, I feel as though I am the child in the story. His emotions relate to my childhood feelings in so many ways, I can hardly believe it myself."
5,"""The funny, touching story of a boy with problems.""","After moving to Long Island, New York, from Jersey City, 13-year-old Tony Miglione tries to cope with a new life--new friends (like shoplifting Joel), new feelings (like for Joel's older sister, who un/dresses in front of her window, thus explaining the binocular cover), and virtually new parents (his mother especially, who's become a social climber ever since the family's sudden wealth)--though Tony doesn't cope very well, seeing as how he later develops an ulcer.Even though ""Then Again, Maybe I Won't"" isn't one of my favorites by Blume, it's still very good. In fact, I have yet to come across a book by her (either for adults or children) that I don't like. This one is more for preteen boys (age 10 - 14), but I'd still recommend it to Blume fans, regardless of age/gender."
4,"Then again,maybe you should read this book","I bought this book for a nickel from a used book sale at a local library. I wasn't sure if I'd like it,but I tried it. Usually I don't read a lot of books with male protagonists;this is an exception. Tony had to deal with new wealth,moving away,coping with problems,and making decisions about his future. Like real boys,he and his friends tried to do macho things. ""Then Again,Maybe I Won't"" is like a guy's version of ""Are You There,God? It's me,Margaret"",but without religious elements. I could look into a guy's mind. Girls and boys aren't that different in some ways. We both have our insecurities. I'd reccomend this to novel to preteens."
5,Doctrine of Prayer,Very helpful with pray journey that I am on. I am using it with another study which makes the two of the a great access in my life.
1,Wow...this sucks.,"This book is essentially a glorified pamphlet. 64 pages total and more than half the book explains the rules and why Texas hold'em is popular. His strategy summed up is that you have to be tough at the table. Great! Now let me go and lose all my money.The author's photo on the back of the book is great, he looks like Lee Majors."
3,Similar to Adventures in Afropea,"While the Zap Mama a capella style is interesting, relatively unique, and enjoyable, Sabsylma is rather similar to Zap Mama's first efforts (Adventures in Afropea). If one likes Afropea, one would find Sabsylma enjoyable, as well."
1,Poorly Written,"The book is poorly written, which makes it difficult to read and understand. There are very few examples. The end of each chapter has a 10 question quiz, but there are no answers included. The practices they teach in the Prospecting section are questionable."
5,you don't nomi.....,"but nothing I can say will do justice to his brilliance. What a tragedy that Nomi died from an aids-related illness before he had time to stun the world of ordinary music fans with his unparalled voice and appearance. I saw him only once on TV, on The Old Grey Whistle Test and he was SO different! Listen and be educated."
4,Almost perfect,"I'm afraid I have to deduct a star for the failure to include either ""Wayward Sisters"" or his aria from ""Samson and Delilah,"" but this is an excellent introduction to perhaps the most bizarre talent ever to grace the world of rock."
2,it ok,this movie is ok in a thriller way. it doesnt have to much homo activity and there isnt really any nudity especially full male frontal nudity. the most homoerotic thing about this movie is that there is gay kissing.if ur into thrillers that got 2 hot guys and little homo erotic action this movie is for u.
2,Very predictable...very ordinary,"NO spark..that is what I would have to say about this film. It is true...do not judge a book or in this case a DVD by its cover!! Thought that this was going to be an interesting film, since I am into thriller, drama, suspense genres, but this one was a major let down. Boring...boring...boring!! Script read like a play...not a movie...there was not a very redeeming quality to this film whatsoever really. The actors did a decent job with what they were giving...in this case, not much, and it was talent wasted!!"
2,b-o-r-i-n-g,"This is the only movie Ive watched out of hundreds that I fast forwarded thru after discovering the body of the flick was endles dialog between the two main characters. I couldnt get any sense of suspense from the talk, and could not empathize with the theme of AIDS denial, admittance, truth-telling, and revenge. Shoulda looked at the other ** reviews before renting. Oops."
4,Guilt and Anger,"It's a strong film. All filmed in a closed space, wich increases the intensity of the story. The story itself its rather simple: a curious married man has an one-time-only sex encounter with another man that he picks up in a bar.Years later, his wife dies from aids. He blaims himself for that, and goes out for revenge. A classic of guilt and anger. You figure out the rest. I liked the film, the actors go very well."
3,24DAY,"Extremely RELEVANT film for 21st century viewers. Even married, as well as, WOMEN in committed relationships should be concerned about contracting AIDS........If you think YOUR MAN would never experiment with homosexuality - THINK AGAIN!........... My Advice: Always use condoms............. Movie was emotionally charged, true-to-life --made me weep, felt a bit of rage as well..... Women tend to be TOO TRUSTING.... Acting was better than I anticipated - credible - thoroughly entertaining (in a morbid/dark sort of way)."
5,Intense and Captivating Moments : Beware!,A must for Suspense Thriller Fans out there. I got my package from Amazon.com in pristine packaging. Delivered as promised within 2 days (via Air Freight Courier Service) Impressive Amazon.com and keep up with your awesome customer service.Simple and yet engaging movie to watch. I'd watch it more than once and definitely a GEM Collection. A Must To Own if you are a great fan of edge seating suspense thriller.
3,Payback Time,"Interesting in an age where we are still not sure who is at fault but we can certainly find others to blame for our predicaments. In the end, your still not sure who caused the illnesses but you are left thinking about what could have been done to prevent it and all the tragedy"
4,gripping,The acting is really good and the storyline gripping and believable. Recommended watching.Richard
3,"Shocking, but uneventful",This movie was shockingly eye opening. I did not find it very intertaining and frankly a bit boring.
1,Seriously Flawed,"What started out as a good film soon became one of those films where you go""hang on, what about...?"" The director seems to have dropped several threads which should have been carried forward (why didn't he ever have to go to the bathroom again?) and just the reality of the setting, the premise, the whole thing left me thinking that there was so much that wasn't explored or taken into account. A really worthless film that could have shone in better hands."
3,H.I.V./ A.I.D.S warning styled movie..,"...like a college live act and a suspense movie in one. ever seen ""gossip"" with the same male actor? definitely had dry spots, but overall if your trying to teach that promiscuous or sexually irresponsible friend(s) a lesson - buy this movie. other than that don't."
1,What a waste of money,It certaintly demonized sex and people living with AIDS. The most horrible trash I've seen in years. Don't they both have some personal responsibility?
3,maybe better,The actors are huge but the message is a little distorted and causes that the viewer is confused. But in general he is acceptable.
1,Is it real of is it fake,"I can't believe this could happen in real life. Perhaps there should be a part 2: 24 days after, joy and pleasure, no hate and pain"
2,Not the Classic John Mantley Story,"There's a 1957 film of the same name, by director William Asher and starring Gene Barry: THE 27th DAY. It's based on the terrific John Mantley speculative fiction novel; this is not it, nor is it a remake of any sort. Those looking for the original won't as yet find it on DVD, and should not mistake this film for that one in any way. This is a completely different genre, and far from a classic. If you want to enjoy the original story, you can still find the book on Amazon.com, and hope for a DVD release of the film."
3,A tough thriller to watch - but an important addition to queer cinema,"The fact that the dilemma in this film is 'did he or didn't he?', makes it really less about the gay connection between the two characters and more about gay shame and homophobia as it relates to HIV infection and the black cloud of 'responsibility' that drives Scott Speedman's character.This is a tense little film from beginning to end and explores that niche in the cinema of the dance between captor and captured. Though it's not on the front pages of newspapers any more, this film rides the wave of anger and hostility to the gay community, portrayed by many camps as 'responsible' for spreading AIDS by behaving 'irresponsibly' or 'recklessly'. That's really what the central idea of this movie is, and it's riveting, as well as disturbing.Fine performances by both leads (who are virtually the only two characters in the film) make it a worthwhile experience."
1,AIDS-Phobia!!! Don't Watch. Terrible Public Message,"As soon as I realized where this movie was going, I became terrified. I guess that's the thrilling part of the movie. I am astonished by the positive reviews. Maybe they are all young people. Maybe they haven't thought much about AIDS. Maybe they believe in false imprisonment and retribution in this setting. Maybe they cannot detect the heterosexism and AIDS-phobia. These are real issues. This movie trivializes them. Go ahead and vote that this wasn't a helpful review. Just because I disagree with you this does not mean my review isn't helpful. For mature individuals, if you want a complex discussion of AIDS, avoid this.No one INFECTS YOU with HIV. Your failure to protect yourself leaves you vulnerable to the virus. The entire premise for this movie is terrible."
2,Preaching dressed up as entertainment,"Two strong and convincing leads don't make up for the cheesy stage-play feeling and meandering dialog from two characters who I never really cared much about. Neither seems too redeemable or likeable.This film is preachy without being very entertaining. There is a message here, and it's a good one, but it's delivered in a melodramatic (and unnecessarily violent) fashion that's overdone and lacking hope or redeemability. As is the set.Interesting to see, but pretty sad, scary, and not very fun."
2,24th day - more like a death sentence.,"I really wish I had read some reviews before buying this tragic waste of talent and film. The plot is wandering in a black hole, feels like a dreary nightmare in some vortex that never ends.The script is just too generic and these actors are much more talented than this script allows.It is a weak plot about 2 men that ""hook up"" to only find out that this is not their first night together. One is HIV+ looking for someone from his past to blame, the other is a serial player who has no memory of their first encounter.The ""twist"" of this is really more of an unravelling of your last nerve should you be able to stand the entire thing.DO NOT waste your money or time on this enourmous flop."
5,The Most Incredible Movie I Have Ever Seen!!!,"I wish this rating system had a choice of more than just 5 stars. This is definitely the best film I have ever had the pleasure of seeing, and I would recommend it to any movie lover (as long as your idea of a good time isn't limited to just Napoleon Dynamite or Talladega Nights). Packed with intelligent, bone-chilling dialogue, this movie will never leave you once you watch it.""Now is that the true truth, or is that your truth?"""
4,important subject dealed with intregity and humanism,"important to know what humans should face, this film brings us light on modern life"
3,Gay Thriller Movie -- decent,"This was an oddly weird but attractive movie where you have to carefully follow the plot but still may get turn around. It's a very simple movie basically set in one main location but the movie jumps around to different times and places to explain the story. I would recommend it (since I did watch in twice in a row to pass the time) but I would say that you really need to watch it closely if you want to understand the plot. One of the options for tagging this review was ""Male Full frotnal Nudity""? I guess I need to watch it again!"
4,Postmodern Parable Displaying Traditional Certitudes,"A filmed play. Well acted, angst riddled tome on the consequences of 'innocent' lies that are 'required' to navigate in todays world."
2,Too fake-looking,"I should have realized this was made for cosplay. I got it for my sister, who's as much of a Tsubasa fan as I am, hoping she could wear it with a nice outfit as a pretty necklace. The fact that it's plastic doesn't really bother me (you can't tell by looking), but it's way too big to wear as a normal piece of jewelry. It's basically just for wearing to anime cons to meet other Tsubasa fans. I wouldn't recommend it for everyday wear or special occasions."
2,its plastic,"It's plastic, so if that doesn't bother you at all, then it's an OK necklace. The feather itself was larger than I expected, and the shade of pink made it seem overly childish. I origionally bought it for myself, but I ended up giving it to my daughter because I thought it was going to be pewter at least, and I dont like wearing plastic."
5,"CAN'T PUT IT DOWN, AND I'M A GIRL!","Christmas present, birthday present, valentine's present, no-special-occasion present: this book makes me HAPPY! I can't imagine anyone not falling in love with it. It brought back floods of ecstatic memories -- and of course, I had to read it while drinking a shaken/not/stirred martini! BRAVO! MORE BOOKS from Mr. Biederman's archives -- and WOW, can he write! Wry, witty, charming, impeccably researched -- 10 STARS!"
3,Not what is shown in the picture...,"This product says that it is a DVD and CD included... it's only the DVD. I'm disappointed, but what am I gonna do about my $4.97 including shipping and handling?? I purchased it from Peachtree Food Services... maybe that was my first mistake. Be aware!!!"
5,"There is Only You "" Harry Connick Jr. """,Come on it's Harry Connick Jr. for cryin out loud.. If you like his music buy this.. if not ... probably will not like it... but you may!
4,different...but good,"Although I much prefer Ani's older work's , this album is fun and funky. Not as "" angry"" as most expect Ani's music to be, but her solid vocals soar through the various instrumentation.My favorite two tracks are the title track and ""O My My""."
3,Very Evolved!,"I was recently reading some reveiws of ""Ani DiFranco"", the first CD from Ani, and it seems that most of the reveiws including the favorable ones were saying things like 'Well her lyrics are fine and she's got alot of great one liners, but the music is sparse and her lyrics don't seem to stay on subject'. This was somwhat true, but it's beside the point. None of that was Ani's appeal. So let's skip to 'Evolve'; basicly I could say there are very few of her trademark one-liners and the compositions are MUCH more refined. Her lyrics are much deeper and definitely stay on subject. All of this is great but I miss the Ani Difranco from 'Puddle Dive' and 'Out Of Range' who said, ""If you're not angry/then you're just stupid or you don't care!"" And yes I heard ""Angry Anymore"", from 1999's ""Up, Up, Up, Up, Up"" saying that she's not, well angry anymore. This doesn't change the fact that the old Ani was alot more fun."
2,Dull when Compared to Recent Projects,"For years I've been a huge fan of Ani Difranco, and as an old fan I've been rather impressed by her newer material; however ""Evolve"" is my least favorite ""Ani"" record.The lyrics contain statements of weariness, regret and self-loathing, and that unmistakable and optimistic, Difranco sense of humor is hard to find. Much of the music seems forced and lacking spontaneous inspiration. In ""Slide"" Ani even reuses an old ear-catching line first heard in a song titled, ""Out of Habit.""Evolve isn't all that bad though. The title track is great as well as ""In the way"" and ""Phase."" If you're a die-hard Difranco fan, you'll certainly want to take a listen. But in my opinion this record doesn't even come close to any of the musical standards Ani has set in the past."
2,Dull When Compared to More Recent Projects,"For years I've been a huge fan of Ani Difranco, and as an old fan I've been rather impressed by her newer material; however ""Evolve"" is my least favorite Ani record.Many of the lyrics contain statements of weariness, regret and self-loathing, and that unmistakable and optimistic, Difranco sense of humor is hard to find.

But in my opinion this record doesn't even come close to any of the musical standards Ani has set in the past."
5,It's isn't the first time around....,"that you actually like this album, I've been a pretty hardcore Ani fan for years and most of her albums (of recent) have taken multiple listens before they settle on me. It's because they aren't the same thing you hear on every album. Don't get me wrong I love the classics Anticipate, Fire Door, Both Hands, etc... but there is something to be said for her recent subtlety instead of having to hit you over the head with a hammer. If you're not used to listeing to Ani and you don't like this album I would suggest going back and picking up Dilate, Not a Pretty Girl, Not So Soft, Anticpate... or the like and then coming back to Evolve. After a few listens you get a real feel for the music and an artist that is at the top of her game. Some old fans don't like the new direction they'd rather listen to Andy and Sarah Lee, but most things need to change eventually as witnessed by Ani touring solo without her band; back to the old old old days."
2,There was a time,"when waiting for Ani's next CD was maddening torture. The day it arrived in the mail, I would blow off whatever I had to do for the next several hours and lie on the floor listening in drunken bliss. It was so precious and sacred I had to be alone with it --any distraction would make me crazy. I have come to believe those days will never come again. I have all the respect in the world for Ani and can't imagine ever not buying her work, but musically (the lyrcis are as strong as ever) it just doesn't do it for me anymore and hasn't for several CDs."
3,Its Okay.....but maybe my tastes have changed,"I own every Ani cd prior to this one.When I shelled out the double bucks for this double cd, I only enjoyed ONE song."
2,Has ANI gone soft?,"Ani Difranco's new CD Evolve does a good job of how she has ""evolved"" in her music. It's a different sound unlike any of her other CD's. It encompasses more of a blues/jazz sound. The music is still high quality but the lyrics lack the passion and desire that has fueled her music for so many years. If you're looking for music to loose yourself in, then I would recommend listening to any of her previous CD's. Those are the ones that grab hold of your soul and won't let go. As for Evolve...I think (sadly) she has evolved into a softy and a sellout."
3,It's no Revelling Reckoning,"It's been a few years since Ani's put out a CD, so with that amount of time, I was anticapating another classic like Revelling Reckoning. Evolve has some catchy songs, but if it wasn't for Ani voice sounding a bit aged, I would have guessed that this alubm was made six months after RR, because most songs seem to scrape the bottom of the creative barrel. Think RR as Californication and Evolve as By the Way."
2,don't believe the hype,"OK So I wanted to like Ani, but my first listen to this album made me want to give her a prozac and tell her life will be ok. She sounds to angry and can't sing. Her band plays well though. I liked #5 though. I guess I would have to listen to it a few times before I fall for her. Either that or completely avoid her."
4,better than i expected,"this one flows for sure. ""serpentine"", a 10 min long song-poem is just outstanding. ""here for now"" is now one of my favorite ani songs. four stars 'cuz personally i prefer the live versions of ""shrug"" and ""welcome to:"". ""slide"" is a great song.the playing and production is fine. very relevant music for our mad times. and if you don't own ""not a pretty girl"", i recommend that as well."
2,Eh.,"I don't like the album because it's too easy listening. I found it hysterical that someone pulled the ""this is what happens when she marries a man"" card, and I think the pulling the gender card on Ani by way of an old school fan is incredibly ironic.Again, it's too easy listening to me. She rocked out, she doesn't so much now. That's all fair and good. I've heard it by way of my roommate who loves it. I can't give it one star because that puts me in the class of people who scream ""Ani you're a sellout how could you desert us!!!"" which means very little to me. I say if she's happy with what she's doing, more power. I just kinda wish she kept rockin is all. If that's what you want, don't buy this."
5,She never ceases to amaze me,"Obviously, I'm quite a huge Ani fan- but it is without bias that I say- THIS IS AN AMAZING ALBUM! If you are an avid Ani fan, than I'm sure you've seen as well as I, her subtle transition from folk to jazz, and Evolve melts both together and even adds in a touch of latin flavor. If you're a first time Ani fan, I would suggest going back and starting from the beginning (self-titled) to see it for yourself, but either way, it's definately worth your while. This album is fun, melodic, politically driven, inspired and just a dang good listen. Evolving is precisely what Ani is doing and we all get to benefit from it. P.S.- If you're not a jazz fan, this ain't for you."
4,more up up then toothy,"over the corse of anis career, ive grown to like her style more and more.toping the list is to the teeth. so i ran out and got evolve as soon as i rembered it came out.but it reminded me so much of up up up in the fact that it leaves an uncomforatble feeling somewhere inside you, without the catchy lyrics of to the teeths ""back back back""hower, ""slide""really stands out on this albumn talking about a girl who laid down in a party dress, and never got up.maybe others like this more because its returning to earlier stuff. but whatever, its her career!!"
2,DEVOLVED,"Sorry folks, Ani is done. Over. Tired. Played out.Ever since Andy Stochanski & Sarah Lee left the band & Julie Wolf entered, Ani's music has devolved into a series of trite, wandering, sprawling & downright uninteresting tracks. I haven't gotten into a CD of DiFranco's since ""Little Plastic Castle"" and even that album wasn't phenomenal.I'm all for growth and experimentation, but when you stray too far from the formula, you lose your core audience. Count me out for this release."
5,Enchanting...an album with staying power.,"I first heard Luka Bloom's Acoustic Motorbike and happened upon this album by chance. Having liked what I had heard, I picked it up on impulse. It's turned out to be one of the best CD purchase decisions I have ever made.The songs are all enchanting, filled not only with deep lyrics but with skilled guitar tunes that will keep you hooked. Even the most uptempo tunes on the album seem to put me in a very serene mood. I found myself moved by more than a few of the tunes. Diamond Mountain and Black is the Colour are two of the best written songs, sung soulfully, that I have ever heard.If you are a fan of acoustic guitar, pure music, lyrical mastery, I can't recommend this album enough. You may also find yourself digging through the store for every shred of Luka Bloom you can buy -- but you'll always return to this incredible collection."
5,emotional turf,"From the claustrophobic gorgeousness of ""true blue"" to the choking refrain of ""Sanctuary"" this album is exemplary of a gifted musician's catalog."
5,The best cd of this century!,"I was there in Utrecht (Holland) when Luka asked the audience to sing the intro of the Fertile Rock. And it was so warm and emotional that evening, that it was a very big surprise for me that it was much more warmer and emotional on this cd. Whit this cd Luka has made the best of this century. I can't imagine that there will be a better one ever. The most beautiful song is Diamond Mountain. Sorry for any mistakes, but I'm Dutch. --MAA26555.907270522/online-1.amazon.com--"
5,"Crystal clear voice, instruments and thought.","This disc never wanders far from my player. It is almost a mystical experience every time it's played. From the haunting ""Sunny Sailor Boy"" to the concrete judgement of our times in ""Right Here, Right Now"", I find this disc packs a wallop in so many different veins. I first heard Bloom on the Today show several years ago and thought he sounded like an interesting musician and individual. Coming from the Isle that has already given us U-2, Van Morrison, Altan and scores of others I figured I'd at least get a dose of soul, if not credible musicianship. I got both! May you find your ""Diamond Mountain"" on this ""Fertile Rock""."
2,Acoustic Mope Rock,"This CD of Luka, his guitar, and some of the most depressing songs around is just too musically repetitive. One song sounds so like the next that it is tough to distinguish one from another, regardless of the topic. While lyrically challenging, the lack of variation in sound defeated me and this one will rarely get another spin."
5,Direct replacement for my lamp,This bulb arrived quickly and was well packed. It works perfectly. At a lower price than from the lamp manufacturer.
4,"Move, MOVES!","Earl Klugh is a master of his craft, his style and music speaks volumes of what he's capable of. This early 90's work is STILL a great indicator of what this man was capable of, and what he still had in store for us. I've seen him in concert MANY times and VERY few do it as well. Pick this one up if you're looking to ""fill in"" your Jazz collection and pick it up if you're an Earl Klugh fan and this one slipped by you!"
3,Just questions and answers.,"This book is full of real exam questions from the Board certification exam, however there are no explanations for any of the answers. Works well for a practice exam situation, but if you want something to really help you study i suggest ""Clinical Laboratory Science Review, A Bottom Line Approach"""
4,Helpful,"I used this when I was reviewing to take my CLS exam. Most of the Questions were out of this world though.... too hard! But I just did familiarize myself and understand it more.... I did pass the CLS exam! Yepeee! I am planning to take the ASCP soon... so, this would be helpful again."
2,Waste of time/money,"I wish my instructor never recommended this book. Again, so many questions and no explanations of the answers. The questions may give you an idea of what you're in for, but it makes for a lousy study guide. The NCA review book is much better since it includes axplanations...even if you're not actually taking the NCA exam, I found that review book more valuable then the a,b,c, and d that ASCP gives you."
4,Study guide,"This book was excellent. It has questions for MLT's and for MT's. When I took my ASCP certification test for my MLT EVERY QUESTION WAS FROM THIS BOOK!!! I went back to college and got my BA (MT) and knew that it had questions for MT's too, so I went back and memorized every question in this book (There are usually between 300-400 questions per section). When I took my MT ASCP certification test it was not the same story, but I found out that there is now a new addition. I did pass my certification both times (MLT and MT) with this book, but there is a newer edition. So if you can answer all the questions in this book and know why they are the answer that they are then you should not have a problem on a registry test, but just know that there is a NEWER edition and if you can memorize that book, those questions are probably the ones that you will see on the ASCP test."
4,Good Charger,It charges the batteries in a fair amount of time. Has a LED that changes from red to green when the charge is complete. Good price and small to carry around... can be charged with a cigarette lighter in your car. Perfect!
1,Dissapointing,"I had eagerly anticipated this book for a long time, but I found it very dissapointing.It's more of a quick retelling of the struggle for the throne after Henry VIII's death than a biography of Jane. She's a minor character in her own biography, emerging only for brief, tersely described events."
2,Jane Grey fan,"I didn't read much of ""Lady Jane Grey: Nine Days Queen"", but that's due to the author. However, the book is skimpy and regulated to ""this event happened"" and ""He/she did/said this and that"". Alison Plowden is a good and factual writer, but this time she paints by the numbers. Also, in her excellent four-book biography of Elizabeth I, Plowden's attitude resembles Hester W. Chapman's; she tends to get a bit terse and condescending. I guess this is why I didn't finish ""Lady Jane Grey: Nine Days Queen"". I simply didn't want to encounter Plowden's attitude again while reading about my favorite Tudor princess."
2,That's NOT Jane Grey,"Too bad the front cover has a portrait of Queen Katherine Parr, NOT Jane. Big mistake. I refuse to even pick up a book which has the wrong portrait of the person the author has done a biography on."
5,Amazing Album!,"Others have reviewed this album for shipping concerns, and for it not having some song, but what they have failed to mention is the music on the album is magnificent. It's Over, Something to Lose, and First Dance are filled with emotion and anyone who has ever been in a relationship can relate to them. You can feel the soul and emotion in his voice, and his lyrics are powerful. This is a must buy, along with his other albums. If you like mainstream musicians who do not write their own music and cannot perform worth a damn in concert then Corey is not for you. On the other hand, if you enjoy a true musician with incredible talent and a bullheaded refusal to join a major label...Corey Smith is your guy!"
2,wrong CD,"this CD has a different song list than what is listed on amazon's website. i only ordered it for one song, ""i'm not gonna cry"" (for a graduation theme) which isn't on this disc and i do not like the songs that are on the disc."
3,Easy Read but had to admit couldnt put it down,"Snow Falcon is a book that you can read at speed, not taxing that is for sure,,..but you still had that urge to keep reading. I enjoyed it a light read with some romance recommend it for air travel or just when wanting to pamper yourself."
5,A perfect debut novel,When I was through reading this book I could hardly believe that it is Harrison' s first novel. He has a way of writing that simply captures a reader.
4,Exciting read from a brilliant new author,"Reminiscent in style and content to Nicholas Evans' best-seller, ""The Loop"", Stuart Harrison's ""Snow Falcon"" is a sure winner. It has all the ingredients for an engrossing read: love, lust, longing, wounded lives, and a magnificent wild, but wounded, bird,vividly set in spectacular Canadian scenery, and portraying the narrowness of life in a small town. Through many trials and tribulations, both the main characters and the wounded gyr falcon come to find healing and freedom to ""fly"" again. A delightfully ""visual"" novel: it would make a great movie!"
5,The Right One,"Dan Penn has recorded only a handful of solo albums during his long career as a songwriter and performer, but they are all good, including this excellent comeback (his first album in over 20 years) from 1994. We already knew he was a great songwriter, but Penn shows off his prowess as a very soulful singer in his own right, performing ace versions of ""The Dark End of the Street,"" ""I'm Your Puppet"" and many others. This was an excellent, woefully neglected album that is sadly out of print. If you can find a copy, grab it!"
3,Some things are not in the Description,To my shock...there was nothing in the description that mentioned that if you want to make anything in this book you will need about $700.00 in equipment and supllies!Other than that it is a good technical book with lots of pretty pictures and instructions.
2,unless you already know,the info in this book is for people that already know about this subject and for a beginner its kinda hard to understan its still a cool book but its just a little difficult. i recomend this book if you already know what your doing.
3,Psilocybin Production,"It needs to be edited/emended to read more smoothly and in in clearer layperson's terms, but I did like it.TD"
2,"Short, found out some info, confused by the rest...","This was an interesting little read, though I don't know if I learned much useful information except that raising mushrooms seems to be a super-tedious task. The author writes as if the reader is supposed to know what the heck he's talking about, but I sure didn't. Perhaps someone with some laboratory know-how would find this book informative, perhaps not. Since I'm not a lab person, I don't know if his methodology is practical or not."
1,They must be joking: 4 discs for $26+ = Four 30 minute programs!,"As much as I enjoy the Lidia's Italy TV show on PBS, and think that she does a superb job of presenting Italian cuisine and food culture, these discs are an insult to her audience and the intelligence of the public in general. It's not that the programs are bad, they are in fact some of the better episodes from her fine and always educational series. It's that you are paying for a four disc set, repeat A FOUR DISC SET, and then come to find that there's nothing on the discs but one 30 minute episode per disc, and the video quality isn't even all that great. Four discs should have had one entire season of the show, or at least four to six 30 minute episodes per disc. Shame on you Amazon, and shame on you Tavola Productions. Avoid this vastly over priced disc set."
4,Good Product,"I bought this machine for my classroom and it works great. It set up easy- I didn't need to use the directions to get it working. I plugged it into the wall and hooked the cable up to my ibook and turned it on, hit enter and it was running. I run the machine with all of my overhead florescent lights in my class on and the clarity of the picture is great. I have not tried viewing video on it, yet, which is why I only gave four stars. I did my homework before buying this machine, and given the opportunity would purchase it again."
2,"Wish we had known the ""Costs of Ownership"" before we bought it.","While the $1000 price tag with the screen and a 3 year warrantee are attractive, the cost of around 1/3($320+) the price for a BULB after less than 1 year of use is absolutle ripoff! The 3 year extended warrantee does not cover bulbs, which after I called for service the technician told me that is usually what fails--so the extended warrantee in my case has proved useless. I would tell anyone considering this NOT to buy it because of the SHORT shelf life and cost of ownership after the initial purchase."
5,FUN!,My 1 year old loves this toy! He rocks and rocks forever! He laughs whenever the siren goes off an dclaps when he pushes the button that makes a cheering noise. It is very lightweight and durable! This is a must have!
3,Too loud for my son,"This toy is too loud for my 17 month old son, and it scares him. Now he cries just looking at it. There is no on and off button for the sound, and I would have to take out the batteries.The sound is actually loud even for adult. It also requires some minor assembly, which I did not expect based on the picture of the packaging."
5,Fantastic Toy!,"Our 13 mo. old LOVES this toy and I adore it too! It's so lightweight yet also sturdy. He rocks & rocks and sometimes even tumbles to the side for fun (hence my love for the lightweight construction). He loves the buttons and sounds, and has learned about the ""key"" feature where if you keep rocking it ""speeds up & the lights go on"" and it ""decelerates"" when he slows down. Very cool! He plays in his superyard with this for long periods of time. Experiments with sitting frontwards & backwards or leaning over it, just has a blast. Worth every penny!"
4,My Son Loves This Toy...,"I was excited to get this toy for my son when he was 10 months old. I rocked him in it at first, but he is slowly learning how to do it himself, which is fine. The loud noises don't scare hime, he loves to push all the buttons and hear the noises and see the flashind lights. The only problem that I have with this toy is that when the key is turned the noises go on, but they don't stay on while my son is rocking, even vigorously. They do however stay on if he is off of the rocker and I am rocking itwith my hand. My son is 12 months old and 21 pounds, I don't think that he is too heavy. I have read other reviews where they say that the sirens and the engine sounds go off the whole time that their child is rocking. I don't know whats going on, but all in all my son loves his cycle, and that is all that counts."
4,Fun but sounds are LOUD!,"My son got this for his 1st birthday. He rode it for hours non-stop and when we tried to get him off, he would cry. Beware: The sounds are very loud and there is no volume control on this. They may easily alarm a young child. It scared my son at first, but he got used to the sounds and even liked them better than riding it. One of the neat features about this toy is that if you turn the key, it starts the ""engine."" If your child rides back and forth long enough the sirens go off! It will keep your little one entertained for hours!"
3,"Nice toy, too loud","Bought this toy for our son's 1st birthday. It's a neat toy, but really needs a volume switch. Very loud and scared him every time he hit the siren button....so bad he would start crying. I tried cardboard and electrical tape over the speaker but still too loud. Ended up taking out the batteries. Now he gets on, rocks for 5 seconds, hits buttons that do nothing and gets off. Might be fun when he gets older and isnt so scared by loud noises. Also, one of the buttons makes the sound of a rioting crowd and a lady is heard screaming ""Oh no!"". Thought that was a little weird."
4,Fun. But super loud,This is a great rocker for my 17 month old son. It was very easy to assemble and seems very sturdy. Unfortunately it's also extremely loud. We had to take out the batteries because it has no volume control. The sounds are so loud it scared my son. It's a shame they couldnt include a volume control on what is otherwise a good product.
2,"Sound effects is loud and annoying, can't turn off easily...","the title says it all. My 2.5 yr old son played with it once in a while, was never that interested from the gecko. I think I played with it more than him. Finally gave it away since it was just taking up space."
3,Son not interested,"I got this for my son when he was 16 months, he is now 23 months He has never been interested in it. Its been a disappointment considering how much I paid for it. He has sat on it maybe twice and only becuase I put him on it. I guess every kid has different interests."
5,Rocking and rolling all over.,My son loved playing with the little rocker they had at daycare so we thought this would be a great Christmas gift. It was a hit. He loves rocking all over the place and turning the key and even playing the police sounds. I was sad when he grew too big to play with it anymore.
1,Not Safe for Adventuresome Toddlers and Too Scary for Non-Adventuresome Toddlers,"My 22-month old loves this toy, but I do not. My daughter is a thrill-seeker and loves nothing more than rocking as high as possible and going as fast as she can. Knowing this about her, I ensure that she wears a helmet when riding this toy and always stay close to her. I may sound over-cautious, but was glad to have taken such precautions. She easily rocks this toy over-top and lands on her head, flipping forward. I have tried placing bumpers under the toy to limit the rocking ability, but she is pretty observant and quickly removes the bumpers. So, yes, it is a fun toy, but not safe. A few neighborhood kids (age 3-5) are afraid of the toy because of the loud noises."
5,Eternal Music,"Into the Labyrinth is really a terrific album, but it's not best. Serpent's Egg is a perfect work. Here, Lisa's voice is just magical. And Perry's music is limitless..."
3,Good ambient,"I like this CD, but don't find myself wanting to listen to it again and again. If I find myself in the semi-dark ambient mood, I pop it in and take a listen. Overall, a good purchase, but not my favorite DCD collection."
4,Aonther highly appealing offering,"A short, repetitious, minimal, but often spectacular album refines further some of the haunting world-goth music this legendary duo helped pioneer. For as brief and seemingly light the album feels compositionally, Serpent's Egg still rests somewhere near the top of this immersive act's most sensual disc's on the whole. The crisp, diverse instrumentation, transportive vocals, and ethereal production all merge effortlessly to bring another modern mystical classic to their unique and impressive catalog."
4,Val Andrews is an entertaining writer,"I've read a lot of Sherlock Holmes pastiches and I have to say I like Val Andrews the best. You have to be familiar with Doyle's characters because Andrews assumes knowledge of them, but he sticks with the characters that Doyle created and I like that. The stories are not overly complicated either. I also like the detail he gives on the history of magic which is of interest to me. His stories are entertaining and the Houdini birthright was no exception."
2,"You're too young to sound like this, Marco.","Solis remains as formidable a lyricist as ever, but remember when he was more than that? Before, he could be counted on to inject some musical drama, some bombast, some spice. That's what made songs like ""Si Me Recuerdas,"" ""Acepto Mi Derrota,"" and ""Morenita"" classics. Now all we get are musically indistinguishable ballads with intrusive, ever-present strings. My suggestion: Solis should try a Bernie Taupin/Elton John-type project where he does the lyrics and leaves the melody in the hands of someone with a totally different perspective, like Julieta Venegas. It would certainly produce something more interesting than the geriatric sounding easy-listening he's putting out now."
4,Nice Album,"I purchased this CD primarily to obtain 1 song ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" The other songs were nice. No problem with the order."
1,TOO EXPENSIVE,Please send me $10 back. This is way over priced. Shame on them!! I will not get any shame on me for a second order. RIPOFF ALERT.
3,mouse,"was a very pretty mouse with a good review,but didn't hold up as well as I had hoped. Would not buy again."
1,INSTEN LCD DESKTOP TWIN CHARGER FOR MOTOROLA V600,"IT WAS STOLEN BY THE DELIVERY TO COLOMBIA, HE HAVE A BAD FAITH!!! ONE YEAR LATER!!!"
1,Nothing new or detailed,"I think I read this book from cover to cover in one day and I found it to be anything but entertaining. In a luxurious 87 page presentation, the author narrates her experiences breastfeeding her four children and presents useful advice for breastfeeding mothers. if you have never attend a breasfeeding class (or talked to your friends about the topic). This book is also full of colloquial terms used in England, which I found fascinating but not helpful when you are looking for clues on how to succeed at breastfeeding. I would recomendThe Nursing Mother's Companion: Revised Edition."
2,It didn't do it for me...,"He fall in love with a ghost! I gotta say, after reading so many books written by Barbara Cartland, this one didn't single out of the average novel.For those who don't know what this book is about here is the long story short: she hides in the attic while his brother entertains the Earl among other bachelors, he saw her once and he thought she must be a ghost. Then they meet each other and they fall in love. The end."
4,beautiful,"my favourite cartland novel, I feel its imagery and emotions are more poignant. unlike many cartland novels that simply end in marriage it provides a brief glimpse after that event making the theme of love more meaningful and lasting."
4,great for law students,This dictionary explains all those tricky latin words that pop up in your casebook. It is a lot more easy to understand than Black's and is lightweight enough to be carried in your backpack.
5,Letter Writing In Days Gone By,"I was so glad to find a book that spoke to my heart about letter writing. This little book is a quick read, but it's chock full of ideas, pictures and information on the art of letter writing in the days of pen and ink. It brought back to my mind those rows and rows of circles I drew in my notebooks in second grade to force my hand to be light and agile for all the words I was going to write. My penmanship grew slowly better and so did my posture, as I practiced my skill. Those days are gone. We can now look forward to slumped shoulders, tunnel carpel syndrome and sore eyes from staring at that lit computer screen. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the art of writing letters by hand, a very favorable experience and unique little book."
1,Junk,"Doesn't work! Tried it on at least 10 different PCs (different makes, models, laptops, desktops, XP and Vista) - not one would recognize the ""Fun"" drive. I've had other Kingston USB drives that work OK, but this ones a dud."
4,Uphill Battle is worth it,"A good review of cycling's great climbers, this book is a window into many of the great climbing by bike performances. As you read many of the heroic uphill battles that have taken place within cycling's major tours, Mulholland has you on the hill, feeling the rider's pain. Many of these accounts will be unknown to all but the most rapid cycling fan and deserve to be told. While only including major European climbing exploits, this account is a good addition to a cycling library. For a collection of American climbing exploits (along with the most difficult hillclimbs in the U.S. and other climbing information) see the book 'The Complete Guide to Climbing (By Bike)' from Extreme Press."
2,"Mediocre stories, poorly told","This book reads more like a series of magazine articles than a coherent history.Mulholland has some grammatical quirks - mostly his pronouns get out of whack - making me read many sentences several times to sort out who he's talking about. He is fixated on Franco and torture in Spain; this gets somewhat boring.Other quirks that really made me want to put the book down even though I wanted to know the stories were his repeated parenthetical explanations of things like the fact that 'Giro d'Italia' is the Tour of Italy. If he thinks his readership don't already know this, he could explain it once and then leave it alone. Lavishes praise on Armstrong, bags out Pantani, and ignores Virenque.Some good stories, but I found the grammatical and stylistic problems greatly distracting."
2,Vague reviews,"As impressive and thorough the book appear, you really shouldn't judge the book by the number of pages.My problem with the Penguin Guide from day way is that the reviews are often extremely vague or really quite meaninless. One starts to wonder infact if the reviewer(s) really did carefully listen to the recordings.To paraphrase, comments like ""it is a spirited performance"" or ""the performance was fresh"" are akin to saying the cd was ""really nice"".I only read it for comments about the sonic quality (i.e. the bass is lacking, or the strings sound very harsh) rather than the artistic merits of the recordings.I would stick to back issues of Grammophon magazine or American Record Collector for detailed thoughtful reviews. As for books I recommend Grammophon CD Guide or even the Rough Guide to Classical Music."
5,Biased towards English composers but still great,"I've been going by this book since 1988, only because I agree with their reviews more than anyone else. Yes, their English preferences are still there, and they need to do something about the ever-expanding size of the recorded classical music world. One 2000 page book is just not going to cut it anymore. I believe the only solution is to maybe break it up into volumes, the first book to cover A - L, and the second one to cover M - Z. On the English composers bias, It has introduced me to composers that I've never would have heard otherwise, like Malcolm Arnold, Robert Simpson, George Lloyd, Edmund Rubbra and Michael Tippett. I believe those composers really are great symphonists....I agree with the Penguin Guide writers 99% of the time. I never would have heard Vagn Holmboe, Einojuhani Rautavaara or Harald Saeverud as well. Thank you Penguin Guide!"
3,Bias,"I generally think this is a very good reference tool, however I strongly agree of bias towards American orchestras/quartets, etc. As an example, one of the things I like about Penguin is that they review a LOT of cds. So how could you not even mention Bernsteins DG cycle of Mahlers symphonies. Look it up-with all of their individual reviews of symphonies 1-9, not even referenced as good or bad.. Also, the Cleveland String Quartet not being mentioned for the Beethoven quartets, their work is outstanding and known worldwide--again, nada.. I love European musicians and my cd library reflects that, however I sure wouldn't use this as a definitive guide or you'll miss some great music. Of the heavy hitters, if you can only choose one, I would recommend it be Gramophone."
2,good doorstop,"While it's no fault to promote its own country's music industry, as a guide it is misguiding. After all, in the over 300 years from Bach to today, the only composer from Britain and its numerous former colonies who ever made to the periphery of major league is Elgar. The Britisher's authority on this matter then very likely relies on the domination of the English language and that Americans are even less likely salesmen of fine music. Its coverage on British composers is out of proportion as if one had to take film composers such as V-W, Arnold, Alwyn, Bliss etc. seriously. Its enthusiasm on British lables and performers is effusive and embarassing as if the British Isles were a Hollywood of classical music."
5,Outstanding,"If there is one song that you listen to in your Lifetime, let it be: ""Forever Young"", on this album. I don't care too much about the other songs, but No 13 - gets you where is counts - THE SOUL. . .. . . "" may your song always be sung . . .""Thank you Chrissy Hinde . . . in your last triumphant, clarion call to humanity . . ."
5,Just listen,"This is what good pop music sounds like. If you have any affinity for the sound you've ever heard from The Pretenders, this album will make you smile."
5,One of my favourite albums,"This is my only Pretenders album, so far... I love it! It's one of my favorite albums and I want more of their albums. some of the songs on this album are only good but most of them are great, like ""Revolution"", ""All My Dreams"", ""I'm a mother"", ""Night In My Veins"" and the Bob Dylan cover ""Forever Young"". The most famous song from this album, ""I'll Stand By You"", is great but it's not typical for the album! Buy this album! You won't get disappointed!"
2,not what I expected,"I did not like the second story in this book, and so I threw the book away after reading it. The second story heroine seperates from her husband of 25 years over minor misunderstandings. She won't go back to him until he agrees to go to marriage counseling with her. There was no adultery, abuse, or abandonment. The story bothered me, because in real life, many who seperate end up divorced. This woman didn't have just cause for divorce and should have been willing to work through their problems while staying with her husband.The first story was fine."
2,Christmas in the elevator,"You know how some soft jazz sounds like elevator music? You know how Christmas elevator music puts your teeth on edge?There are 2 or 3 interesting tracks in the dozen, but the 4 awful songs made me put this disc in the trash."
1,Front wheels do not operate correctly,I would not recommend this product. The front wheels do not turn properly and stay sideways when pulling and turning...I am very disappointed with Little Tikes. I have a wagon that is 15 years old and it has been great but this one is not a quality product....
2,AWFUL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ASSEMBLY!!,"My daughter received this wagon as a gift and absolutely loves it, however, she was fast asleep when I assembled the monster! The directions were awful and I was so frustrated at the end of the process that I almost returned it! The front two wheels do not move simultaneously when pulled and often go in two different directions. I emailed the company with questions as to how this might be fixed and they have not responded. I pull her in it and she loves to ride and climb in and out of it. From a little person perspective, its the cats meow...from the more discerning adult perspective, I wouldn't buy it again."
4,He returned....and we all are better for it!,"A highly enjoyable DVD edition, this 1973 entry welcomes Sinatra back after his brief retirement. While his voice is no longer as seamless and effortless as it was in prior years, it is nonetheless amazing, as his style remains wholly intact. It is great to hear and see him start the program with songs from his grandiose past, and these remain the highlight of the DVD. The Gene Kelly segments to me, seem a tad corny and forced, yet they are tolerable and fun. The then-new selections such as ""You Will Be My Music"", ""Let Me Try Again"", and ""Send In The Clowns"" are all beautifully performed and are fitting at this stage of his career. The picture and sound quality of the DVD is fine, probably the best it could be considering the mono source it was transferred from."
5,!,"For Christ's sake make it simple! All I want to know is ""Is this video available for me to buy, will it run on the UK's VHS system and, if so, what do I do to order it?"
4,Fun Cookbook,"This is a great cookbook for anyone whose kids have Easy Bake ovens. The book provides nice alternatives to the crappy pre-made mixes normally associated with the oven. They aren't necessarily health oriented such as many contain nuts, but they allow your kids to make freshily made treats as opposed to using processed products."
3,Hmm...,"In this cookbook, you need to buy many hard-to-find excess food items and you spend lots of extra money. I suggest going to budget101.comFrom budget101, You can print out MANY free home-made recipes, for the Easy-bake Oven. Recipes include making Dessert Pizza, snowball cookies, snow mounds, deep dish pizza, chocolate peanut butter bars, chocolate cake, crazy cake, frostings, double fudge brownies, chocolate chip cookies, and SO much more! The ingredients needed for the recipes are very easy-to-find and common, like sugar and baking powder,so no going out to the store to buy excess food ingredients. You are saving a lot of money, and baking more simply delicious recipes for your Easy-Bake Oven, unlike the ""Baking With Mommy"" cookbook. So why run out to the store and buy excess ingredients, when you could print out simply delicious recipes for FREE?"
1,Don't spend your money,"The recipes my wife and daughter wanted to make called for powdered eggs. I spent a lot of time at Walmart and Kroger trying to find powdered eggs. All I received was MANY strange looks from employees. NOBODY I talked to had ever heard of powdered eggs. You don't need much. $14 or so was the lowest price I could find for a small quantity on Amazon.In retrospect, I would not purchase the easy bake oven again. You either pay a fortune for their mixes, or you pay a fortune for this book and ingredients. Also had a difficult time finding the correct bulb for the oven."
3,NO IMPORTA....SEGUIRAN SIENDO LOS MEJORES!,"Primeramente quiero decir que el Conjunto Primavera es uno de los grupos norteños mas perrones. Siempre he comprado sus CD's, simplemente porque tienen un estilo phenomenal y pienso seguirlos comprando. Realmente este ultimo CD no me gusto mucho porque yo esperaba otro CD Norteñisimo y resulta que todas las canciones son baladas. A mi me encantan mas las canciones norteñas, de esas que te hacen bailar TODA la noche. Como dije, de todas formas seguire comprando los CD's pero ojala el proximo sea al verdadero estilo PRIMAVERA. Saludos a toda mi gente preciosa de MEXICO. Que viva Mexico! Ajua!"
4,GT compilation,GT compilation is a great cd. i like rap and i link tha this realy is a great way to express jesus in this form of music.the words are very deep in what the meen and say to you. this cd is a 4 star cd.
5,Shoe Shine Girl,I have been looking for the movie Shoe Shine Girl for about 12 years now and i can't find it anywhere.I used to watch it all the time when i was a little girl but i don't really remember the main characters names. I heard somewhere along the line that it is a Laurel and Hardy flic. If you have any info. PLEASE email me at skylucor@aol.com. Thanks! :)
3,Good summary of previous works,"If this is the first that you have ever heard of postmodernism and the church, this is an incredible book for you to read. If you have read some other books by Sweet, it contains some expanded but not earth shattering new insights on the church in the 21st century. Everything considered, I am glad I bought the book."
2,"Lacks depth, critical thinking","If you enjoy the average popular book on the shelf of your average Christian book store, like Purpose Driven Whatnot, you may enjoy this book. It is full of short anecdotes and cute stories, some mildly challenging and some entertaining.If you are looking for a serious or critical discussion of post-modern thinking and how is does or does not jive with Christian thinking, look elsewhere."
4,Excellent Book by Modern Master,"This book was printed quite some time ago, so many of the images are black and white, a small drawback when using this book for study (except to see how values are handled).Burt Silverman, like John Singer Sargent, records people in frozen states and poses that are more of a nicely painted document rather than a deep insight into the model's character. This is not always the case with his work, but if you're looking for infusing your paintings with strong emotions you won't find much here. The strengths here are simply about making excellent pictures, handling methods and materials, and great insights into Burt's painting processes.I have years of experience in the watercolor technique shown in this book, you can visit my website to see some examples of this method, and you can check out my review on Burt's other book ""Breaking The Rules Of Watercolor"" here on Amazon for details on using this marvelous technique."
5,"Great book, Fine service!",Couldn't wait to get the book. So helpful the way Silverman shares his thoughts. Each painting presents it's unique problems and Burton explains how he works through them and even has failures. Inspiring!Received the book quickly and in perfect condition.Thank you.
4,A lovely movie.,"It's a great movie with great performances. Julie Walters, Rupert Grint and Laura Linney are fantastic!! It shows the importance of friendship no matter how old are you or what do you do. This is one of my favourite films."
5,Excellent Service,I loved the movie. I had ordered it exactly 4 days before I received and I did not expect to receive it so early.It's a good British film for any film buffs out there.
4,"""Harry Potter's side-kick carries this movie well!","I enjoyed ""Driving Lessons."" It's not an easy story - there's quite a bit of dysfunction in the family ofthe main character, Harry Potter's Rupert Grint, but it's a tremendous growing experience and he negotiatesthe plot, relationships and emotions exceptionally well. Kudos, Rupert! Hats off to both Julie Walters asthe mentor and to Laura Linney as the crazed mother. Nick Farrell is moving as the overwhelmed father andspouse."
5,Driving Lessons - DVD,"This was a very cute movie - reminded me of me at 17! Like all British movies, it starts slow but soon reveals all."
4,Driving Lessons,"Driving LessonsAn interesting tale of missunderstood youth.A new role for Rupert Grint who managed to get away from the Ron Weasley image.Curious that there were also others from the Harry Potter cast in this movie.Worth watching if you have the time, though it will not make history."
2,An Accident,"I had great expectations for this movie but it did not deliver. It's about the relationship that develops between a sheltered, over-religionized teenager, Ben who goes to work for over-medicated, hyper-eccentric washed-up actress Evie.The whole plot is predictable. It's obvious from the start that Ben's home life is tottering from the weight of over-religion. You see that coming form the first few scenes and can predict almost how it will end up and it ends up like you imagine. Evie's neediness borders on paralysis and it's painful to watch. Julie Walters plays a good turn as Evie but with a lack of charismatic acting by fellow lead Rupert Grint, it falls on Julie Walters and she just couldn't carry the movie alone."
2,doesn't stay in tune! poor sound,"We bought this guitar, thinking it was high quality and because it was pink. My daughter has been using this for almost 2 years and recently changed guitar teachers. We are always having to tune it. We changed the strings thinking that was the problem. Nope, the strings just don't stay tuned. The sound is also very weak. Our guitar teacher is recommending us to buy a different one now for a fraction of what we payed! Lesson learned, don't go on looks or price of a guitar...ASK your professional what they recommend!!"
2,Entirely too small,I agree with the woman who said the guitar was too small. Definitely not for anyone over the age of 10. Am now going to have to go to the trouble of returning for a larger size. This will not be an easy process. And it was a Christmas Present for my granddaughter who right now has nothing to play. Bummer.
1,weak,"I bought this for my wife and were excited about the small size and the shape because it would allow for more ""options"" for us to use it together.When she used it the first time, she said.it was a little weak, so we decided to try again another time. several days later, we included it again, and once again she said it was just too weak.It has been in the drawer every since. Definitely a waste if money for us"
2,Not strong enough,"My fiance liked how the 'massager' looked, felt, as well as the size and shape of it, but didn't think it vibrated strong enough. Since it simply isnt strong enough, we aren't going to use it much.Whats the return policy on personal massagers???"
3,It's ok.,"The pulse functions are nice and it really reaches my G-Spot, but I must say it is just not a dick and woooooo do I like me a real dick."
3,Not strong. But good.,I tried this and it's not that strong. I would suggest finding something else. It feels good when inserting it but if you want it more for vibrations then find another product. The 3 stars is for the feeling.
2,Too noisy!,Vibration strength is just OK and it is very loud and distracting. Does not make for a relaxing experience.
2,Noisy,"Very noisy device. I also dislike that when you press the button, it turns on at the fastest rate and subsequent pushes go down."
4,Riding the Bible belt with a Borscht belt sense of humor,"From Cross To Cross is one Hell of a ride. The actual motorcycle trip being just the skeleton for the trip he takes in his mind.The author has a wonderful way with words, and relates some very funny stories all the while questioning his life as a Jew in the Christian world.I enjoyed the read. I laughed out loud in many places and I'm hearing his questions over and over in my own head as if they were my own.I recommend From Cross To Cross no matter your religious belief or your ethnic background."
1,Couldn't even get out of the parking lot...,"At first I was enjoying the book but, after what seemed an endless diatribe against Christians, I couldn't force myself to endure this for the journey. Time would be better spent reading a more balanced motorcycle book like ""The Old Man and the Harley."""
4,Review,Cd was very late. But once I emailed and told them what was going on they were very quick about fixing the problem and getting the cd to me. I appreciate the speedy customer service.
3,The Whole Truth,"I wonder how much of this story is based upon actual events that took place back in the 70 time frame. But, it was an interesting read."
1,PIRATE DVD,"This is a pirate release of the video ""Amália Rodrigues, Live in New York City"". If you like to buy this video I recommend that you purchase the VHS version distributed in the US by Kultur-Whitestar and in Europe by EMI Music or wait for the actual legal US DVD release.Bruno de AlmeidaProducer-Director"
2,not accurate,"Maybe it's because this book is now 2 years old, but my husband and I just came back from 11 days in Ecuador and felt it necessary to report that we hated this book. The price listings were usually off by 10-25%, and the reviews of various restaurants were inaccurate. We also found the book somewhat difficult to use. After staying at a relative's condo and finding a different guide book there, it became all the more apparent how frustrating this book was. Nevertheless, sometimes it was accurate, so I still give it a couple stars... and it's important to bear in mind that one's personal preferences might not always jibe with the authors.We did find that more than once the book would refer to something on another page and then that whatever we were looking for wasn't on the specified page. Maybe related to the various versions/updating, but irritating all the same.I do NOT recommend this book."
5,Great comprehensive Sharks book,Thorough coverage of this San Jose Sharks season from the SJ director of media relations. Very good pictures and statistics.
3,"More tribal than vocal, but still pretty pumpin","Aside from a handful of peak hour anthems like Some Lovin, Real Love, Love Revolution, You Make Me Feel Good and an impressive modern remix of Sylvester's ""You Make Me Feel Mighty Real,"" many of these tracks are darker, more tribal, and with splashes of vocal mixed down. But the pacing is well done so it doesn't suffer from too much repetitive beats. Perhaps some of the tribal tracks could have been shorter durations and more time given to shorter vocal tracks. Track times are:1. feel so right (7:12)2. Some lovin (5:43)3. Together (4:22)4. Overdrive (3:31)5. Let the feeling go (5:58)6. That sound (7:53)7. You make me feel good (6:13)8. Zumba E (4:12)9. No more (5:54)10. You (4:25)11. Real Love (6:36)12. Love Revolution (8:33)13. You make Me Feel Mighty Real (6:45)"
4,"Nice Fence, Straight as an Arrow",Once I got it set up it cuts straighter than any fence I have had before. Very easy to setup and adjust to true with the saw.
4,Vega Pro 50,"The product adapted very easily to a model 34-450 Delta Unisaw. The instructions are fairly straight forward, but here are a few things that are suggested for a better and easier install. Suggested when installing the back rail to purchase two 2 1/2"" X 24 bolts from your local hardware or big box store, this keeps you from having to remove the table on the saw. The product would be five stars but the finishing craftsmanship is not done on the fence mounting hardware. (Ex. The burrs have to be filed down for proper fit and alignment.) Suggest that after filing burrs to use furniture wax to keep oxidation at a minimum. Great upgrade from the standard factory fence."
3,"Works well, not a lot of fragrance","I really like this Shampoo but I only gave it 3 stars because it is not very practical.While it does wash well, I don't believe it washes that much better than much cheaper brands I have used in the past. It also does not have a fragrance really. I actually like that because I don't like overpowering fragrances but for some that may be a reason to purchase a different brand.I may re-order this product again, however, for those who are expecting a big step up from the cheaper brands you are already using, this is not the product for you."
3,"Don't expect 18""","I just received my 18"" cable. It looked a little short so I measured it. From tip to tip, it's 17 3/4"". The cable itself is 15 3/4"", and it's not at all flexible (actually flexible in one direction only. Imagine a piece of Romex 12 gauge house wiring that's flat). So if your application needs more than about a foot, you're better off getting a longer length.I'd exchange it, but for $11.50, it's not worth the trouble (even though Amazon would probably do it at no charge).But before ordering make sure that a shorter cable will work for you.Other than that its got an eSata male 7 pin plug on each end, and is what you need to attach an external drive to a TiVo Series 3 (if you don't use TiVo's Expander, which comes with a cable). If you have an HD TiVo (not a Series 3), only their external drive will work without hacking the software."
3,Works as advertised,"This ESATA cable works as advertised. I was looking for a short cable and this did the trick.The cable is slightly stiff, and hence based on your application can be a good or bad thing... in my case, I can bend it to the contour I want and it stays put."
1,NOT eSATA,"A number of vendors are confused by the SATA cables. The eSATA is different from the internal SATA cable. This particular cable, although listed as 7-pin ESATA is actually the internal cable, 6-pin. It will not fit in the eSATA connectors."
1,TERRIBLE,THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST CD THAT I HAVE PURCHASED.THE QUALITY IS VERY BAD.IAM VERY MUCH SURPRIZED THAT ANDY AND THE GRAN COMBO COULD PUT OUT SUCH A TERRIBLE CD.
1,Buyer beware,"Bad news, Robben Ford fans, this is not a new CD by the master blues guitarist, it's a re-issue of a CD that in an earlier incarnation was entitled ""Blues Connotation"", and even then this product was mislabelled as a Robben Ford project when in fact it's taken from recordings of the late '80s and early '90s led by a drummer named Jerry Granelli, and if you search ""Jerry Granelli"" here on Amazon for his CDs, you'll find these same tracks listed on one of Granelli's CDs under an entirely different title. Robben and the other stellar players listed on this recording (Charlie Haden, Bill Frisell, Kenny Garrett, etc.) were obviously drafted as guns-for-hire on the date, but despite the plethora of talent here, the music itself is criminally boring. It sounds like everyone started noodling in the studio hoping something would happen, but these arrangements and the choice of material will put you to sleep. I seriously doubt this is a Robben Ford-approved reissue. Save your cash."
4,Smoke-filled room full 'o jazz.,"Having seen McCoy Tyner and Ron Carter years ago at the Keystone Corner in San Francisco, this takes me back there. Sure, it's not what everyone would expect from a Robben Ford CD, but Robben's never been one to stick with a formula. That's probably hurt his overall volume, but this man's passion and exploration is undisputable. I think the other reviewers are far too harsh. Robben is not *just* a blues player. He played with Miles Davis for crying out loud. I'm not all that impressed with the production quality, as it's a bit thin. But, the performances are solid. Anyway, as a side note, I'd really like to see a live offering from Robben. I've seen him probably two dozen times over the past 3 decades, and I've been blown off my chair at every show. The man is quite simply, the best to ever hold a guitar."
1,All Is Not Well,"If Robben Ford could put out a CD that could turn off his followers,this is it.It don't make a lick of sense.Surly,the other reviewer is onto something."
3,Hard to warm to this...,"Up to this release, there was always something to Laurie Anderson's releases that seemed to emphasize a connection to the listener and/or their experiences. But ""Bright Red"" seems to be much more about dis/misconnection...and somehow, this thematic imperative has gotten into the works here to the point that I, myself, have some real trouble listening to this one. Maybe there's something that's rubbing me the wrong way here, or maybe Laurie's doing her job a bit _too_ well in communicating the underlying themes. At any rate, this also marks something of a return to a more stripped-down style, more akin to her early work, yet retaining some of the pop complexity of later albums in the playing. I just couldn't connect with this, though...and it doesn't seem to want to connect with me."
3,Brief but concise,This is a short book about the Prophet Jesus in Qur'an. Author refers to ayats from Qur'an and explains how Prophet Jesus is mentioned in the Qur'an versus the current Christian belief which is mostly in contradiction with Islam. It is double line printed short book and Author made it easy to read with clear logic. Naturally assumption is made that the Qur'an is correct and no importance is given to hadits relating to the issue and therefore the conclusions are clear and without any doubt. Book is definetely worth to read.
2,Jesus Died on Earth : The point is missed in the book,"The book writes in detail trying to justify that Jesus did not die and that he was raised alive. The author is bound in his own domain and could not comprehend the teaching of Islam. If Jesus was raised ""to Allah"" - does Allah have a physical body towards which He raised Jesus? The verse 3:54 clearly says Allah will cause Jesus's death before he can be raised. Death must happen before he can be raised in any manner. The book misses this point. It reiterates Hadith to claim that Jesus is alive - but Quran specifically said he is dead. If not, then Quran is full of contradiction. All scholars agree the meaning of ""wafat"" is death but in this verse they disagree! I recommend you read a web site www.geocities.com/Athens/Cyprus/8878 to know what may have happened to Jesus. I neither recommend nor discourage anybody from reading this book. Allah has given you mind and intelligence to be your own judge."
2,A Visitor from Virginia earlier posted,"I was surprised to see a visitor who earlier posted the message saying the Quran mentions that Jesus(May Peace be on Him) had a father. Which is absolutely False & Vulgar. Quran is the only Book to make us belive that Jesus was born Miraculously in Surah Maryam, even the modern day christians drops the idea of the miraculous birth. No muslim is a muslim if he does not beileve in the Miraculous birth of Jesus."
2,Functional i guess,"Kindof a puny beep sound like a motor scooter. I guess it works though, and seems pretty water resistant. not great though"
3,Not loud enough,"We installed this horn to replace an existing horn and it does not seem loud enough to me. Its mounted at the front of the boat under the bow. If I'm driving the boat I can barely hear it. I've asked people ahead of us if they can hear it, and they can, but I'm not sure someone in a boat with a loud engine would hear it in an emergency. The sound is very high pitched. I intend to replace this as soon as I can find a horn that fits the current hole (even this one is smaller than the original horn) but at least I am legal until then."
3,Music is Good but sound Quality terrible,"Love the Music, but the sound quality kinda kills it. It's still a good cd just not worth the price, plus when I am trying to relax and a bunch of distortion comes out of my speakers, it tends to disturb me out of my state of mind"
2,Some truth in advertising woudn't hurt here ...................,"This is not a yoga cd. It is a Dharma Moon sampler dressed up as a yoga cd. 4 out of 8 tracks were on yet to be released Dharma Moon cds (one cd, ""Cosmic Oasis"", never released as far as I can tell) and one track (Opening The Gates) was credited to a coming cd when in fact it was on a previous release, which probably meant a lot of people bought the wrong cd. So this cd is really just a faulty sales tool, as other unhappy buyers have found out the hard way.""Opening The Gates"" (from ""Drala"") and ""Indian Nights"" (from the Steve Gorn album ""Colors Of The Mind"") are nice meditative tracks, but the best thing on the album is ""Nagual"" by Michael Hewett from ""Being In Dreaming"". Forget the rest."
5,Excellent seller,"Upon learning that I was unhappy with the color I received and that I was not able to choose a color, Arizona Sun contacted me and sent me a second bath puff in a color I chose at no extra cost. I really didnt want them to go to that much trouble, but they insisted. Great customer service is hard to find and much appreciated. THANK YOU ARIZONA SUN. By the way, the puff is full, well made, not dinky like the discount store versions."
3,Excellent music but where are the liner notes?????,Philips and Lars Roos as the pianist have done great service in collating these miniatures into one CD. It is very unfortunate that there are no liner notes detailing the history of each piece and its background. Marco Polo or Naxos would have done a better job of packaging these gems.
4,The best out there,This is the best Analysis book I have come across. They give you just enough examples to get the hang of it. I use it primarily as a reference tool for theorems.
2,Introduction to real analysis,"In my opinion this book is not great but I don't think it is horrible either. It does a pretty decent job on sequences for all other topics I would reccomend a supplement or a schuams outline for advanced calculus.I also warn anyone taking this course for the first time and using this text that in order to successfully use this book a strong mathematical background is needed. It is imperative that you grasp key concepts such as induction, and set theory. And even have a basic knowledge of calculus. If you have any holes in those areas they will quickly show. So make sure you have a solid foundation before continuing your studies in mathematics."
3,A concise and to-the-point Real Analysis book,"~I am a non-Math undergraduate but Finance graduate . I found this book quite concise and useful . Mathematical concept are developed in a systematic way and are not too difficult to catch. Graduate Student in Finance may find this book useful to help them develop essential real analysis skills before they move on to study other probability / integration / measure / mathematical finance theory .However , hints for exercise is not enough , this may create a problem for some beginning~~ undergraduate maths student.~"
5,Masterpiece,This is a coherent piece of work. Presentation is crisp. Techniques of proof are rigourous. You need a touch of mathematical mutarity and an informal background in calculus to appreciate the treasures hidden in the pages of this book.
2,Not for the first course in Real Analysis,"I cannot recommend this book to beginners. Its hard to understand, and there are very few examples. The only good thing is maybe, that beginners get an intuitive feel of integration, and the underlying ideas, thats all.Certainly not what an undergraduate needs. Apostol's book is much better."
5,One of the best introductions to Real Analysis Available,"Introduction to Real Analysis by Bartle, et al. is among the finest introductions to Real Analysis on the market. It was the book that first introduced me to ""higher mathematics"" and it's style is clear, concise and at a level appropriate for anyone who has just finished their first course in calculus. Highly recommended for either self study or as a first textbook in real analysis, 5 out of 5 stars."
2,Not that good,"i am actually taking a real analysis course, and this is my first encounter with real analysis. I actually find it very hard to understand the contents and i do not recommend this book for real beginners that want to study real analysis."
5,Real Analysis,"This book came in great condition. It looks brand new, no marks, and half the price as anywhere else I could find."
1,Save your devaluing dollars,"An extremely frustrating book to read due to the author stretching what should be one or two chapters into a full book by repeating the same points over and over and over. After suffering through to the end, not one new or interesting idea that you would not have not already envountered by reading the business/investing section of a decent newspaper or The Economist.Honestly, one of the worst books, financial or otherwise, I ever read in my life."
1,Waste of time and money,This book contained very little that is not common knowledge. Especially disappointing was the lack of original investment ideas. Even if one accepts the premise there is little in the way of useful investment strategy.
1,Simplistic Garbage,"The author has absolutely NO understanding of global economics or production. This book reads as though it was written by a high school student, and isn't worth the paper it's printed on. If you really want to understand global economics and currency issues, get ""Making Sense of the Dollar"", by Marc Chandler. It was written by an adult, for adults."
2,More Actionable Advice would improve the book,"The author goes to great lengths, quite successfully, to explain why the country finds itself with the challenges that it does. Very educational. Very important.However, more actionable advice about what to do about this problem would improve the book immensely. How should you evaluate, in greater detail, the various Gold ETF's, the various gold mining companies, and determine when you were purchasing these sectors/companies at P/E's that increased your overall risk rather than lowering it.In other words, how do you know you are buying the recommended investments at the proper time, vs when they are overblown in valuations?Another two chapters on that would have helped.Still the history and background is interesting, and worth a read."
2,The Demise of the dollar,"While I agree with the author on the subject of this book, it offered little more information than most of the other books I've recently read about our economy."
4,The Demise of the Dollar ...,"There are actual laws that govern the subject of economics and this book does a superb job of presenting the true facts allowing one to actually view what is going on with our economyand related to other world economies. There is no question in my mind that the trends identified WILL unfold or continue as Mr. Wiggin states, just as surely as the sun will rise in the morning. He presents a very clear picture, minus the noise that those with other agendas use to cloud the issues."
1,Not much new and not very helpful,"Maybe I expected too much. I would say give a couple of chapters on how things are terrible and the dollar is worth nothing, then use the rest of the book giving investment advice. Unfortunately, he did just the opposite, pounding us over the head for chapter after chapter about the dollar and debt and all the other bad things that are happening. Very little specific investment advice. Skip it."
2,Financial Reckoning Day Redux,"A rehash of his ""Financial Reckoning Day"" and if you ordered via Amazon.com you received a six page email invitation to subscribe to an options trading financial newsletter."
4,Wig out with Addison Wiggin,"Though not nearly as fun to read as Empire of Debt, it's an excellent read about the current state of affairs in the US. This is a no-nonsense, un-shellacked account of the US economy and answers some of those questions we all have floating around in our heads (such as: The media and government say the economy is doing great but why does it seem like I have less money to live on each year?) If you're feeling depressed lately, you may want to put this one aside for awhile. But if you desire to learn how to profit from the current US slide, pick it up."
1,Wiggin is a deceitful cheat!,"I was dumb enuf to pay for a book that was nothing more than a come-on (marketing tool) for the host of Agora newsletters, etc. he publishes. There was nothing, repeat nothing new in the book. The only part slightly of value was a list of types of investments to consider. And he gave that chapter away a few days later in ""The Daily Reckoning"". He just collected a bunch of short essays (read chapters) already published for free, called it a book, hyped it, and got suckers like me to buy it. What a waste of time--and money! Never again!"
3,Less words please,"This writing team likes to take a subject and work it into a full length book by repeating the same theme endlessly. They should have created a long magazine piece or a booklet, but as financial wizards they know where the money is. Nevertheless, this book and its subject may save you a fortune if the demise of the dollar occurs."
3,The Demise of the Dollar,"I don't agree with the author on all the points he made, but it did point out a lot of the reasons the dollar is getting weaker vs other countries money."
4,In progress of reading the book,I am just in the progress of reading the book. Sofar very interesting and useful
1,You'll Be Okay,"Don't worry about the United States as long as you can make money! You can have the same attitude as the wealthy. Don't trouble yourself by reading history about the collapse of the Roman Empire, you don't need that type of guilt. Remember, it's all about you! Be a scavenger like Wiggin and feed off the host until you kill it. Call me corny or sentimental, but I do care about our country and there are plenty of ways to make a profit without ruining America."
2,Let's whine about Nixon,"So, the book could have easily been two chapters: 1) a brief history of how we (both the U.S. and the world economy) got where we are today; 2) how to invest now.Instead, it seemed like a non-stop tirade against Nixon and and the U.S.'s abandonment of the gold-standard for our currency. Ok, we get the picture. And, you know what, that was over 30 years ago. Get on with it and get to the investment advice. Unfortunately, there was no new information in this book that I found helpful. The scant investment advice in the last chapter was either common sense hedging advice or standard bearish investing advice.Sorry, but this was a waste of my time. However, if I had instead invested the cost of the book and could earn 8% annually until I retire in 30 years..."
3,Demise of the Dollar,I found the book to be very good in historical background information. The solution Mr. Wiggins supports to protect our personal finances is very logical and I find I have already done some and will most certainly do some of his other suggestions.John Brunk
3,Demise of the Dollar Review.,"Informative, a good primer for anyone interested in our currency-the dollar. Explains what is happening/being done to the US dollar by example,showing what happened to other countries who followed a similar path with their currency. An excellent start for anyone interested in where the US is headed financially,and who wants to profit from that knowledge."
2,Summary of negatives for dollar,"This book was repititious as though repeating the same information over and over gave it more credibility. By the last 1/3, you were reading paraphrasing. The solution to the demise seemed to depend on gold as alternative with vague references to options. This doesn't compare to the specific ideas in Conquer the Crash by Prechter. This book could have benefitted from good editing and pruning."
4,THE DEMISE OF THE DOLLAR,"THIS IS AGOOD FINANCIAL INVESTMENT BOOK ,HOW YOU CAN PREPARE YOURSELF FOR THE FUTURE, BY PROTECTING YOUR INVESTMENTS."
2,The Demise of the Dollar - A Repititious Saga,"I read the book right through and found that most of what was said on the current state and direction of the US economy could be summarised in a couple of pages. Similarly with where to invest. That said it was interesting learning about the background to the current fiat money system and the demise of earlier monetary systems throughout history. With that knowledge and current events in Zimbabwe, and earlier in Thailand, Russia and Argentina helps investors realise that any monetary system can fail if enough people lose faith in the underlying value of its currency. Wiggins of course contends that the US thanks to Greenspan's irresponsible credit boom and debt levels is heading down the same path to destruction. Time will tell."
1,Rehash of Daily Reckoning,"If you read their free daily newsletter, The Daily Reckoning..this book offers nothing new. He makes a case for the collapse of the dollar and for buying gold...overall, I liked the Bull Hunter much better. It had some new ideas."
4,Worrisome,I would like to consider the book as a fair warning. I gave it to members of my family for their reading.
2,Don't Believe Much of It!,"This is an opinionated fisco-political conservative pretending he can predict the future. They and their calamitous psuedoinsights are $.10 a ton. One wonders why they chose to make a living trying to make economic predictions instead of, say, religion? Many would like to know about the second (some say first) coming, for instance."
