1,this is a terrible translation!,really not worth the space on your kindle. it completely fails to capture the beauty of the original. DO NOT download!
3,"Great story, bad spelling","This book is cheap, and after reading it I noticed why, there are quite a number of spelling errors. It doesn't really detract from the quality of the story, but it is a bit annoying. I guess beggars can't be choosers."
4,Fantastic novel,"The novel is a bildungsroman, set in the oriental part of the world during the times of Gautama Buddha. A young protagonist sets out on a spiritual adventure initially joining a group of sramanas. The story unfolds his experiences that lead him gradually to higher levels of knowledge, during the course of which he finds himself fully engrossed in worldly pleasures of gambling, sex and fatherhood, liberating himself from which he rises to an even higher level of self-realization. Contrasting his journey with that of his childhood friend Govinda who is in the same pursuit, Herman conveys that one has to discover own's path towards this destination."
2,Great story Horrible presentation,A great piece of literature that I have read before. I had to give this Kindle edition a low rating simply because the editing was shamefully poor. Find another edition preferably from someone who cares about the product they tie their name to.
3,choose your edition carefully,"This book shows the futility of the 5 star ranking system. How to I rate this? On the one hand, it's a classic and offers all sorts of fascinating philosophical insights. On the other hand, it's a translation and hence it's hard to judge as an original work given my lack of German. On the other hand (well, if I were Kali I'd have another hand), it's a book that I think a lot of people wouldn't particularly enjoy, and that I enjoyed only because I was in a certain sort of mood while reading it. In the end, I pick three stars, simply to say that it's got certain qualities, but it's not something to pick up entirely at random. And if you do, pick up a reliable translation rather than finding it free on Kindle..."
2,Lukewarm at best,"I bought ""Batting A Thousand"" for my son and was unimpressed. There were a few good tips, but too much time was spent on worthless topics -- batting gloves, some people like them, some don't. Not much help. They didn't show anything about the stance, lining up with the plate, or how to pick up the flight of the pitch. This may be the best video out there, but my son and I were both hoping for something with more useful information."
4,Suprisingly refreshing instruction!,"I was a little skeptical about having actual pros give our little 5 year old advice through a TV screen, but just seconds after the tape was over he was asking if we could go paractice like the pros on the tape showed him. Way to go D&D!"
2,"Lightweight, Ignores History, Without Useful Sources","This is a simple-minded book that manages to obscure the basics with convoluted language. It also achieves a remarkable feat, failing to mention history as a relevant factor in understanding and anticipating ethnic conflict in the 21st Century. It does nothing whatsover to suggest to the interested analyst, for whom this ""template"" was designed, how to operationalize the few relevant factors the book identifies, and does not provide any discussion at all of sources and methods helpful to studying ethnic conflict. There is no bibliography and no index. The footnotes are lightweight."
4,Autocad 2002 No Experience Required,"My bro-in-law asked me to order two books, this book and Autocad 2002 for Dummies. He made the comment that this book was better for him than the other. He has had a learning disability of sorts since school days and this seemed to be easier to understand."
5,Definately Getcha Some!,"This is a much awaited release! Too often people have favorite songs and don't realize they are by Toby Keith! This release for the six time BMI Songwriter Awards winner is a must have for all country fans, after all eight of these songs went all the way to number one! Lots of toe tapping and singing along with this one!"
5,a Ton Of HITS,this is by far on of the best cds i've ever bought. The songs on remind me of the good old days when country was played on country stations not pop stations.
5,This much awaited album is long overdue..!!,Toby Keith has been blasting the charts with all the hits you can hear on this album. Toby's voice is one that will be around for a while. This album is just a mixture of talent and then some. I'm looking forward to a volume two. This album is a treasure of Toby's #1's and is a milestone in his and his fans lives! Way to go Toby!
4,"IT RULES! Especially ""Getcha Some""","Its a really kewl cd. Or as Marcia Brady would say,""Its Groovy!&quot"
2,When Toby was tolerable,"I've never been a Toby Keith fan, but I could tolerate him during the period covered in this collection. At least here, he hurt sometimes, showed a little deep feeling, and didn't show such a huge ego. Then he switched labels and became the nasty, malicious ""Howdya like me NOW?"" creep he is today. I liked him better when he was ""Leashed"" a little."
3,Not the same as other NO-AD sunscreens,"I believe this sunscreen was intended for the latin market, as it has both English and Spanish text on the front and back. For some reason avobenzone is not listed as an ingredient, while it is in typical NO-AD SPF 30 bottles. For this reason I would not buy this specific packaging again, and will make sure to confirm that avobenzone is an ingredient in the future."
3,Elastic is different in one pack. Packing is Not consistent...,"I bought a few ""packs"" and one was similar but different, smaller elastic. The normal packs are great but the smaller elastic ones don't seem as well made... I am now unsure if that was a packing issue or not since the plastic on each pack was identical in every way..."
2,Too big,"They say that they are bikini sized, but really, they are enormous. They are not bikini sized. I couldn't wear them at all. I got a size small, and I wear a size 5 in pants, and they were wayyyy too big. They should let you know that they are not the same underwear that is pictured on the model"
3,alot of shrinkage,"fit great at first. Then shrank too much to wear anymore. i suggest getting one larger size. I found the Hanes ""no ride up"" bikini is going through the wash with no apparent shrinking....still fit fine. So maybe you can try that? overall: both are among the better panties I have found. Just get one bigger size to allow for repetitive hot water wash and dry."
2,bad fit,"Would love these panties if they were cut correctly. In the pack I purchased, there were only two pair that actually fit right. The rest had one leg hole that was much larger than the other."
2,Inconsistent Fit,"I own these but I don't wear them anymore, nor will I be buying more in the future. While they're very soft and come in pretty patterns, they don't stay put despite their claims. They don't have a very full coverage in the buttocks, which then leads to shifting and having to manually put them back into place. Sort of defeats the purpose of buying a ""wedgie free"" panty. My biggest complaint however, is that without fail, at least 1-2 pair in each pack is cut oddly or much smaller than the rest. Leaving me no choice other than to throw the pair(s) away. They don't do what they promise, and they cause me to waste money by having to discard brand new panties. Not a bargain in my opinion."
4,"I love this underwear, but only if I buy them directly from Hanes","I have purchased several packs of these underwear over the last 2-3 years. They are 100% cotton and stay in place both of which are important if you have sensitive skin. HOWEVER, I've bought all but one pack directly from Hanes online. The most recent pack i purchased through Amazon (through one of their vendors as they don't sell it directly), and although the package was not marked as such, it was clear that these were factory ""seconds."" Three of the six pairs are much smaller than the others and i will have to throw them away! It seems other commenters have had the same experience.Although i love the convenience of Amazon, I will buy these from directly Hanes next time."
5,Mama Knows,"I purchased this for my Mama who is 90.5 years of age. She had never heard him; however, my oldest brother (deceased) had told her about him. she had mentioned him on one of my visits with her, so I ordered it for her to enjoy. By the way, she is almost totally blind due to macular degeneration and music and listening to TV gospel preachers is ALL her entertainment now. Anyway, she LOVES him and even recommended this I buy this for myself. Thanks to him and Amazon, I can keep her entertained."
2,not as advertised,Used the product just to attach crown molding to blinds and it would not hold. Did not stay attached even in indoor conditions.
3,"Haven't figured out any ""heavy duty"" properties","This is generous 2 sided mounting tape, with no special capacities, dunno why it is labeled as ""heavy duty"", average $1 tape from dollarstore does exactly the same, so this item is heavily overpriced."
2,Havey duty tape,"Not worth the money, it only last for a few days; for me anyway.I put in on a clean dry surface.I would not buy this tape again!!"
2,Need a new paint job...,They hold up great...but when it came time for me to move out they ripped the paint-every layer of white paint-off of my bedroom walls. I even tried using a knife to help get the adhesive off without damaging the wall...this did not work. Use with caution.
4,A penny saved....,"This CD happens to have the same tracks as Legends of Acid Jazz:Track ListingsBlack Rhythm Revolution:1. Express Yourself2. Soulful Drums3. Super Bad4. Wander5. By the Red SeaPeace & Rhythm:6. Peace and Rhythm Suite: Peace7. Peace and Rhythm Suite: Rhythm8. Brother You Know You're Doing Wrong9. Don't Knock My Love10. I'm a BelieverFor a few dollars ""less, buy Idris' ""Legends of Acid Jazz,"" if it is still available.I must note the two ""original albums"" these selections came from were both excellent (I still have them, although somewhat scratched, but still playable). I am exceptionally fond of ""I'm a Believer."" As far as drummers go, Idris and Harvey Mason (Donald Byrd's Lansanna's Priestess amongst many others) have been two of my favorite drummers of that period."
2,"This was terrible even for the 70's, asks us to believe that","the beautiful Joan Van Ark (pre-Knots Landing) falls for boozey old macho Richard Boone,icky pooh. Don't believe the good reviews, Get Gargoyles instead, much better movie, better acting, better storyline.It's a matter of taste, I know, but really I wanted the Dinosaur to kick the crap out of Boone."
5,Terrific viewing!,"First of all let's get the special effects thing straight.....they are good for the time (it wasn't made in 2000 you know) The storyline is unique and exciting and Richard Boone delivers. It as action, drama, romance and everything you could want. My recomendation.....OWN IT!!"
2,"Fun Flick, Poor Quality Tape","The movie is a blast--never saw the end as a kid--but I'm disappointed that it's in EP mode on VHS which lowers the video and audio quality. I purchased it throught Amazon.com, and I think that this fact (extended play mode), should have been revealed. At times the clicking, popping, and hissing of the soundtrack made it sound like the movie was made 45 years earlier."
3,Dinosaurs in the Closet,"I thoroughly enjoy watching this type of bad cinema, so when I saw this stinker (re-released during the ""Jurassic Park"" era), I knew I had to order it for my collection. When my copy finally arrived, I rushed it to the VCR and insisted that my wife watch it with me. My favorite scene is when the eminent Dr. Yamamoto turns around to find that a 5 ton dinosaur has snuck up on him! That scene could have been believable if the dino had surprised Richard Boone, who was convincingly incoherent throughout the film.My wife's unforgettable scene came near the end, when the U.S. Navy was attempting to retrieve the Polar Borer and crew. ""That's Uncle Don!"", she screamed in horror. Apparently, while working in Japan, her uncle was offered a bit part in the movie. His fee... third billing on the credits!This is a fun movie... and it stars Uncle Don!"
4,fun and entertaining !!!,Ok! so dinosaur is'nt that good and looks awful...and the special effects are low budget. But it still a fun and intertaining movie to wacht on a rainy day.
2,The best scene was edited!!!!,"I saw this movie on television back in the day and enjoyed it. I found a VHS tape in K-mart 20 years ago and my kids enjoyed it growing up. I lost track of that video, so ordered this one recently. The quality is acceptable, but the best scene of the movie is missing!!!! At the very end, Joan van Arc says, ""It the last dinosaur, the last one"", and Richard Boone says, ""So am I"" - that scene is completely missing from this version of the movie. What a let-down!"
4,Blast from the past.,"A good plot and well-developed character highlight this Japanese/American co-production. Richard Boone is particularly good as the cantankerous Maston, a rich hunter who is on the trail of the last tyrannosaurus on Earth. His hell-bent determination to kill this creature forms the very center of the film's story and brings a welcome depth to what could have been a brainless time waster. The other characters are thankfully more than just dumb dino bait. The spfx are very well done for the time(Of course, digital technology has caused leaps in effects work but, a film must be evaluated in the context of when it was made!). All-in-all, this is a graet movie that is as thought provoking as it is entertaining."
3,Great Cheesy Campy '70's bad special effects and acting movie! You will love it.,"I remember watching this movie on tv as a kid and just loving it. Saw it on amazon and just had to have it for my collection. Not a great artistic work by any stretch, just a fun bad '70's sci-fi movie. Enjoy it!"
2,Almost Satisfactory,"First the bad points: Fine tuning the table height is very frustrating. The arm that you loosen then tighten is set akwardly on the left. Furthermore, you either have to rock the table back and fourth to get it lower, or it just drops down, so much for fine tuning. The table that you place your work on is small. If you're working on anything of any size, it's difficult to clamp. Finally, there's no mortising attachment available.The good points: It's a solid machine that will make good holes for a long time. It's just the set up that's misery.I should have spent the extra [money], and bought the Delta 12"" Drill Press. The 12"" model has a crank to adjust the table height, the table is bigger, and a mortising attachment is available."
2,You lost me at Hello,There are some decent techniques taught in this video but the guy who narrates it is so dry and boring and does not speak fluidly about the processes. He repeats himself and takes 5 times as long to explain things as it should take. Not really worth the money.
2,Too hard,I used to use this kind of bamboo brush in China. But this one was way too hard. It felt like a stick rather than a brush. I did not like it.
3,Okay product but I was sent the wrong size,"I ordered several of the 7"" cleaning whisk and was sent only one and the others were the larger 10"". The larger size is too big to handle for what I needed. The other problem with these whisks is they don't hold up for very long. They are fairly inexpensive though so it's not that big of a deal. I use these to clean out my cast iron skillets and they work great for that because they don't scrape off the seasoning."
3,Cleans Well,"The bamboo cleaning whisk works very well at cleaning a wok after use, but it doesn't last very long. I may be a bit heavy-handed with it, but the wood seems to shatter and splinter faster than I would have expected. I will be looking for something more durable in the future."
3,Rating depends on what color you choose,"I bought the first time the Grey Heather and I really liked it. I would give the first one 4 stars.The Second time I bought the Chrome Blue and the material of the t-shirt is much lighter than the Grey one and it gets wrinkled very fast which is very weird. I give the second one 1 or 2 stars.My recommendation, Buy the Dark ones, They will probably be like the Grey one in terms of thickness and quality of the cloth."
2,not so great,these tee shirts look great when you first put them on but after washing them they seem to lose shape . i found better quality sloid color tee shirts elsewere .
1,WORST BOOK ON EARTH...SOMEBODY KILL ME,"i have to read this book for a school assignment and i want to kill myself. it is sooooo slow and boring, i want to strangle Pauline Gedge. Im 100% sure that this book couldnt get any worse...unless i actually had to read it."
4,River God Without the Blood,"River God is certainly one of my all-time favorites. Action, exciting characters - everything you look for in an adventure book. I wanted to look into other authors who write fictional accounts of my favorite period in history - ancient Egypt. I have not been disappointed. I loved the Hippo Marsh! In my opinion it is a book that focuses more on family rather than the testosterone-fueled River God. One thing I noticed is that Gedge throws in some terms that the casual reader might not be familiar with. Even I didn't know what Ma'at, ka, or ba were. I might suggest getting an inexpensive bargain book on ancient Egyptian culture or taking a tour through www.EternalEgypt.org for some definitions.Usually when these books are part of a series, I take a break after each one and read something else. I was left so enamored by the Tao family that I began reading the second one immediately! I highly recommend this book."
4,Great but....,"Its a great book... but its the middle of a definant trilogy. Hard to read the third if you've never read the middle and hard to not read the third after reading the middle. So if your going to invest in this one, invest in all 3."
1,Poorly Researched,"This is not a history book, it is fiction interwoven with incorrectly used facts. If you are interested in Wyoming history or Wyoming's prisons, go to the source. Visit the historic sites and ask for yourself."
3,"Ok gloves, not thrilled","These were ok. The fit was too big, I got a medium and have always been a medium in gloves and followed the size chart. The material looked very cheap, but it was warm enough for chilly weather. Not warm enough for cold weather. Not enough friction for driving, in my opinion. The fingers had strange bulky seams that probably should have been sewn differently. I do like that they have a small clip to keep them together and they arrived quickly. The price was cheap, so I was expecting cheap quality. However, with the added problem of inaccurate sizing and weird finger seams overall I was disappointed."
1,Very strong smell of Anise............uh no thanks!,"I bought this for a way understated price at a thrift store. I have never liked it from the day I bought it, but it was cheap! And after all it was Guerlain. How bad could it be! The anise smell is overpowering. There is claim to there being other scents involved, but all I can smell is the anise. It's hard to tell if it's a male fragrance or female. I don't mind a unisex fragrance, ie. love love love, Perry Ellis's America. I think it's the man's version that I wear. It's absolutely incredible! I am using this anise scent as a bathroom spray. Works for that!"
2,Revising the identity of technology,"A very thorough and easy read for beginners to start thinking what lies beyond the computing technology. This book may be similar with Gate's The Road Ahead, but does not intrigue much ecological vision into abstracting the craft."
4,Relaxing background.,"This isn't really one of his best. It was inspired by a trip through Europe, but none of it really has a European flavor--it's just more soft Lanz pieces. The improvisations are OK, but then, a lot of the actual compositions sound like improvisations too. Return to the Heart is a nice, soothing tune. My favorite was Dream of the Forgotten Child. Heartsounds, Corre Rio Corre, and his imrovisations on Pachelbel's Cannon make great relaxing background. If you want music that sort of floats through a room bringing peace and contentment, this is perfect. If you want something with more energy, try something else."
5,"Beautiful, pure piano music!","One of my favorite CDs. This is a great CD to listen to to calm the nerves and puts one in a happy, calm frame of mind! Wonderful!"
3,Petronas Towers are in Malaysia,"These twin towers have nothing to do with the World Trade Center twin towers so tragically destroyed on Sept. 11. This may be a good book (I haven't read it), but it's about buildings in Malaysia, not in New York City."
3,he Petronas Twin Towers: World's Tallest Building,I bought the wrong book! It has nice pictures!The Petronas Twin Towers: World's Tallest Building (Record-Breaking Structures)RHM
4,Understanding Family,"Having never read the censored version I cannot compare to this new edtion.However, I reccommend this book as a good read on family and loyalty. Sometimes it seems that there are two situations in which families with not so great histories are explored: 1. the child breaks free and leads a pretty good life or 2. the child becomes the parents. This story leans a bit more toward 1 than two but still shows how much family means even if the family is imperfect.The writing is simple and yet alluring. I enjoyed the setting and the characters too."
1,RAYMOND EDWARDS,"I WOULD RATHER BE READING LOUIE L'AMOUR, COMPTON , JOHNSTONE, OR COTTON. I PURCHASED 12 AT SAME TIME, HAVE READ ONE IN 2 MONTHS. GREY CANNOT HOLD YOU TO THE BOOK AND KEEP ON READING TO ME AS L'AMOUR DOES. I COULD READ 6 OR MORE OF ABOVE MENTIONED PER MONTH. TO ME PERSONALLY I CANNOT GET INTO GREY START OF BOOKS ARE TOO DRAWN OUT AND CANNOT GET THAT HOLD ON YOU THAT MAKES YOU NOT WANT TO PUT BOOK DOWN, IN HIS TIME BEFORE OTHERS HE WAS PROABLY OK BECAUSE THATS ABOUT ALL THERE WAS OF HIS KIND OF STORIES, BUT GIVE ME LOUIE L'AMOUR ANY DAY."
4,Soulful Christmas Album,"Most Christmas albums are nothing more than cash cows for record companies. This isn't the case with McKnight's Bethlehem which has an quiet storm feel to it even though it's R&B. Let It Snow 98 is a great follow up to the 1993 Boyz II Men classic. Religious Christmas songs like ""The First Noel,"" ""Hail Mary,"" ""Silent Night,"" and ""Bethlehem Tonight"" are mixed in with contemporary tracks such as ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,"" ""Home for the Holidays,"" ""Christmas Time Is Here,"" and ""Christmas Eve with You."" Overall, Bethlehem is a diverse collection of traditional and modern-day Christmas songs with something for everyone celebrating the season."
2,Great Singer - Mediocre Album,While I think Brian McKnight is a gifted singer - oroduction is weak. He seems to be ('till this point) one of those guys with alot of promise but no results. Perhaps he is circled by hangers-ons and family - he wouldn't be the first.The Christmas Song is patterned after Nat King Cole - even hurting that cut. Very disappointing. Would have gotten one star except he sings poor arrangements up a notch.
2,Waste of $$$$,"Waste of money for me. If you have never been to Disney before this book may be helpful to you. I have been several times with husband, friends, and adult family. We have our first trip coming up with our new family member - our 18mo little boy. The focus of this book is ""with Kids"". There was nothing of use to me in this book that anyone who has been to Disney even 1 time would not know already. Not much ""kid specific"" information. Disappointed. So if you've been to WDW before and are now taking your kids you should know everything in this book already. Good for 1st timers only."
5,This is my Bible to Disney World,"I have every edition of this book. Even now that my child is almost 17 I still purchased the book for our 2003 trip to Disney World. It is a great resource for families as well as adults traveling without kids. Not only does it come in handy to plan park visits, but we also rely on the information to select our Disney World hotel. The author has a great sense of humor which makes the reading fun!"
4,"Great character advancement, but a couple of bugs","As noted in other reviews, there are a few bugs, and the discussions surrounding Activision/Heuristic Park have been the most confusing thing I've ever seen in game playing. Who ever heard of a publisher reluctant to release a patch?? The gameplay, however, is fantastic. I've restarted the game on three different occassions and explored different character advancement strategies. The whole skill/magic advancement is very enjoyable -- there's a real sense of progress in this game. The dungeon crawls are fun; the puzzles tend to be pretty self-explanatory (not a whole lot of ""find the right pixel""). The journal/quest tracking mechanism could be better, and there are quite a few bugs, but overall this is the best game I've played in the last few years."
4,Pretty Good,"I was attracted to this game because it was by the same people that did the Wizardry series. I was not disappointed.While not quite as much fun as say Wizardry 8, this was still a pretty good game and I played it all the way to the end. I liked the first person party based perspective and liked that it was open ended like all the best games. Highly recommended."
4,RPG Fans Will Rejoice!,"This RPG is a lot like Dungeon Master, Dagerfall and Lands Of Lore, but the graphics for the monsters and locations look better, as does the changing sky as night approaches. You move up to six characters around a huge world by foot, horse, and boat meeting quest helping NPC's and fighting for your life. The interface is a bit clunky at first, the normal move with arrows and look with mouse combo is missing, also, you can only restore your position by quiting the game back to the town menu, where to save you must leave the town. Still, after you get used to the mechanics of the game I found myself having a lot of fun!"
3,"Overall, not a bad game","I bought this game and played it most of the way through (my computer crashed, not as a result of the game, just before I got to do Cet's pyramid.) The storyline is okay, the graphics and music are great. If you're a fan of the Might and Magic series, you'll like this game. There are a few things in the interface that are awkward, but you get used to them quickly enough, like Having to switch between different menus all the time to do things that should be on the same menu. There are also a lot of red herrings - active objects that give you a description when you mouse-over or click on them, but don't really do anything. Otherwise, the game is pretty good."
2,Nowhere Near As Good As 3M Command Mounting Strips,"These 3M mounting squares are nowhere near as good as3Ms Adhesive Strips.These ones really don't stick very well at all, and everything I've used them on, comes peeling off the wall and onto the floor. I haven't found a good use for these yet. Not sure what these excel at, but adhesion doesn't seem to be it. Won't buy again."
1,Don't buy this stuff!,"This stuff doesn't stick -- at least not anything I've attempted. With grandchildren I'm always looking for something to stick pictures, projects, decorations, etc., onto windows (mostly) or the fridge. Tired of the gummy stuff (tacky gum, or something like that) I thought this would be the answer. Well, I was wrong, and I've picked up and picked up various items that were supposed to be ""stuck,"" to the point of real annoyance. I won't buy it again, but am still looking for the perfect answer. If anyone has a reasonable solution, PLEASE post! In any event, save your money."
3,Not enough audio,"I think this is a poor choice for the total beginner. The audio starts with fairly advanced dialogue, spoken very quickly. While that may well be the way the Brazilians speak, it is useless to the beginning student. The book is comprehensive, but poor for self study - picture your high school Spanish text, without the teacher. I gave up on this one after two fruitless hours, and bought Pimsleur's Audio course. I may go back to Portuguese of Brazil - The Complete Course for Beginners, but only AFTER I finish Pimsleurs."
2,Horrible!,"This book would be a nightmare for a beginner because it jumps into Portuguese in such a confusing way. It just throws lists of words for you to memorize, and introduces grammar that is hardly even practiced in the exercises.This book is also very aloof, and hardly forms a ""relationship"" with the reader. All the explanations are not in-depth. New grammar and vocabulary is just explained with a sentence, and then the reader is left on his/her own.Here's an example of an exercise:Exercise 2Can you remember what the following are in Portuguese?duty-free, boarding card, departure board, non-smoking, passport control, departure lounge, departure gateNo, I can't remember what they are-all I was given was a list of words!Compared to Colloquial Icelandic(which is an EXCELLENT Colloquial course), this book is severely lacking, and that is quite surprising. A language spoken by around 200,000 people is taught so much more in depth than one spoken by almost 200,000,000!"
4,Colloquial Portuguese of Brazil,"Very helpfl book if you already have knoledge of Portuguese. Personally, I think the conversation on the CD's are very fast for someone who's trying to learn Portuguese as a begginer. I consider they should speak more slowly on the first lessons, at least.Over all, it's very helpful."
3,Good Drill Book,"I agree with the previous commentators. This a good drill and language decoding (reinforces semi-learned words and phrases) for the higher level beginner or intermediate student, but not for beginners."
2,Prepare to pay 5x cost to rebind it,"Useful little book for lovers of Green and McTeague, but the binding comes apart six pages into the first reading. Might as well Xerox a library copy."
5,The Best Exercise Book for all ages,"I bought this paperback book back in 1962 for the going price of $1.00 and over the years I have continued to follow it, not always to the maximum but it has been a wonderful help to keep me fit. It's the best!"
2,RCAF Exercises,"I was familiar with the book and its contents, so none of that came as a surprise.As for this particular purchase, the price was high and the condition of the book shabby."
4,Good looking movie,"This is a great Horror film. A too much blood and gore and some of the story line is a bit weak. The film is visually stunning and the action moves along well. I'm not really sure the twisted ending was needed; however, it ties much of the plot together. Not for the weak, but this film is great not just as a horror movie."
1,"Oh Lordy, what a waste of time","I understood the CGI as fake. Much like they did in 300. It's just a graphic prop, but besides that, I kept watching the clock waiting for it to get good or end. Not sure which. One of the most incomprehensible endings in cinema."
2,"Interesting, but the ending lost it for me","I purchased this movie because I read the short story so many years ago and just knew it would be great.The movie had it's really great scenes and on the whole would have kept me into it, but the ending just washed it all away. I was disappointed that a final finality was not used and the bizarreness of the end, was not to my liking.So, the movie was watchable, and it kept my attention, but the end was just too off track for my taste."
3,okay,I would have to say this was just ok. some parts gory & some parts enjoyable if you enjoy watching Bradley Cooper then it's worth seeing.
2,short story adaptation that is too long,"eveyone knows this is an adaptation of a clive barker short story. this would of made a great Masters of Horror series at an hour. i think the movie is way too long and stretched out. there is plenty of gore for the blood thirsty. not much at all for nudity, and the story line is much to thin for a full length movie. is it a great adaptation of a barker story? it's okay. barker movies are falling into the same tank as stephen king stories. for some reason, no one can get them right. i don't know why that is either. both authors are very visual, so their stories should translate to film easily enough. but for some reason they don't. this is worth a dvd rental, but nothing you want to own or will watch more than a couple of times at most."
3,cartoon blood,"A really decent movie whose story actually stands out and above all of the Saws and remakes in horror cinema's recent history. Personally, i think the silly story is refreshing, at least they didn't go the ol' split personality way. But, i do have 2 complaints.1. I CANNOT STAND CG. There is so much unnecessary CG in this movie. It obviously had quite a large budget, but they still couldn't get a few extra gallons of fake blood and a couple of decent props for the more violent scenes? And how hard is it to get an actual shot of the train going down the tunnel?2. Picture quality of the blu-ray. I've seen blu-ray versions of movies that came out 30 years ago with less grain than this one.first review ever!"
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"A gory, scary, horror film with an actual storyline! This movie should have been a can't miss and for the first hour it seemed that way. The movie progressed and it got weirder and weirder and then the ending just absolutely killed it."
2,"Started strong, ended weak","This Clive Barker adaption started off strong enough but had a weak ending. The concept itself was good but for some reason, something was just missing from the over all production.Technically, everything looked and sounded great. Decent acting and interesting sets kept me watching, but in the end I was left disappointed.Worth renting once, and there is a nice cameo by Ted Raimi for those paying attention!"
2,Saw this at the cheap movie theater for $3. . .,"and it would have been a complete waste of money, had it not been so hysterically funny. Seriously, it had it's moments, but most of the effects were just atrocious and some scenes were just plain idiotic. It was not in the least bit scary. All the CGI nonsense had the whole theater cracking up.Now I love Clive Barker. He is amazingly talented and I think that this film simply went awry and did not do justice to his source material. Go watch Hellraiser or Candyman instead."
2,Snowy,"Hi, I just dont get it i brought the Thing, Battle Los Angeles & Predator 2 the Blue ray is so pitcher perfect its like looking through a window at them i love those movis.Yet ! ""The Midnight Meat Train"" is snowy infact if you check your records you will see that i return one and i got another one yet the same way.Infact i still have the DVD but i don't watch it must due to snowy pitcher quality. It is a cory movie but its the snowy pitcher that turns me off."
1,Awful!,This movie was horrible! There was some potential at the beginning but by the time the creatures appeared I had checked out completely hoping for it to end.
2,How could this go wrong???,"I like the director, I love the author, I love Vinny Jones - all the pieces seem to fit! This film is a HUGE let down. The lead actor just ain't got the chops to carry the weight of the role and for some reason the Director who usually has a great, fast paced and stylized hand with the camera seems very flat and boring with his shot choices and angles in MMT. Not enough Jones, not enough tension or believable aspects to make this a good film AND way too much terrible looking CG blood. TERRIBLE special effects."
2,WTF?,"Really? With ~10 minutes to go in this run-of-the-mill psycho thriller/horror movie that was largely a variation on the rear window, they randomly throw in zombies? Really?? Frickin' zombies???? What a cheap ending! I was liking it right up until that point, and before that happened, I might actually have recommended it. But they had to make it another bleepin' zombie movie. Don't waste your time."
2,Nothing too Special,"While this movie starts out strong, it quickly lost me with it's very cartoonish and very BAD digital gore. Many of the other effects are terrible as well.It did do a good job of making you care about the romantic relationship, but you'll regret ever giving a damn because of the ending. All is lost and you're pissed you even started watching.The movie would've ended GREAT in it's third act instead of going into the outlandish fourth act, but I suppose that would've been ruining the source material.I think this would have played better as a thriller with most subtle gore and not such a hopeless, deary ending. I realize hopeless dreary endings are a horror film staple, but I guess as the movie progressed I was expecting more and something original.Definitely just a rental."
3,It's meat all over and it don't sound right,"Is a shame the audio of this blu-disc did not sound right in 5:1 dolby surround mode, otherwise it would certainly enhance the horror effect. You would not pay much attention to the video aspect as the movie is full of excessive bloodiness and gore that you would not want to fix your eyes on the screen for long."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!,"I was really excited about getting this for my husband birthday since he is from the US Virgin Island but the Product came in defective or dirty. The advertising is also Misleading. It says it a ""Mini Banner W/Brass Staff and Suctiom. Its clearly Plastic. Looks like a 2nd grader glued it together. Cheap Quality. Look better into Amazon. Their is a different seller that sells good quality mini banners."
4,Good reading,"Doukhan's book helped me to get over a hump in my learning of Hebrew. I initially taught myself BH, and there were times when Weingreen, Kelly, and others left me with questions. So, I plugged the hole with Doukhan ... until I discovered Bartelt's Fundamental Biblical Hebrew. Doukhan made very good reading, filled in a lot of blanks, and kept me plugging away at Hebrew when I flagged. It's not the best book on the market, but it is one worth reading."
5,Best Celtic CD Ever,"This is my absolute fav. celtic CD. I have had to buy it three times cause everyone loves it so much it keeps ""turning up missing"""
2,Hard to read,"Hard to read. Puts a strain on the eyes. Not as much fun as I thought it would be. If I had to do over again, I would not purchase this product."
4,pretty fun,"i like this game. i like doing the jumble in my daily newspaper, so this game comes in handy when i'm on vacation or just bored."
4,word games,game is small but the screen is large enough so you don't strain your eyes trying to play the game. It's great to pack for a car/air trip which is what I wanted it for. Seller shipped same day as it was ordered and rec'd within 2-3 days.
5,Jumble as you remember it!,"Simple! And at the same time, amazingly difficult. If you like how this one was rendered, suggest also trying another Parker Brothers treat, Yahtzee."
3,Hand held jumble,It is to small. It is hard to get tinto to change the battery. I thought it would be more like the one that I play on the computer.Chris Miller
1,Junk,What a piece of junk. You cannot slice onions really thin. It is more of a hassel than of any benefit. It came with no instructions to help you use it properly. It is going in the give away bag.
4,"Great job, just wish it were a little bigger","The product is handy, does what it is supposed to do (hold the vegetable so you can cut it into slices while keeping your hand out of the way). I just wish it were a little wider for larger items like onions, but otherwise it's great - cleans up well, is sturdy and useful."
4,Not exactly onion holder,"After using this to cut onions and tomatoes, I realized that this doesn't make things any easier. You still have those tears and all the sliminess. Inserting the knife between those prongs is trick. I should agree this makes cutting onions more fun.I found it more useful to cut long cucumbers or zucchinis into chips quickly."
1,Not impressed,Thought this would be a good way to avoid bloody fingers when slicing onions. Hard to push into onions and does not make consistent slices. I usually only got 2-3 decent slices per attempt so I no longer even bother to try to use it to slice an onion. I would like to be fair though and state that it does an ok job for thin tomato slices. That's the only thing that hss kept it out of the trash can. Only rated 1 star because it is listed as an onion holder.
2,Meh.,"While it's definitely an attractive product and I've gotten some use out of it, this Afro pick arrived smelling like onions."
1,Worse than a pig's ear,"This was without a doubt the WORST attempt at pretending to be a destroyer novel, I've ever read. I mean come on...Remo eating meat...Remo using a spear...Absolutly none of the wonderful anti-PC counterplay and ""no sacred cows"" that makes ""The Destroyer"" so much fun to read. My recommendation is to burn a $5 dollar bill.You will:1. Save the shipping2. Not have to read the novel3. Be able to say that you paid for the entire series"
1,Pathetic. This book was pathetic.,"There isn't really much to add to the already scathing reviews already here, so I am just adding my opinion for quantity. I can't figure out how the guy who rated this book a 4 rated it so high. 4 is giving this piece of trash way too much credit. It MIGHT have been a 4 as a stand alone book, but to anyone who follows this series, it is nothing less than an insult. Write to Gold Eagle and tell them what you think of what they have done to the series since Will Murray left as author."
2,Who wrote this book?,"Remo drinks coffee! He eats ""normal"" food! Thepolitical jabs are missing! Hopefully, this is notthe swan song for this series which, up to now, hasbeen one of the best sources of political satire todate. Cleverly disguised as a ""men's adventure""series, most of the books have scathing commentson the American political scene, lifetime USgovernment employees, and the American male machomystique. I'm hoping that #109 will be better."
4,History from the Kitchen,"Much more than a cookbook, Gunderson's book is a history lesson, sharing the words and thoughts of Lewis and Clark and how they managed their journey without the cooking conveniences we depend on today. The recipes are intriguing and easy-to-read and the journal entries make the book come alive. What a wonderful way to learn about Lewis and Clark - through cooking!"
4,I would take issue,"In answer to richardsimmons of Texas, I would say that my mother on numerous occasions made hominy -- which involves the use of lye. This was the classic treatment of dried corn used by the Indians (they made lye from wood ashes) and was important in releasing certain important nutritional elements in corn, making the protein available.Her inclusion of the recipe indicates that she does indeed know food history, and that is a key point in the value of this book.This is a beautiful, highly engrossing book; I love reading history, and this was thoroughly satisfying. She has linked the past through the personal diaries of Lewis and Clark with practices of the time and given us a notion of where our cuisine has gone.The content is highly accessible -- contemporary writing, writing contemporaneous with Lewis and Clark are done in parallel with the excerpts from the diaries, and the illustrations are wonderful."
5,"Clatsop County, Oregon: It's History, Legends and Industries","This book is an interesting read as well as a useful resource book on the topic of Clatsop County, Oregon. I especially enjoyed learning about the history of the town of Astoria, Oregon as well as of the contributions made by the many and varied immigrant groups which settled in this area over the years. Although a great deal of factual information is dealt with, it's presentation in this book is well done and well thought out so as not to be confusing nor distracting. The major drawback to this edition is that it was published in 1958 so there is not more recent information about this area for the past half century, Also, I was disappointed not to find more information about the author.Recommended"
2,"A bad surprise, who would have thought,,,,","The glass face is very reflective. Any room with a window or door and it shows up on the clock face. Very dissappointing. Very Annoying. good side, it is a well made, handsome, silent clock.I put mine on a shelf and got a brown silent clock. great.."
5,Good collection,This is a good collection of hits. They are in a nice order to listen to. Really glad I ordered it.
4,Nice collection of songs.,"Many I did not realize were hits. It's a nice collection and I do enjoy the CD, his voice, and the songs."
3,Love the early stuff...but so talented in many ways,"Cross is underrated as a singer, arranger, writer and entertainer...his earlier material is his claim and also his monkey, but listen to all to capture whom he is."
4,Good CD,I just bought this cd and christopher cross has the most beautiful voice I have ever heard. It is well worth the money spent.
3,"""Sailing"" is the Best!","I was a little disappointed. Of all the songs, ""Sailing"" is the Best. I may want to sell or give this away."
4,Missing something,This 2002 release could have and should have included the 2001 remix of Ride Like The Wind.
2,A Little Good and Lots of Bad,CC had a couple nice songs from long ago which are included here but the rest of this is a mess. The other songs are horrible! There is a reason we never heard from him again. Get it for the hits but don't expect much else. Disappointed!
5,Chick tunes!,"Chick tunes!TImeless as well! And, I like some chick tunes too! ....and, not just for the effect on mood and success rate! LOL"
4,More Hits Than You Might Remember,"My wife got this for me because when he'd come on the radio I would say ""Do you remember this one?"". Anyway, I was surprised how many songs on there I knew once I listened to it."
5,Very worthwhile,"Don't trash it before you hear it all. Granted, some of the tracks are mediocre at best, but most are moving and beautiful.""Swept Away"" is just too beautiful. It hurts to actually listen to this song too many times because of the profound meaning in it. This is my favourite song on the CD.""Back of my Mind"" is upbeat and fun. ""When She Smiles"" is a bit corny but very catchy. ""Hunger"" is a deep, dark song that should get more attention than the last song on the CD.Every song on the CD is just awesome."
5,Wheeler Scope Tool,"TheWheeler Scope Leveling Toolis a neat tool. Easy and convenient to use. Small enough to put in the range box (it comes in two pieces, the largest of the two is only about an inch and half long. I'm not a rocket scientist, but I was able to use it right out of the package to correct a scope misalignment from an earlier date. Where has this been all my life?!"
5,Cool little tool!,This is a great little tool to help you mount and level scopes. I wish I would have bought this sooner.
3,"Ok, but not great","I am surprised this product actually works, but you must have a stable gun rest or VISE when you use it or you'll never get your scope leveling right!"
2,Good,"The Wheeler Level Level Scope Leveling Tool to mount rifle scope is NOT the best for self doer. The base magnet is NOT strong enough to adhere as per instruction. Following the instruction sheet does not do what it suppose too. It easily move and took awhile to level a rifle in preparation to mount a rifle scope. The second small level, I placed on the slide base mount to double check the level of the rifle. I used a Barska Boresighter to line the scope reticle and carpenter level."
3,Not Used Yet,"Have not had an opportunity to use this yet, but seems to be of good quality. Will update once I get to use it."
1,Level Level Level Not Level,"The one I purchased was awful. Neither of the two levels was level, nor were they level to each other. The problem seems to come from the cheap plastic bases. The tubes don't seat properly."
1,VERY CHEAPLY MADE!,"I purchased this after reading the reviews on this sight. It wasn't what I expected when I opened it. The first thing I noticed was the magnet had very little power if any at all. It would not stick to my rifles. If I wanted one to hold ,I already had levels that were small enough to hold by hand. It was very cheaply made,had some sort of black stuff inside the bubble case.I returned it and ordered a Laserlyte level that fits on my laser bore sight. I hope it works,as this product would not. I tried it on the chamber and on top of the scope neither one had enough magnetism to stay in place. I tried on several firearms before I gave up.Maybe I just received a bad unit?"
2,The chamber level sucks,"I got this to fine tune the leveling of the scopes on my Tikka, Mosin Nagant, and 2 Remingtons. The level you stick in the chamber is garbage. It's impossible to know when it's mounted correctly as I can get it to go in and stay put at any number of angles. The directions say ""Place magnetic base of action level across receiver rails"". I couldn't get it up over the left side rail on all of them and the magnet holds it in place wherever you leave it regardless of whether or not it's sitting level on the rails."
5,Two Animals for Two Toddlers,"I purchased this to give to 18 month old twins. I thought it would be perfect since there are two of every animal. I am already a fan of Fisher-Price Little People sets. I have theFisher Price Little People Lil' Movers School Busand it has been a big hit with with the grand kids. I'm just sorry Mrs. Noah missed the boat on this one! I am glad that there are two other sets of animals you can get for this set. One isFisher Price Little People Noah's Animals Pandas, Lions, and Turtles - Assortmentand the other isFisher Price Little People Noah's Animals Kangaroos, Hippos, and Leopards- Assortment.One of the things I usually don't like about most Fisher-Price toys is how hard they are to wrap. There is usually an open part in the box that lets you try something out on the toy. This box is completely enclosed, as are the boxes of the additional sets. I was glad to see this since it will make wrapping so much easier."
5,My daughter played with this daily for 3 years,"We bought this about 6 years ago for my daughter when she was 2. The original version as shown here plus an expansion pack with leopards, rhinos, and some sort of tropical birds. Also Mr. and Mrs. Noah.I swear she played with this thing every day for 3 years and grew tired of it just as her little brother grew interested. He's now 4 and has developed a passion for things with wheels so Noah is going to live with their baby (16-month) cousin."
4,Exactly what I wanted,I ordered this to use the animals on a cake. The kids now play with the whole set. We also have one at the daycare where I work and it's lasted quite a while.
4,Could be more tub-oriented,"One the whole, this is a typical, durable fisher-price toy, and my kids have fun playing with it. It is nice that they make biblical-type toys (wish they'd bring the nativity set back!). My only problem is that, being a boat, my kids of course think it should go in the bathtub, and it really isn't designed for that. The wool hair on the animal takes a long time to dry, and the animals don't drain, because the little holes are on the bottom of their stomachs, so you can't get the water out of the animals feet (on the other hand, they won't really fill with water by themselves - my kids decided to deliberately fill them by pouring water in the little holes).A fun toy on the whole, but would be better if more suited for being played with in the water. And I agree with a lot of the other reviews that a Mrs. Noah would have made sense as well."
4,Where's Mrs. Noah?,"Good toy. It's a little ""old"" for 12 month old but she still enjoys carrying around the animals. I think she'll enjoy it more as she gets older and begins pretend play. Animals are cute but all that's missing is Mrs. Noah. I wonder where she is? I also like that all the animals store in the boat. Makes clean up and keeping organized easier."
4,where is Mrs. Noah?,"We really like this toy very much- We have twin toddlers and having two of each animal is perfect! However, we are dissappointed that there is no Mrs. Noah- After all the Ark is all about TWOs. Very Durable, love having the the little food crates too- the kids love feeding the animals! The little ramp to the main Ark door comes out very easily tho, and is difficult for even me to put back in, so we leave it off most of the time. All in all, a great toy for twins and others!!"
2,Disappointed by the change,"I don't actually own this item. What we own is the earlier version, where the animials are all plastic.I went to buy this for a friend and was very disappointed in the change. One of the best things about this set was that the animals were durable and easy to clean. My son carried the zebras with him everywhere and I could even put them in the dishwasher after he ""fed"" them sweet potatoes.I don't doubt that children would love to ""touch and feel"" the new, cloth parts. What I doubt is that parents will WANT them to touch and feel those parts after a few months of accumulated grime.I suggest finding the old set gently used, and buying that instead."
3,My grandson enjoys it.,"I thought there would be a little more to it. Just stick the little animals in the holes and that's it. A little difficult to remove the upper deck to get the animals out. My grandson will be turning 2 in March and he likes it so I guess that is all that matters. He gets a little bored with it but he's only 2,"
4,My 13 month old loves this,My 13 month old daughter loves this toy. She likes to put all the animals inside and shut the door. She will do thise for a long time. She isn't quite at a place where she wants to put animals on the pegs yet. I do wish it had more than 3 pegs though because there aren't very many places for the animals to stand. And...the female lion looks like a bear until you notice it's tail.
5,Little People Noah's Ark,"I love this toy and, more importantly, my kids love it! I noticed in other reviews some complained about the new design and the fuzzy animals but I bought and received the original Noah's Ark, not the Touch and Feel version. Thank goodness! These are easy to clean and I appreciate that this toy does not make noise or light up. My only real complaint is not with the toy but with the product listing here on Amazon. The product features section does not specifically list what is included and the item picture is not in its package. Add in the reviews that seem to be talking about a different product (the Touch and Feel version) and I just wasn't sure what all came with this. I finally had to go to the Fisher-Price website to verify that this item includes the ark, Noah, 2 giraffes, 2 lions, 2 elephants and 2 zebras."
3,"Fun, but something's wrong with an ark that doesn't float","My 15-month-old got this for her first birthday. She loves the animals and wants to play with them in the tub. The problem is that the animals have a hole in their underbellies, above where their legs end. Gravity is working against them -- water just doesn't drain out well at all, which leaves you with a wet, sloppy, germy mess if you actually let this floating zoo into your tub. The toy is very durable, though, and easy to surface clean. Most of our animals are smooth, but we have a couple of tigers with hair that gets soggy when wet, but gets clean easily enough. My 8-year-old son's main beef with this toy, though, is that when he wants to float it in the kiddie pool to play with his sister, it sinks like a rock. Oh well."
3,Too Tippy,"I bought Noah's Ark for two little ones I provide childcare for. Love the Little People - sturdy, easy to clean, etc. But the bottom of the ark is so ""tippy"" that it can't stand up on its own without adult help, even on the kitchen floor and particularly on the living room carpet. Wish it was wider and flatter on the bottom so the 2-yr old could play with it on his own. Also wish the ark door was wider so that the animals could all easily fit in. The larger ones (elephants, giraffes) have to be sort of crammed in sideways. Concept is great, materials and workmanship great, actual ability to use/play with the toy has some limitations."
5,One of There best LP's,"When I first heard this LP back in the 70's, I knew I had to purchase this LP. Firefly, Memories and of course the one that caught my attention: A Song for You. A must have."
5,Beautiful. Just Beauitful.,"This album has it all! Side 1 is (what I like to call) the ""Funky"" Side, While Side 2 is (what I like to call) the ""Lover's"" side. I don't have this on CD though, but I know Motown is pretty good about re-releasing the old albums. One of the few Companies that is like that."
4,Childhood memories,"I remember this album, from my childhood. I am currently 34 years old. And, in 1975 this album was a staple, in my family's life. I recently brought this album on CD, just for the song ""firefly"", along with the title track. Although, this does not represent the genius of the original Temps lineup, it indeed was a good substitute. I wish that there was some artwork, that accompanied this project. But, I loved to watch the Gordy purple record lable, with the yellow arrow, spin around the record player. Till this day, that symbol represents good, soulful music, to me.PEACE.I write because I suffer, Inc.r.l.will.sun."
3,Mid 70's Temptations,"A Song For You is a hit and miss album from 1975. With Dennis Edwards stepping to the leadership role in the band, his harder edge voice is better suited to the funkier numbers featured on the album. ""Shaky Ground"" is a slamming, funky track that Mr. Edwards really rips into and ""Happy People"" and ""Glasshouse"" are quite good as well. The album slows down both literally and figuratively on the ballads. Without the heavenly falsetto of Eddie Kendricks, the songs don't have that heavenly quality that he added."
4,Great Quality,This CD brought back many memories of my childhood. Remastered instrumentals and great quality vocals made listening to it even more enjoyable.
3,Not their best work,"Thank God for CD's!! The title song is the best thing on the album, and definitely worth listening to."
5,The Last GREAT Temps album...,"Rickey Wright got it wrong, this album is all that and a bag of chips, and a pack of Bubblelicious! 1975, I was a freshman in college and everyone was jamming to 'Shakey Ground', but I was always drawn to the ""b"" (ballad) side of the set; A Song for You, Memories, Firefly and I'm a Bachelor. Not a weak sister in the bunch, all prime filet. That five-part harmonizing that no one could touch was in fine, fine form. Dennis earned his ""Temptations Forever"" tag with this one, he put his own stank on it, beyond any of the Norman Whitfield days...for me anyway. There was nothing after this album that touched me the way this one did.I was blessed to see the ""Original"" Temps; Otis, Paul, Eddie, David and Melvin at the tender age of 13 and YES they were the singin'est, steppin'est, dressin'est group out there, truly ""the Emperors of Soul""...GET THIS."
5,A WRITER'S MUST HAVE,"A college 'writer's course' in one little volume. Concise, well written, enjoyable read . . . an indespensible tool for anyone seriously considering professional writing with style. Should be a mandatory text in any competent university's humanities department."
5,Wine dog charms are cute,"Just what i was looking for. Quality seems good, they have some weight to them, and they're cute."
3,Songs are Good But Transfered pretty poor.,"I can't believe there wasn't a non used Vinyl for this Refugee Cd. I wonder if the masters are lost or kidnapped by the Loch Ness Monster. I never understand these idiots who love vinyls that make snap, crackle and pop. These clowns that listen to Pearl Jam that love Vinyls, all your records are going to have crackle and pop sounds. The good thing here at least you don't get a cheap cardboard packaging like Pearl Jam CD have, that has no protection that can't be replaced if damaged."
4,Delta 36-600,My first table saw. Takes two unexperienced persons to assemble but it lots of fun. I really like it though it is tremendously noisy. The fence feels right and if calibrated properly is quite precise for the price.
5,Awesome Resource!,"I am so glad I was able to find this book (as I had been told it was out of print)and that it was sent to me in such a timely manner!If you are an educator this book is a wonderful resource for teaching, especially ESL students, but it also integrates great ideas to make lessons more meaningful for all students."
2,Awful,"Unless you like horribly filmed lectures that are tedious and boring you will not like this documentary. The audio is terrible and the entire set seems like it was made in Windows Movie Maker, bought this at Walmart and was extremely disappointed. If I were you I would pass on this one"
1,Horrendous,"Elfriede Jelinek's intellect and ability to write is more than good enough, but her constant negativity, her need to arrogantly disturb the reader's enjoyment as they read with self-parody and the literary equivalent of theatrical illusion, her condescending and vacuous tone, and her self-indulgence completely ruins this book. Her radical feminist political agenda and her compulsion to depict the world as a mirror of her own personal neurosis (she is a self-described sociophobe) infect every chapter, every page and every sentence of this book. But the worst aspect of this book is that when you read it, you get a clear sense of Jelinek's utter contempt for her readers. Why else would she consciously make this book so painful to read?"
4,"Shocking, vicious, surprising","Wonderful,Wonderful Times is the ironic title for a nasty, engrossing story of four young people in post-war Vienna. The author spares no mercy in skewering their character, their dreams, their hopes on her didactic pen. So much venom.These are characters you will love to despise and which the author delights in showing in the worst possible light and is creative enough to make it almost poetic--if you see the beauty in psychic wounds which bleed hatred.The plot is a series of encounters in which the young people--some parents and others are preipheral characters--meet and talk with the purpose of committing the perfect crime: unmotivationless, calculated.How that comes about caught me by surprise, like a blow to the solar plexus.Read it and weep--not for them but for mankind."
5,Demolishes Your Body,"I'm on week three of this program and I can attest to its effectiveness. Your body will feel like you can't possible work out another day. Yet, the next day I am willingly back for more. I don't have an extensive home gym so I've taken what I've learned from the DVD to the gym. It been awesome! I highly recommend this workout. Learn more of my journey: [...]"
5,Body Beast Introductory Kit,I have been using the DVD's since I received them an I have increased the amount of weights I use as I progress in the program.
2,I feel like the other reviews are staged...,"Maybe I'm being biased, but I returned this product after a week of use. It's ridiculous, the cast is in there struggling on the first few sets curling 25-30 lbs - how's that possible when they all weigh 200+ and are jacked?Like one of the other reviews said, there's some super cheesy lines whenever they try to pump you up - not craving that extra rep when I'm laughing..I started lifting weights using P90x 3 years ago and would highly recommend that product over this one. Maybe I'm expecting way too much out of a home body building program, but I feel like I could get more out of making up my own workout."
2,not for big dogs,"This is cute, and would probably work well for small dogs. I have two large dogs, over 50lbs each, and it didn't last over 2 weeks. Cute idea, not strong enough."
1,limited,"This game was a big flop. I loaded it and soon cleared it out. I felt it was too phony for me, might be good for person not familiar whit pinballs."
2,Not that much fun,"I thought these would be really fun pinball games, but I felt they were not! You could never get any big points, which makes a person teed off to say the least. For me this was a waste of money"
4,Awesome,"A very nice power pop here whit the great voice of Jamie Rowe, awesome songs here like ""The Misfits Song"" ,. A very well done work"
3,"Simple & enjoyable read, with a family tie","""Lookout Mountain"" has a personal tie as my grandfather was the model for Ranger Farley. It is an interesting period-piece, in that it details the functions and methods of a 1950s USFS firespotter and how their family is part of the team. The style and writing is dated and slightly hokey, but it covers an interesting subject matter, and chronicles an adventure young boys and girls today miss out on. I really enjoyed reading it as a 10-year old boy, even when not aware of my personal connection, and I am enjoying it again at 50."
3,Passion is steamy,"The plot of the book is about a woman finding herself throughout different periods of her life and trying to keep passion in her life. This translates to steamy sex scenes with the men in her life at the time. There is, of course, a larger plot about her meeting the right guy, etc. etc., but the writing on the other scenes wasn't enough to keep the flow going. I thought the writing was a little stale for me and I never really got into the characters, so it wasn't the greatest book in the world. On the other hand, it did make for an interesting read. I wouldn't really recommend it to people, since it didn't seem to have much of a purpose besides being erotica (regardless of the description) and I wasn't too crazy about the end, but if you're looking for some steamy passion... look no further!"
4,South Asia Clime?,"Threads of Passion is what English majors would call a ""bodice ripper,"" from the cover on. Basically it's a series of loosely stitched together steamy sex scenes. And the most surprising thing of all is that the author doesn't seem to see it this way. ..."
2,For the Absolute Beginner!,"Living in North Carolina, I purchased this product expecting some insight on ""Successful Strategies"" approaching our small,tight,rhodo choked mountain streams. Please note as an experienced angler I wasn't expecting secrets to be revealed, but what I received was a 101 version of flyfishing, period. No advanced strategies to approach bluelines, nothing. I DO WANT TO MAKE A POINT that this is not a direct ""stab"" at the author or his wife. In fact, they are one of the foremost professional guiding services in all Southern Appalachia and their knowledge is seldom surpassed! I just feel this product targets only the fundamentals and nothing else. To the beginner, I give two thumbs up! For anyone else, I'm sorry, but it's not worth it."
4,Good for cleaning Cast Iron,"I have had this for a little over a year now and the ends of the bamboo strips are pretty well frayed. It requires a little more elbow grease than it did initially, but still works very well. Since you shouldnt use soap on a seasoned cast iron pan, these are the ideal. The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is somewhat bulky and difficult to find a spot for on an already cluttered sink."
1,Worked fine until it quit,"Worked fine for exactly 6 months; then the motor quit. We probably had about 20 hours of use. Will see if Delta fixes it without too much expense on our part (the warranty states that the electric motor may have to be shipped to the mfgr for inspection.)Update: took about 6 months to fix at the nearest Delta repair center, 45 minutes away. Works fine again."
1,Terrible Quality,"I bought this microphone thinking that it wouldn't be possible to waste only $2.99 on anything. I was horribly wrong. I plugged in the Jensen microphone and tried to record with it, but its quality was so awful that the sound was barely recognizable."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"The quality of sound recorded is poor because recordings done with the mic have a background hissing noise. It's a good deal for a few dollars but if you're looking for a quality microphone, you're better off looking for another product."
4,Works fine for the money,"We used it with this voice e-mail program called TalkSender.com It worked just fine with it... I wouldn't use it for voice recognition, but with Talksender, I didn't need the voice recog anymore cos I was sending voice emails instead."
4,Not bad,How can you beat the price on this microphone? Quality is fine and I haven't had any problems with it.
3,OK product,"Good idea for those who travel with pets. Be aware when it arrives, you'll have to fill it with water for a few days to soak away that ""plastic"" odor."
5,ENYA ALL THE WAY,"Thjer`s Two Different Versions Of This Album, A Short And A Long. They Are All Realy Great."
4,Solid Material From A Master Aviator,"Art is the real deal, the manual is quite good. Perhaps the presentation is a little dated/corny, but that does not detract from the valuable contents. I make it a point to at least look at anything Art Medore has written or taped, and so far I have not be disappointed."
5,3M Medium-Grit Sanding Screen,Works fine. Will leave small ridges in the plaster if stroke is repeated without deveation. used with Hyde Dust-free hand sander. Vacuum is outside while sanding inside. It works. cost less than thru HD.
4,Useful,Works very well. Very useful in repairing walls of a 100 year old home. I will be ordering more in the future.
5,A forgotten Gem!,"Written and performed only once in 1713, the title track was lost and completely forgotten for almost 300 years. ""Alles mit Gott und nicths ohn' ihn"" is an ode in 12 stanzas put to music by Bach. At 12-minutes-plus, the three stanzas presented hear are enough. Elin Manahan Thomas' voice is divine - she executes as if she has been singing this tune for years. The remaining selections on the disc are just as perfectly performed - as expected, given Gardiner's direction. But, I suspect that, like myself, most will buy this disc for the 'new' song."
4,Bach: Alles mit Gott,"Bach: Alles mit Gott is a recording that can be divided into two parts. First one gets to hear BWV 1127 ""Alles mit Gott und nicht ohn's ihn"" and then BWV 182 ""Himmelskönig, sei willkommen"". The first is sung by Elin Manahan Thomas (soprano) and her performance is simply put it oustanding. The second is played by The English Baroque Soloists, sung by The Monteverdi Choir and directed by John Eliot Gardiner. Michael Maul has written the liner-notes and the lyrics come in English, French and German. Recommended. 4/5."
5,"beautiful, spiritual, I just loved it",It is very nice and peaceful to listen to and I want to find more music like this.
3,"Funny, however, Mary Kay does not test on animals....","The comic strip is great, the book was hillarious. However, upon doing some research into the Mary Kay Cosmetics company, I found that they do not test on animals. So I am a little lost as to the whole point of the book..."
5,"Bloom County! Milo, Opus, Binkley, Bill, Oliver, and more!","""Even their uzis are pink!!!"" The Mary Kay Salesladies are still running amok across the country like Opus after Boinger practice! Though, now that I think of it, my opinion of them was never so skewered before discovering Bloom County...Berke Breathed at his best!"
3,Disappointed - Not in condition described.,"Even though the book arived quickly and it was not torn, it was in very OLD condition (discolored) and smelled like SMOKE horribly. I have never bought a NEW book that smelled like that. It actually made me appriciate the fact that I quit smoking 6 years ago."
5,Perfect For My Needs,"I was looking for a flat board with a well around the perimeter to keep liquids from running off (plus small enough to fit in the bottom of my sink so I could soak it in bleach to clean). This has been perfect. Also, the four corners are somewhat ""rubberized"" and prevent it from sliding around when you're using it."
2,History of Polish Americans a disappointment,"I expected quite a bit more from this book, written by the modern translator of Henryk Sienkiewicz's epic Trilogy. My Name Is Million, a history of Polish Americans, reads at an eighth-grade level. Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, this book was originally published in 1978, making it hopelessly outdated. Take my advice and don't waste your time and money.If you would like to read a history of American Polonia for grown-ups, I can highly recommend A History of the Polish Americans by John J. Bukowczyk or Polish Americans by Helena Znaniecka Lopata."
4,Great for the price,We use these for our photo booth. I also used them for a quick on location headshot at someone's home and it worked great. I am a firm believer if you want great quality that lasts then you need to spend the money on the good lights. In my studio I use white lightenings but those are so heavy and hard to transport everywhere. These are awesome for quick use and our photo booths.
1,"noisy, hard to control, did not last","This light was noisy from the beginning. I've got 5 other strobes and none of them have fans or make any noise while in standby. This one has a fan and is pretty noticeable. I had the flash for 3 months, and had only used it a few times before it developed a problem. Now, when it warms up, it starts firing spontaneously, over and over. I'm pretty sure it's not even worth the cost of shipping it back to be repaired/replaced."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought 2 of these Versalight 160 6 months ago and i used them just 3 times for 10 minutes...I was so excited when i recieved them but not for a long time. All started when i wanted for the first time to turn off the flashes: I did as they wrote in instruction but the result was a fuse burned...after i changed the fuse all was ok...A few day ago,when i wanted to use the flashes again, i opened the flashes, i did some shots when the flash light got burned with the bulb...So i start to think about this business...if its so profitable to spend 300$ for something that you can use just 30 minutes..."
1,Junk,I bought this J-160 last month and used it once. Yesterday I applied power and something inside popped with spark. I will try to send it back for repair....
3,complaint,"This book was received. It is a very much USED book! ! I was chargedover $17.00. (price for a new book). A weird way to do business.A considerable credit ia appropriate to my account. Do it, please.THANKS"
1,"""A Total Disappointment""","This is nowhere near the usual standard of excellence I've come to expect from Charles D. Taylor. ""The Sunset Patriots"" just dragged and the characters were merely names on papaer, not flesh and blood people you come to care about. In most of the scenes, Taylor just told you what was happening, instead of letting the characters describe it to you. What dialogue Taylor did have was very uninspiring. I'm just glad he improved since ""The Sunset Patriots"" to write some very good books like ""Boomer"" and ""Shadow War."""
3,Don't buy this game for the Career Mode,"I bought this game thinking it would be cool to compete against other skaters in career mode, but this game is really simply an arcade style game. The career mode, is you against the level. I was really wanting to see the runs of the other skaters, and feel like I was competing more with them directly. A fun game for arcade fans, but for those interested in career, don't get it."
4,taralambert,"I'll just get to the negatives. The reasons I gave it only 4 stars is:1. If you fall during a ""chain"" of tricks, you get ZERO points for all your effort.2. At least on my 450mhz/RivaTNT machine, sometimes the skater won't turn when I tell it to ...3. Some of the hidden areas are impossible to find w/out searching the internet for clues.4. In order to unlock the final level, you have to 100% all the previous levels (and win 3 gold medals) with EACH of the 5 (or so) skaters included in the game. This would take me about 2 years to complete - BOGUS (I hate cheating).5. Finally, I think the people/graphics look a little cheezy (the locations, ramps and skies look pretty good, though).Other than that, it's a great investment! (If you're like me, you'll yell at your computer allot - in a good way)"
5,Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2,"This game is awesome and addictive. It took me about 1 yr to beat it, then i got the cheats for it. Its fun with the cheats too. Thers i think maybe 8 diff skate parks, but once you pass them, you got 3 extra parks...plus you have a slew of pre-made parks to practice on. So even if you['re bad] at the game you can ride the pre-made parks. You can also make your own parks, and it's easy to make. You don't need to know any programming.Other games like this: Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3, Grind Session, Thrasher"
1,Warning,This game is not worth gettting on pc or mac its hard to control and sometimes dont work get it for ps not comp
5,Awesome! Awesome game!,"I was never really a skater but when Tony Hawk's pro skater demo came out I was hooked and I had to get it! Now that THPS2 is out it's even better! much more to collect and see you can even play as Spider-Man! How cool is that! I remember when the THPS2 demo came out for PC I downloaded it and had a blast! It was so cool I got a score of over 945,600 on my 3rd try! I just love this game! and if you have a Network then you and whoever else is there can go Head to Head with each other Believe me it's fun! All's what I can say is that this beats the PSX version buy 10 fold! You should really get a PSX PC pad for this game if so it plays and feel's just like the PSX version just with better Graphics and control."
4,It is better on the Dreamcast,This game is great.. but better on dreamcast... let me explain the good and bad about this gameThe Good???- Good graphics- Lots of skaters and skate parks to choose from- Good carer mode- A fun game in general!!!The Bad???- Very stupid and annoying music... very bad music :(- NO ONLINE MULTIPLAYER!!! >:-(- Can get laggy sometimes
4,Lovely but a bit too mellow,"This is a great CD for a relaxing winter evening. To be honest, I expected the collection to be more... energetic, precussive, aggressive. Most songs are gentle, mellow and elusive."
5,Best Celtic Album that I ever heard,"This is a great album (CD). Once I heard it I was hooked on Celtic music. Even after buying lots of other Celtic album's this is still the ""Best Celtic Album that I ever heard""."
5,My Kind of Music,"This album separates itself from nearly all other Celtic albums. I have about 18 cassettes/cds of Celtic music, including Narada albums ""Celtic Odyssey and ""Celtic Spirit"". I have listened to ""Dance of the Celts"" once and it is already at the top of my favorites list for Celtic music. Think of the music that Jack and Rose danced to on Titanic and you'll have a good idea of what ""Dance of the Celts"" is all about. All of the music is up-tempo, even the complimentary slower pieces. Visualize the race track at Sonoma, Ca. Up, down, fast, faster, then a pit stop and off you go again for a total of 15 songs. This cd is going to get a lot of play-time."
4,Another Narada set worth having,"Just what I was looking for...good celtic dance music from a range of artists. I'm rarely disappointed with Narada collections and this was no exception. I've always found this label to be a good introduction to artists I might not be familiar with. I don't have a vast Celt collection, so ""Dance of the Celts' fit my needs."
5,Tasty,"Very strong collection. I dig Solas and others too. This is really solid. Also, primo 20-bit recording too. If you have a mack daddy stereo like I do, then it is sparkling, but would still be tasty on a boombox too I reckon."
3,Temptation Take On Standards,"Berry Gordy liked to have his artists tackle various forms of music so artists like the Supremes and Marvin Gaye released albums of songs by Rogers & Hart, standards, Broadway tunes and others. In A Mellow Mood finds The Temptations performing various standards and Broadway tunes. Songs like ""Ol' Man River"", ""The Impossible Dream"", ""A Taste Of Honey"" and ""Hello Young Lovers"" give the group the opportunity to show off their impressive vocal skills but they aren't filled any emotion. The album seems like a school project where the band sings well enough to get a good grade, but after it's completed you get nothing out of it."
2,in amellow mood,i love the temps but i do not like this album it does not have umph the temps usually have i brought as a combination with another temp cd sorry i brought it
5,Supremely Talented Vocal Artists Sing Some of My Favorites!,"I love this recording. I bought it in vinyl in the '60's and just bought the cd several weeks ago. This recording introduced me to a number of these songs. This is one of Gordy's best ideas. Set to orchestral or intimate combo like accompaniment, the tracks use timeless songs to showcase and record for the ages the power and incredible talent of the individual original Temps, as well as the awe-inspiring smoothness and richness of the group's harmony. The mixing leaves a raw and emotional elegance that resulted in these renditions enduring as my personal references for most of these songs. Paul Williams was the surprising standout for me, but Ruffin and Kendricks were absolutely superb in their turns out front. One could nit pick some of the mix down choices, but any criticisms are substantially overpowered by the brilliance of the Temptations, the arrangements and the overall performance."
3,People don't know how to appreciate good music...,"Even it's older standards, IN A MELLOW MOOD, was an album given to me in 1970, (fith grade), and I liked it from the beginning. Some of the songs didn't get me, but I learned to sing FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE(fantastic Paul William' rendition), David Ruffin's THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM, and the ensemble HELLO YOUNG LOVER'S within a month while working around the house. Not a typical Tempts album for sure, but a pleasant listen for any serious singing buff."
5,A golden example of the true talents the Temptations hold,This CD is an excellent purchase if your a true temptations fan. For Once in my life and Ol Man River are grand examples of how the temptations can take any song and make it better.
1,Disservice to Asian American History,"I will not even make a stab at trying to point out the numerous flaws and inconsistencies with this work. It is both facile and inaccurate, essentializing the experiences of Asian Americans in an Orientalist context. You are far better served reading any number of historical works that synthesize the experiences of Asian Americans, including Suchen Chan, Asian Americans: An Interpretive History (Boston: Twayne Publishing, 1991); Gary Okihiro, Margins and Mainstreams (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1995); and Ron Takaki, Strangers from a Different Shore, Revised Edition (New York: Penguin, 1998). As a historian of the Asian American experience, I am dismayed when I see anything trying to pass itself off as the end-all be-all. Asian American history is an exciting field with a number of excellent works by cutting-edge scholars. Do not waste your time on this book."
1,Please don't waste your time nor your money,"Contrary to one review, Novas and Cao did NOT research. There are so many instances of incorrect information as well as shameless stereotyping. I strongly feel that no one should waste their time or money on this bound book of filth."
5,Doing Fondue with your Sweetie,"This pot is heavy cast iron and uses a flamable gel (not NAPALM) heat source to keep things warm. I thought about getting an electric fondue pot, but who wants a cord around to trip over? An electric source also limits you on where you are going to serve this. I choose the black color because a fire source is used and I would not have to worry about cleaning black marks off a lighter color. The ceramic inside makes for an easy clean-up.Fondues are fun and a pleasant way to dine with a friend or friends."
4,Steele at his best!,"A thouroughly enjoyable episode which brings out the best on both Brosnan and Zimbalist. Although at times the twists are predictable, they are handled in that suave, debonaire way that makes them entertaining all the same!"
5,Great buy,"I love the earrings. It came in a velvet bag and a box, there were instructions on how to keep earings from becoming scratched. The earrings themselves are very pretty. they are lightweight and do not pull on ear lobe. The look like solid gold even though they are gold overlay on silver. I would recommend these earrings to anyone wanting hoops. Theses area great buy."
1,One of the Worst pair of earings that I have ever purchased,"They looked breathtaking, however, the earings turned my ears black!"
4,Hot Shots,The shots of Tokyo that open up Pale Flower are fairly stunning. Pale Flower has great musical score and several nice set pieces set in the Japanese Underworld of the early sixties. I especially liked the horse racing sequence where the droll Yakuza bosses play chess with other people's lives brief though it is. Get out your checklist: Yakuza/Gangster/ Amor Fou/ Stark Cinematography. If those are on your sheet you probably will enjoy Pale Flower.The extras are a little scant for a Criterion release (hence the deduction of a star) but the transfer and restoration are quite pristine.
5,A Beautiful work of art.,"I won't go into detail about what this movie is about, cause you can read that anywhere, but will say to see it on Blu Ray is an incredible experience. Probably one of the best films I have seen."
3,YAKUZA NOIR,"Tokyo's underworld of drugs, drag-racing, gambling and the doomed love of an ex con and a mysterious woman collide in PALE FLOWER (Home Vision Entertainment). Masahiro Shinoda's Yakuza tale reflects much of the meticulous Jean-Pierre Melville style but stands on its own. In stark black and white with a cooly twisted score by Toru Takemitsu."
3,NOT UP TO DELTA STANDARDS,Large motor body is the size of the wheels and gets in the wayWheels are wobbling slightlyOnly 0.25 hp on the motor plate
5,Great Music,"Great Christian Rock. Love ""Crack the Sky"" and other gems. Great to have them on CD. Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes!"
2,original Version Please,"I do NOT own this CD and the reason I don't, is that it does NOT contain the ORIGINAL version of Gospel Ship. Mylon has re-recorded it. Not crazy about artists doing that. Billy Grammer did it with Bonaparte's Retreat. I ordered the Monument Story to get that one song and found an alternate take. I still have the original on 45 thank goodness.I would love to find the original version Mylon put out. I know his family, The LeFavres recorded it and that sounds really great; but it's not Mylon's original."
1,BEWARE,"""WARNING: I purchased 4 AA batteries for 11.84 (incl Shipping). In addition they don't come in the duracell packaging and I now know why. I put them in my Sweeper and it appears that the batteries has lost A LOT of its energy. I decided to put them in my nephews piano and it was confirmed these batteries needed energy. I don't know if they gave me used batteries, but these batteries operated as if they were. I contacted the company and nothing was done to resolve my issue. That's o.k. it's only $11.84, I will work 1.5 hours to make that back. On my way to K-Mart to get batteries that works. DON'T ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY. I REPEAT DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY."
2,A very long-time customer quits,IN MY OPINION --Over the past year or so: too many of my Duracel batteries have leaked. One took the stain finish off my wooden table top (shape of the battery). Another ruined a TV controller and several others leaked and required the controllers to be meticuously cleaned before they were again operational.
4,batteries,"these are batteries that were purchased for a toy - I purchased Duracell because I expect them to perform well - as the toy was a gift, I do not know personally how long the batteries have lasted, but I would hope that they have performed to my expectation!!"
4,"Great batteries, better than Energizer.",I think Duracell and Duracell Ultra are great batteries. If you're going to buy batteries you should buy Duracell.
4,All-brass Foster is very different and entertaining,"Although the title of this disk is self-explanatory, I was nevertheless surprised to hear Foster's songs interpreted and played by an all-brass ensemble. The effect is decidedly a departure from the usual vocal or sweet orchestral arrangements. I'd recommend this album especially for lovers of Foster's music. It's a different take, and you'll like it, particularly after a few listens."
2,Not their best,"I usually like Schleich's figures more but this one seems almost cartoonish. If your looking for a more realistic figure, I would go with the Papo's deer instead.http://www.amazon.com/Papo-53008-Stag/dp/B000TR1AZ8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1345231348&sr;=8-1&keywords;=papo+deer"
5,just what I wanted,I bought this to go on our Grooms cake and it is just what the picture looked like. It is very cute.
5,"Using as a cake topper for a groom's cake, will work great!","This item was exactly what I was looking for. Doing a hunting scene on the groom's cake at my wedding and was looking for something realistic. This was perfect! Not too big, but not tiny either. Very realistic. Can't really say anything as far as, ""fun"" or ""played with it"". But for what I needed, it was perfect."
1,Amazingly Appallingly Awful,"The worst version I've ever seen. The story is constantly modified to avoid special effects$$. The Alice actress was instructed to be deadpan throughout, which is just as well because I get the impression she can't act anyhow. About the only fun is spotting Eric Idle (future Python) as an extra a couple of times. Some of the changes seem amazing to me: at thebeginning the sisters go into the field alone - no rowboat with Dodgson and Duckworth."
3,A Dreamy 1960's Take on a Victorian Classic,"BORING ~ but a dreamy 1960's take on a Victorian classic. The most redeeming quality is the surreal mood it conveys, backed by the beautiful music of Ravi Shankar."
3,more peculiar than curiouser,"When I read about the particulars of this British TV special I was practically salivating. Peter Sellers, Peter Cook, and music by Ravi Shankar at the height of 1966 pre-psychedelia? How perfect does that sound?Jonathan Miller has staged a very stylish production, but by accentuating eccentricities to suggest characters originally created by Carrol as fantasy, the effect is more nervous and uncomfortable than the dreamlike charm normally associated with the story.Opinions vary, and this certainly is a most original and interesting take on the old chestnut. Certainly worth a look by the adventurous viewer."
1,Fountain,"Fountain faulty, did not work, defective parts. No parts to rplace, not made since 2007, bad news all around, returned etire fountain still awaiting refund!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,bad copy,"Although the movie is an excellent one, this copy is very bad, it cuts some good scenes of the movie. One is trying to not do piracy and the problem is tha sometimes piracy is better quality than the ""legal"" option..."
2,Staying With My Boys,Very disappointing book. The subject should have had a better author. The book was so boring I never finished it.
1,I'm staying with boys....,It is a good book.... But almost Un Readable due to Very small Print... Wish I knew that before I bought it... I am trying; but is a very slow GO.... Maybe that.is why it was a low price.....
4,Good fan for the price!,"When I opened the fan I was excited to finally have some sort of air flow for my car! The fan works great and works at a high rate of speed with a fast wind blowing. A great positive is how the fan oscillates in such a wide area. It fans both the driver and passenger. The cord is also pretty long to reach from the front plug all the way to the back of my SUV, if that is what I desired. The two bad things are it is hard to clip on anywhere in my particuar car and I don't want to damage my car by drilling into it. Secondly, the fan is sort of loud, to be expected though. At least it keeps us cool! I am happy I spent the money on it, feels like a good buy for the price."
4,Neat but noisy,"The only thing I don't like with this product is its noise. I can hardly believe a fan could be this noisy, that it's not easy to enjoy music.Design itself is neat. Simple and efficient. It attaches tightly on the headrest or the bar by its clips. The cord is long enough that it can cross almost half of the car room to reach electric outlet."
3,auto fan,"This would be a good auto fan for you if you don't have air conditioning or it is broken. We bought this for the few times that we run into a store. We use a sunshade and leave the windows most of the way down. But we thought it would be good to plug in a fan for some extra ventilation. Unfortunately the lighter only works when the ignition is on so until - and if - I wire a new outlet, I can't use it. But for extra ventilation it's probably an ok product. A battery powered one would have been better in our personal case."
1,Dont even think about it!,"I dont recommend this product for anyone. I dont think I was thinking at the time I did the purchase because the product is DEAD useless! My A/C for the vehicle wasnt working so I thought I find a shortcut and save me some money...woe unto me coz when its hot, the fan just blows hot air, considering that the clip on does not hold tight.I decided to fix my A/C!Thats what I get for getting a cheap product."
2,"Cheap, noisy, and unreliable.","I bought two of these at once, which I suppose is good because that leaves me with one that still works. The motor on the other shorted itself out inside of a week of car use. They're very rattly, in addition to the expected whine that inherently comes with a small fan at high speed. Using the oscillating feature makes them even noisier. The detents on the swivel are very weak -- do not expect the fan to stay pointed where you want it unless you tie it down or counterweight the back end."
1,If your AC doesn't work it won't help!,"I live in TX, and my AC doesn't work,so I was looking for something powerful and neat.This fan does nothing for me,just nothing! It blows some hot air around itself.I don't use it."
5,I give this 10 stars,"Sing Smokey is an excellent album. Every song on it is great. My favorite is Paul Williams leading ""You Beat Me To The Punch"". Thier version is just as good as Mary Wells. However, you can still hear the doo-wop in this album which makes it good. ""Baby, Baby I Need You"" ""You'll Lose A Precious Love"" & ""What Love Has Joined Together"" had gotten a lot of airplay back in the day in which they were all ""b"" sides of singles. ""My Girl"" of course went to #1. David, Paul & Eddie lead songs on this album and all delivered superb vocals. In my opinion, the first 4 albums were the best. I promise you, you will not be disappointed in this album. Smokey Robinson's pen and production skill showed that he was the man back in the day."
5,Captivating,"It is difficult to find perfection in a collection of any type of music, and Native American is no exception. However, to pick and place all excellent songs on one CD is truly hard to believe!Yet, this feat has been done with this CD. I have been selective in buying collections of Native American music, but this purchase was an excellent find? Close to gold in richness, and close to heaven in score, this CD is a fine work of art.Don't miss it!"
2,Good introduction &#65533; not,"Contrary to the opinion of some of the other reviewers on this page, `I Am Walking' is NOT the best place to start if you're interested in exploring contemporary Native American music. There are several other collections with much better selections of songs and artists that I believe are much more representative of Native American music today. This collection seems geared to fit into some kind of easy-listening market niche and it is markedly non-threatening to say the least. With the exception of a few nice tracks, especially a flute piece by Joseph Fire Crow, `I Am Walking' is hardly worth the money."
2,WAY too big!,"I didn't see anything on the product that gave the dimensions as being so huge. I was expecting a cute little choker and got a monstrosity of a thing that I'd never wear. The medallion is the size of my palm!Because the necklace was so cheap, however, it wasn't worth it to send it back. I simply removed the medallion and wear the multistrand part of the necklace.Just be warned that there is nothing cute or little about this necklace!"
3,not perfect,"The refurbished cassette player didn't track well when I received it. The play button moved to the side when pressed. subsequently, the reverse mechanism failed"
4,Sony WMFS420 Cassette Walkman,This product works very well for me (although it is a little under-powered to handle double cassettes.).The feature that I like the best is the auto-reverse. I plug this walkman into my car stereo to listen to tapes without having to flip them over at the end.
5,Great Music,"Two Great Albums For The Price Of One.Fantastic.as is The Genius Mind OF Donald Byrd&Crew.Hash&Eggs is The Jam.Happy Music Speaks Loudly here.Very Essential Music.Soul,Jazz&Funk that is All Of That&More."
5,A MUST for new puppy owners~,The set-it and leave-it function of the SpotBot realy helps when your new puppy has an accident on your livingroom carpet. I LOVE MY SPOT BOT!
5,Simply a MUST HAVE!,"I purchased mine over a year ago, right after they came out, I can't imagine life without it! I have cream colored carpet, it's great for stairs, kids rooms, pet stains, clean up after parties. The cleaner is expensive, but I have found on most spots plain water works great. I also use the manual hose to go over the spots after cleaning to get excess water out, works very well. If mine broke today, I would order another one ASAP!!!!"
5,Paid for itself in a week!,"Recently we dogsat for my brothers three dogs and we have two of our own. Needless to say ""marking"" was their favorite game. We had the dogs for six weeks and if it hadn't been for our Spot Bot our dining room carpet would have been ruined. It removed all of the pet stains and left no odor behind. I'm in love!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Spotbot comparison,"I recently replaced an older discountinued Bissell cleaning machine called ""The Little Green Cleaning Machine"" with the upgraded ""Spotbot"". ""Spotbot"" offers 2 automatic cycles which will clean small areas. I have used the automatic cycles on berber, plush, and commercial carpet surfaces and find that the automatic cycles laydown too much liquid. I find it necessary to use the manual cycle to remove the remaining liquid. The older machine's manual cycle is the same technology as ""Spotbot"" and combined with a little elbow grease is sufficient for most stains. For stubborn stains I suggest using the automatic cycle and follow up with the manual cycle to completely clean the area. Overall this machine has been a life extender for my 17 year old cat who vomits on my carpets on a regular basis. It also cleans auto interiors and upholstery stains efficiently. It's a great cleaning aid."
5,The BEST!!!!!,This product is WELL worth the money!!!!! I can't express enough how easy and well this product works. This machine got out every single stain that I had in my carpet even stains that had been there for quite a while!!!! I would highly recommend this product to anyone with kids or pets.
4,Does the Job,"Amazon.com offered a price I couldn't refuse...the Spotbot is terrific at cleaning your spots while you do something else (dust!) I think it does use a lot of cleaner, but at least I was happy with registering and ordering from Bissell.com.The unit is compact, lightweight and easily cleaned after use. This model is an improvement over my ten year old ""Little Green Machine"" in that the cord and hose store better. I purchased this machine because I had been so very pleased with the older model, and the fact it could run by itself was especially attractive.I would definitely recommend this unit to anyone who needs a quick and easy clean-up...a new puppy, a new baby, or just clumsy, this is a super clean-up device."
2,Not my favorite cleaner! Leaves a circle!,"I bought this item thinking I was going to love it-and I did for about 10 minutes! It is easy to use and works fast at spot cleaning HOWEVER, unless the rest of your rug is really clean (and most of them are not lets be honest!)you will see a large difference in the color of the circle left by the spot bot.I have a large area rug(8x11) in my kitchen with a cream base and rooster pattern around the edge. I keep it clean and vacuum at least twice a week and the circle was very prominent. I would bet on a light colored carpet it would be very noticeable where you had done the cleaning. I returned the item and bought the Bissell Power steamer-and love it! It looks like an upright vacuum and washes the whole rug easily! Never rent a cleaner again! I did the large area rug to new condition in an hour.Looked great!"
4,A must have for Pets!,"This works great for those just fresh accidents. Cleaner mixed with Oxy clean will make the spot disappear. Alas those set in stains, even cleaning them twice with the Oxy additive still remained. Lighter, yes, but still there."
1,Mine doesn't spray either!,"Just received my SpotBot and, as with a number of other users who reviewed the machine here, mine won't spray. The lights light up, the brushes turn, but the cleaning solution will not dispense. I took it into my local Bissell warranty service station and they had two other SpotBots in for repair with exactly the same problem. The tech said that he'll have to order parts for the repair...bummer when you can't use a product which you just purchased. Obviously Bissell has a major quality control/design problem with this machine."
4,"COMPACT-""SPECIFIC""-RELIABLE,task oriented.","Dependable,repeatable,results. Was surprised by its ability to clean up on 'spot' applications. I like it!"
2,Disappointing waste of money,"I bought this product a few years ago on a friends recommendation. I have always owned my own rug scrubbers. After using it for 2-3 months, it started making a loud sound occasionally when the scrubber spun. Eventually the noise got louder and more frequent until the entire unit froze up. Then I just used it for upholstery cleaning and the casing that held the hose on broke off. I threw it out in disgust and bought a new scrubber."
1,Worked for Two Years,"I bought the SpotBot for cleaning up our pets accidents. It was great to have something on hand to clean up these type of spots instead of having to drag out the full size shampooer. In the two years I had it it worked great; it was only used about a dozen times. When I went to use it the last time it would only work on one cycle; and then it would only spray out the shampoo but would not suck it back up.I was very disappointed on the life on the product. It was not used that much and it was well taken care of. Needless to say, I would not recommend that anyone buy this. It was not worth spending that much money on something that was not going to last any longer than it did."
1,Brown Spots,"We have been looking for a means to clean `spots' on our carpet. When we heard about the SpotBot we thought we found our answer. What a surprise the morning after... we had brown spots where we tried to use the SpotBot. I then emailed the maker and never heard a word back. Thank God, we bought it through Amazon, you were kind enough to take it back and for that we are thankful."
5,Spotbot,"I bought this as a surprise for my daughter, who is away at college with her ""friendly"" bassett hound. This has really saved her time because she just spot cleans and does not have to get out the big machine. She is extremely happy with the way it works, it is easy to operate, does a wonderful job, is not noisy, and small enough to fit in a closet (which is important in an apartment)when not in use. She told me it was the best surprise she has received in while."
5,Wish I could rank it higher than 5 stars,"So many of the complaints are true-it does use a lot of cleaner, and it does leave a wet spot, and if your carpet overall is dirty it will leave a clean spot, but in my mind these are prices well worth paying. Why? Because 2 days after we got this my 4 year old spilled an entire cup of red fruit punch on our new off white carpet. We rushed for the Spot Bot, and within a few minutes the stain was gone. I mean gone. No hint of red anywhere. We've also used it on some older stains-coffee spills, cat throw up, etc, and all of these came up. Sometimes it took more than one cycle, but again, who cares? The bottom line is that the stains are gone. This product works as advertised. We love it!"
1,Great Machine,"Great machine after I got it assembled which involved a trip clear across town. Somehow it was sentto me with the brushes not instslled. The company they sent me to was very unprofessional, seemed to me run by an idiot. After two trips and a week later, works great, so far."
1,sucks,"Do they have zero stars?The item is a waiste of money! I was hoping with todays day and age of technology the item would actually work as described. Come to find out, I had false hopes. I am now trying to return the item."
4,Good on new stains.. but old not as good,"This product worked great on cleaning my micro fiber couches and cleaning up my kids stains they made within the past 24 hours, but older set in stains, not so well. For maintenance the product is great, but if you are trying to get out old Kool-Aid or marker, it is a lost cause."
1,Messy,Used the product for a couple of days and it leaked. It leaves circle marks which can be fixed by using the brush which you have out anyways to clean up the water that dripps when you are done.
2,Working great until two months later...,I always loved Bissell products so when the spotbot came out i had to have it... I used the wand/ hose side to clean my stairs and it looked great.. Tried it a month later and noticed that the wand was leaking and found a crack in it... okay so now i am left with the self cleaning side.. That worked great until after you clean up your spot the machine leaves a ring mark on your carpet... I had to get the ring mark off by hand... not the best machine.. IT dies on yah before you get the job done...
5,Amazing!,"This product is wonderful. I have three cats and baby sit my parents dog occasionally. This past week she made piddle on the carpet, I picked up the spot bot and placed it right on the piddle. I didn't have to blot the stain, apply cleaner, wait, soak up cleaner. Just put it down, pushed a button and the piddle was gone. Just this morning one of my kitties threw up on the steps and I just picked up the solids and placed the Spot Bot down and now its clean! I love this machine, its amazing.Highly recommend."
4,Great for toddler spills and pet stains,"Cleans great, but does require a lot of the cleaning solution. If you can find a good deal on the solutions then you are all set. We have used the hose on our microfiber couch and it works well. The spot treatment gets stains out well, but it seems to use a lot of solution in the process. Definitely worth the money if you have young children and/or pets."
1,SpotBot failed (no spray),"Used 2 or 3 times in first month , then stopped spraying. Unit now in for service. Either clogged somehow or pump malfunctioned. Had a previous SpotBot for two years on which large plastic gear gear stripped teeth so brushes did not rotate. Liked unit so much got this new one. Bissell very helpful by phone to try to get it going and then said to take to service site."
4,Housebreaking your puppy?,"The Spotbot is a wonderful aid when your new (or not so new) puppy has a miss on your carpet. Simple and quick to use, and the machine's size is not so large that you find it hard to move or store. I did have to find a way to treat the outside ring it leaves on the carpet. I used a spray on cleaner to blend in the edges once the spot had dried. But still, a great machine."
2,Handy product!,"I'm quite happy with my SpotBot. With a puppy in the family, I need help with cleaning ""accidents"" and not having them come back. Takes quite a lot of cleaning solution, but this product really works. I expect to get a lot of good use from it....Follow-up.....after months of use, I have found that I prefer to use my Hoover carpet cleaner. The SpotBot covers a very small space and the carpet basically needs to be clean in the first place or you end up with a ""clean"" spot."
2,I hate this product,I have to disagree with the majority on this one. It's a waist of time. While it does work to remove some stains it just doubles the amount of time it takes me to clean my carpet. I end up have a clean circle so i have to go over my carpet with a full size rug cleaner. For me it is easier just to use my full size hose attachment.Plus it's hard to keep the hose on the manual attachment clean. I have a very messy two year old and ws hoping this product would save me time. I wish I hadn't wasted my money...
3,okay,"This product does an okay job of cleaning the stains but like the other reviews said it leaves a ring. I bought it anyway thinking it wouldn't happen to me but it did. Also it leaves ""clean circles"" thought the carpet. I have a white carpets in my house and you can clearly see where I've used the SpotBot. I would only recommend to homes with dark carpets so you can avoid this phenomenon"
5,Wonderful,"We just love the SpotBot. I works like a charm. It scares the cat, but gets the carpet clean. We would recommend using a spray bottle with cleaner in it rather than the tank to use less of the cleaner since the price can add up. Another reviewer suggested this, so we tried it and it is still efficient. Thanks!"
5,A life-saver!!,"The SpotBot is so awesome! I had 2 aging dogs and it was a constant battle to clean up their accidents, which took forever and never came clean all the way. Now I just set the SpotBot to work and go about my business. The carpet looks better than it did before the accident and takes almost no effort on my part. I don't mind the cost of the cleaners as I figure it sure beats calling out the carpet guys!"
5,It's a good house-cleaning product,My wife likes this product a lot. The only two complaints she has are (1) the cleaning chemicals are expensive and (2) the size of the cleaning spot is sometimes small.
4,"Good product, minor drawbacks","As with any product there is bound to be minor drawbacks. I found this cleaner to have two:1. The solution tank is only good for about 2 cycles (12 minutes) before needing to be refilled. This only becomes a problem if you use expensive cleaning solution. I use various powders that are mixed with water, but keep this in mind when you buy it.2. If you don't go over the spot with the manual brush, you will have a neat circle where the spot bot was. This only takes about 30 seconds to fix, but you have to do it every time. It's kind of annoying.All the same, it does a great job, especially for the money."
5,New Puppy Owner,Highly recommend the Spot Bot for people with small pets and kids. I used this on a set-in poop stain and ran the set-in feature twice and it cleaned like a champ. Can't vouch for the manual hose/brush haven't used it. I am glad I spent the money.
5,This Does What It Says It Will Do!,"This machine is FANTASTIC! It works exactly as they claim it does on the television commercial! It even worked well with set in stains from soy sauce, dog vomit, urine and diarrhea, cigarette ash, and soda! I highly recommend this!"
4,Solid Product,"New off-white carpeting and a sick cat do not make good combos. Tired of hand scrubbing the carpet w/mixed results we opted to try the SpotBot. We are *thrilled* with it.Solidly made product. Easy to set-up. Simple to use. Fortunately have not had to use the deep stain setting - but the 3 minute cycle setting cleaned up all the messes in said time. The set it and forget it way is great when you have other things to do and the beeping upon completion won't allow really forget it.There is also the more manual process w/a hose for stains that don't fit into the circumference of the auto-brushes. That worked well too.Why only 4 stars? I don't have longevity w/the product - and hopefully it won't be used daily, but so far so good."
4,cleans in the shape of mickey mouse ears.,"The SpotBot does a good job cleaning the carpet under it's brushes, and that turns out to be in the shape of Mickey Mouse ears. You can use the detachable hose and brush to do a better merge between cleaned carpet and uncleaned carpet, but it is hard to get the same level of cleaning by hand. Overall I like the unit, but the buyer must be aware that this is for use on small sections of carpet, not a whole carpet."
4,I luv my Spot Bot,"Like many reviewers I purchased the spotbot because of my two cats. While they use their litterbox very well they have that anoying cat thing with throwing up. I had a very good spot cleaner that came in a spray bottle but I would have to scrub and then rinse.I tried my SpotBot for the first time this morning and was surprised by how fast I used the little sample bottle of cleaner that came with it. After I ran out I had an idea that has worked very well. I fill the tank with clear water, spray my uber carpet cleaner out of the bottle on the stain and set the SptoBot on it to scrub and rinse! Works like a charm. Since my carpets are white I will need to get my full size Bissel out and give the carpet a once over. Now I'm headed to the dining room to attack the stains left from holiday entertaining!"
4,Great Machine,I have loved this machine. It really gets up the spots on the carpet and is also great for small furniture clean ups as well. The only complaint I have is the tank runs out really fast and has to be refilled. Other than that it works great!
4,spot remover,I like it however it could extract more water from the carpet . When cycle is complete it is very wet.
4,Love at first spot!,"This was love at first spot! I love this little machine. Having two kids under 3, this little green gem is a must! I cleaned a spot within an hour of it arriving at my door. I wish I had bought it long ago. I only wish it cleaned a bigger spot since throw up, spit up and spills aren't usually confined to a 4"" circle."
2,Didn't last but 18mths,"While it worked it was awesome but after 18 months, the hand held stopped working and the regular rotating brush stopped sending out solution. I am having to treat the area by hand and then let the brushes finish. It has always leaked if you leave the solution container on, so I take it off and set it in a bowl in my utility room.Overall, very diasappointed. I can't believe it didn't last 2 years and I take very good care of my stuff! I'm going to buy the Hoover SteamVac w/Clean surge next. I hear great reviews and it's about the same cost."
1,Worthless,This product was a waste of money. The spray function did not work at all. (I could not return it as I live overseas.) I manually sprayed carpet stains with a spray bottle and the entire unit died after two months of use.
4,spot bot arrived broken,"I enjoy the product...however, the one I received from Amazon was broken. I had to return it to Bissell and wait for a new one to be sent. The new one works well."
1,no spray,"I think this would be a great cleaner, if it would only work.Unfortunately it does not. I am wondering if there has been a defective bunch of them made recently because I just read the review before mine, and the person had 2 units in which the spray funtion would not work. I was really looking forward to using it because I have 5 pets who have frequent accidents. Last night one of them had an accident, and today two of them did ... I think because of the thunder storms they were afraid to go out.It was very frustrating because I repeatedly tried to get it to work. I tried the various recommendations, but the sprayer would not work.I ended up using my cordless bissel 2X spotlifter instead."
1,Not for upholstery,"This product may be great for carpets, but I bought it to use on upholstery, (in particular, the fronts of sofas and chairs where my dog rubs against and soils them) and it isn't satisfactory for that purpose (even though it is listed as one of its uses). To work on small areas, I couldn't narrowly direct the spray of the cleaning solution and ended up drenching areas I didn't want to wet. It was a mess. Easier to do small jobs by hand. I ended up returning it."
2,Left rings and spots,"Unfortunately, I found this product lacking. When I clean with it, there are rings left where each spot had been. I have tried having a professional cleaner come and reclean and the rings came back. I had high hopes for this product, but cannot recommend it."
4,Bissell 1200B SpotBot Hands-Free Compact Deep Cleaner Carpet Cleaner,It's easy to use. Does a great job.
2,SPOT remover,"I was pretty disappointed with this item and returned it. It seemed to only clean like half a circle and the spot size is very small. About 6 "".It would be fine for immediate spot removal."
5,great product,I bought this for a gift my daughter loves it.She says it works just great and like it says it removes even set in carpet stains.
1,Bissell SpotBot true to its name,"The SpotBot does exactly what the name implies - leaves a giant spot on the carpet. I tried it on 4 spots on my berber carpet, and each of the 4 has left a huge spot stain exactly the size of the rotating brush. I have also tried to have the spots removed professionally, to no avail. Don't bother with the SpotBot. Get yourself a scrub brush and some Folex spray."
3,Garbage out of the Box UPDATED,"Purchased spotbot to try and take care of a few small stains. Have heard great things from reviews, etc.. Received spotbot today. Filled up tank with water and cleaner. Plugged it in. No water comes out. None at all.Complete garbage out of the box...Update. Finally got it to work. Had to take it apart.Removes stains pretty well, but uses a TON of cleaning solution, and tends to leave small circles where you have used it. They do fade after a while, and no, I am not talking about clean spots. Just noticeable areas of use."
2,Too complicated,"This product is far too complicated for its own good. If all one wants to do is clean a stain, why does one need an intricate set of automatic settings? What's the point? The older SpotCleaner, which Bissell no longer sells, was much easier to use, more portable, less bulky, less costly. Complexity for its own sake is just silly."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,Used this machine on a few pet stains with the enclosed liquids. All it did was make a mess!
1,crap,"we bought this right after replacing carpets in our house to help keep them clean. well after using the machine on our brand new carpet, we now have 3 mis colored rings in our living room floor. we are going to either have to buy a better hard core steamer or replace carpets again. i was surprised to see so many great reviews on this."
4,Great product,"I gave my dad a spot bot for Christmas and we tried it out right away. It really cleared away one set in stain and another it just helped with. I'm sure it will do great with fresh stains. It's fast, not too noisy, and it's so nice to let a machine do all the scrubbing for you. Worth it!"
4,best pet stain cleaner I've used,"This is the absolute best stain cleaner I've ever used! I have dogs & cats, & nothing comes close to getting out pet stains than the Spot Bot. It even gets out stains that I have overlooked and have set in.I would have given this a 5 star, but the ONLY drawback is that it leaves the area that's just been cleaned very wet. I almost always have to use the manual hose to suck up the excess water after the cleaning cycle--which , for me, defeats the whole ""hands-free, walk away"" cleaning.Other than that, I really do love this product!"
3,ring,Ilike it except it leaves aring where you clean when using the handsfree system then you have to work to get rid of that
3,Great but has some issues,"This is a great hands free carpet cleaner but does have some kinks to work out (we did buy this brand new). After a few months, it started to leak in areas and has slowly become worse. We have also had issues with the hose becoming clogged and the solution not coming out. Unless you have a handyman around to fix it when it breaks down...I'd wait until something better comes out because this has been a pain constantly needing to be fixed!"
1,wish it worked,"Just brought it home..... out of the box and it doesn't work! call Bissell, they say to call the service center, not return it to the store. The service center says it will take 4-6 weeks for them to fix it, so take it back to the store. They rudely informed me they didn't want it and to lie if I have to, so the store will take it back. $120 and they all act like I'm the one at fault and too stupid to work it....UUGGGHHHH!!!"
3,handy gadget but not as easy as you think,"The spotbot works pretty much as advertized, although you may find that over time you get dirty circles where you've previously cleaned. I'm told that the cleaning agents used aren't completely cleaned off, and that over time they attact dirt.After I run the spotbot I take some plain water in a sprayer and soak the area, then run the manual attachment to clean up the water. In this way it takes a lot longer before the cleaned areas get noticeable circles."
3,TAKES AWAY THE SMELL BUT LEAVES A SPOT,It is great in getting rid of the puppy urine but left a nice round spot. I still had to run a shampooer but didn't have to get it out quite as often.
1,manual mode DOA from the factory,"Just bought this item, and have used it exactly once. The automatic mode worked like a champ, but as many reviews have said, it leaves the carpet wet, so we tried to use the manual mode to suck up the excess water as reviews had suggested. Unfortunately, manual mode didn't work; the manual mode light just blinks and the machine refuses to start. Digging around on the Internet shows this to be a fairly common problem, supposedly involving the switch detecting when you've removed the hose from the unit. I've written to Bissel Customer Support, but may just end up returning the unit to Amazon since it's clearly defective as it came from the factory. Needless to say, the first impression in not good."
5,Bissell SpotBot,This is an awesome little machine. I bought it after I brought four puppies into my home. It works great on all the little messes they leave behind - even if they dry - even if left for several days. I just recently started adding the OxyGen - makes the machine work even better. I couldn't live without it.
4,User Friendly Device,"I love my Spot Bot. I have used it both for manual & automatic cleaning. My only complaint is that I would like to have a hard hose, so I can stand up straight when I clean."
5,AWESOME!! Early Christmas Gift,"This little unit is just great! I bought this for my wife for Christmas. However, 2 weeks before Christmas, our dog got very sick. Let's just say.....I would not want to be that carpet. Due to the emergency, my wife opened her gift early.Within a few minutes I had the entire mess cleaned up with NO ODER LEFT BEHIND! I then turned to the carpet mats in my minivan, which i thought were stained for life. When I was finished, they were like new!!I highly recommend the SPOTBOT to anyone with kids or pets!"
5,A Massive Time (and Carpet) Saver,"I'll keep it brief as most of what I going to say has been said many times already.I bought this after getting a new kitten and it's saved a lot of hard work on numerous occasions. This should also translate in to a reduction in loss of deposit after we move out of this apartment.I would highly recommend this product.Suggestions for (minor) improvements:1) Should have a retractable power cord.2) The cleaning fluid tank should have a flat top, so when you're filling it you can just stand it in the sink.3) The beeping after the cleaning cycle has finished should stop a short time."
5,This machine has probably saved our dogs life a time or two...,"Got Puke? Pee? Messes? Spills?Have Kids? Pets? Are you a bit of a klutz?Then you NEED this machine. It works well for cleaning up any of the messes life brings you. I don't doubt we use this for something at least 5-6 times each week. I also use the manual mode to clean up larger messes or the carpets in my van. Before I had this one, I had the Bissell Litte Green Machine. I loved that one too. We used it so much over the course of a couple years that it finally just tuckered out. We replaced that with this one. My husband even commented he loved it and that it was worth the money. That says alot! You can't go wrong with Bissell's Compact Deep Cleaners."
2,A MUST have if you have Pets and Stairs,"I purchased this cleaner recently to use on the pet stains and the stairs. The fact that it works on spots, and has a attachment so that you can do stairs and high traffic areas such as door ways makes this unit worth every cent. I did one pet spot on the carpet, leaving me with a extremely clean circle, which only demonstrated how dirty the rest of the carpet was. I also plan on using it on the car seats etc."
4,Love my SpotBot,I bought this one as a gift and got one later for myself. Great for spot cleaning b/c you can set and walk away. Cleaning solutions can get expensive.
5,Its a Miracle!,"I have two new puppies, and paper training is tough! This machine is a miracle worker with my carpet. I have used it quite a bit and am very pleased how stains just disappear!!!The only downside is, sometimes, the water solution mix drains out incredibly fast, leaving a very very very saturated area, and wasting my whole solution! Then other times, it behaves as it should, and it is fine. I cant figure out why it is doing that...... I still gave 5 stars for its cleaning abilities, but was tempted for 4.... Because this is annoying when it happens."
1,Piece of junk,"Four of us have bought the product about 9 months ago--It did its job cleaning--However the machine within 9 months for all of us came apart. The four screws on the top that hold the top cover on break the plastic holders inside--Therefore there is nothing tight to hold things in place. It is totally unfixable with out replaceing the entire top--They do not sell the part--nor could all the electrical parts be reconnected. So enjoy your product for nine months then you too will have a piece of junk!!!!!!!All four of the machines broke in the same way. Surely they could have made a longer lasting case!!!BISSELL Spotbot Pet Handsfree Spot and Stain Cleaner with Deep Reach Technology, 33N8A"
2,Leaking problem,"We purchased this product as a replacement for one we had and used over several years to clean dog spots. However, this one leaks out the soapy water from the tank. We got a replacement and it does to. Beware of where you store it."
3,Forget the automatic feature - but the hand held works great.,"We have used this for over three years now and still works well. We first tried the automatic hands-free ""Spot Bot"" feature and thought it was great - but found that it did not adequately extract the cleaning fluids - and also created circle ""hickies"" in the carpet.It would be great if they just did the hand wand at a lower cost."
5,problem with arthritis in hands,"I am completely pleased with the SpotBot Hands Free. I have grandchildren, cats and dogs in my house and of course I have a lot of spots, I have arthritis in both hands and cann't hold a brush tight enought to scrub spots on carpet and furniture. The SpotBot is a life savers for me. It is all plus more than I had expected."
5,Terrific for small stains,"This is a terrific carpet cleaner for small spills and pet stains. Just set it down on the stain, add the cleaning solution, and press a button. It has a light-duty setting for recent spills, or a heavy-duty setting for set-in stains. Either way, it does a great job of cleaning and drying the carpet. I've owned it for a few months now, and I'm really happy with it. The only thing you need to watch for is if your carpet is dirty, you'll end up with a light circle where this cleaner has been.The instructions for this carpet cleaner calls for a special cleaning solution, not the standard cleaning solution that's used in full-size machines. All I need is yet another cleaning solution at home. Instead, I've been diluting the full-strength solution by adding two parts water to one part full-strength solution, then following the instructions for mixing solution and water for this machine. Works fine for me."
4,Some things the manual doesn't tell you,"I've had my SpotBot over a year now and have learned a few tricksthe manual doesn't address. If your clean spot is to wetsimply put the hand tool on the hose and suck up the remainingliquid. A lot of people seem to have trouble with these units notworking for very long. I've learned that if you clean the unitafter use you'll have no problems. Heres what I do. Drain andrefill supply tank with fresh cold water. Remove hose turn on manual and spray till you get cold water. Then remove tank andspray till water stops.Now fill SINK with clean water. Still on manual suck up water till recovery tank is full. Empty and repeat. This cleans the hose. Then check clear plastic suction units (2) on buttom of unit. remove and clean if necesary.Also remove and rinse the rubber seal on buttom of recoverytank.One other trick, The Upholstery Power Brush from a full size Bissell carpet cleaner will fit and work with a SpotBot."
3,"works great, but doesnt last","I fixed the product once, now it doesnt suction water again. its been 2 yrs. We have used it no more then 20x."
4,Does the job while you do other things,"What a great device for anyone that has a dog or cat. I no longer get upset when accidents happen. The SpotBot get rids of stains in 3 minutes or less. If it has a con: is that at times it cleans the spot too well and the rest of the carpet looks dirty. I recommend using just simple hot water and baking soda on spots. Stronger stuff was causing ""clean"" rings.I wish I owned one years ago. It removed old stains that were there for months."
5,Well pleased,"Great little cleaner. Very easy to use and takes minutes for a super spot clean. The spot bot is such a good cleaner that the area around the spot that was cleaned completely different. It looks like there is a circle of new carpet placed in the middle of my floor.Cons: The all purpose ""little green formula"" (8oz) they give the buyer lasts 1 1/2 deep cleans. I have not used the other oxy trial cleaner yet."
3,Works Good,"I really like this machine. It's nice to let it do the work for you. I haven't had any tough stains yet, but I've gotten up all the ones I haven't had time to get to. I did think it was a little on the pricey side, but I suppose you are paying for convenience too. I was dissapointed to learn that the ""storage tray"" is an accessory that can be purchased separately for another $13. From the way the manual reads, it should be included. Customer Service told me that marketing was ""working on that problem"". I'm not sure exactly what that meant, either editing the user's guide or including it to begin with. Probably the former. Anyway, it works great especially if you don't have time to get on your hands and knees to scrub the carpet."
1,Did not work out of the box,"The one I received was very poorly made. Out of the box, the scrubbing brushes/head would not turn. It had been poorly assembled, but after disassembling and re-assembling the scrubbing head and getting the gears to mesh, the scrubbing function started to work. The next problem was that it will not spray. I tried all of the on-line solutions to this somewhat common problem (see FAQ Answer ID 443 of 10/27/2006), but it still would not spray. If I manually pour the cleaning solution into the carpeting, it does do a good job of scrubbinbg and vacuming out stains automatically. I wanted this to work, but would not buy one on-line for fear of getting a defective one like mine."
3,Deep Cleaner capret cleaner,Awesome for those really messy parties. Nothing else works nearly as well without professional help! An asset to any house.
1,Creates Even More Work -- Save Your Money!,"If I could give this '0' stars I would... what a waste of money and time! This does a good job of cleaning one tiny spot, then you are left with an area in your carpet noticably lighter than the other areas. So when you try to even it out by moving the Spotbot to the surrounding areas, you are left with a polka dot effect that I spent two days on my hands and knees trying to even out... this thing is headed straight for the dumpster, after I get over all the money I wasted!"
1,"Out, Out Damn SpotBot","The SpotBot seemed great. I have a 10 month old daughter who is always dropping or grinding food into the carpet. I bought my SpotBot 6 days ago and it worked pretty good (if you don't mind bright clean ""polka dots"" dotting your room). After breakfast, I put the SpotBot down and it quit working on the second spot. The automatic feature quit. The machine would only beep at me with all of its lights flashing. Bissell customer service says this is a ""most unusual problem"" and authorized me to send it to them for service. I do not have 6 day old purchases serviced. I returned it to the store for a refund and I am looking for a different machine.In the interest of fairness, please note that I bought a 1200 model and it seems that it has been superceded by the 1200B (at least online)."
1,Really Wished it would work!,"After reading the high marked posts about this machine I purchased one, took it home, first tried the short cycle, didn't pick up the spot, not a real tough spot either, so then did the 'set in stain' setting(twice as long as regular cycle). Well it appeard to get most of the spot out, but left alot of the water/cleaner in the carpet which spread out, then it dried over nite, then I had a bigger spot! This machine is a good idea, but Bissell did NOT finish the job, brushes move REAL SLOW, and the vacuum part is really whimpy so it leaves lots of liquid in the carpet to spread out the stain and not pick it up.. Oh well, I'm returning it, maybe Hoover will come out with a good one...love the idea though.."
3,Bissell SpotBot,"Initially, I was very impressed with this product. But---a few days after cleaning my carpet and the areas drying--I could still see the spots I thought I had ""thoroughly"" cleaned. I still prefer my large Bissell steam cleaner. I guess size does truly matter!!!"
5,Can't say enough good about it,"I can't say enough about my SpotBot. I have a dog and a cat, and both have a real knack for vomiting on the carpet instead of my tiled rooms. The SpotBot ALWAYS gets the spot out. Amazing, given that my carpet is very light tan, and the spot usually bright orange. Per the recommendation of previous reviewers, I use spray bottles for the Little Green and oxygen cleaner -- rather than putting those solutions into the machine's reservoir. To repeat what so many others have said (and thank goodness they did, encouraging me to buy one)... EVERY pet owner should have one of these! Very highly recommended."
3,I got the lemon,"I think I will like the item. But it is in the repair shop. I have not had a chance to use it yet. It failed to dispense the cleaning solution. Everything else worked but no fluid. I called Customer service, very nice, walked me thru all the steps but nothing worked. They gave me the name of the closest repair shop and that is where my Christmas gift to myself is now. Have no idea how much this will cost me...but I am still looking forward to using this carper cleaner someday."
3,Good for Spots,"If you are looking to ONLY clean a spot then this little tool works fine, if you have small children or a pet problem, then this may be what you are looking for. But from my perspective, for a few dollars more you can purchase a carpet cleaner that will clean not only spots but the whole carpet. I feel it's just not very practical."
1,Whaaaaa???????,"Well, well, well. I liked the first couple levels that reminded me of the classic. Then it got rediculous, and I was fighting legions of undead because the programmers decided to GIVE THE NAZIS A HOLIDAY and let invincible Zombies murder me instead.So much for the good ol' revenge shooter. Is it just me, or is killing zombies kinda redundant? I mean, they're already dead, and don't make for a villian that makes me go, ""Woo hoo!"" when I've killed them.Basically the programmers COULDN'T DECIDE WHETHER TO MAKE DOOM 3 OR WOLFENSTEIN first, and decided to slap the two together.You basically have here WOLFEN-DOOM, complete with an INVINCIBLE ARMY OF NAZI JUGGERNAUTS, and a legion of INVINCIBLE NAZI ZOMBIES.But I liked it. You should check out the demo or something."
1,Save your money,"Save your money, RTCW is the latest overrated dissappointing first person shooter to come out. AI? None. Graphics? Quake Plot? Essentially none. Major step backwards from HalfLife and Unreal. Still trying to figure out how I was imprisoned in a nazi castle yet got my mission objectives. The graphics are incredibly dissapointing. There was no sense of discovery and the unknown like in Halflife. The AI was nonexistent (when you get to the guard behind the bullet-proof glass and you jump up and down and shoot at him and he just stands there you will understand). If you have nothing better to do I guess it will provide the first person shooter fix, but you will be left dissapointed. Play Halflife again, it is more fun even the second time."
2,more of the same...,"The graphics are nice, very smooth (with my graphics card anyway, can't say for yours) and the single-player levels are innovative. Compared to some of the older FPSs out there like quake and unreal the levels are interesting and fun. About on par with half life or HALO. Multiplayer beats the older generation of games, but is about on par with some of the shareware half-life mods. I've noticed that most of the people that really rave about it don't play many of the newer games, though your results may vary. As far as I can see, nothing new here."
3,Not as good as Medal of Honor Allied Assualt,"Medal of Honor beats it in Graphics, Gameplay, Control and every other catagory other then Blood. It has alot of Blood which is funner but you can also download blood for MOHAA."
4,Questionable game plot.,"Whos idea was it to through zombies, nazis and cyborgs into one installment of Wolfenstein. At times it feels like playing 3 seperate games, like a coctail of concepts encapsuled in a familiar game logo.For the fellow who thought the game was difficult, try aiming for the head (they die quicker that way).Yah and the Uber Soldats are panzies with A.I. of a grasshoper (hint: it can't shoot you if it is chasing you around a corner of a wall or a pillar, exposing it's ""unarmed"" left arm to your fire). One can kill them by the dozens with out getting harmed.One last rant, even though it proved to offer a diverse pallet of enemies through out the game. Most battles revolved around 1 to 3 enemy units. I want larger numbers of units outnumbering me. Rather then 1 or 2 guys with 1000 hit points. Get an entire platoon after me ( I am a peoples person realy )."
5,Return to Castle Wolfenstein,"I just finished the best game of 2001. I've read other reviews and comments by the critics and quite frankly I don't understand how they can't give it the best game of 2001. I've only played the single player thusfar and it has lived up to my expectations. Superb graphics, sound, weaponery, and story line. I was a huge fan of Max Payne before sitting down to Return to Castle Wolfenstein, but now I believe this is the best game of the year. All of this before even trying the Multi-Player. Wow, two games in one. Do yourself a favor and go out and get this game today."
5,Best game of the YEAR!,"I was turned on to this game by a friend and have played the demo for a month stright! The setting is very real , I can only think what landing on the beach was like for my grandaddy till this game. When the Nazi's open up with the big guns and the ground shakes and the sound is screaming from my speakers I think this is pretty close! the demo is great and playing the real ppl on line was the best"
2,Great Idea - Poor Execution,"Maybe the game had too much hype, but after nearly completing the single player and playing the multi-player for several weeks, I am rather disappointed. The single player missions for the most part are boring and repetitive. I'm comparing it to Half-Life and it is nowhere even close to the quality of the single player. What is really shocking are the graphic defects present in the game - guns appearing through walls, dead soldiers hovering a few feet above ground, some cheesy AI, but better than most. The multiplayer is much more enjoyable, and uses many of the single player maps. I'll be selling it and buying Medal of Honor when it comes out."
5,It is fun and that is all that matters,"The fact that this game could have possibly been a mod, (and they are current mods/games that are similar) does not take anything away from this game. The single player is good fun, although short. The multiplayer is class base and is reminiscent of the TFC series, but the graphics and the theme is what is entertaining. The gameplay is smooth, and for the most part balanced, and it is clear when a official SDK comes out the mod and map potential for this game is almost limitless. Its ties to the original is loose, and even if it didn't have the name of Wolfenstein, it would still sell as it has. I can only say this, the game is fun and that is all that matters"
4,Typical 3D Shooter,"Good game, nothing really ground breaking. Soldier of Fortune & Half-Life are better."
4,XP/3Dfx Voodoo owners beware!,"You will have to take non-trivial steps to get this game to work.The game requires DirectX 8.0a+. Windows XP ships with DirectX8.1 and 3Dfx Voodoo drivers, but those drivers do not support DirectX8 at all.Believe it or not, Voodoo owners are now reduced to picking among about a dozen sets of drivers written by ""3rd parties"" (quotes because it's very hard to tell whether or not any of them are reliable at all and/or have security problems)."
2,REALLY violent,"Alot of people are going to say that two stars is unfair for a game that has such great graphics and playability...i understand where you're coming from if you think that, because this game looks great and is VERY fun. But it is way too graphically violent for me. I dont have anything against shooting games in general, I love Counter Strike and IGI, and Unreal Tournament was good back in the day, but Wolfenstein ups the ante way beyond simple kill and be killed gameplay, going to extremes like depictions of torture and mutilation. Even though i can spend hours shooting enemies in the head while playing Medal of Honor, and enjoy lopping off limbs in Rune, playing Castle Wolfenstein is, for me, completely demoralizing and dehumanzing. I dont play it because of that, and any game I wont play can't get better than two stars.By the way, this game is banned in Germany. But that might just be because of the anti-German sentiment as much as the violence."
2,"It's decent, but it's not worth upgrading your computer for.","In my opinion, I wasted my money upgrading my computer at a cost of nearly $600 to play this game in it's 'full glory.' Although it is a nice game, it certainly doesn't live up to any hype and in many aspects it feels like a rehash of Doom and the Quake series....I spent $350 on an Xbox and Halo, and I can say without a doubt that was the best investment I ever made in the games industry."
4,This game is really good! By Gamemaster Jason,"This game looks amazing! When I got this game I realized the graphics were pretty good for a computer. I love the new weapons in the game even though they could have added a bit more. The game however is a bit short, so I beat the game in no time with the help of a few friends for some of the puzzles. The thing that is really good is the graphics and the the totally awesome multiplayer mode. I love it! My only wish is that it comes out for my XBOX, PS2, OR GAMECUBE. Activision did a good job in the making of this game and in seems to be sucessful. I was a big fan of wolfenstein 3d having beat the last boss guy that says something in German when He sees you. After you escape, you give a loud whoop of joy and it was over..Boring! This game is awesome and I recommend you to get this game.Graphics 4Sound 4Gameplay 2Satisfaction 5overall 4 (not averaged)Greatest Gaming MomentBeating the game three times in a row.Time played: 10+hours"
3,"Fun, but not the original Wolfenstein 3D","When I bought this game, I was hoping for an unchanged redo of the original Wolfenstein. I was wrong, but the new Wolfenstein is a fun game. To run this game, you need an up-to-date computer, with various ""cards"" to run the new Wolfenstein. The fun I have so far had playing this, is no where near the fun of the original Wolfenstein. Plus, the new Wolfenstein cost a lot of money.Save you money! Get the original Wolfenstein off of Amazon.com. You will have saved your money, AND be playing a much better game."
3,"Beta 2 okay, but whats all the fuss","Since Beta 1, they have solved most of the annoying problems, and added new annoying problems. The actual game play is much better now, with other connections not interrupting your own, and I like the axis vs. allies, and assortment of men that can be played. This is only slightly more fun than Quake III as a multiplayer game. Verdict, fun at first, but after a couple of weeks it just becomes another 3D shoot-em up."
3,Hard Eye Candy,"I really looked forward to this game. It is now gathering dust. I don't have a broadband connection, so the multiplayer aspect is useless to me. The single-player missions start off hard, and quickly get to the ""yeah, right"" difficulty level. I hate to cheat to win, but I found that I had to go into god mode early and often just to get through. I have not finished this one, and I bet I never will. The graphics are state-of-the-art, but the gameplay is seriously lacking. Get Medal of Honor instead. I didn't have to cheat to beat that one."
3,Wait For The Patch,"From what I have played I love the game but it crashes constantly, even on the ""stable"" Windows XP. For what I paid for it it should work right out of the box and not need a patch. Wait a month, a patch will probably be out and it'll probably be cheaper too."
3,Not great.,I heard a lot of great reviews of this game and I have to say I was disappointed. If you want Quake frag fest this is your game. If you want real WWII FPS play Day of Defeat Half Life mod. No one even comes close to DOD in terms of realisim and pure enjoyment. Single player is boring after playing online.
5,Very happy,This is the second game that I have purchased from this site. I have to say that I am extremely please with the promptness and quality of the used game.
4,Sweet game,"This game was really fun, i have a [bad] internet connection or i would play the multiplayer mod even more. The only problem is it has little to no replay value. It is great while it last and takes quite a while to beat. I would deffinetly reccomend this game to anyone with a high speed internet connection. This game has excellent graphics, i have a Geforce 4 64 MB and it looks great! Its always nice blowing away a few...before you have to go to class. The sound in this game is also excellent, you can actually hear the knife going in...when you stab them in the beggining scene. If you are a true gamer you got to have this game in your library."
4,Almost perfect,"I'll make this brief. Graphics, gameplay and storyline were all great. The annoying interface was not. Believe it or not, I was so annoyed with the save and load menus that it sort of spoiled the experience. Saving was annoying because when I quicksaved, the game reloaded where it wanted to, not where I had last quicksaved. Saving normally was annoying because I had to click on my save game file over and over to make the game recognize the filename and save over it. Other than that, I did enjoy the game, though the WWII genre is getting old after playing a few of the games out there. I do recommend this game to people who aren't easily annoyed."
1,Huh? Are you people blind?,"Ok, first of all the ideas for Castle Wolfenstein are not new. Download a free copy Day of Defeat and you'll see where Castle Wolfenstein got the ideas for it's ""New"" game....I'm a diehard fan of the Wolfenstein, Doom, Quake line, and if I don't see something better soon I'll have to place this game with my Quake 3 (yawn) -in the trash."
1,Pretty good but hardware raping,"Yeah its a pretty good game and i've played the mp testdemo very much the last weeks, but im afraid that my hardware is not capable of this game. Ive got an athlon 1400 and gf2gts, and when im outside in the beachmap my frames run down to 30, no matter if i choose low detail or high.I hope it's because of the beta status, if not i wonder what id did with the q3 engine.........."
2,i was disappointed with the multiplayer demo...,"it was more like a really good quake 3 mod than a game. it's actually funny how they use the ""quad-damage"" model for when a person is on fire. anyway... don't buy this game... although i loved the original i believe that this will be a let down. just wait until Medal of Honor: Allied Assult comes out."
4,Fantastic game,"Easily the most addictive game I have played. I mainly stick with multiplayer but I have also tried playing the single player game, but find myself bored after awhile. The single player isn't the best and honestly I find the supernatural aspect of it tiresome. Because of that I lessened my rating from 5 stars to 4.The multiplayer is phenomenal. The most fun I've had in a multiplayer game. I highly recommend this game for anyone who loves multiplayer games."
3,return to castle wolfenstine,It is the same game as Castle wolfestine just better graphics what a joke....
2,Paying for a mod,"It's pretty sad that anyone would actually pay for this game. Yeah, it MIGHT have a good single player game. The multiplayer so far, is sorta lame. Just a rip off from CTF basically.And the game itself is only a damned MOD. The graphics aren't impressive at all, not compared to others FPS that are out right now.And the flame thrower is pathetic. Check out the Unreal 2 one. Much more realistic and impressive.I'd just save my money for Unreal 2, or another game, which uses a modern engine, not a mod for an old engine which was only half way decent to begin with."
2,Mulitplayer is nothing new,"I bought this game primarily for the multiplayer action, and they really didn't reinvent the wheel. Similar to any game with ""Classes"", like Half Life mods Day of Deafeat and Team Fortress. Although the game is visually stunning, the grapics don't make the game play any better."
5,Not hard on hardware,"I have an Athlon 500 and a mid-range graphics card and the game looked smooth and beautiful. The fire and explosion effects were stunning and the sound was very good. I'll buy this game, which says a lot, since I've purchased 3 games this year."
5,RTCW - Can't wait for the retail version,I have been literally hooked on the multiplayer test version. Although this test version only runs a single scenario (beach assault) I find myself hitting the pillow well after midnight. I have been a Wolfenstein gamer since the very first FPS game from Apogee. The utilization of the Q3 engine with this game makes similar games pale in comparison. I am extremely anxious for the Nov. 6 release. I WANT MY WOLF-EN-STEIN!!!
3,Not your father's Wolfenstein,"Pros: Stunning graphics; interesting single-player missions; fun multiplayer.Cons: Apparently only the Allies could afford lightbulbs; single-player lacks the cathartic ""kill 'em all"" flavor of the original; way too much sneaking around needed; ""smart"" enemies aren't; mouse-keyboard control system takes a lot of getting used to; maybe a little too realistic."
5,David Arkenstone - In the Wake of the Wind,"The first time I heard of David Arkenstone was this past summer when my high school band director gave us the music for our show this year. We performed Voyage of the Stardancer: Overture, Stardancer, Lion's Breath, Morning Sun on the Sails, Through the Gates, and Sailing. It's not the usual music you hear a marching band performing, but it worked. As the season went on, I grew to really like the music, and wanted to hear more of it. The CD has completly different versions of the songs. The melody is all the same, but all the selections are longer and have a different feel some of the time. I actually like the versions on the CD better because they're softer, and more relaxing. You can usually hear the Irish background in the music, but it comes out really clear in Through the Gates. If you even slightly like the feel of Irish music, you should definatly listen to this! It's so awesome, and so worth getting it."
4,quite nice,"When I am in the right mood, it is very nice. Made me realize how predictable most music is. These sounds seem random."
2,Moderately Useful,"Although there is some useful and interesting information in the book, the author is more interested in pressing his environmental agenda than in compiling scholarly information on the Green Man. I was annoyed by his constant preaching. I'm sure there must be better books on this subject than this one."
3,interesting and different but,i like the part in ghosts are greedy where the devil starts talking lol.are these guys tribal or satan worshipers?anyway the music is decent mixed in with wierd stuff.i think the album farewell to hightide and omphalos from the album homb are more accessible.
5,Wonderful,"This CD is one of my top favorites, I have to force myself to turn it off so as not to get weary of it and spoil its magic. It has depth. It is a lot more than just a guitar to give a full, beautiful sound. I'm not totally in love with all the tracks, but 1, 4, & 6 stand out as excellent. One can get lost in this music."
5,Dr. Hook,"The best of Shel Silverstein. He drew for playboy, he wrote & drew many childrens books, and wrote many Dr. Hook songs.Even if you aren't a fan of Dr. Hook music you still can't beat the lyrics. He is witty & creative with few to compare by."
5,the worlds group,"dr hook was only the greatest, most versatile group of their century. they seemed to play anything well, from dope to love songs, and the love songs were always from the heart. no other group has ever come close to their talents. its a shame that they had to break up. i too this day still go and see dr hook featuring ray sawyer whenever they play, and at their age, they still rock."
1,What are the songs on this CD?,It is probably a great CD but sence I don't know what is on it I can't say. Discriptions of a CD should indlude the list of songs on the CD.
2,Peterson's Colleges in the South,"I was very disappointed with the content of this book. True it did give provide the hard facts such as how many students, how many faculty, majors available, $/semester hour etc, but it was sorely lacking on describing the philosophy of the college. There was no information indicating the degree of liberalism or conservatism. There wasn't even a description of the degree or lack thereof of the ethnic diversity found on the campus. Before I will even think of attending a specific college I will want to know how the college mind set will complement, expand, or terrorize my own. This book did not provide any information in that area to help me with my selection."
5,best in the series,I thought this book was the best in the making out series. A definite to add to your collection.
3,Great series...not so great book,"I love this series! It's so addicting and the characters are great. I wasn't very impressed with this book, though. Even though the series is kinda soap opera-y this book went over the edge. One too many crazy things happened on Halloween, but I still reccomend this series to anyone who likes fast paced reads and lots of drama!"
3,An interesting episode in the lifes of teenages,"At last Christopher and Aisha are a couple, but when she receives a phone call from her ex, old feeling are brought to the surface. I did not find this book to be one of my favorites but it was good all the same."
1,I LOVE THIS SERIES BUT...,"I love this series and I've read them all, [if you want to find #1-28, go to amazon.co.uk] but I hate this one. I mean, c'mon, Aisha gets mugged, gets amnesia, and thinks shes 14 again. this one is definetly my least favorite. however, the rest of the series is awesome."
3,"Pretty good book, could have been a little better","OK, I definetly agree with what the ""one reader from canada"" had to say. This was definetly one of the better books in the series. But I do have to say that i like Benjamin and Nina together. The whole thing about Aisha not wanting to tell Christopher about what happened in the past, was kind of inevitable. I mean if she is going to take him to a concert where her ex-boyfriend is gonna be, things are gonna be brought back from ole memory lane. I do wish that Claire had stayed to tell the real Sean what she was thinking. Instead of being her usual shallow, self-serving self. Ok my two cents!!!"
4,Aisha returns to the past...,"Aisha loses her memory in Boston, her old home. Will she lose Christopher because of what happened with Jeff? I actually read this book in the 'Making Out' series, but what the heck, it's the same thing. This book is really good because it has flashbacks which is very interesting."
2,"Great material, poor movie","The premise of this movie is interesting and compelling, the potential for a great dramatic story was there, but the movie is very lame. With better acting and (yes) better direction, this could have been a masterpiece. Instead, I think it's little more than a wasted opportunity. Don't expect anything even remotely close to the Bicycle Thief or Umberto D. This is nothing more than a 1970s melodrama with excellent but badly developed social contents. It's not surprising that this movie is not as well known as other De Sica's movies. If you are planning on watching a limited number of neo-realist movies, my recommendation is do skip this one and go for the earlier path-breaking masterpieces."
2,A Brief Vacation,"Italian director Vittorio De Sica returns to my newsletter. THE BICYCLE THIEF, AFTER THE FOX, and this. This one's 1973, Italian with English subtitles, in color. The premise is ""sickness is the vacation of the poor."" Clara has a lousy husband and a lousy job, but some lung damage sends her to the sanatorium in the mountains. I like the premise. I grew up in the ""work til you drop"" culture, and in fact I'm still fighting to reprogram myself.I really wanted to like this movie, as a De Sica fan, but it was boring. The acting was surprisingly bad, and the opening 50 minutes in the factory were so cliche. I waited for the part in the hospital, hoping it was ""the good part."" Nah, just some eccentrics and a romantic interest. A few good performances, largely wasted. I've seen movies excel with less, but this one just didn't pull it off. But on the plus side, the scenery was great."
4,Window Fan,The fan is a little loud on high but it really does the trick cooling off the house so I can sleep at night without the AC on. I would recommend this item to anyone who lives in the hotter climates and doesn't want to run their AC all the time and pay the electricity price for it.
4,"This fan is awesome, but a little loud.","I bought the Lasko Air Director because of it's pivoting feature. My bedroom window is an an odd angle to my bed, and the fan can be turned to direct air exactly where I need it. It's powerful and moves a lot of air. My only complaint is that it is very loud, even on low I have to turn my television up to ridiculous volumes to be able to hear it over the fan. Other than that and the fact that there is no reverse motor feature to draw air out (you have to manually turn the fan around in the window), I would have given a five star rating."
4,Pretty Good Fan,"I also have a larger Lasko fan so the noise level is not too loud for me. My one beef is the description say ""Reverses for exhaust air intake"". This means you take the fan out of the window, turn it 180 degrees and reinsert the fan in the window - I had to laugh! My other Lasko fan has a motor that reverses which is much less hassle. I would have returned it but I couldn't find any other problems with the fan."
3,"Same as the old one you might remember, excepting the noise.","The fan is the same as the old Air Director, complete with the packaging, but they cheaped out recently and made the fanblades smaller. This still pushes a lot of air, but it pushes somewhat less air and is higher pitched than the old. If you have an old version of this fan, DO NOT THROW IT AWAY. By removing the six screws on the back, you can extract the better fanblade from it. Then, do the same to the new fan (being mindful this will probably kill whatever warranty existed on the new one) and stick the old fanblade on the new one. Now the new fan will sound and behave like the original Air Director. Besides that, this fan is still (mostly) the king of window fans--it may only be manually reversible, but it's much larger than most piddly box-shaped ones and blasts like a tornado."
3,Not 14 inches,"This fan BLOWS! In a good way. It's super powerful, and is a bit loud, but it gets the job done. It's just not at all 14 inches. The box says that it fits a 19 inch window, and the design is strange. I'm still using it, but not in a window. It's much too large. But the base allows it to stand up on the floor, so that seems to be working well."
2,Improved?,"Bought this ""same"" fan several years ago at a local Aubuchon Hardware and it has been working flawlessly since. Then last weekend, my wife decided to take it apart and clean (over zealously, apparently) the dust off of the blades, and broke one.After searching several stores locally and finding their selections to be lacking in design or just plain junk, we decided to order the ""same"" fan again. It arrived today and I agree with many of these other reviews...it is loud! Much louder than our old one. Upon closer examination it appears that Lasko has re-designed the blades. Our old fan had larger blades and resembled the fan pictured on the box. This new fan's blades seem about one third smaller (narrower). Suspect this may be the cause of the additional noise.We are not returning it because of the need for a fan now and because the last one was so good... but are still searching for the right one."
3,Lasko airdirector window fan is OK,"The fan is loud and makes a big breeze, even on the lowest setting, but it does move a lot of air and really cools the room down. The only thing holding it in the window is a little cut-out on the top, and I have to be careful when changing the air direction not to flip it out from under the window sash, but it's nice to point the air where I want it.I wish it had a quieter, lower setting, but it'll do."
1,Unsatisfactory,"This fan is extremely loud. The low setting is louder than the high setting on comparable fans. The plastic case looks and feels very cheap. Pieces fit together poorly and the switch sticks out unattractively from the case. However, in my opinion, $35 + shipping is not cheap for a simple fan. It was not reviewed at the time I bought it so I hoped for the best.I bought the fan from Creative Products. Their return policy requires a 15% re-stocking fee unless you exchange it for another product of equal or greater cost. This was disclosed. However, in the future, I will not buy anything that is not well-reviewed from a vendor that charges a re-stocking fee."
2,Noisy Noisy Noisy,"This fan seems like it is well constructed but man, is it NOISY. I can barely hear myself think when I've got it running -- even at the low speed. Seems like with all those decibels it generates this little jet engine should be displacing a lot of air, but in fact it seems to do only a modest job of moving the breeze in or out the room. Kind of a disappointment actually."
4,"Versatile fan, fits in small windows","This fan is great for fitting into smaller windows that those big window fans won't fit in. It also works great as a floor fan, and has 3 speeds ranging from basically high, very high and super high. Great for moving air, but can be noisy, so if you want a quiet fan, keep looking. It fits my needs perfectly, fitting in a smaller than normal window to pull fresh air into a stuffy room. Its pivoting action is great to point the air directly where you want it."
3,great blowing fan - but does NOT work as an exhaust fan,"My bathroom exhaust fan went out. This fan was supposed to work as a regular fan and an exhaust fan, but it isn't equipped with the proper blade to reverse and exhaust like the honewell fan I previously owned. Still a great regular fan."
5,Excellent book!,"In this volume you can tell that Jeff Doyle is getting better and better at conveying complex concepts in an entertaining and informative way. This book is a main stay in my CCIE preparation regarding the link state protocols. I've advised this book to several people, all of which have been very pleased.I very much enjoy the granular detail of both protocols. Such detail into the functions of each protocol truly allows the engineer to select the right protocol for the job."
2,One track signals better things to come ...................,"I have three of the albums this collection was taken from, plus others issued soon after this, but I never play them. They all contain music with lots of good ideas and themes, but to me they all sound like film soundtracks rather than music for intense listening. They are experiments that don't quite work - a little grandiose, intellectual and messy. I think of them as creative practise for his great more recent work.One track on this collection (The Rug Merchant) is very good, and anticipates my favorite album of his that came 15 years later - ""Ambient Cafe"" (Briza). That album should be in the music collection of every good cafe on Earth. Any cafe that sticks a picture of the album cover on its door can expect me to stop for coffee. Listen to the samples at allmusic.com."
3,"John Carter,,, I mean... David Innes meets a girl..","If you enjoyed A Princess of Mars (1912) and don't mind reading it again, this is the 1914 work is for you.Same style, same story, with a couple of tweaks. Man goes on a journey to another land, falls in love with a pretty girl, offends her by not knowing the customs, some adventure, go to rescue the girl, He being faster, smarter and braver, no major problems."
4,A Helpful Tool For Women Who Struggle With Anger,"Lisa Bevere's newest book, ""Be Angry, But Don't Blow It!"" offers women Biblical insight combined with personal experience and practical steps relating to the issue of anger. In a candid and honest manner, Bevere shares the stronghold anger had on her life and the destructive effect it had on her relationships. In each chapter, she addresses a different facet of anger and its roots, shedding light on Biblical instruction regarding the issue. ""Be Angry, But Don't Blow It!"" is a practical and insightful guide, a must for women dealing with any level of anger, resentment or unforgiveness."
5,It gets to the point,"Lisa is a gifted speaker and loves Jesus Christ. Honest and open about her life, she shares the lessons God taught her. A good study."
5,Excellent Material!,"This book is great and I think every person on the planet could stand to read it. We are going to have the opportunity to be angry, so what do we do with that? Read this book and find out."
5,Beautiful piano music,"I received this album as a gift several years ago and absolutely loved it. I played it in the car all the time because it is such a relaxing album. It was accidentally damaged and I had to throw it away. I recently searched and found it again and I am enjoying it almost every day. If you like instrumentals, add this one to your collection. Perfect."
5,Excellent relaxing music,"My wife and I recently were at a bed & breakfast where this was playing as background music. We enjoyed it so much that we wrote down the artist and album and purchased it as soon as we got home. One reviewer said the music all souded the same. I agree somewhat in that, it is ALL relaxing! I really like that there aren't fast/harder pieces in there - this way I don't get jolted with anything while trying to relax."
5,"The ultimate in Romantic, Mood Setting Music","I own about 12 of David Lanz's CD's now, and it seems as though I can never get enough. I work in a music store and his CD's are the only ones that I ever push on a customer. He is definitely a romantic when it comes to music. This album, ""Beloved"" is my favorite. It takes all of his beautiful romantic pieces and puts it on one cd. So If you don't know much about David Lanz this is a great way to be introduced to his music. You have to have this CD for cold nights around the fireplace."
5,Hopelessly romantic,"Aside from still being in love with the woman who introduced me to David Lanz, I associate the music of Beloved with a deep sense of passion. I would recommend this CD to anyone who truly understands music on a completely different level than most. I mean not that Lanz's work would not be appreciated by the average listener...quite the contrary. However, I feel that Lanz's style and interpretation are more complicated than one would pick up at first blush. Regardless, I love this guy. I doubt anyone would be disappointed."
3,nice looking portable,"I reckon, when it comes to portables, manufacturers like Sony have the following as their priority (listed in order of diminishing priority):#1. Good looking and light; 2. Survive shocks; 3. Long battery life; 4. Sound quality.On the first 3, Sony achieved 100%.However on the last one, it's an embarrassment. The highest non-clipping volume is too low, it'd midrange frequency response is underemphasised. My 6-7 year old Technics portable sounds so much better than this new state-of-the-art player.Don't bother connecting anything but cheap ear-buds to this unit."
3,"Sony, Sony, Sony.","If you're a big guy like me, you'll need to buy new headphones with a longer cord. The cord on the headphones makes it impossible for big folk to hook this thing on their shorts or slacks. The only other alternative is to put the unit in your top pocket, which is impossible because the unit is too big. The volume on this unit, even when at 100%, just isn't enough. My other gripe with this thing is the ""bass"" boost. What a joke! All the bass boost does is cloud the image of the music. This includes jazz, classical, metal and 50's tunes. The bass boost is just hogwash."
2,CD hud was a big problem,"After just only 2 weeks of purchasing this cd player as i was taking the cd out, the cd hud snapped right in half. I even had my finger over the hub because that makes it easier to take the cd out. But it still snapped. And it was at limited use. I only listened to it about 4-5 times in those 2 weeks. And it was also frustrating how easily the cover lid scratched. It played well, ok bass although it didnt get very loud. Aside from some of the good things about this cd player, I believe Sony needs to start making better products that last longer without problems. Basically this cd player is the nike shoes of cd players. I dont recommend buying it."
4,Good for the money.,"Buy it if you plan to use it occasionaly, because the ""extra-long"" battery life is a complete lie. It appears in the picture it is built all durable and everything, but it really is just a piece of aluminum or two. Sound quality is awesome, but the ""hold"" button is too easy to push and that makes me quite mad. I would buy this for around $80. Other than that, the CD Player is great!"
1,Sadly Disappointed,"After telling my wife I was looking for a Walkman type CD player with extra good anti-skip features, she bought this for me for Christmas 2000. The NiCad batteries included never held a charge sufficient to run the player. In mid-January it stopped working and I brought it to a Sony service center. If you receive a Sony product as a gift, get the receipt from the giver. Without it there is no warranty. ""Those warranty cards don't mean anything to us"" I heard this from the service center and the 800 number. Two weeks later I received my player in the mail and it still didn't work. Two weeks after that I received the player in operable condition (both times absent the batteries I foolishly left inside). Today, March 28 2001, it stopped working again. This is one very expensive paper weight and is without a doubt the last piece of Sony junk that will come in our house. Run from this product. Run."
1,Would give it NO stars if I could,"Book is blank. Oh wait, except for first page which instructs you to write down your own funny lesbian stories inside. This is a DIY anthology. I wasn't amused..."
3,A Panning shot that ends with a tracking shot,You first meet Draifa in one of the best shots I have ever seen in film. The camera is positioned in the center courtyard of Draifa's house and begins to pan 360 degrees and then pauses on Draifa in a doorway (she is facing toward the viewer's right). She begins walking and the camera starts tracking with her. It's like a dance. Very nice.As far as the movie goes? It's worth a watch.
3,"Not a core album, but a darned good one!","Monk takes on both Tin Pan Alley and those who say he's a great composer but a lousy player. ""Ask me now"" is heart-tugging; ""Everything happens to me"" is sad and funny both; ""Ruby My Dear"" loses little without bass and drums. The liner notes tell you this is the best Monk album -- it's not, but the off-beat phrasing, the trinkly right-handed trills and the sense of drama (sometimes facetious) makes you believe that Monk can PLAY! He got game!"
5,informative and keeps you reading,"There is much to be written about the Irish in Philadelphia and this book certainly goes into great detail about the emigrants. It tells the conditions of the city, famillies and how they lived, worked, died. I have read it several times and will read it again and again.A family member in Northern Ireland picked up my book and read bits of it while visiting. I was asked to get a copy for them to take back to Ireland as they wanted to know more about the emigrants and their lives after they left the old country."
2,"Just buy the CD ""Revival""","I was sooooo excited when I saw this DVD in stores, but when I brought it home, I was disappointed. The quality isn't that great, the camera angles are boring, and it just didn't do The Reverend justice. The interviews were a mildly interesting, but basically, you should just get the ""Revival"" CD with the DVD in it. It's the same footage."
3,Camera work is amatuerish and dizzying; audio just ok,"The cameraman apparently thought he was being clever by zooming in and out and tilting the camera each way, with rapid fire switches between too close and too far.The result was motion sickness and my wishing that the camera lingered so I could study the Rev or Jimbos handiwork. Instead the camera changes angle every 4 seconds.Big fans will like this as it is all that is out there, but darn it, hire a better crew next time Rev. This was disappointing. I'll keep coming to your shows of course, but this DVD is going onto the shelf."
3,Sound is not very good poor film crew,"I love the good Reverend and was really dissapointed in this video. His shows are much much better. The good right Reverend got ripped off by whoever was doing the video and sound work. Unless they were relatives and did it for free. He should hire the people that did the Blasters ""Going Home"" Dvd. If he has the extra bucks he should get whover does the DVD's for Brian Setzer. Anyway I will still come see you when you come my way, but this DVD is going to Ebay."
2,The Truth Say....,"Just saw the Rev. last week at the Stone Pony. What a great show.This DVD sucks. Like many of the other reviewers, the camera work sucks along with the sound. Pick up the Blasters DVD, you will enjoy.Rev. u owe us a better quality DVD. By the way, the cover of Paranoid was unbelievable.The Truth."
4,GET IT!,"Even though the sound quality could have used some minor tweaking,(hence the lack of the 5th star) this DVD is fantastic! If your even mildly curious about the Heat, this would be a valuable dvd to add to your collection."
5,THE BEST TODAY,"The XY Survival Guide is THE BEST book today. This book has helped me get comfertable with many subjects in homosexual life, and will help anyone, young or old. The book has great information including tips on coming out, dating, sex, and everything you can possibly think of ! It is better than the rest. THE BEST ! If you dont get this book today, you're missing out big time. Help yourself and GET THIS BOOK! -Great job Benjie"
5,THIS SAVED MY LIFE,"What would i have done without this book? Every gay boy out there must get it! It helped me come out to myself, and to my friends! It is something positive, smart, uplifiting, and informative about being gay, written for just for young people. I may not be able to change all the closed-mindedness out there, but this helped me to be able to deal with it better, and to keep on trying. You can be happy! Thank you XY!"
5,**Changing the World One Book at a Time**,"The XY Survival Guide is the first unadulterated, non-judgemental resource manual for young gay men - not only is it well researched and written, but it espouses gay truths like no book before. It shines with the youth, vitality and freshness that has made XY such an ingenious and inspirational publication. There is not high enough praise for Benjie's book - it will truly save lives."
1,Classical Chaos,"This novel was a frustrating journey through classical greek literature with three seemingly unrelated plot lines finally converging into an unbelievable climax that left all three plot lines unresolved. Numerous characters, most one-dimensional, appear from no where and disappear again without explanation or resolution. A frustrating read. The author's Hyperion series, while complex, at least was understandable - this novel is just the literary equivalent of showing off."
3,So disappointing,"I wanted to like this book. I'm a huge fan of Simmons' Hyperion/Endymion books, and the premise for this one sounded right up my alley. Unfortunately, it's a mess. There are three interwoven storylines and at least 2 of them don't make any sense. The characters are never fleshed out, so by the time anything happened to any of them, I found I just didn't care. I understand that the reason for the abrupt ending is that the story is finished in Olympos, but when I got to the end of this one I just had no desire to find out what happened.I'll give it three stars because the Troy storyline is such a pleasure to read. Simmons's way with language shines through in those sections."
2,Hugely disappointing,"I have loved Simmons's other work, but this was a boring and pointless slog, at least to me. Various story lines, none of which were emotionally compelling, dragged together to a non-conclusion so that it can be spun out into a series. Some potentially interesting premises, but disappointingly executed, and I resented reading the entire book to find that it is nothing but the setup to a future series."
5,Where is Olympos on kindle?,"Ilium is a majestic read, and to me represents the best of science fiction. I read both Ilium and the sequel Olympos as soon as they were published in paperback. I plan to buy both of these books on Kindle to add to my permanent e-collection. A year after buying Ilium on Kindle, I am very disappointed that the second book in the series has still not appeared on Kindle! Why do publishers have such difficulty in working out timing?"
2,Read the reviews for Olympos before you buy this,"I really enjoyed this book, but I would not recommend it to anyone. The ending is a cliffhanger, and if you enjoy this book you will feel compelled to read the sequel, Olympos. The sequel is a complete disappointment -- read the reviews and see what people say about it. Although reading Illium was fun (although it dragged in the beginning), the overall experience of the two books was negative. I wish I'd spent my time and money on something else."
3,"Recycled Hyperion, but still Simmons...","Let's see:i) Universe-changing war between humans and non-humans. Check.ii) Dehumanizing means of instant quantum transport. Check.iii) Lots of pretentious literary criticism. Check.iv) Mostly nebbish and clueless male protagonists. Check.For some reason, Simmons annoyed me quite a bit in this book. He has several characters in the book who know a lot about the mysteries of the universe the book is set in but don't reveal the secrets for no reasons except narrative convenience. There were also a lot of obvious plot holes: why is Hockenberry allowed to QT into Olympus by Zeus repeatedly, why did the Jupiter moravecs go to Mars non-stealthily when their apparent master plan depended on their secrecy?Still, it is Simmons, who can do entertaining and clever space opera like no other, and I'm looking forward to the second one. However, the Hyperion books should be your first stop if you are just starting to read him."
1,"so promising, and yet...","The concept of this book was what drew me in, being overly fond of both the Iliad and science fiction. And now, both -- combined! Huzzah! The thing is that I couldn't stand any of the characters. More to the point, I couldn't stand the one and only character, since everyone introduced had the same voice. Imagine, if you will, watching a movie. The 1st character on the screen is one that you do not in any way like. Now imagine that each following character, when they open their mouths, has exactly the same voice -- the same manner of speaking, the same inflections -- as the 1st character, differing in only superficial ways. Not only that, but the voice belongs to a bad actor reading from a bad script. Now, I don't expect brilliance from a mass market pocket book, but I couldn't slog through more than 75 pages of this book with its obnoxiously incomprehensible techno jargon even with a much reduced goal of being mindlessly entertained."
3,almost very good,"Ilium has a fantastic premise. It is a good story and I am a fan of Dan Simmons. However, this book should have been trimmed A LOT. Some authors can conjure subtle feelings of mystery when on the side of the verbose-as in Gene Wolfe- but, Dan does not accomplish this enough. Perhaps, he got lazy. This is the kind of work that could have been truly amazing. Please, Dan, don't settle for mediocre work. The world is already full of it."
5,none,Sensational in wonder and scope. (Simmons) once again shows that he is one of the true visionaries in the annals of SF.
4,Very enjoyable,"I'm not usually a big fan of Sci-Fi, but the juxtaposition of futuristic sci-fi and the Trojan War intrigued me. The book is a bit daunting at first; Simmons plunges right into this world, and it takes a few hundred pages to completely get your bearing.Initially, I was far more interested in the plots involving the Trojan War and the Olympian gods than in the other two plot lines; I was tempted to skip past these other story lines, but sticking to it really paid off once the story lines converged.Although the book is dense with plot, characters and unfamiliar terminology, it's not hard to follow once you get a few chapters in. The story moves and a brisk pace, and Simmons is a vivid storyteller.I am now anxiously awaiting the follow-up novel, ""Olympos."""
2,Neo-conservative Sci-Fi for high school acadamicians,"A short review of a long book:A pointless mishmash of randomly chosen but smart-sounding literary allusions combines with mindless sci-fi elements in Simmons' effort to exort the world to war with terrorists while forcing you to buy another book if you want any resolution of any single plotline whatsoever.The only, ONLY reason to read this book is if it will inspire you to re-read the Iliad. Ilium will seem good enough to keep you turning the pages, but unless you are a card-carrying member of the Cheney fan club, you might be a little turned off by the ultimate message of the book, being: ""In response to the threat against all mankind posed by cockoach-like Islamic terrorists, every member of our society must prepare him or herself to fight while replaying 9/11 in our heads.""Disgusting. Simmons competes with John Travolta for president of the crappy fascist sci-fi club."
1,Too confusing,"This book makes no sense.I was delighted by the summary and the first page - I thought someone who really knew the Illiad had written a modern book. I was kind of disappointed on page 2 when that illusion was shattered. Then things got really confusing.I've got a friend who has studied writing and whenever we discuss books she points out something she learned that people can't read a story with more than 6 active characters without getting confused. This has way more than the maximum number of characters.This is actually three parallel stories, which may or may not be co-temporaneous (who knows? I've read it and I'm still not sure what is going on.) Any one of the three plots would be an interesting story, and the individual plots are very well written, but when you have them in parallel it is absolutely confusing!I'm so confused that I'm not even willing to tackle the sequel that may bring everything together and explain it."
3,Good Story - To Zionist,"Very imaginative and creative book. However, as others have pointed out, Simmons uses a couple of the characters to show the evil of 9/11, but wholly denying the Israeli occupation of Palestine and the subsequent ruthless subjugation of its non Jewish inhabitants as just as evil. It is also ironic that he spends numerous pages depicting the struggle of the ""heroic"" Trojans and Greeks against the omnipotent, technologically advanced ""gods"", but sees noting wrong with the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqi Muslims by a modern day omnipotent, technologically advanced superpower. To bad he felt compelled to taint this great story with contemporary moral relativism."
2,"Not an Easy Read, Often Incoherent","This book lacks coherence and many parts were often unintelligible. Simmons has the bad habit of making up his own words and terminology - this would not be such a problem if he defined them and explained the words when using them. However, he often does not explain the terms until hundreds of pages later, if at all!!(scholic,moravecs, voynix, faxing humans?- i still dont know what these are after reading the novel).He seems to be trying to tell more than one story at a time, and therefore the novel lacks any semblance of a normal progression. I often found myslf mumbling, ""what the heck is going on?"" and would look again and again at the story summary on the dust jacket vainly seeking an explanation.I understand that Simmons is considered a top Sci-fi writer- but he would sell lot more copies if he made an effort not to write in such an obtuse style."
4,brilliant,"The way Simmons blends history and his own tale is a delight to read. As a fan of the Hyperion series, I wasn't sure what to expect. I wasn't disappointed at all, though I only rated Olympos a four because I think Hyperion is better. Ilium's future/alternate world doesn't seem as convincing to me and its characters weren't deeply compelling. The novelization of the Trojan war could stand alone though, and carries the volume."
5,A Masterpiece,"Ilium was one of those books that I found myself thinking about (and even laughing about) certain characters during the day at work. The characters personalities are real and , indeed, some of the characters are loveable (mahnmut the europan moravec)....I just like saying that.The Trojan war kept me enthralled, the power, scheming and brutality of the gods was hard to stop reading, and the other subplots and storylines - very good. A superbly well-woven, cohesive work of fiction that comes together quite nicely at the ending.There were some slight flaws once or twice throughout the book but that doesn't keep this from being, as my title indicates, a masterpiece. Highly recommended."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"No more Trojans, please.I am sure I am all Trojan-analogued out with all the various pieces I have read over the last couple of years, and while I really like Simmons and some of his books and stories are among my all-time favorites, I have picked this one up twice and tried to read it, no joy.(Book is actually 0-4 in this house, as the spousal unit has done the same thing).Just one of those things, I suppose, so on to his next book, as this one is too tedious and uninteresting to be finishable.1.5 out of 5"
2,a little decieved,"thought this was a stand alone book with additional books as seperate stories... wrong. unless you read the entire series, reading only this book is like reading only one book in the LoTR trilogy (which had the decency to describe itself as a trilogy). I hate being lured in by authors who string readers along book after book just to gain additional sales. This book was neither exceptionally well written nor interesting. I won't be reading the others for principle as well as lack of interest"
3,What is going on here? Where is Alex Fox?,Whoever is putting together these compilations together obviously has not had the fortune to listen to the music of ALEX FOX.
5,A Must Have For Flamenco Fans,"This compilation contains some of the best latin guitar artists in the business. Song after song, this CD delivers. A welcome addition to my collection, and maybe to yours too."
5,I really like it.,I see all the negative and positive critics about this compilation and I just want to say that maybe is New Flamenco or maybe is not but this CD makes me feel very happy when I listen to it. And that is enough for me.This is definitely not Elevator or Dentist music.
5,Upbeat Music,"Really enjoy listening to this CD as it's very upbeat and makes me want to ""dance"" in my car while listening to it."
5,great,"At last flamenco that is uncomplicated and not disjointed by tempo changes and slapping and clapping of hands and heels. We wanna hear the guitars, not the shoes."
2,Waste of time,"This unauthorized biography contains nothing that isn't mentioned in Reba My Story and actually has quite a few errors and omissions. The author appears to have gleaned his information from news articles and magazines for the most part although he does seem to have become best mates with Rebas ex husband if his account of the divorce settlement is any indication. He doesn't even have the correct details of the plane that crashed in 91, something that is easily checked by an author with any credibility. The book is padded out with lists of songs from Rebas albums. If you haven't read this yet don't bother."
5,This CD Is A Classic That All Fans Must Have,"When I first listened to this CD it made me think of how much better music was back then. This is a true classic. I was more impressed with the less popular songs on this album. ""Just another lonely night"" and ""Born to love you"" are my personal favorites. I am very suprised those songs didn't make it big. If you are a Temptations fan and you do not have this CD, I would suggest that you purchase this timeless classic."
1,"Very dry fondant, possible very old....","I used to by Wilton Fondant before and worked fine, how ever a this time I think was very old because I can't work with it, very, very dry and I ended using other brand, I feel I through my money out."
1,Disease Mongers -- One-sided with an agenda.,"Another anti-medical establishment book. Once again doctors, drug companies, and anyone anywhere connected with the medical profession are accused of making their patients believe they are sick when they are not. The actual trend is for doctor's to do as little testing and drugging as possible. They fail to mention that it's the patients that come in ""insisting"" they are sick."
4,Chill Factor,"I found Chill Factor to be a bit scattered but still entertaining. I found myself skipping some pages because some parts of the book were more wordy than I would have liked. David and Jo still have that tortured relationship and the abuse to it seems to be getting worse. If you are a Dave and Jo fan, you will not like the ending. I was pleased at the progress Lewis and Kevin had made. My disappointment in Jonathan continues. This is still a great series and I look forward to reading Windfall.other books I enjoy: Kim Harrison- Rachel Morgan series, Jenna Black-Morgan Kingsley series, Larissa Ione- Demonica series, Ilona Andrews- Kate Daniels series, Richelle Mead- Georgina Kinkaid series and Dark Swan Series, Audra and Stella Price- Eververse series, Yasmine Galenorn- Sisters of the Moon series, Vicki Pettersson- Zodiac series; Jackie Keller- Hell on Earth series, T.A. Pratt- Marla Mason series; Mark Henry- Happy Hour of the Damned"
3,Chill Factor,"Joanne is human again, but that's little comfort. She and her Djinn, David, are on the run from the Wardens, the Djinn, and a crazy kid who hates her and has a powerful Djinn of his own. David is her only consolation, until the Wardens take him away, intending to trade him for the more powerful Jonathan. Then, someone with an older grudge kidnaps Joanne, and she finds herself in the middle of a deadly game where she does not know the rules, much less who to trust. Not only her life, but the entire world hangs in the balance.**** The action never lets up in this third entry into an exciting series. Joanne is quirky and brutally honest. The tragedy and humor mix very well in these books, making them seem true to life, albeit filled with fantasy. ****Amanda Killgore"
4,Best in a good series,"The politics, action and suspense continue in high gear in this 3rd installment of a very good series. Joanne (and the world) are having one hell of a bad week but she always manages to find dangerously creative ways to save herself and the planet while staying true to herself. One of the things I like about this character is that, unlike other fictional heroines I admire (Anita Blake, Sookie Stackhouse) or others I can't stand (Betsy Taylor [Undead and Unwed], Rachel Morgan [Dead Witch Walking]) Joanne seems to know herself and her (sexual) needs and doesn't bore us with neverending neurosis about this basic human function or with ambivalence to men in general. Joanne appreciates men, which seems to have gone out of style since forever. Try this series from the beginning--Ill Wind, Heat Stroke, and Chill Factor. Each are better than the previous and good in their own right."
4,Great author,"All my friends and I have read all her books. If you like the first one, buy the entire series. If you like Jim Butcher you'll enjoy these."
4,Warden Book 3,"It was a quick read. Not very deep, but then I did not expect it to be so. I read to relax and escape from every day factors, and that's basically all I want from a book. It kept my interest so I finished it. Many books, the first chapter or two and I am done."
2,"High-school science, anyone?","It's difficult to take a book seriously with statements like this: ""The planet spins this way, right? East to west."" (page 24, Kindle Editiion). Seriously? Was this just a stupid editor, or did the author really say this? Yes, it was a beautiful sunrise in the Western sky this morning. Geez."
5,Can't a girl be cut a break? Another great one.,"The poor girl never seems to cut a break. Can you say nine-lives. Actually, she has been killed previously; so I guess she isn't the luckiest gal alive. Again, Ms.Caine knocks it of the park for me. All I can say is sads for the protagonist and the constant heartache. However, how can anyones life be this dramatic?"
4,Mr. Lincoln is Tragically Timely,"After learning of the federal government's pre-Easter nazi-style raid on the innocent Gonzales family and the machine gun weilding thugs' kidnapping of 6-year old Elian, I played the second cut ""Mr. Lincoln"" several times. The newly developed poignancy of this cut brought tears to my eyes. I shared the song with family members on Easter Sunday who were likewise deeply moved by Hank's imploring Honest Abe's help. It was touching when first released, but as government sponsored storm troopers terrorize America, it assumes a disturbing new power."
3,Quite good for modelers,"In the usual Campaign series format, highlights from the book are the topological maps in 3D and the uniforms and equipment sketches. (These drawings actually come from other Osprey series, such as WARRIORS, MEN AT ARMS, or ELITE.) The historical treatment is not too deep (the book isn't that long!) but gives a nice overview of the whole ""battle of the Bulge"".You could also get ARNHEM 1944 and NORMANDY 1944, from the same series, to complete your collection about that year of WWII."
3,"Beautiful translation, but slightly dated","Taylor's translation of Apuleius' ""On the God of Socrates"" is a beautiful translation, but his prose is slightly dated. It seems most apt for an academic setting, and I recommend it to classicists or those with a knowledge of the classical world."
3,Actually a Pretty Good movie,Excellent Cast okay Cast but rather tired acting . Now this one happy we buy but I will not watch this fim multiple times. You might like this movie but lots if you will not like it.
2,good movie bad streaming,I loved the movie but as far as watching it I kept having to refresh it because it kept getting stuck.
3,Pretty good plot...typical tween movie,"Watched it with my twelve year old daughter, could have done without the sex references. Sort of a spin off of mean girls"
3,"Great movie, but my DVD case was broken.","My DVD case was broken by the time it arrived. The could be the mail mans fault, but the box was not banged up. And, I bought another movie that came with it and it was fine.Great movie though!"
3,Entertaining but not great.,This movie has it amusing moments but it can feel forced at times. It is a very light hearted movie and can be enjoyable if expectations are low.
4,Malibu Barbie meets Prep School,"This movie is pretty much a redo ofSt. Trinian's. Nonetheless, it's a pretty decent one at that though. It has some funny moments and, while it is largely predictable, there are some twists that come as a surprise. Probably god for teen girls."
5,Loves it! emma roborts love her!,Emma roborts is so good in this movie . I love her Character in it ! I love poppy ! cute name 2! FYI this movie was the best! I dont know why people are so picky these days! wouldnt` you would watch twilight but not wild child??? lol ps Im like so in love with twilight 2 lol not more then wild child though I like a gossip girl style movies to it! those are movies I love!
2,Meh...,"1.5 stars. I read the reviews and still rented it. Even with low expectations it was still a big letdown. Not worth it as a chick flick. In the end the character played by Emma doesn't really change, she just makes those around her worse. Waste of time. Save your money. The only highlight was definitely Alex Pettyfer, very good looking. :)"
1,"Terrible acting, terrible plot","Rented this on a whim; was so terrible I didn't even watch it the whole way through. Terrible acting, shallow plot. Would not recommend for fans of the cheesey teen drama chickflick genre."
1,You do not get what you pay for.,This item is not a 3/4 horse power as stated. You receive a 1/2 horse power with the 23-880 item number.
4,Good collection,I can remember when players ball was running on mtv. but until this dvd i did never know that p.diddy directed it. it's good stuff for one hour but no videos from the aquemini record. that's why only 4 stars
3,quesionable content,"We recently purchased the DVD along with the CD. The CD carries a parental advisory, and the songs are there in full uncut form. Despite the fact that there is nothing on the DVD mentioning that it had been modified, words are edited out of the songs. They play on the DVD as they do on televised music videos. When I purchase a DVD I expect the videos to be uncut, or to at least have some notation if they have been edited for language. The DVD may be worth the purchase as it is, but I feel artista should be honest with consumers about what they're getting."
3,Don't Like Censorship,"Disappointed that the disc is edited. Not just the lyrics, but some of the visuals on B.O.B. as well."
2,It's No Good!!!!,"Don't waste your money on the dvd. When I saw this, I thought all the videos were going to be on it. BUT IT'S NOT!!! They got two versions of Hey Ya, The Way You Move, ATLiens, SPCM, B.O.B., and only a few others. No signs of Rosa Parks, Art of Storytellin', Benz or Beamer....none of that. Save your money and don't buy it. Maybe next time, they cram ALL they're videos on it."
3,"No Doubt, It's Tight But.....","Hey Dog,For real this is a good collection of Outkast's best but still mad 'bout a couple vid's not shown. Come on guys, WHERE IS ""THE ART OF STORY TELLIN'"" FEAT. SLICK RICK!!! <(that's a classic) It's already bammer enough that it's STILL edited."
2,"Made for Kids, not Fans.",Great video package but I feel very forgotten and let down by Outkast for allowing the lyrics to be removed for the very young fans. If there were a choice in explicit content then I would feel Better and not Bitter.
3,disappointing,"This dvd is not as good as I thought it would be.When I ordered this dvd, I was expecting to get every single video OutKast ever appeared in, even if it was just a small cameo. I'll tell you what videos you'll get.You'll get ""southerplayaliticadillacmusik"",""platers ball"", ""A.T.Liens"", ""elevators"", ""B.O.B"", ""Ms.Jackson"",""So fresh,So clean"", ""The whole world"", ""Hey ya"", and""the way you move"". There is also a long version of""Hey ya & the way you move"", but all that is is just the 2 videos back-to-back with 2 minutes of extra footage in between.There is no sign of ""Rosa parks"", or even the dungeon family video. You will be better off taping the videos off t.v."
4,Great little Tenderizer,This thing should be called the Little Poker.It's one hell of a tenderizer.I would have rated it higher than a 4 and given it a 5 but it's already started to rust. That's entirely my fault for not cleaning and drying it. I assumed that I could just rinse and clean it and leave it to air dry. Do not do that. I would spray alittle vegetable oil or harmless mineral oil on it to keep it from Rusting.It works very well and for the money it's a steal.
4,Great But Not Perfect,"I've tenderized steaks many different ways--poking holes with a fork, pounding them with a meat tenderizing hammer, marinating in special sauces & spices, etc., but this is, in my experience, the best way to turn an inexpensive cut into a juicy tenderized steak. However, buying a cheap product has it's pros & cons:Pros:-Inexpensive-Very simple to use (just press down on meat)-Easy to grip-Easy to clean (Run hot water, soak in soapy water then rinse, or dishwasher)-Saves time (24 holes per poke)Cons:-Gets stuck on thicker pieces of meat that will make this job A LOT HARDER!-""Sharp"" stainless steel prongs are sometimes not sharp enough-More expensive models have almost 50 razor sharp bladesFor the price, you're getting an excellent product, but it's definitely not the best one out there."
2,Pro grip ez,Buy the model with the greater number of spikes. This works but is very hard to use. The spikes are to big around and hang in the meat
2,Nor Pro Grip,"The tenderizer is very simplistic, yet very efficient. However, one of the two I ordered was defective: pins were pulling out. This does not say much for their quality control!"
5,Nice,Works well and is easy to use. It makes the meat much more tender and does what it claims. I would recommend this to a friend
2,Great start....but it runs out of gas fast.,"Cannell should be ashamed of himself. After 300+ pages of a terrific (and often terrifying) cyber- duel between two antisocial computer geniuses, his payoff scene is just another lowest-common- denominator knife fight in a dark room....which the heroes find virtually (no pun intented) by accident. Real television stuff, from a master of that medium. A huge letdown."
2,"Strong opener, silly ending","The conspicuous giant was supposed to be supersmart and a computerwiz. He turned out to be a bumbling slob who was mediocre with computech. Don't expect this to be a computer crime book, the use of the computer ended midway in the book. The ending was not plausible nor believable."
2,Since when does U.S. Customs go after serial killers?,"The creator of the A-Team takes on Silence of the Lambs and The Net! Computers, heavy metal and lots of gore. Not a bad read but....the plot has holes big enough to drive a truck through. Why would a serial killer profiler be working for U.S. Customs? Why would one of their rogue agents join her in flushing out a cyber killer virtually single handedly (with the help of a hacker/cracker they spring from prison). I don't think we'll see Hackman (no pun meant!) or Eastwood in this one. Strictly straight to video"
1,Really bad karma.,You would think that someone like Cannell would know better than to write something like this. But apparently even he slips once in a while. If you haven't read one of his other books yet do that and leave this one alone. Otherwise go read someone else.
3,Bland,"The final victim may be the reader. Ok I am sure it is difficult to come up with a new exciting story all the time so I do not get too disappointed when an author goes to the holy grail of thriller writing - the bad cop, good side kick murder mystery caper. But this book pulled out so many of the good old stand by's that I thought it was written just to add them in. Sure the story is good - we all know it, and the action keeps you reading that particular section of he book, but the author tried to make these dull, well used characters have some depth and he just could not pull it off. I do give him credit for trying to make these central casting characters a little more meaty, but unfortunately all it did was slow down the book. If you are looking for something new, this is probably not the one to stop on, if you are looking for a standard fair action mystery then this will fit the bill."
1,Hollywood flack victimizes net freedom,"Cannell proves himself master of the exploitative hack job, and I don't mean hackers. He totally ignores the value and positive use of anonymous remailers in his rush to pander to the prevailing ignorance.For a far better, informed, thoughtful suspense, read Backslash by Wm. H. Lovejoy.Cannell only tries to feed the prejudice of the keepers of the nanny state. It may win him points in Washintgon, but the novel sucks."
1,batteries died with seldom use,"I bought it at the end of Jan. I put it in my baby's swing to replace the one which was used more than 6 months. After 40 days, the new batteries were died! In these days, I seldom put my baby in the swing! it not worth to buy!"
1,False advertisement,"Advertisement shows packages with "" 5 year guarantee fresh"" but batteries received were individually packaged with an expiration date of 2 months from purchase. No more battery purchases from Amazon for me!"
4,Great price,"Batteries are batteries... we needed replacements for the smoke alarms and for our guitar that has a built in tuner. These were a great price and duracell always seems to last for a good while, especially in these cases where the usage doesn't drain much power"
2,Don't like packaging,"I thought this was a great price for 20 AA batteries, even when you include shipping which was about the same amount as the batteries themselves. The problem is, they came loose, in a cardboard box. The photo shows them in a nice SEALED Duracell package. Mine showed up in a small box, NOT SEALED in any way. Loose batteries may have come in contact with metal which could have cause partial discharge. There is also no way to know whether these batteries are partially used. That seems unlikely, but I won't know for sure until I've tried them over a number of months. Each battery shows a date of March 2019, approximately 7 years, which is the typical shelf life of SEALED batteries. I'm not ready to say whether these batteries will perform as intended. I'll have to wait until I use them.In any case, if the product is shown on the web site as SEALED in a Duracell package, that's what the customer should get. I'm not happy about that."
1,Scam,"Received my package today with 20 Duracell batteries, just like I ordered. I only wish I had specified that I wanted batteries that were in in their original packaging and not ALREADY PAST THE EXPIRATION DATE. Silly me."
4,Duracell Coppertop 9-V Alkaline 4 Count,"On sale the price is better than the supermarket. Make sure it's a sale price though, they can get a little pricey otherwise."
1,Old batteries,Beware! These batteries do not come in a package. They are shipped loose inside a box and none of the 20 worked. I spent over $11.00 for the product and S & H and now have to go through aggravation of returning old batteries and possibly paying more to return dead batteries. URGH..never again.
3,Buyer be aware,Batteries arrived in a timely manner. Haven't used them yet but appear to be fine. Brooklyn Battery Works page states that the batteries are guaranteed for 5 years but batteries have an expiration date of 2.5 years. They did offer to take them back but not sure if that is the point.
3,batteries,i thought that i was getting a rather good price on the Batteries and a few days after ordering them found them cheaper locally.
5,Great Value,"Absolutely worth the buy. 20 batteries at this price is insanely good. Forget Walmart and Dollar General, Amazon is my new source for batteries. Thank You Amazon!!!"
1,Don't last,"I teach aerobics classes and purchased these batteries for the transmitter of my wireless microphone system. Typically batteries will last 5-6 classes but these batteries only last 1 to 1-1/2 classes. They are a bargain but because I have to use many more batteries in a week than before, they are actually more expensive in the long run. The expiration date isn't until 2018 so don't know why they are such duds but I doubt I'll purchase them again. Duracells should be good batteries so I'm disappointed."
5,"Duracell Coppertop Batteries D, 8-count","The Duracell Coppertop Batteries are always a great buy. I buy ahead so as not to be out at any time. These D-cell batteries are long lasting, and I have never received any that were not in perfect working order.One can always be assured that items bought from Amazon are top quality."
1,Received drained batteries in open packing,DO NOT BUY. THESE ARE DRAINED OUT BATTERIES. THEY ARE NOT IN THE PACKING SHOWN. THEY ARE IN OPEN PACKING. THESE ARE DUDS!!!!
2,"fine, but watch the expiration date!","These are fine batteries, and they work.However, they all have an expiration date of beginning of 2015. Not a big deal, but it's late 2012 now, and the package 'guarantees at least 5 years'. Clearly not the case, and they have clearly been sitting around the warehouse a while. Dusty package and all. Now again, they work fine, and the 'early' expiration date is not a problem for me, but I would certainly think twice about accepting these if I was to store for future purposes. These came from Amazon, not a 3rd party vendor."
1,Dead Batteries,As a disabled person I rely on ordering things online since it's very difficult for me to get out and I dont drive. I ordered these batteries and it took them 16 days to get here and when they arrived all of them were dead.
3,They came within 2 days,They didnt come in the packet shown above and they are easy to store in the TINY box they ship them in
5,batteries,"Copper top batteries have never let me down. All others will die within a year, but I'll only use coppertops from now on. Even when giving gifts, flashlights, toys, clocks, etc. I will not use cheap batteries."
5,Great product,I have always used Duracell batteries and the price I paid for this product was a great! I recommend to anyone
3,Oooops!,It is hard for me to know how to rate this...since I did not mean to order C batteries at all. Am looking for someone who needs them. Sigh!
5,DuracellAA's,"I bought the 20 pack, because we have so many gadgets laying around the house that require AA's that I am forever needing one...great batteries!! Thanks Duracell!!"
5,Fresh,"Expiration is 2018, I'm happy. I can't think of too many more words to say so I'll just say, ""yadda yadda yadda""."
5,Good life.,For the price the product is good. I got it under subscribe and save program. Used it for my son's Fisher price swing and it lasted for about 3 weeks ...that is enough .
1,Expiration Date,"Be sure to check the expiration date on your batteries when they arrive. I got some supposed to have a 5 year expire date and they only had 3. AMAZON tried to make it ""right"" and send me some with 4 year expiration dates while allowing me to keep the ones with 3 year expire dates::::-CAVEAT EMPTOR"
2,No original packaging,Arrived as a set of 20 loose batteries placed in a white box the size of a shipment of business cards. The date printed on them were 3 months before the date I ordered them and I found that many of them powered my optical mouse either (1) barely at all or (2) for a very short time -- a fraction of the time my store-bought Duracell batteries lasted.
3,not the way it was shown,It was in an unsealed box. I haven't tried them yet so all i can describe is how the product looks when it got to me. The product doesn't come like the way the picture shows. The shipping was fast.
1,"Batteries do not come in a sealed Duracel package; the look as if they could be used, not new","These Duracel batteries come in a Brooklyn Batteries box that is not sealed; the do not come in a sealed Duracell box as pictured. It is impossible to tell if these are new, fully charged batteries unless you have a battery meter."
1,another leaking duracell,"Just had to clean the acid out of another clock. These batteries can leak before they lose their charge. They should only be used where they will be used up and replaced right a way. Never use them in a flashlight or a wall clock or any device where the battery is only used every once in a while or to hold the memory until the power comes back on. Over the years I have lost or had corroded many items , but I loved that copper top. I hope that I have finally learned my lesson, the hard way, again. No more copper top."
2,Older batteries came out in a plastic case.,"Item did not arrive on a cardboard card, it arrived in an easy to open plastic case and with the expiration date only 3 years out. Fresh batteries have a 5 year expiration date. The description and the picture of this item needs to be changed if they are going to sell Amazon customers a different and older item. They were nice and sent me a return label free of charge."
4,Batteries,What can I say they are batteries and Duracell so I believe just about all of know how well they function. They are a fairly good battery but as we all know will eventually die.
1,Old batteries,"did not last very long, several batteries were already did when I attempted to use them. Disappointed with this purchase."
1,"Duracell Coppertop 9V batteries, expired, not in advertised packaging","The fact that these batteries may come in varying packaging (in my case a 4-wide clear plastic case with absolutley no Duracell labeling) is not at all obvious from the description on the product page. This alone seems deceptive to me. On top of that, the batteries I ordered (a 4-pack of 9V) had expired 7 months prior to their arrival.The packaging plus the age of the batteries makes this all seem very sketchy. I strongly recommend NOT purchasing this item. The seller name for my order is ""uTrusted"" and based on this purchase I suggest you avoid them."
5,great bargain,"great bargain, love the large package. can never have enough batteries. coppertop has been our brand for batteries for years"
2,Buy only for immediate use due to very short shelf life.,These batteries were old with only 2 years left on their 5 year shelf life warranty. The seller should have clearly stated the limited shelf life of these products since most of the purchasers would expect normal longevity. Buy only if you plan to use immediately in a relatively short term application. Checking the other reviews of this product and supplier they seem to have more than their share of problems. I have cancelled my subscription order for this product.
5,Working fine,"Long lasting and strong, using them in my lantern. Coppertops are the best in my opinion! Long lasting and strong"
5,"Best Batteries, love the frustration free packaging",Best batteries brand by far--reliably long lasting. Love purchasing these on Amazon due to the frustration free packaging and subscription service. Perfect for families with kids where electronics and toys blow through batteries so quickly.
5,Duracell Coppertop Batteries,Although I have not used any of the batteries yet I expect them to be as good or better than any other battery i have used. If not I will revisit my review.
5,The way to buy AAs,"I was a little leary when I read some of the reviews. Mine came quickly, factory packaged in 2 individually wrapped trays of 17. The date on them is Dec 2022. These are what you get in retail stores only at a much better price and delivered to your door. What more is there to ask for?"
3,Did not work as expected,"I normally like Duracell - their products tend to last a decent amount of time and they're pretty affordable.However, I can't support this product at all. I tried my best to make due with these Coppertops, but they just didn't cut the mustard.For one thing, they're not designed with common sense in mind. I tried to understand the markings on them, but they just wouldn't hook up to my car very well. Once I finagled a makeshift rigging to attach them (two rubber bands and an empty can of PAM Cooking Spray), I turned the key with success on my mind.To my chagrin, the car wouldn't start at all. In fact, it started to smoke, I heard a series of loud pops, and then my engine exploded into a ball of fire. It took the fire department two hours to put out the ensuing blaze.Regardless, I tried a handful of these in my TV remote and they worked great. It seems they're more effective in smaller products, so next I'm trying them in the toaster.I guess you get what you pay for!"
5,Batteries,"These came as pictured - a big pack of D cell batteries. They worked out of the box - fit the Nerf guns properly. They seem to be fully charged. I don't recommend throwing them around, as they're big and could hurt somebody. And break stuff like windows and TVs. My kids cry when they get hit by them. But its ok, cuz they're 5 and 9 and they'll get over it."
2,Sheisty looking batteries.,"As a few other reviewers have noted, these batteries arrived in post production packaging. Either they could be from a larger container, or they could be used. I'll try to remember to update this with the results after trying some of them out."
3,Older Batteries hence the lower price,"I purchased two packs of 9 volt batteries for my home smoke detectors. Unfortunately the batteries have a 03/2012 date stamped on the end of them and I received them in 07/2012. Quite old. Hopefully they'll last for a little while. I guess this is one of those cases of, ""You get what you pay for""."
1,Don't buy batteries,"Purchased batteries one month ago. Went to use them today, 6-23-12, lasted 10 minutes then dead. Looked up return policy which ended 6-22-12. Wouldn't have thought I would have had to test Duracell batteries. Will never buy batteries again from Amazon. Better off looking for them on sale in store ads."
5,Great value and AMAZING shipping if your a PRIME member!!,Ordered this and got this in pretty much the next day since i became a Prime member! I LOVE Amazon!!! Summing it all up if i cannot find it on Amazon i think twice if i really want or need something...Great price for item and obviously the batteries are great like any Duracell product!!:)
4,Battery Options,"Battery options I've used:1) BJ's or other warehouse stors - I believe they have 40 per pack for $10?2) Free batteries - Lowes or Home Depot, battery packs 16-20 for $9.97 but come with $10 off $50 coupon, so they are essentially free if you're going to spend $50 later and HD or Lowes anyway.3) Buy batteries at Christmas time at Lowes, HD, other stores... big packs for small price and especially after christmas when they want to clear them out and even cheaper. I find ray-o-vacs are fine too vs Duracell/Energizer."
3,duracell batteries,"Bought these duracell batteries received them on time. But they just didnt last like regular duracell batteries, they have about half the battery life. Almost like there defective."
5,POWER!,The Duracell batteries provide all the power and constant dependable service my family need.Pricing is reasonable and the quality is great!
5,satisfied,"product lived up to expectations, service was excellent. Amazon has proven to be a leader in its ever expanding service market.."
4,Good batteries,I ordered these to go along with a lantern I ordered for a gift. I just wanted to make sure they had everything to needed to use the lantern. Duracell makes good batteries and I would have picked this brand up in a store if I was buying them for myself.
4,Dependable Copper Power,"These are my 'go to' batteries. They are consistently good. Consistency is important. The Copper Top folks make a solid, dependable product, and I think that's commendable."
5,Great item,"It's nice to have a supply around the house all nice and organized in a central location. When they were a lightning deal, it was even better!"
1,Batteries arrived unpackaged,The 4 batteries arrived in 4 small ziplocs rather than in sealed Duracell packaging as shown in the picture. I have no idea if they are new or used.
1,"Purchased on Amazon. Dripping of battery acid. Duracell copper top -D, 8 count","These batteries were purchased on Amazon along with a new Coleman LED lantern, as a gift for my mom. They were put into the lantern, they did work, but the next morning there was battery acid all around the base and in the lantern. I do not know what would be the cause of this, nor the expiration on the batteries, they were sent to my mom in a different state than where I live."
1,Check expiration date,"Batteries were purchased in June 2012, but product received had expiration date of Feb 2012. Also they did not arrive in the advertised packaging, so am not sure if they are genuine. Could be good deal but make sure you check the dates when you receive the product."
1,Misleading Ad for Duracell Batteries,"The items are not as represented by seller. These batteries are not in the original Duracell packaging. They come loose in a plastic bag. There is no way to tell if they are real, fake or have been used. Do not buy this product from this seller. Very misleading ad."
1,DEAD!,I went through five sets of these in ONE DAY taking pictures. I didn't even take that many. These were so bad!!!
4,They are batteries. They power stuff.,"Not much to say, they are Duracell batteries and they provide 1.5V of power in a convenient AAA form factor. These do have the benefit of being in easier to open packaging than the plastic enclosed ones from a brick and mortar store."
5,They work.,They are 9 Volt batteries and they work! You can use them to shock little children or something more productive like keeping your family a little safer from smoke/fire/carbon monoxide.....your choice.
5,My life is brighter now,"It seemed that all the battery-run objects we have would run out at about the same time, and we would have to scramble to look for new ones. My husband is especially happy because his TV remote is now always working smoothly. As for me, I like to make sure our flashlights are in good working order. The package is well constructed, easy to open and reclose, and has enough batteries in it to keep us happy for a long time. It is also easy to store to keep handy."
2,"QC going down, getting leakers",For years and years I never had a leaker from Duracell. (when I was a kid every battery brand leaked) But I must say that in the past year I have had 4 aa's that have leaked. It is not about the price of the battery it is about the vintage equipment that I put them in. I know they can make them so they dont leak. As the have been doing this. But now they have let their QC slide. This is really sucks as this is becoming the norm to put out sub standard product because of price.
1,"Batteries fine, price increased before check-out","These arrived in a Duracell package and seem fine. I trust Duracell, which is why I purchased them. My complaint is they were marked as $11.50 for 8 C batteries and when I checked out a couple hours later, they were almost $12. I checked them the day after I purchased and yep, they're $11.50 again. Yes, it's just 50 cents, but it's over 4% mark-up and I notice prices do change after I add them to my cart, but not until at least a day's passed! Buyers beware!"
5,good,Batteries were exactly how the picture was. Very pleased with the quality of the product and promptness of my order
5,Review of Duracell Coppertop Duralock AAA Batteries 14 Count,What can I say. They are batteries and they shipped fast which is a plus. I just bought these to spend remaining amount on an Amazon Gift Card. The batteries came in handy for toys and other gifts on Christmas of 2012.
3,Avoid,"Avoid this seller, batteries were loose in a box rattling around and had no invoice, and I was missing a few batteries out of my order."
3,Product received not as pictured,"If you're expecting a to receive 20 batteries in Duracell packaging, you'll be disappointed. What I got was essentially a plastic box with the batteries in it...or rather, spilled out of it. None of the batteries I got were damaged and the expiration date on them is for 2018, 5 years later, not the 10 years as labeled in the picture."
1,Dead batteries,Out of the 34 only 8 had a chargePkg looked goodOnly good for paperweights if needed in a pinch but if you buy them for use forget it go to Walmart or SAMs buy the cheapest they will last much longer than these do
3,Not sure if they last very long,So I'm giving the batteries a three star mainly because it doesn't seem like their life is very long....my mac mouse goes through them extremely;y fast...but the price is good if the short life is the norm.
5,Prepared!,"I love to shop online, especially during the holidays. This is a quality product - no surprises from Duracell. Fast shipping. Now we're ready for those new toys."
1,leaks acid and ruins electronics,I almost always bought Duracell Copper Top batteries till this year. I've had four clocks ruined and my expensive laser level ruined by Duracell AA and AAA batteries. All had expiration dates of either 2013 or 2014. I've swapped out all Duracell batteries due to the amount of damage I've experienced just this year.
2,I would just say BUY RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES!,"Why pay $9 for a bulk pack of throw-away batteries when you can just buy a 4-pack of rechargeables for a few bucks more? A one-time payment of batteries you can charge 1000 times will break even on the long run if you project prolonged use of devices taking AAs. Also, every charge cycle of rechargeables lasts longer than the total mAh of throw-aways."
3,confirm product origin and packaging with seller before buying,"Although Duracell has been the best out there when it comes to buying them from Amazon.com I urge you to contact seller before and asking them if these are made in USA and in original packaging, because I bought them and they shipped repacked in a small white box, not as on the item picture, and in addition they has Chinese lettering and was made in china.... so if you consider purchasing these, contact seller and make sure that they sell you Made In USA and in ORIGINAL manufacturers packaging..."
2,Batteries,It was odd but these batteries were delivered in an open package which seems to indicate that they are not new. I am going to test each battery to see the charge before give these a better rating. I feel that these should be described as loose batteries so that we can make a choice as to purchase or not.
4,Using,I purchased this for my security motion sensor light. It works well now and let me keep seeing how long it can stand.
2,Not as showed,"These AA Batteries was just like the AAA. they were not as showed, They also were not in a Duracell pk. they was in a unmarked box. and some of them looked to be used."
3,Okay,"These came in a plain plastic package, not the one shown here. They seem to be genuine Duracell coppertop batteries."
1,Horrible purchase,"Bought these for smoke detectors in a rental property of mine, but there's no way I'm putting them in. Batteries came in generic packaging, not manufacturer's. Each of the 4 batteries expired in May of 2012, and 9V are good for 5 years afte they are manufactured, meaning these were made in 2007! Finally, these batteries could easily be knock offs, as there are Asian characters (Chinese?) on the bottom. These are being returned ASAP. Avoid at all costs, not worth the risk of malfunction."
1,short life-span,"I put these in my son's Graco swing, and they lasted less than a week. I was seriously not impressed."
2,Westclock BatteryRun clock,I thought the time would light up and it doesn't so the clock is really of no use to me.Thank you'
3,Hot when received,Batteries came loose in a plastic bag. Batteries were very hot like they had been touching terminals. Don't know how good they are now.
5,Wait for the specials,"If you wait for the specials they run ALL THE TIME, these are a fantastic deal. Amazon is where I get all my batteries now. I buy a pack or two, keep them in a drawer, and wait for the next special to reorder. The durability is fine, not alkaline length, but last in what I use them for (computer mice, remote, flashlights, etc)."
4,Exactly what I ordered,Exactly what I ordered. nothing like a Duracell. My kids toys will work well into the new year!
3,Duracell,It's a battery. Duracell does have long lasting batteries but I would not go nut's for a review on them
2,They died fast,We only used them for a week on a air pump and they died. I don't know how long they should last but a week was not long enough.
1,These cell didnt work,Most of the cell i got is already discharged or defected..Not sure but why but they are not working with my baby's swing..I tried another one which i purchase from store that are wroking.
5,"Great value, and the convenience of a subscription!","I ordered the AA batteries, which arrived in an easy-to-open and well-protected package. I looked at the manufacture date and these were manufactured 12/10/10, which was a little under 2 months ago, and the expiration is March 2017. I feel satisfied that I have a ""fresh"" product. We got a Wii for Xmas and use it a lot to watch movies on Netflix and play games, so we end up changing batteries probably once every 2 weeks. We burned through an 8 pack since Xmas, so I thought we better find something both convenient and economical. I think this is a good price and I like that all I have to do to get more is keep an eye on when my next shipment is scheduled; either leave it for the date set, or ask to have one shipped earlier or postpone it. I like that I can get many of the things (like batteries) that are repeat purchases in the mail. I really like subscribe and save, so I hope Amazon continues to add more items."
3,Not in original packaging,I can't really review the quality of these batteries yet as I have only used one but I did find it very strange that they didn't come in their original packaging. They were shipped in a relatively loose plastic clam shell container.
3,A gift,This item was sent as a gift. The recipient was pleased with the CD.I was not pleased when the recipient told me that the packing slip included the price for the gift.I hope you change this policy.
1,bad bad and more bad,"I've heard the album, and I give it 10 thumbs DOWN. She used to look real, but now, I guess that she's had 100 plastic surgeries, because she looks plastic.I read in a magazine that she hates shopping w/her kids, it's like the worst thing ever to her. What kind of a mother would say that. Now about the album, I would never buy it. If your a Faith Hill fan, then you might like it, but if you're not a fan, don't waste your hard earned money."
5,All the best on 1 CD! Excellent!!!,"Fans of Faith Hill rejoice! A very nice compilation with all her pop hits and some alternate versions. ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" was a real treat. The only disappointment was ""Let Me Let Go"" is a solo version, not the one with Vince Gill singing backup. The only other thing I could have wished for that was NOT included is ""The Star Spangled Banner"" from the Superbowl. Generally, such patriotic cameos are not included on compilations so that is probably wishful thinking. Great CD. Buy it now. LET THEM HAVE FAITH!"
4,Fab CD,I bought this CD mainly because I loved the song 'There You'll Be' and vaguely knew a few other songs such as Breathe (NB Am from Ireland where There You'll Be is the song most people know Faith for). I love this CD! In fact I am now a Faith Hill fan and have bought other albums by her since getting this one. This album is more pop than country which suits me just fine (in fact I kind of prefer that) but die hard country fans may not be too impressed.
3,Sounds Good but It is miss something!,This cd sounds good but it is missing some of her best songs! 'It Matters To Me' is my fav and it is not to be found on Faith Hill's Best of! She has some good ones with Tim McGraw also not on this cd! So I would wait!!!!!!!!
1,False advertisement,These are not Aimco rotor is an off brand. This is false advertisement.Shipping and returns were fast.
1,Worthless,"This has to be the worst book I've ever read. Well, not quite true, but definately the worst book on a topic that really interests me. The author is rather good with words, but the content is very weak and I really can't use any of the recommendations, but 2-3 of them. It's an inexpensive book, but even at the current asking price, it's too much. I'm sorry that I have to say this, vecause the idea is great."
5,On the Scene is a trip into the fictional world of emergency medicine,"First of all, yes, this is my own work. Yes, I wrote the book, left it on a shelf for months and then picked it up to read, and I found out something. I like the book! You've had that feeling when you wrote that essay in high school or college! Yeah, this is good stuff!Now, as far as the storyline is concerned, if you want to ride along in an ambulance and get a real feel for what a paramedic feels when they are trying to save a life, this book will take you there.This is my first published novel and I have One the Scene II and One the Scene III ready to go once a few more readers have discovered this intial offering!"
1,Complete waste of money,"Bought this based on photos and description, expecting it to be magical in my toddler's room. Realized that it doesn't revolve, its tiny and and the paper lamp covers are extremely flimsy. Definitely not worth the money it cost to buy it."
4,Alessandra in Between,"I'm 16 years and attend summit high school. Mr. Kaplow is my 10th grade English teacher and I've recently read the book ""Alessandra in Between"". Which he wrote. I liked it and though it was a good love story of teenagers. Being a teenager I could relate to the story. I thought that it was funny and entertaining. I don't know what is my favorite part was but I liked the whole love triangle thing going on in the story. It's a good book to read if your in high school or older."
5,Wonderful book,"4.5*The story is a familiar one: a struggling single mom helped by a soul-damaged man with a shady past, and a wealthy man determined to get the woman's farmland for himself. What is unique is the way Guhrke makes this story worth reading one more time. The author does a particularly good job with the children, giving them believable personalities and actions.For readers who enjoyed The Outsider by Penelope Williamson and/or Morning Glory by LaVryle Spencer, Conor's Way is sure to be another favorite."
3,slow paced for me,This is either tame historical romance or ac hristian romance with 2 mildly racy scenes. A bit too God centered for my tastes. I did finish it a few chapters at a time but it was slow paced and not a page Turner for me.
3,Could be better finish,"This is a great piece of sandpaper for medium sanding, but for finish sanding (especially drywall) they leave scratch marks that are highly visible after painting."
3,work fine and price was OK,"The sanding screen pretty much does what you'd expect. I've had no problems with it. The price was pretty decent, in line with the brick and mortar home improvement stores. I agree with other reviewer that using this with vac system sure beats the heck out of straight up sanding."
5,Great Betty Neels book,"It is always a pleasure to read a Betty Neels book, and this one was no disappointment. A very enjoyable read"
4,But only if you are a Betty Neels fan...,"And since I am...I enjoyed it. If you are looking for literary merit, there is some, but not much. It's the comfort food of romance."
5,wonderful,"Does a great job of cleaning fine delicate areas such as a guitar fret board while removing finger oil, dirt and fret build up problems."
2,Bad value (imo),"Unless this stuff is somehow magic compared to regular steel wool, this is a terrible value. I have no idea what the 18 (cs) is, but I assumed it meant I'd at least be getting 18 pieces of steel wool. Instead I received 6 2x4 pieces. Steel wool is SOOO much cheaper than this at the store."
4,We love this one!,"But some of us wish we could delete Vanna. On this game, she's just a bit gushy. Very good for working on reading, typing and problem solving skills. You can either use the keyboard, touch screen or click to choose a letter. We have used an older version of it with an alternative keyboard. This does work for many adults with disabilities to learn and reinforce skills and to have fun!"
1,old version,Operation is inconsistent and erratic. I think it out of date with newer operating systems. The old version works much better.
4,Cute but not functional,These are well made but a little too small to use for cooking so I am using them on the table with meals.My husband finds the finger holes too small to use.
5,Wonderful inspiring miniature landscapes!!!,I love this book! It is so inspiring. Gilda uses supplies that most crafters/quilters have in their sewing rooms to make spectacular landscapes. Don't be afraid to try out her techniques. They are easy to follow and you'll be amazed at what you can create with some simple embroidery stitches.
4,COMBINATION FLOWER CREATION,"VERY INTERESTING USE OF MACHINE EMBROIDERY, HAND CUTTING, HAND SEWING & PAINTING. CREATES GREAT DEPTH & TEXTURE..IMPRESSIVE & FUN TO OWN."
1,shallow waters,"Alcorn deals with first rate issues in a third rate manner. His presentation of systems is particularly lacking in depth. Bibliographic references are not directly tied to text. General chapter references are given at the end of the book, but these are often dated and thin."
3,Just Fell Short,While this is a fun game overall they managed to fall short of what most civ fans expect. The interface is not the best. The game is much too easy to master. Definately an improvement over Call to Power 1 but if your a devoted fan of this genre I would recommend getting Civilization III and staying away from the Call to Power series.
2,I have to admit... I was dissapointed...,"After hearing so much about CTP 2, about the ""great"" campaigns it would include, and everything, I have to tell you, I am dissapointed in it. I had read in some site that CTP 2 would in include a World War campaign (don't remember if it was WWI or WWII) but anyways this was what I had been looking forwards to the most... Sadly there was no such campaign.... It is also still TOO similar to CTP 1, i mean I expected new units, a whole new things... If it was going to be like this, they should have just made an expansion for the first game and sold it cheaper. If you've never played CTP, I highly recommend it, but if you already own CTP, either wait until the price goes down or dont get it because its current price is NOT worth it since it's almost like playing CTP with only SLIGHT changes"
3,Good enough - but not as fun as Civilization II,"I have a real problem with this game. In all honesty, it's the game Activision should have released a year and a half ago, in version 1. Nothing has changed all that much, other than fixing the much maligned bugs and quirks of version 1. The interface is essentially the same, as is the feel of the game, which is less than enjoyable. I'm a big Civ fan, but I must admit a certain disappointment that the Civ II engine seems to be more fun and interesting than any of the new Civ releases like Call to Power, or Alpha Centauri, even though it was developed over five years ago. If your a Civ fan and want to have fun, pick up a copy of Civ II: Test of Time. The engine is the same as Civ II, but you can automate settlers, autobuild cities, and have a choice between classic, extended, science fiction and fantasy variants of the game. Sadly, I'm sure you'll be much happier with Test of Time than you would be with Call to Power II."
2,it's the AI,hii bought this game hoping for a really improved civ2 type of game.I have to be honest the AI of your passive computer opponents is absolutely horrible.Once you fortify your cites the computer opponents just lay back and wait for you to attack and that's it. The diplomacy in the game has many options but they usually have the same pat answers for everything. activision has promised some text to come out on how to tweak the ai but no mention of a patch for this.can't recommend this game. try alpha centauri instead.tom
2,same as the first one,no wonder cid mier took back the rights to civilization there is nothing new in the part 2 of the series
4,Oldie but goodie,"I've played Civilization V, and I still prefer this game for the realism. It has a cool Civilopedia, and I've spent hours just reading it. It even conjectures into the future, such as space cities and sea cities. My favorite part is the stealth units. The ecoterrorist, although politically incorrect after 9/11, is a pretty realistic addition to the game, especially considering that up until 2001 the main threat to homeland security was ecoterrorism. I also like the ability to use a lawyer to file injunctions and lawsuits.The governments are realistic too, with controversial forms of government like a corporatocracy (referred to in the game as a corporate republic) and a fanatically-green government that has the ability to build ""green nukes."" You can also stack units, which makes military campaigns less of a pain.Yes, it is buggy, but still fun."
1,"Terrible, don't waste money wait for civ3","Activision can't make Civilization, only Sid Meirs can. don't waste money wait for Civilization 3"
3,Shipping mistake,"I am supposing that the onion rice crackers are better tasting than what I actually received, which were the plain unsalted ones. They are wonderfully crispy, but extremely bland. . .good with dip or a spread, but awful by themselves."
4,On the verge,"I caught this band the other night on the PBS show ""Austin City Limits"". Every song they did was unique, and very well done. The song that really stuck in my head was the title track from this album, More Adventurous. I'm really a fan of jazz, but I can certainly recognize talent, and these guys are headed for the top."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I checked this out after hearing the song ""I Never"" in the movie ""John Tucker Must Die"". Quite happy with getting the whole CD rather than just that single track."
3,Not my 1st (or 2nd) Rilo Kiley album choice,"I've noticed on this site that you find a lot of opinions that seem as though they are promoters pushing an album rather than taking a stab at objectivism with respect to the album.I've heard Rilo Kiley around the L.A. scene for years. They've always shown great character in their albums. The music, simple and catchy, the vocals emotional and blunt. This album was sort of let down for me. It just sort of did nothing for me. The album is clean, polished, and grown up. Not in a ""this band is maturing"" sort of way, but in the ""why is Billy Idol puting out another album"" sort of grown up. It's ok, it just seems like they wanted to take a stab at mainstream radio, which is great music for some people, just not for me. I definately recommend ""The Execution of All Things"" over this album."
3,nice,"i love rilo kiley and this album turned out to be rather good. though some songs are hard to get into ('i never' for example) other songs are really really right on key (my personal favorite on this album is a short one, 'ripchord'). i'm not going to claim this is my favorite rilo kiley album, but if you're a fan or just trying to jump into the 'scene', you won't be upset with this."
2,And I was so looking forward to this...,"I fell in love with Rilo Kiley by mistake: I got my signals crossed, and thought I was ordering this CD when I was really ordering The Execution of All Things. Boy am I glad it was that way and not the other way around. Rilo Kiley's earlier work offers an intelligent and quirky view of the world, not blind to the dangers of modern life but still folky optimistic. Unfortunately, on this album the folk-colored glasses fell off. Jenny Lewis's voice has always had a faint little-girl impurity to it, but on this album it's wavered into whiny. This only serves to exaggerate the decline in songwriting; what used to be poetic and complex has fallen to overly simplistic accounts of disappointments. I truly hope that this phenomenal band recovers from their attempts to be ""more adventurous"" and return to the beauty of their roots."
2,Better luck next time . . . .,"This album reminds me of why I stopped buying albums. One or two good songs just doesn't justify spending the money. I became interested in Rilo Kiley after listening to Execution of All Things. Sadly, this album is a let down. The music isn't very catchy and has too many long lyrics that sound forced."
4,It's a Hit,"What to say. This album, as with any Rilo album is fun. Sure they got a new record deal and recorded a slick album. More power to them. If you get a chance see them live."
2,Boring,"I first heard Portions for Foxes on the radio and absolutely loved it. Loved the fun lyrics and her voice. I bought the album and was totally disappointed. I found it to be very boring. I thought maybe I wasn't in the right mood to listen to it seeing all these great reviews about the album, but I've listened to it like 4 times and just find myself bored. Can't seem to get into it."
5,Hope for the future of music,"I am an old fogey when it comes to music -- mostly I spend my money replacing old vinyl albums as they come out on CD. However, Rilo Kiley's ""More Adventurous"" gives me hope for the future of music. At once melodic, lyric, and highly original, it's the best new album I've heard in years."
4,Awesome album,"I had no idea who Rilo Kiley was until I herd ""Portions for Foxes"" on the radio. I'm not a long time member of their fan club or been following them ""before they were somebody"". That being said, I love this album! Every song is not perfect but I just find it difficult to take out of my CD player. I when I do switch to listen to my IPOD via iTrip, I find myself going to RK on my playlists. The first three songs could all be singles (two are, in fact - ""It's a Hit"" and ""Portions for Foxes"", the other: ""Does he love you?"") and I have no problem listening to them over and over. ""I Never"" is also a highlight. A man/me/then jim is kinda slow but really solid. ""More adventurous"" is the title track and has some great lyrics. I really am in love with Jenny Lewis' voice and the rest of her isn't so bad either. Good stuff."
4,"different, but somehow not","this album wasnt what i expected. but then again, theyd previewed these songs live before and they were awesome. the record sound is obviously more polished, and i think a lot of people are going to dislike that. but every song on this album is catchy and completely rilo kiley. their last three cds were amazing, and while there is nothing extraordinary like 'with arms outstretched' or 'pictures of success,' there are some really great tracks like 'love and war' and 'jim,' and i guarantee you will play it over and over, because it never stops being a really fun and simply enjoyable album//"
4,Over Produced... But still good.,"The album is great. The lyrics, the music, and especially the singing. BUT, the album is simply over produced. If you compare these album tracks to live tracks available at rilokiley dot net or at soundeclectic dot com, you almost feel like the producer did not believe that Jenny's voice and Blake's melodies could carry the album, which is total nonsense. Through the album you find them adding random instruments to fill a void that should have been left open; it detracts from the simplicity and almost folk feel of the songs."
4,It's great!,"Rilo Kiley is a fun band. I just heard about them, and got the More Adventurous cd from a friend, and it's great! I love it! The lyrics are so much fun to listen to, and the songs are really catchy! I definitely recommend it!"
2,Ehhhh,"It was not all that it was cracked up to be. I expected more, judging by the reviews I was reading. The cd starts off strong, but then goes in a dismal, boring blah kind of place."
1,"Next time, new producer.","Mark Trambino has made Rilo Kiley suck. Their previous albums, ""Execution of all Things"" and ""Take-offs and Landings"" have been lush and beautiful. The over-production makes them sound very ordinary. Another exmaple of a record label taking a good band and wrecking them (see also Less Than Jake, Midtown, Against Me!, )"
2,Warning,"I purchased this CD after hearing ""Rabbit Fur Coat"" and wanting more by Jenny Lewis. While it is probably an ok pop record, it is nowhere near as good as the aforementioned. The songwriting is not nearly as mature. It really is just another pop record. I have listened to it about four times thinking that it might grow on me but it has not and I will try to off-load it as soon as possible."
1,GREAT MARKETING TEAM,"This seems like one of those albums people think they're supposed to like because Spin magazine tells them it's cool. Maybe I'm wrong, but I just don't get this group. The only catchy song on this album is portions for foxes. The rest is dead air."
2,beautiful voice but way over produced (cd la,"I only heard a few songs, her voice is very beautiful for you to not like but it reminds me of an Christian Aimee Grant cd meets Country! After awhile you sort of feel like this is an soundtrack to a children's movie. If your more into indie rock I would recommend The Postal Service, Metric, Stars, Denali, Mae! Something with more depth and emotions!This album was recommended from the postal service it seriously lacks!"
1,More Adventurous Rilo Kiley,"Quite frankly, this album is not good... or even fair for that matter. It is extremely bland and tasteless. I am actually quite fond of this genre of music, if it is done right. This one just does not tip the iceberg, so to speak. It is boring, and the musical content does not sound like it was recorded by professional musicians. On this album, ""More Adventurous"" the music is as creative as a W2 form. I absolutly applaude any human being that claims to have an ear for good music that can find the courage and will power to subject their ear drums to such brutal and grotesque defilement. This album is certainly one for the brave."
4,A step UP. Not down. A better execution of an album.,"I liked ""Executions of All Things"", but I didn't love it. I enjoyed it for the handful of songs that drew me to buy the album, only to be sorely disappointed that the rest of it did not live up to my expectations. I thought the lyrics in its songs were not as good as they could have been. They did not match up to the quality of the songs' arrangement and instrumentation.So, here I am with lowered expectations as ""More Adventurous"" is released. And I'm surprised to find on the radio (KCRW) choice cuts off the album. And they all sound great! So, I buy the album. And this time, I'm pleased. Even that guy doesn't sound too much like Elliot Smith this time. (There can be only one Elliot Smith.)The lyrics in ""More Adventurous"" seem less clumsy than those in ""Execution of All Things"". And there are more songs in this album that leave a more lastingly good impression. I'm left more satisfied of this album. A definite step up. A well-executed effort."
4,pretty damn good,"With all the new hype over Rilo Kiley I was slightly concerned about this album. However fears relieved. Originally recorded for Saddle Creek it definately has the Omaha sound. The band definately branches out from their last two albums with more complex arrangements. Lewis, often criticised for her girlish voice really shows the reach. ""I Never"" is so unlike her usual sound. Its practically a country ballad. Which I'm not a really a fan of. But Lewis' voice is astounding. The lyrics as always are penetrating and on this album branch out into interesting criticism on war and American culture, like ""Its a Hit"" a truly insightful song. The lyrics seem far more personal for Lewis for example ""Does he love you"". Its a great album, but i still prefer Excecution of All Things."
4,swope,"Most older movies seem tame. Not this one! ""Putney Swope"" doesn't pull any punches and is STILL ahead of the times as far as portraying race relations in an honest and funny way.A word of caution: This movie is extremely low budget and extremely irreverent. Much of it seems made-up from moment to moment. But there are some hilarious, brilliant moments in this."
5,How many syllables Mario?!,"The above line is just one of many that you will be quoting for days after watching this great, great movie. I'm probably not smart enough to write the review this movie deserves, as it touches on themes I am unaware of. I laughed a lot, though. If you like movies that emerged from the countercultural America of the 1960's and you haven't seen this you are in for a rare treat. After I first viewed it around ten years ago I watched it over and over. I am so glad to finally have this gem on DVD."
5,"A hilarious comedy rarely matched today, poignant!","""you look like an Oreo cookie. That says it all. Before Richard Pryor we had Swope. The advertising world will never be the same. A film you will remember forever!"
3,Quirky cult classic?,"I bought this movie for my dad for christmas since he always talks about it. He saw it when it first came out in theaters and said it was hilarious. There are tons of pop culture references in the dialogue that I had absolutely no idea what they were talking about. Guess you had to have been around then and hip enough to understand all the references. It is very much of the moment at the time it was made, Somewhat entertaining. Funny at times. Probably serves as a great historical reference of popular culture at the time and for that reason is worth seeing."
1,Edited not the same film as original,They edited this version and changed the ending from the original. Like a nonstop flight. t was stated as unedited when I ordered it. I would return it but to who?
3,Hillarious Satire of Madison Avenue,"This movie had me in stitches the first time I viewed it. Though it seems very dated, the movie still holds up. Note the dubbed voice of Arnold Johnson. That was actually Robert Downey, Sr. Also notice ""Huggy Bear"" from Starsky & Hutch."
2,What Was I Thinking!,"When I first saw this movie I must have been on a contact high from the people getting stoned in the ""art"" theater I saw it in. I thought in 1969 it was brilliant. Then each ensuing decade I would try to watch it at least once every 10 years. Well to my surprise the movie has a consistant nature to it. It gets progressively worse with each viewing! In short; terrible camera work, bad sound, bad acting, bad direction, amateur editing, crass, vulgar, irritating, unfunny, distorted cynical view of life. A waste of Allen Garfield who is the only one who comes away unscathed by this ""B"" movie (well add a couple of token hot women to that list). Other than that don't waste your life on this ""soul song"" that hits a very sour note! Disposable art!"
3,"People, nobody will vote for him, so....","thats the logic behind this movie. A single man makes a busiess for the people and by the people One man single handedly turns big business civic minded. Putney, a hep cat, makes the business grow. Not bad, a little heavy handed at times, but not bad"
3,WTF?!?!?!,"whoooooa... hold on just a minute there! $18.99 for three friggin tracks?!?!??! nooooo thank you! poprocks&coke is a good song, so is she, and fod. but the same rec as on the tune in tokyo? please! just get the tokyo and international superhits! please! this is insane! i'm a green day fan, but this is crazy!"
5,Awesome,"I've had this unit for about a month now and think its a great HU. The interface takes alittle getting used to, but the learning curve is really fast. I've had no problems installing the unit, although the instuctions from Kenwood need some help. I defintely would recommend to anyone looking to replace their radio and looking for an all in one this should be the unit. The navigation by Garmin is awesome. Not only are the maps great, but it also has built in knowledge of traffic rules. If you drive around in Jersey at all and have to use jug handles, you will really appreciate that. I didn't replace the speakers in my car, but the DNX7100 has definetly made them sound better. You will not go wrong by buying this all in one radio"
3,"Great unit, lousy customer service","I have now had this unit installed for over 4 months and am in the process of removing it for the third time. The first time was due to a malfunction with the CD/DVD drive which was promptly repaired under warranty after I finally got them to provide me with the necessary info as to where to send it. The second time was to install the XM radio receiver (the model number was provided by Kenwood customer service) and this last time is to remove the XM receiver since it was in fact the incorrect model number. I really like the unit, but I have no faith in their customer service and I have spent as much time taking the unit in and out as I have using it. If you need information for warranty repair or accessories it seems this part of the product equation they can't get right."
4,Nice to have,"I have read the other reviews and agree with most of them. The animals were kind of looked at as almost 2nd tier when they hit the states, but they always demanded respect as having a unique sound and for not being a sellout to the pop scene. I do remember distinctly being a small kid at the time that ""When I Was Young"" hit the air. Man that song woke some people up! If ""Rising Sun"" wasn't pain enough for the white kids, then this one kicked you for real. Burden was to be taken seriously. I personally saw him in the later form of the animals as trying a bit too hard to be part of the love generation, when the bluesy stuff really was where he belonged. This compilation is a good one to have if you always liked the animals, but for some reason chose to spend what money you had on the more popular British invasion bands. As a whole, this CD is tops."
2,Interference from wireless router,I bought this phone for my home office.The cordless phone has major interference from my wwireless internet router. I was on the phone with phone company for 6 hours and even had a tech come to my house.The only way to resolve the problem is to unplug the router.I would not buy this phone if you are worried about interference.maybe a 5.8 ghz would be better
5,Great product!,"I bought this for a 27"" tube TV a few years back but I'm still using it with my new LCD tv. For the old TV it was a bit too small, so I cut a board just a little bigger than the TV, set it on top of the swivel, and the TV on top of that. Worked great! Now, I still use the board, but only because it allows me to place two speakers on it in front of the TV and have them move with the screen!"
5,Love this CD,"This is such a fun album! If you have ever watched the ""Arthur"" cartoons, this is a must-have. It is full of fun beats, songs that fit the characters, and great plays on words. Awesome!"
5,"Must have for all kids who are ""Arthur"" fans","This is an excellent CD with the delightful music from the Arthur PBS Show. My children listen to it over and over. They dance around the room singing, laughing and enjoying all the songs. A definite holiday gift for kids of all ages."
2,"I'm Outnumbered, But I Hate It!","well, it looks like i'm alone here, but i LOATHE this cd. which is a shame because my 19-month-old daughter LOVES arthur with all her heart. (i gave it 2 stars only to allow for the excellent tv-show theme song.) so with the exception of the wonderful theme song, this whole cd is nothing but annoying. so much so that i hid it away in storage. she (and we) like the dragon tales cd MUCH better."
4,"My kids love it, so do I, my wife doesn't","My two boys (ages 2 and 4) love it. I like all the musical styles - reggae, hip-hop, classical. However, my wife doesn't care for it. Her preference for kids music is more along the ""Barney"" style of music. So this CD gets played either when my wife is in another part of the house or when my boys and I are in the car alone."
5,I think Arthur is the best show ever!,"I started to watch this show since I've been in the 5th grade. Now I'm in the 7th - and still like it! Arthur and his friends are talking about popular subjects, not as the other cartoon when they talk about things that were popular in the 80's, usually. Watching Arthur is really fun. It's not for young children, it is for all ages! I have to buy the CD and other stuff from here. JUST HAVE!"
3,Unnecessary Set-Up Difficulty,"I purchased this tool through Amazon/Tool Crib. No problems in receiving the tool. The tool performs as advertised and was a very good price. The reason I gave it three stars was due to the difficulty I experienced in setting the grinder up. The grinder includes two spark deflector (plexi-glass) lenses. For some idiotic reason, Delta choose to adhere stickers (advertising) to these lenses. The stickers must be removed to see the grinding wheel through them. The stickers were not the easy to peel off type that you would expect, but must have been adhered to the lenses with superglue. It was very difficult removing these stickers and the spark deflectors were scratched in the process. This whole exercise was unnecessary and extremely frustrating. Now I am reminded everytime I look through the scratched lenses."
4,"A bit off track for the creators, but still a good listen","I've enjoyed David Arkenstone's music for quite some time, and have been a fan of Mercedes Lackey's writing even longer. Seeing the two of them collaborating, not once but twice, should pique the interest of anyone who enjoys either's work.Now the bad news, if there is any for this creation...based on Lackey's novels and short stories, it seems like she wrote the backstory to support this album almost as an afterthought; heavy reliance on ""deus ex machina"" plot devices leave die-hard Lackey fans cold. At times the story gets in the way of the music; at others, the other way around. Perhaps the story was aimed at younger audiences?I'm happy to rate this at 4/5, but a better story would have gained an extra star."
3,50's Sci-fi,"No better or worse than any other 50's Sci-fi. If you collect this Genre, you might want these. Typical Drive-in horror movies that are fun for the family. If your family likes simple non-gore, no swearing, no sex, movies, that are good for Family nite Fright nite movie fests. They are also fun to have a few laughs at the Drive-in Horror Genre of the 50's."
3,Never seen these before so took a chance.,I really can't make up my mind on these two. Sort of a thumbs sideways. I did watch it two times to get a better impression.
3,good double creature feature,"The Day the World Ended had a creature, but it still played out as more of a character study. It was entertaining, but not deep nor was there much science in this old science fiction movie. The better movie of the two was The She-Creature. It had a mysterious monster, a control freak, a funny drunk, cleaver special effects, and a damsel distressed. Knowing how a movie will end does not mean you know the path to that end. This monster movie had some suspence. I'll watch it again. Thank you Amazon for making these old movies available."
3,Apocalypse whenever,"These two flicks are ok if you are into into 1950s mediocrity. I saw Day The World Ended on tv when I was a kid, because I was fascinated by the concept of the scary 'end of the world' scenario, by an atomic war. The art on the promo poster really hypes this up a lot, but I found the actual story not quite the action-packed drama I expected.Likewise for the She Creature. I feel the viewers are let down by what the story delivers. I cannot say for sure how these 2 films will strike each who see it, I can only give you my reaction. Perhaps my tastes changed over the years, but you may find these quaint."
2,"Decent production values, but poor end of the world story","Regarding The Day The World Ended, if the effects of radioactivity were given consistently, and they'd left the rapid monster mutation in three weeks out of it, this might have been another interesting story of a motley group of people waiting out the fallout from a holocaust. If the surrounding bowl of hills really did contain lead ore, the water would probably be too dangerous to drink for that reason alone, however.The She Creature is a fantasy mood piece."
3,Not what it could have been.,"I've been waiting for some time for someone to finally release a copy of Day the World Ended in widescreen as it was originally released. Unfortunately, Lionsgate did it WRONG. Although they obviously used a real widescreen print as their source, for some reason of their own they formatted it into the wrong screen ratio for their DVD--using 2.35 to 1 instead of the original 1.88 to 1, which cuts off the top and bottom of the picture (in one scene, for example, you get to see a talking NOSE at the bottom of the screen). This is part of a disturbing trend among DVD producers, who are apparently trying to cater to the widescreen TV crowd (which makes it even MORE unusual that Lionsgate went 2.35 to 1--as it will have to be letterboxed even on a widescreen TV!), at the expense of the original film formats (which sometimes results in people with half-heads and no feet). At least She Creature is full screen (closer to the original 1.33 to 1 ratio), but the print is a bit dark."
3,"Fun, Cheap Thrills of Yesteryear","This is fun bottom-dollar cinema from Roger Corman, Alex Gordon and Samuel Z. Arkoff. The presentations are not top-shelf, but that comes with age and the cut-rate production. The man-in-a-rubber suit is a hoot and the acting is on par with Mystery Science Theater. Don't expect this double creature feature to scare your 6 year-old."
4,"Great thickness, neat, professional, and badly packaged","These sleeves are excellent, unlike some of the others here on Amazon, they're industry-standard thickness and fairly reliable - nothing cheap and flimsy here. However, and most unfortunately, they come wrapped very tightly in a rubber band that ends up leaving a fairly nasty indentation straight through the center of 5-6 on both ends of the bundle, and crimps in the middle-top and middle-bottom of all the rest. There's absolutely no need for that rubber band to be there, and if they really must put a rubber band for some reason, then employing the use of a wider rubber band would have resulted in considerably less crimping. Makes it acceptable for home use, but probably not the impression you want to be giving out if you're using these to mail CDs or DVDs to your customers."
2,Wrinkly plastic window,"I've been ordering this same brand of Memorex CD/DVD sleeves for maybe five years. I could deal with the decreasing quality every year. It was always better (thicker paper) than the next major brand or a no-name.This year -- no more. The plastic window was low quality for all 100 sleeves, loud and wrinkly and distractingly reflective with all the wrinkles. I'm so dissatisfied I'm going to return these.Another cheaper name-brand I accidentally bought a year before (also beginning with letter ""M"") with slightly thinner paper, at least is uniform and has a clear unwrinkled window."
3,Poorly packaged,Leave the the rubber band off the sleeves already boxed up. Ruined about 5 sleeves. The box served its purpose!
4,paper,paper sleeves not as nice looking as the plastic ones but they will protect my cd's and I can see the cd inside sleeve easily
3,Rubber band ruins the product.,There really is no need for the rubber band to hold these sleeves. I would have given this product 5 stars. It seems like they are there only to make it easier to separate and sort. Who cares about the customer satisfaction as long as the company is happy I suppose.
4,"Product works well, packaging is flawed and bends some sleeves","The sleeves are quality and hold the CDs/DVDs well, I can even fit two CDs in a sleeve if I am patient. The rubber band holding the sleeves inside the box is unnecessary and causes a crease in the sleeves on the top and bottom of the stack. See the photo above for how mine look as delivered Jan 2013. The bent sleeves still work just fine for me. I wouldn't want to give them out to a client or someone else but I am not seriously concerned about it. I docked one star on my rating because of this packaging flaw."
3,Only adequate for The Pretenders fans,"I wish I had known this dvd consisted of only 9 songs played live. The quality of the dvd is very grainy. However, if you are a fan of The Pretenders its probably worth having. Bottom line...the price (nearly $18 when purchased) was a bit expensive for the quality and length of this dvd."
2,Lame - terrible quality dvd of a good performance,"This dvd is merely a very grainy transfer of a VH-1/Hard Rock concert. Viacom's lawyers should look into this because the VH-1 logo is in the bottom right corner of the screen, and there's no way VH-1/Viacom would've ever licensed out shoddy product like this. It's really no better than a pro-shot bootleg - very grainy/fuzzy. The case claims it's in 5.1, but when i put it in 5.1 on my system, i basically got the SAME sound out of every speaker - i highly doubt this is 5.1. Sound is overall decent though, but the terrible picture quality sinks this release. The performance is good, though, but the disc only runs around 42 minutes or so, so this thing is pricey for what you get. You'd be better off with just about any of the other legitimate Pretenders DVD's - the Wiltern one is excellent, and there's a new Blu-ray just out. You'd be far better off buying this:Pretenders - Loose In L.A."
1,1 star DVD 5 star group and performance....bootleg alert!,"Hi Folks,the other reviewers are right...this is a VH1 show that looks to be bootlegged and on top of it the 4x3 aspect ratiohas been artificially made widescreen so the image is not only 5th generation fuzzy and grainy but stretched...YUUUCKam I still glad I have this ..of course...Chrissie and her boys rock but would I be happier if it was a legit licensed release with the direct VH1 footage...ABSOLUTELY..be warned.....its like a bad VHS from the 70's but any footage of the Pretenders is a day to celebrate for me...OH and GET THE NEW DVD..LIVE IN LONDON its fabulous!!"
3,flamingo kid,"After following this great woman and her different band line-ups for 30 years now, it's nice to have this in the collection. But I've seen much better shows than this one recorded in NYC. Since Adam and Andy are no longer playing with her, it's just good to have them on video. They were her longest running band-mates other than Martin and inducted into the R'n'R Hall of Fame with her. So hats off. and it's just o.k. in my opinion."
3,Parlez-vous quebecois?,"Yes, you guessed it, the French that people speak in Canada is somewhat different that the French spoken in France. There are many antique words, regionalisms, and slang which would bedazzle any Frenchman. That, however, is not what this book is about. You see, the pronunciation is different too! The author shows us how the pronunciation of Canadian French (quebecois) differs from French French. He gives us insights into how the changes in pronunciation came about, and how we can learn to pronounce the almost musical language of our northern neighbors. It is a great book for those who live in Quebec or those who plan on travelling to the ""Belle Province""."
5,Best of 2005: Magical,"Like many people, I learned about Seu Jorge through his participation in the music for ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"". I found his work interesting, but not particularly engaging. But ""Cru"" totally got me into his work, head in first. He reminds me of the legendary Brazillians that brought Brazil's contagious music to the forefront of the collective conscience, the likes of Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil and Chico Buarque. Jumping from laid back to upbeat, from an urban beat to more of a serenade mellow sound, Seu Jorge will capture you with his magical music from the first track of this, one of 2005's best albums."
1,Fun for masochists...,"Some movies are bad...but this one really creates a whole new level of awful. C. Thomas Howell stars as an escaped con aboard a futuristic prison-transport spaceship who escapes and holds the plane hostage, while the hero tries to thwart him and save them all (which he does, of course. What do you expect?). It's terrible: terrible acting, terrible writing, terrible special effects. It's an hour and a half of your life you'll never get back. Turn away now."
1,"This ""sleeping dog"" should be put to sleep","A very bad movie in general. Too many scenes with ""actors"" running around, shooting things and just looking confused.(I was confused my self by the lack of plot). It's as though scenes from 100 other bad movies were compiled to make this one, amazingly bad movie.It's sort of like the 3 stooges in space but not funny."
2,You know what's really depraved?,"The fact that they had a plot like this and actors attractive and competent enough to have made this a really interesting film, but apparently had no idea at all of how to do so. Man, what a different wrtiter and director could've done with this!"
1,Great!! What an Adventure!!,I loved the story the adventure never ended. I have an older brother and I could almost feel like Christy the younger sister. The ghost kids part was so exciting the magical blue vase was great. Uncle Charlie said he was sorry and said family and friends were more important than money. That made me happy. Hunting for the pirates treasure was the most exciting. I felt that I was right there with the whole familly. A must read for everyone. Wendy
4,Keeps coffee hot,This is a great thermos it keeps the coffee hot all day. The only issue we had was the bottom of the thermos bubbled out so the thermos can't stand up.
5,The best thermos,This is the best thermos ever. Keeps coffee hot all day and night. I beat mine up and it still lasted for years. Finally lost it and had to replace. Got the same one.
5,Thermos,"This is one great way to carry a hot drink to work, be careful though after several hours it much hotter than I expected, I left only one cup in the thermos and 24 hours latter that one cup was steaming when I refilled it the next day. It's Great"
2,Poor design,"Not happy with it used to the old design, Why do companys have to change things. The old design fit nice into my napsack, New design bulges, ( TOO TALL BY 3 Inches )"
5,well pleased,Product was exactly as described. Will keep hot coffee hot enough to drink for over 12 hrs. without heating bottle first.
5,Perfect for what we needed,I purchased this for my husband so he could take coffee to work. It keeps it hot all day long. He seems to like it and hasn't had any complaints. He works in a shop with no heat in the winter so it's very cold in there but the coffee stays steaming hot.
3,Love the shirt.,"the shirt is awesome, but the dvd is nothing new. They need to release a special edition for region 1, I've seen some of the other regions have 2 disc editions, loaded with interviews and behind the scenes, well maybe someday we'll get one. This is such a great movie and deserves a special edition."
2,Lousy Blu-Ray Disc,"The actual film gets 4 out of 4 from me (amazon and most sites only let you rate 5 out of 5), but after close to a year of waiting after this disc got pushed back and back, the end result is a completely unacceptable Bluray disc. The image quality, I'm sorry to say, is no different than the DVD and looks to be derived from the DVD with marginally increased sharpness. The sound quality is what made me return the disc. The Japanese Dolby Digital 5.1 track sounds AWFUL! Worse than the DVD, which had a great 5.1 mix. Also, it looks as if the only Dolby True-HD tracks on the disc are both English and Japanese Dolby TrueHD 2.0! Why would you include an HD 2.0 mix on an HD disc that most definitely has 5.1 audio. I've seen 'Ichi the Killer' theatrically and know all too well that it looks and sounds better than this. Sorry I had to burst the bubbles of many eager 'Ichi' fans (myself included), but I sent this back almost immediately after buying it. A shame."
4,I Love Asian Cinema,"This is a pretty sick little tale, but you'd expect nothing less from Miike. A completely original and unpredictable movie, it has undeniable replay value, and it's so much fun to show your friends. The ending is my favorite though."
5,Great package,"The package is great; it will take you some time to know how to get the DVDs in and out the blood bag but after a while it gets so damn easy.The movie is great of course, loads of blood and violence. The features will provide you with everything you need to know about the movie, actors and director.I give the movie 9/10, features 9/10, package 9.5/10."
5,BRUTAL!,"This is non stop brutality at it's finest,definitley one of my favorites that I have seen recently.CHECK THIS OUT SOON!"
3,Ichi,"Well, i watched this movie and it was kind of cool/disgusting. Full of gorey and gruesome scenes. This movie was dragged out a little too long and should of been shorter and had a few stupid scenes that should of never been in it."
2,Poor quality transfer,"I bought this simply because it is the unrated version. I already own the UK release of this film which is not uncut, however, I will not be watching this ""Tokyo Shock"" version ever again, uncut it may be but the picture quality is appalling!! It's dark, the colours are washed out and the whole thing has a murky, out of focus look about it, compared it to the ""Premier Asia"" UK release which is bright, colourful crisp and clear. There really is no excuse for this lacklustre effort, it seems to be pure shoddiness and a let's get it in the shops ASAP approach instead of the care and dedication to get a quality product on the market for the fans of the market. My recommendation??? Get the UK, ""Premier Asia"" version, it may be slightly trimmed but it is a far better product and has a host of extra's to boot, you won't be disappointed!!"
2,Dissapointing,"I love the work of Takashi Miike, he can make any story seem new again with his surrealist style of filmaking. But this was just an overated, incoherent gorefest with the most blatant excuse for mutliple stories and events to come together. Some may say I didn't get it but I don't WANT to get it. Lots of violence that goes nowhere, girls get raped and die in some brutal and sick ways, random scenes that add nothing to the film or plot. Just a whole lot of nothing from a director that has made a few of THE BEST films I have ever seen. The acting is actually done very well from the lead guy Tadanobu Asano and some even better acting from Ichi's right hand man in the film played by Shinya Tsukamoto (who made the excellent films Tetsuo the iron man and Tokyo Fist). But other then the good acting, this falls right on its ass with the rampant violence and gore.Don't believe the hype."
5,Sodimise my brain please!,"Oh my, this is one of the most disturbing and fullfilling films I've seen in the last year. I've stumbled upon this movie purely by chance and I'm glad that I have. The movie takes you down the streets of Japanese gang life, sex, pain, and rape.I was deeply enthralled by this movie and love the creative quirks it has given me. If you're easily disturbed, don't watch this movie. And if you like violence in your movies, you may want to think again. This takes violence into a light that most american's don't see, ART.All I have to say is, I enjoyed having my brain raped, beaten, placed in bondage and continuely sodimized by this movie!"
5,Great gory action,"Takashi Miike writes/directs/produces some amazingly thought-provoking stuff. If it's the excessive gore or the overly-stereotyped characters gone macabre, it catches you in a way you're comfortably uncomfortable. Tadanobu Asano is an amazing actor, doing hopeless romantics to completely messed-up, violent yakuza guys. Besides, he's quite nice to look at!Getting this on Blu-ray was a no-brainer, as one of the most-watched movies we owned. Sharing this with friends is always a delight. Many have now become Miike and Tadanobu fans, and that's how I like it."
5,Takashi Miike's Quintessential!,"This movie turned me onto Takashi Miike and I have been in love ever since!What can I say about Ichi the Killer? Using only one word: Fantastic!Ichi the Killer is THE goriest movie I have ever seen! The hook-hanging scene is priceless! This movie has the kind of violence you expect to see in Asian cinema, but this one can be a little ""over the top"" at times. But guess what, I'm still in love!If you're looking to get into Asian Cinema, look no further than Ichi the Killer. You may even want to check out the prequel as well..."
2,Big Gross Out Disappointment,"Miike is an imaginative, clever director but his films are a decidedly mixed bag: often surreal, beautiful, grotesque, tedious and original. ""Ichi the Killer"" is all of that and without a doubt his most extreme work--which is saying alot! It's quite cooly disgusting in a cartoonish way but after a short while it runs out of steam and drags along from one over-the-top sequence to another. It totally lacks the emotion and suspense that ""Audition"", his best film, had.By the way, the video transfer is solid but the image is too dark."
2,DROP IN QUALITY,I'm not saying don't buy this if you like Miike's work but after Audition I thought he had finally found himself as a film maker and was going to produce more quality product. This film is instead a big step backwards to his earlier cheap Yakuza films and has a slapped together/ improv vibe to it. Massive amounts of violence no doubt but to what end? If you really want to see the best of Japanese cinema than check out the films of Beat Takeshi.
2,over rated gore bore,"read below to find what it's about... as a film this is not enjoyable...however it's set up nicely with all the pretty colours and interestingly dressed characters and so on...yet this movie is so incredibly nihilistic that it becomes boring with no real sense of morality to balance the film's ultraviolence. i appreciate some of the action and gore...yet as said before me, the torture and rape scenes are particularly CAREFUL and DELIBERATE in that Miike goes through great lengths to make sure we are disturbed by it all...and the story itself unfolds rather slowly. in short this is a gorey bore."
1,I wouldn't give this movie away to my worst enemy,"The overexcess of gore and violence does NOT make up for the terribly weak plot of this movie. I was hardly able to finish Ichi the Killer and it's not often or ever I turn off, or walk out of a movie. I am going to take a shotgun to this dvd so that no man will ever be able to say ""I wasted an hour and a half watching this garbage.""DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!!"
3,Holy God. I think my eyes are bleeding.,"Ok, I'd like to think that I've seen my share of crazy Japanese movies. This one took the cake. Maybe I didn't catch enough of the references, or maybe I wasn't strung out on heroin. Either way, this movie was hard to follow. When your movie's hero is crying AND reassuring a woman that things will be ok, because HE'LL rape her instead of someone else... Well, stretch that scene into an hour and a half and you've got this movie."
5,crazy,this is one crazy flick. i didnt get how this crybaby can kill everybody but he does. but why does the oldman kill himself?
5,R rated fun,"one hell of a ride !a sadistic masochist yakuza gangster kakihara ,looking for hisboss's killer,a cry baby psycho called ichi.this search willcause a gorey hurrican in the yakuza underground.twistinggangsters, prostitutes,ex-cops,dirty cops,intestines and evenschool bullies in one spectacular and crazy twister of a film.from takashi miike who gave us that enjoyable and nauseous film audition.ichi the killer manga creator hideo yamamoto joins miike on the commentary in the dvd extras.p.s. an anime based on the manga is going to be released by centralparkmedia on september 21st 2004.it's going to be called ichi the killer episode 0.miike does kakihara's voice in the anime.it's already avalable in the uk . check out amazon.co.uk ."
3,"Thrilling, but not a masterpiece","Great for the most part, but some parts were obviously CG. Probably not a movie you'd enjoy seeing over and over again."
4,Cinematic sideways!,"I love Takashi Miike's directing and Ichi The Killer is destined to be a cult classic. It's a one of a kind Yakuza movie for sure. Ultra violent, bizarre, twisted, funny, just a few words to describe this movie. It has many interesting scenes and intriguing characters that will probably leave some scratching their heads in disbelief, if the heavy deviant sexual themes like sadism, masochism, rape and torture don't. Not for the sqeamish! If you like Japanese V-Cinema and Tokyo Shock, you should appreciate and enjoy this and all the unique and stylish work of Takashi Miike. The unrated version is the way to go here. I want to be in one of his movies!"
2,"MAKES NO SENSE, HAS NO PLOT","Like most of Miike's movies, this makes no sense whatsoever. It has a couple good, graphic yakuza torture scenes (one involving fish hooks and boiling tempura-oil) but otherwise it is plotless nonsense. All style and no substance."
3,Gorenography (with a story),"Rate this triple GGG--G for gore.Of course, GGG is not a rating; just as XXX is not a rating.) With a XXX film you know what you are getting. You know what you will be fast-forwarding through and fast-forwarding to. Will that happen with this GGG film? Will you fast forward through this warring gang film with its blond, split-cheek, half-tongue pyschopath antagonist and its traumatized, weeping, killing-machine pyschopath protagonist just to get to the gore?And what hardcore gore: what face-off, split-down-the-middle, big-a** fishhook-boiling-oil torture gore.I grow (not prudish) but squeamish."
4,Not what I expected,"Im glad I didnt waste money on buying this. I caught it on t.v. If you like gore then its fine. If you like hardcore violence that fine too. It was kind of hard to follow because of the subtitles, but it was a good movie that didnt have a good plot. It had plenty of violence, kick ass special effects and alot of sexual violence. It leads you in so many directions at once that you will get confused. I am a gore hound, so I enjoyed it, except the fact it didnt have a plot at all. If your into all the stuff that I have told you about..then maybe you would like it."
2,Ichie The Silly,"It's a good movie if you are looking for something for your child.I couldnt see ""good"" acting on any scene.This movie begins very good and after 30 minutes you start to pray god to make it stop.Takashi used anime style on "" all "" death scene and that makes the movie unreal.(ofcourse with bad acting)Whole movie contains unnecessary speeches and boring scenes that have not a subject.If you want to watch a real good gore movie dont waste your time with this(two stars for the torment scene, that's all)"
2,Amateur Night,"After reading so many positive reviews of this film, I took a chance, and got it. Bad Move. This film is amateurish from the top down. First, it looks like it was shot on a dollar budget with recycled fuji film. The acting (acting?) puts it in a class with ""Plan 9 From Outer Space."" As for the gory effects; a crybaby killer leaves a trail of red paint and pig intestines wherever he goes. Honestly, the whole film is so overdone, it is laughable. By the way, notice that the killer has a three inch blade that pops out of the heel of his shoe. With that blade he slices people in half! This is very effective if you are fighting 2 1/2 inch thick opponents!!! Any wonder this film never gained wide release in this country?"
1,No sizzle here ..............................,"There are a couple of good tunes, but a level of inspiration in the playing that could lift them is not there.Artists producing their own work is a situation fraught with danger - there is just not enough perspective on what really works and what doesn't. On one of the good tunes, ""So In Love"", Janice Dempsey has a nice voice but her diction is lacking. The background vocals by Rahni Song are good, but Janice, who is a co-writer with Rahni and Alex, is ultimately the weak link on this track. And it looks like Alex, as producer and co-writer with her, was just too close to the situation to step back and fix it.This cd is titled 107 Degrees In The Shade, but nothing is catching fire in the music."
1,makes all women sound feeling touchy,"Her views are too introspective,subjective and feely touchy.How can the book give a teenage girl or woman any sense ofconfidence or influence in the world,when the author isgeneralising about ""female behaviour"" whatever it is,anddividing men and women into two opposites unable tohave similar experiences.Certainly many a girl or woman has broken a boy or man'sheart.Many a boy or man have fallen in love and have hademotional trauma.One sterotype after another about how women are needy andbecome more needy after a sexual experience.There all here,double standards and sterotypes.Book does not empower women but makes women out to beemotionaly weak and unable to seperate sex and love."
1,Very Anti Sex,Women develope enough negative attitudes towards sex in thissociety.This book only adds to the negativity by saying womenare more hurt than men.I don't know how anyone can speak for most women as though she can read our minds.This rediculousthinking must stop.I can't believe it's 2005 and we stillbelieve double standards and outright lies.
1,"the Theory sounds good, but doesn't work","if the premise of the book had any validity, Baptist girls would not consistently have the highest rate of teenage pregnancy of any religious group...teens need real world sex education about STD's and birth control...when the hormones are raging, prayer just isn't up to the task...""JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE?"" -Growing Up A Baptist Fundamentalist-"
2,Not performs well,"I tried this sand belt to my Makita belt sander twice, but really disappointed for the performance and durability. I bought this just because of 3M brand name with the expectation of good quality, but it does not remove material well and not last long enough. Price is higher than most other brand but quality is way below that. Northon sand belt performs much better."
2,Sincerely Wrong,"Like the story ""The King Has No Clothes"", upon close examination we not a single verse in the New Testament instructing any church or saint to tithe. It is not there, period. Giving is, and the giving never went to fund buildings, organizations, and clergy lifestyles. Giving went to minister to brethren in need, and supplied basic needs to those ministers who were 100% dedicated to the ministry of the Word and prayer.Please see our book The Tithe That Binds and our site [...]This book does a GOOD job of putting for the tradition of men regarding tithing. We have heard all the justifications for a pactice that was never given to the church, even one or two not given in this book."
4,Free shipping isn't free,"As of 5/09, Lowe's has this model in stock locally for $438, so you're paying about $160 extra for ""free"" shipping from Amazon. Also, Harbor Freight appears to have a reconditioned version of this unit (or very similar), which they will ship to you for a total of only about $400. Looks like a good unit though; I will probably buy it shortly to replace my rusted-out, 10-year-old Devilbiss 26-gallon unit (when they say drain the tank after each use, they mean it!)."
2,Not worth it,"I had bought mine from a different source. After doing the 30min break in I put it to use.....well almost......It never reached it's shut off point the tank got VERY hot,hot enough it will burn and within 2 or 3 hours the oil was black.The air coming through the air line was so hot that you couldnt handle your air tool for very long.Im sooooo not happy with this"
2,POOR!,"First off, i bought mine at lowes. After cycling off i could hear hissing, poor weld at top of tank was leaking air...lots! I called the 1800 number and was told by the machine to call during normal hours and not during peak hours.... WTF, its 1pm!! I rewelded it my self, tank still fails to hold air, could not find leak so i filled the unit with freon and used freon leak detector. Its leaking out of the compressor, poor valves not sealing properly and come out the air intake. Also, this unit gets really hot during use, the tank get so hot you cant touch it after running nonstop for 1 hour, then the air gets so hot, the hose gets hot, and the nozzle on the sand blaster is so hot you cant hold it, and you have to stop so it can rest. The oil, is very dark after about 3 hours of use. Buy a better unit if you plan on using it for real."
3,Wrong Description for Item,"First of all, let me say that the problem I had is not with the window film itself. It performs as stated on the package. My problem is with the description on Amazon. This product was listed in their description as 20% VLT (visible light transmission), when in fact it is 2-1/2% VLT (a huge difference in whether your vehicle is street-legal or not)."
3,Window Tint,"The film wasn't exactly what I thought it would be,but it serves the purpose I needed it for.I work in the very early mornings(5am)so I go to bed very early while the sun is still up.I needed it to cut a bit more sunlight out of my bedroom so I could get to sleep a bit easier.It works fairly well,although it was rather difficult to handle alone.Also,I wonder why it was sent in 2 seperate boxes,when it was placed as one order.It certainly would have fit fine in one box.SincerelyJeff Dann"
3,Copco Torino looks great but doesn't deliver,"Not wanting an ordinary teakettle, we were drawn to the Copco Torino because of the graceful simplicity of its visual design. For that, I think it deserves an award. But in everday use we've found the Torino disappointing. Because the ""spout"" is actually a flange at the top of the kettle, you have to tip it almost upside down to get all the water out. As you do this, steam rises from the opening and makes your hand uncomfortably warm, even with the removable steam guard placed in the opening. If you grasp the handle lower to compensate for this, your palm contacts the metal heat guard at the bottom of the handle. Ouch! Also, the wide flange doesn't provide a well-focused stream of water. We'll be returning this one. Our quest for the perfect kettle goes on...."
5,Terrific Snapshot of Pivotal Moment in History,"This is a very concise, readable account of a critical week in 1940 when the British government was faced with the choice of suing for peace or continuing the fight with Germany. Using declassified records of cabinet discussions and detailed day-by-day opinion polls the author gives you and almost minute to minute feel of the changing mood of the country as the news of the disasters in France come in."
1,"Terrible, terrible writing on a great subject","One of the most compelling times in history is turned into a nightmare of footnotes, turgid writing, and phony melodrama. At one point the author makes fun of Chamberlain as being a holdover from the Victorian era, yet the writing in this book has all the bad points of writing from that era, and by someone who clearly thinks that he is the greatest historian of this era. You would do better with any of the other hundreds of books on the subject."
1,Fails to live up to expectations,"Based on his comments on his own work, Lukacs must be the greatest living historian. Therefore, one would expect that ""Five Days"" would be a commendable piece of historical writing. Oh, you would be wrong. It's confusing and dull. How one could make Churchill dull is beyond me, but maybe that is what makes Lukacs great: he can do the unimaginable. As for the confusion, perhaps Lukacs attempted to re-create the fog of war. Regardless, I finished the book and, with regret, felt that I had wasted a couple of hours of my time."
2,A frustrating presentation,"Lukacs argues, often effectively, that the period 24-28 May 1940, when the British War Council considered negotiating a peace with Hitler, were the vital days of WWII (when the war was ""not lost"").The principals were Churchill and Halifax, with Chamberlin as the key swing vote.The problem with the book is that it keeps veering off to talk about public opinion (although Lukacs demonstrates effectively, early on, that public opinion had no effect on the decision). Lukacs also often expresses forceful opinions without any support (no footnote, no discussion -- just a statement that someone ""was wrong"" in his opinions). The result is that the Churchill- Halifax debate is muted by trivia."
2,Boring,"The subject of the book 5 days in May 1940 is one of the key swing points in WW2. Lukacs book is boring, difficult to read and lacks sufficient support material to warrant the length of the work. It seems that the author had some facts and then spent the greater part of the book padding them out.There is for me no coherent form to the book as it zig zags from one subject to the next with no continuity in the process.The book could have been better structured and the language simplified to make it a much more readable piece of work which would have appealed to greater audience.The one point that the book was enlightening on the reasons put forward as to why Hitler held his advancing forces in check.One, he was not aware of the disarray in the French and British ranks and second, that a humiliated Britain would prove more formidable.The subject is worthy of an in depth treatment but this book fails to deliver in an interesting or entertaining way and I do believe that books should be both."
4,An Interesting Look At Early WWII Decision Making,"I had picked up a copy of the book awhile because I had heard good things about it. I did not get a chance to read it until recently. The book is an interesting read, but does not go into enough detail on some of the more important meetings going on at the time which is why I give it only four stars instead of five.The book details the events of the end of May 1940 when the Germans are overrunning France and the British are trying to extract their army and decide how to procede in the war if France drops out and/or Italy decides to enter on Hitler's side.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the early years of World War II and who wants to see how a democracy decides how it will fight a war it did not want, but must fight in order to protect the values it is based on."
4,John Lukacs is a unique intellect,A fascinating 'microscopic history' of larger-than-life personalities - Hitler and Churchill. The book gives the reader a real understanding of these few days where the world was held in the balance. A must-read for anyone more than casually interested in WWII.
4,Much more than five days,"Lukacks' book focuses on the meetings that took place during the last days of May 1940 at the War Cabinet in London. Chamberlain, Halifax and Churchill discussing the convenience of provoking Hittler to offer the UK good peace conditions once France had been defeated. Churchill opposing to any deal of that sort, Halifax favouring it through the Italian Ambassador.The book deeply describes the great political obstacles that Churchill, at that time a weak Prime Minister, had to confront in order to convince his own government to resist Nazi expansion.The book describes also the status of british public opinion at the time.Aditionally this history book is written with clarity and intensity. Critical historical facts told in an absorbing style."
3,Como Se Dice Workbook 7th edition,"Although the workbook itself was in fine condition, there was no answer key at the end of the book like there was in everyone else's workbook in the class."
5,this is as true to life music as ive heard in a long time.,"i cant wait until their next cd comes out, ive already worn out the guilty cd. they also remind me a lot of ""Sons of the Desert"""
1,The series has lost the magnetism of old.,"I have been a fan of The Destroyer series for a long time, but Mr. Murphy has lost control of the essence of the originals ideals. I am sorry to say that I won't be reading the series any more."
1,The hacks have taken over the series.,"This will be the last of the Destroyer books for me. The series, which started out as an intelligent parody of the ""Men's Adventure"" genre, has become the thing it set out to parody.It's apparent the current writers do not understand the underlying premise and are attempting to write the series as straight genre. Worse, they can't even be bothered to read some of the original books to get a feel for the characters. The behavior of Remo and Chiun in this book is so badly distorted from the original intent that they can only be recognized by their names.It was a good ride while it lasted, but it's over. I expect the publisher will let the series die once they realize they've lost their audience and the books aren't selling -- and not a moment too soon."
1,The author is the destroyer.,"To keep it short, until the series regains some appearance of continuity with the others in the series I will stop buying, after 109 I quit. Remo scared of big guys, Chiun barely better than a black belt. Chiun Nice! Please stop buying them and maybe the publisher will get the idea."
3,Light at the end of the tunnel!!,"Since it's baseball season: Whereas #108 didn't even make it to first, this one slid into third!! A Lawyer named Koch-Roche!! Chiun telling Remo to get to the dipshit!! The humor was back and the book was light years better than the last. The areas that I caught the new guy, Alan Philipson, in were: Chiun is not 90 years old, he's over 100, but won't admit to it since he was otherwise occupied when the day occurred; Chiun would not be eating airline food; Smitty was not as ""lemony"" as he should be; Remo is further along as a Master than was depicted in the book; any ""chi"" references should be changed to ""sun source"". This book was not up to the standards of Will Murray, but it certainly blew Mike Newton's version c-l-e-a-r outta the water!!!"
3,"The Destroyer needs a makeover, for sure. .","From the very start, Chiun and Remo turned me off. It was nothing like the Destroyer of old, although it was considerably better than the last one. I like the idea of how animal hormones can affect the human body in such adverse ways, but it wasn't done effectively. I think Mr. Murphy needs to refocus his storylines better, and realize that, although Chiun and Remo have changed over time, they are still assassins, and must act as such. They were both too squeamish in this one."
2,Very thin and hard to apply.,"I prefer using the 2 ply film ,it's alot easier to apply.The film wasn't packaged very well,it had some creases on end of roll where it was bent,that I had to cut off."
1,Not for me,"I had originally gave this tint a good value because it was black magic, but even after a month it's already starting to turn purple I think. I thought matched my old tint but I was wrong. I am going to rip out all my tint and either keep it stock for a while or tint it later. It looks pretty bad I think. Anyways, I recommend just going to Autozone and getting tint there."
1,Sucks,I bought peel and cling from an auto-part store near my house and it is horrible is feels and looks like a pool tarp. After you get the bubbles out it has micro bubbles that are next to impossible to get out. It looks horrible and is very hard to put on. I would not recommend this to anyone to buy.
3,For Small Hands,"Well made, nice looking.. Light weight (not a plus tends to move under your hand when in use) ...Hooks up no problem via usb, no software needed...The layout is just too small for my big meat hooks...I would like color coded keys (I am really a visual person) when I glance down to verify my finger placement...Needs sticky feet, tends to slide around."
3,Needs tactile feedback,"It found it very hard for my fingers to find their ""home."" The non-rectangular key layout means your fingers get lost very easily and you have to look away from your game to find them again. Eventually I ended up taking my pocket knife and scoring hatchmarks into the Shift, A, W, D, and Space keys where my fingers should normally rest to provide tactile confirmation that my fingers are where they should be.There are some aspects of the layout I would change. The large Z, X, C and Space keys could all be split into two keys with no loss of usability. The top half of the Space could be turned into a V key, and the MHN keys could be moved up into the lower half of the ZXC keys where they would be more easily accessible.Otherwise, it does a good job at taking keys that would normally be scattered all over the keyboard and putting them within reach... As long as you're willing to spend the time developing the necessary muscle memory."

4,Gentle biography of difficult music,"This is a very gentle biography of a living composer of music that is not always easy to listen to. It sometimes shakes one's sense of what you expect music to sound like, but this DVD opens one's right hemisphere to listen more creatively to 20th century composers."
1,Kindle edition is defective,"Well, the content of the book is great: I will give 4 stars to it. But the kindle edition I bought is annoying in that it does not display a lot of symbols correctly. For examle belongs to, subset, superset, omega and a host of others are shown as a question mark. You either have to guess the symbol based on the context or refer to another book to find out what it is. Because of this the usability of the book is so low, I have to give a single star. I wish there was another way to publicize this problem without bringing the book ranking down. This is a major flaw in kindle edition that Amazon has to correct urgently."
4,Succinctly presented,One of the better algorithm books I have studied. The content is succinctly presented. It does a good job at handling some complex topics. I like the way the book focuses on techniques for designing algorithms. Manages to bring forth important concepts in algorithm design while keeping the book to a manageable size.
3,Extremely Wordy,"This book is not concise; also the pseudocode syntax used in the book is annoying.If you enjoy reading for the sake of reading then you might enjoy this book.There are better books out there by Knuth, Corman and Aho that cover the same topics as this one."
3,Meh,"Ebook review: Absolutely horrible formatting for the ebook. I ended up returning it and buying an international version because the formatting was so bad. The pages didn't match up with the physical text and it was extremely hard to navigate.Content review: Book wasn't horrible overall, but it definitely could have been much better. Way too wordy for a technical book for my taste, especially the algorithms. Some of the examples, especially network flow, were a bit confusing to understand from the figures provided."
5,THE GREATEST GAME EVER!,"I have always loved the game. And it is easily one of my favorite games on PS2. And there is no better way to show was a game geek I am than listening to the soundtrack. My favorite songs are rather Hikari or Dearly Beloved. The game makes me cry and get all dramatic in emotional parts(Or mysterious quiet parts.) like in the quiet mystical parts of the game such as the part with all of the whispering and mysterious voices, but I'm getting ahead of myself. The point is that the soundtrack shows wonderful classics. I L-O-V-E KINGDOM HEARTS!"
5,Very good for the devoted fan,"You will definitely enjoy this if you are a devoted fan of Kingdom Hearts. Or at least a devoted fan of ""Simple and Clean."" Since it has two only two pop songs, it was met with controversy. Some believe that most of the music should not have been put on there. I believe that a video game CD should include all of the music, and you won't be disappointed with this CD. And actually, a lot of the other music is very nice to listen to. Even if you don't like the classical stuff, both versions of ""Simple and Clean"" will still make you love this CD and I would definitely recommend it."
3,My review of Kingdom Hearts soundtrack,"I partly bought this because of the Simple and Clean songs. I loved them in the game and had to have them. Unfortunatley, when they finally arrived, I was highly disappointed. These songs only come in Japanese versions! No English! But why did Amazon make the Simple and Clean samples in English? I have no idea. But I really did want to hear these songs in English.Overall, I give this product 3 stars because of the other music it provides, thank god its almost all instrumental."
4,Kingdom Hearts fans will love,"I bought this for my nine year old son who is a Kingdom Hearts fan. We have a strict ""no games"" policy during the week and the CD helps him get through. I am not a fan of the game but do appreciate the most of the tracks on the CD. It is nice background music."
5,An Excelent Buy,"Just a heads up. There's ~50 tracks on this CD. at $18 thats around .30 per track. The music on here is worth so much more though. I bought this over 3 years ago & some of the songs are still on my main playlist that I take with me into the car & drive to work with. I'm not just talking about the OP song either. Granted one could get this off a torent for free, but when there is a phenominal game such as this supporting is the gammers job. Unless of course you want the games to be of lower quality."
5,The Best Soundtrack for one of the Greatest disney stories never told,"Kingdom Hearts is undoubtely one of the best stories of Disney.The music, by composer Utada Hikaru is extremely well performed, it's just like you were following the storyline by just listening at the music. However, I strongly recommend to play the videogame first in order to get a better approach to the whole experience.This soundtrack is ideal for Both DISNEY and SQUARE*ENIX fans alike."
4,Enjoyable and familiar,"I bought this item for my eleven-year-old sister as an early Christmas present, and so far it has managed to find itself in every CD player of every room she's been in for the past few days. She just can't get enough of it. The ambience of the music she knows and enjoys playing the game to is something that she continuously thanks me for. I occasionally find myself listening to a few choice tracks with express delight as well. All in all, a very pleasing item for any Kingdom Hearts fan."
3,"""Forgotten""","I love Simon Baker & that's why I purchased this film however, I kept waiting for the movie to get better & it never did. Maybe if I had finished viewing it, but I couldn't seem to get through it. I will attempt to view this movie again but I don't think my opinion will change. Purchase this @ your own risk."
2,Small hints in the dark,"The daughter of Jack Bishop (Simon Baker) is kidnapped. The police look for her. The police look up the usual suspects. Jack Bishop and his wife (who is not the mother of the daughter) look for her. They go to a blind psychic woman who gives them some leads. They go home.Many scenes at night time. It is dark. It is hard to follow what is happening. Very small hints are given. Much too small. The viewer is not intended to really understand. Not until the end, the chocking end. Yawn.If you want to make a movie that has a ""clever twist"" in the end, but not much of interest before the ending, why not make a short movie for 30 minutes? This one is more than one hour too long.What is worse, the clever twist may be clever in a way, but it makes the story completely implausible. Good acting cannot save bad writing."
2,all atmosphere and no thrills,"""Not Forgotten"" probably won't do much to enhance U.S./Mexico relations. Set in Del Rio, Texas, a town located just north of the border, this thriller stars ""The Mentalist""s Simon Baker as a loan officer whose daughter is kidnapped by a bloodthirsty religious cult that, we're told, has achieved widespread notoreity in Mexico.""Not Forgotten"" - which is strong on atmosphere and milieu and weak on anything even remotely resembling suspense - features all the red herrings, false leads and narrative blind alleys that we've come to expect from such films, with each of the characters harboring some deep dark secret from the past that, when it is finally revealed, turns out to be a surprise only to the other characters in the story. For, indeed, when the most likely suspect turns out to be the actual culprit in the end, you know that the screenplay could probably have used a few more runs through the typewriter before going before the cameras."
1,So bad,Love Simon baker. Maybe the worst movie I have ever seen. No plot worth mentioning. He deserves better. Skip this one.
4,Case Studies are for your practice,"I am going to take the RICA in about a month. Many of my friends have already taken the test and said this book was helpful. The book is not intendend to be a sole preparation for the RICA. You need to have a knowledge of terminology and strategies to go along with this book. There are some helpful web sites and books for this purpose as well as any ""Language and Literacy"" courses you may be taking in your credential work. This book is to give you sample case studies such as the ones you will be required to write about on the real test. Keep this in mind when studying."
4,RICA study book,"The test is actually very easy. They are looking for key phrases and the knowledge of how to assess, teach, reassess, reteach... Pay attention to the case study examples, the case study shows that you understand the process and have good observation skills. Just read through the case study examples and one of them wioll be simular to the one they will ask and you will be prepared. I would suggest taking a a 2 hour reveiw to prepare and read the case studies in this book and you will pass."
4,Clean and In Good Condition,"The book came in great condition, no marks on the pages and no folds. If it helps to know, I studied this book and passed the RICAG'Luck!"
3,Works fine,"I used this cement to repair a wet-suit and it works like most other similar contact cement products I've used before: make sure to let it DRY before putting the surfaces together (part of the instructions of any product like this). If not, the seal doesn't work. On the spots where I did do this the seal is good. I haven't repaired any larger tears in the suit, only smaller cracks so can't tell how it performs on bigger repairs. Would probably buy again though at this price ($6 + s/h)."
2,Harry Potter Mountain Troll Figure,"Harry Potter Mt. Troll return, didn't like the restocking fee, probably will not buy form here again. other wise I guess have to live with it"
5,Perfect !,"Very resembling ! Perfect action figure, wonderful details, and I love the broken sink.A must have for all Harry Potter's fans !"
3,"Good, but not great","Although most critics believe Wynton Marsalis's ""Thick in the South"" is the strongest third of his grossly underrated ""Soul Gestures In Southern Blue"" series, I must disagree. The band plays well, but the songs just aren't as gripping as the other ones are in volumes 2 and 3 (Uptown Ruler and Levee Low Moan, respectively).The strongest part of this album is easily the title track. Wynton wastes no time busting into his high-octane solo, which is followed by an equally intense performance by Joe Henderson. The original version of ""So This Is Jazz, Huh?"" is also a part of this album, but it pales in comparison to the second version on ""Levee Low Moan"".Overall, with the exception of the title track, this is only a lukewarm album. If the title track did not exist, then I would not recommend it."
4,An excellent book,"What I really liked about this book is that it is both a history of science, and an explanation of scientific thinking. By following the thread of scientific thought from the beginning until now really makes all the pieces fit together.I occasionally like to read books about real science for the lay person, and many modern theories such as relativity and quantum mechanics are not very intuitive and seem pretty weird. But after reading about the historical context in which those theories were derived, they suddenly make much more sense. You understand the strange observational data that lead to the heories, and the questions that they answer."
2,Read carefully,"Read a wonderful review of this book and then ordered it. Not my cup of tea, but the review was great!"
5,Great prepared food for Hermit Crabs,"It's the only prepared food my Hermit Crabs love. JurassiDiet, in addition to fresh food, keeps them very HAPPY, active, and healthy!"
1,Useless!,"This book is useless! There are countless references to interesting archived documents in the text, but not a single picture or facsimile of any such document. Also, when referring to broken ciphers etc., an explanation and/or picture of such a system would have helped a lot, but -alas - nothing of the sort!"
2,A waste of the art,"First of all let me tell you that this book could be written in 100 pages less, taking that little part away, how could ten art experts buy a fake copy of a paint. They don't study how to recognize a fake?The book has too many stories and everybody make wrong things and they go against all the laws and nobody does nothing, that is unreal.S P O I L E R: don't read the next text unless you already read the bookHow can anybody steal one million dollars and no one does nothing? Or even worse, they forgive the thieves just for the value of the real paints. That is pathetic."
3,Mediocre Follett is still better than a lot of writing,"This book is dated, and the plot took a while to sink in for me. However, once I got into the swing of things, I enjoyed this book very much.Because the amount of artwork by any given artist is finite, discovering that there may be an undiscovered work by a famous artist is a huge discovery in the art world. When an art student studying abroad hears that not all of Modigliani's works are available, she delightedly decides to find the one that was reputedly hidden during the War.The many twists of the plot are difficult to follow until they tie together at the end of the book. The plots do fit nicely! but it is confusing to follow throughout the body of the book.This is not Ken Follett's best work. However, for an early work, it's quite good; furthermore, it's a lot better than a lot of the drek that some authors are trying to pass off as literature."
2,An early Follett novel only most ardent fans will moderately enjoy,"There's not much to say in reviewing the Modigliani Scandal, an early Follett novel published before he hit it big with the World War II thriller ""Eye of the Needle."" In a forward for the version I read, Follett acknowledges that this little story about art dealers, artists and thieves in London doesn't have much depth. Still, it is fun to read and to see traces of the greatness that is to come. There really aren't any main characters, just a bunch of story lines that all merge together in the end. The plot concerns the chase for a rare painting by a famous Italian artist, Modigliani. The plot also follows a Lucian Black as he tries to open his own art gallery. The book is short and easy to read, and if you're a Follett fan, I recommend you read this, but I don't think I'd recommend that you pay money for it. It's just not that good of a book."
3,It is what it is...,"an early written story by a future great storyteller!Ok, so it's not Triple of Jackdaws, but it's worth reading nonetheless.Pick up a copy and look for glimpses of brilliance, that's the way I approached it! I found a few, but not many...see for yourself, you might be surprised!"
3,Interesting,"Not as exciting as his books on warsNice weaving of characters no murders and learned new information on the art world buyers, galleries & artistsSurprise ending"
3,"Wish I could rate this higher, but ...","To be honest, I haven't read the entire book. What I've read of it so far seems to be pretty good. At least it has captured my reading attention. The problem I *DO* have with this book is the formatting for Kindle. It is horrible to say the least; to the point where it is quite distracting. It appears that they converted from a printed book, ran it through a spell checker and never looked at the final file. Lead quote marks are backward, as are apostrophes, contractions break across two lines. Nit-picks, I know. But really, they could have at least looked at the final product before releasing it."
4,Good story.,Another good book by Ken Follet. I must have missed it when it first came out. Almost any book by Ken Follet if worth reading.
2,Not his Best,"This book , although entertaining , is not characteristic of some of Folletts' later works . It sort of plods along to the finish line."
2,A letdown,Not one of Follet's best. It was a departure from his normal story line and being one of his earlier works may have been why it was less than exciting for me to read. Many characters pop in and out of the narrative requiring repeated flip back of pages to refresh my memory and using Kindle made it tougher.
2,Modigliani Scandal is dissappointing,"I have read (and enjoyed) every Ken Follett book available to date, and this is the only one that has truly dissappointed me. I couldn't care less about the characters or the plot, and I found the book actually boring. I just can't honestly recommend this book, even to Ken Follett fans such as myself.Ken Follett is still my favorite author and I am looking forward to his next release in September."
3,Ken Follett - The Modigliani Scandal,"It is obviously an early work, still, you feel the potential of the writer. However, if you read the book after your have read the latest Follett novels, you are dissapointed. So, I would not recommend it among the first novels to be read by a Follett novice."
3,Good Read,"I read this book at the end of the spring semester. I'm not very familiar with Follet's work but I generally liked the book. It was an easy read and a great way to relax. Though it is a good easy read, I probably won't read it again though."
5,Delightful!,"A delightful little mystery, written when he was still an unknown, and I think originally published under some other name? Of course you cannot compare this little book (a short one) with the best of the best sellers today, but you must remember it was written many years ago. Put yourself in 1986 or whenever this was written when you read it.Fans of Ken Follett must get this book. I think it's even better than some of the books written right after he got famous. I'm glad that this book was reprinted."
3,A fast read - but not really worth searching out a copy,"I read this book based on Amazon's Book Matcher recomendations. It was ok, and I read it fairly quickly (less than a week), but it is definitely not as good as his more recent works. I wouldn't go searching for a copy of this book (borrow it from the library, if you feel that you must read it)."
3,Modigliani Scandal,It was an easy read and enjoyable; not Ken Follett's best work but an enjoyable way to pass the time I would still recommend it.
2,Disappointing,This ring looks much better in the photographs than in person. Colors are dull and dirty and in less than 2 months the majority of the sliver had worn off leaving a dull and dingy band. The only decent thing I can say is that it arrived promptly.
5,I hate scraping ice,I have had one of these for probably 10 years and it has saved me from scraping ice many times. It still works very well but it's getting worn around the edges so I am ordering a couple more. I would hate to be without it.
4,it works,"This product work but the suction doesn't work. Regardless, just use the door to hold it down."
3,Don't watch for the plot.,"I say that because to be honest, it's a cliche, by the numbers good vs evil story and there's holes you can drive a Mack Truck through. The makers tried very hard to make her an anti hero and they only sort of suceeded.That said, watch it because Saki kicks ass and uses a yo-yo for a weapon. There are some wonderful fight scenes and she uses the yo-yo to great effect. Watch it for those. Heck, make a drinking game out of it.I should also add that in the end, when she starts tearing up the bad guy's organization single handed, is when the animation comes into it's own."
5,How Does he do it!?,"Rene Clausen has a gift. He has a seemingly never-ending pallet with which to paint some of the most stunningly colored arrangements I have ever heard. ""Tonight, Eternity Alone"" melts me. It's stunning - as is most every song this man endeavors to write. My only complaint is that there seems to be no recording available of his stunning piece, ""Whispers of Heavenly Death"". Finding that would mark the end of my search for compositional perfection."
5,"Lovely, lovely","Beautiful choral music beautifully performed. Clausen has a gift for lush harmonies, and knows how to use rhythm in subtle but surprising ways."
5,Every couple involved in a relationship should own a copy,"If you want to find out why you make the statement"" he/she is driving me crazy"", then read this book and you will have the understanding necessary to finally figure out what is really going on. It truly is an amazing book and gives you what you need to once and for all put a stop to some of the crazy-making going on in your relationship. A must reading for everyone, not just someone in a relationship. It helps you to understand why you do the things you do."
4,Don't stop! Read it.,"This is the best self-help book I've ever read. It's written in the language of the 70's, but it's got the right ideas. My husband found it and actually read it before giving it to me. Our marriage was shaky at the time, but once I read it it too we learned to talk to each other in a meaningful way, saying what we mean without yelling or pushing each others' buttons. I always say it's the book that saved our marriage. It doesn't have to be spouses who will benefit from reading this old saw, it could be parents and kids, boyfriends and girlfriends, or even just one person dealing with the world.I have bought this book over and over from Amazon and given it to each of my children and many friends over the years."
5,You are driving me crazy,"Very helpful insite as to why couples have the arguments, and you just can't figure out why you lost your temper when you did. It goes into great detail step by step on how to stop arguing about the wrong thing, and to get the 'right' argument put back in the center of attention."
3,Not that impressed,"I was really disappointed with this album, infact, I would really like to send it back and get something different if I could. While it was playing my husband said, ""What in the world do you have playing on the stereo, groan......."
2,"Taste good, but didn't work for me","I don't see how these are different from a ""normal"" lollipop. They tasted good, but they didn't really keep my nausea away."
1,Inside will poke your cats eyes out!!!,"I bought the large size woven cat carrier. The outside is great...but the inside is a nightmare!!! Edges are sticking out all over, just try putting your precious cat inside and she or he may lose an eye. So very disappointed it looked great. On top of that there is a restocking fee plus all the shipping to and from. Am so mad at how they take advantge of their customers. Its going back!"
1,Rip Off. Only a few pages long.,"Bought this on a whim for my son as DK is usually a great book brand. However, for $6.99 this book is hugely over valued. It is only a few pages long. Don't buy it. Wish I could return it but it will cost half the value of the book to do so.I'll chalk it up to experience and stop acting on my whims!"
3,Somewhat mediochre for Victorian erotica ..,"Blance, our French heroine, at the age of 19 and a brief but sexually unfullfilling marriage decides to leave her husband (or, I guess her husband left her) and find her way alone.Alhnough she considers being a nanny, no good cause she has no recommendations and the men of the family would probably be fodder for her sexual appetites; the being a secretary .. no good cause she doesn't type or even have the money to buy a typewriter ... then how about aspiring starlet ... YUP thats the ticket ..She moves in with a lady that has a seamstress shoppe and soon finds out that they make more than dresses in this shopppe ... Matter of fact it's a beutifull cover for wealthy women to buy clothes AND have clandestine sex ... WOW..."
5,"Teachers' ""Book of Lists"" Invaluable","This large, soft-back book is one of the most valuable items any teacher of Reading or ESL can have! It contains opposites, irregular verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, sounds of letter combinations, idioms, sentence builders, and anything else you might need. I had used it for many years teaching primary children and non-English-speaking adults. When I retired I passed my book on to a teacher friend. Later I volunteered to tutor ESL students and found that I needed my book again. Thanks to Amazon, I'm back in the classroom with my trusty ""Reading Teacher's Book of Lists"" by Edward Fry!"
4,Great gift for teacher ed students,A useful resource for pre-service teachers to aid them in lesson planning and work samples for student teaching; a book they will refer to often as they enter their teaching careers.
5,must-have for the powerpuff fan!,"the episodes are hilarious and are some of my favorites, so i had to buy this. there are lots of cute tid-bits to watch and even the behind the scenes of the making of apples in the sky was nice to watch! not to mention the mojo and mayor commentaries (which are a nice addition but as a teen, i didn't find them very funny.. ^^;) and when you've watched everything, watch all the episodes in spanish/french for kicks! hehe. but i'm only comparing this to the only other ppg DVD i bought which was the first one, so this was a big improvement."
4,multiple use tape,"Does what it is supposed to for temporary posters etc. Not the cheapest way, but convenient and quick with the dispenser. Tape is clear so if you miss a corner it won't show. Comes off hard surfaces easily without leaving residue. Removal from paper surfaces may cause damage depending on how dense the paper is and how long it has been on."
4,interesting tape,"It's almost like regular two sided tape, but thicker and less sticky. The plastic part feels more thick and rubbery than standard scotch tape and it seems to conform to bumpy surfaces better. It doesn't seem as sticky - but that's a good thing because it's supposed to peel off the wall without leaving adhesive and marks.Over all, it does a decent job. No idea (yet) how long it will hold things aloft. A 1"" piece has been holding a tin of starbucks gum on a cabinet door for a few days. No drama.On the other hand ... The roll does have a few warnings on the back:""Note: Removes cleanly from walls. May damage poster upon removal. Not recommended for use on wallpaper, delicate surfaces or walls painted with flat paint.""My intuition is that this stuff would be great for beiber type posters because it minimizes damage to the wall and the posters will be replaced with something else in a year or two."
1,Only good for paper and tiny posters,"This stuff is useless for posters. I've tried to hang up four standard weight 24"" x 36"" posters with in the last several days, and they've all fallen down within a few hours. If you can find 3M's ""black removable mounting tape"" anywhere, buy that instead. Unfortunately 3M seems to have discontinued it, so back to putting holes in my walls or using packing tape I guess."
2,removable mounting tape,"Dont purchase this if you are looking for something to hang posters, it wont hold up a poster. The only thing that it held was paper."
3,okay for the price,Its my first time using this tape. its okay. It worked to tape some stuff on my wall but not others.I will try with photos
2,"Removable yes, gentle no","I found that this poster tapes works well on glossy surface, but on flat painted surface, it can take off some of the paint. And depending upon the heat conditions your item has been in, it can take some paper with it when using paper-paper contact. As long as you realize this possibility and exercise some caution it should be ok, but it is not as ""removable"" as a Post-it, since it does need to hold up some more weight."
5,Sticky,"I got this so I could hold stuff to my plaster walls. Needless to say, many other things (nails for instance) don't really work. This was able to hold up posters and some light poster board.Great product."
3,Works good for some things,"I'm always looking for new tape to be able to hold my posters or things to my wall. I tried the poster tape on a heavier poster and on a bumpy wall and unfortunately, the poster fall off in day. So I didn't have success with that. But the tape does work well in holding light items like a page from a coloring book, tablet paper, greeting cards, sticky notes, etc. I would just not recommend it for full-length posters or posters that you plan on keeping for a long period of time."
4,WORKS AS ADVERTISED,"This tape lived up to its advertising. We have used it on the back of posters, small picture frames and photos and placed them on newly painted walls. I worried about it leaving a sticky residue or peeling paint from the wall once removed but no problems were noted when removing them from the wall.If it's so great why only four stars? I had a problem with removing the paper backing from this double sided tape. In fact, it took several minutes to remove the paper and sometimes required another strip to be used since the first one would end up ruined while attempting to remove the paper. Still, the beauty of using a tape that allows you to stick things up and remove them without leaving any residue can be worth the extra effort.This tape will not hold up heavy items but it works like a dream on posters, photos and any other light weighted items if you can get the paper backing off cleanly."
3,Limited use,"This a nice idea but did not really stand up to the test. I hang up a lot of posters in my office and this tape could only handle a few of the smaller, lighter ones. Any larger posters did not stay up. It also need smooth surfaces."
5,"Great product, but here's my helpful hint:","I tried it out by using a one-inch piece to ""hang up"" a medium-sized calendar on a paneled wall. It holds it up, and I was able to take it off and move it to another location without any marks on the wall.One bit of advice: I'm over sixty and my fingers don't have the manual dexterity I did when I was younger. Thus, at first I had a little trouble getting the tape off its paper backing, after I'd torn off a piece of the proper length. Here's the hint: I found that if you start removing the tape from its paper backing, BEFORE you tear it all the way off from the roll, that will help get the tape off its backing and ready for action. It kinda gives you an extra hand for holding the tape while pulling off the paper backing."
4,Underappreciated gems,"The Cryan Shames were one of numerous 1960s groups that had a strong regional following (Chicago, in this case) but never managed to break out on the national scene. Too bad, because the Shames had some fine songs and arrangements and excellent harmony vocals that rival the Association, the Harper's Bizarre, and the like. ""Sugar and Spice"" and ""It Could Be We're in Love"" were regional chart-toppers and moderate national hits, but there are several other worthy songs here. Highly recommended."
4,"Nearly, but Not Quite Perfect","Firstly, many of the other reviews here have errors. Some of them are reviews of the Cryan' Shames' first album, which this CD is not. This CD is a compilation of most of their hits and best songs. I really like this CD, but, I can't give it 5 stars because of one glaring error in this compilation. Included in this compilation is an 'unreleased single version' of "" Mr. Unreliable"". The problem with this is that ""Mr. Unreliable"" WAS released as a single and was a Top Ten hit on WLS. The version here is not that recording, nor is it the slower album version. If that single hit had been included, this CD would have earned 5 stars. Since it isn't, no matter how good the sound is here, I can only giive it 4 stars. It's still worth buying, as a good overview of this classic Chicago rock band, if as nothing else, but, it could have been perfect."
1,sugar and spice,"this album by the cryan' shames, is incomplete, and rates a zero as the song young girl, is missing which is one of the best songs done by the cryan' shames,"
5,Sanding belts,"A hard to find size - thank you Amazon. Good quality as always, from 3M. This is for a small belt sander, which is a fantastic size, for interior jobs. The sander is a Black & Decker, but their dealers don't carry this size belt any longer."
4,old type DIY tool sanding belts,"hard to find these sized belts anymore. OSH used to carry them, but alas, no longer. Rather than buy a new sander, I found these on Amazon and ordered a few extras. One day I'll need to move to the newer sized belt sanders, but not as long as Amazon has these on hand. Nice!"
5,Excellent,Fast delivery. Durable and cute for a bathroom. Easily installed. Affordable price. Sure to get a few comments. Matches my bathroom perfectly.
1,What the???,"Simon Green's Deathstalker series was one of the best I have ever read, untill this book came out. Plots that took several hundred pages to set up were resolved in the blink of an eye. It seemed like that Green set out to finish the series on a long weekend. What a total waste of money."
5,"The End of the Series, Or Is It?","There's hardly a bigger problem to imagine the hero having to face than the very existence of the galaxy itself. But that's the problem that Owen Deathstalker has to face in this the conclusion to Simon Green's Deathstalker series. I make this the eighth book in the Deathstalker series. It promises to be the last. All the story lines are wrapped up in a tidy little bundle. There will be no more.But then again, Deathstalker Destiny was billed as the Fifth and Last Part of the Life and Times of Owen Deathstalker. I guess the public just wouldn't let Mr. Green end it so easily.As with all the series, this book is filled with swash buckling action, covers a bunch of territory (as well as a lot of time as Owen goes back a couple of hundred years), and you know that good has to triumph over evil.If you are new to the Deathstalker series, you're in for a real treat."
4,Satisfying,Coda is a satisfying ending to a long and enjoyable space opera. As in all of the Deathstalker books there is copious amounts of action and bloodletting that is so violent it is almost comedic.This is light space opera and action at its best.
1,The unfortunate conclusion,"I have read the entire series... and while I have been used the occasional bad bit of writing and plot tie ups in the series ( usually only in sections of a book ) I was very saddened to see that almost the entire book was cliched and ( I really hate to say this ) badly written. Dialogue between characters was weak almost as if I was reading a rough draft. And it appeared that the writer was just trying to finish the book with as few loose ends as possible.I almost really hope that Mr. Green did not write this book but someone else finished it for him, it would explain many of the amauterish mistakes I would catch.Simon R. Green's books are among my many favorite's. I still reread the first Deathstalker book and Blue Moon Rising. The Hawk and Fisher series is excellent light reading. I am just sad to see such a conclusion to a story that swept me up in its mythos and took me along for a ride."
1,This book just plain reeked.,"I am sorry I bought it. This book was horrible, from beginning to end. It was nothing more then a rehash of the first books and provided nothing original at all. I am embarrassed to even claim to have read it. I hope Mr. Green, who has written some very fine pieces of science fiction, goes back to the drawing board and figures out what to do with his career. If no one will buy any of his books unless the word, ""Deathstalker"" is in the title, then I feel for him, because he is a much better author then he let on in this book or the two that proceeded it."
2,Wok ring doesn't work well on our gas stove.,Wok ring doesn't allow an even air flow so the gas flame from our stove puts the flame all in one area of the wok and this area is not at the bottom of the Wok! Have tried it upside down also and it did not help. Not sure if is the size of our stove grates or the wok ring. On a level surface the wok ring does hold the wok until it cools down at least.
4,does the job,works like it says. no issues found. this review requires thirteen more words .....so I I I try..lol ha ha
3,I don't like it at all.,This wok ring is not good as I think.I think I have no need to use it when I cook.
1,Wok ring,"Bought and will return this product , not strong, too small , not well made , not a good size."
2,Useless on a basic gas range,"I got this gas ring to bring my wok closer to the heat of my gas stove. After removing my cast iron grate over the heat source, the ring basically choked the heat, and despite the holes, did little to feed the air intake to the gas. For me, this was a useless buy"
2,Not so universal,"The wok or this just didn't work together. Suggest a wok with a companion ring instead. Can't find just wok rings out there as most have either flat bottoms or built-in rings. So, don't recommend going this way."
3,Wok Ring Review,"The wok ring is OK for a 14 inch or smaller wok. Even though it was recommended for my 16 inch wok, it is too small and as a result, the wok bowl sits too high over my gas flame. My wok actually works better without the wok ring. If you have a smaller wok, I believe the bowl of the wok would be closer to the flames."
2,Wok Ring,"This product is OK, but wished I had put more thought in it before buying.Needs to be a whole set, not sold individually!"
5,what you pay for,"there's really no way to go wrong with producing a simply metal ring, exactly what I expected so I'm happy"
1,Cheap,"This thing is very cheap. After just one use the ""aluminum"" coating is flaking off and burning.I wouldn't buy this again."
2,white color,"The selection shows (1) white and (2) mixed colors, yet at check out it states that there are no guarantees regarding the colors. I wanted all white and was very disappointed when I received mixed colors. The all white needs to be removed as a customer choice."
2,Not what was ordered,"I bought here because it is impossible to find the size and style that I prefer in stock at local stores. I had ordered the neutral, black and white package and received pinks and greens. The size and style were correct at least and no one will be seeing them so I decided to just keep them instead of going through the trouble for different colors."
2,Didn't Receive What I Ordered,"Ended up having to return this because I ended up getting a mixed batch (colorful) of underwear, when I wanted a black and white set. Just beware.However, if you don't mind, the product, from not opening it up, still appeared to be good quality and new. Size was accurate according to package."
4,great price,"Given the short life of underwear, I believe buying discount packages like this is the way to go. Then, when the machine destroys them, throwing them out and replacing them isn't so painful."
2,Not good quality,"I know these bikinis are cheap, but the fabric is so thin that is almost see through. The size didn't work for me either, were too big. I couldn't use them. I give them 2 stars only because the color and the shape were right."
5,I like,"I bought this brand because I know it's good. I have no problem with them. I just found them expensive compare to walmart, I can get the for $7. So ext time that's where I will be going."
5,"Fit is good, very soft, neutral color palette","The bikini panties are well done. Smooth seams where the elastic meets the cotton, the fit is correct and I really like the colors. Soft browns, blacks etc. One thing in particular is that these are very soft - a blessing in 100 degree plus temperatures! I would buy these again."
1,Not as advertized,"I ordered white underwear as shown and as described, but they sent multicolored and patterned assorted underwear instead so I had to return it. Too bad. I can't find white anywhere."
2,Read the Fine Print,I didn't read the fine print so thought that I was buying all white undies as the package shows instead of 2 white and 4 printed/colored pairs that the package actually contained. I was disparate for undies so I will make do with the four nonwhite pairs but will look more closer before buying next time!
1,Not about shark attacks as title suggests,"If you're looking for information about shark attacks, you will be disappointed.This book contains a series of essay about sharks and diving, but none of them recount actual shark attacks.If shark attacks are what you're looking for, try:Shark Attacks: Their Causes and AvoidanceIn Harm's Way: The Sinking of the U.S.S. Indianapolis and the Extraordinary Story of Its SurvivorsTwelve Days of Terror: A Definitive Investigation of the 1916 New Jersey Shark Attacks"
4,use your imagination!,"This oil was just what I had hoped. It is light, with a great flavor of walnut. Let your imagination run wild - salad dressing, add to veggies, anything!"
5,Great transaction,"The Bluray arrived withing a few days of placing the order, way before the estimated arrival date. Happy daughter!"
3,An entertaining story with Disney's uneven life lessons.,"This movie fills its role as a cute movie with feel-good sentiments quite well, though it could have steered clear of a few common missteps.Pros:1. Teaches that we should spend time with our children, and listen to them, no matter what the subject.2. Promotes teamwork, friendship, and loyalty.3. It has incredible animation, hilarious situations, and is fun to watch.Cons:1. Promulgates a fallacy common in video fiction: science or scientists are unequivocally cruel and uncaring...perhaps even maniacal.2. Disseminates yet another fallacy common in our culture: belief (in anything) is always preferable and morally superior to honest inquiry.What would be nice to see is a movie of this nature that promotes the fun of mythology, without the unnecessary attempt to burden us with the insistence that we must believe the mythology. In other words, present the story -- don't preach it."
3,Entertaining and enjoyable,"My four youngest children said this about the movie...""It was funny.""""I liked it.""They described it as ""enjoyable"" and ""entertaining"" and ""humorous.""My pre-teen daughters said that they didn't like how the film made the fairies responsible for the seasons and other things that God has created.The film definitely skews toward a female audience. It's innocent entertainment and fun for young girls especially. It's nice to take a well-loved character like Tinker Bell and provide some additional stories for her."
4,"Sweet movie, for the most part","The overall story is as described by Amazon. The animation is very nice. The sound is fine. My 5-year-old has watched it a few times and the 10-year-old only once. I watched most of it, but it is not as entertaining for adults as some of the other Disney pictures. Both of my children are girls, and I would not recommend this to a non-fairy lover. It is a cute story, with the preoccupied father as my only complaint--this is one stereotype I wish we could overcome: Some dads (maybe even most) are involved with their children more than with themselves. It is a movie worth watching for the younger female set, though it does not have the ""I want to see it again"" factor from my girls that I have seen in movies like ""Mulan"" or ""Sleeping Beauty."""
4,Gotta Love Tink!,Well done movie that my girls love and I do not mind watching! The animation just keeps getting better and it is fun to see the characters develop as the series continues.
5,great movie,I rented this movie twice for my daughters through Amazon. It is a wonderful cartoon to watch. Tinkerbell fans will not be disappointed.
5,Tinker Bell and the Great Rescue,My kids love it but Michelle love it more because she got to play Tinker Bell in school. Thank You.
3,Good For Little Girls?,"I'll start off by saying I am actually a Disney fan. Liked their old classic animation and am a big fan of their ""Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Lion King,"" era. Also like suspending my skepticism and scorn for all the negative Disney reality and taking someone who has never been to their theme park before, especially children and seeing their eyes grow to the size of pie pans.That said, this Tinker Bell movie does not have the draw or magic of a classic Disney reconversion of a fairy tale or even one of the more modern fairy tales or original Pixar stories of recent years.I'd have trouble showing this to any young male children and can only picture a very young girl who really like the character of Tinker Bell as being interested in watching the film. It is just one of those DVD's you would rent and have your kids watch once and be thankful you did not buy it, since it would sit on the shelf and never be watched more than once."
5,Great for the whole family.,"It's hard to be sure what's 'safe viewing' for a 2 year old: When my granddaughter was scared by ""Monsters Inc"", I learned a lesson: When in doubt, err toward cuddly, safe, etc. Unfortunately, that's stuff I can barely stay awake through. Tinker Bell's a great middle ground; There's suspense & danger for the fairies, but nothing that scares the kid, (the 'big scare' is a 10 year old girl), & enough content that I'm needed to interact with explanations, rather than glue them to the screen & put me to sleep. A very pretty film."
4,Wonderful,"My 2.5 year old can't get enough of it. Great music, great story, great lessons, great animation. Doesn't have villons dying at the end or other ultra scary scenes for us to fast forward. A winner in our house!"
5,It's Tinkering! What's not to like?,"Three granddaughters! How could I not have the complete set? Quite enjoyable series of movies. A bit of adventure, a lot of beauty, a bunch of creativity. Does Amazon sell pixie dust?"
5,Loved it,My Grandaughter loves watching all types of videos and this one was very cute. Nice to see fun childrens videos.
5,Tinker bell and the Great Fairy Rescue,I bought this for my granddaughter who loves all the Tinker Bell movies and always wants me to watch them with her. I ordered this and received it promptly and it was in excellent condition. I enjoyed snuggling in front of the TV with my granddaughter and watching it together. Thanks for the great time and memory.
2,Much slower compared to its predecessors.,My daughter loved the first Tinkerbell film and also enjoys the second one (though not as much). The third film was a miss. It moved way too slow. Was way too dialogue heavy and seemed to waste time explaining things to the audience that were reviewed in the previous films. The biggest surprise was the fact that while Vidia's character shows some growth (coping to getting Tinkerbell stuck in the toy house)while Tinkerbell's character seems the same brash character from the previous films. The film simply spent too much time explaining things when it should have been doing things. I'm hoping the next film reverses this trend.
3,Cute,My daughter asked for this for Christmas which was several months ago. I don't think she watched it as much as some of her other movies.
3,good stuff,"Well, it's Disney and it's a blu-ray. Good story for little kids although my daughter doesn't seem as captivated with Tinkerbell and the fairies as much now (maybe because now she's into the Princesses more). Blu-ray quality is great, but of course, so are other CG movies like this."
5,Good stuff,My adugher enjoyed it very much. Fast delievery and good quality. I also enjoyed watching it together with my daughter.
3,Daughter liked it,"My daughter (who is 9) enjoyed this movie. My son (11) could barely sit through it;) Myself, I thought it was a cute movie. It showed us that as parents, we often dismiss what our children are trying to tell us because are so wrapped up in ""our"" business. I would recommend this movie to families with young girls (9 and under). We'll probably pass it along to our neighbor with a 5 year old."
4,"Another hook for the TinkerBell, fairy fans","My daughter has gone through the TinkerBell phase, and particularly likes it because one fairy looks like her, instead of it just being a story of the blond haired TinkerBell. This movie was enjoyable to watch, certainly more so for kids. As with the first TinkerBell movie, I found my mind wandering and don't find these fairy stories as uplifting or adventurous like some of the other Disney movies, i.e. Mulan, Pocahantas, Aristocats, Toy Story... The storyline isn't that much of a new thing, a sort of absent minded parent when it comes to their kids, but of course, it all works out in the end.The animation is impressive, it is colorful and cheery, but just don't expect a very thought provoking movie. If your child is a big fairy fan, then you can't go wrong, but if not, the movie might miss its mark. Still, its replay value is quite limited."
5,Tinkerbell Movie,This is a really cute movie! I received my order quickly and it was in excellent condition when I got it. It made a great stocking stuffer!
5,Great! Better than v1!,"Of compilations 1 and 2, this one is definitely the one to get! Much more go-go-ish and fun and goofy. Volume 1 is good, but this one is so much better."
2,Low temperature failure,"I have been using X10 systems for 15 years now, and they have all worked perfectly -- except this one. Every winter it stops working. Last year I went through all sorts of experiments trying to get it to work. I replaced it, and the replacement shows the same problem. The problems start around 40F. The unit is installed in the attic, which can easily get below freezing. The specifications state that it is good down to 0F but this is definitely not the case. I'm still not sure how to fix the problem."
1,Don't bother getting an Apollo,"This printer, really an HP, is terrible! It cannot print envelopes at all and regularly jams. I think HP is not the way to go anymore, as their quaility has deteriorated over the years."
1,NO.....JUST NO!,"This is the WORST printer I have EVER owned. If you are considering buying it...you're better off stabbing yourself in the eye. It is NEVER reliable and RARELY works properly. It has to be THE shoddiest printer ever made. Honestly, I only gave it one star because I had no other choice."
2,The Art and Practice of Low Vision,"This book is a BASIC book for optometrists who want to dabble in low vision. It is not for the low vision specialist! I found a lot of the information to be useful, but there are better books available."
2,NOT FUN,"This book is based in the winter, it has sooo much snow to color that my niece's white crayon was almost gone. She didn't like it because barbie (or ken) appear in the HOLE page, too big and she didn't have fun coloring her BIG hair of her BIG face.. it was not fun she prefers to color details and landscapes.. i dont know. but she didnt like it. didnt even finish it"
4,Loyalty Soufflet,"Surrender the Pink was as enjoyable a read as Postcards from the Edge. Fisher does a good job of letting her characters age and mature although all of them remain somewhat troubled. I found Surrender the Pink an intriguing follow up to Bachelor Girl, a cultural history of the single working woman. Dinah, the protagonist, is a classic example of the conflicted single gal. She loves her job, likes sleeping alone and yet wants to married and maybe have a baby. She toys with trying to get back together with an ex but ultimately comes to her senses. The book, save for the tacked on epilogue, ends with Dinah deciding to stay single. The epilogue choses to save her from spinsterhood, although I'm not sure I like her choice of man. With the epilogue in place, I am reminded of the film Something's Got to Give and I'm thinking of the daughter in the film as being akin to Dinah."
1,Problems about people you don't really like.,"Sometimes a book is written about people you just don't learn to care about. ""Surrender the Pink"" is a prime example of this. I never developed an affection for these characters, I just never learned to care about their personal problems. They just came across as shallow, whiny people.Some of the scenes, including being trapped in a closet in your ex-husband's house, were very weak and lacked originality. All in all, just not that much fun."
1,What's so funny?,"This book is sick! I'm not sure how I endured 67+ pages when I didn't like it from the first page. The ""plus"" is because I flipped through it after page 67 to see if I could find any reason why this book had such rave reviews. I could not find anything.Not only could I not find anything to laugh about, but I couldn't even find anything to smile about.Is there a ""story"" in here somewhere? If so, it sure wasn't in the pages I read. I'm glad I wasted no more precious reading time on this book. It's in the ""give away"" stack, but could be in the garbage."
2,Not Much in Here You Probably Didn't Already Know,"I was really disappointed in this one. I was expecting something original and insightful. Instead of revealing some kind of insider knowledge, it was just a re-hash of the basics- stance, grip, stroke, reading greens, equipment, practicing, etc. No different than what you'll find in any basic instruction on putting, and not nearly as comprehensive or intelligent as Dave Stockton's book. In fact, you can get through it about an hour.The only interesting part was the introduction, which gave a brief biographical account of George Low. His life seems to have been a lot more novel than this book is."
3,chocolatiere review,"This product was made cheaply. I love the fact that they sent the molds with it, however I've used this product 3 times so far and already the handle is loose on the pot and threatening to fall off. It melts the chocolate just fine but for the money spent I fear I'll be looking for a better made replacement before long."
2,Brickhouse Needed More of a Foundation,"I read the book ""Homecourt Advantage"" and enjoyed it, so I eagerly purchased ""Brickhouse"" and was disappointed. Usually when a book is well written, I can breeze through reading it with no difficulties. However, it took me forever to get through this book! The characters did not hold my interest and the plot was uninteresting and felt a bit contrived. Sorry, but I expected so much more."
2,My review,"I live in Bucks County. I have read this book. It seems the author has foucus on his point: to tell ghost stories. However, he seems to focus on UPPER BUCKS COUNTY. I have found no LOCAL stories that I can relate to. Also, the book focuses on Bed and Breakfasts Inns, rather than ANY place. If you love a good creep, then this book is for you."
1,Not Good,"The book Books County Ghost stories, is just poorly written. The writing was in the style of a bad tv script, leaving the reader with chapter endings to this extent ""they say the ghosts are all gone...but are they?. Poorly written and gave no real history to the sites but rather tried to scare you with spooky words and bad cliffhangers"
5,Sterling Silver & Pearl Anklet,"This anklet is absolutely beautiful and prettier in person! I ordered it for my best friend's daughter's wedding, and she loves it! Everything about it is absolutely perfect! A gorgeous piece!"
1,Arrived Damaged,Shipped via UPS. Several parts were damaged and will require replacement including the regulator and discharge tube. Campbell Hausfeld told me to deal with Amazon and/or UPS. I just ordered the parts instead of going through that hastle. So since I have to buy some parts to use this thing I cannot recommend ordering this through Amazon.
2,Disappointing and what really is the message?,"Any blurb that says ""humorous"" has to be treated with caution. This book is mildly clever in places but one is left wondering what really is the 'takeaway'. Yes we all know that the right person is needed in the right job but how profound is that as a business lesson. Even ""Who moved my cheese?"" had more to offer than this somewhat trite attempt at a business parable. Give me books like ""The obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive"" and ""Death by Meeting"" any day."
2,Don't Try So Hard,"The overall premise of this book is that much of management has to do with common sense, and that one should avoid being duped by the management fad of the day. The overarching message is that we should emphasize people's strengths by putting them in positions where they can utilize them best. Makes sense, right?Unfortunately, this fable tries so very hard to be funny that it detracts from the simple message. In fact, the premise becomes so exaggerated in order to set up the animal puns and humor that its validity is actually called into question. Post parable, a small dose of balance is finally restored.Nick McCormick - Author, Lead Well and Prosper: 15 Successful Strategies for Becoming a Good Manager"
4,"Fun, but lacking profundity. . .",I found this book a lot of fun--reminded me of say Charlott's web. (Except with a weird business twist) It contains quite a bit of VERY basic information--explains a lot of buzzwords in a humorous way and by doing so is more honest about management by fad than most of the books I've read.For someone just learning about business this wouldn't be a bad book just to pick up some of the vocab and develop a healthy cynicism of business fads. I personally didn't learn anything new. MBAs can feel free to skip this title unless you just want something entertaining.I personally found it very entertaining--read the whole thing in one day. 4 stars for entertainment!
4,A More Accurate View of of the Age of Sail,"John Harbron's book is a refreshing re-balance of naval history during the Age of Sail that counters the all too often Anglo-centric and borderline jingoist view of naval from authors like N.A.M Rodger. Despite what has been written about the Spanish Navy in the English speaking world, the facts stand out for themselves. Given that Armada was outnumbered and out gunned by the Royal Navy since about the 1650s, the fact of the matter is that the Armada did a fine job despite frequent attacks by Britain and it's privateers. The Spanish Empire held intact well ito the 1900s due in large part to it's great navy. Spain's navy produced great Admirals like Blas De Lezo, who was instrumental in helping acheive victory against the full might of the British during the War of Jenkin's Ear(1739-1748) when the British so wrongfully thought they had the Spanish Empire on the ropes."
1,Pure junk!!!,"Out of the box, I never expected this grinder to have a 1/2"" of wobble on the wheels. Ended up getting a Metabo instead. Jet tools are pure crap and I should have known better even trying one of these, let alone 2!! Amazon was awesome helping me out til I was happy and I give them an A+ for that."
2,it to 2 to get one right,"I was disappointed with the Jet product. The first one would not run. it to 2 to get one right. The second on had guard issues, and between the 2 one works fine.the manufacturer did make it right. I have other Jet products. this one disappointed."
1,Did not work out of the box,"My story is short: got the grinder out the box, plugged in...the wheel started very slowly and then stopped while the grinder was making a noise of an overloaded electrical enjine and then began to heat up. I immediately unplugged and arranged for return. Will get something different now."
2,Pleased & Disapointed,"The Jet 8 inch grinder is a powerful, nicely substantive machine with one significant design flaw and a disappointing quality problem.The Design Flaw and my major complaint involves the really crappy aluminum work rests. Since most grinding work in the real world involves steel, aluminum in constant contact with much harder material simply wears away at a rate that soon renders the work rest usable. Even stamped steel would make a better work rest. I have fabricated steel work rests that will last as long as this otherwise well made grinder.My quality disappointment involves the grinding wheels which are so mall formed that the wobble makes immediate use impossible. While the wheels were concentric, the side wobble was out by 3/8 inch. Side dressing that much diminishes the useful width of the wheel and structural integrity substantially.My conclusion: Buying a new machine should not require fabricating serviceable work rests to make the tool truly useable."
4,A very useful machine,"This Model offers a lot for your buck. It allows 6 lines of text, so you can print multi-line address labels. It connects to your PC, allowing you to micro-manage your label layout. My only complaint is about 1 in 50 labels have to be reprinted because there are lines in the text. Although it happens very infrequently, it prevents me from giving this product 5 Stars. That being said, I still highly recommend this model."
5,LOVE this!,"Beautiful music. Great stories told. Very uplifting. Makes me think about things in a whole new way. Especially the song ""Homeless."""
3,Intersting,"Not bad, not amazing. This collection of essays does a good job of opening the mind and they're decently written. Nothing awe-striking, but commendable."
1,Tape ends in mid-paragraph; buy the book instead!,"Gould as always is a fountain of interesting ideas and keen insights. This tape version, however, will leave you frustrated. In the final essay, Gould tells us that ""there are two recent examples"" of new theories leading to the search for, and discovery of, new facts and data. The tape reaches the middle (?) of the exposition of the first of these; then ""end of side 8"". But, that's all the sides there are! UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD ANYONE BUY THIS VERSION OF THIS WORK!"
1,Taylor oven thermometer,"Based on the poor reviews of oven thermometers, I recently bought 4 of these to be sure I had a spare and was using 2 of them when one became stuck on 300 degrees even at room temperature so on to back-up number 3.There must be a reliable, moderately-priced oven thermometer out there. Seems like just a few years ago that they lasted until the calibration wore off. Now they quit in a few short weeks. Really, there's just no excuse for shoddy goods."
3,Now I cook better,"This inexpensive little thermometer has shown that the temp in my oven is way off. It is a little awkward to place or hang, but worth it to find out your cake will cook all the way through if you just set the oven temperature a little higher."
3,Difficult to read,"This book provides lots of good material and tends to cite people and terms previously mentioned in the book. However, the material can be difficult to understand at times as the descriptions are not always at their best."
1,low quality,"the seller said the book is in an acceptable condition, but when I got the book, the condition is really bad!I have to buy another one for my class!!!!"
5,Beautiful Book,"This is a Wonderful Book.It has background of Lyz Glick and Her Late Husband Jeremy Meeting,falling in Love,Colledge,Marriage,the baby Emmy and the Hijacking leading to Jeremy's death.I highly recommend this book."
3,romeovoid - better than foreigner,"i went through all of my uncle's records one sunday afternoon and i found a romeo void record - yeah, an ENTIRE romeo void record. Benefactor. the production is great and the music is a lot more interesting than i'd expected. it's better than a sharp stick in the eye, and all that. perfect nostalgia, but a little displaced for a kid that was still riding tricycles and dodging death when this was being recorded."
4,Classic-ness-osity-ism!,"This is the ONLY album you need by this band...beatnik new wave at its best. Sadly, they never broke out because at the infancy of music video, the ultra-talented lead singer was deemed visually unappealing...SADNESS! In my opinion, britney and paris hilton are far less appealing considering their obvious lack of talent.I don't put undeserving names in capitals!!!"
4,How It Works,The author explains how what we think programs our brain and how learning to think differently changes our brain: he explains the psyiology that underlies psychotherapy. He tells us what happens in the brain as we change our thoughts and feelings. (His thesis even explains why prayer and meditation work.)
5,A must Read!,I believe that this book is a must read for anyone going into counseling or clinic psychology. The book explains basic brain anatomy and brain functions. It gives the counselor solid and relevant information on how psychopathology may manifest it self in the brain. Cozolino compares healthy brains with those that are not healthy and gives a solid neuroscience base for anything ranging from PTSD to depression to personality disorders (he mostly focus on borderline personality disorder). He introduces the reader to the idea that psychotherapy my be able to change the structure of the brain.Well written and easy to read. Great gook!
5,Awesome seller!,Shipping was very quick and item was just as described. A pleasure doing business with.
1,Not received,I cant review this product as I still have not received it!!!!!!!! Would be nice if someone could track it and find what has happened!!
1,"Awkward viewing of ""Awkward""","Went thru ROKU to obtain the half hour show via AMAZON and22 minutes of taped material took 90 minutes to view.Disappointed and dissatisfied and I should ask for mymoney back, but I don't do that."
1,blank cd,i orded awkward season one and two. i believe it was back in november. i put it away for christmas. my son opened it and watched season one. very happy with it. when he went to start the second season it wouldnt work. we tried it in 2 wii's.. 2 dvd players. nothing. its like the cd is completely blank with nothing on it to view. im hoping someone fixes this problem for us as we do order alot from you and this was a christmas present. its pretty embarrassing. pls respond ty
2,Shame on EPIC records,"The Japanese version has 15 tracks, most of which are live. I had the short version t'll I was travelling and came across the import version. Don't buy this one. Seek out the Japanese version with all of the tracks."
4,A California Girl,"Any Californian blessed with daughters will want to read them/give them (according to whether they're nine or fifteen)a work which roots autonomous, adventurous women on both sides of the Sierra(s). Anyone driving to ski at Mammouth can animate the boredom (through Independence, etc.) with this work. And as for a genteel assault on S.F. (the ""City"") by a pioneer woman medical student, this will steel your daughter for the scalpel and for any derision that may still hover in surgical theaters and dissection labs."
3,Why no theme song? Here it is.,"Many old classics released on DVD today are minus the original theme songs. My husband use to duplicate videos for a living. He said he thought the theme songs were missing because they were under a copyright licence. The shows themselves are possibly public domain which means they can be reproduced for little or nothing, but the songs are under a different licence. That means they would have to be paid for, or maybe the owner would have to be paid a royalty. This way anyone with a duplicating business can duplicate these classic, replace the theme songs and still make money."
3,"5 Stars for Dick Van Dyke, 1 Star for Petticoat Junction","It appears Dick Van Dyke hasn't been edited badly, still has good picture quality and has the original music. Petticoat Junction, on the other hand, has music replacements and not so good picture quality. It has the same dumb music that the Beverly Hillbillies has."
2,External Modem,Hiro External USB 56K V.92 ModemI had a lot of problems with this modem.If you are running Windows 2000 professional with a Intel motherboardI would not recommend buying this unit.
3,not what i needed,I didn't realize the shaft was as large as the bit itself. Not the sellers fault but my own. It's way too think for the drill press I have. Oh well live an learn!
1,Don't buy this spatula,I bought this spatula 5 months ago. I used it several times a week but the blade came apart from the handle. It has two little prongs that will not stay in the handle any longer. For the price I paid this was very poor workmanship and way over priced. Next time I will spend less on one with rivets.
2,not great,"The stand arrived pretty beat up. I guess that is why it was priced so low. After I bought this one the price doubled. One of the leveling feet is bent up 45. There are dents and creases in the apron. Each corner was beat up and the epoxy paint is chipped/peeling. I can make it work, but it will take some fabrication/welding. The advertisement should have read this is not a 1st quality product or had dents/scratches."
1,USELESS!,Thought I was ordering DVD.....VHS arrived. USELESS! A waste of my money. Will not make that mistake again....I hope! Trash
1,MAJOR PROBLEMS,Ordered this product with high hopes. I was extremely disappointed. I ordered size 11. The right moc was over a size 12 and long and narrow. The left moc must have been a size 9 or less and was extra wide. The left moc also had something that looked like spray paint or spray glue on the top of it. The left moc had an insole insert that was much larger than the moc and overlapped on to the heel part. Both mocs had tissue paper stuck to the the glue between the moc and the bottom of the insole. I returned the moccasins at a cost of almost $10.00 for shipping. I am shocked and disappointed in Minnetonka's product and think Amazon does a disservice by offering this product. I would not recommended this product to ANYONE!!!
3,Why oh why?,"Why oh why do these come with suede laces?! I loved the mocs but you should plan on replacing the laces with leather laces, which is no easy task.Oddly enough, I found a pair in a brick and mortar store and they had.......leather laces. So why not when we buy them on line?I use these as my daily drivers and the rest of the moc has been great, although I have just recently worn out the nubs on the soles. But again, I have worn them every day for the past 4-months no matter what I was doing or where I was going (except when formal wear was required). You can't expect the soles to last too long under when you wear them like I do."
1,Don't By These,The bottoms on thes mocs are not of a good quality material. After only 2 months they started to rip away from the leather. I had the other driving mocs from Minnetoka and they lasted me for several years. I have been buying Minnetonka mocs for 20 years and I sorry to say that these mocs are the first ones that I have owned whose quality is a zero.
1,do not buy these shoes,these shoes are horrible......the rubber pads push up on the front part of your foot putting it at an unnatural angle.......I wore them for 4 hours & my feet hurt & continued to hurt for 3 days ........it was a complete waste of my $60.......I usually don't give my opinion about products but maybe this will keep someone from wasting their money
1,Looks better in the picture,This mocs do not look like the image. These are sized way too big. The cowhide has a cheap house slipper look.
5,Minnetonka Moccasin's,It was finally time to replace my Minnetonka Moccasin's after years of use. I selected the Men's Driving Moc for combined indoor/outdoor utilization and anticipate years of use.
5,So hard to find narrow slippers/mocs and these are great!,"My husband has narrow feet and it's hard enough to find nice men's shoes in a narrow width, much less narrow moccasins! He'd been wearing the same pair of mocs for almost 20 years -- and they were in really bad shape, worn completely through the sole. So I was so happy to find not just narrow moc's but Minnetonka brand mocs! They fit him perfectly and he loves them. He wasn't really interested in the driving moc sole but now he's glad to have it so he doesn't have to change his shoes to do quick errands like driving one of the kids to a friend's house. We feel certain these will last him another 20 years!"
5,Great Moccasin,"I have owned these moccasins for a year. They are worn daily. I have found them to be exactly what I was looking for in a moccasin. After a very short breaking in period they became soft, comfortable and a perfect fit. It is already apparent that the ""driving"" construction durability features will have them lasting for long period of time. These moccasins are a great value and the real deal. Bought through Amazon with zero complaints. Highly recommended."
4,great soundtrack,"This cd was great because it had a lot of international music, and the genre is awsome. My favorite band on this cd is the Pixies. If you've never been interested in this type of thing you should get it, cause you'll be suprised. It's kind of hard to find it in stores around me, and I was thrilled that Amazon.com had it. Again, I think its a great compilation, and I recommend it to all music lovers."
4,Bob's Best,I like the P-Touch 1500PC very much. I had a P-Touch 2500 for years but it was not compatible with my new Mac running OS 10.5.4. I bought the 1500 because I had such good luck with the 2500 and all the label tapes I had fit the 1500.
3,Won't Work on Windows 2000 Professional,"Upgraded to Windows 2000 Professional and the printer will not work. Spoke with Brother and they told me it was a Windows 2000 problem, that nothing was wrong with their software, then have thousands installed . . . Brother's Customer Service would not take a ""Problem Report"" and could offer no advise . . . just it's Windows 2000 fault . . . sorry, this is a wrong answer."
1,Discontinued Model,This is a discontinued model. Do not see any new Brother Label Printers that work with Mac. The printer driver will not work with 10.7 (Lion).
5,Outstanding - even among Bacharach's works...,"Songs: 1- Mexican Divorce, 2- (They Long To Be) Close To You, 3- Nikki, 4- Wives and Lovers, 5- All Kinds of People, 6- ""And The People Were With Her"" (Suite for Orquestra), 7- April Fools, 8- Hasbrook Heights, 9- Freefall, 10- One Less Bell To Answer.Five stars to each recording. Let's say you don't know April Fools or And The People Were With Her, or you never heard the 6 min. version of Wives and Lovers. More than enough reason to buy the CD.After you listen to this album you will want to hear some of the other albums, such as Make It Easy on Yourself, Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid, and Reach Out."
2,Not for me,"I agree completely with the review from C. Kerby. There are some helpful insights, but for the most part, I feel as though I am being preached to by a hippified zen transindentalist. I also must read this book for a class, and I don't like the way the book takes the long road to get to the points.I also think her examples of Larry King and Barbara Walters being examples of good listeners are weak. They get paid big bucks to listen, yet they still ask poor and unrelated follow-up questions because they are thinking ahead of their interview, and about ratings over listening.I think the author should work in construction for awhile and see if she can have any success changing hearts and getting people to listen in that sea of dysfunction. Good luck.I don't mean to be unkind, but I think the book neglects using boundaries with dark minded control freaks, and is a bit naive. ""What we have here is a failure to communicate. Some men, you just can't reach."" (Cool Hand Luke)"
2,Another person telling us what to do,"Like most self-help products, this one is an example of the author's biases and meaningless anecdotes that do not illustrate a point or theme. While this book holds valuable advice on communication, ie listen and be open while listening, it is filled with empty talk on how to be a better listener. I had to get this book for a communications class and learned far more from the instructor and his created handbook than this published book. As far as self help goes, my unpublished prof had more to offer than this lady! Okay if you can get it for less than 5 bucks"
2,Zen of Listening,"I am pleased at the time it took to receive my item. However, this book was marked up throughout it's entirety which made it difficult for me to read. I believe I would have enjoyed reading this book if it did not have so many distractions in it. It seems that the previous owner had a lot of comments to note in the book as well."
4,The Zen of listening,"This is an excellent book! It investigates important aspects of communication seemingly neglected today, utilizing different yet practical approaches to improve one's ability to listen. Rebecca Shafir appies her experiences with the hearing impaired to promote better listening by all. She seeks to differentiate between listening and truly hearing what is being said. In an age where the extorvert is valued and constant dialogue is promoted, Ms. Shafir explores a different approach, guiding the reader into a paradigm shift when examining attitudes and approaches toward overall communication. This is a must read for people who are considering a career in communications or related fields. This book will help anyone who seeks to improve his/her listening skills."
5,Excellent,"This book totally transformed the way I listen! Using the techniques from this book: - I no longer have to focus on how I am going to respond. - I acually hear what the person is saying. - I don't experience stress about communicating. People comment that I communicate more effectively now, and all I've changed is how I listen. The book I felt dragged a little in the beginning, but if you just hang in there, you will be well rewarded!"
2,Disappointed,"I struggled with this book, but that might be down to my style. Books written from the ""I"" point of view often leave me cold, as the ego of the author somehow intrudes upon, and diminishes the value of, the content. There was some useful stuff in here but I could have condensed it by about 80%. Sentences like ""If you answered 'Sometimes' to many of the questions, then obviously you are a sometimes listener."" are so trite as to be almost worthless. And throughout the book there are claims about the efficacy of the content that just somehow seemed to create a tone of superiority. I tried to like it. I am very keen to improve my listening skills, both in my profession and in my home life. But what I got from this book was a poor return on the time and money I invested in it. Sorry. Books that resonate with me I tend to keep and go back to them, whether frequently or otherwise. They get well-thumbed. Not this one. Would someone like to buy my copy? Going cheap."
1,Boring,I believe Ms.Krentz has forgotten the meaning of the word variety. This book is boring. Don't waste your money her Plots are the same in just about all her books. If you have read one of her books you have read them all the only things that seem to change are the names.
2,"You've read 3 or 4, you've read them all","I personally kept hoping that she would evolve from the this cookie cutter style of writing, but I've finally given up. Contrary to most authors, Jayne's best work (in all her three pseudonyms) was her earlier work. My favourites are her Trilogy as Jayne Castle, Hidden Talents, Perfect Partners, and a few others. The main characters in all her books are basically the same, but now I'm affraid that the novelty has worn off."
1,"Same old, same old","What a disappointment. Krentz just seems to be recycling bits and pieces of her old books. It's the same hardbitten businessman, yuppie cuisine, New Age nonsense, etc. The characters are simply flat; more ""Krentz caricatures"" than people. Worse, there isn't a flicker of genuine emotion in the whole darned thing. Save your money. This is a dud."
3,Disappointing,"I make it a point not to read the amazon.com reviews until after I have read the book. I do not want any undue influences. I read it in less than 3 days, but I had a problem keeping all the characters straight in my mind. JAK failed to develop the characters enough to make them stand out in your mind. She introduced them, told you where they worked and who they were related to .... all on one page. The plot was acceptable. The two main characters were acceptable. It just didn't seem to have the ""flow"" that her other books contained. I've been buying her books based on previous enjoyment, but I may have to start looking for an author to replace her."
3,DISAPPOINTING!!!!!,The story had no substance and it seemed like I read this book before. The characters were wooden and I really did not care if they got together or not. The next time I buy a hardcover book I will definitely read the reviews. I can't not believe that Ms. Krantz wrote this book. It was not up to her standards.
2,Again...another New Age story?!,"As if her past books didn't dwell enough on New Age(rs) and their obsession with crystals, JAK once again has let me down! Having read her for years (and still enjoying her Amanda Quick historical novels), I am disappointed in her mystical and New Age story lines. She is such a good writer that it is a waste of her talents to issue yet another book on the New Age nonsense! I miss her earlier style of writing."
3,Truly the Beholder,"I have been a Krentz fan since she first started wrting series romances. What got me interested in her stories was the interaction between the characters and the mystery. In Eye of the Beholder, the mystery is still there, but I was disappointed with the interaction between the characters. Trask and Alexa did not click for me as well as some of her other characters have. I enjoyed reading the book. I even liked the mystery, but the ending was not what I expect from Krentz. A fan from way back"
2,"I wouldn't read it twice, though","The first JAK book I read was 'Trust Me', and I must say I was greatly entertained by the witty dialogue, the fun, the humor. I was totally immersed in the world created by the book itself, like watching a movie.So, it was with great expectations that I picked up ""Eye of the Beholder"". While it is not really a great disappointment, I find myself skipping pages. The story did not really give a lasting impression. It's ... okaaay, I guess. Not bad. But not that good either.The dialogues are not as colorful as in ""Trust Me"", and the characters a rather 'flat' and 'dull'. The only real character I like is Harriet McClelland, the art forger, and to think she only appears at the end of the whole story.I wouldn't read it twice, and I'm glad I only borrowed it from a friend, because I think it's not really worth buying.Well, I'm not giving up on JAK yet. I still have a lot of her books to devour."
1,"Same old, Same old","There was nothing new or original in this book. Its the same basic plot and characters of her last few books, but with less charm and wit. I'd skip this one and hope she captures a spark in her next novel."
2,Definitely not one of Jayne's best.,Where oh where is the Jayne Krentz of the early books - Family Man and Perfect Partners? The last books have been a disappointment to me. If it's a comtemporary book it is New Age and crystals and if it's an historical Amanda Quick it is a map. Enough already. I have saved every one of her books but this last one is going to the second hand store as fast as possible to get something out of it. I get the sense this book was written for a deadline and her heart was not really in it. I've not given up on JK but I hope I have the discipline to wait until the next book comes out in paperback at least. Enough already.
2,Not Krentz's Best Effort,"I really hate to say this since I LOVE Jayne Ann Krentz's books, but I didn't care for this book very much. Lately her books, while still somewhat enjoyable, have been rather flat and predictable, sort of ""if you've read one, you've read them all."" Now, I love the New Age influences and the quirky characters in her books, but I'd like a fresh twist on the old theme. And I definitely think that twist is missing here.My recommendations to those contemplating the purchase of this book are:If you haven't read her other novels, buy one of those instead. They really are better books and well-worth your time.If you have read all her other novels, buy this one too but wait for the paperback. Better yet, check it out at your local library. And, if you have other books in a pile waiting to be read, don't bother with this one.Sorry, Ms. Krentz. I am looking forward to your next effort, though."
5,FIRST AND DEFINITELY NOT LAST,This was my first Jayne Krentz book and I could not have been more thrilled with it. Her characters were captivating from the get go and the plot was as twisted as any I have read before. The killer is not revealed until the very end and I was up all night trying to GUESS WHO? I would have to say that I have become a JAK fan. I love romantic suspense and she gave it to me in full force in Eye of the Beholder. Great work. I can not wait for her next book.
2,Nothing to dream on!,"Find an older Krentz, Castle, Quick, or other of Jayne Ann's pseudonyms on vacation. Anyone can have an off day, unfortunately, this was one for Jayne Ann Krentz.Normally one of my favorite authors, which ever century or planet she chooses to expose, this effort lacked the humor and the spark. Unlike some readers, I don't have to 'believe.' Sometimes, I don't want to think about believeable!Please take me back to Serendipity, New St. Helen's, Zantalia, or even Seattle! Avalon doesn't do it."
5,This is one smooth grinder,"After reading all the horror stories about under-powered grinders that vibrate tools off the workbench I was a little hesitant to purchase the Jet 6"" grinder since there were no reviews. Given the Jet 8"" grinder had a lot of good reviews I decided to take a chance. The grinder arrived well packed, in perfect condition, no missing parts and assembly was easy. Once assembled I was ready for the power-on test and was prepared to deal with some vibration. Upon hitting the power button the grinder came up to speed quickly and ran smooth. When I say smooth, I mean GLASS smooth. I'm not kidding, it ran so smooth and quiet that you almost could not tell it was running. I did some test grinding on pieces of scrap that I had laying around and the grinder seems very powerful. This grinder should be perfect for my home workshop."
4,A good intro into AI,"It is not for mad scientists wanting to build a robot army for world domination, it is about getting computers to solve problems by mimicking the natural world. From Neural networks to Evolutionary algorithms, each of the books chapters cover a different aspect of nature inspired artificial intelligence, and real world applications each approach could be, or is used for. It is entertaining, fascinating and an easy enough read. The big thing I got out of this book is that with a little creative programming, computers can be used for so much more then just simple number crunching."
5,Lots of Info!,"This book has dozens of patterns, styling info, collars, necklines, sleeves, etc. A gage chart, dozens of photos of various tecniques, how to resize and reshape styles, etc.Wouldn't be without it!Diana"
1,YOU'LL BE SORRY! No better than a $50 ap,"I bought three of these and have been struggling with them for 6 weeks. One day it all works great, the next there are many dropped connections ot you can authenticate with only one device at a time: I'm using all static IP's with WPA/PSK TKIP. Even when authenticated and connected with good signal cannot reach the LAN, cannot ping anything.The tech support is dysfunctional: on hold repeatedly, never getting a resolution. One ""escalated"" case took 4 weeks to get an answer and the answer is that the WAG302 is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS CE 5.0 WIRELESS DEVICES! Well, be advised, it works no better with laptops and desktops.If you have a lot of time on your hands, then try it out. I mean a lot of time."
1,Stay Away,"The only good thing about this AP is how easy it is to setup. There is nothing ""business class"" about this AP (that's how it's being advertised and priced).It will perform acceptably in a ""clean"" wireless environment. However, it has extremely poor performance even if a single additional AP is present. A ""business class"" AP that doesn't consider a building with multiple offices/floors, and subsequently the possibility of multiple APs, makes this unsuitable for any serious business use whatsoever. If it was designed to deal with such an environment, it's extremely poor design.You will obtain the same performance from a $50 home use AP. Don't spend your money on this.BTW, the ""auto-cell"" feature is non-existent. It's not even mentioned in the newer version of this AP (v2). So the last comment about firmware upgrade is inaccurate. Even a firmware upgrade of the v1 version of this product will **remove** auto-cell (never worked anyway, so it's really not a loss)."
1,dont let ng slime u,"Previous review: knows *everything* about wireless. Haha.Thats funny.Must be NG or affiliate, because this product is utter garbageadvertising WPA-2 and its not in the product or in the recentand only firmware upgrade that even ng admits is buggy.We had run into the exact same dhcp problem andNG support confirmed it a hardware issue in the product.Simple networks (typically run by peeps that know *everything*)won't manifest prob. I could go on about probs, but easier to visittheir online support."
3,o.k.,It is an o.k. book to give you some ideas on what Grandmasters do to perfect their game. Pick up on the hints and use them. I have and the last tourney I did I went 4 out of 5 for wins.
3,The good and the bad,"This toy is fun. My two guys are loving it - playing with it everyday since it arrived. It encourages a lot of imaginative play. That is the good side. The bad is obvious. No matter how hard you try, you will be sweeping sand multiple times while they play. This Space Patrol version has an extra challenge - the black sand turns the kids hands black which results in black handprints on the walls, the doors, the trim... I would say if you are an adventurous parent who would let your kids play with sand inside, do yourself a favor and get another version with light colored sand."
4,Space Sandbox is a Hit!,"Bought this for my 3 year old son's birthday. He absolutely loves it and plays with it almost daily. We have to set and enforce careful rules of play with it, but it works out OK and he loves it. I would consider buying other little sandbox sets, but I think we are going to try and make some of our own."
1,"""To Each His Own Hermeneutics""","I was quite disappointed in this book. In a very ""round about"" way Virkler tells his readers that the Bible is to be interpreted personally, that is, no interpretation is wrong, and no interpretation is right, i.e., ""to each his own."" This type of new hermeneutic, though on the increase, decreases the authoritative nature of God's Word."
3,What I thought,"I was suppose to get a CD with the book, I never received one. I am still in the process of reading it. It came quickly and in great shape..."
4,Great place to start,Virkler is a fluid writer who is great at condensing the subject matter into easily attainable categories. This is a good entry point into the wonderful subject of Hermeneutics and Virkler does a great job in presenting it.
1,This tape is useless ...don't waist your money,The tape is very thin and nearly impossible to remove backing without it getting stck together. What a waiste of money.
4,Mounting Tape used for attaching USB hub to PC,I used this Mounting Tape for attaching USB hub to PC as suggested in reviews of the hub. Indeed it has made a solid connection and hopefully will remove reasonably easily when the time comes.
2,Not that great,There are some reviews that say this tape is as close to contact cement that you are going to get. Not true. I have tired a few different uses where I didn't want to use a screw and the tape has failed every time. I would say its a notch up from normal use double sided tape but thats about it.
5,Very happy with this purchase!,"We purchased this product for our home theater screen. It has worked perfectly so far for that use. We previously had a real screen but it was easily scratched and very expensive. With the paper if anything happens, we can just remove and replace and our picture looks great!"
2,"Unlikable characters, no coherent plot","Bjarni and his brothers steal their abusive father's ship and leave 12th century Iceland. Bjarni allows himself to be captured by a chieftain to let his brother escape with the man's daughter. When his brothers fail to return and rescue him, Bjarni manages to escape and is befriended by the residents of a small English town, and when he leaves for the city, a young woman follows him.I like historical fiction, but I still need likable characters and some kind of coherent plot. This book lacked both. I managed to wade through the first half before giving up. The only element I can recommend is acceptable spelling and grammar."
4,Amazing looking documentary,"Incredibly shot (almost all gorgeous helicopter shots from all over the world),very well meaning, but slightly preachy and simplistic documentary pleadingfor global awareness about climate change.Really worth seeing for the images, and a worthwhile message, if a bit heavyhanded. My only other slight problem; by having almost everything shotfrom above the visual impact ultimately starts to wear off just a bit.But this sounds more critical than I mean to be. It isn't often a film makesyou gasp with the quality of its images, and look at the world (literally)in a new way."
4,Good movie - okay audio,"Well - the audio is dubbed and there is static whenever the person is talking, its more noticeable if you don't have any background noise. The message can get preachy towards the end, but I think the cinematography is absolutely stunning. They have used footage from this film in multiple other movies, including ""The Tree of Life""."
5,Stunning!,"This is a magnificent production. I'm now watching it on the National Geographic channel and had to check to see if a DVD was available. No commercials to interrupt the thread!The photography is stunning, the music enjoyably fitting and the narrator's voice smooth and clear. The story is informative, sad and scary.Yes, this production conveys the message that the current economic model of consumption is not conducive to long-term survival (in the manner to which we have become accustomed) where a secure supply of uncontaminated food/water and adequate shelter/clothing are a given.Sometimes ""a picture is worth a thousand words""."
3,Hmmm...,"Visually stunning, but... did anyone else notice that, according to this film, the concept of ""cities"" came about only 600 years ago? Hmmm. Also, last time I checked, the Grand Canyon is in Arizona, not in Colorado, as Ms. Close would like us to believe. The film lost credibility for me with those 2 doozies, so I was unable to feel confident in the accuracy of the rest of the facts."
5,Home an excellent Bluray nature -earth documentary movie,Excellent story of Earth our home and changes that are occuring. Excellent sound and video. Highly recommend it.
2,Garbage C+++++++++++++++++++++++++,THERE IS NOTHING AMAZING ABOUT THIS DVD RATHER THAN BORING SO CALLED EDUCATIONAL DOCUMENTARY!!!IMAGES ARE OK IF NOT SUCKS COMPARE TO PLANET EARTH OR LIFE OR HUMAN PLANET.....BE AWARE DON'T BUY IT...THIS IS COMPLETE GARBAGE
5,Credits not quite right,"This is an excellent show about our home planet - well done. One slight glitch I've noticed is that everywhere this film is listed, Actor Glen Close is listed as the narrator. In reality, his voice is never heard anywhere in this production. The narration is beautifully done by a female voice with a slight British accent, by the name of Isabelle DeLannoy. She is listed in the closing credits under ""cometary""."
1,Beware,"My copy was defective and disc did not play. I requested refund and got it, but was disappointed since I really wanted to watch this documentary. #$%&!""#!!!"
2,Splendid Photography Destroyed by Eco-Whiner Babble & Lies,"If you want to witness breathtaking photography acompanied by a narrative that spews global warming BS and condemnation of the human race then this is the ticket for you.I enjoy camping, hiking, nature photography, astronomy and I recycle, am for clean air & water. I am an outdoors person. Science is also a passion of mine. Real science, the kind of science that isn't afraid to examine possibilities that aren't politically correct. That being said...When I purchased this I expected to hear global warming BS here and there throughout. But, 10 minutes or so into it I had to shut off the sound and enjoy the filmography. What a waste of photographic talent & such a shame."
3,No idea,I have no idea what to think about this documentary because you sent me a copy set for the wrong region.So thanks for nothing.
2,Holes,"Great idea. Beautiful images. But the director is much more talented at cinematography than screen writing. There were some odd errors, such as ""the first towns appeared over 600 years ago"" which caused us all to scratch our heads. Wouldn't have been so bad, but my elementary aged kids questioned everything the narrator said subsequently. I also have to agree with other reviewers who found the style of the narration condescending and accusatory at times. I accept the basic premise that our planet is beautiful and fragile, and that we humans must accept our responsibility to care for it. Unfortunately much of that message was lost in the over-stated delivery style."
5,No Words to Explain,"The most stunning information I've received in an entire life of ""book"" learning.Absolutely run to rent this. Should be required viewing by every human in every country in the world. Or at least by those of us that are making the most negative impact to the world.Stunning is the only word that really describes it.""Home"" is about how our world works as far as consumption and demand, and how our demands are affecting the world. I had no idea how big cattle production was, and the cost to the planet associated with it.Gorgeous, stunning photography also..."
1,5 star film stored on a ZERO star media,"I saw this film on YouTube and it was beautiful but resolution was low so I bought the Blu-RayVersion from amazon with some other films. I tried to play this film but this film will not play on myplayer, because it is not from the correct zone. I did not know they still use that old nasty trickfrom the days of old DVDs. This Zone manipulation is powered by pure greed. It only punishespeople who are honest and pay for the film. I am starting to understand hackers who hack theirplayers to be Zone Free or even downloaders of cracked Films.The film is probably worth a 5 stars but I am sadly giving this product onlyZero Stars.Amos"
1,Home,Very disappointed. We purchased the DVD via the Australian Amazon Website only to find that we received a version which can only be played in Region 1 (USA). When we tried to play it in Australia (Region 4) the DVD did not work. It is now sitting at home and can't be viewed. Why can't Amazon identify the obvious when it takes an order and asks for the postal address by sending a DVD with the correct Region setting. Any opportuniuty for a swap with the correct region setting would be much appreciated. Otherwise it has been a total waste of money. Otherwise i understand from what I have heard the DVD is a great view.
1,Shame,"Ugh, how dissapointing was it to watch this. I mean, the photos and flicks were great, but then it's all like ''This is pretty, isn't it? Well guess what, thanks to you, were destroying it.'' Seriously.I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm all for the environmentalist movement, but then again movie is called ''Home'', not ''Look at the forest fire you caused''.If you guys want a REAL look at the environment for the beauty it has, I STRONGLY recommend you have a look at ''Plante Earth'' by BBC, now THERE'S a nice view of the Earth without the lady who seem's to be in depression for the past 6 years narrating it."
1,Region problems,"Hi!Just want to note that if there are no Region information on a title, that is the case of this one it is Region 1. So don't bother if you live in Europe. The Amazon were kindly to refund my money because of this issue."
2,Climate-change Brainwashing,"Although the filmography here was quite beautiful, the entire film was pushing the man-made climate change agenda and demonizing CO2. Even though films like this, An Inconvenient Truth, etc. are eloquently portrayed and seem sincere, you have to remember that evil likes to hide behind a pretty face. It's sad really, the whole heart of the CO2 movement is about eugenics. Do yourselves a favor and Google search ""climate gate."" Environmentalism is a good thing, but this CO2 hype is an entirely different beast."
1,DONT BUY,ABSOLUTE RUBBISHDAMAGED DVD. LOCKED TO ONE ZONE.JUMPS PIXALATED AND JUST INCAPABLE OF VIEWING.IT IS COMPLETE STUFFED I DONT KNOW HOW THIS CAN PASS A QUALITY TEST.BOTH DVDS I BROUGHT WERE IN THE WRONG ZONE
1,A propaganda piece with no shame.,"Beautiful cinematograpy is marred by an arrogent, uninformed, dangerously ignorant narration.This movie is Anti-human, and as I happen to be a human, I find it ridiculous that this movie is believed by anyone.Turn off the sound and enjoy the beautiful visuals."
2,"A worthy first attempt, but solidly mediocre.","Jeremi Suri tries to do a lot with this book, his first (a re-vamping of his doctoral dissertation), and does not entirely succeed. A United States historian, he tries to use his understanding of 1968 in Berkeley, CA to understand the rest of the world, and the American lens does not always display clearly. He's obviously enamored of Charles de Gaulle, to a point where it's almost embarrassing, and his treatment of Mao's China leaves a lot to be desired. That being said, Power and Protest has some good moments, particularly when Suri discusses Germany (although this part is far too brief and could have been much better had de Gaulle gotten fewer accolades). Still, overall, it's just not that great, and his thesis is if anything disproven."
1,Ripoff,"$1.50 for two paragraphs, absolute ripoff, wish I could give less than a star!Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology: Cliques"
5,Good stuff to start the day with - not sappy.,"This is great soul food. Dealing with the everyday humps and bumps and pleasures of life. Always valuable. A ""we're all in the same same tub of shit, and yet ain't life sometimes great"" type of book"
5,Another great cap!,"This cap is a great cap and was a gift for my grandson. He collects all sport caps and was very pleased with this one. Thanks again, Amazon, great shopping experience."
4,dark blue not black,"Attention, this cap is dark blue and not black. I was disappointed but I kept it all the same. Perfect fit for me."
3,"Nice hat, wrong color.","The quality of this hat a good, just like every other hat that you will order, but it is not black. I purchased this hat because it looked black and the reviews said it was black. It is not black. If you are looking for a good navy hat, then it will be great for you, but if you want a black one, this is not it."
4,Took forever to get here,"Really a good, solid piece of headgear, well constructed, deep dark blue. Ordered it a week before the World Series, took about 3 weeks for delivery. By that time the series was a statistic."
1,MoleAttack Repellent,"I purchased 2 @ approximately $43.00, trying to rid my flower bed of moles. I followed the directions and prayed. Well, if they went anywhere.....the moles are back, .....what a waste of my money."
4,Man these guys were good!,I saw these guys when they were touring with Sandi Patty and immediately found them to be entertaining and wonderfully talented! The songs are great and their voices have a beautiful harmony.
4,"JET 321373 BD-920N 9-Inch Swing by 20-Inch between Centers 3/4 Horsepower Benchtop Hobby Woodworking Lathe, 115-Volt 1 Phase","Once again, very happy with this product though Amazon needs to correct the title on this item. It is a metal working lathe, not woodworking. I had to call to confirm that what I was ordering was what I wanted. Customer service was very helpful and thorough. Shipping and whole transaction rates right up there."
4,metal lathes,"I have considered for sometime a small lathe to do some of my lathe work, as I had two much smaller lathes and they will only do the very small work,The 9x20 will handle the larger work that I need to do,it is well made and I can still do the smaller jobs that I have.Wish that I had made the move up before now."
4,Revolution happens in the mind,The Anarchists by James Joll is an informative and infitely interesting book which deals with the origins and the history of the Anarchist (anti)political movements in europe and briefly in the U.S. Joll comes forth as an objective reporter on this very misunderstood ideology. At times he is critical of the movementbut does paint a fairly unbiased picture. Joll explores the variety of ideals and schools of thought which characteized the anarchist movements of the past. Joll's book would be a good read for anyone who thinks that the term anarchy refers merely to chaos or that it is an invention of the youth to scare their parents. In light of the protests which abounded in 2000 it is a great read for anyone with political curiosity or concern.
3,Not has I had hope,"I thought these shoes were very reasonably priced and they seemed comfortable enough. However, I was wrong. They constantly pinch my 'pinky toes' and they do not lend for long walking or standing . To be fair maybe my feet are too wide for these shoes. Not a good buy."
3,Solitary Witch,This is a good book to have on the shelf. I don't have a coven so the solitary witch part got my interest. I had to read some other books before I read this one just to get a understanding on some of the things this one talked about tho.
5,very helpful,being a good white witch with this book is very helpful i am slowly again tapping into my powers when need be and honestly i am glad to own this book any other person who is one would adore to have this book yet i think this one is more for simple minded ones than complex ones who enjoy complex things and such. No offense i just like to do things at an easy and steady pace rather than hard and quite diffecult.
3,Expected Better.,"Not as good as i would have thought, disappionted willnot buy any more of hers.Spells for the Solitary Witch"
1,foolish,"I'm a beginner with common sense. Apparently, I disregarded it when I purchased this book. Who in their right mind would believe that burning different colored candles and drinking herbal tea will solve the worlds problems? This is complete garbage. The author even tells you, the job finder potions will only work if you're actively searching for a job (duh) and the happiness potions will only work if you get in a happy magickal state and if you are depressed you need a doctor. Duh again. I don't like it. I'm probably going to sell it to make some money back."
1,poor product description - this is a YOUTH hat!,I ordered two of these hats for gifts that I need for this weekend. They arrived today and I was VERY DISAPPOINTED to find out that they are YOUTH hats. There is nothing in the description stating that this is a youth product! Now I have a real dilemma in coming up with replacement gifts. It was also frustrating to have these ship via USPS (the Post Office) because their tracking system is so poor. My order had not been updated in four days. Now waiting to hear what my return options are.
2,poor description of product,"Nothing wrong with the hat. It was in great condition. Although, when my husband put it on his head, it was way too small. He compared it to his hat and even the bill was shorter. It was not clear that this was a youth hat. If MVP is what the size is suppose to stand for, it is unclear to those who wouldn't know the actual meaning is for YOUTH. Description should have just simply stated, youth or adult."
3,Mostly Cons.,"A real bummer! When I received the bandsaw a couple of small parts were missing and the blade guard and blade tension knob were badly damaged in shipping. Rather then going thru the hassle of returning it, I opted to contact the manufacturer and ask that the parts be replaced. The small missing parts were sent to me right away but the larger more important parts that had been damaged are still on backorder and I cannot use the saw util I get replacements. The guard could be jury rigged to work but, the blade tension knob makes the saw completely useless until it is replaced. The last time I contacted the manufacturer, they said they had a date of Mar 24, 2010 for them to receive the parts. After they receive them, who knows how long it will take for me to get them? I was further disgusted by the lack of any way to contact Amazon directly to discuss the problem with them. I think Amazon should make an effort to set up some sort of customer service contact, email or phone."
5,"Smaller than it looks, but overall a great saw for the price","This is a compromise saw. It's smaller than it looks (table height about 24"") and of course the jaw will only cut up to 5"" OD. And it only has 3 speeds. However for the price, it's well made and does the job it's supposed to do. Putting it together was very easy and it worked right out of the box. For a DIY or small shop, it's a great addition. It's also pretty quiet. We are satisfied."
4,Nice bandsaw,I bought the Jet Tools bandsaw with Amazon free delivery...a good deal and the delivery was on-time.The instructions aren't great. Need to be somewhat intuitive to figure out how to assemble...especially when setting up the belt tension on the motor using what appear to be two hinges.I found I had to do some creative bending and springing to get the automatic cut off piece to reliably shut off the switch at the end of a cut. Still don't have it completely fixed.Missing some bolts and nuts...used some I had on-hand.THE JET BANDSAW went together fairly easy (probably took me an hour to put together)... everything except for the cut-off switch adjustment.When I got it I did some test cuts on scrap metal and it worked well after I got it set up. The overall quality is good and worth the investment for my needs...
2,Has the strength of a dustbuster...,"I liked the price, I can't lie. I probably got the value for the price I bought this at.But, if I could do it over again, I would NOT purchase this. The vacuum does not have much strength at all. I probably should have read more reviews before purchasing this."
1,Useless,"I have had this vacuum for about 2 years, and I CANNOT wait until my new Bissell arrives this week. This is the most useless vacuum I have ever used. True, it is not too loud, its very light weight, and it does not over heat. That being said, it also doesn't pick things up! I typically find myself picking up after it on my hands and knees. You're better off sweeping your rug than to waste your money on this thing. Lesson learned: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!"
1,Don't throw away your $$!,"It may seem that this vacuum cleaner costs less than others but it's definitely not worth it, even as a children's vacuum.It is very noisy for its size, and you'll have a lot of trouble cleaning the filter - all of the dirt gets on the filter and one has to breathe a lot of dust after opening the cleaner.I could go on with disadvantages until tomorrow, but instead, take more $$ and get yourself a decent vacuum!"
4,Working fine,"This is a handy little vacuum. My wife is always pulling out our big tank vacuum to clean the entryway. Now she has the dirt devil. It doesn't pick up like her big machine, but it does do a good enough job. For what I paid for it, it does a good job."
1,practically useless - do not waste your money,"i bought this little piece of junk as a stop gap in between moving to a new place where i plan to buy a real vacuum. don't be fooled by a familiar name, this product is completely useless. you will save time and hassle by simply using a broom.the suction is laughable, and even a brand new machine has a tendency to deposit what little debris it managed to suck up right back on your floor the minute you turn it off. i've been reduced to flipping the thing upside down while its still running and shaking it in an attempt to make the debris actually enter its poorly designed chamber.nothing more need be said. this is a complete waste of money"
1,Has little to no power,"I live in a home with burba carpet. As I only have a one bedroom apartment, I figured this Dirt Devil would do the job. It did not! Matter of fact, it wouldnt even pick up debris on my kitchen's linoleum floor! I would not recommend this product to someone who needs a vacuum to work forreal!"
4,Dirt Devil Swift Stick,It gets the small job done fast with less electricity then using a regular vaccum cleaner.
