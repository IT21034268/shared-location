1,The time as come to allow imagination out.,"The controversy and anti-""Potter"" views over these marvelous books have been widespread. I say that the only evil that is being brought about is being captured in this book. Harry Potter is a wonderful way to allow kids to explore their imagination. The main thing in schools (I being a teacher) is having the students read. These books not only are a good source of vocabulary but are so perplexing that students cannot put them down. Allow the students to have creative imaginations and let us not strive to keep them contained in a truly unreligious world that we live in. More and more religious beliefs are stifling the very fabric of American society. I too am Christian. But magic and wizardry are not real and never will be. To say these books are evil is to denounce science. Let kids be kids and may the grown ups that run this world not forget that we were all children not so long ago."
1,It must stop,"While I admit, in our pop-culture world, the marketing of Harry Potter has reached an insane point, this does not take away from the fact the Harry Potter legend is as good as The Chronicles of Narnia, Lord of the Rings, and many other fantasy tales that take us back to that feeling of childhood wonder. Catholics and other Christians who prefer to avoid Potter mania need to leave the harmless fairy tale alone. Harry Potter will no more destroy or alter a child's religious belief than Cinderella or Star Wars."
4,Review from a non-scientific perspective,"I'm not going to say that I understand all of this. Most of it is way over my head, but after reading it, I can say that I understand more now than I did before. I'm planning on attacking it again in a couple years. Overall, however, Gardner does a good job of bring complicated scientific theory down to a plain English level by using diagrams and analogies."
1,scam advertising,"the item was Drill Bit 21 Pc Set 3/8"" Reduced Shank 1/16 to 1/2 by 64ths......there were 21 pieces sent, but no reduced shank pieces and no drill bigger than 3/8 inch..specifically, there was no 7/16 and no 1/2 inch.....i now realize that the advertised 21 pieces fit between 1/16 and 3/8......the pro tool shed ad (using amazon) is extremely misleading and false for providing no reduced shank drills bigger than 3/8.....even though the ad says to 1/2 inch.....do not buy anything from this company."
2,Dated but revealing,"If you want to understand some assumptions behind aversion to the concept of international treaties, this book may be revealing. This mid-70's rant is mainly diatribe against foreign aid, the United Nations, and that ""liberal"" Henry Kissinger. Helms makes some valid observations about personal responsibility, but fails to apply those principles to his analysis of international relations. This book deserves two stars for subtle psychoanalytic value."
2,"Better cover, please!","I love my Kindle and I use it a lot. The cover helps because it keeps me from accidentally hitting the previous page bar. However ... the little nubby thing that's supposed to keep the Kindle in place broke almost immediately. The result is that the Kindle keeps slipping as I read it. I was going to buy another cover, but if it's the same old same old I think I'll pass."
1,Poor design for amazing product,"I took the Kindle out of the box last night and placed it in its purpose-designed cover. It fell out. I put it back in -- it fell out again. If there were a third restraint at bottom right, it would work. As it is, the Kindle is not secured by the existing two restraints. The side-effect of this poor design is that it's easy to grab the Kindle as it drops and inadvertently activate the page turner. I kept losing my place. Very annoying. I am looking forward to a third party product to protect my $400 investment."
2,Kindle cover,"I like having a cover for the KIndle, however, this cover is not great. Because the on-off buttons are on the back of the device, you need to lift the device from the cover to turn it on or off. The little piece on the back, that is supposed to clip into the Kindle's back, broke off immediately. But, it does enable you to hold it more like a book. However, I would really like it to be available in different colors! The black is boring! I am sure better designs are in the works, but a well thought out design in the first place would have been great.In spite of the bad cover, I love my Kindle!"
2,Kindle cover review,"The Kindle cover is a great idea, but this one does not work. The kindle falls out every time I pick up the Kindle. The small clip that is supposed to hold it in is inadequate.The Kindle itself is great, but they dropped the ball on the cover."
1,Not Leather,"I can't believe people think this is a leather case! I know Amazon said it was for a long time, but they have now admitted it is NOT leather. The cover is not the best thing ever or the worst. I pretty much figured I'd buy an after market case. I'm waiting on my leather cover from medge. I'll be happy to have the book smell back."
3,Slow learner?,"The Kindle is a marvel, but the cover is less so. Thanks to the advice posted here, I finally got the Kindle to sit properly in the cover, which makes it much more user-friendly. (Pull up the cover's inside plastic tab, and slide the Kindle in while lying it flat on a table or other surface.)Now, if I can just keep the tab from popping off the back cover to the Kindle, which it does occasionally just to keep things amusing....I'll give this the benefit of the doubt, and give the leather a week or two to break in."
2,definitely flawed,"I LOVE my Kindle. However, the cover isn't really worth the effort it takes to use it. What you really need is a cover that will hold your Kindle in place and allow you to grasp it without pressing any buttons (harder than it sounds). This cover does not hold the Kindle securely in place and, if you're not careful, it will fall out! Authors who have written various manuals have suggested that you use the elastic band to loop it around and hold your Kindle in place from the lower-Right corner.Better suggestion - don't buy this one!"
2,Kindle Great; Cover Not So Much,"The Kindle cover needs some serious work. I believe you are supposed to be able to use the Kindle while in the cover, but it falls out so easily that it becomes too bothersome to deal with. Also, I tried using the elastic band to hold it in place, but the band falls directly on top of the scrolling device control, which makes those features more difficult to utilize.It's like they spent years designing the Kindle and about 5 minutes designing the cover for it."
3,Only Fair,"I haven't had the problems others have. It works reasonably well but it requires care to ensure the device doesn't fall out. I like the leather look. I prefer reading with the cover on rather than off. The next design has to address the ""falling out"" issue. If Kindle really takes off, there should be several after market alternatives that work better and I'm sure Kindle version 2.0 will correct the problem."
2,Needs better design!,"I just got my Kindle for Christmas and am enjoying the reader -- the cover however is not designed well -- (1)the use of ordinary sewing elastic to secure the cover in either its open or closed position is poor. The elastic will stretch and become a problem -- and it certainly looks cheap on a not so cheap product! Some type of magnetic clip or clasp would have been far better and much more attractive. (2) there needs to be a third and possible fourth ""corner"" to hold the Kindle in place -- the two flexible suede corners both on the left side are pretty useless without something on the right, and the little piece of plastic that is promoted to hold the Kindle into the case is pretty useless -- a clip, a snap, a magnet all would have been much more effective. But I love the Kindle!"
1,Kindle is fantastic the cover/case is absolutely not,The Kindle is a marvelous product but the enclosed case/cover is not useful at all.
2,KIndle Book Cover,"There are better options than this book cover. If you do not ""hook"" the Kindle into the cover its going to slip out. When you do get it ""hooked"" in, trying to reach the on/off switch will unhook it. When you do want to take it out when its ""hooked"" in the back cover comes off also. Its better than nothing, but if your buying it, go for the more expensive types with the 4 corner tabs to hold the Kindle in place."
3,Works but Could be Better,"I've had my Kindle nine months now and thought I would give my quick impressions.Pro's: I like the look and feel. I've had no problem with the cover's durability.Problems: Like the Kindle, I got used the the cover over time and have had few problems. A problem rarely mentioned is what happens when other people want to hold your Kindle (a common event). You have to tell them to be careful or handle it a certain way for fear it will fall out and get damaged.Second I don't have as much problem with the Kindle falling out as much as the back battery cover getting pulled off. You have to be very careful when lifting the Kindle out or reaching behind for the switches. It's not unusual to end up with three pieces in your hand - cover, Kindle, and batter cover.All said and done the cover works ok but I'll probably try one of the new covers on the market when I have $50 to burn. Seems a bit unncessary.As for the device itself? I love it."
2,Replacement only,"I accidentally missed the word ""replacement"" in the title of this item. I bought a Kindle as a gift and purchased several accessories to go with it as well. The Kindle comes with one of these already. Do not buy this unless you have damaged or lost your original."
2,Need more choices,"I like my Kindle much more that I thought I would. I've always wanted a reader but never quite made the next step. When Amazon came out with theirs I knew I had to have it.The cover that comes with the reader is OK, but there should be other options available. Especially color! I hate that I look like I'm walking around holding a Bible! I want hot pink leather, or at least something different."
3,Amazon Kindle Leather Cover,"The Amazon Kindle leather cover was well made for the price, but I have the Model the kindle model #D00511 that my boyfriend got me for Christmas 2009 & It does not fit very well the Tabs that hold it in place are a bit small I have to really sqeeze it in & it is still not in right. I will have to shop around for a better one."
1,Sorely disappointed,"Two weeks after purchasing the ""first generation Kindle replacement cover"", the black, outer cover began to peel away on different parts of the cover. New cover looks worse than the one I disgarded."
3,It needs to secure better,"I love the size, it looks like a quality product, I like the strap. I like how the cover wraps around like the cover of a book.What I do not like is that the Kindle will not stay in the cover and it's so frustrating. I have read that some people use velcro which is what I will have to do."
2,Kindle Book Cover,"It's not a very good concept because I find that many times the Kindle slips out of the cover. It is not a secure fit. For $25.00 should come up with a better concept.Thanks,"
2,"Love the Kindle, hate the cover","My ""little nub"" that holds the Kindle in place is also already broken. (And it never really worked. More often, the back came off the Kindle, staying on the nub, and the Kindle came out of the cover.) The corner tabs are stretching (thanks to the person who suggested a solution for this). I do bend back the cover when I am reading and strap the elastic band across the back. The inside fabric is soft enough so if I am careful, the Kindle does not fall out. In summary, the cover is usable, barely, but needs work. If I were going to purchase a second cover, I would prefer a new design."
1,A Disaster !!,"This cover was definitely an after thought for the Kindle creators. It is bulky, does not stay on well, and falls off. What is up with that elastic rubber band to keep it closed ? Yuck ! Screaming !!Now look at a Sony PRS-505 unit and look how beautiful the hand finished leather cover fits. Slim, attractive, an integrated part of the unit. Amazon, please look at the Sony PRS-505 and learn. Please.....please......please......Until they wake up, look for some decent covers to be released by 3rd party companies."
2,Great idea BUT.....,"The cover is a great idea --- security for the device and planned ease of management of the book when reading. BUT, the little clip inside the cover is not big enough to hold the Kindle in place. It takes the slightest joggling of the device to unseat it from the cover and basically makes it more of a danger than a help. Surely either Kindle can come up with a better notch on the back cover or come up with a more secure fastening into the cover. I LOVE my Kindle. Due to the ability to use large print on the screen, I have read more lately than I have in years. Fix the cover problem and it's a near-perfect device!"
1,Sadly disappointed in this beta test cover,"What were they thinking when the designers created the ""corner pockets"" to hold the K into place in the cover? Moreover, the plastic ""clip"" onto which the K is supposed to sit is so totally mis-engineered that it is funny. Watching the K fall onto my lap/bed/floor has become an adventure.Woe is us who have suffered through this book cover experiment. I only hope that Amazon will compensate us with a new cover/kindle when the engineering department admits that it made a mistake and decides to market the K with a newly generated design and cover.Is there is anyone out there who can effectively turn on the rear mounted on/off switch without ""dislodging"" the K from it's cover?????Oh yes, the leather has a nice feel and the elastic strap does keep the K tucked away safely when not in use."
2,Kindle Cover,"I appreciate the Kindle Cover replacement as original was defective - holder broke and unit falls out of the cover. The replacement is ok, but a better secure cover needs to be provided with the product so I strongly recommend a redesign - you need the protection, but current cover provides minimal and over time breaks down - holder clip comes loose making cover pretty much useless except as a closed cover strapped down not in use. The answer is a better cover provided; not no cover."
4,I guess I am alone,"I must be doing something differently than most users, but I actually love my Kindle cover. I do read in bed, and have not had any issues with the Kindle falling out. As a previous review stated, the elastic band goes around the cover itself, not on the Kindle. If you put your Kindle down on the open cover at the right edge, then slide it over to the two corner covers, making certain to keep it flat, the little flap should grip onto the rubber underside of the Kindle. At least that worked for me. Good luck."
2,Better Cover a Must!,"I love my Kindle, but I feel as if the cheaply made cover is sooo out of step with the technological wonder it is designed to hold. The little ""clip"" that is supposed to hold the Kindle in the folder broke the day I opened my Kindle. I do enjoy the ease of folding back the cover and securing with the elastic strap, but the Kindle does not automatically stay within the cover - I have to use a finger to hold it in the frame. Please follow the ipod model and come out with a variety of covers."
1,A Complete Waste of Money,"This cover was misrepresented. It's advertised to fit the 1st generation Kindle, but it doesn't fit. The kindle is too long for the cover. A complete and total rip off by Amazon!! No wonder it's discontinued."
1,I really want this product but...,I was really excited to get it because it has a strap to hold it closed but...it didn't fit and we have to return it. Now I do not know which to buy????
2,Generation 1 Covers need redesign,"I bought the Generation 1 Kindle when the price was 3 times what it is now. I believe in the device and am quite fond of using it. I particularly like enlarging the print on the pages. The cover that I ordered was not as expensive as many of the next generations' others. The cover DOES NOT fit the Kindle. The little ""tabs"" that are sewn into the cover at the top and bottom are too small to hold the device. They protrude above the back cover when the Kindle is inserted. The elastic band works OK, but does not keep the Kindle in the cover. The elastic band is the ONLY device on the cover to keep the Kindle in Place; therefore, the long end which is 7 3/4"" is left open and the Kindle is 8"". Bottom line: The cover just doesn't fit!!! I am disappointed. I want to keep my Kindle safe and secure."
2,Kindle book cover - nothing special,"I love my Kindle, but I'm not in love with the cover. Yes it protects the Kindle, but I wish they could design a more effective way of securing the 'K' than just that little flap inside the back cover. Every time lift the 'K' to switch it on, the flap disengages - most annoying.The Kindle is a wonderful device and deserves a better designed cover; one the reflects the innovation and creativity that went into its design and development."
3,How to Make the Cover Useful,"Like everyone else, I've found the cover of the Kindle to be lacking. The worst problem I had was any time I placed the slightest amount of pressure on the cover with the device installed, it would press the select button. If something was on top of the device or it was packed in a briefcase, there was a chance the select button would remain depressed constantly.I've given up trying to use the Kindle while it is in the cover. I only use the cover for protecting the device.I found the best way to do this is to turn the KIndle upside down and place the narrow end into the ""binding"" edge of the cover. The elastic strap then wraps around the entire right edge to hold the cover shut and the device inside. In this configuration, you can't read with it, but at least it protects the device without inadvertantly pushing buttons. It will work until something better comes along."
1,not thought out and poor for its purpose,"I think someone thought having a ""book-like cover"" would play in with the theme of the ""book-like"" Kindle. Unfortunately, this should have opened by flipping over the top, not like a regular book where it renders two fo the most important controls difficult to get to. Also, the on switches for the device and for call are . . . on the back of the kindle and so you have to remove it from its protective case. Not good."
1,"For a $400.00 product, cover needs some work","I love the kindle, but the cover is too stiff to be useful while reading. Although it does help preven accidental page turning, the kindle can slide out much too easily & you lose your place trying to get it back in. The spine is way too stiff to bend back - I'm afraid of breaking it at an odd angle. Hope amazon comes up with something better to protect a serious investment!"
2,Velcro,"It's true, if you try to read the book the kindle falls out. Someone mentioned a spine which holds the kindle in. I didn't figure this out.I don't understand why people want screen protectors. I want to be able to get at the kindle when the cover is open. When the kindle is closed, the cover is pressed against the nice suede cover.NOW, for my contribution:I attached velcro to the back of the kindle and the inside of the cover.It works. Now my kindle doesn't fall out of the cover.There is an issue in that the velcro sticky-side stick to the suede cover is pretty close to the velcro fuzzy side stick to the other velcro. This means that taking the kindle out of the cover isn't something you want to do everyday. Luckily, now that my kindle doesn't fall out of the cover every time I look at it, I don't need to take my kindle out of the cover very often at all (I just installed a 4GB sd card. That's once.).Hope this helps."
3,Kindle Wouldn't Stay Put,"I too had a hard time with the cover when I first used my new Kindle. But after reading a thread in the Kindle Discussions, I pulled the tab up inside the cover a bit and really pushed the Kindle into the cover and it worked. Now my Kindle stays put and doesn't fall out and I don't accidentally hit the next page button anymore. Best of all, I can clip on the book light and read in bed. I'm still only giving it 3 stars because I feel Amazon should have made a more user friendly design."
1,Nearly worthless cover,The Kindle doesn't fit into the cover well. It keeps falling out. If you don't use the cover you keep accidentally hitting the page keys. It makes what is really a very nice product into an exasperating one.
2,"Don't judge a Kindle by its cover, which is lame","The bundled Kindle cover is very poorly designed and thought out. It makes it slightly too large to fit into a standard men's jacket pocket, and it doesn't even hold the Kindle particularly well. The strap seems designed to cover the scroller, though the fit is sloppy enough that I'm not sure exactly where it's meant to fit. And the cover won't quite support the Kindle upright, for reading hands-free on a table. The device badly needs some kind of screen protector, but this isn't it, and third parties don't seem to be selling them yet."
1,Flimsy and cheaply made,"The Kindle cover serves only one useful purpose, and that is to protect the device when I'm traveling. It is made from cheap materials and has no style to recommend it. The Kindle does not fit neatly inside it, and it is not possible to securely store the Kindle without the elastic band. Very unsatisfactory."
2,replacement cover,It would be a good cover IF it fit my kindle. It is way too small ! Wish Amazon would give dimensions with product info.
1,Wrong Size sent!,"With regret, I make this ""review"" to the fine people at Amazon.com I ALWAYS have been very satisfied with their services,all of them. However, getting tired of unzipping my Kindle pouch thingy, I sent for their ""cover"". My kindle is one of the first large white colored units with the 2 small holes on the left side of it, so that the kindle cover ""hooks"" inside the book cover, can grab onto it. The cover that was sent was too small and had no such hooks on it. Our local Post Office is far off, so I havent sent it back yet. If you order a book cover for your kindle, make sure you incluce its serial number. Maby if I did, the outcome would have been better. Thanks."
1,It doesn't fit,"I bought this cover for my 1st generation Kindle, but it is sized for the 3rd generation model. Very aggravating!!"
1,pitiful,"I am very much enjoying the Kindle itself...5 StarsHowever,Amazon should re-design this poor excuse for a cover and provide a free exchange to everyone who purchased a Kindle."
2,Amazing Kindle Needs New Covers,"I love the kindle, and I love the feel of the kindle in the cover. I hate the cover attachment mechanisms. Inside the cover is a little tab to grab hold of the battery cover of the kindle. I could not get the tab to latch onto the kindle easily and it broke off when I went to lift it a little. I have a solution... Amazon are your listening... offer a new battery cover that has hinge like holes on it. Create an outer cover that has mating hinge like holes in it. Then have a pin that joins the two hinges and locks into place in the cover... preventing accidental falls. My palm pilot has a slot it it that the cover pin slides into...very secure, never a problem...Rhino makes an aluminum case for my palm and a pouch...both very cool... maybe if Amazon makes a new battery cover, Rhino could make the new book cover. Don't let the cover problems keep you from buying the Kindle... Hopefully Amazon will fix this soon."
1,Not Impressed,"Love my Kindle; hate the cover. It's poorly (and inexpensively) made, it is difficult to use the Kindle when it's in the cover, and my Kindle slips out constantly. It's great for protecting my Kindle when I shove it into my briefcase, but other than that: not so much. If it hadn't come free with the original purchase, I would be angry."
2,Cover that does not fit,"I was given a gift kindle cover for Christmas that was returned because it was for a later Kindle & ordered what I thought would fit. However, this cover does not fit well either but atleast protects the screen."
1,Book cover,"This is the second book cover for 1st generation kindle I have ordered. Neither of them fit the Kindle. I gave the first one away and returned the second one. I do not recommend this product online, it needs to be purchased at a brick and mortar store where you can make sure the cover fits."
1,Does not fit,I Ordered this cover for the first generation unit but it does not fit at all. The cover is 1/2 inch too short.
4,"Attractive, slim cover","Liked this cover a lot. It's real leather. It's slim, fits well and stays on better than some of the covers. I like the wrap around elastic band. The only thing that would make it better is a card pocket on the inside front cover."
1,Does not fit.,"I really should have paid heed to the reviews of this product and not purchased it - but I was desperate for a cover. As mentioned by a myriad of other customers, the product does not fit the kindle. I returned this product and continue to search for a cover. I would not recommend this to anyone!"
2,kindle cover,"item is a little too small for the kindle. the holders are not sufficient to keep the kindle in the cover without the elastic band. if the band breaks, you are sol."
2,the wrong item,It wasn't what I thought. It was intended for the earliest Kindle and this was not the correct product. Very difficult to find a quality cover for the ealier Kindle.
1,Disappointed Buyer,This product specifically advertise to be a replacement cover for the 1st generation Kindle. One would assume it will fit the 1st generation Kindle. Surprise!!!! the cover is 1/2 inch short.
2,Bad Fit,"My Kindle does not fit in the four corners to hold it in the cover. The measuresments are correct, just the corners are smaller."
1,Cheap cover to protect expensive product?,"I love my Kindle but....who designed this cover??? When I first put my Kindle in and held the book upright, it fell out. I put the Kindle back in, and the tab cracked off. And the little corner pockets were flimsy and useless to begin with. Refuse to buy a new cover for $25 because it's going to do the same thing."
1,Kindle Customer Service,"The Kindle was a Christmas gift and after spending a significant amount of time trying to get the Kindle to stay in this cover, I gave up and called Kindle CS. I explained the problems that I was having and I was told that the cover was designed for protection and NOT to be used when reading. Interesting, since page 12 of the Kindle guide describes ""Reading with the Cover On"". He said that he could send me another cover but that it would not work any differently and suggested that I ""search"" Amazon and find one that's right for me. WHAT??!! $359 dollars and I should buy another case! The Kindle designers, Kindle Customer Service and Jeff Bezos should read the reviews on this case. Customers considering purchasing a Kindle should demand a better case to protect their investment."
1,Kindle Cover,The cover that comes with the Kindle is dreadful. I had problems with the Kindle falling out of the cover. Sometimes it was so difficult to hold that it would cause distractions while reading. I replaced the cover with a much better one and I no longer have a problem.
1,Worse than useless!,"This cover is worse than no cover at all. The cover is supposed to protect your Kindle, but it only works while it is closed up and not in use. The first day I had my Kindle, three times it fell out of this cover, rolled off my lap, and landed on the floor UNPROTECTED! If Amazon ever invents a better Kindle cover than this, I hope they send one to all of us who got stuck with this piece of junk, and I hope they send it to us free of charge!"
4,Basil Rathbone & Nigel Bruce finatic,"I own all the 14 selections of Basil Rathbone & Nigel Bruces Sherlock Holmes movies & I must admit this was one of my least favorites. That doesn't mean I still wouldn't own it because I do, have bought it twice in both formats vhs & dvd. But for some reason like the others better. But is your a finantic like me you'll still want it, own it & can't do without it."
5,Ground Breaking,"This record is one of the seminal recordings in Jazz and perhaps one of the most interesting developments in music as a whole. Cecil Taylor, along with Ornette Coleman, is considered the father of Free or Avant-garde Jazz. Together with ""Conquistador"" this album demonstrated what that Jazz was to be. Taylor reaches musical spaces previously explored only by Messiaen. He is to the piano what Ornette and Albert Ayler and Charlie Parker were to their instruments. An evolutionary step for music & for mankind."
2,NOT an impulse purchase...for fans only!,"Cecil Taylor's work is characterized by hard-hitting, VERY fast piano playing that doesn't conform much to traditional jazz structures of melody or rhythm. It requires having approached jazz through some other course first to appreciate, which in a nutshell means that if you aren't into avant-garde jazz (Ornette Coleman, Archie Shepp, etc.), this is going to sound like so much pounding on instruments. Even when he's doing standards (there are none on this record) they don't fall into any traditional interpretation...they go WAY leftfield, and fans of the avant style wouldn't have it any other way.If, however, you're a fan of smooth jazz or even just more traditional jazz (Coltrane, Miles, etc.) this record - nay, MOST of Taylor's records - will drive you out the room. Listen to a friend's first and see if you're into it. This is NOT an impulse purchase."
1,the jokes on you,"is this guy putting us on? all his albums sound the same and the reviews do as well-if your not hip enough or intellectual enough than you can't understand this deep moving experience. stick to music you enjoy, not what your supposed to ""understand""-this music is for the few people recording it, not those who want music than can experience and feel something from."
5,Masterpiece of form and improvisation,"It's hard to understand why anyone would be proud not to understand something and the listener from Seattle's remark that this music has no form proves he doesn't. What established Unit Structures as a classic is that Taylor paved the way for composition within the sphere of so-called free jazz. Most of this music is tightly ordered (Taylor gets remarkable sonorities from the two reeds especially) and the solos elaborate on the ""unit structures."" Maybe the trick for a new listener is not to listen too hard, but rather let the music wash over you until you can hear it with some familiarity. I've been listening to Taylor for more about 15 years and for me this album remains one of his most refreshing, enigmatic, and joyful works. Unfortunately, Taylor's liner notes aren't too helpful; for a better understanding of his music, check out Gary Giddins's Visions of Jazz and Ekkehard Jost's Free Jazz."
5,One of the great pianists of the 20th century,"Cecil Taylor forced people to question their beliefs about not only what is jazz music, but what is music at all, and his music is still making people run these thoughts through their minds today. A true avant-gardist, but with an obvious love for the style of Monk and other jazz greats. Taylor must be admired for his uncompromising innovation, and his pure talent on his instrument simply cannot be denied. Unit Structures is one of his brightest shining records and I reccommend it to anyone looking for something to seriously push their limits."
5,Wonderful Ride,"Female P.I. Gayle Fisher needs a job but gets more than that with an investigation into a supposed suicide in the sleepy resort town of Shore Haven, Michigan. In the same vein as Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels and Alexander McCall Smith's ""No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency"" books, Wilma Kahn delivers a compelling read full of vivid images, sparkling dialogue, and continually escalating threats to Gayle's life."
2,Zach's Lie,Zach is a phony and his dad is a junkie. His dad goes to jail and the Osbournes change their names to the Grangers. The a druglord tries to find the Grangers. This book isn't that great.
5,Hard to put down!!,"I'm a teacher of grades 6-7-8 graders. I'm always looking for good read alouds. Well I found it in this book. It has suspense, mystery and it is set in modern times. Kids can really relate to this book. I can't wait to read it to my 8th graders this fall."
4,What do you get when you take the 'v' out of lives?,"Due to the fact that his dad is in jail, Zach had to change everything of himself. His name, his hometown, and even his hair color--he drew the line at dying his hair blonde. Who used to be Jack Osborne is now Zach Granger, with his sister (Joanne who is now Wanda) and mother (Patricia who is now Mrs. Granger), relocated and living what he thinks is safely in Elko, Nevada. They used to live in a huge house all the way in whoknowswhere, but now they live in a tiny house (at least 5 times smaller) where there are three E's to the town. Everyone knows Everything about Everybody. Maybe evena fourth--Eventually. Soon, Zach and his family's life is at stake with the three E's because of a journal that he writes in frequently. Omigosh, is he going to die? What's going to happen to his father? Find out, it's a really good book. I suggest it."
3,Zach's Lie,"I read the book Zach's Lie. It is about a boy named Jack and he is put it the witness protection center, becasue of his father. His mother, sister and him are in it too with him. They all get new names and live in the town called Elko. As troubles occur, Zack, ""Jack"", gets through them and learns alot.I thought this book was okay. It wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad. It was just in the middle. I would give it 3 on a scale of 1 to 5. I do recommend this book to a reader who just wants to read a book that doesn't make you fall asleep."
5,My reveiw from the montabella school,"The story is about a kid named zach his dad gets into a little bit of trouble. so they have to go and move to a new town and they meet a few people the also have the bad guys right on their trail and is this the end or not. Read the book to find out. I like this story very much It has alot of great story lines as well as an great goup of charectors such as zach. They are trying to get away from some bad people,so they get in to a little bit of trouble near the end.The story has alittle bit of slow parts and a few romance parts but the rest is either mystery or action. Zach finds a few nice people on his journey to a new life but thier is also some that he can't trust."
3,For Teens With Problems,"Zach's Lie was a very exciting book. Everyone should read this book. It teaches kids why they shouldn't do drugs. This book shows the way all drugs can really mess up your life. There is a section in the book that shows Zach talking to himself in his journal from, first person point of view. The book shows all the different ways to change your identity. The characters in the story have to change their identity because the area drug dealers were after them trying to sell them their drugs, and Zach goes through a lot of troubles trying to get away from them. I thought it was a preety good book, but it wasn't my favorite. I thought the book helped me out. So I reccomend this book to any teen who is any troubles in his/her life. I learned a lot from the book."
1,Terrible,"My wife is a native of Korea, and I got this to better communicate with her and her family. Each day I would go through a lesson and practice what I learned with her. But more than 70% of the time, she couldn't understand what I was saying. After getting across what I was trying to say, she said only someone born before 1930 would talk like that. I gave up after 10 lessons.There's also no mention of grammar in the lessons. Now I'm not looking for the intricacies of linguistics, but in Korean, the verb comes at the end of the sentence. This is never mentioned! Instead they force you to memorize backwards English, ""Now say, I would like 2 beers - literally I 2 beers would."" Very confusing. They also say, ""Sometimes you add the ending 'ga' to the end of words"", but they fail to mention when and why. I had to look online to find the answer.This is not a good place to learn Korean."
1,Buying it was a mistake,"I got this for my family with high hopes. We have many Korean friends and wanted to understand what they were saying to each other. After practicing a few lessons we tried it out, but no one understood what we were saying. It turns out that the language used on the CD is out of date and doesn't emulate modern speakers. This isn't so bad (my experience learning Japanese at school was similar), but it also turns out that one of the ""native speakers"" on the CD actually has a strong Korean-American accent."
4,An unusual book,"This book by Carole Cadwalladr is her first and she appears to be working hartd to make all of it tie in together. It is a little different from the normal book that I read but I found it an enjoyable read.She does get into some technicalities that may bore one and make you wonder how in the world it is important to the plot, but she normally succeeds in finding a way to tie it all together.Bet her next books will be even better.This was an enjoyable read.J. Robert Ewbank, author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
2,"Neatly-Developed Characters, But...","... the last fifth of the book simply unwound crazily, reeling away into sudden characterization changes, abrupt pop-up surprises that were unbelievable, at best, and depressing pronouncements of gloom. In fact, I asked myself, what does the protagonist have to live for, at the end? The baby? That didn't work for her own mother. I actually felt as if the author had tired of this whole novel-writing expedition, and was simply tryng to get rid of the plot and the characters quickly."
3,Intriguing but depressing,This book was suspenseful and kept you interesting in learning more about the family and its checkered past. I have to say I hated the main character - you wanted to give her a swift kick in the [...]! I thought the author had an interesting writing style and would look at other books by her in the future.
3,Good buildup,"I was finding this novel just so-so. But I found myself staying up late to continue reading just to find out what the climax was going to be after the big buildup. And it was a good one. The suspense was well done, and I liked the characters, although I don't think we needed that many of them to tell the story. The interweaving of the three stories was interesting, but nothing better than I've read before. I got this book because a reviewer compared the author to Zadie Smith and David Sedaris. I was disappointed to find that was an incorrect comparison. This doesn't live up to their work - but it is a good read. Not great, just good."
3,catchy love pop,"Taken individually, the songs are catchy pop tunes. As a collection the themes of the songs run together a little. Still a pretty good listen."
2,One big bubblegum song,"This is not so much an album as one continuous song. All of the songs are soooooo samey. Like some of the previous reviewers said, if you listen to one particular song, you might think, yeah, I like it, catchy. But then there's the next song in exactly the same vein...and the next...and the next....until it ceases to be catchy and begins being truly monotonous."
3,yeah,i would have to agree with mr. jason brown. the songs are great when sandwiched between some tullycraft and beat happening on a mix tape...but they do seem to run together a bit when taken as a whole on the album.
2,ho hum......,i tracked this CD down and bought it as i wanted a couple of songs id heard on a cool dvd called 'but im a cheerleader'. the cd's ok - but a lot of the songs sound the same. if it wasnt for the 2 songs i wanted i prob wouldnt have bought it.
5,Hilarious!,"Harmony, Bryce and Lucky Whitfield are three sisters who love each other immensely.Yes, they get into it and disagree at times, but the anger between them is short lived when one of them has a problem. They stand by each other no matter what the situation and they support each other no matter what the cost.Not only that, they all found good men to support them and stick things out with them through their hard times. (That was a little ""fairy tail-ish"" but all of Zane's books have ""fairy tail-ish"" situations and it's refreshing.)I enjoyed this book to the fullest because the characters were rich and vibrant. No one in this book was bland or uninteresting. Some of the situations were absolutely hilarious while others were very serious giving SOIA a good balance.SOIA is a good read."
5,Laugh-Out-Loud Funny,This hilarious novel will keep you on your toes as you read about the sexual escapades of three sisters.
3,3.5 stars,Sexy and funny! Zane's characters end up in the funniest situations that actually make you put the book down because you're laughing so hard! The sexual situations make you put the book down for other reasons! :-) Hehe!
1,WHAT?!?!?!?!?!,"THIS WAS ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ. TOTALLY UNREALISTIC AND JUST DUMB, THERE ARE NO OTHER WORDS TO DESCRIBE IT. IF YOU WANT TO READ GOOD AFRICAN AMERICAN BOOKS, PICK UP SISTER SOLIDER, ALICE WALKER, OMAR TYREE OR ANYONE BUT ZANE. PLEASE..."
2,not the best read,I had to push myself to finish this book. I purchased it for something light and humorous but received something rather boring and substance-lacking.
2,not what i expected,"I have read Zane's Addicted and was expecting much more from Shame on it All. I found the book extremely stereotypical, the dialog repetitive (she uses the down same phrases over and over again, like ""sepia eyes"" and ""fell out laughing""), and at times just downright ridiculous (being chased down the street by midgets at the midget farm). I also was irritated by the fact that Zane never said what Harmony's illness was. She hinted at it for most of the novel, but her diagnosis was never explained to the readers. This book was definitely lacking for me and the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because some parts were entertaining even if they were ridiculous and unrealistic."
1,SHAME ON IT ALL FOR PUBLISHING THIS BOOK!,"THIS BOOK WAS A WASTE OF TIME AND PAPER! THIS WAS SOME GARBAGE! I READ ADDICTED AND WAS LIKE MAN THIS IS A GOOD BOOK, LET ME TRY ANOTHER ONE OF ZANE BOOKS. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED! THIS WAS TRASH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE WAS THINKING WHEN SHE WROTE THIS, BUT SHE SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT TWICE! THE BOOK WAS NOT FUNNY AND IT DID NOT HAVE A POINT! I WAS DISGUSTED AFTER READING THIS BOOK!"
2,Shame on the Author.....,"although comical in nature, i did not enjoy the book as i was told by friends that i would. but, then Zane's writing has always left me wondering....i would tell anyone that Zane's other works 'Addicted' and 'Heatseekers' are more indicative of the author's true creativity.'Shame' made me think of a poorly written 'Bronze Thrills' byline! i was glad when i got to the end!explicit sex scenes do not create a page-turning novel!..."
4,Good Book About 3 Sisters & Life,"This book was about the Whitfield sisters, who are a force to be reckoned with. You mess with one, you deal with them all. This is another good book where Zane gives you that erotic imagination in this book as well. I loved how she brought the details out during certain situations to make you feel like you were actually there seeing what was taken place. I felt kinda of bad when reading the book about Luckys' situation until I got further in the book and seen how they dealt with her problem. Good Looking out Sisters is all I can say. Playa, Players, Don't mess with them Whitfields' Sisters."
4,Wild,"This was a pretty good book, hilariously funny at times. And wild just like Zane's other books. While this is not my favorite of hers, it was a good read. The first book I've ever read that had commercials!"
2,"Humorous, but NOT what I expected","I purchased this book because I had read reviews of Zane's other works and thought this would be promising. NOT. I felt as if I was reading the version that is given to the editor to make corrections on. This book was too ""surface"". Not a lot of depth here. Also the phrase "" Shame On It All""? I don't get it. I was disappointed at the lack of writing skill, but finished it to find out what happened to one of the characters.Also, what is up with the advertisments? Corny! I WON'T waste my money on another Zane book. Sorry - I tried."
2,Hot Garbage!!!!,The best way I could describe this book. I'm a Zane fan but this book was HOT GARBAGE...as if she was just racing to fulfill a deadline and just put any ole thing out there..it was horrible.SAVE YOUR MONEY...if you still want it contact me and I will give you mine. SERIOUSLY!
1,Ridiculous waste of time!,"I love to read a quick summer book as much as the next person, but after reading this attempt at storytelling by Zane, I feel cheated. The story lines are ludicrous and the characters are unrealistic and somewhat appalling. Zane portrays these African American women as sex-starved idiots with only one thing on their minds. A frightening thing that Zane leaves out of her characters amped up sex lives, is the mention of condom use. African American women are one of the fastest growing groups of newly infected HIV cases. Shame on YOU Zane for not incorporating condoms into the characters numerous sexcapades. I feel that there are better African American fiction writers and stories available and I hope the next book I find will be worth my time."
5,Zane does it again,"This is one of my all time favorite books. Zane is very gifted and should start making her books into movies. I can't want for Shame on it all again, it is taking way to long for that to come out.HURRY ZANE"
5,Yeahhhhhhh this thing was hittin!!!!!!,This book was like that I am so press to read part two them chics was off the hook!!!!! This is a must read!!!!!
3,Storyline Was Good,"I am reluctant to admit that this is one of Zane's best storylines, as least this one has some type of composition. Shame On It All covers the relationship between three sisters, their men and their friends. It covers their hairbrained schemes, ups and downs. Zane made you feel as if you were watching a soap opera, she even put in commercials in between the parts of the book, those I enjoyed the best and I did like it originality.I didn't like the ending because it seemed very typical and as I neared the end I expected it, but then I realized I was reading Zane and she is so very predictable. Out of all of Zane's book this and Addicted were the best.Later!!!!"
1,Waste of money!,"This novel was so unrealistic,outrageous, and stupid it was funny. You really couldn't relate to any of the characters, you had ""midgets"", goats, transvestites; no part of this book made any sense. This is my first and last purchase of any books by this author."
5,Da Bomb Reading,I read this book in 1 1/2 days! It was an excellent book from page 1 to the end. I consider this a re-reader which means I'd read it again. I highly recommend all of Zanes books!!
3,It was okay.,"This book was okay, it seemed like it would be a very quick read after I started it but it just kept going. The language of the characters was a bit distracting because I know the area very well but I don't know anyone who talks like the characters did."
5,A GOOD BOOK....,SHAME ON IT ALL WAS A GOOD READ FROM ZANE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I READ ONE OF HER BOOK AND THERE WERE NOT A LOT OF SEX GOING ON AND I REALLY LIKE THAT CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SECOND ONE
3,not her best...at all,"This was the second book i read by Zane and I was disappointed. My expectations were much higher after reading Addicted. It took way too long to get to the point of the story and to find out what was wrong with Harmony. And as for the midgets....puh-leese, that was stupid. HOWEVER, if this is the first book you've read by Zane don't let this discourage you from reading anymore. Her other books are much better, especially Addicted and Nervous."
3,Shame on Zane!,"""f you have ever observedthe behavior of a close friend of family member and wanted to scream out ""shame on you!"" then Shame On It All is the novel for you."" - ZaneI think that this book is terrible from my experience of reading this novel.As I read the first three chapters I started to lose interst in the novel.The author author explained more about the characters past lives, more than explaining their present situations.This is not one of Zane's best work. She showed her talent in her past novels Addictive and The Sex Chronicles."
1,boring,"This is book is so fictional. If you read one Zane book you have read them all. When you first start reading her books. they are good, but then as you read more and more it starts to get old. But hey how many different ways can you talk about sex. This book had a lot of good points but them it starts to get stupid. If you are reading a Zane book for the first time, them you might be like ... she is of the hook, but if your like me and have read many don't wast you time. She will not be getting any more of my business if she writes the same lines in every book except with different characters"
4,A Good Read,"Overall, the book was a pretty good read. For the fact that she kept me laughing, is enough to make me read more of her books. This book reminded me a lot of Soul Food the movie, without all that wonderful cooking."
4,"Fun, Family, Fabulous","Shame on it all was a fabulous read for me. (Although, Addicted is still my favorite.) This book had Zane's sexual writing style with a mix of family ties and relationships. There are countless laughs in the book. The Whitfield sisters were how a real family should be. Zane will take you inside each sister's life of drama, sex, problems, love, and revenge. It is a good book. Read it for yourself. I liked the way the book ended."
2,average with over the top antics,"Ok perhaps I shouldn't have read ""Addicted"" prior to reading ""Shame On It All"", but this book was off the wall. And I don't mean that in a good way. The personality of the main character in Addicted seemed like it was the same for one of the charcters (the middle sister)in this book. It was much of the same ""kick your a** attitude cause I'm it and I can do that"" personality in this one. But what made Shame bad was the over the top antics with the commercial breaks; the midgets; and that unbelieveable kidnap stunt with the college dean (who did deserve it actually). While I must admit that I do in fact enjoy Zane's writing style, this book did little to contribute to her growth as a writer of contemporary fiction."
3,Shame on it all,"I found this book funny. The commercial breaks were crazayy, and it made the book different. I wouldn't call it ""erotic"" there were freaky scenes but it was more of a comical book than being erotic. I would call this different and it's worth reading."
3,Expecting More,Well I was actually expecting a little bit more from this book. It was okay to a point but I did not like Zane using a serious situation in with so much sex. I believe she should have just stuck to the erotica and sex and not have included a dramatic situation with it. I also had a problem with the ending. Why wait so long to let us know what you figured out already? I was not impressed.
3,shame on it all is so so true,This book did not hold my intrest like everyone said it would. The HOT stuff was not so hot and then it was so far fetched at times that i was confused and found myself asking what is this more than once and then the plot was such a let down all i could say is SHAME ON! shame on it all IF YOU ARE BORED WITH NOTHING ELSE TO READ I SAY GO FOR IT
1,One of the stupidest book I've read in a long time!!,"I have never read a Zane book before and after reading this book, I can say I NEVER will again, the book starts off alright and you expect some substance, but it quickly begins to go down hill.The sponsor ads were pointless, not funny and a waste of paper, then she throws the silliness from the ads into the story which makes the story just annoying and unrealistic.The Harmony mystery was such a big secret and when they ""revealed"" what was wrong that was such a disappointment. The dean escapade was over the top and again....not realistic. The mandingo thing was disgusting and extremely stupid. I was very disappointed with this story and discourage anyone who doesn't have money to blow to stay away from this book."
4,Keep Them Coming!,"Zane, you have found a fan in me. You keep writing and i will definitely read them. My book club... will be reviewing your books soon. Keep up the GREAT work!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Nothing Shameful about it,"This was a wonderful book. I could not put it down, it had everything a good book should. Comedy, action,adventure and very detailed romantic scenes. I have read this book twice since I have owned it. I would definitely recommend this book to all Zane will definitely have money in my pocket from me."
4,Wild and Crazy,"The Whitfield sisters Bryce, Harmony and Lucky are three close knit sisters who share a bond of love. This is a great story of sisterly love. Hot erotic imagination. Zane does it grand style.Zane keep up the superb job. You are all that a bag of chips.Keep the faith and stay blessed!"
4,Damn this book was good.,"Shame on it all. Zane I must say you have put together another good book. I really didn't want to read this book, but I kept hearing so much about it so I had to read it. I'm glad I did, it was the bomb. I like the way the story line went. Next time keep the cartoons out. I like the way the sisters stuck together. Alright enough, I DEMAND THAT YOU READ THIS BOOK."
5,Long Lost LP..............................,"I had this album in 71' and I remembered the TULL-type flute but when I recieved this ahead of its time cd from amazon,my ears gladly welcomed an old friend..I HAD FORGOTTEN... this is an ""every-song-is-great""CD........also excellent is original album cover and inside photo / plus crisp audio!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,classic early earring,"I discovered this album after Moontan as I was lucky to have had a record store in the area that stocked a good deal of imports. I loved this album from the begining. Back home rocks, Yellow and blue is catchy and This is the Time of the Year is a great track. an exceptional treat is the original recording of Big Tree Blue Sea. A solid work from a truly great rock band. In my opinion much much better than The Stones"
3,Spend A Little More,"The VCR is noisy and sounds like its going to fall apart any time you put in a tape or eject one. Rewinding makes a grinding sound at times as well. All in all ... spend a few more bucks and get a bigger, more reliable set."
5,Wonderful combination of talents,Art Farmer Benny Golson and Bill Evans are just incredible together on this collection of originals and standards. Farmer and Golson went on to play together in the Jazztet but here the sound is a bit different primarily due to Evans remarkable piano playing. This is a truly fine CD and well worth checking out.
5,Clown Ministry,I was very pleased with the speed in which I received the above mentioned book and its condition.
1,It would not play due to area restrictions!,My loved one opened her gift. She was thrilled and loaded in in the DVR. Pressed play. Then a message appears that due to area restrictions it will not play!How long have we used it? Less than 10 seconds!Fraud. Thieves. Amazon should remove these crooks from their site.
5,Concert of Simon & Garfunkel is very nice,I like it. Movie & Sound are quality/ It's a good new for me. I had get satisfaction. I'd like to say to people to live in this music
1,"Good DVD, wrong region","While the DVD works great in my laptop, which is not region locked, I cannot watch this on my Blu-Ray player through my home theater system because it is not a US region disc."
2,Great Concert!,"This is a classic concert of our time. It plays very well on a computer, but it will not play on a dvd player in region 1, inspite the fact that it is labeled ""all regions"". It is in the PAL format which I learned the hard way, and will only play in region 2. The return policy is rather complicated for about an $8.00 purchase. If you're only going to play it on a computer, enjoy! I'll just buy another one somewhere else for the big screen TV."
2,"LIve, but sound quality dead","The problem is that the sound quality is terrible, not just bad. For a much better listening experience, consider ""Simon & Garfunkel - Old Friends, Live on Stage (2004)"" ( http://www.amazon.com/Simon-Garfunkel-Friends-Live-Stage/dp/B000679NLO/ ).I own both and have considered trading this central park concert disc in to the local music store for the $[...] credit as used. I love Paul's music and and Art's voice, and the ""old friends - live"" is played here every few weeks or so - ""concert in central park"", not."
3,Un impresionante concierto. Lástima la calidad de la producción,"Es mucho lo que se ha dicho de este concierto y es claro que fue un evento impresionante, lamentablemente la calidad del video no está a la altura. El sonido dolby estéreo se escucha bastante bien, pero pudo ser mejor.Esta es una joya para el recuerdo, lamentablemente parece una digitalización de un VHS."
3,Pretty Good,"This is pretty good..including all the great Simon and Garfunkel classics. Hard to believe the recording was made 22 years ago. Where has the time gone? Holy Cow!!It seemed like they rushed through a lot of the songs, apparently to keep the crowd energized. The slow songs, like ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" and ""April"" were the best. Art Garfunkel's vocals, what he adds to vocal harmony is what makes Simon and Garfunkel. Sure Paul Simon is good, but I'm more of a Garfunkel fan.GOOD BLAST FROM THE PAST. IN 1982, I WAS ONLY 22 YEARS OLD...YIKES."
1,Poor product,I ordered 2 copies of this DVD. Neither one would load or play. I tried 5 different players with the same negative results. It cost me $16 to send it back for a refund. I have not gotten any response form the company. I do not recommend this company.
1,Typical of a VHS release,"This DVD release in Dolby 2.0 should automatically omit all 5 and 4 star reviews for this release! A concert of this magnitude should be remastered in Dolby 5.1 or even better, DTS in order to hear as close to the full scope of sound as possible. Are you 4 and 5 star reviewers unaware of the fact that the audio on this release is completely inadequate? The VHS release is in the same league as the DVD release, and that's a shame."
5,L'unica nota negativa é non esserci potuti essere!,"Il video ovviamente risente degli anni, e per questo oggi può apparire non realizzato accuratamente, ma la ""semplicità"" delle immagini rispecchia la ""semplicità"" delle canzoni di S&G: colpisce diritto al cuore e ti coinvolge pienamente. Io consiglio vivamente questa VHS perché é un documento: la fotografia di un evento a cui chiunque vorrebbe aver partecipato, sia un fan del duo S&G che un amante della bella musica. Senza fronzoli: viva la grande musica!"
5,SEE THEM IN CONCERT,If you like Simom & Garfunkel. Go to www.SGtickets.com to win your free tickets to see Simon & Garfunkel in concert in the city of your choice. It's free and easy...
2,Be careful where you buy this,"I purchased the Concert in Central Park DVD from Movie Mars. Their DVD was created in Europe and uses the PAL color encoding system, but my DVD player supports only NTSC encoding. MY DVD is a Toshiba SD-3950 built in 2003; most newer players support both PAL and NTSC."
2,concert DVD disappointment,This could have been a great trip down memory lane - except the DVD kept skipping and sticking....making it too hard to enjoy. Am returning item reluctantly - this is definitely a classic concert.....cm
5,"Real Pros, And Not A Bad Song In The Bunch","This is a very, very good concert featuring most of the famous singing duo's best songs, of which there were many. There is a good mix of fast and slow songs and so-so stereo. Too bad they couldn't have re-mixed this in 5.1surround sound for the DVD.Simon and Garfunkel are such pros. The two harmonize so well it's amazing and even though they were live, playing in front of a mammoth crowd, most of their songs sound like perfect studio takes. Yes, a couple might not sound as good as those original studio recordings but some - thanks to the great backup band here - sound even better than the originals! Best of all, there are no ""clunkers"" in this group.The boys looked a bit smug, but when you can draw literally hundreds of thousands of fans to a concert, I guess it's hard to be humble. They were real superstars of their music era."
4,Great Music but Poor Quality,"Although the music is absolutely wonderful, it is difficult to watch the DVD. The sound does not match the mouth movements. That is VERY distracting. So, A+ to Simon and Garfunkel and F- to the DVD manufacturer."
4,This is a Title for my review,"That was a good night. Can't believe it was so long ago as it was because I remember it like it was yesterday. Very well captured on this video, and the performance speaks for itself. Great way to remember it if you were there and great way to experience it if you were not."
4,A great snapshot of Simon & Garfunkels career....,This is a well produced DVD featuring many favorites from the past hits of these two awesome songwriter's and performers. A must have for any old hippie !
3,Review,"I'm sure the item was fine, but I couldn't play it. I didn't know to look for the format, which was PAL, and I had to send it back."
2,An off night for the boys,"I'll cut to the chase...As a lifelong Simon & Garfunkel fan...lets be honest. The arrangements and performances of the Central park concert were pretty lame. After seeing it I figured that perhaps they were simply meant to stay in the studio..Then.....I reluctantly saw ""Old Friends"". The arrangements were the best I had heard...some surpassing the original studio versions. Much more energy to the music.....far superior to the bland concert in Central Park.Don't waste you money on this one....unless you need something for your insomnia."
3,Disappointing,"As a fan of McNaught, I felt after such a long wait for her next book, Someone To Watch Over Me was very disappointing. I felt that there was too much descriptive narrative going on....the character's got lost in the mystery, there was two little of the love story. And somehow the main character's got lost in the story. As I read the book, the most important thing that kept popping into my mind was the mystery and not the love story behind the main characters....I was also left with the feeling that the supporting characters were really the main characters. Hopefully, her next book will be up to par with ""Paradise"" and ""Perfect""."
2,Wait for the paperback....,I was so excited to get this novel. Perhaps my expectations were too high but I found this novel very slow and actually a bit boring. While I liked all the characters I never felt apart of their stories. The secondary characters are definitely the best part of the story.I definitely recommend waiting for paperback to buy or maybe even just borrowing it from a friend.If you want to read a contemporary Judith McNaught book pick up Paradise.
2,Disappointing!,"Ms McNaught seems to have lost her charisma in this book. I do not find the romance between Michael and Leigh as sensual and attractive as that between Mack and Sam. In fact, the story of the latter pair can be written as a separate story! I've so missed Whitney, My Love and The Kingdom of Dreams."
3,Fairly good,"I agree with most of the other reviews. I was more interested in the romance than the mystery and that is my clue that something was missing. Mystery, first with me. The only reason the romance was more interesting was that there were 2 going at the same time. Paradise and Perfect were better reads. Get it from the library."
5,Really Loved this Book!!,"This has to be my very favorite book of Judith McNaught. Very, very good..."
2,"If it's really nasty outside, this is better than daytime TV","I started this book on a rainy afternoon because it was handy and I'd have to put on a raincoat to go to the library and select another book. When I reached the halfway point, the rain stopped and I decided I really didn't care all that much for any of her characters, so I pitched this one and went to the local library and took out a Marcia Muller mystery. Had the rain lasted another day, I would have finished this one. Honest Injin! Don't buy this book, but if nothing else is available, give it a shot.Charlie"
4,Someone to Watch Over Me,"I loved the book. At first I didn't know if I wanted her husband to be dead or not. Her husband was a creep and didn't deserve her. By the end of the book, I was cheering for Michael. He got his chance to win her and he did. I also liked that the detectives got together too and without putting their jobs in jeopardy. It was nice to see Joe again.My personal favorite of her books is ""Perfect"". I read that one again and again."
5,One word - WOW!,"Someone to Watch Over Me is undoubtedly one of the best among Judith's novels - and a highlight for me as a fan of more than 12 years.. Leigh Kendall is a heroine who will remind you of other ""innately good"" female JM characters - think Elizabeth Cameron and Meredith Bancroft. It's much more of a traditional mystery than some other novels by JM we've read, which really surprised me... but she *is* Judith McNaught after all and she does NOT skimp on the romance. In fact, there are not one but two men in this book who you will definitely want to curl up with during this snowy winter we're having...I have to say it was worth every day of the long wait - For those who have been a little disappointed in more recent JM efforts, such as Night Whispers and Remember When, because they were much shorter than some of her earlier works, don't worry - this one is a nice, long well-rounded yarn you won't want to put down. Enjoy it."
2,disappointing,"I really enjoyed some of her prior books, but this one really falls short of expectations. I wish she stuck to what she was best known for (she was my romance comfort read). Maybe, she hopes to broaden her horizon and attract more readers who enjoy lots of suspense/mystery along with romance thrown in as a bonus. Sorry, this wasn't for me. I don't think I'm reading her next one."
5,Someone to Watch Over Me: A Novel,"I was not disappointed at all. I LOVED this book. I loved the build up to the plot and the lengthy investigation that followed. Not since Paradise and Prefect has a book entertained, thrilled, and satisfied me as this one has. Five stars are not enough to describe the brilliant of Judith McNaught. I have narrowed my book buying down to a dozen authors but Ms. McNaught will and always remains #1. I wait in eager anticipation for the next book. My only regret is that they don't come more frequently. BRAVO. WELL DONE!"
3,Enjoyable but wait for the paperback,"I was disappointed. I was waiting for Ms. McNaught's new novel but found it missing something. The novel was very slow to start, too detailed and was written with flashbacks that detracted from the flow of the story. The mystery ended abruptly with a self-revealing villian. I found the romance between her two main characters (an actress with a murdered husband and an unjustly convicted ex-con billionaire??) jumped forward so quickly it was hard to believe. The secondary romance more important than it should have been. As in previous novels Ms. McNaught tied the story to characters from her previous books, but this time the reader doesn't know or understand the connections between these characters and those in the previous books. It was an enjoyable read, but I wish I had waited for the paperback."
5,Another amazing book by Judith McNaught!!!!!!!!!!,"I really enjoyed this book. Judith McNaught has a wonderful way of captivating her reader (at least me). I could not put this book down. I was addicted. I enjoyed the characters in this book, and I thought the author developed the characters and their relationships wonderfully. This is my second book by Judith McNaught. I cannot wait to read some more of her books. As for romance, no one does it better!!!"
5,Give it 5 Stars....of Course!,"This was a terrific book--suspenseful and romantic! Based on most of the negative reviews here, it looks as if McNaught's historical fans want to persuade her to switch back to writing historicals by slamming her contemporaries. What a shame. I didn't buy this book when it came out because of the 3 star rating. I guess I should have read the individual reviews closely instead"
3,a review for someone to watch over me,"i'm just truly dissapointed with this book. initially mcnaught was writing about a time travel story, which i think would turn up better than this book, but then she rewrote it into this one.i wasn't really interested but considering of her bestsellers i succumbed. limited amount of romance and why does everyone in her books always become friends in the end anyways? how incredibly naive and cheesy. i don't know, don't hold on to my review if you're a big fan of hers though."
1,Disappointing,"This was the first time I'd ever read a Judith McNaught novel, which I received from a friend. The story started off okay, in my opinion, and overall, in general, I liked the story. However, my main problem with the book was that it appeared that Ms. McNaught's editor did not do his/her job! The book is very poorly edited (if at all) and I found it difficult to read because I couldn't get past the editing mistakes. The biggest one is that she often had two different characters speaking or having thoughts within the same paragraph! A big no-no. Each character is supposed to have his/her own separate paragraph when they speak or when their thoughts are being expressed.There were many other editorial mistakes (poor scene transitions, implausible actions and thoughts by characters, such as the detectives Shrader and Littleton; to name a couple) that took away from my enjoyment of this novel.Read it if you want something slight to pass time with."
1,Trashy,"I picked up this book because I'd read a review that made it sound like a mystery, and it was, for a while. Then it turned into a sappy romance, two sappy romances actually, and it lost what little appeal it might otherwise have had.I now realize that, as a general rule, when the author's name on the cover is bigger than the title, the book is not one I'm going to enjoy: Tom Clancy, John Grisham, Judith Krantz, et al ad nauseum.Another bad sign is a title that's a line from a song, and these seem to be proliferating. Pass them up if you like good writing."
5,My first McNaught,"Someone To Watch Over Me is the first Judith McNaught book I have ever read, but I assure you it will not be my last. I love a good mystery and have no qualms about reading more pages to find one. This book is not for the Harlequin Intrigue-er, but for the serious romantic who loves a real mystery. I was surprised again and again. And the dialogue! My God, she is a genius. Then the love scenes -- whoa. Not too much, but definitely enough. Michael Valente and Leigh Kendall are fabulous characters, as are Mack and Sam. I would recommend this book to anyone who would listen. Grab a copy and enjoy, but don't think you can put it down and get back to it, it was too riveting for me to even try! I was up all night finishing it. Kudos to Mrs. McNaught! Carol Leuchovius"
4,Good but not her best,"I am a big fan of Judith McNaught, however this was not one of her best. It was a quick read and good but I never got emotionally involved with her characters. I usually go through the range of emotions while reading her books but I didn't with this one. The romance between the secondary characters seemed more believable than the romance between Leigh and Michael. Their romance happened a little too quickly considering how much she claimed to have loved her husband Logan. It's is worth reading but not up to par with her previous novels."
4,"Not her best, but still a good read","As a big Judith McNaught fan, I also have been waiting anxiously for this book to come out. I agree with others that this was not one of her best books, bit it is still SO much better than some of the other current best-selling authors. So, I would still recommend it. I'm looking forward to her next book - hopefully she'll decide to do another historical!"
4,Another entertaining book by Judith McNaught,"I had been waiting for this book to come out after reading a Chapter 1 excerpt of ""Water's Edge"" at the end of ""Double Standards."" It took forever for ""Water's Edge"" to become ""Someone to Watch Over Me"" and I was so glad when it finall came out. Lately I seem to have read a lot of books about older, long-time married women finding out their husbands aren't what they thought and/or having their husbands disappear on them. However, the beautiful story between Leigh and Michael was just so sweet I had to keep reading! I've read all of Judith McNaught's books - ""Whitney, My Love"" is probably my favorite book ever - and I thought this one was great! Not the best, but definately worth the read."
1,Definitely Not Up To Speed On This One!,"I've read other books by this author and liked them. Not so on this one. This book dragged. I had the impression the author couldn't make up her mind if she was writing a mystery or a romance. If both which is what I suspect, she fell short of the mark. I'm sorry I didn't wait for the paperback. The three year wait for this book was not worth it. The book definitely did not leave me with a memory of it. In fact, I couldn't wait to get rid of it by passing it on to a friend. I'm hopeful the next book will be better and not so . . . thrown together."
4,Someone To Watch Over Me,"I have been waiting forever for Water's Edge, and I finally realized that Someone To Watch Over Me was the book I had been waiting for. I have all of Judith McNaught's books and I feel this one was not one of the best. I kept wondering why several characters from other novels appeared. I know what their characters were, but I couldn't really connect to them. Overall this book was okay. I am already waiting for her next book, I know it will be good."
4,someone to watch over me,"i was really pleased with this book. it has such an unusual plot. judith is a genuis. however, i have been looking forward to ""waters edge"" since 1999. before 1999, i had sworn off romance, until i stumbled across ""kingdom of dreams"". this book renewed my interest in romance, and i have been searching for ""waters edge"" since then. call me a sappy, male-dominating romantic (female-empowering;such a contradiction)story-searcher. all the other books i have read since then have just been the tide-me-over until ""waters edge"" release. judith, where is it ..........?"
2,Disappointing after a long wait,"I am a huge fan of Judith McNaught's and have been checking Amazon.com religiously for the publish date of ""Someone To Watch Over Me"". I don't purchase many hardback books but I make an exception for McNaught and this time I have to say that I was disappointed. For the first 200 pages I kept checking to make sure that McNaught did indeed write this book. It reminds me of a Mary Higgins Clark novel. I enjoy Clark but I was expecting McNaught's ""Whitney, My Love"" or ""Paradise"" characters in this book and it didn't deliver. I purchased this book intending to curl up with a steamy but substantive romance novel and instead was anxious to be done with it."
1,This in not an export!,"Judith McNaught never wrote Water's Edge.Ms. McNaught took the initial plot device of a car accident and used it as the beginning of her latest book - Someone to Watch Over Me. This is available in the US in hardback and paperback. She has no immediate plans for a time travel novel.It's a shame that almost 2 years after this was announced by her publisher, amazon.com continues to add to the reader's confusion by listing this as an available book."
2,Disappointment,"I have been a Judith McNaught reader and fan for a long time. I was very anxious to read this book as the gossip was that the publisher kept asking for rewrites as they were not happy with it. No wonder they did as it seems that Ms. McNaught is changing from writing romance periodic novels (which is her best style) to getting into mystery.All of her books in the past let you get to know the characters more so that you could get attached to them and be more into the story. BUt that wasn't accomplished in this book. I always say that if you keep putting a book done, it is entertaining you and this one didn't.Ms. McNaught if you read this, PLEASE GO BACK TO WRITING PERIODIC ROMANCE NOVELS! We miss them!."
1,extremely predictable,"I usually love romantic suspense novels, but this one was so bad that I had to force myself to finish it in the hopes that it would get better. The characters are your standard, stereotypical ones: ""the tortured heroine"", ""the dark hero"" and the ""wicked husband"". PUhleese. The storyline was utterely predictable and Leigh's new love came so fast it made my head spin. So much for the 13 years of marriage and love, and working through the self-doubt, anger and betrayal issues that usually come up when your perfect husband turns out not to be so perfect.As a reader of romantic suspense, I do understand that there is always going to be a standard plot that authors follow. But, this was a sub-par one at best. Thankfully I didn't actually pay money for this drivel. Skip it and read nora roberts or kay hooper's early stuff."
4,"very good, but not her best","I'm a die hard Judith McNaught Fan--this will complete my collection until her new book arrives, but doesn't beat some of her previous work. I did read it in a day though-very engrossing!"
4,Judith McNaught has talent,"This was a wonderful, enjoyable book. Michael Valente was one of the most compelling ""leading men"" to come along in a long time. Leigh was a bit cardboard, except when her acting talent was mentioned. But Valente, Hilda, Courtney, O'Hara, McCord, and Littleton more than make up for it. A real page-turner. I could hardly put it down. The evil murderer wrap-up was a tad disappointing, as was the ridiculous baby-on-board. The pregnancy was silly and detracted from the overall story."
2,2.5 stars,"After a terrible wreck, Leigh Kendall wakes to find that her husband, Logan Manning, is missing, likely dead. In short order, she becomes one of the suspects as Logan's secrets come to light, ones she even was not party to. Then, Michael Vallente, the other main suspect, wins her heart. Though neither is the killer, both are potential victims.** Despite being over five hundred pages in length, the story feels rushed in one sense and fails to stay on target. Multiple flashbacks continually jar the reader from one time to another, and the plot leaps from investigation to the main characters in a disjointed manner that is simply hard to follow. **"
2,I'm being generous giving it two stars.....,"This book was a huge disappointment. I stuck with it hoping things would get interesting, but they never did.There were so many lame, disappointing non-developments in the story. It was as if McNaught had open opportunities to make things more interesting, but blatantly ignored them. Sometimes when a storyline sucks the romantic aspects are compelling, but even those fell flat. If you ask me, Valente's character and his actions were completely creepy.I don't recommend this book. But don't get discouraged by the author. McNaught is awesome. I would suggest Paradise, Whitney, My Love, or Remember When."
4,commci commsi,it was ok. it graphics were good for a '97 movie. im kinda disapointed i bought it. it needed way WAY better dialoge. but hey i loved the show back when i was 7 so its all good.
3,Slightly above average anime,"If you know nothing of the Tenchi Muyo series, please note, familiarize yourself with the series. It is very hard to understand and/or follow if you know nothing of the series. Otherwise for everyone else it's an above average experience at best. It's pros- solid animation, wacky charecters, excellent dubbing, intruiging plot and story. It's cons- boring at times, slow to develop, and absense of traditional anime fight scenes and gore. But all the flaws can be overlooked for a good time!P.S.-Fun to see Tenchi's parents in High School!!!"
5,One of the best Yet!!,"One word can describe this anime.WOW!. This is one of my favorite anime movies of all time. I recently started watching tenchi muyo and it was one of the best. This movie has it all, a great story line, great characters and great music. In the series it didn't tell us much about tenchi's mother and this movie just says it all. His mom has got to be by far one of the best characters that I've seen so far. So if your a tenchi muyo fan and you don't own this movie: WHATS WRONG WITH YOU!!!!"
4,Tenchi Muyo movie review,"I really enjoyed The Tenchi Muyo movie. The plot was well done, the characters, like usual, were amusing, and the story was humorous and creative.The BEST thing about the movie was Tenchi's mother,Achika, because you never really see her normally, as she dies before the start of either series. The last fight scene is great!All in all, i'd say if you watch the show, or even if you like anime, it's a great title."
2,"I love the series, I hated the movie.","The series was so much better than the movie. I didn't like the costumes that Tenchi wore. The story was slow moving, I almost fell a sleep. It was awful. They could of done such a wonderful job with it. Too Bad."
4,~*~Interestingly Interesting~*~,Tenchi and the gang travel to the past when Tenchi's mom and dad's high school years. They must find out what's causing this problem thats making the Masaki family dissaper. This Tenchi Movie was very good and exciting. You get to see Tenchi's real mom and about his parents' young life. I would recomend this to anyone who likes Tenchi muyo and Anime. This has alot of action and is very funny.
5,A Definite must for Tenchi fans!,"After watching all three of the Tenchi movies, I would have to say this one is defintely the best one! It has a great mixture of comedy, action, and romance. Tenchi travels back in time with his friends to help save his mother's life from the evil Kain. I would have to say that Kain is probably one of the coolest badguys I have seen in a long time! The story at times can feel slow and confusing, but it picks up speed and the last 1/2 hour are great! Anyone who enjoyed the OAV Tenchi series should pick this one up!"
3,Sorry to its devoted fans,"I think Tenchi Muyo in Love was a good movie, just good. First off I would like to praise its wonderful animation on the characters and the extremely well done backgrounds, but this does not give a movie 5 stars. I did like the characters, heck I watch the show when I can, the reason I gave it 3 stars is because I wanted more from it, a deeper plot line, I guess because I have been watching Escaflowne. I wanted the criminal to not be that, just a criminal. I wanted him to have a good reason of an abscure thought process for his actions. I didn't want the story to be just good vs. evil, it is just to flat like that. I recomend renting this movie first before buying it, it may not be what your looking for and you, like myself might want a more sophisicated criminal and plot for a movie."
5,A great movie,I got into Tenchi a while ago and I thought that thise movie was better then the series. It had all the comedy that was on tv plus more! I think all Tenchi fans should get this.
5,A very entertaining bit of work,"The first thing I have to say about Tenchi is that it is very entertaining for any type of person. Also, who wouldn't want to be Tenchi? The guy has super powers and several women. Also, although the dubbing is stereotypical, (which I usually dislike, a la ""Akira"") in this case it actually benefits the characters. The tough one sounds extra tough, but not overboard. The gentle one has a gentle voice, but can sound threatening. The smart one sure sounds smart as the ditzy blond sound like a ditsy blond, but it all actually helps the movie rather than dumbs it down. Also, the plotline is rather interesting and diversified. Time travel, train travel, space travel, and dimension travel. Tragedy, happiness, comedy and action. Plus it is a decent length. I recommend this movie to anyone, anywhere, anyhow. Unless of course your mother just died. Then you shouldn't see it."
3,So So,"Ehhh... it was ok, ok is all. I like the Tenchi franchise, but this movie left me high and dry, only one scene of real action, even though the Tenchi series isnt known for having the greatest action in the anime world, I for some reason was expecting a better fight than what I saw.Its still an ok movie, but I only suggest buying it if you like to collect anime of the Tenchi franchise."
4,Good Animation,"This movie is about a guy named, Tenchi who goes back in time to save his parents. I loved the high quality animation and it seemed interesting. The dubbing was really good and I found it better than the subtitled version. I didn't find it funny and the you need to see the Tenchi Muyo TV series first to understand this film. It's a good buy!"
2,A snore,"I have to disagree with most, I found this movie very boring. The plot, at first interesting, became flat rather quickly. I thought this movie had a lot of potential in the first few moments. The problem is the conflict in this movie just takes way too long to resolve. It's not a particularly long movie, but when the space between conflict creation and resolving is filled mostly with dull, flat moments, it just feels so tedious. I was truly bored watching this movie.Great animation and artwork, there the movie definitely does not disappoint. If you're a hardcore Tenchi fan then obviously this review will fail to convince you. For the Tenchi casuals, I say look elsewhere, as Tenchi in general is actually pretty cool stuff."
3,"okay, but lame plot","I don't get why many think this movie is emotionally touching. Funny and action-packed, yeah, but heart-wrenching? If you want heart-wrenching, see Macross Plus. The plot with a powerful masked bad guy is overused and reminds me of Monster Rancher."
1,Not my cind of Film !!!,I bought this DVD because it got so high grades here. But i was very disapointed when i saw it. I really can't understand why somone would like this kind of movie ! Bad animated and bad sound. The only god animated films comes from Disney !
5,This is one of the best I have ever seen!,"I had always had a tiny interest in anime, but when I saw this movie for the first time back in 1996, I did backflips (metaphorically speaking)! The characters are funny, especially Mihoshi. The plot was sweet, the animation was awsome, and the english dubbing of this version was also very good. (To tell you the truth, I was worried that it would be cheesy Godzilla dialogue all the way through. I was waaaaaay wrong!) I highly recommend this masterpiece."
5,GREAT MOVIE,"This is one of the best Tenchi movies...because it has a good plot,kids can watch it, and you get to see Tenchi's Dad and Mom when they were young and in LOVE!! You have to know a little about Tenchi and the gang before you watch it...because it can get a little hard to understand...and also theres about 10 minutes that are silent with a little music it the background...boreing!If you like this movie...you should get Tenchi: The Daughter of darkness...and Tenchi Forever."
5,Tenchi IN LOVE!,"This movie was so cool! I liked the plot that Tenchi had to return to the past to defeat the evil Kain and save his mother Achika. This is a great movie but a bit suggestive at times so parents, any kids under 10-11: no watchy!"
2,DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE,"I'd heard a lot about Galactic before hearing this CD, and because of comparisons to bands like the Meters & JB's, I couldn't wait to hear it. It wasn't what I expected. There is funk there, but only in small doses. The highlight of the CD is ""There's Something Wrong With This Picture"", and ""Funky Bird"" is good, but the main riff is a blatant Meters rip-off. The rest of the album sinks into acid-jazz-esque mediocrity - non- thought provoking elevator music. If this is thefuture of funk, then I don't want to be anywhere near it. For authentic funk, check the ""original"" Meters tracks, and stuff like the Brand New Heavies' 1st album. Don't believe the hype."
2,stick to live stuff,"judging by the clips offered from amazon, this cd sounded like it could be as good as gba material, but i was dissapointed after the first spin, and i haven't put it back in since. It's not bad stuff, just that the jams are lacking in creativity, and the true funk feel is missing. Try Greyboy allstars(who are the BEST live), or try the next level in jambads: PHISH."
2,Bird generally past his prime by 53,"i disagree strongly with the reviewer who says bird never deserves less than 4 stars; i love bird's music as much as anybody and have listened since i was 16, however by 1953 most of what he is doing is a faint reminder of his earlier work, more cliches, its as if he is just going through the motions. which is ok; he had already done so much. could of been the alchohol and drugs, who knows, he did love the dorsey bros."
3,"Picture is correct, product description is not","I bought the game for the Arthur game, good that the picture was accurate as the description is not. You really get Arthur, Kid Pix, Zoombinis and Living books Stellaluna. The games are newer so they work just fine on a Windows 7 32bit system. The game uses your entire screen, unlike some older Arthur games which are only 640x480 small windows on your screen. My daughter really likes the Arthur math game, so overall for $5 and free shipping, great deal."
4,really swings,"Not too many people know of Stuff Smith, which is a shame 'cause he was a great musician who had a real swingin' band way back when. This is a great CD, with a lot of tracks you've never heard. Stuff Smith was not as good as Stephen Grapelli, but definitely swings more, kind of the way Oscar Aleman's swinging guitar was a nice contrast to Django Reinhardt (if you don't know about Oscar, get his CD ""Swing Guitar Masterpieces"")."
5,Long live the king!,Saban Bajramovic is definately at the top of his genre. Have not heard anyone better. He really deserves the name of Gypsy King of Serbia.
1,Another self improvement book,"This book is boring! Mostly it is about improving yourself, which any atheist could do. It doesn't talk about life after death either! This book's a loser."
3,if you play darts then you need this package,"I was surprised at how much damage I do to my darts every time we play, this is a good remady for an instant fix"
4,Life and Health Insurance Marketing,"This is the third edition of this work-horse text. The book is thoroughly comprehensive in its treatment of marketing for financial services (with a heavy emphasis on the insurance side of the industry). I found myself underlining passages, scribbling notes of agreement in the margins, and copying whole paragraphs to send to colleagues. If you are looking for an encyclopedic introduction to marketing principles tailored for the financial services industry, you won't find a better book."
4,The best of the Christian-oriented divorce books!,"Of the Christian-oriented books on divorce recovery that I've read, this is the best. Though it comes from a somewhat more fundamentalist perspective than I usually subscribe to, it avoids being preachy, and is accessible in tone, even for people who don't come from a fundamentalist background. I highly recommend this one for people dealing with an unwanted divorce - I'm keeping it around to share with others who are going through what I've been through!"
4,Peace and Guidance Through Your Divorce,"This book contains many practical suggestions to guide one through the divorce process. The author's legal perspective is evident in the preciseness of the information that is provided. However, beyond the practical navigation tips through this trying process, the many biblical references provide a spiritual framework to this painful experience. Regardless of one's religious affiliation, the scriptural excerpts are comforting and educational. This book is highly recomended for someone who is going through the process of divorce and is in need of emotional, spritual, and practical direction."
3,Get as much help as possible when going through separation or divorce!,You should read as much as possible when you are going through this life change - this one had some good pieces to it.
4,Good information,I thought it was a pretty good book. Lots of helpful information regarding the spiritual and also the legal side of divorce. Don't know if anything would have been different if he had had any kids from his marriage.
1,Very sad,"Someone posted earlier that they didn't believe anyone who upholds the Bible should be called a legalist. They later deleted the post, but I think it's necessary to comment on that. A legalist is one who upholds the letter of the Law above the spirit of the Law. Jesus is THE WORD. There are examples in the parables where Jesus places human need and compassion above the written Law. The fundamentalists place heavy yokes around people's necks, yet they don't know whether they would be able to bare up under the yoke if they were in the other's place. They will have to give an account for this one day. You reap what you sow. Jesus says, ""Come to me all you who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest; take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls, for my yoke is easy and my burden is light""."
1,This book has sullied my trash can,"The vast misrepresentations of scripture are only overshadowed by the misogony and personality disorders seeping from the text. Psychiatrists, take note! Undereducated hyper-fundamentalists are on display here to make all Christians look like Neanderthals, providing a wonderful case study for phychotherapists, or more fodder for liberal pundits.Those seeking comfort, Biblical understanding, or divorce = RUN!"
4,"Weigh Down, Vanilla","the item arrived promptly, and as far as dietary shakes go, it tastes about like how you would expect, but I do enjoy the flavor. I don't follow the regimen they list, but I do incorporate it into my diet."
3,mom of 3 girls,Poster is a little grainy looking. The packaging had big staples in it that scratched the poster when it came out. Then I noticed in very small blurry print a warning to remove the staples before unpacking. I guess I know for next time.
5,Charger for Pentax Camera,"I love this product. I searched high and low before finding this one. I was a bit skeptical at first, considering I wasn't able to find anything priced this low. It works like a charm."

5,"For ""visual"" learners and everyone else!","maranGraphics has done a wonderful job presenting MS Office 2000 in easy to understand graphics and words. In some cases, the pictures give a more complete understanding of the steps being explained than the words do! I generally do not like visually oriented manuals, because I find them too simplistic, and half the book is information I already understand. However, with this book, I learned several things from the very first lesson. I was quite familiar with MS Word 6.0, but don't let anyone tell you that you don't need training if you know MS Word 6.0; Microsoft has moved things around and changed how you work with Word. MaranGraphics' book on MS Word 2000 is just as useful as this one."
1,The only deck I ever burned,I hated this deck. It is extremely misogynistic. Usually if I just didn't like a deck I would give it away in hopes that it would speak to someone else but this is a deck that I truly felt like I would be passing on ill will if I gave it to anyone. The colors are faded and the artwork is not very detailed but that is not enough to hate it. What bothered me the most is all the women (of which there are few) are represented as evil or in torture (such as the rape of Gwenevere card). It doesn't represent the legend of King Authur as I know it and would only be a good deck if you hate women.
3,The magician Merlin,"I just rated this deck 3 stars because I have not used it yet, but answer to the critique of only using Merlin as the magician and that this not answer to the trickster part of the magician card: Besides being a magician in that Merlin used power, he was also a trickster, almost the court-jester of Arthur. A reference to that is also made in the book '78 cards of wisdom' both in the Rider-Waite explentaion of the fool and the magician."
5,From the author of Tales of Ancient Xenar,"Yes, I had this deck over 10 years ago. But I have it now again, just the deck itself and not the accompanying books that came with my original deck. I love using these cards very much. Anna-Marie Ferguson is a wonderful artist. She is truly blessed with her skill to be able to bring her visions of Camelot onto these wonderful cards. They contain both well-known Arthurian characters and not-so-known ones."
4,A good collection of classic chldren's games,"This is an excellent collection of classic games for children. Some of them are around 10 years old, but all ported to run under Windows XP. Amazon's product description is very vague in this case, so here are the titles for the individual games:- Arthur's Math Games- Living Books: Stellaluna- Zoombinis Logical Journey- Kid Pix Studio DeluxeThe Zoombinis game is the best one of the bundle. It is relatively tough and requires some adult supervision for the first time around. But after that, a bright 5-year-old should have no problem replaying it on his/her own.Arthur's Math Game, on the other hand, did not run very well. The animation is jerky and pauses often (this is on a new 3GHz Pentium 4 machine). There is appearently a bug in voice reproduction that causes some phrases to be repeated twice.Over all, this is still a very good package, because either one of Zoombini or Kid Pix is already worth the price of purchase."
5,The title track alone would make this album 5 stars.,"Quite arguably the greatest song in Christian music HISTORY, ""The Champion"" has touched so many souls and inspired so many, including myself. The beautifully played out battle between Jesus and Satan will stand as a timeless work of art by one of the greatest singers of the 20th century. If you for some reason have not yet heard this album, please do yourself a life-changing favour and get it as soon as you possibly can."
4,Very Talented. Gotta hear it.,"I must say that as an atheist I find Carman's music quite entertaining. As a christian you will find the message very powerful. Carman has a wonderful voice, and the lyrics really do have a lot of power. As an atheist I simply do not agree, but to those who agree with his beliefs, I must say that you will walk away impressed. I have followed Carman for years and in my opinion, this is by far his best album. A must hear."
4,Ghoulish & catchy garage rock in the vein of NYC's Ramones.,"Groovie Ghoulies were spilled upon the earth from Sacramento, CA. On their early release, Born In The Basement, they find their finest witching hour, mixing witty lyrics and hum-nifty punk-pop melody with a wall of infectious, noisy garage rock. Born In The Basement contains two classic Ghoulie anthems, The Beast With Five Hands and Back To The Garage. Both abound with a spooky-fun charisma that can only be delivered by the Ghoulies. Spinning this Ghoulies disc is like having the Ramones over to your house on Halloween night during a Munsters marathon. Truly, a delectable treat."
3,Chocolate Calendar,This small bound wired booklet is a calender that has a quote about chocolate for everyday of the year. It can be used as a flip book or has a built in stand to be used as a desk calendar. The calendar is generic in that it does not have a year and can be used every year if you so desired.
3,Purchased for the title song,"I'm not a Golden Earring fan, but I am a Byrd's fan. So I was intrigued about GE covering 8 Miles High with a 19 minute version. GE does a nice job with it. They add a few extra lyrics but nothing damaging to the song. The cd only has five tracks, and frankly, the other four aren't bad. If you like the Byrds this CD is worth the cost, as is the Husker Du ep with a punk version of 8 Miles High.Also, check out the Byrds 16 minute version on ""Untitled:"
3,First Golden Earring as we know them.,"After years of pop and Dutch bubblegum,GE tried somethingelse which would be the beginning of the Moontan era(whichwould arrive 4 years(ca. 3 records later)).This is a humble beginning and for completists only.The Byrds*Eight milesHigh* 19 min.long is pretty good."
2,Evolving into Rock Stratos but not quite yet,"I wanted very badly to like this disc but alas after 6 monthsI have to say that it is difficult to listen to with one exception which is 'One Huge Road'. So, I have to agree that it is for completionists and the very curious. The 'Golden Earring' disc is a much more satisfying place to start for me although historically eight miles high did bring them much notoriety. The song Eight Miles High is like a great garage band going on too long for my taste."
4,lanterna does it again,"This could be my favorite of Lanterna's releases. It seems to expand on the cinematic soundscapes of their previous voyages and continue into some new frontier. This album feels like more of a band effort than Lanterna's Sands CD with more drums and bass playing. It lifts you up right from the start and also allows you to drift along with the open vastness that songs like ""Hope"" provide. I'd really like to give it 4.5 stars."
2,Disappointed,"I recently purchased Boomers Workout and was quite disappointed. The DVD claimed this would be a 40 minute workout, but, in fact, the running time is 27 minutes. In doing the routine, I noticed at least 3 times, the screen would say, ""Start set one,"" or ""Start set two"" and in each instance, there was no set two or no set one, respectively. My guess is that about 13 minutes got cut on the editing floor inadvertently. The actual exercises and workout are decent, but the product doesn't meet its claims and participants are not getting the full workout promised. Also, I contacted Funcercise and have never received a reply, which is also disappointing."
5,Great Boomers Weights Exercises DVD. Great Workout.,"Very Good Exercises Workout Routine with Light Weights has Easy Simple Effective Exercises. The DVD is about 35 minutes long which suits me. There is a gentle warm-up, a weights workout routine for the full body including abdominal exercises, a cool down and a nice relaxation segment which laves me feeling very good.The exercises are very clearly explained and first demonstrated by the instructor. Sunshine is always smiling and giving positive suggestions and reminding always to breathe which I catch myself doing. . The DVD is filmed on a beautiful nice sunny beach which makes it very enjoyable to watch.This is a No Chatter No Nonsense Workout routine with weights. Recommended."
2,Not what I expected,"Okay, I'm not new to weight lifting, but was looking for a easy/moderate program. I got this tape a few days ago and did the work out. Beware it's not a work-out being LEAD by the instructor. Its one exercise, directly after the other, no time to get down on the floor, or pick up different weghts. Sunshine and the camera just goes from one scene (and exercise) to the next. There is NO cohesive element -like an instructor presenting a program. Its very oddly put together and well I can't recommend it as a ""work-out."" Its almost disturbing."
2,Too rushed and absolutely HORRIBLE music,"This is supposed to be for Boomers and seniors but how many of us have our own weight benches? The video says you can do these on the floor, but it rushes from one exercise to the next without any break in between, so you have to pause the video, get into position, then unpause it.Probably my biggest complaint though is the absolutely horrid music played in the background. YIKES! This loud acidy rock is so jarring and discordant that I have to mute the soundt, which means I can't get the instructions.All in all, I can NOT recommend this exercise video at all and I'm only glad it was cheap."
5,Easy Workout,"This DVD is unintentionally funny with the strong Jersy accent and perpetual grin of the instructor. The exercise is for people who are very out of shape and at the very beginning of a weight lifting program. This was perfect for me, I was able to do all of the exercises and kept up with no problem. I like the way she shows the exercise first and then does the reps."
3,good work-out,"I had already bought the Bigginers exercise, bbut since I was a baby boomer, decided to get the Boomer's exercise too. Unfortunately, they are exactly the same...boo-hoo"
4,The best explanation of how every body landed here.,"Hawaii is the most multicultural state of the USA, and it was only recently that San Francisco surpassed Honolulu as the most ""majority Minority"" city in the USA (each has upwards of 70% non-caucasian nowadays).At the school of nursing in Honolulu where I teach we emphasize cross cultural awareness and sensitivity. There are terrific books on cross-cultural care ( lipson & Dibble, as well as Pagana & Pagana, come to mind. students are required to buy one or the other of these). BUT, not all ethnic groups present in Hawaii are convered by the books, and there are several variations about semi-acculturated persons form various asian backgrounds who are here.This book, addresses these situations from a health care perspective.The only limitation is, it's getting old and shoudl be reprinted."
1,Very poor quality,"I just received this Panasonic Tape recorder and it literally almost fell apart in my hands. I opened the door to insert a cassette and a spring popped up and fell on the floor. I tried turning the unit on (with fresh batteries), the wheels on the tape ran for a few seconds and then ground to a stop. So I turn it off and try to press play again - only the buttons wouldn't respond at all.So incredibly disappointed. Obviously, I'm sending it back to Amazon as a return for a full refund!"
4,Swinging Piano Trio at it's Best,"Being a jazz pianist, I am a particular fan of the jazz piano trio. This earlier album of Benny Green's is an example of a piano trio at it's best. Contrary to Benny's later albums (kaleidoscope), there are no other instruments on this album. The tunes all swing hard and groove. Benny is one of my favorite comtemporary jazz pianists, and this earlier album shows his developed swinging and exquisite arrangements. I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the jazz piano trio. Also check out Benny's Testifyin' album - especially if you like live albums."
5,Inside Real Life Psychotherapy,"Inside real life psychotherapy - interesting, insightful, and useful. Don't let the academic look of the book fool you -- if you want to learn about how psychoanalytic therapy works, and the potential effect of this therapy, I highly recommend Transforming Lives. The conversational accounts of real-life psychoanalyses as told by the therapists and the patients are very readable, compelling, and down-to-earth.Reading about how the patient's experienced the therapy in their own words was fascinating. For example, one patient wrote about how he tried taking Prozac for 5 years but found it only reduced his anxiety and did not change his life or his personality. In writing about the effect of his psychoanalysis he said: ""Looking over the process, I am somewhat in awe of the changes that have occurred."" He then goes on to explain in detail how the therapy helped him understand himself and change his life. A rare look into the ""two-sided"" process of psychoanalysis."
1,Don't Be Fooled!,"Don't be fooled by all the bells and whistles on this oven like I was. Sure it does a lot of stuff (or at least it says it does) but that doesn't mean it does them well. First, the unit is very lightweight (should have been clue #1). The knobs turn very loosely and are not well marked. The temperature knob is not marked in logical increments; you can't tell where 350 is to save your life! The timing knob is also not well mrked; you don't know if you are setting it for 8 minutes or 12 minutes. I only made toast 2 or 3 times and just had to stand and watch it until it was the way I wanted it and then take it out and shut the timer off. At least shutting the timer off does turn the oven off which I hear does not happen with some ovens and which is why I give it one star. However, I shipped it back to Amazon and ordered something else. I would have expected something like what I got if I had bought it at Wal Mart for $19.99 but not for the price I paid."
4,letter for emily,charming book. loved every thing about this book. could understand grandpa's problem ( my mom has dementia and she is at times trying). i think it was clever to read the poems and figure out what he had to say.
4,Touching story,I enjoyed the book and it seemed like the Alzheimer's was just a side light of the story. In many ways I wish there was more explanation of that. The letters were wonderful but they do get a little tiresome because there are so many. The side story was interesting and the love story was wonderful. My wish would be that every little girl should have a grandfather that loved them that much!
5,Life's Lessons,This is an outstanding book and by far the best book I have read in a long time. I couldn't put it down and will immediately pass it on to a close friend. This book should not be missed. Would that we could all pen poems of life's lessons to pass on to our grandchildren. I often wonder what my grandkids will remember of me.
2,Letters for Emily,"Too predictable and trite for me. There were a few good spots, the best being in the very beginning of the book when Alzheimer's is so vividly described."
4,"Sweet, endearing, and moving","At first, I thought that this book would just be a trite rewriting of ""The Notebook"" except the letters would be to a granddaughter not to the loved one-- which is why I wouldn't not have started the book in first person. But soon it turns into a puzzle book where complex emotions get worked out with the remaining living relatives. Emily, actually was not the main character in this novel. Her parents, who had a crumbling marriage, took front stage. I was glad in the end that Bob wasn't as horrible a person as the entire book made him out to be. The same I couldn't say for Greg- was there Anything redeeming about that man?!Anyway, it was a fast, pleasurable read!"
4,A Wonderful Story of Generations...,"Author Camron Wright has tapped into the differences that divide generations...as well as those that unite them. The link between Emily and Harry--to the relative exclusion of her warring parents--rings so true because the young and the old see life with simple eyes. It's the generation in between that loses sight of the really important things in life. The story develops into one of mystery and intrigue as the letter-writing life of Harry Whitney, which comes to light only after his death, reveals a still-lucid mind in a man who was assumed to be deep in the throes of dementia. The impact of this unexpected legacy will forever redirect the paths of his progeny. Letters for Emily is an excellent read--warm, insightful, thought-provoking."
2,Waste of time,I did not get all the things others did from this book. I am almost done but would rather resell it then finish it. Great concept boring read. I was hoping for so much more.
5,An Amazing Story,"This book is inspirational. There are so many lessons in this book that to just name one would be unjust. A book of loving, learning, and growing, gave me so much joy and pleasure. I will refer to this book many times when the road gets too hard to travel alone. Thank you Harry."
1,Disappointed walker,"The belt clip did not hold the recorder in place. I had to hold the recorder instead of weights as I walked. Sound was good, but the tape recorder stopped working after less than 30 days.Instructions on preset channels difficult to understand. My previous Panasonic recorder lasted eight years. What a disappointment this one is!"
2,Panasonic Useability,"Sounds great, but!!! not user friendly. With batteries removed for recharging all pre-sets are lost. Since there is not a station scan, resetting the presets is cumbersom. Stations seem to stay tuned, but have not tested on the bicycle."
3,"Interesting for adults, but I don't recommend for children","I thought this movie was interesting, as an adult. But I read some reviews before I bought this product, and a lot of parents or grandparents said that they bought this for their children ranging from the ages of 4 and up, I believe. I personally don't see how they could give so much praise about this movie for there children?!? It's very graphic...let's just say, it shows a lot more blood than Chased by Dinosaurs, which hardly shows any and which I did buy for my son and I love that he loves it. Walking With Prehistoric Beasts has some situations, I believe, too volitile and too intense for children. In conclusion, I don't let my son watch it anymore...and I DO NOT recommend this movie for young children. If, as an adult, you would like to watch the movie because your interested in the prehistoric era, I do recommend it. Like i said, it was interesting for me."
5,Walking with Beasts is the best!,"Walking with Beasts is the same as walking with dinosaurs. It has 6 episodes (New Dawn, Whale Killer, Land of Giants, Next of Kin, Sabre Tooth, and Mammoth Journey) and the Triumph of the Beasts. The best in my opinion is Next of Kin. It is a dramatic story of a group of Australopithecus. You know this product is good. If you don't buy it, you're really missing something!"
5,Magificent,"all i can can is ""W O W"" ! What a Awsome flim of anitimation and affects. I watched this show on Discovery Channel Sunday Night Dec 9 and found it fasinating what we evolved from over the millons and millons of years ago."
5,"excellent, if not mystifying!","For those who are fascinated with prehistoric beasts, as I am, you must purchase this video!My friends often comment that I spend too much of my leisure time inundating myself, my thoughts, my being, and my soul with prehistoric beast videos. But, this one is the best ever.After watching it the other night with my other pre-historic beast buddies, Danny, Shaun, and Jacob, I emerged from that viewing with a renewed sense of purpose from the veritable deluge of prehistoric beast anecdotes and tidbits.Indeed, the producer of this video has opened the floodgates of prehistoric beast research and is sure to bathe you in Jurassic delight as you take in the breathtaking imagery that pervades throughout this wonderful video.Be sure to purchase and play this video for YOUR next prehistoric beast party!"
2,Birds get no respect,I don't recall anyone ever saying that the entire Phorusrhacidae was out-competed and driven into extinction by one genus of sabercat. Especially since Phorusrhacos went extinct MILLIONS OF YEARS before Smilodon ever existed.I liked the look of the guys (Phorurhacos) though. And I was impressed that they gave 'em Titanis/Andalgalornis-type wing claws. (Though I'm not sure they would've been that flexible.) But there is no way a nine-foot bird with an axe for a head would be scared away by one cat.
5,A forgotten past..,"When people think of Earth's past, it is usually the dinosaur age of which they think. They tend to forget the fact that the Earth has a huge history of which that Age was only a small part. This encompasses that portion of history often glossed over in favor of the rise of humans, and the very strange and fascinating creatures that existed even before we arrived and existed with us for a time before going extinct. While we might remember the Wooly Mammoth, the Cave Bear and the Saber-toothed Cat, We don't remember the Hyenadon or the Intelidont, or the Gastornis, the monster bird that ate early horses. This is a trip into a topsy turvey world that is strangely fascinating and fills in that gap between the Dinosaurs-and us."
5,Exelente,ExelenteMuy recomendadoBuenisimo lo recomiendo a todos los compradoresBuenisimo lo recomiendo a todos los compradoresBuenisimo lo recomiendo a todos los compradores
2,Not Bulk only 1 bit,"the Bit itself looks to be fine although I have not used it. my complaint is that it says this is Bulk 25 making it seem as if you would get a 25 pack of bits. Well it showed up in a plastic envelope and was 1 bit thrown in the bottom. I thought this was a great deal on a lower quality bit, I needed something for a single use. What I got was 1 bit with the price and shipping that was way to high. I think I could have picked it up at the store for half."
5,Fantastic shoes!,"I run anywhere from 10-20 miles per week, depending on my other activities. I've had these shoes for about 6 weeks now and they have been fantastic.They're light, but they feel solid. There's plenty of room in the toe box, while still maintaining a snug heel fit, and the lace lock system helps keep the midfoot in place. The cushion is good, but not too spongy. The shoes are good of over pronators, but should be fine for nuetral runners as well.My last shoe was a 766, and these are better cushioned, lighter, and have slightly less stability control in them.A great running shoe."
3,Moments of Magic,"Gave very informative, as well as useful applications of how to be a leader in the service industry. I would recommend it for anyone who is looking for ways to train or introduce people to the concept of exceptional service."
4,Diversity of new artists,I have all 14 of the City Folk live albums and lost this one. I am so glad to have it back in my collection. The music has wide variety and all of it excellent. I enjoy being introduced to new artists.
3,Not Her Best,"I completely enjoyed this series so far but, although this one is very readable, it never got off the ground for me. I would have preferred more about the kidnapping and much less about the fires. Kind of a lazy effort, I thought, particularly the ending which had me shaking my head in disappointment. Hope the next one is better."
4,entertaining read,"This was my first Elizabeth Chase PI book. Kidnapping of 4-yr old child from wealthy community plus arson (out of control fires that destroyed communities and took lives) entertwined. Since this is fiction, I would like to have had a little more psychic adventure in the book. Overall, the book was very entertaining and was one of the few that I've read in the last year that I didn't turn to the back to see if the end justified reading the entire book. Martha's characters are on the whole well developed and believable. There was one glaring ""technical"" error that was well into the book. Was surprised that it got past both the author and publisher. I will make an effort to read more of this series."
5,Awsome Stuff!,"This album is one of the finest Jazz-Funk-Swing albums out there. Every song (except for one ballad) is a groove that will make your ears very happy. My personal favorite is track 4, Aw Shucks where Lonnie Smith makes the hammond organ scream....it gives me the shivers every time. I cant reccomend this album enough...it is a must have for anyone that remotley likes this type of music."
3,A thoughtful gift,I bought these Dearfoams Men's Microterry Clog with Memory Foam as a Christmas present for my daughter's boyfriend. He remarked it was a thoughtful gift.
2,Beware of Sizing!,"These are really nice slippers, but beware of the sizing! I ordered a size 9M for my husband who wears a size 9 shoe. They were WAY TOO SMALL. In fact, they just fit me and I wear a size 7-1/2 to 8 narrow in women's shoes! It's not worth it to send them back to Amazon. The shipping to get them back for a refund would probably be near the purchase price, so I'm just keeping them for myself. Only problem, I had to take my husband to J.C. Penney & buy ANOTHER pair of slippers for him. So, I ended up paying for 2 pair of slippers instead of one. I would allow AT LEAST 2 ADDITIONAL SIZES when ordering these slippers for your guy!"
3,review,"i am wearing them now...look at the picture they have no ankle support. however, they are worth the price and a solid lounge shoe for indoor and the occasional walk to the mail box."
2,Not the best pair,"These are not the best pair of memory foam slippers in terms of practical use. Initially, it was comfortable but within 3 or 4 days, the foam seems to have lost its strength.The stitching of the cloth on the inside is very very poor. Mine is coming out after about 2 weeks of use.I saw a pair in Bed Bath & Beyond for $10 (the ones you see on TV..white color). I actually like those better than these Dearfoams."
1,I sent these slippers back!!,"The soles on these slippers are so thin that I could feel the floor beneath my feet. It felt as if I was wearing socks not slippers; they offered so little insulation my feet were cold all the time. The picture suggests that the sole is thick, but do not be fooled, it is very thin."
4,cozy slippers,"These slippers do keep your feet warm, very warm, and the soft material is very comfortable. However the bottom of the slippers scuff up non-carpeted surfaces and make a mess in my kitchen."
3,It's O.K.,"I'm a fan of Dearfoams, these aren't the best, but they are not the worse. I keep them around if I go outside. Not as much cushioning as I like."
2,flipflop,slipper support is wonderfull BUT it needs a higher back around the heal.that way the back of the heal won't slip sideways as you walk. also a higher back will keep the slipper on when you back up.
5,Just what he wanted,"My oldest son is 12. He's at that in between stage where he's big enough to wear men's yet some of his tastes are younger, yet not little-kiddish. That's a tough age to shop for. He liked the look of these and said they're very comfortable. I like the tread so I don't have to yell at him when he wears them outside ----- kids don't worry about ruining socks or slippers like Moms do. =)"
4,good product,Had a difficult time finding a replacement slipper for my husband.This has the memory foam which he prefers. It runs on the small size. He wears a 9 1/2 or 10 and I purchased a 12 so his heal wouldn't hit the back of the slipper like the size 10 I bought at Penney's. Has a nice sole so he can go get the paper. I would buy this item again.
4,Great slippers!,"I bought these for my husband for the holidays and he loves them! They are very soft and very comfortable on his wide feet. The color is a nice, rich royal blue, which is his favorite color.His only complaint is that, while the soles are well-made, they are made of hard plastic and prone to slipping."
5,The best book yet by this excellent author,"I first discovered Julia Watts in an Appalachian literature class with Wildwood Flowers. We all liked it so well we went and bought them all! This one is the best one yet. It falls slightly in the Southern Gothic style as Lily, a lesbian children's book author is forced to marry and move to rural Georgia to save the child she had with her dead lover.As always with Watts the characterization is amazing and the book is sidesplittingly funny. Anyone who buys Fanny Flagg should go after Julia Watts. I think people are turned off by the press, don't be. Julia Watts merits your attention now and Wedding Bell Blues is an American classic."
3,Nice little rock n roll record.,"Golden Earring are definitely a fan's band. They put out a LOT of albums, but all anybody seems to remember are the songs ""Radar Love"" and ""Twilight Zone"". Fans of the band who dug deeper and checked out their other releases quickly discovered two things. 1: This is a good little rock band, with a lot more to offer than just a couple of singles. 2: They are awesome in concert.The live renditions of the two ""big hits"" are far superior to the overplayed studio versions (""Radar Love"" is played so heavy that it sounds like a completely different band). Plus, the opening track ""Long Blonde Animal,"" is just plain fun. It's actually the reason I tracked this one down, and is worth the price of the disc alone."
2,never buy a cheap vcr.,"The minute I took it out of the box I had my doubts. The case is made of flimsy, superlight plastic. ""But it's what's inside that counts."" I told myself, ""after all it's a Sylvania"". Ran okay for a couple days, then just snow, no picture. This was especially disappointing as the hi-fi sound was discernably better than my old mono sets, and the light up remote was a real nice touch. I had high hopes for this unit--despite miserable performance, I liked enough things about to almost consider buying another one, in fact, I had ordered another just after getting this one--will probably try it out real well before I decide whether or not to keep it."
1,Avoid this highly returnable item,"This item made video fade in and out. I can understand blocking the signal from recording copyrighted material without the fade, but I don't want to see it when it is passing throught the VCR to the TV. Also the menu is less than intuitive and the remote awful"
1,"Just say ""no""",I bought one of these (from another source) and it immediately started to eat tapes. I don't recommend it at all.
2,Bought and return it at another store,"It worked for three days and then the video stoped. All I got was sound when playing a video tape. The on screen programing could be viewed, but no video from tapes. I would not recommend. I returned it and I'm still looking. Good luck!"
3,Speedo Demons,"I first saw ""Leeches"" and then ""Speed Demon"". After seeing the first film, I knew damn well that the second one wasn't going to be any better. What I did enjoy seeing was the beefy young men that graced the screen in both films. It made me almost forget the lousy plot lines and horrible acting. I was especially impressed with Jared Edwards, the actor who looks like a dark haired version of model/actor Travis Fimmel (Tarzan). In fact, I thought it was Travis until I saw the closing credits. Collin Stark is also enjoyable to look at. To cut this review short, if you are looking for ""Speed Demon"" to be an action packed and suspenseful movie, then you'll be disappointed. If you are tuning in to see some hot bodies in little clothing, then you'll be pleased as punch. I gave this movie a 3 star rating just for that."
2,David Decocteaus worse film yet!,"I have seen almost all of David Decocteaus films, and I am a huge fan of The Brotherhood Trilogy, Voodoo Academy, and The Frightening. However, his last 3 releases have been huge disappointments. Lacking all the pieces that made his first films so campy and enjoyable. His films starting with Leeches have gotten worse and worse. His latest is Speed Demon. His so called version of The Fast and the Furious with some horror, and barley clad men thrown in there. The plot is rediclulous. The acting atrocious. The charaters names are hysterical! Clutch, Wiper, all different parts of a car. The plot goes nowwhere, and the film goes along so slowly that you don't even care who the killer is. Let me tell you,there is a twist, but its pretty obvious who it is, if you can pay attention long enough. Fans of David Decocteau may find this film enjoyable, especially for the beefy men in their underwear, but they certainly won't make one of their favorites."
3,Speed Demon,i just love about all david's movies. this had a little better story andsome very good/gorgeous eye candy for viewers.
1,Just like The Fast and Furious except with more homoeroticism.,"Speed Demon is a terrible film. A gay version of The Fast and Furious. There's only three women in this film and they wear more clothes than the guys. The dudes worship an engine block and they like to smear ""motor oil"" on each others chest while they play ring around the roses wearing nothing but jockeys and socks. Dude there is nothing cool about this movie. To quote the director in the commentary sums up the entire movie,""I don't like guns or violence, this is the last time I'll use one in a movie.""The movie is only 70 minutes long (with credits and padded out scenes). One part of the movie that troubled me was when the ""hero"" and his girl were having ""sex"". The girl's bra remained on the entire time. Who in the hell does that?More camera molestation from David DeCoteau. He makes Victor Salva's films seem straight.Bad stuff, avoid like the plague."
1,What is this?!,"It this a quadruple feature or a pentagle feature? The DVD title and the DVD picture do not go together!! Highly misleading. I would buy if it was the TITLE, but I don't want it if it's what the PICTURE represents. Can anyone help me out?"
1,Gayest movie ever,"What a disappointment. A bunch of guys walking around with no shirts on and rubbing each other with motor oil so a speed demon will make them drive fast. Where are these sissy boys going in such a hurry, to their boyfriends house? Sick crap that I could not sit through."
3,"Uneven and teasing, but contains gems","The theme is right up my alley and Lethem is one of my favorite authors. Nevertheless I found the book frustrating, because many of the pieces are excerpts from novels and show it, with abrupt endings that don't resolve anything. I'm grateful for having the chance to get tastes of these (mostly obscure) books, but it detracts from the anthology itself. Nevertheless, thanks to this I've already discovered, purchased and read two excellent novels I'd never heard of before -- Lawrence Shainberg's ""Memories Of Amnesia"" (first person view of eminent neurologist's mental collapse) and John Franklin Bardin's ""The Deadly Percheron"" (weirdo '40s noir) -- and in between enjoyed some old classics I hadn't re-read in a while, such as Philip K Dick's terrifying SF short story ""I Hope I Shall Arrive Soon""."
3,Hardly cohesive,"While this book contains many wonderful short stories, it fails at being a cohesive anthology. Editor Lethem has broadly defined 'amnesia' define anything related to the doubt of one's mental state or existence. That's wide net, and the resulting catch is eclectic and disjointed.I also have a problem with the excerpts from full novels. Although many stand well on their own, I always feel as if I'm not getting the full point. Once I was halfway through I began skipping the excerpts and focused on the complete short stories.But as I said, there are many gems here. Particulary the Borges, Lethem, and Sacks stories stand out. If you read this with the understanding that most of the stories have nothing to do with the common perception of amnesia, it may be well worth your time."
4,Mmmm... yummy.,"Are you worried that coughing up the bucks for an anthology will leave you with two or three gem stories and a pile of duds? Well don't worry this time, kids, Lethem delivers the goods. At least eight solid keepers in this one that I will certainly read again at some point. Overall, the theme works very well, and the variety of experiences (from creepy to wacky) is pretty wide. It's not all bumps on the head, waking up in white-walled rooms..."
4,Fuhgeddaboutit,"As others have commented, this collection is uneven but Lethem has done an admirable job in assembling a diverse collection of modern authors, mainly in the realm of fiction. Unfortunately, some of the approaches and themes are repetitious, leading one to confuse many of the plots with each other (how many times must a man wake up and wonder where he is and why he has no memory of his past?). However, some stand-out pieces from JL Borges, LJ Davis, Philip K Dick, Julio Cortazar and Robert Sheckley demonstrate that a simple theme can lead to surprisingly disparate approaches. Overall a worthwhile purchase for the 400 pages of mind-bending literature it contains."
3,"Some great stories, some so-so","When I saw this at a bookstore, I had to have it, being a big fan of that cheesiest of all literary and cinematic devices, amnesia.Most of these stories were new to me, except for the Donald Barthelme's ""Game,"" and some are great, such as Philip K. Dick's ""I Hope I Will Arrive Soon,"" Brian Fawcett's ""Soul Walker,"" and particularly a nonfiction entry from Oliver Sacks, ""The Last Hippie."" I did not care at all for ""Sarah Canary,"" or ""The Second Coming."" Many of these ""stories,"" are actually excerpts, which now makes me want to read Cornell Woolrich's ""The Black Curtain"" and ""Cowboys Don't Cry"" by L.J. Davis. Still, I have to say the best thing in the whole book is Lethem's introduction. After that, the book itself was a bit of a letdown. Still, I'm glad I bought it and I look forward to going through the books listed in his ""Incomplete Annotated Bibliography of Amnesia Fiction."""
4,Its a Mad Mad Mad World !!!!,"..I feel stupid , its something that comes and goes "" "" Life is changing..its funny how no one knows ""Rob Soars out Loud and is as always truimphiant !. Delivering such powerful vocals and lyrics leaving your ears infectious and begging and pleading for more !.Mad Season - The Title song representing the entire mad collection of hits featured in the album , truly justifys its name.A Pure Rock track with heavy percussion and loud electric guitars enough to make you jump out of your car seat and sing along in the traffic.Rob Thomas et all are great musicians. Its a shame that such good songs are not being air played often.Anyways..if you're a matchbox twenty fan. You know exactly what you have to do. For those who are only familiar with the band name..Pick up this single..Take my word..you'll be buying the albums too."
2,The Worse cut from the CD,"I just can't understand why they picked this cut to be released for the next single .""Angry,Crutch,"" or my favorite number,""You won't be mine,"" would have been perfect."
3,Heading towards the light and fluffy elevator style jazz....,"....but not there yet. I prefer the deep funk of Byrd's ""Ethiopian Knights"", but ""BlackByrd"" has grown on me considerably. On my first listen I was taken by surprise because I wanted more ""Little Rasti"" and I put this away for a long time. I've been listening to it now for a few weeks straight and it's laid back summertime groove has consumed my soul. ""Street Lady"" has the same vibe, so I picked it up to, but I will have to stop there and dig on all the great Byrd I have. It seems after Street Lady the music got really really light and fluffy. Snore...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Go get ""Fancy free"", ""Electric Byrd"", ""Ethiopian Knights"", ""BlackByrd"" & ""Street Lady"" and you will have the funkiest of Donald Byrd and the best in my opinion."
4,One of the pieces is a greatly moving homage to George Adams,"This album includes an exceptionally beautiful composition, ""Ah George, We Hardly Knew Ya"", which is an homage to the late George Adams. In this piece, a gentle latin ballad, Carlos Ward and Don Pullen play with such depth of emotion that all the considerations of commercial success, entertainment or showmanship that usually plague musical performance seem suspended, leaving space for a vibrant communion between the leaving artists and the dead one, with such evidence that the listener also becomes a participant in that communion."
5,A Haunting Read,"Lucille Morrow has it all. She is a very well-to-do suburban housewife, with a loving husband, children, a gracious home, money, jewels and the beauty of her youth.What is it that takes her into a fatal plunge down in a spiraling madness?Margaret Millar spun (in 1945, no less!) a horrific gothic of autenthic ghosts and how the shadows of the past will never let go. As usual with this author, the ending is a gem."
2,Not happy,"I looked at reviews on this and purchased it. I recieved the package , sounded like it was all broken. Very poor packing by manufacturer NOT Amazon. I returned it and I am currently searching for another."
3,Decent,"For a 4 dollar flashlight, its okay but I just got it today and turned it on and its not nearly as bright as I thought it would be. Its something that you would buy from a dollar store. It does work so I guess thats a plus but the way the seller describes it isn't so accurate and can be very misleading. Not for camping, walking dog, blackout, etc, its more for opening up your house door at night."
3,3 batteries,the metal case is nice but the fact that it takes 3 batteries makes it a bit heavy for it's size ... the LED light is bright but I'm not sure how long the batteries will last.
3,Bright but okay..,"The LED is bright and it works great, but the part where you put the batteries in doesn't screw in all the way. It screws in enough for it to work but doesn't seem to fit all the way. Either way, it works."
1,Very poor quality,"This flashlight only lasted a few weeks. It was dead even though new batteries were used. In overall, I only used it about 10 times and 1-5 minutes each time. It was a total waste of money. Please do not make the same mistake as I did.Cheap doesn't mean a good deal if it wouldn't last for a reasonable amount of time."
4,Very bright but it flickers,"I ordered this small flashlight to put in my desk at work for any power outages that we might have. It's very compact and bright which is perfect. However, it tends to flicker a lot once you have it on for a few minutes which is very annoying. This would be a perfect flashlight if the beam stayed strong all the time."
3,Does it job but cheaply made,This started out as a good item but now the end cap comes loose and you often have to tighten it or wiggle it in order to get it to turn on. Since it is LED the batteries do last for a long time and the flashlight does have a heavy duty professional feel to it.
1,"Not a good design, others are the same price but better quality...","This light has an interior battery compartment that is larger than the the battery carrier by about 1/8 inch. The battery carrier rattles loosely inside. No connections are maintained thus no light:<(. The wristlet arrived cut in two. The edges of the hole that is was attached through we're not smoothed in the machining process. Left sharp, they just sliced right through the line during shipping. The return policy is solid and they are paying my return shipping...which is higher than the cost of the flashlight. Oh well."
2,"Has its uses, but overall pathetically bad history.","Steeped in British-Israelist presumption and annoyingly repetitive in its insistence in seeing ""divine guidance"" every time someone notable in American history so much as belched, this volume is easy to read, but also a very good example of what little or no real research on your subject will produce. McNair's ""history"" repeats historical fable and falsehood without the slightest hint that the author did anything more than consult a library book here and there. Its only clear positive is that the chapters do flow from one to the next well enough that one isn't lost in a lot of dates and pieced-together information."
1,Bad Sound,"The front loading cd it's cool, the full logic tape it's ok, but the sound it's AWFUL,light bass,low volume, bad quality,distortion. I recomend you hear this box in the store and then you decide,( mine was a gift)."
2,Totally disappointed in this product!!,"Hey all you electronics fans- read this carefully before you decide to purchase this item. This appears to be a great little boombox- with the panasonic name and everything and all the features- like you get a remote with it. However, i've mostly bought Aiwa stereos and boomboxes my whole life and so in comparison to the quality of Aiwa which was all i really had to go on, i gave this product only 2 stars. Its ok IF your not concerned with crystal clear sound quality. And the other thing i didn't like is that it only goes so loud...and i wanted it louder! Remote was ok, but keys were fairly tiny & a little hard to see. I decided to ship this one back and compare Aiwa to sony, and although i love Aiwa, i found the best and most powerful sound i've ever heard from the Sony CFD-ZW755. You WON'T be disappointed, believe me. I am the biggest skeptic there is when it comes to quality and sound. I'd rethink this one if i were you."
3,Hoola hoop disappointment,The seller sent this item with lightening speed & it is very nice except the hoola-hoop is huge and because it is so big it flops around.They need to consider making the hoop smaller so you don't have to be outside to do it...its un-useable...made well but not practical!
3,Okay but not exactly what was pictured,"I just got this spotted wobbegong and I have to say that is okay but not quite the value that I paid. Also in the picture it looks much more gray (like a real wobbegong) but in real life is quite green. If you want accuracy, this might not be the best. But if you just want some sturdy for the kids to play with then this would be okay. I expect better from Schleich though."
4,Hardie Review for Bader,"The Bader Reading and Language Inventory is an excellent resource for literacy coaches and special education teachers. My copy arrived in excellent condition. A few things I would have liked to have seen in the 6th edition would be to have the individual forms to record student performance and the reader's selections on the enclosed DVD. The process of continually making copies from the book is both tedious and time consuming and due to print size in the book one needs to enlarge as well. As a middle school literacy coach, my time is both precious and limited.Bader Reading & Language Inventory (6th Edition)"
2,More of a workbook,"This book isn't so much a book for reading as a book to get word lists and reading passages out of. From the standpoint of a math teacher, it's useless, except as a required book for a grad class.If you are an elementary teacher, then the worksheets, surveys, word lists, and reading passages could be useful."
2,Dont go for this book!,"I didn't like this book. This book is more of do-this-and-do-that book. I would recommend maya 4.5 savvy which is more of a why-this-happens-when-you-do-this book..this book just is simple and tells us everything. There is no challenge in it. Not to mention it doesnt really talk much about the inner workings of the program..Maya Savvy actually explains us the stuff. Sometimes, the exercises in that book are a bit tricky, but that atleast means that they dont pamper you. They actually teach you the stuff right!I hope this helps people make the RIGHT decision!"
2,average but Catchy,"thsi track reminds me in parts of Marvin Gaye,Earth,Wind&Fire&Tone Loc amongest other folks.it was a Catchy Cut but fairly Average on a whole&unlike past Outkast First Cuts off there New Albums this cut was just kinda there."
1,Really bad,Terrible movie for low level brains not well doneI thought info would have quality was badlydisappointed I would not recommend
2,"same 'ol, same 'ol","This video is great for someone just getting into these subjects.. Some interesting information. However I was quite disappointed as there was nothing new, nothing I hadn't heard before. Since it is a fairly recent video I expected a lot more. Especially from E.Tolle who was probably the most disappointing.So if this is all new to you enjoy! If you have spent a lifetime studying, you can find much better sources, such as ""I AM"", by Tom Shadyak, ""The Healing Matrix"", which ""Seems"" like, but is not a continuation of ""I AM"". These other videos contain a lot of new knowledge and research. Well worth it."
5,Interesting!,I found this video interesting and has a very positive message. Worth it! Now it is just a matter of following through on the suggestions for a better life.
4,Everything I had hoped for,"I ordered this cd after seeing Joe Firstman live on accident (opened for Jewel, I had never heard of him before)...and fell in love with his music! This cd is everything I had hoped for-heartfelt, gritty at times, soulful, sweet, and rockin', and the best part is I like every single song on it (which is usually hard to find). I must say, although this cd is excellent-he is MUCH better live...just him and his guitar. But, I think that's true with any great performer. I give this album two thumbs up!"
5,Lightyears beyond,"I saw Joe Firstman open for Michelle Branch at the Virgin College Tour, and he was so amazing that I ran out during intermission to buy this album at his table outside the concert hall. Lyrically, the songs are astoundingly touching and musically, Joe is lightyears beyond my (other) favorite artists. He puts you into such a smooth groove that you never want him to stop playing."
5,Great Talent,Saw Joe in concert and was hooked on his unique style and songwriting. Powerful vocalist and musician. Every single song on the CD is great!
5,It is about time...,"Finally... I'm 48 years old and I grew up in a time where songwriters were true artists. They were true to their souls, and still knew how to get you out of your seat. This guy is a young star just waiting to shine. I saw him open up for Sheryl Crow ""by accident"" in Sioux City, and I was so impressed, I took the whole next week off and travelled across the country to see him three more times. He is a true gem to the rock-n-roll world. I picked this album up last week and it is truly one that will go down in history. I'm so thrilled I got to see him on his way up!"
3,Open House Distorted Talk,"Great Jimmy Smith sessions with 2 outstanding sax men, Ike Quebec and Jackie McLean. Content is 4 or 5 stars but the sound quality is 1 star, terribly distorted (microphone stage overload) on most of the horn work. This must be the reason this one has never been given the RVG treatment. Too bad."
4,A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY !!!!!!!,Just a little in the bottle and it yields a lot!!!! I choose to sprout broccoli seeds the most because they are one of the most nutritiously dense foods even more so than broccoli itself.
5,Yum,I am not sure why these are so hard to find these days. Something about spoiled sprouts in the store I guess but these are fantastic!
2,Mold!,I have sprouted four batches of seeds from this order. Two of the four devloped a mold during the third day. I have been sprouting for a few years. I know the steps needed to prevent this type of problem but the issue still is there.
3,Its a dud,"I was somewhat disappointed upon weighing my ""sack of seeds"" because even with the heavy (thick plastic) bag and tie it was still an ounce shy and everyone knows you don't weigh product with the bag on the scale unless you have accounted for the weight of the bag. After contacting the vendor she relented and sent me ""one"" ounce. At first I got a high proportion of ""duds"" (about 1/3 to 1/4) but I did some experimenting and now I seem to be getting results. I don't know if my case is normal but the vendor seemed slightly irritated by my request. Maybe others will have better luck."
4,Good Value,"This combo unit has many quality features for the price, and the performance is excellent (so far). My negative criticism would have to be that the buttons on the face of the unit could have a more durable feel... And they could include an antenna... And why don't they just make it a 4-head VCR instead of a 2-head since the Sylvania 4-head VCR's are priced so cheaply already? Still, all negativity aside, this unit is performing well for my family, and I am rather pleased. Four out of five stars."
4,As expected,"I have more than half of the volumes of this series. Volume 21 was exactly what I expected. The copy I received was in new condition, and arrived very promptly."
4,My Thoughts (for whatever they're worth),"Janusz Skulski's second contributation to the ""Anatomy of the Ship"" series, I thought that this was a bit more polished than the ""Yamato"" volume. These two books together are one of the best English-language resources (that I am aware of) for WWII Japanese navy vessels. This book has everthing; from profiles of the ship as it appeared in its career, down to the rivet patterns used to assemble the hull, all in scaled drawings."
2,Useless,A little deception on the seller's part & improper reviews made me buy this... fill in the blank. I wanted a filter mostly for dust removal but what I got was something for odor removal. I see dust particles actually dancing in front of & around this filter. I just stand there watching as it vents & disturbs dust & other allergens already settled on the walls flying freely over everything. I just wanted something to turn on o'ernite to help with the cleaning next day. Guess I'll keep looking.
3,Quiet Release,"Well this album kind of slipped out there quietly. It sounds much like other Foo Fighter albums, though I think they miss Pat at times. The writing seems to have gotten a little stale, a little predictable. Overall this is a good album that rocks, but it doesn't match up to their debut or the Colour and the Shape."
3,GOOD...,"The great Dave Grohl, is one of those musicians I came to associate with, growing up during that grunge-era, Nirvana golden years. For me, the perfect combination of his and Kurt's voice, his musicianship, even attitude clearly defined what was Nirvana. Learning to Fly, was excellent plus the funny video, which was like FF's signature, just watch Low. I find Walking After You, amazing and who could forget that poignant video. True, this album have gems, the explosive, All My Life, cool, Times Like This, and the unexpected, Come Back(which is very long....). The rest were totally generic ones (or fillers, so they say).Still, there's the voice, the musicianship and the attitude, that makes Dave Grohl, one of the best if not the best mucian there is."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I have always been a fan of the Foo Fighters,but their new album just doesn't cut it. I thought it might get better after listening to it a few times,but there isn't much on the disc that makes me want to hear it again. I personally don't think that there is one song on this album that matches the quality of other great Foo Fighters songs released in the past. I was really surprised to be disappointed by this CD because i had read very positive reviews about it. Oh well,everyone has their own opinions..."
5,Excellent Album,"The Foo Fighters are one of the few bands who have been able to maintain their original sound. While their debut album wasn't anything spectacular, they showed what they're made of with 'The Color And The Shape', their second album. 'One by One' retains the hard rock style from that and is overall a great collection of songs, also featuring some more 'silent' songs in the style of 'Everlong'. Anyone who liked TC&TS and 'There Is Nothing Left To Lose' will definitely like One by One.The bonus DVD that comes with some versions also have videos of 'The One' and 'Walking A Line', two more great songs."
5,Peter Vodogaz - you are wrong!,"The Foo Fighters are not from Australia, you twit! I'm from Sydney and even I know that Dave Grohl was the drummer from Nirvana and the boys are US born and bred. They love coming here and playing, but make no mistake, they are not Australian.They rock."
4,Hmmm,"More like 3.5.So. Half of this album is excellent. The rest is filler. But, due to ""Times Like These"", ""All My Life"", Disenchanted Lullaby (the intro irritates me but it gets better), ""Have It All"" (kinda sappy but I love the intro), ""Low"" (have you SEEN the video?) and ""Overdrive"" (again, kinda sappy but there's something about it I love), the album is pretty enjoyable. It doesn't compare to the first three, but it has its moments. The riffs are slightly heavier, most songs are pretty upbeat. ""Times Like These"" is an instant classic with awesome lyrics, while ""All My Life"" rocks harder than pretty much all previous songs. Kinda sucks how the best songs are/were singles, but if they had released other songs, no-one would buy the album. Mind you, my friend loves ""Burn Away"", so listen to the previews and make your own mind up."
2,Tiresome,"This album is so bland and uninspired. People act like the Foo Fighters went in some new no nonsense hard rock direction on this album. Well let me tell you they didn't. This is just the same as thier other albums, POP! Bad tiresome pop at that. Dave is a good drummer but his band sucks."
2,Just can't get into it,"Try as I might, this album has failed to take hold of me like Colour and the Shape and There is Nothing Left to Lose. Those albums had plenty of raw, emotional energy, feeling, and soul to them. As much as I wanted to like this album, it feels very sterile, slick, and not nearly as deep as the previous two efforts.I think Dave is starting to mellow out, unfortunately. I know he said at the Grammy's that he wrote this whole album for Jordan, and I think that may have negatively impacted it. Sorry to be such a killjoy, but it's just the way I feel. Dave is one of my musical idols and I think he's awesome, but this album just pales in comparison to the others in the catalog."
5,Most rocking since their debut,"You won't find any 'Aurora' or 'Walking After You' kind of songs on this album, the closest is 'Tired of You' which is a slow, dark song. The album starts off in a burst of energy with great songs like 'All My Life,' 'Low,' 'Have It All' and 'Times Like These.' 'Low' is my personal favourite with the pounding drums and crashing guitars. The album slows down very much after these and, in all honesty, I think they should have replaced 'Overdrive' and 'Burn Away' with 'Normal' (b-side) and 'Walking A Line' (from the DVD).I still love the album though even though those two are the weakest songs I think the Foo Fighters have done. The other songs make up for it, like 'Disenchanted Lullaby,' 'Lonely As You' and 'Halo'. 'Come Back' is a great way to finish the album with an 8 minute closer."
5,who needs Levitra?,"This album is a drug-free cure for erectile disfunction. I have had no problems performing since I bought this album.It rocks so hard, that it makes me rock hard."
4,"""Times Like These!!!!!!""","This song,""Times like these,"" is one of the best songs I've ever heard. I have been unfamiliar with the Foo Fighters until a friend recently introduced me to this song. I absolutely love it! Since it is currently my favorite song, i would definately recommend it to everyone who loves catchy lyrics and tunes!!!!"
4,In the pouring rain,"I have always liked the Foo Fighters, but never bought their CDs. I saw them this past weekend at Memphis In May and in the torrential rain, wind, freezing cold, 6 inches of mud- they put on a fantastic show. They absolutely ROCKED!Bought this CD afternoon, it's great-"
5,Awesome,"After the huge success of There is Nothing Left to Lose Foo Fighters are back doing what they do best rock hard and also make great music. In my opinion this album is alot better than their last album. All My Life is a great opener it biulds up into a heavy rockin' intense song with slammin guitar sounds and drum beats. Low is a very similar style to Queens of the Stone Age. Have it All features sweet but punchin vocals by Dave Grohl mixed in with heart poundin guitar and drums. Other highlights are Tired of You with Queen guitarist Brian May. Other stand outs Halo, Lonely as you. The rest is a feast of pure hard rock and the Foo's signature style.One by One is one of this years stand out Albums. The bonus DvD is excellent with the clip All My Life and Walking the Line which is not on the album, how do you get a copy of that song?"
4,good,"this cd is really good. at first i didnt like it and i'm not sure why, but as i have listened to it i've grown to like it. i, personally, at this point, do not think its as good as color and the shape. it still is DEFINITLY worth the money to buy."
4,"Foo Figher Goodness, Yet nothing real special.","I love the Foo Fighters. I have been waiting for this release for some time now. I think my expectations for this album were a little too high. I just went out and bought it an hour ago and I'm happy with the sound. The Foo Fighters never fail to produce quality songs. I especially like ""Come Back."" The mix of new guitar sounds and riffs gives it an awesome feel to end the album with. The only down side to this cd, is from the first play through it, it felt monotone and almost weak. It feels like some foo fighter spark is missing from many of the songs and they tend to just blur together. Foo Fighter songs always grow on me, so I'm sure my opinion will change. Overall if you like the Foo Fighters, get this cd. If not, this might be something different for you."
4,Foo Fighters,"Good overall CD, but needed more like All My Life because that is my favorite song on the CD. Some of the other songs are good, but my favorite is All My Life. But if you like the Foo Fighters I would really recommend you get it! I am a big fan so I like it alot. It also comes with a cool DVD, so if you like the Foo Fighters and like some of their slower songs than this album is for you."
3,does their first single sound familiar?,"that's because it just a pumped-up rocker version of the violent femmes' ""add it up"".i admit...i am a bit biased due to that fact...the album isn't too shabby...but nothing special. this one's going back to the used-cd bin of the record store."
2,one only one - good song,"All my life is a great song. It sets the precedent for the rest of the album, which unfortunately does not live up to an inkling of what the first song delivers. This album gets progressively worse as the songs go by. All of their other albums as albums are better than this one. I wanted to love it, but I don't. I still keep listening, hoping that the umpteenth time around will be better, but it isn't, no matter how many times I listen."
4,Foo Fighters back on track!,"THE FOO FIGHTERS are one of the best bands going, but since the sublime album ""The colour and the shape"" their music has slightly gone downhill. Their third album ""There is nothing left to loose"" was good, but not what I expected. Thank god FOO FIGHTERS are back on track again! From the beginning with the hard rock hit ""All my life"" to the end with the progressive rock song ""Come back"". Other great tracks include the catchy ""Have it all"" and the beautifull ""Times like these"". The melodies are fantastic, and the lyrics are superb, to altogether make a brilliant album."
4,Good - ish,"I am a more than dedicated Foo Fighters fan and even more so a Dave Grohl fan, but, this album did disapoint me. I knew it would be different to their old stuff but i thought it would be better than the others. I still stand by the fact that their first album - self titled, was the best of all time, closely followed by the colour and the shape but they will struggle to get any better. Don't get me wrong this doesn't mean that i am no longer a foos fan, i am just disappointed. Their are a few really good songs though."
5,Just a incredible record,"""All My Life,"" the gritty and powerful first track of the Foo Fighters fourth album immediately knocked my socks off. And why wouldn't it? The song's contrasting quiet/loud scheme just works so well. The next two songs, ""Low"" and ""Have it All,"" show off the Foo's great guitar riffs along with soft, passionate growlings by Grohl. A real gem on the album is ""Tired of You,"" aided with the help of the one and only Brian May, which contrasts well with the upbeat-sound of ""Halo."" My personal favorite, ""Lonely as You,"" is deliciously good. I can't even explain it. `One by One' sadly leaves us wanting more with the last track, ""Come Back,"" yet another epic song by the Foo's. Overall, `One by One' is a very consistent and very complete rock record, easily the best of the year. Oh, and super cool too. `One by One' and the Foo Fighters definitely lived up to my expectations, saving rock music once again. I urge anyone and everyone to buy this record immediately."
5,A refreshing taste of great music.,"This album, in a word, rocks. Good music is hard to come by these days. And when a band you have always loved is FINALLY coming out with a new album (after years of waiting) you cant help but get a little nervous. So when I heard news of the foofighters new release... under all of the excitement was that little voice asking ""what if its not as good as the last?"" Oh but this one is. From start to finish the album is amazing. and the best part of this album (and in typical foofighters style) every song has its own life. Its refreshing to finally hear an album that actually has a heart to it. An album where you can hear the actually talent of actual musicians. So much thanks to the foofighters for producing an album that I could listen to FOREVER.=)"
3,What is so appealing about the Foos??,"meh. Its an ok album. A bit repetative thou. Too much airplay for All My Life and Times Like These (both mediocre songs). Im sorry if ive offended the long time Foo Fighters fans,but there is NO WAY that this album is interesting enough to deserve 4 or 5 stars.. There's nothing much special about Foo Fighters.. sorry guys"
2,a grammy for the foo fighters...,"The foo fighters have just won a grammy for best hard rock album, does'nt that tell you somethings gone horribly wrong?Well if that does'nt then keep on listening to straight forward formula rock....sorry nothing new on this record. Dont get me wrong I absolutely love the foo's previous records its just that I think they could have done so much better."
4,well 3 and a half,"THis is a good album. But not great. I am a huge foo fan but i found this album is lacking. Not enough really catchy songs like the other 3 records. I think what would ahve really boosted this record commercially is if it contained the song the one that they did for orange county as that is better than most the stuff on one by one and was already a hit single. SO i suggest buying the colour and the shappe if you want a great foo cd, if you just want some kick ass music pick up the new pearl jam album (which i know you will like if you dig the foos). Hopefully one by one will grow on me, but till then i cant wait to see them at the big day out 03, see ya in the pit!"
4,nirvana,"this is pretty good, dave grohl is very talented, but i do think that nirvana is way better then the foo fighters, but dave grohl definetly makes this bad awesome. If you like the foo fighters, then you could like nirvana, but they are definetly not alike, foo fighters is not as heavy as nirvana, but i do think that dave grohls drums were better, and heavier when he was in nirvana. pick up this cd if you are a fan."
1,Fire the recording engineer!,"Whoever recorded this Foo Fighters album should get hung...or at least fired. The sound quality of this CD is HORRIBLE. Rarely have I heard as much dynamic compression and hard limiting as this album in my listening life. Just play the last minute of ""Have It All"". It sounds like your loudspeakers are blown with all the awful, overdriven distortion. This is not instrumental distortion by pedal effects, this is recording distortion where the ""engineer"" exceeded the limits of the recording medium...big difference. It's so bad I want to return the album for a refund. I don't have a defective disc either because I've tried other copies of the album on multiple stereos. They all sound equally bad.It's a real damn shame because the music is pretty good. The lack of fidelity makes this album difficult to listen to. Why isn't anybody else complaining?"
2,Very Disappointing,"This one seems to lack the passion displayed on The Colour and the Shape. I've listened to it a few times, and I can't think of a single song from it."
2,Thank God it's my Dad's,"I don't see the hype about this band. To be honest, this band is just subpar. They're not unique and they're nowhere close to being as good as Nirvana. They are way too bloody repetitive in they're songs, and they're songs just aren't... catchy. Or appreciable. I can't believe ""All my Life"" won the grammy for best hard rock song. I gave the album 2 stars because I like the song ""Times like These"" a lot. Otherwise, this is just more boring overrated [you fill in the blank]."
4,"Foo Fighters, not Poo Fighters!","A few really great songs on this album, i was disappointed that it was not available for download on Amazon but I managed to purchase it here the old fashioned way."
4,really good,"This album is really good, not just the singles, but the whole album. I made the lazy mistake of leaving this in my car along with only my kids' CDs, and so I have listened to it maybe 1000 times. It really is good. Lots of interesting minor keys and rhythms, a must for any Foo Fighters fan."
2,The Foos fooled me.,"I thought this album might be full of rockers like the title song, but unfortunately this album goes limp after the first song. Buy the single and don't bother with the rest of the album, if you are wanting a pure rock album. If you want a folksy-rock album, then this is the one for ya."
3,Listfully wishing for more Nirvana,(...) a few of the songs are catchy and i don't mind hearing them on the radio but none of their CD's are the kind that i can throw into my CD player and listen to straight through from the first song to the last song. dave grohl should stick to playing drums (...)
1,Disappointing,"As a big Foo Fighters fan - I was VERY disappointed in this bland offering. Absolutely no ""edge"" at all - it almosts sounds as if they are mocking the consumer by seeing how many times they can repeat the same song on one album and still have people buy it! I don't see the general ""mellowing"" of their sound as a move towards sophistication (as in the case of the latest Chilli Peppers album) at all. No thought has gone into the writing, and some of the songs are approaching the middle of the road / easy listening genre. Altogether not worth the money - I would certainly suggest you borrow it from a friend as opposed to buying it without hearing first."
2,Don't believe these bogus reviews...,"This album is for die hard foofighter fans only!!! If you don't have ""The colour and the shape"" or ""There is nothing left to lose"" please buy those first, as they are both four star albums. Their first album is pretty good too. But this new one stinks...real bad. I have to laugh at these ridiculous reviews."
2,HUGE disappointment... Dave out of ideas,"Looks like Dave has so far run out of ideas for song composition that he has resorted to ripping off his session-mates in Queens of the Stone Age. Dave should know that he's grown too far (too fat, too happy, too rich) from his punk rock roots to try to go back there again. He should stick to the anthemic rock that he was writing in his previous two bands, and not try to go back to stoner punk, which really, is a pale imitation of the real thing. Been a long time since Scream, ain't no going home again.Looking back I can see that 12 or 13 people found this review unhelpful. Sorry about that, but then, I must be a foot or two older than most others that bought this album. Look, I like Dave, and I really wanted to like it, but honestly this is really a weak effort. If you're curious, check out the stuff that inspired this (Black Sabbath, Buzzcocks, Mission of Burma), and prepare to be blown away."
1,I didn't like it,"Although I'm not that big of a foo fan however this new albumis not that good at all in my opinion.The only song's Ilike on here are All my life and Time's like these.I think the rest of the album is real boring musically.When I first heard All my life I loved the high energy rocksound of the song and it is fast and a real great song.The rest of the album made me fall alseep because it's tooslow and boring.I like the Foo fighter's but I mean whathappened here.All my life started off sounding like theold foo fighter's album's which was cool.Then it's likewait a minute is this the sound of the Foo fighter's wereally want to hear? The are only 2 good song's on herein my opinion so I would suggest not to buy this album.The older album's are much better, just buy those.saveyour money."
5,Their 2nd best cd.,although it is there 2nd best cd it is still incredible. it includes my favorite foo fighters song- Times like These
3,"What's the style, Kenneth?","While the style keeps being not so clear, the guys go on with their happy poppy tunes with a smack of rock attitude.The signs are good enough, and you may like only All My Life and Tired, or fall in love with the whole bunch of tracks off the cd. Nothing matters much, and if you're a die-hard fan you'll fall deeper with the Foos, yet if you've never heard of the boys you may be slightly surprised to see that much ado about... almost nothing."
4,JUST BUY IT!,"I have to say that I bought this CD because of All My Life. And sadly enough, it's the best song on the CD. But it does have its high points. For instance, in the song Tired Of You, Dave makes a reference to Triplefastaction's Bearer Of Bad News. Also, none of the songs fall under the ""pop"" category; as their Orange County song The One did. It's a step forward from their last CD, but there's a ways to go. Maybe Dave should focus more on his own band than others. I know he's been playing with the likes of QOTSA and Tenacious D, which is cool, but Foo Fighters should come first. I can't quite give One By One five-stars, but if you're a Foo fan, you need to have this one; so just buy it."
1,not better than nothing,"'One by One' would not have be such a let-down to me had it not followed the brilliant 'There Is Nothing Left To Lose'. It lacks the carefully wrought punch of its predecessor. I was disappointed, but I'll give it a few more rides before sending it to the glue factory."
1,This Album STINKS,"I bought this song based on the two ""In Your Honor"" songs I really like, DOA and Best Of You. Big mistake! There isn't one song on this album I like, and it's boring.Never again will I ever buy a Foo Fighters album."
4,its times like these we give and give again,"foo fighters are great, there a great blend of clean cut rock and grungy punk, Dave Grohl- the lead singer- used to be the drummer for nirvana, giving him pre-existing fame. killer bass, and rifty guitar blend with the intoxicatingly addictive lyrics, delivering whats expected- some kick butt rock with a deeper meaning than most. The awesome song ""Learn To Fly"" has nearly been topped by the new single, ""Times Like These""- a 9/11 response. I was personally blown away by the meoldic rythems created by Grohl and Team. The only reason this album wasnt a five for me, was because of the similar backround music im each song. But dont let my pickiness steer you wrong this is a great album!"
4,Worthy follow-up,"I think Foo Fighters' latest album One By One is a worthy follow-up to the award-winning There Is Nothing Left To Lose. ""Overdrive"" is my favorite song on the album, and ""Halo"" and ""All My Life"" tie at second. And an interesting thing about this album is that there are creative rhythms that blend in well with the vocals, especially on ""Have It All"".There really isn't anything wrong with this album -- okay, maybe the choruses to ""Burn Away"" and ""Tired Of You"" could have been more interesting. But those things don't stand in the way of this great album. One By One proves why Foo Fighters keep bringing home the Grammys."
5,Absolutely Magnificent,"This CD just flat out kicks.There are a lot of other good CDs I've recently purchased (Queens of the Stone Age, Saliva, 3 Doors Down, etc.) but honestly they pale in comparison to One by One.I haven't taken the CD out of the player in my car or home since the day I bought it, and probably won't for several months. You can just keep listening to it over and over and over and ... it's that good.Dave's voice is outstanding, the drums are top notch (of course) and the guitars are amazing. Every song on the CD is a 5 star song. If you haven't bought it yet, what are you reading this for? GO BUY IT."
2,Bland,"Dave's progressively gone downhill since the first record. Rather than try and write memorable ""hooks,"" he should just kick out the reverb, like the first record, and let it go. The ""hooks"" will come. These songs sound too manufactured and produced.Dave's a helluva drummer though (sorry Taylor, I know it's not you playing)."
2,you can do better.,"Every time I go on a road trip, I will buy a new cd to speed the trip. That was the case when I bought this one. I'm not saying that I regret buying it but it is in my stack of sellbacks. One by one is not a bad album, in fact its measures out to being ok. Ok in an ocean full of great music. There are a few songs that I like but overall it is nothing new. The humor that is in the other Foo Fighters albums got left behind in this one. If you're a big fan then pick it up. If you are just looking for a good ""straight out"" rock album, try Audioslave or Moistboyz. Don't be fooled by the name, any one of Moistboyz two albums or first ep puts this to shame."
3,Dissapointed Foos Fan,"Dave's gone for a darker hard rock type album here and it's not bad but he's inherently a pop musician. Most of the songs lack the great hooks he has come up with in the past. But ofcourse, aslong as there are big dumb riffs a plenty the masses will be happy. 'All My Life' and 'Times Like These' are the standouts. Anything after track 4 isn't worth repeated listens. (2.5)"
3,Decent Foo CD...but could've been better!,"I love the foos! Each CD up until this one has been consistantly better than the last. Unfortunately One by One falls a bit short. Don't get me wrong there are some great songs on this one, but there are also some duds. Overall, I think each song could've used some extra polishing and the entire CD lacks quality producing. After a 3 year wait, I would have thought the Foo's would have come back with a masterpiece. This CD seems rushed and could've been much much better."
2,another let down,it seems ever since colour & the shape the foos have stumbled further and further away from their debut sound. there is no doubt the foo fighters first album was the best. they came out with an original grungy sound. it really exciting to listen to. now the foo fighters have fallen in to regular ol main stream music and they sound just like everyone else with very little distinction. foo fighters go back to your original sound and distinguish yourselves again.
4,why is this the worst foo cd??????!?!?,"yes, this effort from foo fighters was a bit laid back, maybe not as great as their last 3 cd's but this is the Cd that started Foo with their more poppy even more hooky songs, this was the precursor to In Your Honor which IMO is AWESOME! but so is this CD, its very listenable at all times. i think its great."
4,Nice Watch (Better than it looks in Pics),I received watch as a gift for 15 year service with the company I work for. Like most guys I have a number of watches with the high end being a TAG.I really like the claissic look of this Festina Watch and can honestly say looks better on my wrist than it does in the pictures. I cannot remember the last time anyone made a comment about my watch when wearing the Tag but in the 6 months or so I have had the Festina I have had a few comments.If you are looking for a reasonably priced watch then I would recommend this model
2,"MADE IN CHINA ,NOT USA MADE",VERMONT AMERICAN IS NOW MADE IN CHINA??I'm debating send these drill bits back for a refund!Very disappointed!This is why we have to demand country of origin information
4,Wistfully beautiful story of adversity overcome,"Tove Jansson's Moomin books are a treasure trove of wistful, slightly introspective fantasy characters for readers 8-14 years old. ""Toffle"" is an ideal introduction, combining some of the same characters (and Jansson's trademark sense of childhood's strange dislocating tenor) with beautiful, wild fullpage illustrations. The story is told in rhyme that (in translation anyway) sometimes slips into mere singsong.Toffle runs away from home but finds his own bravery when a bottle washes up on shore with a plea for help from another child, Miffle. There is a happy ending, of course, but what stays with you is Toffle's alienation from the adult world and his overcoming of those fears."
3,Toffle is Tough for me,"Toffle was tough for me...I love children's literature and picture books but this didn't really capture my interest. The art is funky and the font the poem is clever but the story was slow and unremarkable. If this is a book from your youth that you can share your enthusiasm with a child I would get it...if you are like me, a Toffle novice, I would find something else."
4,Great gun for the price.,"I have a lot of spray equipment and this is not the best gun I have, but it is an amazing value. My only complaint is that they did not include the needle size! As far as I can tell it's 1.4mm. For that they loose one star. They state ""Stainless steel fluid needle and nozzle are compatible with today's advanced coatings."" The reality is, you can only spray thin materials effectively. If you want to paint your car go for it. If you want to load up some latex paint or high solids lacquers, forget about it. I mostly use a 1.8 or larger in gravity feed for my work. Produces an excellent finish if you keep it clean."
3,Disappointing,"We purchased our set at Sam's Club and have exchanged it three times because of a problem with the remote. Even though the TV otherwise works fine, has a good picture, etc. the remote control stops working unpredictably. (The light on the remote goes on and has power but it just doesn't affect the TV, change channels, volume, etc.) We've changed new batteries many times, tried new remotes and talked with Sam's Club and a local Sylvania dealer. No one has an answer or can fix it. When we exchanged the set for another one, and another one, we had the same problem. Too bad since it's basically a good set, but when you buy a remote you expect it to work."
3,Worth a listen for GE fans,"Like most of the late 70s Golden Earring albums, Grab It For A Second is like this: about half the songs are really good and the other half are very average. Barry Hay is still the hopeless romantic, young-boy-just-tryin'-to-get-some-love that he always was.For anyone interested in GE, this is a must have. It is good to see it back in print again in the US. Btw, these late 70s albums are way better than anything the GE has put out in the 80s or 90s."
3,"Good, But Not Great Lancaster Film","The Kentuckian is the only film that Burt Lancaster ever directed, and while it is not a bad film, it is not up to the caliber of Lancaster's many great Westerns.In The Kentuckian, Lancaster plays the titular character, a 17th century frontiersman on his way to take his son to live in wide-open Texas country. He stops along the way to visit his brother, played by John McIntire. But Lancaster gets involved with a former indentured servant, and runs afoul of a mean Walter Matthau (who likes to brandish a whip, no less), and Lancaster and the boy's plans are altered.The Kentuckian is entertaining in several ways, but not as good as Apache, Gunfight at The OK Corral, and his other Westerns. But the acting is very good, and this movie was nothing for Lancaster to be ashamed of, so watch this film when you have a chance. It's not the best, but you won't feel like you've wasted your time."
1,Hysteriously bad,"The Kentuckian is a bad movie but one that is enjoyable because of this. This is the only film Burt Lancaster directed and he knew when to quit. The writing is stiff, and the plot is completely pieced together from every imaginable ""Go West"" movie cliche. Burt also sings a couple of songs and uses genuine frontier Kentuckian colloquialisms throughout the movie. His character also runs the gamut from dumb woodsman to suddenly smart gambler. There is a fantastic fight scene where Walter Matheau is whipping an unarmed Lancaster towards the end of the movie. It's obvious by the way Matheau's flailing around that he didn't know how to use a whip. Thankfully generous amounts of whipcracking sound effects were used to cover this. DVD transfer is poor with bleeding colors. Fuzzy at times though in widescreen. Not to be taken seriously."
3,"Nothing fancy, but they work","These screwdrivers aren't fancy at all, but they do the trick. They aren't magnetic, which is very good. They come in two cheap little plastic cases, kinda like those pocket protectors for pens, and they have extra tips included. If you're a professional watchmaker, you'll probably already have some Bergeon screwdrivers, and these will seem incredibly inferior. But if you just like to tinker these are fine. And they are dirt cheap!"
3,Annoying Lead singer,"These guys have a good sound, it's just the lead singer's voice just annoys me so much that I can hardly stand to listen to this, if these guys had a different lead singer they'd be a lot better"
2,does it really work?,"Seems to create more dust and pet dander flying around than before. I wake up feeling congested and I am not even keeping it on all night. It also creates very, very cold air. May not need the air conditioning this summer. Pleased with the sleek design and that it is portable and not heavy. The fan is very loud on the hightest setting and very quiet on the lowest setting. Overall, not sure if this one or any of them actually work."
3,Useful supplment to APA Publications Manual,"I work with clinical psychology graduate students who are expected to know the APA Publications Manual thoroughly. This handy little book does not replace that publication by any means, but it certainly concisely summarizes some of the basic rules of APA formatting. Students find it much more accessible."
2,Not really necessary,"I've used APA all through college and quite successfully. Now that I'm in my senior year this book was required for a class. The book is completely unnecessary. A simple google search of ""APA format"" will lead you to the Purdue University website that covers everything in this book and for free. There are so many websites available for assistance with APA that I wouldn't recommend bothering with a book."
1,Don't Buy,"When the 6th edition of the APA Manual was first written, there were numerous errors. Therefore, they reissued the manual. This is the manual with errors. Do not buy! The vendor offered to refund my money when I complained but he was going to charge me a restocking fee and I would have to mail back at my expense. DON'T BUY!"
1,Waste of money,"Unfortunately, I bought this book instead of the standard, official APA book, thinking it would be easier and contain all the information I need to understand APA format. And I could supplement whatever else I needed with the Owl at Purdue website.While this book did put the information in an easy format, it's lacking a lot of content, and now I'm ordering the official APA guidebook. I need more information and to see it visually.Had it been more complete, I'd have loved it. Now I consider it a waste of money, since I still have to get the official APA guide."
2,ERRORS in content!!,I found there are errors. How can a guide book have errors?This book is with very poor quality and not worth of buying!!DO NOT use this book to guide your APA style.
4,APA: The Easy Way,Very handy little book! The only suggestion I might have to improve it is to change format of pages to make clearer on which problem goes with which APA demand.
5,APA The easy way,"This simple little book took an hour off my paper writing time. Excellent reference book. It is truly ""the east way"" to understand APA. Not to mention that the price was amazing compared to all the other books I looked at."
2,apa: the easy way,"The APA 6th edetion manual has some pretty significant changes. I suggest buying the manual, as this book did not inform me very well of all the changes."
2,too simplistic,"I thought that this book would provide a quick easy synopsis of apa research paper writing. It's o.k. for undergrad term papers, but lacks essential information on tables, et other more technical report writing. This manual might be o.k. for the beginner, but lacks detail on important questions when preparing a research paper."
1,rip-off.,this book is a rip-off. it is not a book. It is a pamphet of repeatable text. This pamphelt does not cover the APA manual.
3,Not worth the money,"I was very hopeful when I bought this as it seemed it would simplify the often confusing process of figuring out the correct APA style, which seems to change with each edition of the style manual published, however, most of the book was on correct citation, which is also in the style manual. Only a few (eight) small pages give info on style, and this could be found just as easily on one of those single page crib sheets they sell. I have never used it since I have bought it. It was a complete waste of money."
1,Questionable,"Questionable. I have the APA V6 Manual full version and the way I see it if something is not written by that particular company and an update not given by that company, I will question the authority. As a Doctorate student obtaining my PhD, it is extremely important to get everything correct on my dissertation so I will second guess issues. As a professional executive, I question the claim of updating the version that has just come into use."
4,Dusting off the cobwebs,Love this book. Only thing I would like to see is more reference citing examples...otherwise perfect for a quick reference. I'm working on my master's and they are sticklers on the APA style and I really hadn't used it since high school!
3,No Substitute,"When writting in APA style, there's no substitute for the real thing. Buy the APA Publication Manual, read it, use it, and don't bother spending money on guides or shortcuts. They don't work."
4,Very Simple!,"This book is very simple to read and understand. It is not overwhelming, unlike other APA books. I really like it because it's easy to follow."
4,APA the easy way!,"It really is APA the easy way.brief, consise and to the point examples of APA citations.Could use more examples of actual APA papers but for the cost, this book was well worth it."
4,easy way to APA,"I dislike APA more than anyone can even imagine. It takes the fun out of the actual writing and makes it so tedious, but this little guide makes it a bit more pleasant. I believe once you have the basics then this is the best referral guide out there!"
3,Slightly Disappointing Manual,"I was a little disappointed in this manual, not so much with the content, but with the ""prose"" way in which it is organized. One good thing about this book is the large font size, however, which makes it easy to use as a desk reference while you are writing a research paper. But after looking through this book for examples, I still ended up going back to my tried-and-true ""Pocket Guide to APA Style"" by Robert Perrin - the most user-friendly, easy-to-read abbreviated APA guide I have ever seen."
4,apa the easy way,"I was struggling understanding the APA format and causing my grade to plummet but I bought this book, revised my paper and was told I had masterful in-text citations"
2,"Good, but not good enough","If you just want to satisfy your curiosity and get a flavor of what the APA is, then this book is for you, but if your are working on a term paper, for example and need a guide to proper citing of your sources then get something more complete. This book for example totally leaves out things like citing of images, charts and numerical data."
1,Horrible Guide,"This is not a good book.I was required to use this book for my classes, and my students hated the book. I do too.It is full of errors, it is not organized well, and there is useful/important information missing.The idea behind it is great, but the book is not executed well whatsoever."
2,hard to read,"Just a quick note, this is a good book but on the kindle screen it is very difficult to read - the ""sample paper"" has margin notes that are very helpful but difficult to read. I deleted it and ordered the print version, --arrived in two days. This is a helpful tool but a quick word of advice: just order the print version, its actually cheaper."
5,APA Book,The book arrived before scheduled date. It has good basic APA writing information. I would still recommend a more detailed book for most writing.
3,APA the Easy Way,"While I have found this product useful to understand some of the changes in APA, it would be more useful if one has the APA manual to refer to for the stuff this book misses. It is a great beginner edition, but those with a background in APA will be disappointed."
4,Not the Gospel for APA,"I like this book because you don't have to filter through hundreds of pages to find what you need; however I still have had to take my papers to my university's writing center and they have corrected a couple of things. Overall it's a good find, but I recommend having someone double check any work you use this as a reference tool on."
1,Not worth it,"For the price and content, buy the revised 6th edition of the real thing, the APA manual <http://www.amazon.com/Publication-Manual-American-Psychological-Association/dp/1433805618/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1280531820&sr=8-1>. The ""sample paper"" in this ""easy way"" is a joke for anyone wanting to writing an academic paper."
2,APA: the easy way?,"It is the basics, as written in the description. If you have Word 2003 it will show you exactly how to set it up. If you have Word 2007, it would not be necessary, as it is already set up on that software.Seems to be correct and accurate though.Would recommend for those who don't have Word 2007."
4,APA online college class,It is simple and straight to the point BUT my instructors still refer to the APA MANUAL 6th Ed. The APA the easy way is good for quick references but the actual APA manual goes a lot deeper into writing.
4,Used for class,Worked well for the class I took. Well-written and easy to understand. Now I'll have it handy for any other class i take!
4,good for the student new to APA,"I had experience with MLA only, and this book really helped me get started. I recommend the full 6th APA edition for long term use."
5,Easy APA,"It was great and easy to read, perfect for me ! who don't have time to sieve through the traditional APA"
4,APA books,"Needed this for school, was used to writting in the MLA format so APA was foreign to me. This was helpful and made things simpler."
4,Saved my grade on term paper (Fall semester 2007),"I had a term paper due at the last minute that had to be in APA style, which I have never used before. This little book is a good condensation of the larger APA Reference Manual. It had all the information I needed to get my term paper in the correct format without too much hassle; it was pretty much step-by-step which I needed (not being a PC guru either). My only complaint is that it only had one major example, but it did help immensely."
5,apa: easy way,"this is a great book, it has helped me so much in my writing skils. thanks for such a great book."
5,APA Style made very easy,"This manual is so easy to use. Everything is in a catagory and there is no need to wade through hundreds of pages. Easy to use, made writing papers much easier."
2,Not worth it,"I am an animal behavior student stuck in a psychology department. I am forced to use APA for all of my in class writing assignments. I bought this book, because the APA manual is big and poorly organized. I thought it would help cut out all of the crap and help me get to the specifics I needed a bit quicker. It doesn't really cover anything that isn't obvious, and has no statistics references."
2,"Only citing, not writing!","This book only tells you how to cite using APA style, not write. APA style is much more than just referencing. I bought this book hoping for a concise outline of important APA formatting features such as when to use numerals or to write out a number in words, whether bulleted lists are acceptable, etc. Oh well, probably serves me right for trying to avoid the actual APA manual..."
2,Buy the manual if you're new to APA style,"If you are new to writing in APA style, I would recommend buying the APA Manual instead of this guide. The guide is okay for a quick reference if you are familiar with APA style. However, if you haven't used APA style citing in papers, you are probably better off buying the manual."
5,Exactly what I needed,This was exactly what I needed. My Masters program has switched from APA 5th ed to 6th edition recently and I was totally lost. This made my life so much easier.
2,Easy?,I found this book hard to follow and the examples given were of no help. I have found less expensive books that covered the subject much better. ie:I wish I wouldn't have purchased this book....
2,APA: The Easy Way,"I had to do a paper so I bought the book. It was not very helpful. It gave some examples but left out some important details.For instance, it showed an example of the title page but it did not tell how many spaces should go between it. I think that I wasted my money. The APA website and other books were more helpful."
3,If you are serious about APA style...,"The content of this book is accurate, but it is too brief. Spend the money for the official APA style book."
2,disappointing,"The ""real"" APA style guide is complex, and hard to use, and I was hoping for something which would provide enough examples of commonly used formats that would minimize my need for a close review of the manual itself. Unfortunately, ""The Easy Way"" turned out to be too superficial to meet my needs."
3,Just fine.,"I bought this book hoping that it would be a nice little reference alternative to the larger APA manual. I may have opened this book twice this quarter. It does what it says it does, but I often referred to the actual APA Manual for amplifying information, just to be sure I wasn't missing much. Maybe I'll use it more next quarter?"
2,Just the basics,This leaves you short on some important APA information. I ended up buying the manual when I couldn't find some of the basic information needed. If you want a quick reference for the basic citations this is a good manual to have on hand but make sure you have a back up because it isn't always the easy way.
2,Basic but not much else,This is more like a booklet than a book. It's only 60 pages including the index at the back. It won't help with detailed specifics; it's more like an overview of APA style.
1,Don't buy,"It is very hard to find what is needed and impossible to cross reference. Almost not sureful at all. Also, the cable of content is not detailed enough."
1,This book is boring! Save your money.,"Once again another attempt to do a book on the New York Westchester and Boston with ABSOLUTELY no photos of the Bronx portion of this line save for the typical East 180th Street shots that have been seen a million times over. Nothing on Harlem River, Port Morris, Casanova, Hunts Point, Westchester Ave, Kingsbridge Road stations. If you plan on doing a book on such a subject do it the correct way and have photos of EVERY station not just the Westchester stations that have been printed and reprinted in various publications more times then I care to remember. New unseen photos PLEASE not train regurgitated photos."
3,Cute,"This ring is a lot smaller than it looks. It also contains what appears to be a chip on the inside of the band. However, after going to the store itself, and examining other rings, I came to learn it is just the logo of the ringmaking company. I do wish the logo was not there though. The ring is also too thin for engraving. Overall, the ring is cute and simple. Nothing special."
1,Anti-Masonic Book,"Beware! This is an anti-Masonic book and should not be looked upon as a book to provide actual facts concerning Freemasonry. This book is recommended only if one wishes to see what the anti-Masons are saying about Freemasonry.For more balanced and factual aoounts of the nature of Freemasonry, read: 'Is it True what they Say about Freemasonry?' by Arturo de Hoyos & S. Brent Morris, 'Masonic Questions and Answers' by Paul M. Bessel & 'A Pilgrim's Path: Freemasonry and the Religious Right' by John J. Robinson."
3,NEVER BUY THROUGH I-PARCEL,"Sorry, my review is not about the book, but about i.parcel, the company that was supposed to send it to meNever anymore, they probably lost my book and the service was really unpolite with me when i contacted themAVOID"
4,Great Suspense,"This is one of the best suspense novels I've ever read (the other one was ""Rebeccca"" and that became a Hitchcock movie). The story kept the pages turning and I'm looking forward to reading another of Clark's novels. I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes a good mystery."
4,Very Exciting and unpredictable,This book keeps you on the edge of your seat; very suspenseful but she has written much better!!! Keep reading MHC!!
3,This was my first time reading a Mary Higgins Clark book.,"I was a little unsatisfied with the first 4 chapters of this book. MHC did not have a clear desription of the MANY charetors she named. She had to many characters in the book. I did give her 3 stars for making this a great page turner, and a good all in all story. I was feeling so many ways through out this book. I read this book in 1 1'2 days, which is pretty fast for me, but I think I will go back to my very favorite author "" Daneille Steel."
3,Mary Higgins Clark has come a loooooooooong way.,"I am a huge fan of Mary Higgins Clark, and I have read almost all of her novels. This story has a very compelling plotline, but the development of the characters left me unsatisfied. If this is the first Mary Higgins Clark book you read, remember that she wrote this at the beginning of her career and has nearly perfected the art of writing."
3,Flower Reviews...,"Eh, this book was okay. Nancy Harmon/Eldridge is the main character who's first children were murdered and she was found guilty of it. Starting life over she finds the same thing happening...again. This book was kinda boring, I skipped through alot of parts. Despite my age, I could handle the somewhat adult content. I'd give this book a three, because I have read better...and it wasn't even that 'thrilling' as was promised."
3,Slow but extremely entertaining,"I have always enjoyed suspense filled novels by Mary Higgins Clark. I have read a number of her books and they have all been excellent. This novel however, is very slow moving in the beginning. This novel, compared to the her other novels, is also very predictable. Although I was disappointed with this aspect of her novel, I was still able to enjoy reading it. One of her other great novels that I highly recomend is ""Let me call you Sweetheart!"". If you prefer a book that is unpredictable right to the end, do not read ""Where are the Children?"
4,Where are the Children?,"Hey! I actually enjoyed the book! Sure, it wasn't exactly ""intellectually stimulating"" or anything, but it WAS well written. I thought that the suspense throughout the book was great. This was definately not Mary Higgins Clark's best novel, but it DID have a intriging, fairly complicated plot.Although the vocabulary was pretty basic, I'm sure that anyone that reads a book as a pass time and for the fun of it would enjoy the book for what it is: a basic mystery novel. Sure its not a great literary classic, and it never will be, but it's still a great read that would appeal to many."
5,A reader from Arkansas,THIS IS A MUST READ BOOK> Mary Higgens Clark has done a great job writing it. I loved the suspence and could not put it down.
5,"EXCELLENT MYSTERY, I WAS UP UNTIL 3:00 IN THE MORNING!","I (COULD NOT) PUT THIS MYSTERY DOWN! THE SUSPENSE WAS SO THRILLING, AND A FASCINATING CLIMAX. WHAT A WONDERFUL READ, I MISSED A WHOLE DAY OF REALITY, AND WHEN INTO MARY HIGGINS CLARK WORLD!!! IT IS A MUST READ!!! WHAT A GIFT SHE HAS, AND GIVES TO US!! ANOTHER WELL SPEND DOLLAR!"
4,A riviting suspense story filled with unpredictability.,"Where Are The Children, is a riviting suspence story of a mother accused of murdering her children. Now the nightmare is reoccuring and Nancy's children are missing again and she is the prime suspect. This story is the of Nancy trying to prove her innocence and her struggel to convince the Police to let her help find her children before it is too late. This is an incredibly suspenseful and special kind of horror filled book."
2,Disappointing read.,"This was my first MHC book and possibly my last. I found the characters one dimensional, the ""mystery"" transparent, and the plot mediocore. I was interested enough to read the entire book, but was disappointed by the end. I never felt like I got to know anyone. I *may* try one more MHC book, but I really hope it is several times better than this clunker."
4,Where are the Children?,"This is one of Mary Higgins Clark's best books ever. The best part of this book was the suspense she keeps you in. Where she flips from different characters and different parts of the story makes and keeps the book interesting. The story of a mother who is charged of killing her first two children and seven years later has to relive it with her new family and kids. The mystery throughout the book is to know who's doing what and what is going on in different places, which is terrific. The different characters that were brought in made this story great. Clark describes everything so well; you can picture yourself there trying to solve the mystery with the characters."
4,suspenseful,"Where are the Children is a wonderful suspenseful book that I am sure you will enjoy. It keeps you at the edge of seat at all times.Nancy who is a big part of this story has just went through a tragic experience. She has her two little kids out side one day, when she goes back for them they are missing.After years of searching and the media making it look like it was her fault. She finally moves on with her life and has two more children. Yet,not nowing that she was about to go through the same nightmare all over again. To find out what happens read this great book yourself."
5,A Real Page Turner,"This was a great book about a lady named Nancy that was starting her life all over again with a new husband, two new children, a new look, and a new home. Once I got started in this book it was nearly impossible to put down. There was a lot of suspense throughout the whole book. One reasom I liked the book so much was because the author did not keep the kidnapper unknown throughout the whole book. I would recommend this book to everyone. Even if you do not like reading it is a good book and also easy to read."
5,Good to the last page!,One of the best books I've read. Keeps you turning thepages! Makes the reader want to turn to the back tosee how it ends while still in the middle of the book. A favorite for young adults in my high school library. Cannot keep it on the shelves
5,A definate career starter!!,"I am a computer programmer in Nashville TN. I have learned everything I know about programming by reading books at home. I have never used a book for learning that taught as well as this book. It doesn't matter if you are a programming veteran or know absolutely nothing about programming, if you want to learn 'C' this is the place to start. I am currently employed as a 'C' programmer with just the knowledge I got from this book. After this book try the ""Teach yourself Advanced C in 21 days"" title."
4,Kept me Reading,"I'm on an Anne Perry kick lately and Farrier's Lane was just the ticket to keep me up reading. Police Detective Thomas Pitt is on a gruesome murder case and his wife Charlotte, as usual, has to take part in helping to solve the case, often against her husband's wishes. But this old murder and new murder does some how involve her mother's love interest. It is set in London in 1889 with the first murder (gruesome) still unsolved. The murderer was hidden enough to keep me reading one chapter after another. I enjoyed the mystery and all the frills about society and Pitt's household happenings. The novel has some violent and (light) sexual descriptions. Ms. Perry's use of the cockney can be a bit difficult to read. All in all, I found it a good story of Ms. Perry's Pitt novels."
4,Favourite Mysteries,A great read that keeps you guessing. I find all these murder mysteries very enjoyable and cannot be put down easily.
5,LOVE IT!! chain lengthis perfect too,"chain length is pleanty long enough for 2 45's. durable and works very well. ONE NOTE: the clip to hook it is actually one that ""screws"" on so it takes a while to hook and unhook, so i went to the hardware store and changed it out with the J hook. only cost 3 bucks and much easier to get the chain on and off."
4,Music Please,"There's not too much to comment on, so I will keep this short and sweet. I gave it 4 stars because I thought the headphones were very ackward and uncomfortable, otherwise, i think this is a great walkman. 2 Batteries last for 24 hours in this little cool looking machine, and the sound is really good. I recommend purchasing it, but just make sure you alread have headphone."
1,Choose Another,"I am very disappointed in this CD player. Maximum volume on the unit is MUCH too low and the construction of this player is not as sturdy as the description would have you believe. This item is very over-priced and NOT worth it, I would strongly advise another choice."
5,THERE IS ONLY ONE KING PLEASURE! A MUST-HAVE FOR ANY MUSIC LOVER OF VOCAL JAZZ...YOU SHOULD OR WANT TO START HERE WITH THIS CD!,"This collection picks up where his Prestige And HI-Fi Recordings left off. You get not only his Long-Out-Of-Print 1962 album entitled ""Mr. Jazz"" presented in it's entirety! In STEREO!, but 1 (One) Unreleased recording, Plus 8 Tracks released onlyon 78's And 45's making they're appearence on Compact Disc for the first time!, Thus giving you a total of 18 (Eighteen) slices of pure musical delight...Who could ask for more? Upon hearing this Disc, Plus his other recordings you'll quickly hear where several jazz vocalist picked up on his vocal style...And ran with it!"
5,Outstanding,"This was an outstanding book. Filled with a lot of information I had only partially known, and seldom understood. The story of thousands of dams built for no reason other then to keep two Federal agencies in business. Some success and some death causing failures. A must read for anyone west of the Mississippi with a interest in the historical infrastructure of the western states despite the massive mishandling of Federal funds to aid in ecological disaster. A true study in government math at alludes us all."
5,Must read,"Loads of information and keep your dictionary at your side. Historic yet witty and engaging,"
4,terrific - and terrifically scary - history,"I picked up Marc Reisner's books after moving to CA recently from what I now realize is blissfully non-seismic and adequately-watered New England... This is a great history of man getting the (temporary) best of nature and whistling past the dam. The chapter on Bureau of Reclamation chief Floyd Dominy is worth the price alone: he is the type of headstrong, puritanical warrior (no exaggeration there) that American has produced in droves, yet he is virtually unknown now. The character profiles of John Wesley Powell and others are equally as good. I only wish that other historians had the sense of humor and irony that Reisner employs so well."
5,stunning,"While ostensibly about the history and future unsustainability of the West's water policies, the political intrigue could likely apply to any number of other resources. A devastating condemnation of politics and bureaucracy, and a revealing expose of business-as-usual in America. Systematic and devastatingly argued. I felt angry, bitter, cynical, and powerless after reading this book - one of the most eye-opening I have ever read. Even if you do not agree with Reisner's premise, this is a must-read book. Shocking and ultimately heart-breaking."
5,A Great Book with Historical Information about the Damming or the West and Two Disfunctional Government Departments,"I reorder this book after not being able to find my first copy. The author has put so much information in CD that it is overwhelming. The battle between the Corp of Engineers and BLM is classic intergovermental department infighting. The amount of taxpayer dollars wasted is astromical and gives the reader some insite about the current state of our government's finances. There is a lot of weather information that will challenge the ""global warming crowd's"" short term, myopic view. All of the dams and water diversion projects were a classic transfer of weath. The one suprise was how the damming of the Columbia River was the reason the United States won the war. You need to buy and read the book to find out why."
3,America's Growing Deserts,"This book was an alarming, eye-opening account of how the United States is running out of it's own water resources that provide for many of desert urban areas. Why is it that we are settling in areas that are not natural for us as human beings to live in, and depleting our water resources and damaging natural beauty in order to live in seemingly uninhabital areas, such as Las Vegas, and Phoenix? This book looks to address this and much much more. A great read for anyone interested in enviromental politics and issues in the U.S.."
2,Not totally accurate,"While the book is an interesting book and reads quickly, by no means is this a completely accurate book. In the section on the Owens Valley where I live, the author alludes to a lack of any more ranches here since L.A. took the water. There are over 100 cattle brands still registered in the valley. There is also an issue with drilling in the Bishop Cone (Bishop Creek delta) which is not accurate. No one remembers Reisner even coming to the valley to research the book. While the book is very readable and excellent overall, do not use this book as a reference in college papers. You could use it as a jumping off point to do further research with better information. A better book is ""Water and Power"" by William Karll although a little denser. The documentary ""Cadillac Desert"" is outstanding, however."
3,Think it over!,"I'm 16 and I picked this book to read for my AP environmental class summer assignment. While I have to admit this book is very educational and has some really good information, I have to say that it is pretty hard to read if you're new to the whole topic. If you aren't too fond of reading about politics, also know that it's VERY political. I wanted to write this because I was pretty excited about it, seeing as how all or most of the reviews are so positive. I was just so dissapointed in the book and how difficult it was to find it fun. If you are interested in the subject and don't mind the politics, then you should definitely read it. If not... just be aware."
4,a decent product,"this recorder is pretty decent, especially for the price. I'm a college student who uses this product for recording lectures and it performs fairly well. However, you may want to be close-by the voice(s) you want to record or purchase a mic plug-in. The built-in surround mic picks up some unwanted background noise when I record on a meduim volume setting and the lecturer's voice is drownded (recording on a higher volume makes the situation worse and a lower volume makes the voices almost inaudible)."
3,"Pretty good, then failed COMPLETELY!","I have this model, about two years old. Its drawbacks are its tape speed and pause/VAS switches that are too close together and which are almost indecipherably labeled. But it had the other features I wanted -- external mic jack and an AC adapter port.I used it regularly until yesterday when the entire microphone system failed. It appears to work perfectly, but it picks up no sound now whatsovever -- not with the built-in mic nor with the external mic jack. A real problem when you need a reliable recorder!"
4,Crepe Cookery,"A replacement for a 30 year old lost book I found when I was in college. Easy to use, delicious recipes. The author has several other good cookbooks."
1,Poor design,"I ordered a steel mailbox because of its strength, but when it arrived I discovered that all of the attachments, such as the flag and the door catch were plastic. There is no way that these will hold up under the heat of the sun and the wind. Also, the door catch immediately fell off after sticking it on. If this is an attempt to save manufacturing money, it was a poor call. I immediately returned it."
5,Excellent for the price,"Completely as described. Yes, the handle and flag are plastic, but will withstand the elements forever as they won't corrode over time. Yes, you have to install the flag but that is all part of the bargain i guess."
4,Happy Mail Boxing,"My mail carrier loves it, saves them from walking up to my door. This size is hard to find. Lowes and H-Dep do not carry it any more. I live in a neighborhood that is classified as RURAL so the size is great for receiving and sending most packages. I Ebay a lot. Durable and roomy."
2,thin metal mail box,This product was packaged and received from shipper without any damage. The product itself is very thin sheet metal that is not well fastened at the seams. while attaching to the base the outer covering seperated from the bottom. There appears to be only 6 points of attachment between the two surfaces. These are not welds but a resistive punch that pulls apart easily. I would not have purchased this product had I seen it first.
3,Great for home businesses,"I love the size and durability of this mailbox! I run a business from my home, and I ship and receive many packages a day, so this size is perfect for accommodating me. However, I've noticed that on a rainy day, the inside gets flooded..."
3,Not too good!,"This mailbox IS NOT THE one pictured on the site. I noticed it as soon as I opened the box. The item number that is checked on the end of the box is the one I ordered. But the one I ordered is the one pictured in this review (ST200000) and as you can see it has what appears to be a plastic handle on the lid and a plastic latch on the top of the box for the handle to catch in to keep the box shut. That is the main reason I ordered this particular box because the one I have is broken and the mailbox lid does not stay shut; therefore my mail gets wet! The box I received, does not have a latch on the top at all, and as a matter of fact, it won't even stay shut! Wanted to return it, but when you call, you can't speak to a person at amazon to tell them the problem. I felt if I returned it they would send the same mailbox back to me."
3,latch,"Size of this mail box was great, but the latch that held the door closed did not work, I had to put a different latch on it"
1,Inferior Quality,"My order is dated February 9, 2010, and my mailbox is no more than scrap metal. In short order, the door would not stay closed. Then it bent in half. I am going to be forced to replace a mailbox that should have lasted many more years. I have never replaced a mailbox because it fell apart - until now. How long should one last? I think twenty years is a reasonable expectation. I do not know where I will find my next mailbox, but it most certainly will not be a Solar Group box."
3,"Solar ST200000 Group Jumbo Size Steel Rural Mailbox, Silver Sold by Warehouse Deals, Inc","When I got the product it was packed well, but the original box was damaged like in description as expected although the mailbox was also damaged slightly. The description claims product in excellent condition but had to straiten it out in order to use it ,not a big deal for me but other may find product not able to use."
3,Usable for me,"Mine arrived in 2012 with gray paint, metal handle, and plastic flag. No latch - just a friction fit with the door lip.The end of the manufacturer's box was crumpled, though to me it looks like the damage was done before UPS took custody. I uploaded photos of the deformations.The sheet metal is VERY thin; I am able to easily bend it with my fingers. For the bent handle, I slipped a plastic spatula into the gap and pulled on it to widen the handle enough to fit a finger inside.The clinch fastening for the side-to-bottom will probably hold, especially if you fasten it to a board with screws through the sides. I mounted it onto a metal plate, so I drilled out the clinches at the bottom and put in brass bolts.I haven't asked my letter carrier about it yet, but I think he likes not having to cram our Amazon and eBay packages in our old, smaller mailbox."
2,Disappponting,"This item is described as ""Silver galvanized steel"". There is no indication on the box or elsewhere that it is galvanized. In fact, it is a grey painted steel and will likely rust out as quickly as its painted predecessor did. We'll see.Amazon also sells painted mailboxes of the same size for less. One might as well order the cheaper unit if that is Amazon ships anyway.."
4,A little different design,"It arrived rather timely, about 6 days from order to receipt.The jumbo is as big as I have found and is big enough for most mail and packages.The latch is a pull with clip on the inside. It did not catch at first but a small adjustment with my fingers made it catch and stay closed. The only plastic piece on the unit is the flag swivel, the flag, latch and box are all metal. I would purchase this again, as its construction and size are worth the extra few dollars when comparing it to the large model."
3,"BIG, inexpensive mailbox","I was hoping for a plain, sturdy galvanized steel jumbo mailbox that I've been unable to find anywhere any more, rather than a light-gauge, made-in-China imitation. It holds my mail."
3,Adds safety to driving while on the phone but have to be patient with the voice recognition system...,"I think it was an ok purchase since I am in Real Estate and I have to use my phone a lot while driving. However, it is sometimes challenging to get the system to recognize a specific name or command. I have to try different ways to pronouce a name until I realize which one the device understands. I would not recommend against buying it but just know that it will take some getting use to and patience to get it to work the way you want it. Jorge."
4,Good Product But Upgrade Unavailable Without Repurchase,"I love this product but am very unhappy about the fact that you cannot upgrade to version 1.6 without paying the full price for the product again. If you purchased 1.5 on Handango, they will let you upgrade for only $9.99, but you can't do this if you purchased 1.5 on Amazon or anywhere else."
5,Microsoft Voice Command 1.5,"This is a great product. I continue to be surprised by the nearly flawless performance of this voice-driven phone utility. I usually keep my phone in a holster that covers its screen. With Voice Command, I can make calls, control ring tones, check appointments, and even ask for the date and time without having to open the holster. This is a must-have product if you use your cell phone in your car."
3,Microsoft Voice Command,Nice product. Works most of the time. I wish I could use my BT Headset to activate Voice Command.
3,Voice Command,"This is a great program when it installs and works properly. At first notice this is a Pocket PC 2003 program though they said it would work with Windows Mobile 5.0. I installed and had problems which MS quickly helped me through. Though when trying to install it in a phone ""Pocet PC 2003"" smart phone the program wouldnt function at all. Go figure- Like most MS products, my turning off then back on didnt help."
4,Very useful software,You can do many things without using the pen or the keyboard. I would like more commands were added to this software. Something bad is you can not use the hadsfree button of your PDA phone as the Voice Command Button.
1,Not smartphone compatible,"Buyer beware. While this program is prominently advertised on the CD that comes with the TMobile SDA smartphone, it is not compatible and only works with phones running Windows Mobile 2003 or phones such as the MDA. Although there appear to be Smartphone compatible beta versions running around, Microsoft denied their existence to me."
1,Not sure if it is the Treo or the Microsoft prgm doesn't work when needed,Software is unpredictable and worthless with the Treo 700wx at least. Save your receipt you'll probably need to return the software if you can.
1,Useless! Microsoft trying to make another buck!,This should be built into hardware not another piece of software to run on resource limited Pocket PC. Put it on a chip! Other cell phones have it why can't a pocket pc phone have the same. The audio quality is the same as what my first 386 based computer could generate in the early 1990's
4,Great Product! Indispensable if you use a PocketPC Phone,"This product really is amazing, because it really does WORK! Sure, there are occasional bugs and glitches, but all in all it does a truly remarkable job of recognizing spoken commands and answering requests. If you have a PocketPC Phone, this product is a must have. Look out to see if you can get the newest version (1.6), though, as 1.5 doesn't support commands via bluetooth headsets."
5,Awesome Product...Every HTC 8125 owner should have this!,This is a totally amazing piece of software. It works incredibly well with no voice training whatsoever. Everyone that has a PocketPC Windows Mobile 5.0 SmartPhone should have this software. I have a Cingalar 8125 and use it all the time. Voice dialing is very easy. Much better than the crap that comes bundled with the phone and OS. It even announces my appointments and reminders. A MUST HAVE.
5,The Memories Didn't Let Me Down,"It should really suffice to say that, in my quest to replace the vast majority of the vinyls I had amassed over the years, this was a very special contribution to my cd equivalent which was never going to be disregarded. I love it with the same passion I had for it way back when, and it now has a privileged place in my updated collection."
3,"Superb Acting, Flawed Script","Blue Sky has its basis in fact: the 1963 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty limited testing to those underground. Within this historical moment, Tommy Lee Jones plays Hank Marshall, an Army nuclear engineer, is wife Carly played flawlessly by Jessica Lange. The plot is predictable, its underlying emotion typical Hollywood melodrama. But you almost forget this as Jones and Lange breathe life into this movie."
3,Unconditional love,"Jessica Lange's character is a glamourous mentally fragile woman living a fantasy of what she had hoped her life would be. Tommy Lee Jones'character plays her faithful husband and is so obviously passionately in love with her with no conditions. With divorce on the uprise, it is a story of ""for better or worse, richer or poorer"". He shows her unconditional love that I am sure would be inconceivable for most men or women. The children, although greatly affected by her antics also remain faithful to her and the family. I gave it a 3-star rating only because time is so precious that we do have to pick and choose what we spend time doing or watching, but the moral of the story I would give a 5-star rating."
2,floozy & boozy jessica gets her golden boy,"jessica lange won an oscar for this, proof positive that some years are so bereft of strong performances, they HAVE to give it to somebody. apart from that, this is a silly exercise in anti-government paranoia, with a wasted tommy lee jones and not much else."
1,***What a terrible & poorly designed high-priced product.,"Consumer notice: There is absolutely nothing ELITE about this poorly constructed oven. The knobs barely work, no markings for temperatures (barely visible) and the timer is poorly designed. The door mechanism brokedown after just a few months. Now the whole thing is in the trash. What a waste of almost $100."
4,Great,"I've really enjoyed my oven. No, I can't put a 5 lb chicken on the spit but a small one is perfect for just the two of us. I've used mine almosst daily for about 2 years and it is still is very good shape, works just fine. I'm ordering one for my Mom and my friend just ordered hers too."
3,A little disappointed.,"Elite Cuisine arrived and yes, they were right it is compact. I was disappointed when I bought a chicken (5 lb) and wanted to use the rotisserie. The bird was too big! The rack and tray that have to stay on the bottom would not let the bird turn completely. I even tried to retruss the chicken tighter. No go. Guess only cornish hens will be rotisseried. I used the convection/roast setting and the chicken turned out great. It works very well otherwise."
2,"Sound advice, but not very practical","Very little practical advice here in this slim 69-page effort. The advice is sound and good, but vague. Advice like ""Be confident"" and ""Respect the woman"" is fine, but you have to be about 17 years old to not know this stuff. It is so padded with overwrought military and sports analogies that parts of it aren't so much about building relationships with women, but more about an old self-aggrandizing military man telling stories. The tell: each chapter opens with hackneyed sayings from Sun Tzu's Art of War. And the layout is really annoying: it's as wide as a magazine, but without column breaks."
1,A throwback,"This book is a great guide for someone who would be trained by the Marines. If you are inclined to believe that women are are on this earth to gratifiy the sexual desires of men, this book is for you.This clown and Ann Coulter should get together, their mentality were made for each other."
1,Stupid book. Do not be fooled by the title of his book,"War and Dating are two different things. This guy is trying to equate them by his military experience and quotes from Sun Tzu. War is to kill enemies. Dating is to enjoy life. This guy has wrong thinking. Even though if you win a girl's heart by learning his ""strategies"", you wouldn't be happy as a normal person. You just feel like winning a ""war"". Give me a break."
5,Women will love this too!,If this book isn't a best seller among its counterparts -- I will be greatly surprised. Men can learn about keeping a woman's respect in tact -- which I found to be the best part of the book. It has light hearted humor mixed with some great tips -- a good book for both sexes! Tell all your friends!
2,Better than nothing,"Like most auto repair manuals not published by the manufacturer, this manual leaves out a lot of information necessary to quickly repair problems. For instance, the electrical diagrams have wiring color codes, connector pin-outs, etc., but there are no diagrams to help locate any of the components. The manual devotes about half of its pages to topics the average user will already know, such as standard maintenance instructions, but fails to provide anything vehicle specific. The detailed engine rebuild procedures are useful if you need them, but given the longevity of modern automotive engines this data could probably have been better published elsewhere and replaced in this manual with more information on common failures. If you are looking for information that will help you repair the most frequently occuring problems, this is better than nothing but much less helpful than it could have been."
4,early original superhero science-fiction,"I'm not too big a fan of Superman, but this book has nearly won me over. Almost every story within is brimming with all the right ingredients for the very best 50s-60s pulp science-fiction. Whereas the Greatest Batman Stories volume was dragged down due to poor writing, the Greatest Superman Stories are bursting with life and new ideas. Most of the stories are ""alternate"" to the then-standard continuity, so they are all embodied with creative freedom to end how they want. These are powerful instances of writers doing whatever they want to the only perfect superhero (preceding the vein Alan Moore showcased inSuperman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?).And it's all done with the lightest and campiest feel possible. This is Superman.writing: [7/10]art: [7/10]"
3,Good,"""Born to Be Blue"" and ""Cool Blues"" are the standouts. Overall a very good, if somewhat subdued, recording."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Ike Quebec is the problem with Grant Green's ""Born To Be Blue."" He's way too laid back. A sax player with more energy might have elevated this beyond the doldrums, but as it is, they're just phoning it in.Grant Green deserves 2 Stars for showing up, but with so many great sets in his discography, you're safe bypassing this."
3,Born to be Ballads,"This one was a little too subdued for my tastes. I didn't like Idle Moments or Street of Dreams either. And I'm really not into Ballads. So I guess if you like the slow stuff, you might like this one too. Otherwise, you might be a bit disappointed."
5,"Cool, Yes!","Cool, Yes! But also add energetic, versatile, smooth and mature. Nick starts this project with lots of energy on 'Can You Feel it' and demonstrates some more ""Uptempo"" on 'If You Ask Me'. He Sneaks a little versatility with his own vocal effort on 'Rainy Night in Georgia' (Brook Benton would be proud). His smoothness comes through on 'From Me to You', 'A Moment With You' and the title cut 'Keeping it Cool'. But the maturity is shown on his new version of 'High Flyin' from his (Just Come On in) 2004 project. Same song, but his growth as a guitarist is highly notice by the JazzeOne. I see shades of the mature sounds of Norman Brown and George Benson, yet you still hear the melodic sound that Nick has developed over the last few years (check out 'Always Thinkin of You'). I like Nick's groove, maturity and this entire CD; it is 'Cool, Yes!' ~the JazzeOne"
1,A Stunning Achievement For This Awesome Artist,"A ""5 STAR"" CD! All I can say is Hurry, Don't Wait to Get Nick Colionne's latest CD, each and every track on this CD is fabulous. If you are not already a NC fan, check him out. And, be sure to catch one of his live performances, they are not to be believed. You will be a fan for life."
5,Nothing Better,The ONLY negative I can see with this book is that it doesn't come in pocket size for you to use at games. Buy it and you'll agree!
1,Not what I wanted,"it has no numbers and really no distinctions at all between the different verses, all of the sayings are randomly put together, and it is difficult to know when one has ended and another begun"
4,I was held captive up until the last sentence.,"The Last Valentine has a truly wonderful mixture of pleasure and disquietude, that keep the reader captive up until the last sentence of the novel. The love story between Neil and Caroline,is so strong that you will need a box of tissues just to get you through the first chapter."
5,The Last Valentine,"It was an emotional book to read with tears coming from my eyes as I read it. I got so involved in the book that I lost track of all time. I did not want to put it down. I have read The Paradise, Ticket Home, and I will be ordering your latest book, The Christ Report. I can't wait for your next book to come out."
5,What a great book,I have never read a book that made me feel so good about life. This book was a great treat for anyone. I loved it so much I sent my copy to my best friend in California and now I need to get a new one. What an attention getting (and keeping) tear-jerker. I loved it
5,For anyone that's ever loved with all their heart!,"The Last Valentine was a wonderful love story. For anyone that's ever experienced true love like Neil and Caroline, you will fall in love all over again. You understand the hopes, dreams and longing. Wonderful afternoon read!"
5,This was the best love story that I have ever read.,In the Last Valentine you can relate to Caroline Thomas as she is going on with life while not knowing if her husband Neil is alive or not. He is in the Air Force and he has to go to war during World War II. This book was very interesting if you want to know what an Air Force pilot went through during the war. He was shot down during an air raid and was taken in by the Phillipino guerillas. The nursed him back to health the best they could. He fought with them against the Japs. He died fighting with them. His body was returned home fifty years after he left for the war. His wife Caroline then knew he was home safe and she could pass on and be with him forever in eternity.
4,"A little predictable and slow, but a good afternoon read","I guess I missed the point, but I was more interested in the son and interviewer's romance than the parents. It just seemed a little unbelievable and almost hard to imagine. I read it and didn't walk away dissatisfied though. Maybe a follow up about how the son lived out his parents love with the new woman in his life??"
5,the coolest love story ever,I usually dont like love stories but this is not your usual love story. It has everything you want in a book .its one you cant put down. anyone that has ever been crazy in love will love this book.
3,decent love story,This book is a very easy read. It's a sad and innocent love story but nothing that made my eyes tear.
5,GREAT!,"I love this book, Real love does exist, Love is kind love is patient! oh yeah read this book if you are a romance fiend like me."
4,A timeless love story,"A well written page turner that tugs at your heart. I read this book in two days, and I don't like love stories! This book touches deep inside the reader to a place that exists in all of us. As our heroine, Caroline, awaits the return of her soldier husband, the reader waits too, feeling her pain and wishing with each page for him to come home. This story tells about the kind of love that transcends time and lives on in the face of incredible adversity. It reminds us that hope really does have a place in a lover's heart."
2,"I appreciate a good love story, but this one misses the mark","I consider the books I buy as gifts to myself, and I relish the time I spend in reading one. The Last Valentine was a major disappointment, and a waste of my time and my money. Aside from being totally predictable, the author seems to underestimate the intelligence of his readers, and feels the need to explain details that are obvious to most of us. That, plus the incessant use of cliche after cliche, made this read boring for me. You could easily tell what was going to happen on the next page, and the next, and the next. If I can't learn something from a book, I at least want to be entertained. This did neither for me. I hope the author doesn't quit his day job."
1,Weak characters and so-so writing,"The character development is not deep enough. We are given just a glimpse into what Neil and Caroline's time together was like. It is hard to sympathize much with either of them because we do not really know much about them as a couple.A great story idea that was not taken to a deep enough level. Read it for a quick love story, but it is definitely not Bridges of Madison County."
2,Predictable and poorly written,"I ordered this book expecting to be surprised and moved emotionally. I was neither. As an English teacher, I found the writing to be below the quality I would have expected. However, perhaps the part that really annoyed me was the religious overtones. I would not have objected, had I known that in advance. I would not, and do not buy books by certain publishers or those whose beliefs I do not share. The ending was very predictable. I knew what was going to happen very early on in the book and that is exactly what happened. I found it trite and sappy. I could have rated it even lower, but there was a good story there, just poorly told."
5,Good read,I first read this many years ago when it first came out and enjoyed it so when I stumbled across it on line at a great price I ordered it to add to my library. Have not had a chance to read it yet but will soon and will update this review then. The book is in good shape and arrived promptly.
1,Not worth it.,"I thought it would be the perfect for the gym. Little did I know that it wasn't all it was cracked up to be. The arm piece broke the second day, the reception on the radio was not very good and the head set did not fit properly. It's a great looking radio and very light in weight, but what good is it if it doesn't work. I often found times when a little tap would turn it on or off. Don't waste your money on this. PLEASE!"
1,Lousy Unit,"My experience with this product has been lousy. Lousy reception in the gym, lousy headphones that broke too easily, lousy armband that, at its largest setting, was still too tight on my arm--leaving its impression for hours afterward. Stay away from this one."
4,Does the job admirably,"This player works great for everything I use it for: stationary bike, treadmill, and weights. It's smaller than its Sony equivalent and packs a wallop with its Bass boost. The player does gets 4 stars, mostly for the included headphones (extremely uncomfortable on the ears -- I threw mine away and used an older set lying arond the house) and the slightly awkward velcro/elastic strap (just leave the velcro alone and the player should fit your arm just fine). Aside from that, it's a winner."
5,excellent radio,"I feel tired turning the tuning wheel every time commercials come on, so I went out and bought this digital tuning radio with memory presets. Now I can jump between AM talk radios quickly. This makes exercise feel more enjoyable (time goes faster too).RF-SW200 has great built quality, the metal case/preset button feels very solid, mine is made in Taiwan, that assures me it received better quality control than those made by other third world countries.It's also a great office radio, I use a Sennheiser head phones and the FM stereo sounds amazingly clean (I only recommend XBS --panasonic's extra bass, with a lesser head phones).One note on the tuning increments, it can be set as small as FM 0.05Mhz and AM 9kHz, it's clearly printed in the instructions :-)Also there's a $20 rebate going on till end of Dec. 2003."
1,Pathetic,If you are considering buying this product....don't! The reception is terrible. This portable radio has failed at clear reception in the gym and jogging outdoors when others around me are having no issues. I have chalked up the money spent on this unit as waisted.
3,"Great radio, but uncomfortable headphones","This radio is great. Working out is a lot more fun while listening to music, and this radio doesn't get in the way because it just attaches to my arm. Also, it looks cool, I get good reception, it stays snug on my arm, it's light-weight, and it has a lock switch that prevents me from accidently draining the battery. The only problem is that the headphones are extremely uncomfortable. The plastic pieces that go in your ears are too big for me. I had to go out and buy some Sony headphones that were more comfortable."
3,"Good News, Bad News...","Rated as a radio, the FM performance of this unit is quite good. But AM sensitivity is poor on all but the strongest stations. My old Sony Walkman easily bested it on AM. The radio has many presets for stations and is very lightweight. It all depends on whats important to you."
4,"Great Radio, Horrible Headphones","Bought this radio to use while jogging, the radio itself is very lightweight and tough. I love the fact that it plays 25 hours on one AAA battery. I am disappointed at the headphones, which are very uncomfortable - I wonder in whose ears they fit. The radio is not the cheapest, but i'm convinced that Panasonic makes the greatest products. One thing i did notice was that the radio lacks the ""mono/stereo"" button, which is present on other radios. I wish it was on this radio because there is one radio station in town that would come in much clearer with that setting. The radio comes in three color combinations, Blue/Black, Silver/Black and Red/Black."
4,"The Later review of ""The man who Awoke""","I recall the powerful images that the writer produced, and was amazed at some of the ""images"" that are just now coming into focus: without giving too much of the plot, the time in which he awakes, to find mankind enslaved by machines that cater to thier dreams is so far ahead of his time it is unreal. When one thinks of the power of the internet today, and that the writer could not have ""known"" in advance (in 1933 a computer was still a box of gears) that the computer would advance as far as it did, let alone, that it would be ""connected"" it makes one stop and think how far ranging some of our writers in the past really were."
1,Not actually a real book,"This is the second tie this has happened to me buying through Amazon - this ""edition"" is not actually a published book, it's simply a copy of the story, put inside a cover. There is no publisher, and often the formatting is wrong. I returned it right away, but since I had to pay $4 shipping, the whole thing was a mistake. I'll be more vigilant in the future, but Amazon should really make clear that some of the things they advertise as ""books"" are actually just photocopies."
4,A great story in need of editing.,"First off, ""The Octopus: A Story of California (Twentieth Century Classics)"" edition has several spelling errors and typos. certainly a book of this quality deserves a better editor than it received. Also, Frank Norris has a tendency to repeat himself. Not just occasionally but routinely. Even using the exact same phrasing within a few pages of the last time it was used. It certainly could have been slimmed down, probably by about a hundred pages or so.The story is a phenomenal one though and deserves to be read in spite of the sloppy editing."
1,Not for me!,"Book came highly recommended by an older cousin....but even though I did learn some of our valley history that I didn't know, I feel the authors real goal was to prove that he is smarter than me....& I guess he succeeded."
3,An Expose,"Frank Norris was among other things a new correspondent, an editorial assistant, as well as a war correspondent in Cuba. He is considered by many to be the first important American naturalist writer. Naturalists strive to observe and report dispassionately, much like a scientist. His writing reflects this belief, it is the modern day equivalent of a ""20/20"" expose. He details how monopoly affects the average man. He tells the story of the lifes that were changed as a result of our headlong rush towards industrialism. The book is long, melodramatic, and filled with scenes of early California. Unfortunately, the book carries less weight than it did when it was written and tends to become a bore after 300 pages, or less. Also we must not forget that the events in this book actually happened. So unless you have to read it for class..."
2,The Octopus is a deep look at the corruption of the railroad,"It was long winded, small texted, tale of woe. The book was 450 pages about wheat, how good could it get?"
3,it's ok,"Maybe it's obvious, but I just want to point out that you cannot fit double sized dvd cases (like box sets). Also, it's kind of unstable on my carpet floor. Other than that it's pretty good, looks nice."
4,Exactly what I needed.,"The DVD/Blu Ray disc tower is good and sturdy. Easy to assemle, going together in a few minutes. I am considering ordering a second tower to compliment the first..."
1,absolutely horrible,"This product is terrible because the holes in the middle of the DVD tower are too big for a blu ray and therefore make it difficult to properly insert your blu ray/dvd. On top of that they do not pay for you to return this item (costs $17) and they also charge you $10 restocking fee which comes out to a nice total of $27 - when i paid $40 for it. Terrible company, terrible product, stay clear and buy through amazon"
3,"For growing greens, not jar sprouting","I am new to sprouting, very new in fact. I read that buckwheat was a very easy sprout so I bought this organic seed. Unfortunately, it turns out that this is not the right buckwheat for ""normal"" jar sprouting, this seed is for growing greens/grass and requires that type of sprouter. This seed has the inedible hull still on it. I think the description could be a little clearer. If you want to sprout buckwheat look for hulled buckwheat or ""groats"". But not toasted buckwheat or 'kasha', obviously that will never sprout, having been cooked. The only upside is my birds seem to like it a lot so I guess it won't go completely to waste."
4,Good mix of fact and fiction,"As a matter of principle, I reserve 5 star ratings for works destined to be studied by school children a hundred years from now, but this one kept me up a little to late a little too often. It's the characters, not so much the technical stuff that that kept me reading (although the facts seem to be well researched). It's not often I plow all the way through a novel (I tend to get bored easily), but I went cover to cover rather quickly with this one. The ending delivers a really interesting twist, but you're going to have to read it for yourself to find out what it is!"
5,High Intrigue-chilling plot,"The author has dealt with a different and controversial topic in this action-packed, page-turning thriller. The story grabs the reader from the beginning and takes you through a nightmare of the worst kind..right up to the surprising twist on the last page. Bradford Morgan has an extraordinary talent and I highly recommend this novel."
2,"High Tech, Maybe. Old News, Yes.","The technologies described in this book have been around for years. Most, if not all, fortune 500 companies have implemented the principles describe in this book. (Telecommuting, data warehouses, the Internet, client/server,...). I would like to know what the future has to offer."
5,An outstanding exploration of the jury system.,"A book that I will certainly re-read in the future, A Trial By Jury was a gripping read. Detailing the author's experience as a juror in a second-degree murder case, it touches on most of the aspects of being a jury in today's society, both positive and negative. Some reviewers have blasted the author for his purported pretension, but I did not take his writing that way. He is an academic, yes, but understands the weaknesses in both himself and this country's jury system.Fans of true crime, sociology or even any non-fiction would enjoy this book."
1,Disappointing,"In a word, disappointing. Overall, A Trial by Jury was a trial to read. It was slow moving and over written. The author spent too much time patting himself on the back. If he spent more time getting to know his fellow jurors instead of judging them, the book would have had some added dimension. This reader walked away thinking that Mr. Burnett thinks quite a bit about him and not much about those he feels are beneath him. Not worth the read."
2,Aargh!! Keep academics off your jury,"This book is painfully overwritten and the greatest blessing is its short length.As a trial attorney I give it two stars because it does cover an interesting topic and a murder that is typical in its quirkiness.But the story could have been told much more compellingly if the author had taken time after the trial (or during deliberations for that matter) to find out his fellow jurors true thoughts on the matter. As it turns out the book portrays the verdict as somewhat a trial by a judge .. with Judge D. Graham Burnette presiding.For those who are fans of the courtroom drama or true crime novels, this is not your flavor. More autobigraphical and introspective than insightful into discovering the truth of the crime or what the other jurors really thought."
2,Pretentious Blind Man and an Elephant,"I purchased this book on the basis of reviews that said it gave new insight into the workings of U.S. juries (which have certainly been mystifying of late in highly publicized trials). The author is so self-involved and pretentious, however, that all the musings are through a glass darkly. He considers himself a jury of one with regard to his fellow jurors, the officers of the court, and the entire judicial system, and he strives with the single-mindedness of a bad graduate student to fit his experience into his academic intellectual constructs. The judge, and some of the other jurors, in the case must have found him laughable. The weird ""true crime"" underpinnings of the ""intellectual"" gloss remind me of Victorian painters who disguised their lasciviousness in Greek and Roman props. A big disappointment."
3,Trapped in the jury room,"This book accurately portrays the intensity and emotions which develop during jury deliberations. The author is quite critical of his fellow jurors (they all seem to be a bit strange and not overly bright) but admits his own confusion and frustration. The judge was certainly not very helpful and seemed actually hostile to the jury. I think that I would have voted to acquit also (not giving anything away since the author tells you the verdict in the beginning) based on the evidence presented. The crime itself was lurid, the witnesses a parade of weird characters, and the defendant not the type you'd want in your neighborhood, yet the jury tried to be fair and objective. I'd rate this as realistic in its depiction of a typical jury, a fast read."
4,Good Insight-Well Written,"Okay, so here is a book about a very real practical subject written by an academic. But it can work. Burnett doesn't have much credibility. He is a holier than thou, pretentious snot. But he has succeeded in capturing an enigma not many people have seen. He has captured the REAL issue of the criminal justice system during his stint as a juror in a murder trial.Flash by Burnett's snide remarks about his peers [remember they ARE peers] and his digs about how he even eats better than the others and listen to his discussion of law vs. justice. It is honest, in depth and well layed out. If you are involved in the criminal justice system in any way or are interested in some of the frustrations of those who are involved in it try reading this book. It is worthwhile. And even if you hate it, it's pretty short so the pain won't last long!"
2,Pretentious,"I wanted to learn more about how juries deliberate. I did learn a little. Unfortunately, the little I learned was buried under TONS AND TONS OF PRETENTIOUS, PEDANTIC GARBAGE!!!! The author obviously has an extremely high opinion of himself that I don't share.I trudged along through the author's self-serving style because I would learn something every now and then. However, it took too much effort, for very little payoff.Even the author's photo on the book jacket was pretentious."
1,An exercise in poor jury selection,"Mr. Burnett waxes eloquent as to his intellectual prowess, devastating insights, etc. But as he admits, he made up his mind not to vote for conviction before any real deliberations began. In my view, therefore, he ""failed to deliberate"" and violated his first and most important duty as a juror.As a trial lawyer, this sort of self important doofus is exactly what we seek to exclude from jury panels.The judge had it right at the end; a jury's service is valuable, but is by no means as rigorous, dangerous or important as that of many others in this society. Mr. Burnett felt that being cooped up on a jury for a few weeks merited a book -- he should grow up."
4,Did I read the same book?,"I found this book a good read, the author an intelligent writer,refreshingly insightful. The folks who excoriate him for being self-absorbed, apparently missed the part where he owns his arrogance and isn't arrogant about it! An endearing quality. I recommend it, especially for anyone who hadn't done jury duty. I suspect (I've never done it) this is a pretty realistic view of the process. I liked it!"
1,Avoid This Book,"This is a terrible book by an atrocious author. The author is not very likable; at the start he has made up his mind about the case, so he makes fun of the other jurors for being stupid, especially the ones that don't support his position. His arrogance comes through easily, making long winded speeches to his fellow jurors and ""putting them in their place"" when they say things he doesn't like (despite his being younger than most of them).He says early on that it was his goal to ""hang the jury,"" and the only rationale he gives for that is that his whole experience in life has been academia, where the discussion essentially never ends, and he just doesn't have it in him to make such a final decision. How odd!There are no real insights into the criminal justice process, just lots of very high-brow language that sounds almost put-on. Also, he exerpts from his diary at one point--showing that even in his personal life, this fellow can only write pretensiously.Avoid this book!"
5,Essential reading for understanding patronage,"Like it or love it, you cannot avoid this book. If you are studying patron-client based systems, if you wonder what causes patronage or ""political machines"" in this country or anywhere in the world, you must start with this book. Has been out of print and has fortunately been reissued, because this is just a classic. Don't expect light, easy reading, however, or a friendly conversational style. This is academic writing at its best. The authors use examples from all over the world, and while some of the wording (about the communist systems) is out of date, their analysis is not."
4,A Great Place to Start,"I love this album. I love what he does with Bemsha Swing and the other works on the recording, pushing the tonal and rhythmic elements to their limits. I have always had difficulty with free Jazz (still do), but I like the early works of Coleman and Taylor because they are still somewhat restrained by tradition. Give it a try."
5,Nola Gove,"I bought this book for my husband. He loves it! He has been into trains since he was a child. His grandfather was an engineer, and my husband, as a child used to go with him on the train occasionally. His grandfather also bought him the complete set of Lionel Trains about 50 years ago. The store only had the display modl, so they bought the entire set and had it delivered on a tractor trailer truck directly to the house already set up on a display table. It now resides in our basement, and it is quite a conversational piece."

4,GOOD CASSETTE RECORDER FOR THE PRICE.,"THE CASSETTE PLAYER WAS LARGER THAN DESCRIBED. IT'S NOT AROUND THE SAME SIZE AS TWO CASSETTES. IT DOES WORK VERY GOOD. DOES NOT EAT UP THE CASSETTES. IT'S A TRUSTED COMPANY. THERE IS NO LED LIGHT, FOR WHEN THE BATTERY GETS LOW. THE A/C OUTLET IS VERY HANDY, LESS TROUBLE THAN A LARGE BULKY ADAPTER. THE SOUND IS VERY GOOD. RECORDS WELL AND WHEN IN THE FF OR REWIND MODES, ALSO PLAY MODE THE CASSETTE SHUTS OFF. THIS COMES IN VERY HANDY."
4,good player,I use this tape player in my classroom for use by 23 first graders. There is nothing complicated and it puts out OK sound. I'd purchase this item again if I needed to.
5,Panasonic casstte,After reading coments about this recorder on Amazon this is the one I settled on.I was not dissapointed.Great sound quality.
1,Tape doesn't eject from player,"We ordered this to play cassettes for an educational program. We were able to open it to play one of the tapes, but we were not able to eject the tape. The door will not open and we cannot get the tape out. Because of the proprietary nature of the tape, we cannot return the player until we get the tape out of the player."
1,I'm returning it,"I received my Panasonic new RQ-2102, I liked the solid look, however wasI ever surprised when I discovered it did not erase previously recordedmaterial. With further testing I found it would erase on normal bias tapes(type 1), however on higher level tapes (high CrO2), it would not erase.I tested 2 normal bias tapes and it erased OK, however on 2 high Cr02 tapesit erased little if any previously recorded material. Thats all folks."
1,Unsatisfactory customer service,"I purchased first time and last two Panasonic RQ2102 Shoe Box Recorder for my niece Renee children. The package arrived and they are nice players. I noticed that there were no AC Adapters enclosed. Had to call information for toll free number to Restockit it was not on the statement. Restockit information told me the item did not come with a AC Adapter but the unit has a female socket for it.Not satified I called Amazon and they said it was a third party seller and couldn't help me. Called Panasonic (unit does come with AC Adapter) and they said to call Amazon.I emailed Restockit and said to send the AC Adapters or I will return the two units. It has to be in 15 days or I am stuck with them.Thanks Amazon for nothing. I spend several hours of frustration at the way I was treated from Amazon, Restockit and Panasonic. From now I purchased my electronics from Best Supply.It has been a terrible experience and frustrating."
4,For people who aren't digitally inclined!,I am developing a musical act for a senior individual for whom I purchased the cassette. The songs in the act are put on tape and and make practicing and memorizing the arrangements easier. We first tried using a digital recorder. It was a disaster!
3,Wish I had looked more carefully...,"It's a great basic recorder and works in that capacity very well. I had bought for converting my cassettes to MP3 format and for that it simply isn't up to the task. It only has a single output instead of separate channel RCA jacks for left and right making anything I try and convert go from stereo to monotone. Other than my haste in purchasing, it is a solid unit for the price."
4,"good, with one glitch so far","I bought this solely to play all those wonderful cassettes I can't part with,so I haven't checked out the other features. (My 20-plus year old rack systemgave up). I was thrilled to find this product, because the 'old' technology isdisappearing so fast. Sounds good, and I cross my fingers that it holds up.Occasionally it just stops and clicks off for no apparent reason. I just hit 'play'again and it's OK. It did eat one tape, I guess it was a pretty old one.Right now it's behaving perfectly ... oooo, I LOVE this music!! Some of the tapeswere recorded from vinyl LP's, some from other tapes .. all sound fine."
2,Too cheap to last,"I'm someone who just wants an easy-to-use recorder to conduct interviews, phone interviews, the latter purpose for which I have an adapter. Fine. I bought this recorder in July 2006. I've done somewhere between 15 to 20 hours of recording total on it. Other use includes playback and cueing the rewind - the usual. Well, here it is, March, 2007, and it ate a brand new tape right in the middle of an interview. The heads are clean; the tape was new (and the rest of the tapes in the batch are fine, so I don't think it was the tape). What I think, ultimately, is that this is a cheap recorder made in China where (judging from the other reviews and my own experience) is good....when it works. But obviously, the durability and reliability are questionable."
1,Nonfunctioning cassette recorder,"When I found this cassette recorder on Amazon.com, I was delighted. I have a lot of music cassettes I like to listen to, and I tape my answering machine messages when I listen to them because my telephone answering machine deletes messages after one play-back. But when I took this cassette recorder out of its box, plugged it into a surge protector, and pushed ""record,"" the cassette reel didn't turn. When I pushed ""play,"" the cassette reel didn't turn. I tried both with batteries in, and still the cassette reel didn't turn. This cassette recorder doesn't record or play cassettes."
5,Casette Recorder/Player,"I was very pleased to find this, since I have a large library of cassettes,and much of the material is not available on CD's. It works just as well asthe one I had and discarded some time ago."
4,GOOD product,"The shoe box recorder was an excellent choice for my son. He aspires to be a rapper and it gives him the ability to develope his music in abasic, easy to operate device."
4,Panasonic Shoe box recorder/player,I was replacing one that was broken and this is just what I needed. The only difference is they removed the tone control which would be nice to have. otherwise it is great for playing cassettes.
3,Satisfied.But too Big.,"The product seemed very durable, but I ended up returning it, because it was too big and did not contain the AC adaptor. The description said at least three times that an AC adaptor was included. I was getting the recorder for my 9-year old who has taken interest in public speaking. A recorder seemed the logical thing for him to record and listen to himself, to learn his strong/weak points. From the recorder's appearance and touch, it seemed nice enough, like it might last forever, but it was just too big. I could not see my young son going about with it. Actually, maybe it was more heavy than big. But, IT ALSO DID NOT CONTAIN THE ADAPTOR. If it had the adaptor, I might have considered keeping it. But without the adaptor, it would not do. I opted for a much smaller/lighter recorder for my son. You would likely be pleased with this item if weight is not an issue and you already have the adaptor. It would be a good bargain."
3,Panasonic RQ2102 Shoe Box Recorder,"Shipping all worked well, as always. Product is a bit more cheaply made than expected, however, it works well, so far!"
2,Just OK. No Power cord came with it-UGH.,"What can you expect for $38.00 It is truly minimal. and not including a power cord is ""Lame"". Means the customer must go out and buy one separately, or ""borrow one"" from sone other item. If it is not to be included then that should be stated in the sales info. on Amazon. It obviously had a sound compression circuit of some type to avoid over driving. I don't believe this was included in the sales info.I WOULD NOT BUY THIS ITEM AGAIN."
3,Panasonic RQ2102 Cassette Recorder,The sound quality is poor. The machine itself arrived in execellant conditon in a timely manner. It does what my husband wanted it for.
2,Very low record volume,Tape speed was right on but the record volume was very low and the record path very narrow. It also did not erase a pre-recorded tape while recording.
3,very sad. not what they said it would be ( reviews ),I read the reviews and thought this was the best recorder for the money. The headphones won't work unless you pull the cord out a sixteenth of an inch. when I record voice I have to play it back full volume to here it and the quality is terrible. I was looking forward to something a little better than a pocket recorder. Now I guess I have to send it back.Wes Gustafson
4,No external mic like picture shows!,I ordered this cassette recorder with the intention of using the external mic that was shown in the picture of this item. Upon examination when it arrived it does not include any external mic. This upset me in that I would have ordered a mic or bought another cassette deck that had one included. Please be aware of this misinformation.
3,stop button does not work on rewind,I bought this tape player for my Father in Law and it is just what he wanted however when you press rewind and then stop it keeps on rewinding and you have to pull up on the rewind button to get it to stop. if you press play or fast forward and stop it stops just fine.He said he will just keep it and it will work for what he wants.
5,Bookkeeper,"Works as expected. The mic is not quite strong enough for the meeting, so will be looking for a mic. Otherwise, good product."
3,sometimes size counts,"The only inconvenience with this product is size but the purpose for which it was given to me did not require miniature size, as a matter of fact, for an older user, the controls are quite ""user friendly"" I recommend the product for stationary use."
2,A big disappointment,"I bought this tape recorder after I read a good review here. If the review was truethful, I must have gotten one from a bad production batch. With the volume set at the mid-range, I could hardly reproduce any audible sound. The volume has to be at maximum before I could hear discernible voices without putting my ear right above the speaker. It also records a lot of anoying background noise. I had bought recently an Aiwa micro-cassette tape recorder which turned out to be nearly useless. I was hoping this one, using a full size cassette and with a large speaker, would not have the problem of smaller one. But that was not the case."
2,let down,I have been a Panasonic fan for some time and ordered this recorder to replace a Radio Shack one of similar design that is no longer available. I found the recording level to be very low and found the machine generally well below my hopes for it.
5,cassette recorder works well,"This cassette recorder is easy to use, is of good quality, and is offered at a good price. Just what I needed. Cassette recorders are hard to find nowadays."
3,"Incorrect size, good for the money, shipping deficient","The tape player arrived in perfect condition, but it is bigger than described.Product Dimensions: 0.9 x 2.3 x 4.6 inches ; 4.5 ouncesThe dimensions should read:Product Dimensions: 9.0 x 2.3 x 4.6 inches ; 4.5 ouncesRemember back around 2001 when we were able to buy $40 Panasonic tape players in the USA like the ones now selling on Amazon for $120? $40 appears a little high, but compared to what they have for sale now it is good for the money.I used to be the damage inspector for UPS and they would never pay a claim on this package. The package was cushioned only on one side. The other five sides were unprotected. They could have shipped it in a different shaped box; more square than rectangular."
1,No holes for jacks,I was disappointed with this product because it didn't has the jack holes that my old recorder had but since I discarded the box I didn't send it back for credit.
4,Great recorder,"My only problem with this recorder is the weight and size... two things I knew about when I got it. I prefer a smaller recorder because it gets carried in my music bag, which is already stuffed with music folders. I have switched to a digital recorder for the size and weight reasons. Good smaller tape recorders are no longer available. This one does work, playback at the right speed, etc. So, it is a good machine for someone using it in a non carrying situation or for someone who has stronger arms than a retired lady."
4,Good..for a 20 year old product...,"I got this secondhand from a friend, and i know for a fact it was bought in the mid 1980's. Amazing that it's still being sold. Rather a simple product, sucks up a butload of power, mono sound, the sound is kind of weird sounding on music, but its probably the sheer age of the thing. If it's lasted 20 years with little care given to it, i think it's a good buy."
1,Don't bother,"The problem is not with the seller, it's with the manufacturer. This recorder is a piece of junk. Panasonic used to make the best tape recorders, I used them in my work for over 30 years. Now with 'Branding', you may be buying the same garbage no matter whose name is on the box. I gave it one star because Amazon insisted. I couldn't give it zero."
3,cassette tape recorder not compact,"The device is too large and cumbersome. There are a number of products, including those made by Panasonic, that are smaller and more compact that work just as well."
3,RQ-2102 discontinued by Panasonic,"I wanted some additional information about the product and - long story short - it was discontinued about a year ago. However, the Panasonic website lists it as still available from some distributors (but no retail or online dealers).So if you really want/need one, get it while you can.(Interpret my 3-star rating to mean ""neutral"".)"
1,cassette recorder,I returned it because it didn't have or offer a external microphone that could be inserted on the side. The built-in is okay but I rather have the other one.
2,"Hard to sprout, old?","The seeds had debris in the bag, so you will need to clean it all out. Mostly was disappointed that about 1/2 the seeds did NOT sprout! Tried another batch and the same result. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SUPPLIER!"
5,great service,"Got seeds fast. Didn't really have instructions but thats ok, I put them in my sprouter like other seeds and they did find, made good size sprouts in about 5 days. Tried them in dirt also and that worked great, but was a little messier to harvest. Great value, and sunflower sprouts are so good!"
2,Sprouts with hulls.,"We have bought five types of sprouts from this seller and have tried four of them. Those four have sprouted well, but the sunflower seeds still have their hulls.Therefore, when sprouting these sunflower seeds, each sprout has to be removed from its hull to be eaten. It would be better to buy hulled sunflower seeds for sprouting and not to use these."
4,Jazz Messengers reunion sparks outstanding recording.,"Lee Morgan and Jackie McLean star on this 6-piece ensemble session. Blue Note assembled a band for this session which looked like a reunion of Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers. Lee Morgan, Jackie McLean, Curtis Fuller, and of course Art Blakey all star on this CD. Only McCoy Tyner on piano somehow missed playing with Art's group. I like the writing on this session. The group's unity suggests rehearsal and mutual interest in achieving great results. Lee hit a groove in the mid-60's, recording several great sessions. Hearing him play with McCoy is a special treat."
4,Very informative collector's guide,"This new Miller's Guide is a very special one. Leyla Maniera and David Agnew present a various range of soft toys, classified in several chapters as animals, disney characters, comic characters, oddities, manufacterers, care & restoration. Many of the described toys are very unusual and you won't know many of them from other collector's guides. Beside nice photos, the descriptions contains informations about the manufacter, the history of origin and a valuation. This is the only point I would like to criticize: the valuations are not very helpful.But summing up, it may be said that this soft toy guide is highly recommended!"
3,Don't let this book fool you,"This is mainly towards the high end soft toy collector. Very good book, too small, too little information but packs a punch!"
4,"Hilarious Movie, Politically Incorrect, Some Outstanding Performances","""Semi-Tough"" is not a movie for everyone. For those who love sports, sick humor and love the politically incorrect, this is definitely your movie. Dan Jenkins (suthor) makes great fun of pro football and the preliminaries leading to the Super Bowl. While the movie is about a Texas team (the Dallas Cowboys?), the foibles are applicable to most pro teams. Sex, boozing, and offbeat behavioral science are the ingredients, Jill Clayburgh, Robert Preston,Burt Reynolds and Kris Kristopherson are the players and they are downright fun, if a tad unbelievable at times (remember, this is a spoof). While it fails to reach the hilarity of the book, this movie provides more than its share of laughs, many giggles, and some downright guffaws. It is not for the politically correct or weak of heart!"
4,self-help revealed,"I'm only giving this four stars instead of five. It's not high film art like say Deliverance but it does serve a purpose. If you or a loved one or friend is getting sucked up into the latest self-help guru or movement like the Law of Attraction or Wayne Dyer this is a must see. Semi-Tough parodied Est and many of these things. If you ever considered paying for your ""special"" mantra this is for you. It is an incredibly funny parody of these movements and gurus. My favorite scene is when Burt Reynolds attends the seminar to ""pull its pants down"". You are supposed to be in the seminar room and not leave to go to the bathroom. It's the classic cult brainwashing technique of humiliation. But Burt has strapped one of these hunters pee bottles to his leg and you hear the tinkle into the bottle has he has this big grin on his face."
2,Not as good as when I first saw it.,"Its okay, but should I have bought it on DVD after having it on VHS?"
4,Josh McDowell's Evidence for Christianity,"This book is chock-full of detailed information about the historical and documentary arguments for the truth of the Bible. I was looking for a book that would explain why scholars consider the Bible reliable, with specific evidence and well-rounded information, and it fits the bill. Other less informative works would be Lee Stroebel's ""Case for Christ"" or ""Case for Faith"", and some of Josh's other shorter works. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to increase his/her knowledge about the basis for the reliability of the Bible."
5,Scholarly and honest.,"To be honest the book is ""loaded"" with so much information it overwhelmed me a bit.I guess I expected a more concise demonstration of evidence.If I were an atheist or skeptic this book would raise questions that would not be easily answered in my mind.Hopefully it will persuade some to believe in Jesus Christ as the Son of God."
5,i really enjoyed WANDERER,"I would like to add something to the excellent and perceptive reviews above. What came through so strongly is that life is messy, yet Hayden's remarkable self awareness didn't seem to help him. This is a fascinating look inside a big life. I found it valuable."
5,WANDERER by Sterling Hayden - Great Reading! Loved it!,"I had no idea that the actor, Sterling Hayden, had even written a book let alone was a successful author. I heard about his book WANDERER on Turner Classic Movies, an autobiography written in the form of a novel. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I hated for it to come to an end. He was a fascinating man who lead a very interesting life as a seaman and undercover soldier in World War II to the extent of even changing his name. His first wife, Madeleine Carrol, also was captivating as she was an actress in Hitchcock films as well as working with the French Underground taking her husband's alias. She had about forty (40) French girls in her care during World War II. I highly recommend the very enjoyable WANDERER !"
5,"""Wanderer""'s luminous insight and top notch, muscular prose","Despite being marketed as a maritime book, ""Wanderer"" is as much a description of one man's inner wanderings as it is a travelogue of Hayden's travel to Tahiti.Throughout, Hayden comes off as a resolute man of principle and insight.I have read the book three times and always glean something new from it. Highly recommended."
5,wanderers,"""Wanderer"" is not just one man's tale. A schooner bum from Maine, initially wooed and later repulsed by the glamour of celebrity, caused to reevaluate his own ethics. It is a tragic and nostalgic glimpse into the human side of the land of the Titans. We visit both the hidden decadence of Hollywood that turns people into playthings and the personal desperation that drives Hayden to kidnap his own children for a two year trip through the South Pacific.We are also, as sailors, given a sea-level view of those we have only come to know by name and legend: Irving Johnson, Spike Africa, Warwick Tompkins' Wanderbird, and Sausalito's NoNameBar. More than anything, Hayden reaffirms that, like ourselves, they were but men: simple, flawed, and determined."
4,Journeys,"This book is as convoluted as its author. It maintains a flow of semi-stream-of-consciousness from start to finish, and what emerges are the memoirs of a man whose love of seafaring and considerable self-deprecation (""self-loathing"" is a little too strong a term) has brought him to a sea voyage to Tahiti with a pick-up crew and his four children in violation of a court order. Hayden's story is it's own animal, going from the coasts of Massachusetts and Maine, to the forests of Yugoslavia, to courtrooms and congressional chambers and movie sets and finally to the high seas and South Pacific islands with a strain of fatalism and regret throughout. It should make for a downer of a read; instead, I found myself staying up and turning the pages to see what happened next. A great book."
5,Wanderer,"A griping story that reads like fiction. Hayden is a ""one of a kind"" spirit that lives life to the fullest. He wants good things for the world and lives up to his character of being an iconoclast. A great read for sailors or romantics who dream of being before the mast and finding lifes' meaning out on the sea."
5,A most interesting (and complex) man... a Great autobiography!,I keep re-reading this book as the years pass. It's an honest self-appraisal from a basically shy man. What a life he led! And what an engaging writing style he had ... for his first and only nonfiction book! Awaiting it in the e-book format!!!
2,Limited edition,"A person who likes sailing would like this book. I bought this in order to read about Hayden's experiences during the McCarthy era, but that covered only a few pages. To that extent, this was disappointing."
4,From the deep woods to civilization,"There are certainly not enough autobiographies of Native Americans, and few that can compare with Eastman's story and journey to find civilization. As Eastman follows Christianity and the White Man's Civilization, he finds himself realizing the paradox of the two worlds. Upon returning to a more civilized world, he gives a captivating look at how Jesus was an Indian and how different the White world and Native American world was during his life. A perfect self-enlightenment book."
3,NightBlaster Floating Fish-N-Lite on Amazon,"Recently both NightBlaster Floating Fish-N-Lite on AmazonPros:* Bulb is one solid piece. The glass you see on the picture is actually a front of the bulb (not just glass cover) which means it's sealed by design* Has in-line 15Amp fuseCons:* The one I received consumed about 3A (which is actually matching to the label on the box: <4A)* Produced light is uneven, when projected to the wall looks like flattened ellipse and far from circle"
1,Died after one charge,This part was very inexpensive and worth what I paid. It charged one battery and died.
5,Chrged and Ready,This is exactly what I needed. The camera battery was still good just needed charging. Arrived in 2 short days. GREAT!
2,didnt last,this item was purchased around September last year and it doesnt work anymore it didnt even last 5 months. it fails to charge the batteries and nothing happnes when u plug it into the wall outlet.. better look for a better alternative dont buy it wont last you it is clearly a cheap product
3,Was shipped the wrong product,"While the price was fantastic, I was a bit disappointed because I was shipped the WRONG battery charger (the one I rec'd was not the one I ordered). I did notice that several other reviewers complained of the same issue. Not sure why, but I didn't bother to return it for refund/exchange."
3,Early Earring,"If you're looking for hard gelled performances like Radar Love or Twilight Zone, this isn't it. But this is an excellent example of Golden Earrings transition from a poppish early sixties sound into a mainstream mid-sixties rock sound. Not quite there but almost. Hays and Kooymans writing skills start to develope here. As with all collectors of Golden Earring this is a must have."
3,Classic Italo Dance CD,"This is Raf's compiliation CD of his english spoken dance singles from the early to mid 80's. His single, ""Self Control"" was later sung by Laura Branigan (who turned it into a huge dance song in 1984). Raf's version was basically only known in Europe. Still, it's a great tune. ""Change Your Mind"" is one of the best songs on the CD in my opinion. Unfortunately, the singles on this CD are not extended versions. I think it would have made for a more interesting listen. Another great song is, ""I Don't Want to Lose You"" It's a bouncy, yet quite sleazy song that gets you involved. I only gave this CD 3 stars because I felt that the singles should have been in their extended dance form. Otherwise, you will not be disappointed by this CD."
2,wire tracker,"A co-worker of mine has one of these and I was so impressed with it that I had to have one. On receiving mine I tested it and it worked great. A few days later I needed to use it and found that the batteries in the receiver had already discharged. I replaced the batteries but it wouldn't turn on. I then got that tell tale electrical burn smell from the receiver. I disassembled the receiver to find that the chip had overheated and started to melt the surrounding plastic. I'm not sure what went wrong, but the battery polarity etc was correct. Its at a great price, so the return shipping costs don't really make a warranty claim worthwhile. My co-worker's is still working great, I guess I just had bad luck."
3,Wire Tracker,"It worked fairly well, but I was tracing wires in an RV in a bundle of wires. I found that there was substantial crosstalk, so tracking down the one wire was not as easy as I had hoped it would be. Once I found the right terminal post and I could touch the metal, it was obvious it was the right one. But trying to touch the insulation to determine whether it was the right wire didn't work very well. I did find it useful though."
2,"This is not a tool, it is a toy","This item attracted me because of the price and brand name. Big mistake. For 30$ more I could have had a Fluke and not been out the 35 bucks this cost me, and been ahead of the game.This product is a waste of time for a professional electrician, low volt electrician, ect. spend a little more and get a quality product.It will tone out a cat5 or phone jack if you are within 15 feet MAX, with a very low signal. If you have a bunch of wires all in the same room, which is smaller than 15 feet, and you need to find the ends, this product may do the trick. BUT, this is all it will do. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it does work as designed."
1,You get what you pay.,for every day professional use go with something more durable and proven to work well. The button on the probe is small and difficult to keep in the on position. It is soft even at the loudest setting. Coworker has the progressive brand and could pick up the tone almost a foot away as with this one you had to actually be touching the cable and going up and down to find the tone. I would only recommend this if you only had one cable to find in your lifetime.
4,Pleased with product,"The unit found the wires in my house and a friend's house which had been covered by drywall installers. As I learned in other reviews, the unit works best without interference from other entergized lines. Additionally, performance is much better if an earth ground is established. I was able to locate the end of the two romex cables within about three inches. Given the price, the unit was amazing."
3,OK. Do not expect wonders.,"Works as stated, but sensitivity is not great. Do not use it near active power wires. Active power wires generate enough interference to mask normal operation of the unit."
5,Big time saver - pays for itself first use,"I had a dead phone jack in one of my bedrooms. I have multiple jacks in each room and they all run to a patch panel in the basement. I hooked this up to the jack, walked down to the basement despite dozens and dozens of lines I was able to pick the line right out. Turns out one of the wires wasn't punched down all the way. I have no idea how I would have ever found and fixed the line without this little lifesaver. I would have either moved the phone to another jack or would have run an extension. With this little beauty I didn't have to compromise!"
4,works,Works for the purpose I purchased it for. The cost of shipping made had me thinking if it was that good of a deal
3,barely audible....,"Managed to pick up electrical source through plaster ceilings in an old home . downside is that even on maximum volume,this device is barely audible . you do have a flashing light but it would be nice to hear the sound as well ."
4,"Incredible, shocking tool for the price.",All I can say is for the price i am amazed the toner and tracer works so well. Since purchasing and receiving the tool I have used it several time and didn't experience any problems what so ever. My advice is to try this tool before purchasing the very expensive similar tools.
2,Very Disappointing :(,"It didnt answer any questions. They didnt even have any interviews with James Earl Ray, and he had all the answers. Trying to make the public believe that JER couldnt have made that shot from the bathroom window. How stupid do they think we are. They conducted tests and anyone couldve made that shot. The only truth on this tape was the pure hatered Hoover Had for MLK. That letter that was sent to MLK was just awful."
1,Israel Comes Out of the Closet,"This film is a pro-gay film masquerading as a thriller. While Israel struggles for survival as a Jewish State, Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni wants to substitute Israel as a a homosexual haven in the eastern Mediterranean. This film should help and please the Europeans, too."
1,walk on palestinians,"First and foremost I would like to say that this is a lousy gay flick, not a movie about healing the wound of the holocaust. What I got out of this movie was that any one who wrongs Jews or Israel for that matter is gay and is deserving of death. Here the Israeli agent Eyal (Lior Ashkenazi) is an honorable patriotic hetero struggling to forgive the gay German and his gay Palestinian lover. The movie ends w/ Eyal forgiving the gay German but w/ no hint whether he will forgive his gay Palestinian neighbors.p.s. strange that the Dome of the Rock mosque is on the front cover!"
5,Brilliant movie!,"This is a great movie and one that actually deserved the awards that it won. The characters are developed and interesting - the viewer starts to care about them. They are not stereotyped, but individuals. The film is a mixture of action, good dialogue and moving emotional scenes. I have shown it to all of my friends (Jewish and non Jewish) and they have all loved it and wanted to watch it again to savour the tiny details which they may have missed the first time.It is filmed in a mixture of Hebrew, English and German.Lior Ashkenazi is now a sex symbol in his native Israel and after watching this film you will see why - a really engaging, empathetic star.Highly recommended!"
5,WALK ON WATER,"Excellent film, including acting by all involved. Can keep you glued to your seat waiting for something to happen - and it does."
5,Beautiful,"SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!This is just a comment on the one moment that to me earns this film five stars. When the main charecter leaves the grndfathers room and passes the grand son, the fact that they say ABSOLUTLY NOTHING was the most satisfying film moments I have ever felt. It as so beaututiful to see a a driector with the confidence to just let the men be men and remain strong and silent, so perfect."
5,A Story Worth Watching,"An excellent film from Israel, but could have been any country that feels on the brink of ""near-extinction"". The story is told by using flashbacks and it takes awhile to come to grips with the protagonist and what he is trying to do. You see him change before your eyes and the actors all work so well to make this happen."
5,A mark of excellence,"To my belief, this movie is a real example of a modern masterpiece where a huge volume of information presented expertly: I cannot omit recalling and comparing it with some other Jewish/Israel related films.Rather less action-depicting and much scarce on political controversy than ""Munich (Full Screen Edition)"", definitely more realistic and leaving a room to imagination than ""When Do We Eat?"", incorporating eventually predominant attitude and mixed approach to fellow Israeli-Arabs as characters in ""The Holy Land"" & ""Paradise Now"", much less sexually explicit than by the same producers ""Yossi & Jagger"" and too many other Israeli blockbuster dramas, it is a sort of a movie I feel must be seen a couple of times to grasp a depth of meanings memorised.Itself, return to a seen movie to watch once more is a mark of excellence created by Israelis on Israeli reality, Israel place in and interaction with a world, and global issues as they seen by the Jews of the Jewish State definitely."
4,Ouch on the headphones,"The quality of the cassette player itself is very, very good. It is extremely durable.But, as other reviewers have indicated, the headphones are terrible. They are hard unyielding plastic and flat out hurt.If you buy this player, plan on buying some other headphone. I bought PHILLIPS #sbcHS303 for $10.00 at Target. They are 3-way flexible and adjustable to your ear. The sound is very good and they are comfortable."
3,"adequate, but not great","I ordered this unit to replace a Sony walkman that died after about 4 years (a relatively long life for a walkman, in my experience). For the money, I can't really complain. The sound quality is quite good; nevertheless, the bass boost is inferior to the Sony's, the controls are harder to use when the unit is ""belt clipped"" to my waistband, and the earphones are not as comfortable. The lack of an auto-stop feature is also disappointing.On the flip side, the earphones stay in place much better than did the Sony's, and the unit is more lightweight and gets more hours out of one battery than the Sony did out of two. It's a recent purchase, so I can't comment on its durability.Overall, it's perfectly adequate for working out at the gym, but I must say that when it dies I think I'll go back to the Sony."
5,My wife loves it!,"I gave this model to my wife as a replacement for her Sony player . She likes it better, and is completely satisfied with it. It is amazing that it runs on only one AA cell, and lasts as long as it does. The sound is very good, and the only downfall is, the head-set gets uncomfortable after awhile."
4,a decent product,This is a very decent product. I would have given only 3 stars but the headphones are great. For anyone looking to buy a walkman for personal use this one is great. Though a little pricy.
2,Two strikes and you're out!,"The first problem I had with the product was the earphone plug. When it rotates in the plug hole the radio signal breaks up or completely disappears. Returned that one and got another one....... Well, on the second one I attempted to preset a radio station. To do this you need to press the ""hold"" button. I follow the instructions and the ""hold"" button got stuck. Couldn't get the radio to switch off or change stations because the ""hold"" was broken. I removed the battery for more than 30 seconds. Guess what??? The ""hold"" was still there. This meant that I couldn't get a radio station on because the ""hold"" kept the radio off. I am not getting another one. These incidents have occurred within the past four days. I have used the item less then 20 minutes and already all these breakdowns."
2,No auto stop,This unit has no auto stop on the tape player. A must for any auto reverse. I also do not like the rubber setting selectors they stick. I wanted a decent functional tape player and this wasn't it. For the money very disappointing.
3,The headphones are a nightmare!!!,"My ears were in excruciating pain after trying to stuff the awkwardly shaped headphones into my ear canal. I figured maybe it's because I have small ears so I gave them to my girlfriend who has a fairly large inner ear area. The same thing happened to her. The actual walkman is pretty cool, especially the battery life. Just expect to buy a new pair of headphones before considering purchasing it."
1,Over Priced and a poor performer,"I bought this TV back in the fall of 2005 for 500 bucks. Frankly, the picture quality is fairly poor using a direct cable feed, it's fuzzy and indistinct. The child lock feature is fairly intrusive as well. Basically it's 500 bucks for a lousy TV. The only reason I bought it was for its slim profile. I didn't have the room for a conventional tube TV which would have cost me a fifth of the price of this TV. Plus, the TV failed within 4 months. I had to beg Magnavox to cover this TV under warranty. They give you a paltry 90 days. That's a joke. I highly recommend you look elsewhere."
2,save your money,"This truck is not what they tell you it is, it's a nice truck but not all that they tell you it isbut it well do may 3 year old grandson."
4,Great dumptruck!,"Solid constructed dumptruck. Only problem is the dumper is higher then the matching loader. Wish the loader raised higher then the dumper for better play...for my son, not me :)"
4,Sturdy...,"My son like this toy. The only thing that I think that is wrong with the toy is the paper design that goes around top of the truck (red lines). These were peeling off when we got the truck. Likely, that part will not stick around for long. Otherwise, the truck seem sturdy."
4,Not a Nazi in sight in splendid Holmes mystery,"After three films in which Sherlock Holmes battled the Nazis, even Universal must have grown tired of their gimmicky attempt to ""modernize"" the Great Detective. With ""Sherlock Holmes Faces Death,"" Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce are back on more familiar turf and solve a mystery having absolutely no connection to World War II.For the first time in the series, a film doesn't merely credit a story by Arthur Conan Doyle, screenwriter Bertram Millhauser actually makes use of one, ""The Musgrave Ritual,"" a traditional murder mystery involving an old family curse. The story gives director Roy William Neill plenty of opportunities to pour on the atmosphere that is the series' best attribute, aside from stars Rathbone and Bruce, of course.With this entry, the series greatly improved, and greater adventures were still to come for the famous detective from Baker Street.Brian W. Fairbanks"
5,Favorite.,"This is my favorite Sherlock Holmes movie. It features a gloomy old English mansion, an ancient riddle, a locked shadowy crypt, lots of thunder and lightning, a puzzling series of murders, and plenty of suspects to keep you guessing. It also has Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. What more could you ask for-a perfect movie to watch on a dark and stormy night!"
4,Hello! What's this?,"Rathbone finally slicks back his hair, and propaganda takes a backseat to an atmospheric whodunit in one of the best of the Universal series. For a quick programmer this one is especially well played by a cast that portrays the war-weary veterans stuck in a convalescent home in the countryside. Nigel Bruce's Dr. Watson buffoons around a bit, but we also see his medical expertise for a change.Holmes' final homily isn't specific to the war this time, but a good one, nonetheless, if a little out of character.Solidly entertaining."
4,"Suberb Cinematography, Transfer","This is a very entertaining Sherlock Holmes film with some of the best - maybe THE best - camera-work I've seen in the Basil Rathbone-Nigel Bruce series. It looks especiallly great, too, on these remastered discs.The photography was better than the story, which was disappointing only in that it was too easy to spot the killer. Heck, even I found it no problem, so it must have been too easy.The characters were interesting and all quite different. Some were mental patients who had suffered from World War II. Miburn Stone played the lone American and I didn't recognize the man who went on to play ""Doc"" in the long- running hit TV series ""Gunsmoke."" However, his voice sounded familiar."
1,Second only to the Hound of the Baskerville's,"Sherlock Holmes Faces Death is a very close second to the Hound of the Baskerville's in terms of viewing enjoyment. Rathbone is excellent as SH and with all due respect to Jeremy Britt, he does Holmes without the fussiness- something not found in Conan Doyles writing but 'affected' by Britt."
3,A Prequel to Greatness,"This album is very 80s in every sense of the word. Strong keyboards, drums. Guitars were still on the back burner in this one, but the albums following (Hotline, etc.) get porgressively better! A good first effort. This turned out to be my favorite band of all time by the early 90s."
4,Portable Cassette Recorder,We have had several Panasonic models of this type of product in the last fifteen years. This particular model has been very reliable and easy to use. We use it to record class room instructions and to play music for dance lessons and to dub practice tapes.
5,"Great cd, Classic",I love this Cd I used to listen to it every christmas growing up. BUT I about puked when I saw a wanker on here trying to sell the audio cd for 88 dollars. what a scumbag. I thought 32 dollars is way too much but 88 dollars. do your self a favor and download the MP3 for 8 dollars and burn to cd.
3,Deconstructed Lennon,"Mostly slowed down and spread out to make almost new age music out of it. Sometimes illuminating, sometimes frighteningly close to elevator music."
2,Many stories,"This book is an interesting read, but it seems the author couldn't decide which story to tell. His own? Joe Ehrmann's? The Gilman football team's? He goes deepest into Joe's but keeps hinting at his own transformation. That led me to expect more than I found in the last chapter."
3,"Good book, but...","As an elite, very expensive private school, Gilman seemed all wrong as a setting for Joe and Biff's program. Yes, Gilman gives financial aid for their token inner city kids, but realistically most of the kids who need help go to public schools. Of course all private and parochial schools say they do not recruit athletes, but this book has Bif admitting that he heard about a stud black quarterback in the inner city and he goes to their home and inquires about the possibility of the kid going to Gilman! What hyprocrisy! I just thought the coaches were kind of delusional. The kids too, because 95% of them grew up very privileged. Want a real story??? Try Cleveland Glenville High School and the job Ted Ginn Sr has done there with those kids; inner city black kids with limited means. Don't get be wrong, the message of the book was powerful, but focusing the book on rich kids at an elite private school seems to knock some of the luster off the book."
4,A coaching book that's not just for coaches.,"This book needs to be read by every youth worker and parent in America. Jeffery Marx does a brilliant job of showcasing the ministry of Joe Ehrmann, former NFL Player turned high school coach. Joe's approach to the problems of dysfunctional families and poverty are right on target. I wonder how many people would have heard of Joe had it not been for this book. Jeffery Marx does a great job of not just exposing Joe Ehrmann and his personal journey but also his own struggles with coming to terms with his own father.One of the best lines in the book is when a parent approaches Joe at the beginning of the high school football season and asks, ""What kind of team do you think we'll have this year?"" Joe quips, ""I guess we'll find out in about 20 years."" Ehrmann's approach to coaching is one that should be shared by anyone who coaches young people. We need to be concerned about how our children develop as people and not just players."
5,Must read for Males,"Though this book may lead you to think of this as all about football, it's not. It's about how men related to their fathers and how that relationship affects all other relationships. I've given away almost 10 copies of this book. Once you read it you'll want every man you know to read it too. A must read..."
1,Worst Book Ever,"This book is a terrible assumption of life. It goes along with a misconception all Americans know or are deceived by. This misconception is that sports are a necessity. Sports are not a necessity, contrary to every moment of this book. People claiming sports teach you character are severely incorrect, most jocks are selfish, stuck-up, and cocky. I should know, mentoring over-confident jocks. Over all, an awful, uninteresting read."
5,A must read book,"It has been such a long time since anything I have read has spoken to me like this book did. The writing itself was run of the mill, usual sports cliches (some parts read like a sports illustrated piece) - but the message is its strength. After reading it, this book would not leave my consciousness. Days later I had to go back and read passages again, Joe Ehrman's ""Building Men for Others"" concepts invading my thoughts at all hours. Honestly, I do not even know how this book ended up on my bookshelf. One day I needed something to read and found it sitting there. Only hours later I am left dumbfounded, reflecting on who I am and ultimately determining that I could be doing much more with my life and perhaps finding satisfaction I never knew possible. Please read the book, you'll be glad you did."
4,Great guide for all coaches,"I recommend this book to any coach seeking to ""make a difference"" in the lives of his/her players but doesn't exactly know what that means. Coaches hope to be good influences on their players just like fathers hope to be the same for their children. The only problem is that that desire often lacks a blueprint.By first defining true masculinity and then showing how one coaching staff teaches it to its players, this book helps coaches see that much needed blueprint. For coaches, the true measure of success for a team's season isn't known until 20 years down the road - if you're interested in that type of success, this book is for you."
5,Boys to Men,"ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR!! There may not be a more importat issue in todays society. We often talk about how athletics is an important training ground for life. It has been never been better demonstrated than by these coaches and this writer. Mr. Marx follows one season of a very special high school football team and the life lessons the team's coaches impart to their athlete's. This book is special. It should be read by every coach , parent and athlete."
5,True masculinity & a life of purpose,"This book has had revolutionary impact on several guys who friends of mine in re-assessing their lives, waking up their heart, and firing their spirits to desire deeper relationships with other men, with their sons, their fathers, with God, and to leave a legacy about something greater than themselves. Great as part of a men's study group, book club, and especially for men who find themselves lonely, trying to prove themselves over & over, and yearning for deeper connection with their own father, the next generation, and God"
3,Real deal.,"It may be helpful to everyone to know that there are two Sai Babas. The one that is suspected of sexual offence and fake miracles is Sathya sai baba. The other one, the one this film is about is shirdi Sai baba. He's the real deal and doesnt get himself driven round in a huge car.Film is only really good if you speak hindi."
4,good nascar game,"I am a big NASCAR fan and I was really excited to get this game. Overall the game is really good. There are, however, a few minor things that I would have liked better. First off I the biggest thing for me was the fact that all of the COT cars look EXACTLY the same. They all pretty much look like chevy's top me so when your driving for lets say Roush Racing it looks like your driving a Chevy. Another thing that I would have liked was the addition of some of the Busch specific tracks, i.e. Nashville, Indianapolis Raceway Park, and others that they have actually included in previous games. All in all this game is fun and unless you are a diehard fan like I am these little things shouldn't bother you."
3,"Decent Physics, Poor A.I.","The hype about the difficulty of the phyisics of Nascar 08 is true, it is very realistic and even changes throughout the game based on sun going down tire wear ect. However the A.I. was poorly written. The computer opponents seem to have no brains especially when it comes to pitstops. Every time a pit stop occurs whether under green or yellow chaos ensues. It gets frustrating when your wanting the smooth realisim that goes into an actual Nascar stop. Other than this the game is aight. Not for non racing fans for sure."
2,little has changed but the cover,"I couldnt wait to play 08 after having suffered through 07 version. Unfortunately , very very little has changed this year. Every thing from the in car audio from the pit crew to the graphics are exactly the same as last year. Its a huge dissapointment. Even the victory lane driver celebration is the EXACT same as last year. You can chose your own driver based on last year's choices. I wish I could return it. I still say the 06 game was better ."
1,bad career mode,this game is fun on superspeedways but the rest stink.for one thing the new career mode is lkame the old fight to the top career mode was way better! also the breaking help even on high barely works. but it is fun to to turn of traction control and ABS and spin at daytona. another problem is there is no make and model on trucks or COTS. do not buy this game and get 09 because it has the old career mode where u start in truck and wsork your way up to cup.let me imply again the 08 career mode is reely bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!EA all ur sports games r good accept 4 this one!!!!very bad game
2,Just Me Or Hard To Handle?,Was very excited to finally see this game coming out. Was very disappointed to finally play it. I am not a long time gamer but have played for a while and I found the car almost impossible to handle. Nothing I did seemed to help. Stopped after an hour frustrated. Has anyone found a fix or a tip yet? It's only been available for 2 days to the public so I know it may to too soon to ask but...??
3,Tough Steering,"I was a little dissapointed with the handling of the car. No matter how much I adjusted the controls and calibrated the sensitivity the car would still oversteer really easy. As for the rest of the game play and racing format it was very good, as well as the graphics. But overall without being able to control the car as well as the previous years the steering was by far not up to the standard as it used to be."
3,"A good stealth weapon, not a battle weapon.","Very sharp, very nice looking swords, but will not survive against regular sword like a ninja/samuri sword."
3,"Great books, POOR edition...","I love these three Stephen King books. I bought this as soon as I saw that it existed, in an effort to get more of my books in hardback editions.That being said, I have to say that I'm very disappointed in this edition. I'm only about a hundred pages into 'Salem's Lot, and I've already noticed several glaring editorial errors (missing periods, blatant spelling errors). The most amazing thing I've found so far is that page 241 is printed AGAIN on page 242! At first I thought perhaps I was just not concentrating, but a quick comparison of the two pages reveals that they are indeed the same page, with a different page number at the bottom.The books are easily 5 stars a piece. And the fact that you can get these combined in hardback at such a low price is great! But be aware that you're getting exactly what you pay for, which is a compilation of three great books with slipshod editing, which can be very distracting."
5,sweet deal,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom. She almost had his complete works except for these three! It was a perfect gift! It would also be a great way to introduce a reader with these three classics!
4,king rocks,"i would recommend any book my king, but these are 3 of the best that every reader should expereicne"
5,An excellent book!!,Dr. Hart's assessment of panic anxiety disorders hits the nail on the head!! The book gave me the necessary information to get on the right track. The book is very well thought out and Dr. Hart expresses his Christian perspective on these disorders. The book is a must for anyone suffering from panic anxiety!
1,THANKS FOR THE WARNINGS!,"This ""review"" is to thank the others who've read and reviewed the book. If ""Arch"" recommends medications for anxiety, then his title has no credibility. Most medications for anxiety are highly addictive, and the one or two that aren't, don't really work very well. But most importantly, these pills AREN'T CURES for anxiety. They're TREATMENTS. When you stop the pills the anxiety comes right back. And as for the Christian perspective -- don't get me started. All I can say is thanks for the warnings!"
3,Beautiful.... but problematic,"I have two reactions to this album. One is to recommend it highly: it has some of Wayne Shorter's chewiest and prettiest compositions--try ""Angola"" or ""Lost""--and a knockout lineup: Tony Williams' drumming in particular is a joy. But there's one real problem here: the recording was badly botched (probably explaining why such an otherwise fine album was only released in the 1970s after Shorter had left Blue Note), and you'll note distortion on all tracks when the soloists or ensembles ""peak"" in volume. Unless you can mentally edit out the annoying buzz that results, you're better off trying other Shorter Blue Note discs. I'm willing to ignore this problem & concentrate on the music, as will other Shorter aficionados, but the casual listener will be put off."
2,Worst DVD Transfer Ever!,"The quality of this DVD makes The Last Emperor transfer actually look good by comparison. Yi-Yi was filmed in 35mm, but to see it on DVD you'd swear it was done in 8mm. On top of that, the images are jittery, not smoothe.The people who oversaw the production of this DVD, Maryann Manelski and Kimberly Rubin, have a lot of explaining to do."
3,Un-Playable,"Not sure why 2 of same DVD of this title ""Yi Yi"" Blu-ray Criterion Collection (Amazon sent another one free when the 1st. wouldn't play) - I tried both in 2 different Blu-ray players- I even upgraded one of them (received the firmware upgrade CD directly from manufacturer), to no avail. It went as far as the menu with its sound but wouldn't play the movie. Does anyone know what could be wrong?Since this review is actually NOT for the movie itself as I haven't been able to watch it so I give it 3 stars to be ""fair""- I like to be able to watch it - perhaps someone who reads this can give me some pointers?"
3,"Beautiful Story, Ugly Transfer",This is a beautiful story and it is beautifully told by Edward Yang in this near 5-star film. Unfortunately the DVD transfer is among the worst I've seen and it detracts tremendously from the overall experience.
5,Only Taiwanese can understand its fully meaning,"It's about a story in an ordinary or even modle Taiwan family. Here people laugh,here people cry.Every single scene is just like what we are.This touches me most. I think you'll feel the warmth in it.(there's even a scene in my highschool,how small Taiwan is)"
3,"Great movie, bad DVD","This is 5 star movie but this particular transfer is really terrible. It's worse than a VCD. I am so dissappointed with it that I have to give it away immediately after I watched it.If you wanna own this movie, buy the the Hong Kong release by Winson at 25% the Fox Lorber price and get a considerably better transfer in letterbox format with English subtitles.Having said the above, I wish to commend Fox Lorber for their efforts in making such excellent movies available for international audiences. They must however improve on their transfers which those movies deserve."
3,Long And Quietly Observant--But Poor Quality Transfer,"I try to go into every film with an open mind, but this film is so well regarded that I was expecting to be blown away. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. The poor quality of the transfer was a disappointment and a distraction, and it is a film that requires patience.The film is quietly observent, nice and thoughtful. Very polite, if that's a way to describe a film. I really enjoyed the early scenes where all the family, neighbors, and friends interacted. This slice-of-life convergence of many different people and stories is a dramatic device that I generally respond to.However, in the second half, the emphasis shifted to two main characters--and I found this a little less interesting. Clocking in at just under 3 hours, I'll admit there were times that I looked at my watch in this half.I did think that the ending was smart and sweet without being overly sentimental, and I think the film had more ""hits"" than ""misses"". KGHarris, 9/06."
3,A nice film if you hold on!,"The film drags at the beginning to a degree that I had to keep myself from stopping it many times if it weren't for the money I had spent on it! Later on as the events began to unfold, I started enjoying the film. It is a nice and touching story about a family in China, depicting human deepest interactions on all levels starting with the little clever boy Yang-Yang (whos words and ideas I found most amusing) to his father who's on the verge of losing his business and relives an old love story.The worst thing about the DVD edition is the poor quality of the picture. It's really disappointing. The translation is neither good nor clear, and many times you can't tell who is saying what.Bottom line: a nice story but it drags too much, very poor quality of the film transfer."
2,Ai-Yi Yi!,"The problem with Yi Yi is not with the director or the cast -- it's the fact that the story is not truthful enough to make this style of film work. To present a work that goes on for almost 3 hours, and never see one truthful moment until the end -- which turned out to be pure cliche, by the way -- was excruciating. Yet the actors did a tremendous job with what they had. And, The film calls to mind Kieslowski as the theme is subtly reflected in the film technique as well as dialogue. Unfortunately the good elements are wasted with all of the over-long scenes where the characters are not allowed to take their actions through to their logical conclusion. Perhaps if they did, Mr. Yang's film would have been too controversial. Maybe this film is an example of where the Chinese culture is right now, as it decides what to cast off as this ancient society transforms into its next age of growth."
2,No thank you.,"I found Yi Yi to be a tedious film, at times the action and characters felt quite contrived and cliched. The subtitles were poorly highlighted and I often could not figure out who was speaking the line. The only refreshing thing in the movie was the final scene at the grandmother's funeral, but it was not worth a three hour wait to get to this poigant scene. Do yourself a favor, and skip this one."
1,Fox Lorber's DVD is not even worth buying,"Although Edward Yang's ""Yi-yi"" is a great film, Fox Lorber's DVD release is a disservice to the film. I had heard rumors that the DVD was substandard, but I so wanted to see the film again that I ordered it. Unfortunately everything I had heard was true. The transfer is blurry throughout, and on every near-horizontal surface there is distracting shimmering. It is so bad that you can even see foreground objects moving against the background, when they shouldn't, which is indicative of substandard encoding. AVOID THIS DVD AT ALL COSTS!"
4,Passion and Grief in Taiwan,"This film is so incredibly long that it needs more than one sitting. It's about powerful emotions slowly exploding from within each of these family members, in laws, old flame, new love interest, or business connection. I liked that the little boy and comatose grandma are never peripheral but rather essential characters."
1,Won't play!!,"This DVD set is marked as PAL format but will not play in my DVD player that is formatted to play PAL DVDs. It's not my machine as other PAL format DVDs play fine. I don't know what format this is in, but it's NOT PAL!! I am a big Corrs fan and was really looking forward to watching this. Disappointing!!"
1,Not Region 1,"I have received three copies of this DVD from Amazon and none of them were for Region 1. Be careful ordering this from Amazon. The description of the DVD indicates that it is Region 1 but it is not. If you live in Europe, Asia, or South America you'll be ok!"
1,Be Very Careful....Amazon did not send a Region 1 DVD,The DVD they sent was a European format. When I call customer service they just sent another copy of the same.
5,A Must Have For Any Fan,"As a long time fan of The Corrs I have all of their DVDs. This one goes beyond all of the others with the in-depth interviews, pictures, and narratives from the begin to the present.The concert section is most excellent with Andrea skipping all over the stage, Sharon and Caroline doing their song even sweeter than the last time, and Jim finely keeping it all together.Erin Go Bragh! Corrs Go Bragh!"
4,ACCESSORIES BOOK,GOT THE BOOK IN THE SHAPE OBSERVED AS DISPLAYED WITHOUT A DUSTCOVER WHICH WAS APPRECIATED. WAS A GOOD ORDER THANKS
4,Great value,"I like this goggle system. I used it all day for a woods ball game and took several shots in the head, and even some 'friendly' fire in the back of the head. Protected my head and face perfectly. Lens did fog up a bit, I'm gonna try some anti-fog spray. Still a great value!"
5,YOU MUST GET THIS HELMET!!!,"If you like protection and want to keep the looks too, then you must get this!! This thing is soo much better than JT's goggle and you have the option of wearing a helmet or a mask. I do agree with ""The Boose"" down below about the free shipping, but it is such a great mask to wait for. My friends say it looks like Master Chief from Halo, and who doesn't like Halo? So, stop sitting around, click the button and buy it. You won't regret it."
2,You get what you pay for.,"The price is what attracted me to this but unfortunately you get what you pay for. I found the mask to be, hot, quite uncomfortable (especially on the ears) and fog up pretty easily. Definitely not for people with larger heads and/or with glasses. I bought a V-Force Morph mask for $44 and though I don't have 360 protection I couldn't be happier. I can wear my sunglasses under it and hardly know I'm wearing a mask."
5,AWSOME.,I love paintball but hated getting hit on the back of the head. This helmet is great it protects without being unconfortable. The glass doesent fog up. I also have a big head and it fits great.
4,hit me with your best shot,It's a good helmet. Had a slight fogging problem but was an easy fix. Easy to put on and take off. Need some kind of cammo though.
3,Its good and BAd,"the mask isnt the best but is a good beginner mask, so if you want to play for fun and dont do it as a professsional sport.so all in all this mask isnt the best or the worst, and a good hint if you buy this mask dont wear the top and back of the mask to make sure that the lens doesnt fog up."
2,Good,We bought the helmet for our 12 year old son and it is a little big. We added some padding at the top and that fixed it.
3,OK...,"I have read several other books by this author and this book was just ok. I thought that it was very slow pased. I took a little to long to find out why he was there. Other than that I could handle the book, but it was force feed. But other than that the book was just ok for me. I know that everyone has their own points of view and reading preferences, but this was just my input to those as a forwarning."
5,Excellent work on history of Persia,"I am glad to have bought and read this book. It is quite informative and interesting to read. The pictures are excellent and the writing is plain. The book treats the origins and development of the Persian (Iranian) Empire before the coming of Islam. It celeberates the archeological efforts and historical research that have brought this important part of human's history and planet into light. I only wish that the title of the series was not Lost Civilizations but First Civilizations. Egypt, Persia and India are very much alive. These books can make very good gifts."
5,A concise History of Ancient Persia,"I wanted a succinct history of Ancient Persia, and this book delivered. Persians: Masters of Empire, a Time-Life Book in the Lost Civilizations series, covers information from 4000 BCE to the beginning of the Islamic period starting in 642 CE. In four neatly organized sections the book chronologically describes early civilizations, societal patterns, rulers, artistic innovations, foreign influences, architectural developments and much more. Maps and photographs of marvelous artifacts enhance the text.Time-Life produces great books in this genre, and Persians: Masters of Empire holds true to its publisher's fine reputation."
2,Poorly constructed lid diminishes what you think is a good buy.,"The wiring for the cage is weak, the perches are of plastic material and provides little support or stability. The cage is large and roomy for the price and it's a great buy if you're not interested in quality and are more interested in saving some money. My concern is that the lid is not in alignment with the cage. I also have some safety concerns due to the poor construction of the cage and will be sending the product back; time and money I really didn't want to spend. Hope this is of some service to anyone looking to purchase this cage."
4,Good for the price.,"A nice cage for the price, it is very roomy for my parakeet. He seems to be happy with his new home. It is easy to clean, light weight and will work fine. The only thing I wish I had known,is that all three doors were all on one end it would have been nice if there was one on the long side, that way you would not have to reach all across to the other end to put something in the cage.Shipped on 2/8 and received it on 2/10 great service."
2,Basic,Seems like a high school level text book - which is probably good if that is what you want. Not terribly indepth.
3,Nothing Very New,"This is a good, quick summation of things you may have read in self-help books, especially those dealing with cognative psychology. However, it contains nothing very surprising."
3,Not as good as the others,"I really have enjoyed his other books, but this is a little too zen for me."
5,Times have changed,"I remember buying this tape back in the early 90's and still to date it is one of the best ones out there. Unfourtunatley due to the record companies and political/legal aspect, Neurosis will never be able to perform any of these songs becuase they are not allowed to. I respect them for it cause let's face it the record industry is putting out the money that feeds their families(these guys aren't rich, so don't think of them as sell outs. Even though there newer releases rock and are very hard this one will always be my all time favorite. Especially ""the choice"" and ""double edged sword""."
1,Don't Buy Kohler!,"We bought the Alterna flume faucet 10 years ago and now it has a hair thin crack down the vertical interior shaft. Unbelievable! Had we known Kohler makes faucets that don't outlast your stay in your home, we never would have bought it. In addition, we had a hairline fracture in our Kohler toilet right after delivery and they refused to replace it. They said it could have happened while in our home!"
2,Devices are flaky,I have a couple of these; one works fine. Another in a different room (with a halogen bulb) keeps causing the light to flicker. I think it's the device itself - the LED flickers when the lights flicker. (And I thought Insteon was supposed to be better able to handle power line noise than X10? Apparently not so much.)
3,Glass v. Plastic,"I didn't realize these tumblers were plastic so you can imagine my surprise when I opened the box. I was going to return them, but after considerable thought opted not to. They will actually be perfect for outdoor entertaining. The colors are very vibrant and will brighten any table setting."
2,RQ-SW09V...What a dissapointment,I have had this model for almost 3 weeks now and I have gone through 2 AA batteries already! (It uses one at a time). I have used the cassette about 5 hours per battery! Not acceptable. The Sony I had previously rarely needed new batteries rarely and the controls were much easier labeled. The controls on this Panasonic are a horror!! I will be selling mine soon on Ebay and probably buying a Sony again! The sound quality is acceptable.
1,All past their expiration,"The peanut butter cups came in good condition. They were warm but intact. However, they all had expired in March. Sent them back for a refund with amazon. Would not recommend buying them."
4,Convert To Being A Nut.........At Least For Reeses......,"what's better than chocolate? Chocolate with peanut butter, of course!Reese's Peanut Butter Cups comes with two individually in a cut down variation of a muffin or cupcake wrap surrounds the candy pieces."
2,Not so great,"I was disappoined with the monitor ear buds. One fell apart on me. I invested in nicer ear buds for $100. However, when I first used the ear monitor system ""live"", it didn't even work. It did fine in rehearsal/soundchecks. But, it did not for performance. I am now investigating."
2,Known Gnome,It is cute...sat in my office for months...with lots of positive comments. Took outside...light worked sometimes. Paint coming off after 12 days outside...these gnomes now live back inside....without any solar glow!
3,CUTE LITTLE GUYS,"The box arrived, well packaged and on time. Gnome size was smaller than I had pictured in my head, but I suppose I should have read size and figured it out when I bought it. Cute as can be. I found a lovely spot in my woody backyard, where I've created a fairy garden and it's perfect for that. The light is dim, but I didn't expect it to glow like a regular lamp. It's not for that. I hung some solar lights in a tree over it and placed a mushroom behind it and it's lovely. I'm sure children will enjoy it too. I believe it's more expensive than it ought to be. Perhaps $25 at most."
3,False advertising,"I bought this for Merle's guitar playing and only three out of 50 songs display his virtuosity. He mostly just accompanies his singing. He has a nice voice but his singing style is boring. There is a wide range of his playing, solo, western swing (an adequate group but nowhere as interesting as Bob Wills)and other. I'd give it one star for the guitar playing but figure anyone interested in his evolution in the industry might like the set. There are many songs that I'd never heard before so they are of interest, historically. (Most I'd just as soon never hear again.) Personally I feel that I've wasted my money."
5,Gift for Mom!,"Bought this for my mom, and she love love loves it! Definitely takes her back a couple decades when she was singing this in church. Whatever makes my mom smile, deserves 10 stars!!!"
3,probably a better one out there,"i went back and forth on this radio with the sony. based on the reviews i got this one. the battery life is super long. i use this for camping and have had it on many hours. i've even left it on over night to still have going in the morning and am still on the 1st set of batteries. the only complaint i have is sometimes the reception will start to get staticy for no reason. i have dialed it in and after a few minutes or a an hour or whatever it will start to go out. sometimes it will hold for hours and sometimes i can't keep it locked on for more than a few minutes. not sure if this is because i'm in the woods when i use it or not. it's like that annoying radio that is in tune and as soon as you take your hand away, it goes out. frustrating. but like i said, not all the time and for 10 bucks, what the heck. you decide."
5,Excellent pocket radio,"This is an excellent radio to take out to the ballpark. It is an good size to hold grasp in the palm of my hand. The sound quality is good for its size. And, the radio is simple to use: one dial for to click on and adjust volume, and another dial to tune in your favorite station. Seems to work for many hours on one pair of AA batteries. I highly recommend!"
5,Excellent performance and value for the money,Radio performs better than you have any right to expect for 10 bucks. Good sound from the built in speaker and the tuning light helps to lock in your station. Solidly built too. You definitely won't regret it.
2,"works stationary, not walking","Cute little radio, and inexpensive. I can carry it with me and use it when I want to listen to my favorite radio station while waiting for my daughter at her after school activities, or during other stationary events. However, I was hoping to find something that would work during my long walks, and during my walks to the subway and in the subway. Unfortunately, this item does not regularly pick up the station I want, fades in and out, etc. if I'm in motion. Even stationary, it depends...."
5,it's a radio nothing more nothing less,Great product can produce a good amount of volume and picks up way more stations than any of the other radios I own.
4,good for it's size,I've had this radio for about 6 months and I really like it. Needs very little power to run so I use rechargeable batteries and they last a long time. It will stay tuned to the stations and the sound is excellent for a radio of this size. I bought it because I've had very good luck with all of the Panasonic products that I've owned over the years.
4,nothing but praise,"The radio recieves good reception when indoors. The battery life for this product was about average considering it only took 2 AA batteries to run.. The volume at high levels becomes distorted, but you have to keep in mind it only has one speaker, and is not meant to simulate a rock concert.. Overall it's a solid radio.."
2,Buy the Sony....,I bought two of these radios... they are IDENTICAL but one was made by Sony and one was made by Panasonic.... the Sony has MUCH better reception than the Panasonic but still not what I was hoping for.... Plenty of spots around where nothing could be reached on any frequency.
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this to listen to a local AM talk show. All I get is buzzing static. Iwish I had bought the Sony. A complete waste of money.
3,panasonic portable radio,"it is ok, but for your money, the sony for the same price is much better in how it pulls in the stations"
3,Small Radio,Needed a small radio to carry with me. Sound quality is tinny but overall not bad for the price and size.
4,mini radio,Have had this for a year or two now. It works fine. Believe I'll buy another for another location also.
5,Great unit,"Pocket radios are fairly hard to find nowadays, and this made the perfect gift for my mother. The tuning is great and the volume is outstanding for such a small unit."
3,How can you rate this with 5 stars?,"Sorry - I am a Radio collector and wonder how one can be fully satisfied with this one. AM reception is worst of all my recent purchase - Sony, Sharp, Kaito, Sangean - all are miles better. While FM is ok, AM is sub standard - and having a mono headphone jack (one ear reception) is not making it better. Recommended only of you are living in an area where your favorite stations are very strong. I give it 2.5*."
3,So-so little radio at great price,"I ordered this radio as as a backup for the Sony ICF-S10MK2 which I already own. I listen to the radio a lot, often news and sports and hate having ear buds in my ears 24-7.While I like the design of the Panasonic alot better, it's smaller and looks more modern, this radio does not have the reception that the Sony ICF-S10MK2 does. In fact, stations I get with ease on the other radio were difficult to find on this one. Also, the a.m. sound quality is very muffled. The little wheel that pulls in the stations is difficult to turn.If there weren't a better alternative, I imagine that this would be a good enough cheap little radio. If you are trying to decide between the two, go for the Sony."
1,Wish it worked right,It worked well for a month then the volume/on/off dial went bad. I started to bang it against a steel bar to get it to turn on. I give it praise to hold up well against the banging it has received.Been about 4 months since I got it and it still works but it is getting worse with the volume control and static.Too bad. It could of been a great radio.I ordered the Sony - hope it is better.
5,Emergency Kit essential,"The Panasonic RF-P50 is an absolute essential for our hurricane season emergency kit. Requiring only 2 AA batteries, it's economical to operate. Both AM & FM transmissions remain clear and audible. Use of the earplug does not dimenish clarity. Lightweight & pocket-sized, it's also a perfect addition for more fun pursuits: trips to the beach, picnics, softball & soccer games, etc. Buy two. You will not want to share."
3,Not stereo with headphones.,"Good little radio for the price. However, I'm disappointed using headphones. It is not stereo. You'll only hear out of one side of headset."
4,Compact and easy to use,Compact and useful. We use this in the car when we want to listen to sports and do not want to wear out car battery.
2,Poor Reception,"It seems difficult to buy a small inexpensive radio that gets good reception these days. I used to have a small Sony that lasted for years, but it's not available to buy anymore.I bought this model as its replacement and while the sound quality on FM is decent and clear, it is very hard to tune accurately. I live in a large city, yet I have to move the radio around to find a spot where the reception is acceptable. The tuning wheel is very sensitive which doesn't help the tuning ability."
1,was a christmas gift,"I would have loved to review this item,however it was NEVER sent. the site shows in stock. Beware of this vendor!!!!!"
2,Shoulda bought the Sony,"I bought both the Panasonic and the Sony to compare. Well there is no comparison.The Sony is by far the better radio. The Sony held stations clearly that the Panasonic couldn't even grab at all.Don't fool around with this radio, buy the Sony."
3,Little Gem it is,"The RFP50-As the orther rewier has said.. it is little gem. Gem is perhaps the correct word to describe the radio.Wel built and nice looking and evoking the past pocket radios, nice little sound.But when it comes to AM reception little muffled. As I have said elsewehere Sony' MK2 is better in the AM department. I have since 2004 July and I love the radio-I don't know why-you too will just love it-it is more emotional than loigcal-like the love you havge for beetles and minis.The finish is much better than the its competitor, the panasonic guys have paid more attention to little details, like the batt compartment and the Production details moulded at the back.The best thing I love about the radio is the little ear piece that comes with it-the connical one that stuff into your ear-not the stereo ones-cute and reminding the olde types.But the antenna is as filmsy as the Sony's. Feel very fragile but ok.Good in FM tuning but bit weak in AM.But then we buy radio to tune in stations..."
5,The Best Radio Ever Got!!!! Must Have!!,"I have own so many kinds of pocket radio, this is going to be the last kind I will ever own.1. Excellent reception, it dosen't matter if it is inside my no radio work truck that I am driving or inside a four story building, there is still reception for AM.2. 6 hours a day, 5 days a week, 8 days now, 2 Kirland's AA batteries are still runing. Amazing!!If you are looking for a reliable radio, you have to get this one, THE ONLY ONE you ever need to look for."
4,Radio,"Battery life is awsome, signal is great, quality of product is fine. Great for the price. do recomend for any sport fans who listen to sports over the radio and daily for the daily working man."
4,Panasonic Radio,"We are one of few people who still use transistor radios. We have ordered several of these Panasonic radios and find them to be among the best of all brands. They arrive earlier than promised and have proven to be much better in quality than other brands we have purchased. They don't have a overly long life span, but longer than other brands and they are used a lot. We are very appreciative of this product. It is as described and arrives earlier than anticipated and in great condition. Thank you."
1,Don't buy this radio,I bought this radio for my elderly mother who is used to this type of radio and doesn't want to have anything to do with earphones. The volume control on this radio is bizarre. You can either get it so you can't hear anything or it blasts you out of your chair. She can't use it and I can't find anything like it in the stores. It was a waste of money.
2,sound on only one earbud,I was looking for a radio that's good on batteries that I can listen to while going to sleep.This one misses that boat because the sound only comes from one earbud. not acceptable.
3,Beware of Price Increase,"This is a cheap pocket radio so don't expect the world here. As other reviewers have pointed out, the AM reception is poor to fair at best. FM is good. Sound is decent. I guess it was worth the 10 bucks. However the price has just doubled! With that in mind I suspect there are now better options."
5,panasonic radio,"yes, i purchased this radio because i liked the looks of it and wanted to add it to my collection."
5,If you are a supertramp fan this is a MUST!,"Roger Hodgson is SUPERB! Buy this cd 'cause you're gonna love it. I assure you! All tracks are great! ..For me it's the continuation of Supertramp's Famous Last Words. Listen to Had a Dream, In Jeopardy,Lovers in the wind, Give me Love.. and Only because of you and you will completely satisfied. I wish one day Roger & the boys get together to produce another Supertramp album. Hodgson is Supertramp & Supertramp is Hodgson!"
3,LIKE SUPERTRAMP WITHOUT THE SUPER,"Supertramp's Roger Hodgson's first solo album from 1984 is, like the worst of Supertramp, big and bland, and overloaded with the vague empty imagery of prog rock, where the object of desire; an unidentified god, self, or lover, is expressed in the worst of amateur poetry cliches - ""Time is always on the run, we've only just begun, lovers in the wind."" It's line after line of this Kansas meets Karen Carpenter blandness, but Hodgson's whiny, happy lunatic vocals recall Supertramp's most infectious songs, and sometimes this mirrored canary in a cage sings a sweet, if mindless tune, as in the final track, ""Only Because of You"", a thunderhead of nothing sentiment, but a gloomy prog rock haunt that should get you comfortably staring into the void, provided you ask nothing of your empty space. It's a rainy day Supertramp album in dire need of the group's production values."
5,In The Eye Of The Storm,Great music from a great musician!!! With the help of one of the biggest record labels Roger Hodgson created another masterpiece. If you are a fan of Supertramps works up to this solo release then you will really enjoy this release from 1984.
5,Like a dream!,"This album is absolutely fantastic! It's like a dream! I'm a fun of Supertramp, specially of Rodger Hodgson."
4,"Solid 1st Solo Effort From ""Mr. Supertramp""!!!","Solid songwriting & playing from Mr. Hodgson! The song, In the Eye of Storm (Sleeping with the Enemy) was a catchy rock radio staple when it came out! The album has a definite Supertramp feel, and boasts Hodgson's best work since leaving the band. Not a terrible song in the lot, but the album might have been improved with a few other voices, musicians & writers.Much like Roger Waters of Pink Floyd, he was the major creative force within the band, but eventually was unable to work with his bandmates. Like Waters, his creative output following his departure became both infrequent and inconsistent compared to his work within the band."
5,RH,"I owned the vinyl album in the mid eighties. As a long time Tramp fan, this release was an awesome change from some of the group's later work. While I always considered Davies and Hodgson one of the great rock tandems of all time, this solo release showed just how tremendously talented Roger is."
5,AWESOME BOOK,"Abuela's Weave is a very good, accurate book about how the Maya people actually live. I've travelled often to Guatemala and visited many villages. The pictures in Abuela's Weave depict life as it really is in the villages... the Mayan dress, the houses, work, animals. Very good. I read this book often to my 4 year old granddaughter and use the opportunity to educate her on Guatemalan culture and to teach her some Spanish. My cousin, Dominga Sic Ruiz, was born in Guatemala and adopted in the USA. We sell weavings made by the women of a village in Guatemala. The weavings go great with the book...hand in hand...to buy a weaving write to domingasic@hotmail.com Thanks. Mary P."
4,Excellent for what it is.,"Its not the best tripod out there. Fully opened its not very tall, however closed it is small. I bought this tripod to bring to Disney World so I could take long night exposures of the fireworks displays and other night shots and to take long exposures of the many many waterfalls at Animal Kingdom. It served it purpose well. It fit perfectly in my backpack (its less than 14"" tall when folded up) and is very light. I'd like it better if it had a tilt head, but you can get around that by tilting the camera towards the ground then turning the camera sideways.I wouldn't use this tripod with a long heavy lens, but with a wide angle or standard zoom lens it is fine.I'll probably keep this in my car as an extra tripod in case I forget my regular one. I usually have my camera with me and you never know when those great picture opportunities will arise."
4,Nice and sturdy,Great compact design. Fits in my low pro passport sling along with my canon T3i and 70-300 zoom lens. I wish it was a little taller... It's kind of short when fully extended. But all in all I think this will work out great for my trip to the UK ths summer.
1,It broke after 2 months,The clips on the leg extensions are made of cheep plastic that bands and now doesn't hold the leg up.
1,Not worth the money.,"I saw this in the store, and I just had to have it. Firstly, I love the Smiths, and secondly, I absolutely obsess over Cursive. I saw that they had done a cover of ""Frankly, Mr.Shankly"" and I bought it right away. I went home to listen to it, and I was disappointed. The Cursive song was great, as expected, but all of the other songs fell short.If you're considering buying this, don't. Just download the Cursive cover and don't waste your time on the rest."
1,Absolutely Horrible!!!,"First of all I cannot stress enough how much The Beautiful Mistake butchered ""Cemetary Gates"" It makes my stomach turn. Every single song is butchered. To the point that it's disrespectful. ""Frankly Mr. Shankly"" ""Panic"" ""There's a light..."" such beautiful songs to just have some horrible band cover it. Every band on this cd shouldn't be allowed to record again. Cursive, Beautiful Mistake etc. should be fined for this."
1,How Soon Can I Get Rid of This CD?,"I purchased this CD too quickly; I thought it was a best of the Smiths compilation. So it arrives and I see that is a modern compilation from other bands. I think, okay, how bad can it be. Buyers, it can be very, very bad. If this is the impact that The Smiths has had on music then maybe Morrissey should have have been an electrician. I can say good things about three bands on the CD. Hundred Reasons, Walter Walter and The Beautiful Mistake succeed only because they stay somewhat true to the original. The other bands try so hard to sound hurt and damaged that they completely miss the beauty that is The Smiths. I just hope that I can sell it to a used CD store for a dollar."
1,Bad. Very Bad.,"I've only listened to ""There is a light that never goes out"", and it is one of the most horribly arranged and dreadfully executed covers I've ever heard. This band, ""My Awesome Compilation"" completely butchered a wonderful song by calling it a ""tribute?"" ... I'd suggest getting Seven Worlds Collide if you want to hear someone other than Morrissey do justice to this song."
2,Doesn't quite work,"In voice-activated mode, records a noisy beep every 2 seconds, thus almost completely obscuring the recording. This is with new Panasonic batteries. Problem only appears in voice-activated mode."
3,"Should have been marked as ""fair"", not ""good"".","The book itself is in good structural condition, but almost every page had portions highlighted by the original owner. Shipping, though, was fast and painless. Overall the seller was good at emailing when the package shipped and the price was fair... only the description needed a bit more detail."
4,Perfect for travel and office too.,"I have had this carry-on for months now, and I am pleased to report that it performs like a champ for me. It is possible to get it under a plane seat (sideways), and the two wheels make going through the airport easy enough. There is enough space for 5-6 inches of printed paper, plus my tablet computer, accessories and more. I had been lugging my computer with a Targus shoulder strap case, and I really like the ease of pulling versus carrying. There is even space enough for two computers (when my wife asks me to carry hers too.) I like this enough that I use it every day to get my personal computer to and from work. There is one spot where the zipper for the main compartment kind of catches, but that is not a problem yet. The handle seems stong enough in the airport. It has not really given me trouble, although I do treat it nicely."
2,Broken Handle,My handle has broken in 2 ways- The screws came completely out and i had to replace them with longer ones and glue. AND my handle won't fully retract out of its frame and so the handle is not long enough to pull behind you.Otherwise I like the bag- its size and the quietness of the wheels but i wish it was more durable.
1,Poor manufacturing quality,"This bag has two (2) major flaws.(1) The wheel base is made of molded plastic which is riveted on the the sides. When I received my bag the plastic casing around the left and right side rivet holes were clearly cracked. This appears to be a design flaw and the actual cracking most likely occurred during manufacture when the rivets were punched. Because this is a definite weak point in the bag, even if it had not been damaged during manufacture it would most likely crack during normal use.(2) There is not enough padding for the computer compartment...especially between the handle and computer compartment. Therefore, if the bag is dropped or subjected to a moderate jolt your computer could suffer damage that would not occur in a better manufactured bag. Bottom line...spend a few extra bucks and get a bag that will protect your computer and last more than a few trips."
5,Grant's Greatest,"Another ""cool jazz"" classic by the talented Mr. Green. This was Grant's best effort from his traditional jazz years which ran thru the mid 60's, before he started to experiment with soul, funk, and bebop later in his career. Standouts from the album include ""My Favorite Things"" & ""Bedouin"".Grant was probably the most under-appreciated jazz artist to ever record an album. Since his untimely death at the age of 43, he has slowly begun to attract the critical accaim he deserved. The evolution of ""acid jazz"" in the 90's, also lead a resurgence of younger fans as Grant's music was very popular in the genre."
3,joe meek tales of a mountain man,"this is a very entertaining account of a well known mountain man who lived in the fur trade era. However, if you have read several other books on this subject, a lot of it will be familiar because the stories and dialogue are often quoted in other works; he has a lot of famous and oft quoted tall tales. Still, a worth while readand very well written."
4,Really Excellent,"This is a fun and useful book that will make you feel good and challenge to you step outside the box. It's dense and will require engagement of its recommended exercises over time.If you are in sales, don't get this as I want this advantage ONLY for ME."
1,Worst book I've ever read...,"As you've maybe read others reviews, you've already understood that this book is not about technique but it's more of poorly written seminar's transcript so If you're looking for some technique or hints you will NOT find it there. Because as a professional seller and sales trainer, I've read many many books on the topic but this one was clearly the most useless and boring one. One of my friend told me that Bandler said he could write a book in a single month, read that and you'll understand why !I'd also like to point out that NLP works great BUT you absolutely need a lot of elegance to make it work, poor NLP gets poor results, were you really expecting to be able to be a race car champion just because you can drive a car ?So forget about this book and look for books of people who can write, think about others while making a book and also who have taken time to explain things in a crystal clear way."
1,A lot of poorly written hype rather than useful methods,"I thought that this would take basic information about NLP techniques and make them more useful for sales situations. Instead it's full of inflated puffery from the authors (via their vanity press).Even worse is the tacky, manipulative approach they take to what ought to enhance the relationship that sells. Wish I had read the NEGATIVE reviews below more carefully before buying. Keep your receipt!"
5,Teaching on many levels,Richard Bandler is my favorite teacher of all time. He tells stories teaching in metaphor making learning easy and fun.
2,The king is wearing no clothes!,"The Bandler groupies may well 'give it five stars', but at the end of the day few people will get much out of it, it's a badly communicated ranting. There are other NLP books, try NLP the new technology of achievement and Be the person you want to be."
2,Motivational at best,"In terms of techniques you don't get very much out of it. Bandlers style became inceasingly rambling -- he'll call it hypnotic... and that's not for people with the goal to really learn and understand something. Fortunately, there's a small book from Michael Hall out there where he clarifies what Bandler does in PE, otherwise you'd be lost (title: Persuasion Engineering Simplified). I also wouldn't recommend trying this on customers. The process is simply too strange for normal people. In a therapeutic context it *may* work. However, there are better books on NLP in a sales context. Try Beyond Selling from Bagley & Reese instead, or PoP from Kevon Hogan."
1,Poorly Written & Organized,"I had read numerous articles about neurolinguistics and heard about Bandler and La Valle. I was excited about reading this book and wanted to use it in the sales training classes I teach. However, I was absolutely shocked when I started reading this book. It seemed to me to be a collection of B.S. stories. The author jumped around from subject to subject and B.S. story to B.S. story. The style of writing is very poor and hard to follow. Take my word for it; this is one of the worst books on persuasion you'll ever encounter."
2,A strange book,"This is a very strange book. There are some helpful thoughts, if you can get past the bizzare sentence structure (supposedly part of NLP), and frequent digressions. There are two authors, although it is written in the first person? Be prepared for a bizzare world view, obsessed with money and sex."
2,Spoken Lebanese,Dr. Feghali's book is definitely not for one who knows nothing about the language. The lessons are poorly structured--they include dialogue in Lebanese with no translation and words that had not been taught in any previous lessons. I found the book difficult and frustrating. I know some Lebanese and I could not handle the book. I am also a teacher and I would never recommend this book as a teaching instrument.
4,Excellent book,"I used this in a UCLA class and found it very useful. The bad thing is that there is no alphabetical index of words, but if you learn everything in this book you will be able to speak a lot of Levantine arabic! It is all transliterated, there is no Arabic writing. The tape is also very helpful though they speak a bit too fast. I would still highly recommend it."
2,Not helpful without a teacher,"First of all consider that the book comes without any tape or CD (and that is probably my mistake not having noticed that while ordering it).I therefore found myself trying to learn a difficult language such as arabic (lebanese dialect) with only a book consisted in great part of dialogs not explained in english...If you therefore wish to learn lebanese with such a book, get a teacher first, otherwise opt for ""Arabic you need""..."
3,Spoken Lebanese,"The author does a good job on basics of the language. A glaring omission is the absence of a cross-reference from English to Lebanese and the reverse. This should have been included with a vocabulary size of 10,000 words."
3,"Good, but limited","This book is a good way to start speaking Lebanese quickly, which is what the author intended (although to achieve any degree of fluency, a person would need to practice with someone who speaks Lebanese Arabic). It contains lots of very common, useful vocabulary, and outlines grammatical structure without overwhelming the reader. Its lessons and vocabulary are divided thematically in a way that would be useful to someone travelling in Lebanon. As someone who has studied Modern Standard Arabic, I would have liked to have seen the Arabic script as well as the transliteration, since I find transliteration confusing. Some reviewers referenced a tape, but when I purchased this book there was no tape with it...maybe that was discontinued? An audio supplement would be critical for anyone who is not already familiar with Arabic.Overall, it's a good start to speaking Lebanese Arabic and would be valuable to anyone visiting Lebanon."
5,Sherlock Holmes,I purchased volume 2 and REALLY have enjoyed it. I have viewed 2 of the 4 films so far. The restoration by UCLA is outstanding. You must be a Sherlock Holmes/Basil Rathbone to really enjoy this series. Highly recommended. Amazon has been great and free shipping does not hurt either.
5,A EXCELLENT RESTORATION OF SHERLOCK HOLMES,"I""m a man of few words. If you enjoy Sherlock Holmes, As I do .Dont Hesitate to buy these wonderful restored versions of the great Holmes Classics, I had purchased a previous version by a company called Focus Film....No Comparision to these wonderfulMPI Volumes. The Picture and Sound Is fresh and Crisp, As though they were made Yesterday, Rather then 60 Years ago. Buy them , Settle back in your easy chair , And watch Holmes and WatsonDeduce the Culprits, I promise you will be In for a wonderful Evening.........."
5,Green Hazard,This book is important to me as it was the first Manning Coles novel I read which introduced me to the world of Tommy Hambledon.This story takes place in NAZI Germany where our hero is duping the Germans with a new explosive. Hambledon had previously been a high official in the Berlin police department but escaped prior to WWII breaking out. That is elucidiated in A DRINK TO YESTERDAY (and that book is followed by A TOAST TO TOMMORROW) which explains how a British secret agent in WWI finds himself to be an amnesiac German sailor who eventually joins NAZI party and becomes a senior poilice official.
5,This has been a favorite of mine for 50 years,"Manning Coles ( pair of authors) has their secret agent kidnapped to Nazi Germany (by an error on the German's part) where he becomes helpful in minor sabotage before escaping back to England.This is a paperback version, but it is identical to the hardcover version. I was missing the last page of the hardcover copy, and the last page is identical, word for word."
5,Amazing,"Once in a while you encounter someone who is truly ahead of his time, on in this case, probably just in time, since an understanding of his work can be, and will be, life-changing and even life-saving for many of us. He comes across as completely genuine, intelligent, thoughtful and best of all, enthusiastic about his work. Listen to this, over and over if you have the time. It's lengthy, but worth it. I haven't yet read his books, but I think you need to listen to him to really feel his passion for science. It took me a few listenings to complete digest everything he was saying. This is mind-blowing, cutting edge thinking. His work, and that of others epigeneticists, brings to mind the work of other forward thinkers, e.g., Copernicus, Martin Luther, etc., who caused dramatic shifts in our world view. Excellent product."
4,The Wisdom of Your cells,"Very easy to listen to. Rather deep in some areas but very interesting and informative. I don't agree with his belief in discrediting God and that our source of wisdom comes from our environment. The Spirit of God lives in me and helps me in becoming who I am. I do believe environment has a much greater impact on us than it has been given credit for, especially in relation to thoughts, fears and peace of mind. I really appreciate the new understanding of science Bruce has to bring in understanding the cells! Much easier to listen than to read, for me."
2,The Control Mechanism is What?,"Lipton's initial presentation of a string of fun discoveries from the history of science is suddenly interrupted by a clunker of a punch line.Lipton lost me when he stated on disc #2 that the control mechanism for cellular membranes is obviously field broadcasts from the eternal beings of the spirit world.I know he is mistaken here because the results of my own laboratory experiments clearly show that the control mechanism for cellular membranes is either 1) God, 2) The Flying Spaghetti Monster, 3) Aliens or 4) Pokemon.I will read more of Lipton's work when he finds a way to scientifically test his hypothesis. Perhaps then he can disprove mine."
4,"Positive Thinking Can Be a Matter of Life or Death, cellularly speaking","Dr.Bruce Lipton pulls back the curtain of our physical being and provides profound insights into the connection that many people have spoken to over time: ""Whether you think you can or you can't, you are right."" Henry Ford. Be very careful what thoughts you entertain because your body has the ability to listen VERY closely and respond according to your beliefs. The meaning I attach to any situation makes ALL the difference in terms of the outcome. Dr. Lipton's ability to make the profound simple is unmatched, he is a teacher who has the GIFT and ABILITY to make complex information very simply and easy to understand and apply immediately in life.Author/Speaker Lauren Miller: Hearing His Whisperwww.laurenemiller.com"
3,"Started fascinating, became tedious, and finally silly","I listened to each of the eight CD's and by the time it finally ended today, I was talking back to the CD and not in a good way. It got to be laughable. At the beginning, I was completely fascinated as Dr. Lipton explained biology in a way I'd never heard or imagined, but sadly, he eventaully meandered off into a strange connection between dinosuars and corporations as killing machines and birds representing flights to the moon and the meek inheriting the earth or something. I'm not really sure."
5,Do not order the Audio Download.,"These are a fantastic series of lectures as others have elaborated on. However the audio download from Audible.com does not offer any Table of Contents for the numerous sections. It is a single 8 hour track with only an indication of what Chapter you are in. No Chapter names, no section names. This is pretty useless for the reader who wants to know what subject is being handled and how to return to that subject later on. They were kind enough to refund my money when I complained about this and I ordered the actual CD's afterwards."
4,A necessary addition to your screenwriting resources,"I've read other screenwriting books, but keep picking this up to keep me motivated and on track. This book does not have the nuts and bolts of the beginning ""how to's"". It's not meant to. It's the book you pick up after the others to change your attitude.I recommend it."
1,So what,I was rather unimpressed. My advise (after reading a couple of books like this) watch movies. Think. And write. And write. And write.
3,It is okay,"It does hold the chalk very securely, but the main problem is that when you need to push the chalk out again to be able to write so more you can't unless you have something to shove into the opposite end of the chalk holder. It grips the chalk and won't let go. It will not release no matter how much you shake or bang it."
3,Nice,the chalk hold is is great quality and light but the textured finish at the end of the holder can hurt after a while of writing with it. Advancing and storing the chalk does require a little more than just pressing a button.
1,"No Promises, No Debts, No Reason to Bother with this album","I'm more than a little dumbfounded at the positive reviews for Golden Earring's ""No Promises, No Debts."" This album is complete rubbish from start to finish and ranks as just another bad Golden Earring album (and this group has had its share over the years). Lyrically, Golden Earring hits its low point with such crass tunes as ""Snot Love in Spain"" and ""Tiger Bay."" This album sounds like there was little to no effort involved in even trying to produce a quality product. Completely forgettable - musically, it's listenable for maybe one listen. To their credit, Golden Earring is always trying to expand its sound, but they still have difficulty producing quality songs."
1,solid,"An avid ge fan will enjoy this cd. As other reviewers noted D-light is highly underrated as it rocks with typical goldenearring intensity. The lyrics are generally right on and both singers are pretty damm good . The variety of songs is quite interesting . Goldenearring was a progresive band so dont expect to hear the son of radar love on this cd , it takes a couple of listens to get the feel of the cd buts its worth it. The most underrated band in rock history who is still alive and well today , 2006."
3,"Not really bad, Not really good","I like Golden Earring a lot but this album seemed rushed a little. This album was their final release for Polygram. I do however think that if you are a fan you will like this album. The tracks that rock are ""Weekend Love"", ""Heartbeat"" and ""Snot Love In Spain"". I'm glad they released this on CD finally because it was near impossible to get a hold of it previously. I don't think that this album will be remembered as a great album by Golden Earring but it will rank above their release ""Keeper Of The Flame"" which was very disappointing."
3,No promises here.,"Golden Earring ""No Promises... No Debts"" DNC (1979).Back from the hard rockin' ""Grab"", GE goes for more of pop-rock sound. Nothing really stands out, but a few good numbers in, ""Weekend Love"", ""Heart Beat"" and Don't Stop the Show""."
2,Golden Earring :No Promises...No Debts,"Small touches of brillance light the way for things to come.It's 1979 B.C.(Before CUT)and now you can see where this band was heading.Track #5 SAVE YOUR SKIN is really the track of note on this release but I would be hard pressed to say it saved this cd's skin.A release for only the audiophiles out there.As a footnote however are Tracks #8 WEEKEND LOVE & #10 DON""T STOP THE SHOW;these early renditions prove the bands raw power as eighteen years later you can hear these same tunes rock your world on ""The Complete Naked Truth"" (double cd 1997)"
3,"Great picture, but........","The picture is great (and that's my first criterion for a television) and the 2-tuner PIP is easy to use. My only complaint about this model is the A/V inputs. There are only two and they are both on the back of the set. With a DVD, VCR and a camcorder, I come up short! It seems like once a week I'm having to push the entertainment center away from the wall to mess with the cables!"
4,"Nothing exciting, but a solid product nonetheless","No, this is not a sexy product. It's not a flat-screen , it doesn't have component inputs, it doesn't have front AV inputs, it only has one S-video input, it doesn't have a 3D comb-filter or an invar shadow mask. But why dwell on what it doesn't have, when it delivers such a great picture and suberb sound for under $1000?If picture for price is your bottom line, this JVC model is the best in this price category."
5,Blockbuster,"Wow talk about a couple of stars.See this movie.(Some day I'm gunna meet Ms. Stowe).Seriously, its a good movie, with great actors."
1,Wrong Format / Zone,"The incorrect zone format was sent to me. It was for a PAL system.Rather than go through the hassle of trying to return it, I gave it to our Spanish exchange student. He'll be able to watch it when he gets back to Spain."
3,"Modestly entertaining episodes, but not the best the series has to offer","A perfectly watchable batch of episodes, but I found myself moving through this set at a much slower pace than previous sets. There just wasn't as much of a ""got to see what happens next"" quality to these episodes. It also didn't help that the ""Barnabas being forced to create a mate for Adam"" storyline is silly, illogical, and- even by this show's standards- completely unbelievable. I'll still buy the next set, as we still have Quentin Collins and- if longtime fans are to be believed- one or two other classic Dark Shadows characters and storylines on the horizon, but I just might take a break and backtrack to those now-available earliest episodes of the series before proceeding onto set 10."
4,Dark Shadows Series,"Part 9 of the collection of Dark Shadows, received in good condition and in good speed as well. One day I will get all of these silly things... LOL."
2,Mobley and the Watermelon Man,"notice the song ""A Caddy for Daddy"" (1965) is a blatant copy of Herbie Hancock's ""Watermelon Man"" from 1962. It's even in the same key and tempo! Mobley and/or the label were trying for a herbie sized hit."
3,Not bad,The author writes from the level of his initiation with love and respect for the Religion. Dont expect any depth or fireworks (if you want that read Wande Abimbola) if you just want an introduction to Santeria read and enjoy.
5,A good introductory descritpion of Santeria in New York,"Dr. Murphy writes a good story. The book is a description of his personal experience in Santeria. It should be noted that he is not an initiate, but he writes in a sympathetic, informed and respectful way about the religion. Even though he is an academic, this book is written in a non-academic style. If you are curious about santeria it is a must read."
4,"Not Bad, Not Great Either","I am somewhat indifferent to this book. I bought it a couple of years ago and have read it a few times. It is divided into three parts and parts one and three read like a college text book giving way to much dry information which is fine if your doing a research paper. The second part however is much more interesting giving a very vivid description of a botanica, elekes, warriors, and more. I would suggest buying this book for reference but also taking it with a grain of salt, dont believe everything you read."
1,pass it up,this book is another one not worth buying. It is funny that non intiates like to write books about a religion they do not have a firm grasp of knowledge of.
4,Great job!,Product shipped on time. They fit without a problem and now our tiller is back up and working. I am a happy customer. Thank you.
4,5pc Quick-Connect Kit,"Can't beat this kit for the price... And free shipping! Just apply teflon tape to threads, and attach your fittings. These work like they're supposed to..."
2,False Photo,"It seems misleading product images are becoming more common on Amazon. I've tried in the past to correct these, but Amazon sheds responsibility for what they advertise.The main coupling in this package is not rustproof brass, as in the photo. It appears to be the same mystery metal as the four fittings, since it's not specified in the Amazon listing, or even on the physical package. I fully expect this to rust out, so be prepared to buy it again and again."
3,Perfect seal,"I've had these for a while and like every other quick conn kit I've ever tried, eventually the female connectors leak after a half year or so. Just as good as the competition then, I suppose, and the price is right."
4,A Pretty Good Album,"If I have to say anything about this album, I like George Michael 's voice a lot. He has one of the most beautiful singing voices I've ever heard. Although this album may be short, I like it a lot. The songs You've Changed, The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, and Secret Love are really recommended. I Remember You and Miss Sarajevo are quite nice but Miss Sarajevo may possibly bore some people. I also like Brother, Can You Spare Me a Dime, very emotional though I think a bit heavy. Otherwise the rest are okay though I didn't like the album's version of Roxanne as it was too soft and it lacks some of the emotion from the original. Otherwise, get this album whether you look for nostalgia or more George Michael."
3,Needs Work,"Although I like George, I wouldn't exactly call myself a fan. Within the first 2 minutes of listenting to this CD I thought, ""Wow, what a voice!"" I really liked the arrangement for ""Brother Can You Spare a Dime."" Other than that, the selections on this album make me think that George may have been experimenting - trying to stretch some artistic muscles. I give him an A- for effort, but the album as a whole is a little too sentimental - there is no ""relief""."
1,George Michael in a sleepy mood,"I love George Michael's songs, but when I obtained his latest album, ""Songs from the Last Century"", I was very disappointed. He sounded so lethargic and sleepy! It's even too mellow for a lounge music ... His version of The Police's ""Roxanne"" is different but pleasant, but the rest of the songs are, sorry to say, rather pathetic. Cheer up, George! The last century wasn't that gloomy and this is NOT the way to start the new millenium!"
2,"George, I love ya but....","I sit and wait for ANY new George Michael album to hit the stores... I Love this man's voice and his talent is unquestionable. I honestly can say that I idolize George and I consider myself one of his biggest fans...but this album really stinks. There are a few songs that I really liked and I'm glad to have THEM in my collection. Roxanne is done so well (that is to say that GM's version is actually good) and I really loved Where or When, but aside from a few others... this was a VERY DREARY experience. Please, George, when you hit the studio next time... make it an album that YOU did. This century had so much material that would be better suited for your voice... including YOUR stuff! We miss you George, and we really miss your pop music (after listening to this album)come back and hit No.1!"
5,The Man Can Do It All,"To no surprise he has done it aegaen! but I think he could have put in one other jazzy song,""KISSING A FOOL""to the album songs... He has the best voice(male or female)I have ever heard Jazz,Pop,and dance. The man can do it all."
4,Another winner for an under-appreciated artist!,"Building on the direction he took on ""OLDER"" he continues to mature as a fantastic singer on this disc of covers. Certainly a varied selection of songs, yet the arrangements hold the whole album together. (I love his version of 'Roxanne'.)"
2,Songs to help you sleep,"A lot of pure sap poured into this CD. Granted, I enjoy several of them (good late night listening when you want to unwind) but some of these really push the envelope of corny (""The first time ever I saw your face"", for instance. My goodness, I could feel myself lapse into a coma...)In another song, ""You've changed"", if you listen close to the line, ""You've forgotten the words.... I love you"", at that break before ""I love you"", I would swear you can hear George Michael stifle a yawn. This entire CD is a stifled yawn.Thumbs down the review if you must... but you know I'm right."
5,The best of his career,"I hear this CD as his best work to date as I can tell that he recorded this doing exactly the way HE wanted to. The passion is strong through each song and the re-inventions are worthy of the work.I also want to tell George (since I believe he will read this someday) ""I get it"". Which I doubt more than 1% of the world did. It clicked after a few plays.For people that liked this or other George Michael work, I highly reccomend the new CD ""Revival"" by Sam Harris. As well as his ""Standard Time"".Thanks George. It's absolutely wonderful!"
2,Tame and bland. A disappointment - sadly.,"What happened?Most of these songs have already been sublimely interpreted by fantastic artists. To choose to cover them, you'd have to have something pretty unique to add.George Michael has proven himself to be a terrific song-writer on several levels. Why he chooses to release an album that seems to be bred by such low aspirations and no real desire to expand on earlier and far superior interpretations is a real mystery to me.The bland, easy-listening production of every single song does not help.Bottom line: this album sounds uninspired, uninventive, unambitious. It's okay, but okay is not enough. Not by a long stretch. George Michael is so much better than this.Even if you are a huge fan, and personally I am one, you could probably do without this album."
1,this is where i draw the line...,"I have been a huge george michael fan practically all my life, and been through his many phases from wham to faith and back around to older, but i cannot in good conscience say that i even care for this album. and it hurts me to say that. i was looking forward to his new release so much..."
3,Nice vocals...,"This is not George Michael's best album. If you are not a George Michael fan you may not have ever listened closely to his lyrics. Believe it or not the lyrics on his three original solo albums are full of depth and beauty. This album is just covers of some of his favorite songs. Perhaps because of my age (late twenties) a lot of these songs are completely foreign to me. If you're new to George Michael and want to hear some great music I recommend Older and ""Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1"" as two great albums where George is at his best."
3,"Speed it up a bit, George!","I am a big fan of GM, despite his low artistic output and I bought this album without a second thought.Although I like it, it is because of that voice rather than the tunes. George's interpretations are just to turgid and depressing and there aren't enough light moments on the CD. If he could just have speeded up a couple of the versions...Music to be depressed to, but not an album for the impatient."
2,Why These Songs?,"With loads and loads of songs to choose from over the last 100 years, I find myself scratching my head as to why George would choose this collection?There's no doubt that George's voice is one of the best there is, but an album of eight long, soupy ballads is not the way to excite people about a new CD.The only tracks off the album I had heard (or heard of) before were ""Roxanne"" and ""First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"". Neither would have been near the Top 1000 songs from the last century I would have chosen.The other songs come from even earlier times. Of all of those, ""Brother, Can You Spare A Dime?"" has some spark and ""Secret Love"" is a welcome breath of big band during a long, slow, plod towards the 10th track.I am a huge George fan, but I am truly disappointed by this album. George can do (and has done) much better. The voice is still great. However, the same can't be said for the choices for this album's material."
2,It is Very Different Then Anything Else from G.M.,I like listening to George Michael as I personally feel he has a great voice but this album is not really for me. I like almost all of his music but I could have skipped this one and it would not have been a loss.
5,For the truly music LOVERS!,"To describe this album as 'divined' will be an understatement. Geogre has made yet another wonderful acheivement in music, by making it!As you see by the other reviews on this site, the ones who should appricate this, do ( i.e truly music LOVERS, any LOVERS, and (true) fans :) ).Whoever is lucky enough to own it, knows that the valubale of this beauty just grows bigger and bigger with every darn listening... from the suprisingly amazing ""Brother.."" to that ending inst. track, you sence George's love & talent in each note... and whoever is well-informed enough, able to read what he says on his life, love and anything between, *between* the lines ;o). [although he didn't write it, of course!]YEA, at least for me, he has succeeded to acheive his goal(which is NOT to declare something on the music of the 20th century by his choices, BUT--) to interpert his favorites from that century, in the best way he could.Thanks Yoggie, for that gift! :))"
1,Lyrics not as printed,I purchased this CD because I did a search for specific lyrics I wanted to hear. These lyrics were listed as being part of the CD. I purcahsed the CD for that reason only and the introductory lyrics were not part of the music. I was very disappointed.
3,Dig It,"I too am a huge, colossal GM fan. I flew over to London for the weekend once just to see his MTV Unplugged performance--which they were planning to make into a cd and never did which is a huge loss. And Older was a bit dissappointing so what I reccommend if you are feeling iffy about this CD -- download all the songs at his official aegean site. That's how I found out it was out in the first place. I listened to them all last week. Very cool. I love the net!"
5,FANTASTIC!,"George Michael is a great talent, and I have been a fan of his since his Wham! days. On this particular CD, his voice is nothing short of mesmerizing. My two favorite tracks are ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,"" re-done by many following Roberta Flack's until now unmatched version (utter perfection by George) and ""Miss Sarajevo,"" on which George's smooth as silk flawless voice is accompanied by a fabulous guitar. When I listen to this CD, his voice is so clear, so fabulous, so intimate and heartfelt, you feel like he is in the room with you. In my humble opinion, this is a must have for any collection of music."
2,George where did your heart go?,"First I would like to say I have been a George Michael fan since I don't know when, defending him at every turn. But this was absolutely the most horrific..... Sorry George! You've changed, come back! I'll still never forget the good old days when you were awesome. However, you have had two or three really great singles. Go with that style, that is what made you a superstar not being a lounge lizard, okay? STILL LOVE YOU, GEORGE! REGARDLESS!"
5,smooth & silky,"I've waited for years to hear this man share his voice with this kind of mood. Soft, easy, melodious. It sets a mood for love. His voice is like silk running over your body leaving you warm, contented, and feeling just a little nostalgic. A true talent. More or less one overall mood. A perfect CD to put in a mix of music for that overall balance of style, and a perfect cd when you just want that quiet peace. A voice made by angels.Enjoy!"
1,Sadly disappointing,"I have been a George Michael fan from his Wham! days, and this was such a let down. It is so sad that this wonderful, talented artiste has come out with a set of re-made songs, that don't even sound good. Where did the old George Michael go? I want him back!"
5,Unprecedented,I am going to buy this CD although I havent heard any of the songs. I can say that this artist has musical talent and originality in abundance as I have a collection of all his previous work. This is his first new album to be released in about four years and I know I wont be disappointed Rock on George!
4,"George is a talented singer/songwriter, but","I like George Michael, but I'm not sure if his song selection made much sense. Anyway, the quality of the songs are so much higher than 99% of the garbage out there (especially hip-hop and rap), that you really can't fault this record"
3,Just because it is George,"This collection was a hit back when but time has not been kind. The songs are all classics and should be a valuable addition to any collection and yet the delivery and phrasing seem staged and in some cases down-right coy. Sometimes the vocals are actually weak sounding. Not at all what I thought it would be but because it was a stretch, at the time it was recorded, I give it an additional star for effort."
4,Wonderful Trip to Yesterday,"Yes this CD is NOT for everyone. But that being said I thought it was masterfully done. From Doris Day's ""Secret Love"" to ""Brother Can You Spare a Dime"" the tracks are fulled with emotion and power of an artist not afraid to move out of his expected nitch and risk everything to explore another side of himself. So if you're up to a little old fashioned style I think you'd be pleasently suprized. - Jim Chappelle, L.A. CA."
4,George Michael - songs from the last century,"I liked Wham, liked George's solo music even more. Songs from the Last Century is very different. Those that like George's more upbeat music may not like this. Those that like laid-back, jazzy, mellow music of the old days will enjoy this as I have. George has a superb voice and it's good to see him use it for things other than pop-ditties."
2,Let's Talk About Something Else,"I was a little disappointed with this movie. The plot lacked sustenance and did little to really keep me entertained.Worth seeing one time perhaps, I wouldn't really waste my time watching it over and over. If you are looking for a humorous movie, this probably won't provide you with many laughs. There are a couple of laughable moments, but they are short lasted.If you decide to skip seeing this movie, I would say it is a safe bet that you won't be missing too much."
2,Somewhat boring,"Was expecting considearbly more from a Poul Anderson novel.The pace is slowish, the adventures of Eodan, future Odin, not so awe inspiring as one would assume.There are considerably better Poul Andrson's novels out there!"
3,Almost perfect,"The photo shows Moxy in the light blue but when I recieved the item she was pink, it would have been nice to know the actual color"
4,Great Asset to Anyone Applying to MSW programs,This book was great. It answered many of my questions about the application process and gave me a comprehensive understanding of MSW programs. It has information inside of it that is nowhere to be found on the web. The profiles of programs in the back was *extremely* helpful. My only desire is that there were even more schools profiled (some of my programs did not make an appearance). Excellent aid for applying!
2,Poor Book Selection,This Book did not help me do anything but get worried about writing my personal statement for Graduate School. I wound up buying another book that made me feel much better and really helped me write my essay.
3,This album is good,"This album is pretty good I copped it when it first came out. All in all it is pretty good, and you should also check out ""Get It Krunk"" By S.E.T. a.k.a Toochie Loc & J-Blu."
5,ME DOY EL LUJO DE REÍRME DE MIS,"COLEGAS ( soy médico )que duermen una horra menos que yo y salen de jogging como perros perseguidos por el antirábico...mientras que yo TENGO MEJOR CONDICION FÍSICA, MUSCULATURA Y APARIENCIA QUE ELLOS...Se mueren por saber como le hago..pero es secretito: Hago mis ejercicios mientras voy en el coche rumbo al consultorio, cuando esoty viendo a un paciente y hasta hablando por teléfono !Este libro ES LA BENDICION FÍSICA MAS GRANDE QUE EXISTE !"
4,lovely stuff,"better recording quality, wider note range, and (as always) fantastic lyrics. wish it was longer, though. definitely worth your money."
4,great for the toddler boy,"I bought this for my nephew for his 3 year birthday. He loves anything Batman and he loves to go fishing with his dad. So, this seemed like the perfect gift for him. He loved it immediately and when he was told what it was for, he was even more excited.The item is easy to use and learn. The kid themed design and size work perfect for my nephew and makes it that much more appealing for him to learn how to fish with his dad. It casts well enough for what a child needs it for and the reeling works great too! I would recommend this for anyone who has a child looking to learn to fish."
3,Not The color I expected,They are quite pale and not as green as I expected.Still they are quite big and they feel nice.
1,"No packet arrive until October, 25th.","Hello,one month ago - I ordered three shirts, paid by Visa - and you get the money - but I get no shirts. By call I should get a trackingf number, I only got these review.So let me know, wehere are my shirts ..ThanksWolfgang Burger"
5,Great Everything u want to know!!,"Well i first ordered this book after a while of looking at everything about the GT40. It was a great choice. This book tells u everything, it has pages of race records and chassis records that are easy to understand, it has a whole lot of history and it is just a well written book. Enjoy!"
3,Good but not great,"It's ok and is what it is. In retrospect, I think I would have been better off just sticking with the straight hose."
1,CONTAINS LEAD,"I was pretty irritated to find a warning on the label indicating that this product CONTAINS LEAD. I have little children around the house so I can't have this hose. I'll be returning it. Warning: ""THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS CHEMICALS, INCLUDING LEAD, KNOWN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE BIRTH DEFECTS AND OTHER REPRODUCTIVE HARM. WASH HANDS AFTER HANDLING.""I'm very disappointed that Amazon doesn't disclose warnings like this in their ads."
1,"Actually,","Just in response to Michael E Walton's review, The Insyderz (a ska/rock/rap band) also do Christian Rap well. As a matter of fact, KRS-One also 'guest raps' on some of their `preach-ier' songs, and it doesn't sound half bad.'Now lets all grab our instruments, and get down with Jesus.'P.S. This album is pretty bad. Support Ska."
4,How could you criticize Chris???,What I love about KRS is that he is real. Reguardless of how much of a Christian you are you have to respect this album. These are his beliefs and not just what the preacherman tells him to believe. He is an elite thinker and I think he deserves respect for it. This album is diverse and has something for everyone. Anyone who says they dont like this or that has something nice to say about the rest. Every Christian has things about the religion they arent sure of or just dont believe in. Its the way the world works and I'm glad he didnt take the holier than thou approach on this work.
4,"Bump the first review, KRS is on top of his game","To make it short, the beats could have been a bit better for some tracks but the lyrics are very well done. Even if you ain't feelin the beats, the rhymes definately make this album worth listening to."
4,Spiritual Minded,"After going on two decades of keeping folks uncomfortable with his lyrical observations, KRS-One has figured out a new way to make 'em squirm: touting Christianity, which he's apparently embraced post-9/11. Fusing gospel with hip-hop isn't a new idea--BB Jay, who guests here on ""God Is Spirit,"" is one of several who've done it--but given KRS-One's history of preaching self-reliance, instead of faith in a higher power, Spiritual Minded qualifies as a surprising move. Especially when, amidst rhymes on standard topics (Martin and Malcolm, the Diallo incident, etc.), he asks ""What happened to God in schools?"" and lets guest T-Bone take an unfashionably hard look at Islam. If the beats and backings were as consistently daring, this could have been a great album; as it is, strong moments like the spare, gospel-laced boom-bap of ""Lord Live Within My Heart"" and ""The Conscious Rapper"" make it a sermon that's still worth hearing."
4,A Groovy Roll All The Way,This is a great funky album. Nothing heavy just a whole lotta great groove here. Green and Patton play off each other like they've been jammin' together for years. Buy it and put your dance shoes on 'cause it'll make you shake your body! Great stuff.
4,Talented Young Man,I've listened to Kachief since he was starting out and his voice has matured a great deal. He's a talented singer and I look forward to hearing more from him in the near future.
3,Doesn't pack the punch you might expect.,"Like many crooners whose careers have lasted through the decades, Tony Bennett's voice has changed a great deal. These early tracks are a tad shrill, and don't have the smoothness you might expect if you are a fan of any Bennett songs since the 60's. More ballads than swing."
5,Basie swings and so does Bennett...,"Basie actually only appears on two of the 12 tracks, Bennett's long time arranger/pianist Ralph Sharon, is on the remaining 10 trcks, Sharon also is the arranger for this session, though his arrangements were very Basie-ish. Bennett sounds happay as ever to be backed by the Basie Big Band. This is one of Bennett's finest sessions of the 50's, and shows beyond a doubt how great of a jazz singer Tony Bennett is, yes I said JAZZ SINGER, because that's what he is. Highly recommeded CD."
2,BEWARE 'JAZZ HERITAGE SOCIETY' BOOTLEGS!!!!!!!!,"Well, I guess the title says it all. After hearing the excellent sound on Roulette's COUNT BASIE STORY album, I was excited to pick this one up, expecting the same kind of crisp, clear fidelity. Imagine my surprise to find a CD-R with a cheap press-on label with the words ""Jazz Heritage Society"" on it. Terrible -- it sounds like it was dubbed off an old eight track or something. The roaring Snooky Young-led brass section is reduced to a muddy mumble.Moral of the story: don't settle for anything but the real McCoy -- Basie and Bennett deserve much better. Four stars for the music, minus two stars for the ripoff."
5,Effective dog deterrant,"My neighbor's dog likes to charge our fence and bark aggressively when he sees us nearby (scares my kids). I sprayed a thin layer of Scoot Squirrel along the top of the fence, and the dog wouldn't go near it. After a few minutes he gave barking all together. Though not the intended application, it worked great and didn't hurt the dog."
2,JSP,This book covers only the basic concepts and is very similar to JDeveloper help.I was going through the JSP examples thatare included in this book. This book has examples how to create a List of Value.It does not allow saving a record once you select an item from a list.It really does not work. I found this book is little helpful but one can get thathelp from JDeveloper help.
1,Don't purchase if you intend to migrate to 10g,"This book contains a lot of material regarding BC4J and the jDeveloper IDE. Unfortunately, BC4J has been deprecated in 10g. [...]"
1,STUNNED!,"I guess I'm sort of a goofball in that my appreciation for comedy runs from the corny to the intellectual stuff. After listening to this I was truly stunned! I don't think a cannister of nitrous oxide would help elicit a chuckle from me while listening to this! I keep it just to amaze friends that there are SOME things I can find no humor in(none of them find any humor in this either-if they did, I'd worry about them). I think giving two ten-year old kids a tape recorder and letting them riff would be more likely to produce some humor. Don't get me wrong-there are other things on the Uproar label I enjoy very much,i.e. the classic National Lampoon recordings, but this is TRULY a waste. WOW!"
5,Buy!!,"This CD is great! I couldn't stop listening to it. It's one of the most hilarious spoken word CDs to come out in awhile. Plus, it's sure to be a collector's item, since it's a work of that world famous comedy magazine that has spawned some of the best American humorists. Listen to this CD!!!!!!I'm hoping some of the funny will rub off on me and I'll finally be able to get through those boring office meetings with a smile on my face."
1,A Tale of Two CDs,"You might think from the one star rating that this is a terribly unfunny CD. If so then you, my friend, are dead wrong. Let me explain: when I first listened to this CD I laughed so hard that I contracted polio. Now here I am, in an iron lung writing this review with my face. In conclusion, thanks Harvard Lampoon. Thanks, but no thanks."
5,"Brilliant writer, but not my cup of tea","Garry Disher writing style is unbelievable, but the story was a little too violent for me. I loved the line ""the dog ... yawned squeakily"". I'll definitely be adding his book on writing to my collection."
5,Gift for my mother,"I can't play it because I purchased it as a gift for my mother. I put it on a cd for her, and she loves it."
5,classic hag,"This is a great collection of classic Hag music including some familiar songs and several that I had not heard before. For a Haggard lover , it is a nice addition to a Hag collection."
5,maybe the best hag twofer,"Merle really comes into his own on these records. His voice oozes assurance. ""Hag"" has many great tunes and most come from his own pen, my favorite probably being ""Shelly's Winter Love"" but they're all great. Even better is the flipside LP, ""Someday We'll Look Back"". This is one of the greatest C&W records of all time, subtly flowing together and deepening with every listen. It isn't built around any monster hits, but I listen to it all day long. A beautiful record. As far as the packaging goes, they don't list musicians or chart info, which is inexplicable, but the center photo of a thoughtful Merle chilling on an old log clutching his guitar makes up for it."
4,Pretty good runner,"So far, so good. These shoes are extremely cushioned and are very comfortable. Not too wide like some NBs can be. I've run on them half a dozen times now and they're great so far."
3,Wharton on Decision Making,"The book contains a number of interesting papers on various aspects of decision making. Several of the articles have an annoying propensity to reference research studies that support a proposition or theory, but give no details whatsoever about the content or context of the research. There are, however, several articles that come at the rather large subject area from new and interesting directions."
4,Really liked it,"I enjoyed it but I'd have liked it to have more up tempo songs.I'm not really fond of her lasts works, too depressing."
5,Great album,"This is a classic GE album, and might even be their best. Ce Soir (Kill Me) obviously gets a lot attention because it's a cool song. It starts out calm and mysterious, and builds up with a nice intensity. Not to skimp on classiness, the band throws in cellos and strings to flavor the song. Lead singer Barry Hay sounds reminiscient of Mick Jagger at times.Another great song is Tons of Time. This was the opening track for Side 2 in the record days. It sort of has a reggae-rock feel to it. Love is a Rodeo and The Switch are also noteworthy. But really all the songs are good. The album almost comes across with a bit of a concept album feel too."
2,Don't waste your time,"The only GE album worse than this is 1977's Contraband, the worst of them all. Now I know lots of fans are crying, ""BLASPHEMUS!!"", and I mean no offense to them, but this album is as mediocre as mediocre gets. Why waste your time on this when Golden Earring has better music out there? ""Tons Of Time""? ""Troubles And Hassles""? Give me a break. This is definetely GE at a low point.If you want GOOD 70's Golden Earring, check out Together and Moontan.Recommended Golden Earring albums:LAST BLAST OF THE CENTURYBLOODY BUCCANEERSTOGETHERNEWSNAKED IIIMILLBROOK USAMOONTAN"
1,A big let down!,"I have to say the same thing Galvin did, how to Golden Earring go from their Masterpiece Moontan to this? This album was really terrible, I hated it back in the 70's when it came out and once a decade I listen to it again and it doesn't sound any better. I can't imagine what other people are hearing to give this album great reviews? Even 1976 To The Hilt was a big improvement over this although STILL no Moontan. These are just badly written songs and too simply produced. Moontan was a masterpiece of interchanging parts of songs, changing instrumentation, tempo, affects, and awesome finales. These are just simple songs nothing very catchy about any of them. No wonder there was no hit singles, Twilight Zone would come later though! I really believe people like this album because of the era it was released, like some sort of nostalgia."
1,"Boring, unsympathetic, baby boomer whining","As a white male from a privileged background myself, I found this book to be especially tiresome and pointless, and stopped reading about 20 pages in. I get that us white males can still be fascinating subjects of TV shows and movies, even if we're unsympathetic jerks, but that only works if we're mildly interesting. That's not the case here. Also, this is not a book about ""growing up in the 70s"". The protagonist is a freshman in college by the time 1975 rolls around."
2,Self-Loathing Narcissism in Poetic Prose,"Pleasant Hell is proof that nihilism goes hand-in-hand with narcissism. While Dolan can write well enough to keep the eye moving across the page, he is a morally bankrupt, misanthropic narcissist who's contempt for anything that might be considered decent has twisted him into a self-hating atheist. This literary artifact is useful as a case study in abnormal psychology and/or as a warning to those who might abuse powerful drugs."
1,"I was there, Johnny","5 stars for writing, 1 star for wisdom. I grew up in Pleasant Hill and was at the same school, at the same time, as Dolan. The actual town was quite different than he describes, and a great place to grow up, but this book is The World According To John, a subject he is as enamoured with as his own pain.If you like extremely well-written loser books, especially losers who steadfastly, bitterly, proudly remain losers, this is a must. But if you, as I do, believe that it's pathetic and spiritually bankrupt for an author to take personal revenge by using people's real names, don't buy this book.Don't put money in the pocket of this sad man who said in an interview that he spends his free time plotting the revenge he will extract from them when he returns to America.Perhaps Dolan imagines he has written the new Catcher In The Rye, but he is no Salinger. No compassion mars his unprogressing soul."
1,"literature, this is not","In the last twenty years I think the bar for what is considered good writing or great writing has been lowered. I admit, I only read the book half through on a flight from Denver to L.A. and found the execution of his ideas mediocre. Maybe that's why the last person left it behind."
5,saturnine comic genius,"Dolan certainly has genius and he may yet prove to be a great writer. If the author, a reclusive Californian intellectual who purportedly alternates between Auckland and Moscow, expired tomorrow, then Pleasant Hell at least would stand as a solitary testament to the deceit and parasitism which characterise our breed, much like Ducasse's Maldoror or Thomson's The City of Dreadful Night. Yet with brilliant originality, Dolan offers a strange vision of hope: beyond redemption, the psychological freedom which inheres in authentic expressions of nihilism emerges as the author's great theme. It is a theme to be savoured as our brainwashed cousins continue to sweat out their lives in the tumid megalopolises which will surely prove our extinction. This is an outstanding novel; if you're smart, and looking for a real writer, then by all means READ THIS BOOK."
2,Song 7 Therory out the window,"The first half of this album is classic and falls inline with all the greats on their other albums. Song 7 on all the albums has been something to look foreward to up until Push the Button. This albums' seven, Right Left, should have be Left Out and the rest of the album (Songs 8 thru 11) probably should have been too. This could have been an amazing EP by only using the fist six songs. Would have saved us a couple of bucks too. Still worth a listen. I recommend borrowing it from a friend."
3,Push the (FFWD) button every other song,"I have a hard time with albums that lack cohesion. Last year I had an opportunity to listen to a number of them, productions that blend in diverse artists and producers to collaborate in someone's new album. The result: typically, a musical pastiche. That's what the new album from the Brothers feels like to me.There are some great moments in ""Push the Button"" that let you know that the magic is still there, but then come the flops, songs that just don't belong in there or simply don't feel like they came from the heart of The Chemical Brothers. These are the songs that make you feel like pushing the FFWD button to skip them, and that is a first time with these guys, so I cannot give them more than three stars. BUMP!"
5,Their best work,"I've listened to all their albums a million times, and this album has to be their best. Unlike most bands that lose their edge over time, this album is like throwing pine needles on the camp fire, because it is hot!"
4,My favourite album by the Chemicals.,"With all their other albums, there are always tracks I really like a lot and some I'm not so keen on, but with this one, I like all of it. A good dancey album, from the brilliant ""Galvanize"" to the end. Stand out track for me is the brilliant hip hop inspired ""Left Right"". Most tracks have a slightly different feel to them than the rest, even though the upbeat dancey theme seems to run throughout. Great!"
2,Poor Effort.,"I picked up the CD for 1 reason and that was the opening track ""Galvanize"". Great track with Q-Tip and Morroccan samples added to the Chemicals trademark thumps. Then I listened to the rest of the album and was dissapointed by all the songs. Nothing new and no substance to any of the remaining songs. This has finally made me realise that DANCE MUSIC IS DEAD."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"wow...i am really surprised to see all of the excellent reviews for this album. there is nothing fun or interesting about any of this. drawn-out beats and elementary clicks and beeps with vocals that barely fit into place. it is a far cry from ""groundbreaking"" material, which almost everyone that has written a review seems to think. if you have experienced the likes of real electronic music...you will find this very plain and uneventful. Exit Planet Dust was the only thing The Chemical Brothers should be proud of. it was produced with a very spontaneous and driving sound to it, unlike the rest of their work. why is this getting 4 and 5 stars from people? is this some kind of joke?"
2,Chemical Brothers get political...,"There are a few good CB songs on here, like Galvanize or Hold Tight London and especially the last two songs, however they have some flat out embarrasing tracks as well. One just features some guy who keeps screaming ""REVOLUTION!"" with some weak beat in the background, and there's also the infamous ""LEFT RIGHT, LEFT RIGHT, MY PEOPLE MARCH!"".... oh god....Electronica shouldn't be political, I cringed enough to Deadmau5's ""raise your weapon"" but this is on a whole 'nother level, it's like the Black Panthers broke into the CB's recording studio to 'get da message out'. Surface to air is an appropriate album closer title, because the whole rest of the album I felt like I was drowning in political BS. Unless you love hearing about da Revolution than take a few of the songs I mentioned and let the rest of it drown in it's own pretention."
2,Listen to it before you buy it,If you are an old school Chemical Brothers fan then I really don't think you will like this music. Make sure you listen to it before you buy it. If you like everything the Chemical Brothers have produced then buy it. It was a little too different for me.
4,Nice...,"Yeah... great disc.This is killing me... help would appreciated:What's being sampled in ""Surface to Air""? It sounds SO familiar."
1,OUCH! My achin' ears!,"I've had these headphones for 2 years, using them off and on, because apparently the pain they inflict upon my ears is like childbirth in that I keep forgetting how bad it is. I should have trashed them a long time ago, but I'm a tightwad. The sound is satisfactory, but I can only wear them for about an hour before my ears get SUPER sore. Since I work in an open office, I don't really have a choice but to listen to music with headphones, but at some point I just have to stop because it hurts so bad. I was on the site shopping for some new headphones, and thought I'd do (hopefully) some of you a favor by warning you about this. Good luck."
3,this is ok,"it is pretty good. it gives good quality, not the best, but it handles the bass and treble very well."
3,Best producer I've heard since Dr. DRE,"I really like this album. This guy shows very diverse musical styles. I think this guy, Xta-c, will be around for a long time. I notice he produced all the songs except for one. All the tracks are nice and the guy seems to have a lot say. I would have given him four are five stars, but he has to many other people flowing on his songs. My favorite song on the album is Badd Mann. It reminds me of some old Spice 1. This is going to be the next artist to take the rap world by storm.If not as an artist, he will be the next producer everybody goes to see."
1,this book should have never started,"Another reviewer said it and I totally agree: this book was torture. Jane Green, girl what were you thinking. Did you even proof read it. Its like you put your makeup on in the dark for the first time and then walked out in broad day light. I loved Jane Green's Jemmima J. (funny light book for a rainy day). I don't know what happen with this one. Slow pace, no real depth to characters, vague plot. My niece gave me the book and I was bored to death so I read it. I do not recommend you spend your money on this. It doesn't even deserve one star.The main problem with this book is that it never got past the introduction!!!"
1,Awful,"This book is why ""chick lit"" has such a bad name. It's full of cliches, boring characters and has a ridiculous plot. It's as if the author was asleep when she wrote it. If she was,though, maybe she would've come up with an original idea. The main character, ""Cath"", is heartless and self-absorbed. Then you have the obligatory ""gay man"", the happily married couple,the glamorous bitchy friend, and the ""perfect"" boyfriend. It's chick lit by numbers and is absolutely awful. And the ""AIDS"" lecture at the end is insulting and out of place in a supposedly romantic novel."
4,A book lover's delight,I really enjoy reading all of Jane Green's books. I love her humor and how real her characters are. This book is particulary a good book by the way the characters come to life. You learn to hate them and then forgive them. Unexpected ending.
5,Jane Green is a Must Read Author!!,I thought this was just another wonderful book by Jane Green. She is definately a must read for me. The binding friendship in this story truely warms your heart. I can see great possibilities of a Hugh Grant movie here (although I'm not certain what character would best suit him).The book was not as predictable as many are. And I think that is what I like about Jane Green. It's a story of people in a life situation and could continue on. She writes about real people situations and feelings and when the book is finished I am left feeling good and wishing for more. I love British authors!
3,Not a bad way to spend your reading time,"This book has some mechanical problems (ie. she keep throwing in things about the characters that were supposed to be old habits, but had never been mentioned before) but overall, the story wasn't bad. I still feel that Mr. Maybe was her best book, just because of the lively conversational tone the main character maintained throughout the book. While this book is written in first person, you wouldn't always remember that. It isn't the best effort Jane Green has done, but it is worth reading. I laughed and cried...crying is a first for me regarding a Jane Green novel, so it has it's moments of warmth and good writing. Take it to the beach, enjoy."
3,Definitely a fun summer read...,"...but don't expect too much from this book. Don't get me wrong...I really enjoyed reading about the characters and their lives in London, but I felt that the ending of the novel turned it into a whole other novel altogether (and I don't want to spoil the end for anyone who hasn't read it). And I wasn't completely satisfied with the characterization of Cath, and how they develop Portia's role. My favorite parts were Cath's rapport with Si and with James...everyone else seemed a little too perfect or underdeveloped. I read the book in two afternoons, so it was something I couldn't put down, so it's something you can certainly bring with you to the beach."
4,Pleasant Surprise,"I have grown increasingly bored with the never-ending stream of ""chick-lit"" books that spew the same plot in different formats. ""Bookends"" sat on my bookshelf, along with a few other unread titles, for quite some time as I have refused to waste my time with another Bridget Jones wannabe...How surprised I was only one chapter into this novel..not at all what I had expected. This book reminded me of the beloved Maeve Binchy books- with strong character developments and an integrated plot centered around many characters as opposed to just one.This book was rich and fulfilling, not shallow and mildly depressing like the chick-lit which has permeated our society. Anyone looking for an uplifting change from the usual- pick this one up! You'll read it in two days."
1,The WORST book I've ever read!!,"I can't believe I finished it, and I only did because I bought the book and didn't want to waste 15 bucks! (Even though I did)This book is soooooooo super boring... Nothing happens in the main charaters life unil the middle of the book... then something random happens, then back to boring. The writter ofen forgets what she was talking about and skips stuff she previously mentioned. Then when something life changing happens, she remembers!Blah Blah Blah.. SOMETHING RANDOM AND UNEXPECTED.. Blah Blah Blah.. OF THE WALL OCCURRENCE.. and so on, and so on...This book was horrible! I've heard that Jane Greens other books are great, but I don't think I'll ever buy a Jane Green book ever!"
2,Not worth your three hours,"I bought this book because I loved Jane Greene's previous novel, Mr. Maybe. However, I was greatly disappointed by this recent effort. Maybe it's unfair to compare her books, but I am (although i would never admit it to many people) a fan of this ""girl looking for love"" genre of books, and this was probably one of the most boring ones I've read. Unlike Mr. Maybe, the writing was simply boring and the dialogue was stilted and the plot was predictable from the very beginning. Many other books in this genre are predictable as well but you read to find out how the ending happens. In Bookends, I read it halfway and was so bored by the story and characters that I didn't even want to finish it. I thought a lot of the side stories were unnecessary and didn't really serve a purpose and the character development, wait..what character development. Anyway, if you're going to read a Jane Greene novel, Mr. Maybe is the one to go with. Its funny, sassy, witty, and much more entertaining."
3,Bookends lacks the fun,"Bookends lacks the fun that made Jane Green's other novels so interesting. This book tries too hard to stay on the Brit chick lit formula, and instead of producing a witty, enjoyable bit of brain candy, you get a dry, dull run, where everything seems forced and nothing is all that funny."
3,"Definitely some twists & turns, but not Green's best","I loved Jemima J. by Green because it was a breezy, fun, heartwarming, and engaging romance, so I was thrilled to check out Bookends. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed with Bookends because while it is a nice, easy read, it is not a story about lovers. If you're looking for a page-turner about whimsical romances, this isn't the one to pick. I do give Green thumbs up for twists and turns in the plot. She definitely caught me off guard, which is refreshing, because Jemima J. was pretty predictable.Green does a nice job of tying everything up in the end, but the first half of the book drags, in my opinion. I kept saying, ""OK but . . . where is this going?"" Still, if you're a fan of Green, Bookends is worth the read; afterall, it's a story of friendships---the good and the bad---with interesting surprises, too."
3,Not Green's best,"I rushed to get this novel from Amazon.UK when I first heard about it. I have read all of Jane Green's other novels that are published in the USA and have loved them. Well, this one did not live up to my expectations.As someone who's dream it is to open a book store, I was hoping that this book would be a light, tender read just like Green's others. I was expecting it to be primarily about two women opening up the store. But I found that this was just a small part of a much bigger, much less enjoyable story. The idea was top notch, but the follow through was mediocre at best.The characters were all likeable, albeit not too deep aside from one catastrophic event that I will not give away. The plot (or plots) never developed for me, and I was left disatisfied in the end. I would love to read more from Jane Green, but hope that this was just one glitch in an otherwise perfect writing career."
4,Lots of fun,"Maybe it's because I love bookstores or because I love British writing, but I really enjoyed this book. Green created characters I wanted to read about, friendships that were believable, and a story line that kept me interested. I've enjoyed Jane Green's books in the past (Jemima J), but I think that this is my favorite one so far."
3,Light and Fluffy,"Bookends is just what I expect from Jane Green: a quick, predictable, comfy read for a hot day. After all, when it's 101 degrees, who wants Proust? The characters are likable, and I found the plot to be far less contrived than Green's earlier Jemima J.However, there were several jarring errors in sentence structure which Green's editors should have corrected."
3,This book was ok....,"I didn't hate this book...but I didn't love it either...it's saving grace was definitely the character ""Si"". I did find most of the others endearing, but I've got to tell you..I often flipped ahead to see how many more pages I had until I was through...maybe it's because at heart I'm a romance junkie...or maybe its because having read other books by Jane Green I expected better......whatever the reason..I just found this book to be little more than mediocre."
2,I wanted to like this book.,"Having avoided ""Jemima J."" and ""Mr. Maybe"" for many months at the bookstore where I work, I finally picked up ""Bookends"". What a disappointment! So many ends and no one to tie them...So many semi-interesting characters bumping into each other. I found Green's writing style somewhat jarring. Some scenes took pages and pages, while others were jammed five on a page. The intial exposition was rather boring, and after 20 pages or so of straight description, I was thinking of giving up.I did enjoy the bookstore setting, and felt that more could have been done with that. At a certain point, with the relationship aspects, I began to think, ""Get on with it, already!"" Points off for boring dialogue, a child and a nanny who got on my nerves, and ""fill-in-the-blank"" stereotypes for characters. Points for a bit of charm, an engaging premise and the fact that I actually DID finish it so somehow I cared what happened to at least a few of these characters."
4,Captivating!,"This novel was hard to put down and was a fast read. Green does an excellent job pulling the reader into the story of a close-knit group of friends struggling through life's changes.There were a few instances when things I noticed in the writing style drew my attention away from the story line, but those instances definitely did not detract from Green's adept usage of character development and plot.Overall, it's a lighthearted, enjoyable read!"
2,Borrow it from a friend or the library,"I borrowed this book from a friend and am extremely relieved I did not buy it myself. While the plot and characters had excellent potential, it was never fulfilled. The writing style in this book really distracted me from what could have been a good story. Green uses too many long descriptive passages to describe situations and does not develop other situations fully. Others are just plain unbelievable (i.e., Cath discussing her bookstore dream and Lucy calling on the very next page, wanting to collaborate). I had picked the book up for light reading, but had expected much better (more like Bridget Jones)."
3,Really 3 1/2 stars,"The circumstances for reading this book were perfect. It has been raining, I had a cold and a few days off to recover. I wanted something light and this was really made for that kind of read. It doesn't touch the ""CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC"" series as far as writing and character development but it kicks 'BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY"" butt for plot and likeablitly. I had the plot twists figured out before they twisted but the everyday ""Cath"", the main character is so honest and charasmatic that you can't help but miss her when you are done with the book. I love the way the author doesn't really take issue with her weight either way. Some critics have mentioned it is the tale of a ""plus-size"" girl (maybe because of Jemima-J) but there is never any mention of her size other than the normal struggle every girl has.How refreshing to have a realisic heroine for once. I don't always want ""happy ever after"" endings but I was in the mood for this one. Loved it."
3,Bookends,"Not as light of a read as Jemima J. A more mature book with some dark tones. Some of the deeper parts of this book did not feel as though they belonged or were necessary.The ending was a bit of an easy out on all fronts, but still an entertaining read."
3,Not as good as Jemima J,"After reading Jemima J (also by Jane Green) I couldn't wait to read this one! Although I very much liked this book, I didn't LOVE it as I did Jemima.The central character is Catherine Warner; scatterbrained, messy, ready to make a career change, a hopeless romantic and always there for her circle of friends.Catherine lives in London with her best friend Simon (Si) who is tidy, bitchy and also looking for Mr Right. The circle of lifelong friends is completed with Josh and Lucy, who are happily married with Max, a handful of a toddler.In walks Portia, the stunningly beautiful college friend who's known for breaking hearts. Her reappearance unleashes a series of events - the biggest of which leaves all of the friends surprised!""Bookends"" is a story about friendship - twists, turns, complications and how it weathers loves, marriage, children and most of all growing up.It's a light quick read. A perfect Summer book!"
2,OK Chick Lit,"This book starts off marvelously, introducing us to young people at the beginning of their university careers, with the foreshadowing that they will have an impact on one another's lives forever. The characters are carefully drawn and the situations believable. But alas, then they graduate. Much of what happens to them as adults is highly predictable. I was only carried along by the sizzle and excitement of the early chapters. This is my second Jane Green book, and the second time she's underwhelmed me. From now on, when I need a Chick Lit fix, I'll stick with the superior Marion Keys."
2,Not one of the best chick lit reads,"I've only recently begun to read the ""chick lit"" genre. Initially I was hesitant about reading ""chick lit"" books until I read both of the Bridget Jones books and Can You Keep A Secret. After those books, I was a convert, so I picked up ""Bookends"" with the expectation that I'd be laughing out loud again in no time.Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Not only was ""Bookends"" not that funny, it meandered all over the place. I was looking forward to reading about Cath, the narrator, but I felt like her storyline- her relationship with James after spending years avoiding becoming involved with men- was treated like an afterthought. I was glad she also branched out career-wise with the bookshop, but that wasn't an interesting story. Lucy and Josh's marital issues weren't explored all that fully, and then it got unexpectedly serious with Si's shocking news.I'm still going to read ""chick lit"" books, but I'm glad this isn't the first one that I picked up!"
2,I LOVE JANE GREEN - but BOOKENDS was PATHETIC,"As for my background with Jane Green - I thoroughly enjoyed reading both Jemima J and Mr. Maybe in 2 days (you know how it is, you just cant put it down!) and I've been anticipating Bookends' arrival since early in the year. Just got back from Japan the other day, and read it last night - IT WAS SHOCKING! I hated it - the style was Jane Green, but it just lagged, and was boring, and sometimes I felt like closing the damn thing - now we all know thats a little odd cosidering its a Green book. Oh well - I just would NOT recommend this, but Green's others, I would in a heartbeat!!!!!!! DONT READ THIS BOOK"
1,Horrible!,"I don't usually do reviews, but I always read them before I order books. I know the other reviews were basically good, but I really disliked this book. So much so that I didn't finish it. I forced myself to read at least half-way, and just couldn't go on. What a boring, lifeless piece of junk. Don't waste your money."
4,good then better,"the book started kind of slow for me, it was one I put down and ""got around to"" a few months later. I wound up finishing it in 2 days because it was so good!"
1,ARE YOU PEOPLE SERIOUS?!,Jane Green is the WORST author I've EVER read.It is quite remarkable that she CONTINUES to get published!The worst drivel I've ever read: ALL OF JANE GREEN'S BOOKS.Stop wasting your money!!
1,yeah it was definitly a torture B'&#304;G T&#304;ME,i hate this book i really regret reading this book spending my money and my time.i thought it was going to be good as always cz its jane green but no definitly a B'&#304;G NO!
2,Not great.,"This was a somewhat enjoyable book until about 2/3 of the way through it. It became an excrutiatingly slow read. However, if you want to read up on HIV and it's symptoms/emotions, you might enjoy it."
4,A Worthy Read,"Another winner from Ms. Green. This book is a light, witty read based around a character named Cath and her close-knit group of friends from college. We follow the lot of them as they make their way through their early thirties, bust mostly we watch as Cath matures and learns to let go of the past in order to embrace the possibilities of the future. This is a great novel to take to the beach or read over the weekend to relax."
5,Jane Green hits again!,"This book is an incredible read! I've become an avid Jane Green fan after reading Jemima J and Mr Maybe but this book ranks right up there with them! (I dare say maybe even above) It's a great story of love, old friends, dreams, and devastations. I literally cried at the end of this book and that always signifies amazing writing. I couldn't put it down.Green always writes such vivid characters with wonderful storylines. She continues to be witty and charming in her writing. Not to mention, the epitome of english humor. Love it, you should buy it, you won't be let down!"
3,Weak Start but worth sticking out.,"When I first started reading this book, which is my first Jane Green Novel, I found it weak and somewhat unbelievable. I was amazed at how this close group of college friends adored, upheld, and worshipped the 'hot' friend. I don't think many people do that and tend to see their friends for who they are. Anyway by the middle of the novel I was more involved and there were some unexpecting twists and turns and a great ending making the read worth it. I recommend borrowing the book and skimming the first few chapters until they areo ut of college."
3,Great book--most of it anyway,I loved this book three quarters of the way through...until a light read turned depressing very quickly. I thought the book was about Portia and her complicated friendship with the other three friends. Green seemed to drop that issue three quarters of the way through and throw a curve ball involving Si which seemed to have nothing to do with the original plot. Also--in real life--if you so rudely blow off a guy that many times and in that manner...no self respecting guy would go out with you again. I still enjoyed the book but didnt like being blind sided with too many unbelieveable plots twists towards the end.
2,(2.5 Stars) Not Her Best Work...,"Bookends follows the life of frumpy, 30-something ""Cath"" and her cliched circle of college friends as she decides to quit her high-paying job and fulfill her dream of opening a local bookshop. The characters for the most part lack substance or chemistry, and do nothing to distract from the predictable plot. Jane Green is a good author, but this is far from her best work. Instead I'd check out ""Jemima J"" or ""Mr. Maybe"", two of her previous books which succeeded in ways that this one failed."
4,Kind of a Modern 'Big Chill',"I read this book like I was watching a movie with a great ensemble cast, and I really enjoyed it. There were a few parts that were a little shaky and underdeveloped, but I liked these characters, and it was easy to get involved in their lives. As with most books by Jane Green, this one makes a good summer read."
4,Fun light read but.....,"..... fun an light but then suddenly becomes so serious and depressing. Gotta say I just wasn't thrilled with the sad ending....However, I did love the characters and the overall concept of the story. It is always a shock when an old friend (possibly one you may envy) comes back into your life, and this story follows a few friends as they experience just that.I love this authors writing style, and I really felt the narrator Cath was a close friend of mine throughout. I will seek more of this authors writing in the furtue."
1,Bookends Blathers On and On and On.....,"Minimum review length is 20 words. Twenty words is too much to describe this incredibly boring, insipid book. I read a lot and I can't recall when I haven't finished a book. Same with movies. I never walk out of them. I feel there has to be some redeeming quality. With Bookends, however, I just couldn't go on. Plot thin. Characters lifeless. Dialogue lazy. Just not worth it. Too many other good books out there to pick from. Like other reviewers of this book have said, -- I want my money back!"
3,Entertaining - Not as good a Jemima J or Mr. Maybe,"I enjoyed Bookends. I felt that it had a little bit of a different tone than both Jemima J and Mr. Maybe. I would recommend this book to any Jane Green fans out there, but just make sure you aren't expecting the light/romantic comedy-ish that was Jemima J and Mr. Maybe."
4,Friendships are tested,"Simon, Portia, Cath, and Josh were the best of friends in college. Portia eventually broke apart from ther group, while the other 3 continued their strong friendship into their 30s. At a pivotal moment in the lives of all 3, Portia surprises them by showing back up in their lives and things get very complicated.I liked Jemima J by Jane Green better than this book, but I certainly would consider this a good read. I even splurged and purchased it in the hardcover version (because the paperback took so long to be published).I think with most books there is a certain level of predictability but, again, Jane Green manages to through an unexpected twist or two into this novel as she did with Jemima J. One excellent thing about this book is the 'true to life' qualities it has - marital troubles & other relationship woes, occupational changes after starting your career, tension between best friends, etc..."
3,Not as good as Mr Maybe...,"Bookends is an interesting book, about some different characters that were best friends since College...It starts in a slow pace but it gets better from the middle to the end...The main character is not really looking for love, but like they say when you dont look you might find it...Not as good as Mr Maybe, but is a good book..."
2,Boring,I've only read a few of Jane Green's books and this one was not one of my favorites. It was boring and hard for me to get into. It was not about what I thought it would be and seemed to be more about Cath and Si. Not one of the better books. So far Mr. Maybe is one of my favorites by her.
5,Can't Get Enough,I CANNOT GET ENOUGH OF JANE GREEN!!! Loved it loved it loved it!!! I could not put this book down. I can relate a little bit to each character. I would recommend this book to any female from late teens to early 30's. I would give it 10 stars if the option was available!!!
3,Fun Light read but..........,"..... fun and light but then suddenly becomes so serious and depressing. Gotta say I just wasn't thrilled with the sad ending....However, I did love the characters and the overall concept of the story. It is always a shock when an old friend (possibly one you may envy) comes back into your life, and this story follows a few friends as they experience just that.I love this authors writing style, and I really felt the narrator Cath was a close friend of mine throughout. I will seek more of this authors writing in the furtue."
2,VERY light and superficial,"I was disappointed by the book. Amazon readers recommended it for lovers of Marian Keyes's books, but does not even come close to hers. The characters are one-dimensional, the plot is predictable and the language is unimaginative. A loss of time, IMHO."
2,Not what I expected,"After reading Jemima J (and loving it!) this book was such a let down. I literlly had to force myself to continue reading it. I found myself skipping pages hoping that it would get better, but I hate to say....it didn't."
2,Bookends- not so great,"I am a big fan of Jane Green- however, Bookends did not cut it for me. It was a little boring and I never finished it. On the other hand, Mr. Maybe and Jemima J. were awesome.Jill"
3,"Good underlying story, but it's well hidden","I've now watched the entire series, and it does eventually build into quite an intriguing little story. However, I think that it could have been made so much better if it had been shortened. I know that it was deliberately styled to be slow with each point being expanded upon, but I found that this obscured the underlying story. At some points, such as the first episode on Reset, I found myself watching what I would describe as a filler.If you're prepared to watch all the visual white noise, and pick out the plot line, you'll find an interesting tail about reality, and how we each perceive our place within it."
2,Beautiful but Odd,"Great artwork. Intriguing story that gets...very wierd. Hard to follow. It's like David Lynch on (even more) acid. Kindof a shame since it's an interesting concept, but one almost gets the feeling that the writers tried to do way too much with it. Artwork still makes it worth watching. Not sure if I'll bother with the later layers."
1,disappointing,"Made no sense. Boring. The weird animation was entertaining for a while but not enough to make up for the painfully slow ""plot."" In the grand scheme of anime, a big zero."
5,Is Lain the next step on anime?,"I really think so. Trying to explain Lain is a bit difficult, i have already seen the whole series and has left me wanting for more, this is not your usual anime which almost always suffers from poor scripting, a lot of things happen on the movie and i mean a lot. Some are answered clearly enough and some are left for the viewer to wonder. It may sound a bit cryptic, but i am telling it this way so whoever reads this review and is still doubting wheter to buy this or not answers himself this question: Do you like movies that make you think? If the answer is yes then buy it and do not worry about the vase. I really hope that they make more anime like this from now on"
5,Lain,"This is by far the wierdest anime I have ever seen in my entire life. The story is so spectacularly amazing, you will kill to get the next volume. It is a very well made dub, except lain, the main character, has a bad voice actor. It doesn't really matter, actions speak louder than words in this series anyway. It's rated mature not for gratuitous violence, nudity, or buckets of gore, but for a very adult storyline that will have you questioning your own existence. It's really out there, It's even almost as good as the vision of Escaflowne."
4,Might be a little TOO freaky for you. =),"WARNING! THIS ANIME IS VEEEEEEEERRRRRRRY FREAKY!The story begins when one of Lain's classmates commits suicide by jumping off her apartment. The next day at school, rumors have it that the dead girl is sending E-mail, but everyone thinks it's a prank.Later, Lain, too, gets an E-mail from the dead girl. The E-mail says it isn't a prank, and that the ""dead girl"" isn't really dead. Lain replies.A series of deaths and wierd/mysterious scenes follow, all connected with the Wired, or cyber-world.Over all, I give this anime four stars. If you're a fan of wierd/freaky anime, than this is right up your alley....You might never look at computers the same way again! Bwahahahahahahahahaha!"
5,The best anime out there!,Lain is a wonderful anime filled with a gripping plot and interesting story line. But I reccomend getting the entire series at once
1,"I tried to enjoy it, but I just dont get it","I love Anime and while I enjoy the genre immensely, I just did not like this series. I know that I am in the minority and I bought this DVD on the strength of all these reviews, but I found the entrire seires, incredibly slow and overwhelmingly boring.The quality of the animation is very good and the design of the characters and computers is top notch, but the story is so unbelievably lacking that I had to force myself to watch the entire thing and was absolutely disappointed at the end.I am not one of those people who need constant action or wanton violence to enjoy a movie either. I love great plot and strong dialogue, but this series does not have it in my opinion. This series is just a graphic art showcase of images that while beautiful, do not create a decent story."
5,"Computers and Schoolgirls, what more do you want?","Hello Navi.The first time I watched Lain, I was hooked. From the menu screen to the extras at the end, Lain is striking. The animation is very well done, and the plot is wonderfully cyber-punk. Each episode gives only enough information to keep you asking questions."
5,Great Anime,"This is a great Anime, I'd compare it to alot of the other greats. Like many series, weird things happen before you get answers. Very good series, Definately comparable to Neon Genesis Evangelion or Ghost in the Shell. I highly recommend it if you have time on your hands to contemplate many things."
5,Beyond Beyond,"Serial experiments lain is in a league of its own, one of the greatest anime I have ever viewed, both visually pleasing, and mentally pleasing. Nothing else compares. This truly is an impacting anime."
5,Not for everyone,"I typically shy away from buying a series. But this one is more like a long movie. It is original, and it keeps you guessing as the series evolves. (This applies to the whole Lain set.) It is not typical anime in that it is not saturated with violence, gunfire, and nudity. But for a mindbender, it doesn't get any better than this."
5,Confused Yet Convinced. . .,"The first time I watched this anime I thought,""BORING!"" It wasn't making any sense and it was kind'a 'Spacey' and 'Weird' but the more I watched it, I started to understand and was convinced that it was worth watching, as the main character, Lain's identity started to unfold...it turned out to be pretty cool! It makes me wish I had the latest Navi. But be warned, this anime isn't for everyone. Even if you ""get it"", there are a lot of questions that aren't answered and they kind'a leave you hanging. With patience and an open mind your more likely to get through this anime with satisfaction."
2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for an interesting and different film, but I was disappointed. It is different, but unfortunately boring. There are some aspects to the artwork that are unique (shadows have fun treatments) but thats about it. Otherwise, the artwork is a let down. The eyes on the main character (Lain) were a window to nothing and she really wasn't endearing. It was very slow and not a ""ghost story"". Maybe the next few layers get more excitng, but I'm sure the anime doesn't get better."
5,"Weird at first, but VERY engaging!","Even though I had to watch these series a couple of times in order to understand them fully, none the less I liked them all the same. If you like ""The Matrix"" you will love, ""Lain"". I love the intro music, also :-)"
1,There is a reason they give you 4 episodes on this one...,"This series doesn't get interesting until the last 30 seconds of the fourth episode. And even then, it doesn't get very interesting, at least not interesting enough to spend more money.The characters are very bland, and there is no empathy for their plights. The first episode is about a girl committing suicide- but why do I care? That question isn't answered, and her death is virtually meaningless.Is this series worth watching? Maybe. It has interesting ideas about the future of computing. Is it really worth watching all the way through? No, the entire series is as discordant and unworthwhile as this DVD, and much of it is RECYCLED FOOTAGE.A friend of mine suggested that you could reproduce the entire series using nothing but the first four episodes, and with the costs of DVDs, it is probably worth your while to try."
1,The Worst Anime Ever,"This is absolutely the worst anime I have ever seen. The story is slow, predictable and full of the same flashbacks ad nausiun. The artwork is boring.Just awful!"
2,I know I'm in the minority :-(,"Ok, lain is a series followinga young girl named Lain through her odyssy of computers, I really don't understand why so many people liked this, It has good animation, good voice acting and Lains character design isn't bad but the story was just strange, I found no attachment or empathy towards any of the characters and I had no Idea what the hell was going on, the only thing that attracted me to this video in the first place was I liked the opening and ending segments (which I still think are pretty good) so unless you get off on this type of freaky stuff I'd strongly recomend you stay away from this, or at least rent it to see what you think first."
2,Very pretty...but vacuous,"As beautiful as the animation often is, this has to count as a disappointment. At first sight you may think you're seeing some serious ideas about identity, and about the relationship between the real world and the virtual. But the writers apparently thought long, portentous silences and willful obscurity were acceptable substitutes for well-thought out themes and genuine insights. It's hard to care very much about Lain, with her constant gasps and maddening passivity, and everyone else in the series fades into gray. By the end it's clear the writers have lost track of whatever it was they were really trying to say. I wish I had nicer things to say about the series, but the visual look is really the only exceptional thing about it. Serial Experiments may be a break from the usual pyrotechnics and fisticuffs, but today's anime fans have a right to expect more."
4,It gets better,"Don't let this volume put you off the series. Things get much more interesting with episode #5. Yes, it's hard to get past the English voice acting, particulary for Lain and her friends, but stick with it, it's worth it. It could be that the actors speak the way they do to symbolize how disconnected people are from each other, or maybe the voice actors just stink. I bought this, watched it, and let it sit on my shelf, but I kept reading folks on Amazon saying how great the series is, so I decided to give it another chance and bought the second disc, and then finally discs 3 and 4 as well."
2,A bad try!,"The 1990 version of ""Lord of the Flies"" was a terrible recreation of the 1963 version. The 1990 version although made to fit modern times, was terrible. I feel that too many little things in the movie were changed, changing the feel the original ""Lord of the Flies"" gives you. While I watched the 1990 version all I could do was laugh. The characters in the 1990 version,ran around acting like idiots, and cursed alot, all the cursing and no character development took away from the meaning of the film. The 1990 version was so untrue to the novel."
2,Read the book,"Not as good as the second one (1990). It's filled with bad child actors, and seems to skip through a little too quickly without explaining what's going on very well. The book is much better in this regard of course. As usual, read the book. As a film, this just isn't very good. As a look into the savagery encoded in everyone, even the most highly educated well-mannered English boys, it's an excellent lesson in sociology and psychology."
2,I liked the book more...,"The movie was not as good as the book plain and simple and some of the scenes were choppy. Not to mention the acting was pretty bad (i.e Piggy meets ralph in the beginning of the film). and the didn't do the scene where simon talk to the pigs head. And compared to the book it was somewhat boring, so save yourself time and go read the book, but if for some reason you need to know the basic story line, I guess you can watch the movies, but I restate the movie is inferior to the book."
2,Where did the swearing go!!!,"Although William is a genius, the director of the movie stinks. They even let a 12 year-old kid say ""*%$& you!"" or ""Bull@#%&"". Well, these does not shown in the book anyway. If you think that's cool, spend some time on praying to God instead. Really."
2,Essential? eeeeh!,what I hate about criterion is they're overpriced this art house version is stripped down without the goodies! read the book way back in the day the movie did not live up to expectation problem with movies with kids is the bad acting! interesting story-line but loses focus & somewhat dull. survivor t.v. show in it's original form? every season should have a piggy character and gets killed by other tribe members!
1,Does not work,"The Lord of the Flies DVD was a gift for my fiance. He was very excited to unwrap this gift, but we were both very upset when we placed it in the DVD player. The DVD did not work. I'm not pleased with this purchase and will not be buying from the seller ever again."
2,extremly terrible adaption from the original.,"I can't believe what has happened to this wonderful, but creepy story. It has been chopped, and rearranged in a very awkward manner. Some important and key scenes aren't in the story at all! The movie didn't even exploit the message in the tale of man's dark nature. If Golding saw the movie version of his famous book, I think he would have been very disappointed. If I had it my way, I would had rearranged the story like the original. Read the book, its better."
4,The best film version of the Golding masterpiece.,"Initially, this film looks very low budget, but it's cinematic style tells the story very powerfully. I found myself engrossed with the film. The amateur cast of children rings very true to form, especially the actor who plays Ralph. The characters are very strongly realized. The sound appears off in a few places so I want to see if the DVD version coming out works over this problem. This version will get to you. The black and white film presents an atmosphere very faithful to the book. The later 90's version perverts the main idea by adding females and a living adult on the island. This alters the nature of the ""beast,"" and leads the story down a different moral path. See this black and white version. It'll stay with you. Simon's death and the final sequence are very disturbing and profound. I'm buying the dvd Criterion version when it becomes available in December!"
3,Lord of the Flies,As a film it is excellent but too extreme for general viewing. Is a milder version possible? A classical book does need a classical film so it is important.
4,"Excellent Product, Terrible Delivery","This video was exactly what I expected. I find it is more faithful to the novel in content and feel than the more recent adaptation. My sole disappointment was that I paid extra for overnight shipping, but did not receive the item in time to use in class as I had planned. It was a waste of money and a great inconvenience receiving this item three days late."
4,A pretty good adaptation of the book,"I have just finished watching this on T.C.M. and I can say that this movie is very close to the novel. I still kind of like the book better though. My guess is, the reason this film is in black and white is because of a budget shortage, and there is some book material missing. Other than that, this was a definite classic, and who says old movies are not good anymore."
2,Doesn't do the book justice,"I read this book for a school assignment and was affected by the plot. The complexity of the symbolism and how true it is to society shone out in the book. The film doesn't do the book justice as all. I feel that some of the dialogue that was cut out was essential to the plot and some scenes cheapened the meaning, making it almost laughable. The actors tried, they really did, I loved the performance by the actor who played Jack. But what happened to Roger in the movie? He was mostly cut out, except to suddenly appear out of nowhere to kill Piggy. Simon, who is my favourite character from the book, was played by an actor well suited to what he looked liked and how he acted, but there wasn't many chances in the movie to show Simon in the way he was intended to be shown. There was so much potential in this movie, but it just doesn't meet what I had hoped for."
2,Badly portrayed Goldings intentions,"This film was a slap in the face towards William Golding. The fact that crutial scenes were intentionally left out, lowered the quality and over-all feel of the story. By watching this movie alone the audience does not get the true sence of the savageness and chaos that the boys faced on the island. The book was an excellent example of great literary achievement, this movie makes it seem like joke."
3,"Not bad for a ""based on""","POSITIVE-It followed the book fairly well. The gory parts were not filmed- a fact my 10th graders questioned, but relieved me.NEGATIVE- Little naked boys in the final 10 minutes. I could have done without that!"
4,WE HAVE MET THE ENEMY AND HE IS US,"Peter Brooks' spartan adaptation of William Golding's immortal novel about a group of English schoolboys stranded on a desserted island still works nearly four decades after its initial release. Despite a total lack of star names and limited production values, the film succeeds thanks to yeoman performances from the child actors and an overall primitivism that makes the whole imminently believable. At first the castaways don't seem to have it so bad; there's plenty of food, no grownups, and no predators...except for perhaps one, a ""beastie"" that might be a weird animal or a ghost or something far worse...A moving, ever-poignant indictment of inherent human savagery, Lord of the Flies succeeds in translating the essence of Golding's tale to the screen. Like so many adults, the children think they're good enough to make their own utopia. So much for utopia. So much for childhood innocence."
4,"Good, if you're a fan.","If you're a fan of the book or the old movie, this DVD is a good choice. The extras are not to be missed, and they include some ""behind-the-scenes"" type of info, as well as some very interesting commentary from various people who worked on the film. The DVD brings back the original film in crystal clarity, no fuzzy VHS tapes like what you've probably gotten renting. This film is, however, in black and white and a bit longer than viewers are used to. If you're getting this for younger viewers, the newer version will probably be a better bet. It's in color, a bit more fast-paced, and definitely more modern. Only get this version if you are a collector or prefer the older movie."
4,Criterion is out of sync,"Criterion provides us with a clean transfer with some nice features, but why did they release it with an out-of-sync soundtrack?Enjoy this film classic if you can get past the intial distraction of what looks like bad lip-syncing."
4,Memorable and Fun!,"Just a wonder collection of songs for Marlenaincluding highlights ""Loving You Was Like AParty"", ""Feel Like Makin' Love"" and ""Street TalkingWoman""."
1,"Who is this Bitch,anyway?","I love Marlena Shaw, but this was a waste of money. If it were thicker & heavier I could have used as a door stop,but it's not, so it will be lost in a won't play stack."
5,STILL GREAT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS!,"I am reviewing the new collector's edition DVD for this film. The film itself is a true classic and still holds up beautifully. Jack Lemmon is in fine form as well as the entire cast. The print looks great on this edition and there are a couple of very good extras. One about Jack Lemmon and another about the film itself. The film won the Academy Award for 'Best Picture ' in 1960 and if you haven't seen it, maybe it's time you did. A rare insightful film that manages to balance comedy and drama to perfection."
2,Wait for a better release... whenever it comes.,"The video transfer is not that good, and no extras. This 5 star movie got a 1,5 star dvd. But deserves an AAA treatment instead. Too bad Jack Lemmon, Fred MacMurray and Billy Wilder are dead. But Shirley MacLaine is still there. I am sure we'll get the right DVD sooner or later."
3,Amazing,"Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine work great together. Jack lemmon is my old time favorite. And Shirley .. wow she is great.If you want to sit back and enjoy a great comedy, watch this you wont be disappointed."
