2,"Pretty, but virtually useless","I did not use this dish for canned food, because, as an earlier reviewer pointed out, it is rather small for that. Unfortunately, the dish cannot be used for dry food either. Every time my cat ate from this dish, he would scatter most of the dry food around the dish before eating the third of what I put in it (and I never put more than third of the dish in). I am returning it. Save your money."
2,"Looks nice, but far too small, and horribly wasteful packaging...","I ordered this, hoping it would have a two cup capacity, but there were no product dimensions on the page. I got it in today, and while the artwork looks high quality, and the bowl seems sturdy, it's far, far too small. It looks like it wouldn't even hold the capacity of one can of wet food very well.In addition, while Amazon usually has wasteful packaging, this was really horrendous. This was TRIPLE BOXED, with air packs AND packing peanuts.Amazon's box: 19x13x11.75open it up to findAnother box and air packsopen that up to findANOTHER BOX and packing peanutsInside that third box the product, which measures 7x7x2.5.I'm not happy."
4,did what it was supposed to do,I needed a book to show karate moves with illustrations and this did the trick. It's different forms and orders than some karate classes teach but gets the point across. It's a great cheat sheet!
2,I hate the brush,"I bought this by accident. I usually use this brand but its the ""lots of lashes"" one I was looking for. That one has a tapered, tear shaped brush that is made of a different material. I like it because no matter how many layers I apply, it does not clump. However, I decided to try this when it came in. I'll use this as a lesson learned because this mascara gets all over the place and clumps badly. I'm not sure if the other one I normally use is a different formula too, but I can see a huge difference between the two. This brush makes me have spider leg lashes if I apply more than one coat. Which, with this brush, you have to apply more or you may as well not wear mascara at all because one coat will not get your smaller lashes.I tried to make this one work, but after the third day of trying I went to CVS and picked up the stuff I normally use.now that I think about it, I think the formula must be different because it made my eyes water and itch a little too."
2,The brush is terrible.,"When I ordered black mascara, I was looking for full coverage on my lashes. Not just a little.The brush is made like my colored top-coats. Only made to cover a small part of your lashes and not look like your actually wearing mascara. I'll stick to my lash blast."
1,Caused an Eyelid Infection,"A few hours after trying this mascara, my eyelids were swollen and red and my eyes were burning. It got progressively worse before improving. It was supposed to be hypoallergenic! It is horrible. I buy inexpensive mascara all of the time but this one I will stay away from."
3,Dont like the brush,"i loved the mascara but the brush is SUPER small, its even smaller than the brush i have for eyebrows. Other than that i loved it, ive used this brand for a long time i have tried others and i keep going back to this one!"
1,Do not use Maybelline!,"Maybelline Soft Lash Mascara is the worst mascara i have ever used.I used this product about three years ago and i had a horrible reaction to it: severe itching, peeling, scaly skin.I'd never had any problems with reactions to mascaras before this.At the time, i googled this product and many, many others were complaining of the same symtoms.Ever since, i have had problems with the skin around my eyes. I wish i had sued them or something.I have since learned they test their products on animals. Can you imagine what the poor animals had to go through when they tested this product on them? Despicable."
1,"Painful and unpleasant, avoid at all costs","I've used Great Lash before, but I guess it was ""Very Black"" not ""Blackest Black."" Now I won't ever touch a Maybelline product again.First time I used the mascara, my eyes swelled up. I thought it was an allergy to something else (dust? mold? stress?) so I continued to use the product on and off. It took me a week to figure out it was really the mascara. Itchy, swollen eyes -- this product ruined my holidays.After googling the product, I see that I'm not the only one with this issue -- which leads me to the question: why is this product still available for sale?After this, I've advised anyone and everyone (doctors, girls at Sephora, friends) to avoid Maybelline at all costs. Using the much pricier but eye-safe Diorshow Blackout mascara now. At least I don't have to worry about my face becoming a swollen mess again.Shame on you, Maybelline."
5,Maybelline,"Top rated mascara forever. Magazines and reviewers still choose this as a top buy. I don't use it, but my mother does and she loves it. She's tried all expensive brands and always ends up back with Maybelline."
1,SEVERE ALLERGIES,"I also had SEVERE allergies after using this makeup and I NEVER get sick or have allergies. It made my eyes swell, get puffy, dry, and itchy. It was so bad, I will have gone to the doctor 4 times because of it. No makeup for 10 days to clear it. NEVER buy this ever. Horrible chemicals inside."
1,EVIL!,This is one of the most evil things ever brought into existence! I look like Quasimodo my eyes are so swollen.
2,Burned my eyes,"I bought this because of all the great reviews in magazines and on t.v., naming this as the best mascara on the market. I have never been allergic to a cosmetic but this product burned my eyes every time I used it and accidentally got a little bit inside the lid. The brush is small (some may like that, some may not) and it is not the slightest bit clumpy (excellent) but the reaction I had to it outweighed the positives and I returned it and got my money back."
1,My Eyes are SWOLLEN!!!,"Do not buy this, especially if you have a special occasion coming soon. It's 3 days before Christmas! I never get allergic reactions to anything and this Maybelline Great Lash Mascara Blackest Black made both of my eyes itch and my left eye is so swollen I can barely see out of it!!! I'm embarrased I've had to come to work like this for the last 3 days!!!!~fustrated and disappointed!! that's right girls ""DON'T BUY THIS ONE!!!"" Tell your friends and family!"
2,After Exile...,"Other than the hot track ""Slave"" and the 2 hits, very forgettable. Get Let It Bleed and hear what the Rollings Stones are all about..."
5,The Stones last great album,"Mick and Keith managed to have a little revival in the late seventies and early eighties. Some Girls started the revival, and Tattoo You continued it (Never mind Emotional Rescue). This album of course has the smash hits: ""Start Me Up"", ""Little T & A"", ""Hang Fire"" but the other tracks here are awesome also. ""Neighbors"" is just good rock and roll. ""Tops"" is just Mick showing a little sense of humor and style. A must purchase to hear the boys last hurrah before they turned into a lounge act."
2,Odds & Sods,"The Stones delve into their archives for songs recorded early in the 70s. Some succeed (Start Me Up) and more often, they do not. In the late 60s and early 70s, new Rolling Stones releases were important. By this point in time, this was no longer the case."
4,"Great, But Not The Best","When I borrowed several Stones CD's from my uncle, I found myself listening to less-praised albums like Emotional Rescue rather than Tattoo You. But now, I'm starting to grow a bit more attatched to it. ""Start Me Up"" and ""Waiting on a Friend' are two of the Stones' best songs ever. ""Heaven,"" ""No Use in Crying,"" and ""Worried About You"" are all wonderful ballads. ""Little T&A,"" ""Hang Fire,"" and ""Neighbours"" rock out. Definitely in my Top 10 Stones albums, but not as great, by far, as Exile or even IORR."
4,Good Stuff,"The record scores an Almost Great, lose the silly ""Neighbors"" and replace ""Black Limousine"" with a ballsier blues number and the scale would tip. This is the last notable record of a great rock and roll band - not coincidentally it came before the massive stadium spectacles and commercialism made them a band who knew they no longer had to work to survive. Typically, their creative output since has been an insult.In its best moments - Tattoo You echoes the vitality of ""Exile on Main Street"" - the best Rolling Stones record of the 1970s, and ""Sticky Fingers"". ""Slave"" rocks a la ""Can't You Hear Me Knocking"", ""Heaven"" is underrated, and the rest is mostly exciting and subversive also.I'm writing a review for this 23 year old record because listening to it for the first time in years feels damn good.In this era when ""Jumpin Jack Flash"" is a marketing tool for Chevrolet and Mick Jagger is a Knight for chrissakes, there aint much but the old stuff to get yer ya yas out about."
3,Really A Collection,"Yes it's probably their last important release, but consider this; most of the material was recorded a few years prior to this release making it almost like an outtake anthology from the mid-70's. I believe only 4 or 5 cuts were actually new songs that they recorded at this time. The rest date from the Black And Blue, Some Girls, and Emotional Rescue sessions. So in reality, Some Girls in my opinion was their last ""great"" album. Still some fine stuff here and I still need to buy a copy."
5,Excellent,"Great CD by the Rolling Stones that can stand up to any of the CDs from the classic period. Of course, as we all know, the Stones would never even come close to the quality of this album after its release. Splitting it up into rockers and ballads was an excellent decision and gives the CD a unique pacing. Some of the songs aren't anything spectacular by themselves, but when placed in the context of ""Tattoo You"" make perfect sense (for instance, the atmospheric ""Heaven"" and the meandering jam ""Slave"")."
4,Interesting hodgepodge,"Tracks from as far back as the Mick Taylor era (that's partially why there are no player credits) the idea of an album of Stones ""also rans"" makes one shudder... remember METAMORPHISIS? However, this is a very good, cohesive album. Okay, there's a couple of songs on the second side that could have stayed lost. Still worthy, even if it does have the overplayed ""Start Me Up,"" becuase it has Keith's ""Little T&A."""
3,a good stones album with Start me up.,"I'm not a Stones fan...I just like this album and Some Girls.Tattoo you is good and has one of their best songs in Start me up. Get it, but avoid the albums A BIGGER BANG, and OUT OF OUR HEADS albums which suck big time."
1,Dear oh dear,"The Stones as a rule don't release strong overall albums; even in the early 70's, their best period, you had to dig the gems out of a lot of dross. 'Tattoo You' conforms to the general rule. It has two good songs - the first, 'Start Me Up', and the last, 'Waiting on a Friend' - and very little of substance in between. Fine if you're a completist; if not, just buy 'Hot Rocks' or maybe 'Exile', their only album that works as a cohesive whole."
3,It's GOOD!,"This is a very good album. The Stones of the 60's and early 70's would have been proudTattoo You has a classic song in Start Me Up, several AWESOME songs like Neighbors, Hang Fire, Waiting On a Friend. Not a bad song on this album.I gave it 4 stars but I accidentally hit 3. SorryIT DESERVES 4-5 stars though."
2,OVERRATED,"THE ROLLING STONES ARE CLEARLY THE MOST OVERRATED BAND OF ALL TIMES. Only that can explain that an album with the ridiculous ""HANG FIRE"" be considered a ""masterpiece"". Anyway, among the various low-class releases they put ou in the eighties, this TATTOO YOU is really something good."
2,Squished,"This is my first experience with the 2009 remastered reissues of Stone discs, but it seems to suffer the same as reviews I have read about the other albums. The music has been compressed to make it louder and more ""modern"" sounding. The new version IS louder and more ""modern"" sounding, so they succeeded in that sense. They failed in the sense that the music now sounds squished together. The original version was much more interesting to listen to with it's ""sparser"" mix.The version of Slave is the unedited version, which is interesting to hear, but ultimately not as satisfying as the original issue.It is still the Stones and still one of my all time favorite albums, but I am not going to get rid of my original copy. If you want this disc, go and find an original issue."
2,Overrated,"The common critical line is that ""Tattoo You"" is a comeback from the Stones' mid-70's decline and their last great studio album. Simply put-pure unadulterated bunk. Apart from the classic (if overplayed) ""Start Me Up"", the lovely ""Waiting on a Friend"", and the churning funk of ""Slave,"" this is a collection of Stones-by-numbers, songs where the band is merely going through the motions. (As a side note, isn't it interesting that the best songs on the record date from their supposed mid-70's ""dreck"" period, yet the newer tracks are filler?) It's inconceivable that anyone could consider such babble as ""Little T&A"" or ""Neighbors"" classics, especially when compared to underrated earlier tracks like ""If You Can't Rock Me"" or ""Crazy Mama."" And the ballads are tepid one-dimensional MOR, especially shocking from a band capable of the beauty of ""Winter"" and ""Time Waits For No One."" Skip this overhyped mess and start with their 70's classics."
4,"Good, not Great Stones","Like many Xers, this is the album that introduced my generation to the music of the Stones. And as far as Stones albums go, this is an average outing. As far as the more recent albums go, this album ranks at the top of an average musical heap. That being said, there are some very solid tracks on here, even classics. Start me up is the obvious one, but it's the other gems like T&A, Tops, and Waiting on a Friend that keep this album alive as a whole. This is the album that probably marks the line of demarcation between the old and the new Stones sound. It was considered their comeback album after a long hiatus, and it didn't dissappoint the legions of fans and critics alike."
4,My opinion,"Not only one song is good, but most of them. But not all, that whay four stars and not five.Sound could be beter, I realy like sound on my LP."
3,Get it when cheap!,"A good album, I have it on vinyl,but not the best Stones album but better than many of them. I bought it because I wanted it in digital format and Amazon had marked the price way down for the MP3 download. Get it, but get it when it is marked way down."
5,Pure SACD,"a DEMO quality SACD. Excellent crystal clear sound, nice tight bass, reberbs as good as they can sound. Even when the remastered cd version has a very good sound, this japanese SHM SACD is noticeable better. Important: no 5.1, no compatibility with regular cd players. And the price, well... Universal is abusing our pockets."
3,Another False Start,"Like ""Some Girls"", ""Tattoo You"" was widely hailed by critics as ""their best since 'Exile on Main Street.'"" I couldn't understand why. In fact I was so disappointed in this album that I didn't bother to see the Stones when they came to town. Those of us who grew up on the classic Stones were mystified as to why a throwaway song like ""Start Me Up"" was so wildly popular.Almost 20 years later, I still don't care for ""Start Me Up"", and ""Neighbors"" gets my vote for worst Stones song ever. ""Hang Fire"" and ""Slave"" are fairly pointless. ""Little T & A"" is funny (at least Keith isn't singing one of his ballads); and ""Black Limousine"" is a tolerable blues.The second side has improved steadily over the years, and ""Waiting on a Friend"" is the one true gem on this album.Fortunately the Stones would FINALLY make another great record --- in 1983 ""Undercover"" was released and the stale, ""sucking in the 70s"" were behind them. The great decline stopped with ""Tattoo You."""
4,Do u REALLY love the stones?,"I never liked the stones. My wife likes the stones. I've had them driven down my throat! But whatever you might say, this album rocks, it's blue and Sonny Rollins plays here. Sonny-friggin'-Rollins! Hear the music and not the critics!"
2,Overrated,"I like to keep my reviews short and to the point. Tattoo You isn't a bad album, but it ranks no where near their best. I hate to say it, but I find Tattoo You boring. However, even a mediocre Stones album is still worth a listen. If you wanted a criminally underrated Stones album, tryGoats Head Soup"
3,Entertaining First Novel,"Nice debut, with a soft Austen underbelly in the voice that's fun to read. Not as good as reviewers claim, of course, because these literary debuts hardly ever are, but a writer to watch out for. Worth reading."
2,Doggy,"Want to know how to see whether this is a winner? Check how many used ones are available, and at what price. As I write this ther are 24, starting at $... Clearly, the market says this CD is not among his best. And I agree. Weak, limp, flaccid, dull, and boring.Leo Kottke has recorded two of the finest CDs I own. And he has many other lovely ones. But this is a shame. I found it after hearing nothing new in many years, and regretted both the purchase and the knowledge. What a step down. What a decline from absolute greatness. Like the once feared hitter who's lost a half-second, it is painful to listen to after such beauty, joy and majesty."
1,Not one of Leo's best,"I've been enjoying Leo's music for years. This one was truly awful. If you want to hear Leo at his best, try ""My Feet are Smiling"" or his 1976 greatest hits LP, ""Did You Hear That?"""
5,Ripping Lead Guitar ?,"This album gets 5 stars just for the guitar lead in COLDWATER CANYON, it is unlike most of the other 9 TD albums I own where I dont hear much obvious guitar. The entire album makes a great short concert. Highly recommended if you love complicated trippy space music. You wont believe its just 3 guys making all that wild sound!"
4,Most informative of the sinus books,This is a well written book with a wealth of information. I would have given it 5 stars if the authors had talked about intermittant nasal congestion that produces no mucus. I have yet to find a sinus book that does.
2,Don't bother,"This isn't the worst book on sinus infections I've ever encountered. However, it does not hold a candle to Sinus Survival (Ivker), and in fact, when compared, seems wholly inadequate. Don't waste your health here."
2,useless book.,There are other books far better and more useful than this book. for that matter all the information in this book is available on the web.
4,No real revelations...,"This is a good book if you know nothing at all about your sinus condition. However, I had already gathered much of this information from good websites. There were a couple of interesting things that I wasn't aware of, but the bottom line is, how is this going to help me? Is it going to give me new ideas so I can get better? Unfortunately, it didn't. If you've already tried nasal irrigations, decongestants, steroid sprays, antihistamines, possible allergy shots and antibiotics, then you know all you can know about treating sinusitis without surgery. If you are facing surgery, then maybe the chapters on what to expect will be useful."
5,One of the better self-help medical books,"Authoritative information, well organized, easy to understand. If you have sinus problems, this book should help you both with prevention and treatment. It includes natural non-medicinal treatments. I think it would be helpful to non-sinus sufffers also. Read it if you want to take care of your own body."
4,Another Fine Glucerna Product for Diabetics,"The similar Kellogg's products are only slightly lower in total carbohydrates than Glucerna's. More importantly, one must evaluate how those carbs affect diabetics. I cannot determine for anyone else, what their glucose response is; however, for me, the initial glucose spike from Kellogg's product was significantly higher--nearly double--that for Glucerna's over the next three hours.I suggest that all diabetics do similar tests before you settle on any cereal, including Glucerna's."
1,Would not recommend,"I got a coupon for this and tried it. In my opinion, Kellog's Fruit Harvest is a much better option (half the cost at my store, much better taste and consistency, lower in net carbs, and way more strawberries). I was glad I got this for free, so I did not feel so bad separating out the few strawberries and throwing out the rest after trying it twice."
4,II IS Good not Great,"The sophmore effort by The Atomic Bitchwax at first listen doesn't appear to be a strong as the first release, but I'm sure it will grow with each listen.There are some high points Forty-Five and the spaced out Solid. No surprises here just great Stoner Rock. So if your tastes include Kyuss, Nebula, and Fu Manchu then by all means pick this up."
3,"""Solid"" rock.","It's really hard not to like a band called The Atomic Bitchwax, who also has some of the best album covers in history. Oh, and this disc will rock your socks off as well. ""Atomic Bitchwax II"" is like a 45 minute buzz. I like it more than ""Spit Blood"", though they're roughly the same stuff. Picking a favorite track would be hard, but ""Smokescreen"" is awesome, and hey, lyrics are overrated anyway. ""The Cloning Chamber"" is a trip too. I hesitate to say this band is better than Kyuss or Monster Magnet, but it is the next best thing."
2,What Happened To The Solo's?!?,"The First atomic album was amazing, quite litterally the best album i've ever heard, and i had high hopes for this one as well, but i was failed.... what happened to the solo's that made the first album so great? The solo's set them apart from all of the other rock bands in their genere, hopefull they'll figure this out and do more in the next album"
2,HID COOL HID Kit,The kit arived within 10 days. Got it installed the next weekend with no problems. Everything was plug and play. Here is where the problems started. The kit works but the balasts are garbage. They don't fire up most of the times. You have to turn the lights on and off a few times to get them going. I would not buy from this company again.I am trying to find out who to contact about the waranty. The lights were shipped to me from China.
4,POWERFUL LITTLE MACHINE,"This machine is incredible. It performs really well. Hands down a great buy. Have not had any problems and the machine works well, purchased it about 3 weeks ago. It was easy to configure my wireless, loaded all my app's and I was good to go. Overall a good little system. I see this brand showing up all over the place these days...If you are looking for a thin and light this is a great buy."
3,short distance wifi,I liked the look and feel of this computer overall. What I did not like was that the range of the wifi(802.11b) was not long enough. I like to work in front of the TV which is on the first floor and my router is on the 2nd floor. I could not do this with the 3150HD. Am able to do this with 2 other laptops that I use. The range of the wifi on the 3150HD was less than 1/2 the distance other computers that I use.I was unable to get any help from Averatec on this issue. I returned to buy.com and got a full refund.
5,Great laptop,"I got this right here at Amazon auctions for $550.00 new, a great price. A great notebook. I think I'll upgrade the ram to 512 MB. Their tech support was excellent. I had to call twice with questions (nothing serious) and I got thru right away"
2,NEVER AGAIN,I bought several of 3150P.exact 50% of them had defective speaker.DVD drives on 100% of them do not read recordedDVDs that ALL TOSHIBA and SONY laptops read NO SWEAT.Keyboard virtually popped out in 1 of them despite hardlyany use. NEVER MORE will I buy a good looking shoddy quality laptop like this. I wish we had returned them all in30 days instead of being enchanted with their GREAT LOOK and keeping them. The quality fo service is FAR fromthat offered by HP. They will not even bother to pick up the stuff in Fremont where they in theory assemble them.
1,*Shakes head*,This is one listing i have a lot latly and its brutal as ever all in one cd with gorey lirics and incrdible musisisans behind its brutal sound. Recommnded for fasn of extermre gory and burtal music!!!^An average sentence from the people who like this crap^
2,ONE OF STONE`S WORST EFFORTS,Very bad recording. Just another bunch of songs put together to sell based on the great fame of the band. Only for the die-hard fan.
4,A fine effort,"I loved this recording 30 years ago and I love it now. No big comeback, no big statments, just a rock solid effort full of good, great and interesting songs. It is the Rolling Stones as I like to remember them. What is considered by some to be a throwaway effort would be a crowning achievement for most bands. Don't belive the bad reviews. Like Exile it takes several listenings to kick in, but when it does it wears very well. Where the Boys All Go and Dance Pt.1 are gems that never got the acclaim they deserve."
3,"Good music, badly mastered","Nice collection of songs. Sounds to me like the limiter was pushed way too hard in the mastering. All the harder hits on the high-hat in the title track (and there's a lot of those) go ""crunch"" in the high end, which rather takes away from the pleasure of the song for me. I am going to look for a vinyl copy at my local record store, or a pre-loudness war CD version (if there is one), maybe the sound quality will be better."
3,Recycled Stones,"Hey...it's a long career, okay? This is an album with more good than bad and with some great moments most don't know about. The first half features a lot of good stuff that doesn't get much play and the curious blues number ""Down In The Hole"" is really well done. Keith's requisite number ""All About You"" is a comical kiss off to Anita with adaptable lyrics for any occassion. The title track is ""Miss You"" without soul, but the album as a whole is mostly good fun but not essential."
4,Froth & Bubble,"I'm not sure if it makes any difference, but I have the digitally re-mastered CD and it sounds really good. Maybe the people who don't like this record prefer the murky sound of their earlier stuff. Granted, most of it is fairly lightweight.There's some silly songs on this record like Indian Girl but I think it's diverse, playful and has probably the most instantly appealing (ie radio friendly) group of songs of any Stones album in Send It To Me, Emotional Rescue, She's So Cold, Let Me Go and Where The Boys Go. Did it get played on the radio? I'm too young to remember ...."
4,'She's So Cold' possibly their greatest song,"The Some Girls' 1977 ethic of 'let's record as many songs as we can before Keith's sent upriver' kept the Stones in songs for several albums, including this one, and the patchiness of strung-together outtakes does show, but 'S.S.C.' sums up the drive, looseness, and humor of the Stones at their best. Buy this album just for that track (though note Franz Ferdinand's ""Take Me Out"" sounds suspiciously like Rescue's first song, ""Dance, pt.1."" Even treading water, Mick and co. laid out the future)."
3,Oh so Mediocre,"This was one of the first Stones albums I ever bought. Whereas I liked it upon the first few lsitens, it just lacked the staying power to become more memorable about 20 years later and 20 Stones records purchased. There are some good songs(Let Me Go, Down In The Hole, Summer Romance). However, even the aforementioned best songs just do not compare with the Stones best material of the late sixties early seventies. Heck it wouldn't even compare to their better works from other eras including the most recent studio release, Bridges To Babylon. The effort just sounds a bit tired and a 2 1/2 star grade is what it gets. I round to three because its the Stones man."
2,Extension Of Some Girls?,Just let the tapes run on and on and maybe something good will come of it? This is a big letdown from what they achieved with Some Girls and it feels as if a lot of the earlier momentum that the group had has been lost.
3,This Album Doesn't get Enough Credit? Come On...,"I consider myself a huge Stones fan and I purchased this LP when it first came out in 1980. I was dissapointed then and I still think it is a somewhat weak album from the Stones. While I will admit it is marginally better than Tattoo You, it is very weak next to Some Girls. Really, giving it 5 stars to prove a point that it is underrated is wrong because it is just about a 3 star album. Save your five stars for Sticky Fingers, Some Girls and Let It Bleed. From the Brian Jones era I recommend Aftermath, Between The Buttons. THESE are all five stars, not this lackluster effort."
3,Kind of a mishmash,"I would hope that most people buying this album already have the best of the band, namely Exile on Main Street, Sticky Fingers, Beggar's Banquet, etc. This album is a mishmash, and while there are songs I really like, it is more of an outtake album than a coherent project. I always viewed this album as pure product, coupled with the resurgence the Stones went thru after Some Girls, an album they knew would sell merely because it was a Stones album. All About You, She's So Cold, are good songs. Despite the title the rest need emotion to rescue it."
4,Just As Great As Some Girls,"I can't understand why some people dislike this one. I heard one person say it sounded like a ""disco sampler."" In reality, only two of the tracks could be called ""disco,"" for lack of another title: ""Dance"" and ""Emotional Rescue,"" which are both excellent tracks. (""Keith! Whatcha - whatcha doin'!?"") The other tracks are a good mix of rock and ballads. ""Where the Boys Go"" is a sneering jibe at punk bands like the Clash and the Sex Pistols. ""Summer Romance"" and ""Let Me Go"" rock out, as well. Keith's ballad ""All About You"" is perhaps the best of the bunch, becuase it's a song most of us can relate to. ""How come I'm still in love with you?"" Brilliant! Emotional Rescue is like an extension of Some Girls, and comes close to surpassing it. Worth the money all the way."
3,Ok but some good tracks that makes it a worth listen.,"Emotional Rescue follows the same as Some Girls but I think the tracks are songs that are not taken seriously and not written much but they were written well. The album is mostly dance numbers and some rockers. I really liked ""She's So Cold"" with the guitar and bass riffs. Overall, it is a good album but it is a bunch of leftover material that never gets anywhere."
3,not the best,What do you expect for that time in music history. Rolling Stones fans can overlook all the faults of the era.
4,another Stones 70s classic,"Perhaps not one the ""most classic"" Stones albums, but the 1980 release is another outstanding album. The title track is one of my all time favorites. Other highlights include Let Me Go and She's So Cold."
2,"Sorry, But...","I will admit I like ""Let Me Go"" and ""She's So Cold"", but the rest of the album, to me, is mediocre. The Stones are still a great band- they just put out a bad album this time."
3,Not Their Strongest,"This album has several good cuts on it, the most well known being ""She's So Cold""; but on a ranked list of Stones releases, the guys themselves rank this one closer to the bottom than the top. We'd advise sticking with the classics starting with ""Let It Bleed"", ""Sticky Fingers"", and ""Exile On Main Street"". Nevertheless, a lot better than some of the filler on the White Album or ""Let It Be"", for example. 3-Stars."
2,P.S.,"I think McCartney's ""Goodnight Tonight"" is better than ""Dance (Part 1)"", Harrison's ""All Those Years Ago"" is better than ""All About You"", Lennon's ""Starting Over"" is better than ""Indian Girl"" and Ringo Starr's ""It Don't Come Easy"" is better than ""Where the Boys Go""."
1,AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS,"HOW DOES THE SAME BAND THAT GAVE US SATISFACTION,GIMMIE SHELTER, AND PAINT IT BLACK-GIVE US THIS TRAIN WRECK OF A ALBUM? RESCUE HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE WORST SONGS EVER,AND IT'S THE TITLE TRACK! AND THE REST IS WORSE!GUYS,GUYS,GUYS, IF THE PARTYS OVER,GET OFF THE STAGE!"
1,Contrived,"Contrived, convoluted, mechanical, etc. These guys went through the motions on this one. It sounds like it was recorded in a day. What an effort."
3,"Good, not great","The Stones, mostly due to longevity are a band with three levels of albums: CLASSIC, GREAT and MEARLY GOOD. You all know the Classics (BEGGARS BANQUET, LET IT BLEED, STICKY FINGERS AND EXILE), the greats are all up for debate (SOME GIRLS, TATTOO YOU, BETWEEN THE BUTTONS) and the Stones Mearly Good are what some bands try their whole career to reach.EMOTIONAL RESCUE falls in the Mearly Good catagory for me. It has some really good songs ""All About You"", ""She's So Cold"", ""Where the Boys Go"", ""Down In A Hole"", and ""Let Me Go"", (so a side's worth) but the other five are immenently forgettable. Well ""Emotional Rescue"" is not forgettable, but laughable with that ""I will be your knight in shining armor coming to your emotional rescue..."" Do you think Keith even PLAYED on that?"
4,Definite Departure...,"In My Time is a definite departure from the usual fare that I've come to expect from Yanni. Abandoning the electronic sound of synthesizers, he has chosen to soften his musical approach by giving it a more orchestral feel. The predominance of piano and violin throughout this recording is a very soothing and relaxing change of pace for the admitted king of New Age music. His experimentation with style may alienate some fans who prefer the more modern sound of his earlier recordings; however, for this listener, the experiment is a smashing success."
1,boooo,"i have heard this guys ""music"" ,as some would call it, from my mother,and i listened to the audio samples........its really worthless,if your into a mellow moody music try miles davis,or van morrison...... yanni makes me cry...... tears of shame."
5,Best of the Best,"I would say, ""The Best"" Yanni Album Ever!! If Live at the Acropolis was a masterpiece, this is something like... I don't know what to say. Its just awesome. Each Song. Each Song is better than the previous and I could just listen to it every day and still want more.If you are a Yanni fan, Just go for it, you'll never regret."
4,Nice Dogs,"If your bench-top is any thicker than 3"" you will be unable to use the small side of the dog rendering them useless for hand planing. I ended up chopping off the large section on two of these dogs so I could slide them all the way thru the dog holes and found that there is very little metal in their centers - doesn't seem to make a difference as far as use is concerned. It should also be noted that these dogs have fairly drastic teeth which grip very well but can mar soft lumber easily. Though these work well I prefer aluminum or brass dogs."
1,The canon people must be idiots,"I can't believe how hard of a time I've had this my canon printer. (Which I have now replace with a sweet Brother laser printer!)The chips that are in the ink cartridges seem to keep failing, making 90% full ink tanks say they are empty. Its a horrible design and shouldn't have been put on to the market.Avoid this product."
2,too expensive,"This book has been highly touted, but does not live up to its hype. Any number of books are as interesting, and much cheaper. ""A History of Aircraft Piston Engines"" (Smith) comes to mind, as well as many of the books by Bill Gunston. Don't buy this book without seeing it first. For the same money you can get two or three other books that will together contain much more information. However, it is a very good one-volume source on the subject."
3,HP Pavilion DV9640 us Review,"Machine used at work. Great Computer. It is extremely powerful and is almost perfect for my needs. The screen and the graphics are truly top of the line. On the downside, The funtion keys letter size are very small. The left side of the Keyboard get very hot when on."
2,Not what you think!,"Product was shipped to me broken, had to ship to HP within 24 hours of receiving product. Was mislead about it being new computer, when in fact it was a refurbished computer. Company returns e-mails in timely manner. Was compensated for being over charged."
3,Where's Bette????,"I was a little disappointed with this one; I watched this movie thinking it was a Bette Davis Feature, since Bette's image and name is all over this product, But Bette is only in the first few scenes, the rest of the movie focus on Margaret Lindsay's character as she tries to find out what happened to her step sister (played by Bette). Even with my disappointment I found to my surprise that I liked this movie. The story and the fast paced way it's told keeps this movie fresh and interesting from beginning to end. I'd recommend this to any Classic movie fans into Crime dramas and who done it Mysteries."
5,Hands on turnaround,"Excellent reading. Chanda's ability to draw lessons from corporate happenings around us makes this book different from the usual management tomes. His simple writing style coupled with lucid thinking makes it not only highly readable but a hands on guide to turn around corporates. He achieves what he sets out to do - tell you how creative thinking can make any asset yield much more than its face value. If your asset (company) is in or heading towards the dumps, order this book and be saved."
2,Bear Island VHS tape,"The tape appears like new but the image ""bounces"" in my VHS player, making the image impossible to watch. Other tapes in my player do not bounce."
3,Bear Island,"An intense thriller set on an island in the frozen Arctic. Scientists come to study the island while others are there to find Nazi gold hidden in an old German U-boat den. Who is who is the puzzle. When the Nazi gold horde is discovered, who will survive the lust is almost the bigger puzzle. It is a shame that this movie has not been released on DVD."
1,Aria is missing,"While I just received the book and haven't gotten a chance to really check it out, I did go to ""O mio babbino caro"" from Gianni Schicchi (which was the major reason I ordered this collection) and IT WAS MISSING. Page 88 was really Page 90 printed twice. It was disheartening since I've been looking forward to getting it. What are the chances the ONE aria I really wanted was messed up?!! I dont' know if there are any other misprints.I have emailed the published but have yet to get a response. Until I do, my 1 star will remain."
5,Truly practical for astronomers,"I'm a professional astronomer (remaining anonymous out of shame for my lack of statistical knowledge). I have found this book immensely useful in my data analysis and very straightforward. It is geared toward astronomical research, so is likely not as useful or illuminating for those unfamiliar with our data analysis. The explanations are straightforward and written in a pleasant tone (e.g., the reassuring ""That's it."" concluding the algorithm for bootstrapping).If you are involved in professional astronomical research, this is truly practical statistics for you. If you are just casually interested in astronomy or are in another discipline and just want to learn statistics, I'd suggest passing this book by."
5,Good,"I do agree with Jorge Salles' review. I know him personally, and he is a man with excellent taste in music."
4,GOOD BUT LIMITED,"THIS PROJECT IS A GOOD CD ""MUSIC-WISE"", BUT I SEE A HUGE FLAW THAT NO ONE HAS EVER MENTIONED.BRASIL PROJECT No. 1 WAS FORMED WITH SEVERAL FAMOUS BRAZILIAN JAZZ SONGWRITERS, AND TOOTS HAPPENED TO INVITE THEM AGAIN FOR PROJECT No.2 LEAVING OUT MANY OTHER FANTASTIC BRAZILIAN JAZZ SONGWRITERS LIKE: TANIA MARIA / JOAO DONATO / MANFREDO FEST / MARCOS VALLE / AZYMUTH / ROBERTO MENESCAL / RIQUE PANTOJA / JOYCE / MARCOS ARIEL / MARCOS SILVA ETC. ETC. THEREFORE, I DON'T THINK THIS PROJECT DESERVES THE 5 STARS.GOOD MUSIC, BAD SELECTION OF PARTICIPANTS."
4,More In-Depth than the text book!,"Meant as a companion to the two-volume textbook set, this workbook has tons of questions and answers which build upon your textbook readings. My instructors pulled several questions for each exam from this workbook, which were always tougher than the test bank questions. A must buy if your class uses the companion textbooks."
3,Adequate,Does its job holding flag in place at idle speeds but slips on the lightmast at faster speeds. Duct tape may prevent this from happening or a small screw inserted to hold it in place. Be careful not to cut wiring for the light.
3,lead is fine,"The lead is fine, the clip works great. I should have gotten a shorter length as there is a LOT of extra to hold in my hand. My dog doesn't work great off of this lead, but it's nice to have on hand as an extra."
4,Working on the Railroad,"Great information on daily operations of a Railroad. The Author uses past and present pictures to explain he's point across. I wish he just stayed current. He's explain each occupation of the R.R. from the basis brakeman 101 to the engineer. As we know must of this job were eliminated as we come to new technology era. Overall, its a great book to understand the past but if you are looking current technology. It's not there."
2,Seriously Disappointed,"I was seriously disappointed in this book. It covers a lot of information, but the sample questions and material do not come close to the real test or way questions are asked on the real certification test."
3,Should not be your only source,The good news is book was well laid out with easy to understand information. The bad news is the typos and the incorrect test answers on the CD. I had to abandon this book and rely on the SHRM learning system as the incorrect answers on the CD test were compromising my learning. Accurate information is a key essential to passing the SPHR and if you are not well versed in HR this book and primarily the CD could compromise your ability to pass the test. I would only recommend this book to someone who was using it as a supplemental study guide or someone who knows HR inside and out.
1,Not Much Help!,"I used this book alone to study for the Dec. 2007 SPHR test. It was a waste of time! This book, along with the CD and practice test, did NOT represent what was on the test. Many of the subjects in this book were not even on the test.I did not pass the test and was extremely upset when most of the questions on the actual exam were subjective. The questions, barring any legalities, left too much room for personal opinion. I am not sure how anyone can study for that! For example, ""what is the MOST effective way to handle this situation"". This book focuses on lots of court cases, but there were none on the exam!I was very disappointed in this book and will not be using it to study for the next attempt at the exam."
2,Missing Chapter and A Lot of Typos,"I am scheduled to take the test in Jan. 2010 and am using this book as a supplement to other study materials. It does have a lot of information, but the typos are a bit annoying. In addition, over 30 pages of the Total Rewards chapter is missing... from the first page of the chapter and 31 pages after that. If I didn't have other resources to draw from I would have been royally messed up. This is really a situation of ""buyer beware""... know what you are getting before buying."
2,"Full of typos and errors, Use SHRM learning system instead","Way too many typos and errors to even take this text seriously. Although the SHRM Learning System is expensive, it is totally worth it to help you pass the test since the information presented and practice questions closely resemble the actual test. Make sure you purchase the practice assessments from HRCI, too. This text should be used only as a supplement and only if you are interested in learning more about particular court cases. I passed the SPHR exam on the first try in 2008 using primarily the SHRM Learning System. I stopped using this text shortly after receiving it when I realized its quality was not up to par."
3,Good Resource but,"The book comes with a CD but unfortunately it requires you to download it onto the computer so i can not use/ study while at work- (breaks, lunch)."
5,Great Purchase,"This book was my sole study resource in preperation for taking the SPHR certification examination. My recommendation is that you study, take the prep tests (included on the CD), study the weakest area indicated by results, test again and repeat till you're sick of it. The SPHR test will focus on theory and therefore is a hard study.P.S., I passed my SPHR exam and owe it all to experience and this book."
1,Do not buy this book,"If you want to prepare for the actual SPHR Exam, do not buy this study guide. This guide is a nice book to give you knowledge on HR history and practices but it either is not current or the folks at SHRM have read his book and created questions designed to push their own prep products.I used this book for the exam and took the actual practice assessment two days before the exam and copied the questions down to look up in his book and not one answer could be located in this textbook.I would recommend using a SHRM-Sponsored product over this one if you want to be prepared for the ACTUAL Exam. You will be fooled if you take his practice questions in the book and think you will do well, because the testing material is totally different."
1,Don't be misled!,"This book is a sham. It boasts that if one is able to complete the provided study exams consistently in the 90 percentile they will be fully prepared for the SPHR exam. NOT TRUE. NOT TRUE. NOT TRUE.The study and exam prep questions provided are not structured as those on the actual exam and do not encompass all the areas of knowledge required to successfully pass the exam. I studied diligently (using this book) for two months, was able to pass the exams repeatedly at 96%-98% and FAILED the SPHR exam. Upon completion of the exam I was not able to find information relating to many of the exam questions in the entire book. 'SPHR Exam Prep' was a waste of my valuable time and money; don't be misled!"
1,Very Disappointing,"We purchased the book over a month ago for this test that my wife will take in January. Until now, we still have not received it yet. We are not making a fuss. We will know better next time."
5,SPHR Certification Must,"The ""SPHR Exam Prep"" is indispensable in preparing for the SPHR exam. Past study materials have not differentiated between PHR and SPHR competencies making preparation for the exam more difficult. Dr. Phillips recognized the need to separate the elements and focused on the advanced competencies associated with the senior professional's role in Human Resources.In addition to the advanced material, the guide contains Exam Alerts which are designed to spotlight the salient points of each section. The review exercises are a critical component in testing understanding of the material followed by an extensive bank of test questions including a full practice exam.I found the ""SPHR Exam Prep"" invaluable in preparing for and passing my own SPHR exam. If you desire a resource that ensures full exam preparation, I highly recommend Dr. Phillip's book."
2,Not enough detail,"I have to agree with many of the other reviews. This book provides a good summary of information, but the SHRM Learning system provides more relevant detail and is easier to understand. I did pass the SPHR, but I stopped using this book and focused primarily on the SHRM Learning System. I doubt I could have passed the test if this was my only resource. It's an inexpensive buy as a supplement, but don't depend on this to pass the exam!!"
3,Not that color in real life,"This shirt is just okay. The delivery was great, no problems with the transaction. But, it is not that exact color, it's actually a darker blue a typical ""less expensive"" looking tarheel shirt. I could have just bought that for 5 dollars at the school store, or gotten it for free at a game. Somewhat disappointing but not the worst I guess."
5,UNIQUELY DELICIOUS,THIS PRODUCT IS ABSOLUTELY LOVELY. HAS A DISTINCLY DIFFERENT SWEET/TART TASTE---SOMEWHAT SIMILAR IN TASTE TO A PEAR OR APPLE WITH A CITRUS UNDERTONE---VERY PLEASING---BEAUTIFUL WITH A CHEESE AND FRESH FRUIT PLATTER---OR JUST TO SPREAD ON YOUR MORNING TOAST.
3,in-depth!,"I am in graduate school and read this for class--while I think it's interesting, I think it's a difficult read unless you're actively teaching. Read it if you find yourself teaching Basic Writing (BW) students, are interested in learning more about the social aspects of BW students (i.e. how the lower echelon of students feel about its treatment vs. those students in higher tracks) or the psychology of the student in general. If you are going to use it, it might be best to focus initially on what you are strongest in, i.e. syntax, grammar, spelling. While overall I found it interesting in theory, it was a difficult read and hard to grab practical information from it."
2,Errors and Expectations,"I am a tutor, and needed a very basic teacher's guide. This fits the bill. At first glance, I doubted that is would be what I needed, but after reading it and using it the first time...I find it to be excellent.The exercises are very appropriate, and I copy them off for the work sheets.. I am well satisfied."
3,Does not work for Mesa Dual Rectifier 3 channel multi watt footswitch,Bought this hoping to save a few bucks but alas it didn't work out. This cable Does NOT work for Mesa Dual Rectifier 3 channel multi watt footswitch.. save some headaches and just order the over priced Mesa cable[...]
3,Quick & Easy Diabetic REcipes for One,"It seemed like a very good idea when I read the title on this book, but once I got it the one recipe idea is not so hot. When preparing a recipe only a small sum of an ingredient is used leaving a lot left over. I probably will not use this book."
4,Recipes for One,"As far as a book with smaller portions, it's okay. It's not really a book of recipes for just one cause most have more than one serving but it's a pretty good little book if you are looking to buy one. Haven't tried the recipes though"
1,not worth it,I didn't like the recipes and ended up keeping about 3 and throwing out the book! Nothing very interesting and some processed food
3,If you need a boost...,"My nutritionist told me about the cookbook Quick & Easy Diabetic Recipes for One."" The recipes don't make you feel like you need to eat more. They put in your mind that you have eaten enought for one meal, and that is what I like."
3,A good idea,"This book contains about 50 recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert that have low-cal, low-sodium, and low-fat themes. My biggest complaint about the book is the simplicity of some of the recipes--for instance: there is a recipe for a spread that you put on a bagel and the recipe says, take a knife and spread (that's not really a recipe). The dinner options are the best choices with everything from pasta dishes to stuffed peppers--treats I wouldn't have considered all that healthy before I got the book. The recipes are easy to read with the ingredients identified on the left and the exchange rates on the bottom. However, only a few of the recipes are actually for one--many are for two or four. In any case, a good choice for a beginning cook or a new diabetic."
2,Barely worth the price,"The box copy claims these films are ""Digitally Re-Mastered and Sound Enhanced."" This is not true.The films included do not appear to be available anywhere else on DVD, so they are fine if you just want to cross them off your life list. The audio and video quality is akin to watching old late night standard broadcast black and white movies on public access TV. In the rain."
4,Femme Fatales,"The product was fine, good picture and audio. My only problem is I had already seen two of the movies on another Femme Fatales collection. It was still worth buying"
3,"Good films, mediocre quality","The lacklustre quality on these DVDs can only be excused by the fact that most of the films are otherwise not easy to find. However, they should not claim that these have been remastered, when quite obviously they're just quick transfers from any print they were able to find. The fact that they misspelled ""femmes fatales"" on the cover further suggests that this is a product more or less thrown together for the quick buck, rather than a work of love for the fanatics.If you are looking for the films in this set, you will be fine--it's better than not being able to watch them at all. But don't expect any surprises."
2,Femme Fatales Collection,"The movies were great, but again the quality of the dvd's were not good. They would get stuck and would have to repeat trying to load several times."
3,you can do better,"Acceptable, but lacking in some ways. No controls for the sub woofer so you better have a equalizer to balance them out, and then they are still deficient in treble. On the other hand, if you like your music quite warm sounding you may like these. I give them a three because they are cheap. If the price was higher the rating would be lower. My advice, spend a little more and get better sounding speakers."
1,Sick people are boring too,"The privileged bores who people this slow-moving novel take forever to come a little bit alive on the page. White seems to think that giving a character HIV is enough to fascinate readers. It takes more than that. Set in Paris, this is SOOOOOO precious, it's extremely hard to relate to. I could barely make it to the end. And when I did I realized it hadn't been worth the trouble."
5,I loved the ending...,"What would we do without Edmund White? All of us who came of age in the seventies and survived. He is our chronicler. This is one of his best books so far. Although the story is quite singular and even ordinary, it resonates deeply with gay lives -- and their contradictions -- everywhere. I disagree with the other reviewers who feel the book is pretentious, and gets lost in its bicultural characters. It is a delicate, sad, wise, and hopeful book."
1,Not worth making it to the end--even if you could!,"Even if you are able to hack your way through Mr. White's slovenly prose, haphazard and random plotting, and hilarious pretentions to being a 'European' writer (this book is full of snide putdowns of American culture, but I guess the author's years abroad as an American in Paris entitle him to those, eh?)--why bother? The gay couple at the center of this book consists of two men so small-minded, self-involved, and unpersuasive that it's hard to imagine anyone caring what happens to them. White seems to think that by merely invoking the AIDS disaster, he can make this book be 'about' something; but I hope the gay community is beyond the point where we're supposed to be committed to a book or an author simply because it, or he, presses the right buttons. Judged as a literary work (as opposed to a poster for gay 'issues'), this is a total and inexcusable failure."
2,Men Behaving Badly,"While I enjoyed the author's excellent writing style, I at first thought he was attempting to show us a portrait of human beings ""warts and all,"" but as I came to the novel's end I concluded that despite his attempts to the contrary, Mr. White has given us a book peopled with ultimately unlikeable characters. My life experience has not been enriched by being introduced to the selfish, whiny Peter, the capricious and immature Julien, and the priggish, self-congratulatory Austin. Good riddance to The Married Man and all its characters!"
2,Boring and Sad,"I was surprised that I finished this book. Although the first Edmund White book I have read, I think it will be my last. The characters were so unlikable that I could hardly find one that I even cared about. I am about the age of Austin but my life has been far different. Much more full of meaning and less about sex with young selfish men."
2,no wonder gay guys get a bad wrap....,"this is a catch 22.... does ed write about the gay lifestyle because it truly is this way, or is his description fictional as well? the promiscuity, lack of personal direction, and lack of committment tell the world that (at least) austin can't seem to stay sober with one guy. he captures the differences between cultures in the u.s.a. and in france, excellently. france practices democracy and personal freedom, the u.s.a. does not. the story is a downer, although i do not hold that against the author--it is written well, i just have a problem with how the portrayal of adult gay life in this novel feeds the judgements by the ""religious right."" i'd rather they be proven wrong."
4,great quality,The table is of great quality. The size is perfect for children a little older than toddler age. Shipment was quick.
4,Pretty Good,"I bought these for my 02 chevy avalanche. they were shipped in a rs9000 box... i thought i was getting a deal but then opened it and found it to be the product i ordered. these rear shocks are pretty nice, got them installed eaisly, they feel pretty good. nice ride for a good price."
5,Wonderfully done!,"This is why I now purchase Yanni music. I saw Live on PBS. I usually turn tv concerts off, but this one caught my ear and it was captivating. I keep this CD at the top of my list! Would reccomend for anyone that loves good music!"
4,The Yanni fan maker.,"I wasn't much of a Yanni music fan before this CD and the video were released. The wife bought his prior works and I found them uninspiring, but this! This must be what the music sounded like in Yanni's head all these years. Wonderful orchestra, soaring violins, inspired solo performances. Even my rock-and-roll sister thought this was pretty good stuff. See the video to get the full measure of the performance (and see some numbers not included on the CD). Worth having in your collection."
5,A truly masterful artist.,"I have come to love Yanni's artistry since I first saw the PBS concert a number of years ago. Since then I have purchesed all of his works and can only implore to anyone considering this purchase to please do so!! Yanni can only be described as someone who can truly touch the soul. His compositions, arrangements and the artists he surrounds himself with reach out to you in ways that this writer finds nearly impossible to describe. ""LIVE"" is a great first CD to start your collection with as you will get a taste of the pure energy and emotion that is YANNI!!!"
5,A musical genius and his masterwork.,"Truly, this is an amazing album. Prior to this album, I was not even aware who this wondrous composer was. Now, I am convinced that Yanni is among this millenium's greatest musical influences. The performance itself is a grand sight (and sound) to behold. I cannot explain the raw human emotions found within this stunning exhibition of explosive musical talent; one must experience it in order to believe it. I digress."
4,Great music,"This CD is great and I really enjoyed the tone to the music. It must have been a great concert. It feels as though you are there, with applause and all. It actually gets a little annoying at times, but all in all it is some great music."
3,"It was good, but I didn't like it a whole lot.","This CD was recorded live. It is a CD. I though it was a good CD because it had music on it. Yanni has lots and lots. I hope he is famous. He should be, because. This CD made me happy. I like horsies."
1,"Hate the quality, love the content","I absolutely love the music on this CD, and I love the DVD. However, the quality of the CD is not good. Song number 8 skips, every time. Disappointing."
4,Blue Collar Thumbs Up,"I am a blue collar, rock and roll guy. I'm not the typical yuppy, new aged, birkenstock wearing soccer dad. NOW~ I will say this album is outright fantastic. It's a plus for people who know and appreciate music. If you can get past Yanni's looks, the music is LARGE, and awesomely dynamic. This guy has a ton of talent. I fully reccommend this CD ONLY IF you appreciate music. If you're a narrow minded, slack-jawwed neanderthal this one is way beyond you.~~Go Get it~!~~~"
5,Live at the Acropolis (CD & DVD),This cd is full of the best music from Yanni. i loved the cd i gave it a two thumbs up.
5,To help rectify the average rating.,"If someone gives this CD 1 star there is something wrong with them. I can conceive not liking this CD, but not hating it. The purpose of this review is to help increase the average rating from 4.5 to 5 stars. It is half a star less because of the mental degenerates who unduefully attack this music using their gooey masses they dare call brains."
2,Why the excitement?,"Yanni doesn't make very good music. People on this site are comparing him to Beethoven and Chopin, seriously. There's simply no comparison between ""Reflections of Passion"" and say ""Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune"" by Claude Debussy or George Bizet's ""Carmen."" So no thanks Yanni, I'll take the real classics."
1,"Oh NO, Not Another Kenny G!","Another guy who is lumped together with other jazz artists. An instrumentalist who is repetitive, unimaginative, and soulless. Where do they find these guys?"
1,Meaningless Drivel,This is a pure unadulterated waste of time. The compositions are weak and predictable. This yanni cult thing can only be the result of massive implants of brain controlling devices by aliens. Save your brain and money and listen to something anything other then these sonic escapades into the great black void. I would give my copy away but it was a gift so i am stuck with it for awhile.. I would rather listen to mento commercials.
2,Yaaaaaaaawn - eee . . . . .( wake me when it's over),"Yanni has undenyable talent and there is skillful musicianship throughout. This doesn't change the fact that LIVE AT THE ACROPOLIS is some of the cheesiest, most syrup-y music I've ever been subjected to. Yawn-i lives up to his name - this is boring."
1,I Thought this CD stunk!,If there was ever a worse CD than this I would be amazed. He should be performing circus acts not singing.
1,Yanni-Ugh,"Yanni needs to learn some of the basics about music. I suggest he start by learning to play the kazoo. I suggest that he end by playing the kazoo-in private and far, far away. Endless repetitions that should never have begun."
1,(If I could do zero stars I would have),"Ah HAH! Once again popular culture has produced an artist so filthy, so disgusting, that mere words do not do him(it?) justice. Yanni, with his skin like jell-o, has produced songs of such terrible quality that they sound like a four-year-old's with some precocious knowledge of two chords. ""Beautiful?"" Try ""repetetive"", ""unimaginative"", ""sappy"", ""filthy"", ""vomit-inducing"", or ""makes-your-skin-crawl-with-violent-tendencies."" To make everything worse, the ""artist"" (hah!) looks like he was mass-produced in a doll factory. A doll factory gone wrong, way wrong. In fact, it is my personal opinion that he is holographic, and would dissolve at the merest touch. If one enslaved under Yanni's power listened to real music for half an hour, they would forsake this gibbering fool and go on to better things."
4,"house nation america,morillo,ll vega","excellent house music blending,sure to get behinds off the wall to throw down on the dance floordeep,funky,and sexy!these DJS are some of my favorite mixologists ll vega & E morillo"
4,Not Bad,This book isn't bad. It's not great but it's not bad. I enjoyed how the author developed the characters. I feel like Ms. Jacobs didn't fully explain the back story but that's ok you get enough of it to figure out what's going on. I felt the ending was a little too out of the blue. It was weird. I think a lot of people will think they couldn't figure it out because it comes out of the blue. I enjoyed the female lead detective and her back story. You feel really connected to her and want her to come through in the end. I just felt it was wrapped up too fast without much explanation. I enjoyed it but not as much as I could have.
5,Versatile Author,"Jonnie Jacobs proves once again what a versatile author she is. This is not a book in any of her usual series, yet it is still as well-written and as full of nail-biting suspense as her other books. I can't wait for the next book by this great author!"
5,Impeccable writing,"Jonnie Jacobs does a beautiful job in every respect--character, plot and impeccable writing. My only quibble is a personal one. Long complicated endings make me squirm. It's terrible being stuck to a chair for the duration--exactly the way Jonnie Jacobs planned it![[[...]]]"
5,A real gem in the rocks,"I am addicted to free books from amazon. I watch carefully and often get books free that have a cost later. This was one of those free when I got it, but not now. Free books can be duds or ok or great as this one was. It was like discovering a real diamond in a pile of rocks. The characters are believable, ones I cared about and whose actions seemed perfectly reasonable under the circumstances. The story was real, the mystery had twists and turns that were believable and hinted at without being revealed until the ""right"" time. This is a book I would pay for. It had plenty of twists but they didn't seem contrived, just a blending to a satisfying end. Well worth reading!"
1,Don't believe the reviews,"This book is a sophmoric version of a who dunnit. I always read a book in one sitting, it took me 3 days to get through this one even though I skipped the boring pages.The author spends many chapters setting up a character's character, yet still points out his actions (as if we wouldn't recognize the conservative person doing something conservative)everytime he does something within character that is important to the plot.I read more sophisticated books in the 4th grade."
4,I loved the book.,"The book was recommended by the book club that I belong to. I had never readanything by this author and was pleasantly surprised how exciting it was. Iread it in two days and had a hard time putting it down. In fact, I re-read itso I could keep track of all the characters. The book club gave it a big thumbs up when we met and reviewed the book."
1,A drip off the old block,"I purchased this kettle based on the strong reviews. It heated water very well for two days, but there appeared to be some condensation around the bottom of the kettle. We soon realized that the kettle was, in fact, leaking at the lower seems.So I returned the kettle and ordered a replacement. This time, it didn't have a small leak on the seam. It had a very large leak. Water was actually running out of the kettle and dripping on the electric base below. Needless to say, that's not a functional way for a kettle to work.So this product is 0 for 2. I missed the return window, so I've got a scrap kettle. And I still have to use the stove to make tea. Not recommended."
1,It leaked!,"Maybe i just got a lemon, but the seal about an inch above the bottom was leaking after just a few days' use. Seems like a design flaw..returned. Besides that i liked it, and i was hunting hard to minimize plastic...."
1,Overall disappointment,"After two weeks of light usage, it started to show rust in 3 different spots inside the kettle along the bottom seam. The kettle worked fine, maybe a bit big and bulky for tea/coffee use. Measuring marks beneath the handle is basically useless because it has condensation in it the whole time."
3,"Nice Product, Wish it Lasted Longer","Really liked the design of this kettle: holds a lot of water, auto shut off has worked well, get the water boiling quickly, and the detachable base are very nice features. Unfortunately after a year and seven months, it's leaking. I use the kettle about 3-5 times per week. I had a cheap corded kettle before that and it lasted well over five years."
1,"Very disappointing, broke within 3 months","I bought this electric water kettle for myself and one for my daughter. In less than 3 months one kettle would not turn off automatically and the other kettle made a loud popping noise that got progressively louder. Amazon would not take the returns as it was over 1 month from the purchase date. The manufacturer, Edge Craft, has a Limited Warranty that directs the kettles be mailed to them, at the owners expense, so that they can determine if the fault was the purchaser's or that the product is defective so they can then decide whether the kettles should be repaired or replaced. I no longer want the water kettles considering the danger they present and a refund would have been preferable. I have ordered 2 new water kettles elsewhere.Barbara Hourigan"
2,Chef's Choice 678 a dissapoitment,"After using the kettle for a few days, about 30% of the bottom outer edges started to corrode, wonder If could be returned or is it a common incident with this design."
1,"Will not last, junk product","I am sorry, if a product can't last longer then a couple of years, then it is only a piece of junk. As many other here report, works great for a while, then one day it fails to shut off, overheats, and dies permanently. Would not buy any of their products again. Off the landfill with another piece of junk."
1,Broke after 6 months,"I got this kettle as a wedding present. It worked fine for about 6 months and then just stopped abruptly. We used it fairly regularly, but nothing out of the ordinary. Frustrating."
1,Not good in the long haul,"I've owned this product for about a year. I've used it every day. The 1st 3 months it worked well, though my husband had a hard time reading the water level indicator.The 1st hint of trouble to come was that it would dribble a small amount of water from where the on/off switch is. Then it wouldn't turn off. The automatic shut off feature was one of the main reasons we bought it. The water would boil, the light would go out, then, the water would start boiling again....this would last until we turned it off manually. This was an intermittant problem, one, at 1st, I thought was our fault.Today, we came home after being gone for 2 hours. The kettle had somehow been left in the on position. And apparently it boiled itself dry and then died! At best, it is unreliable, at worst, probably hazardous."
1,disappointed,"At first I was very satisfied with the kettle. This was our second one. The first one started to rost on the inside, we sent it back for exchange. Then this one (the second one) started to rost inside as well as started to leak. Now we are done with it. I can not recommend it at all."
2,"Doesn't last, leaks","As many others have said, this kettle works very well...until it starts leaking. It heats water quickly and does not taste of plastic. However, it only lasts about a year, at most. The first one that I had began leaking just after the warranty ended. I wrote to Chef's Choice, and they sent me a brand new kettle--nice! However, less than a year later that one is also leaking from the base. Into the trash it goes!! Never more, never more..."
1,Bummer Experience,Within one month the hinge on the lid broke so the lid fell off every time I used it. Then a few months later it started to leak. When I would fill it up at night to be ready for the AM there was a large puddle on the counter. Won't be buying this brand again. Wouldn't recommend it. Now have a Bon Jour - more $$ but lasts forever.
2,Base started melting after a year,"We liked this product very much at first, but it has not stood the test of time. After about a year we started smelling a burnt plastic smell when we used it. Now after another half year, the plastic base has begun to melt significantly. I opened it up and one of the power wires seems to be overheating. I'm going to buy another carafe, but not a Chef's Choice."
2,Early demise,"We really liked ours. We'd shopped hard for a replacement kettle that we'd had for a long time, no longer available, which a house guest had absent mindedly put on the stove top. We settled on the Chef's Choice and were pleased with its appearance and function.Within three months, though, its on/off light became unreliable and then it quit shutting off and then it quit coming on.Pffft!I gave it two stars instead of one because it was pretty nifty while it was alive."
1,beware of rust,"I have used the kettle for about 1 year now and I loved it in the beginning. A few months ago I noticed rust on the inside bottom seam, which is very dissappointing considering the price. I used the ""Chef's Choice 675 International Cordless Electric Hot Pot"" before that and I will go back to that one. The 675 hot pot is not perfect either, on my first, the lid stopped working after a while - meaning it opened up when the water was boiling, preventing the automatic shut-off. However, since I'm not leaving the kitchen anyway while boiling water, I rather deal with the non-rosting 675 hot pot."
5,Great kettle for a larger group,"Chef's Choice 678 Cordless Electric KettleWe have serious tea drinkers in our office, so the tea kettle has to be great. This one is the perfect size for groups. It boils the water very quickly. The only drawback is the gauge for water is located under the handle, making it diffuclt to see how much water is in the pot."
2,Great for a while,"I had this product for about 3 weeks and it worked really well for a while; however, it developed a large rust spot on the inside of the pot. It's a pity because I thought I had found the ideal non-plastic electric tea kettle. Back to the drawing board."
4,Solid,"Taj Mahal always makes good albums, and this is no exception. Not great, but consistently good throughout. Can't go wrong."
5,Superb book!,"I have read both of Gary Smith's books (Live the Dream and this latest book). Both are excellent. Gary Smith separates what's important in stock futures trading from the garbage. He reveals numerous contrarian strategies, sentiment indicators, and some technical indicators that he follows. People, trading successfully is not easy and it's not a static system. Everything is constantly evolving. Reading Smith's books has driven this point home with me. Smith also stresses the importance of being able to synthesize particular indicators to get a feel for how to trade. Excellent, insightful book! I feel sorry for others who strongly disagree...perhaps you'll reconsider after your trading account dwindles. (And no, I'm not related to Gary Smith.)"
1,Simply THE WORST!,"In regards to the techniques discussed in the book, these divergence techniques NEVER work. They seem to catch the big movements, but they never do. They do an extremely poor job at timing the market. By the way, I LOST MONEY USING THESE TYPE OF STRATEGIES. The book is filled of pure basic techniques. I would definitely go with Trading For A Living by Alexander Elder. P.S. I did throw the book away."
5,DESTINED TO BECOME A TRADING CLASSIC!,"I've read dozens of trading books over the years and this is the best yet. ""How I Trade for a Living"" is an intelligent, straightforward look at a successful trading professional who's not promoting seminars or newsletters. Gary Smith is giving readers the benefit of his 30+ years of trading experience. What's important to me is that he's got the documentation to back it all up.As a follower of Gary Smith since 1996, I've been impressed with his knowledge and understanding of today's market. His research and insights have saved me years of trial and error in my personal trading.This is not a get rich quick book. Smith outlines a low-risk trading strategy that works, but it is intense. It requires dedication, discipline and more time than some people might want to devote. Still, if you've ever dreamed of being a home based trader, this is the book you should buy, read and STUDY."
2,Interesting but noToby Crabel,This book reveals almost nothing that is of any practical use.Now if you are looking for a practical approach to trading - try Toby Crabel's books or articles - atleast gives you a statistical edge on how successfull your trades will be if you follow the opening range system.
5,Right kind of material,"I read this book after losing tonnes of money in the bubble. This was AFTER the fact. However this book revealed so many layers of professional trading to me that I was surprised. It was a revelation. I have read many many other books afterwards but even then Gary's book was my FIRST (very much like first love), and I highly recommend it.Though I will say that much of the material is not original. Most of the indicators are taken from somewhere else, and Gary has provided appropriate references as well. Beauty lies in summarizing and presentation of the indicators that will save you invaluable time taken to read numerous other books.Gary is a perma-bull. That is somewhat surprising, as that will not be ""trading"" at all. Nevertheless, the indicators outlined in this book will keep you in sync with the market. Sometimes it is very difficult to remember all this information, though this stuff really WORKS.This is one level above trite technical analysis."
3,Not for technical traders,"Gary did a great job in describing what his life as a private trader is like. He has also gave a brief review of his road to trading success. This is the interesting part.What I could not really agree is his disbelieve in technical analysis (didn't he just shown some charts in his book). Being a technical trader myself, I trade on price action, and price action is best shown in the chart!"
2,Less than impressed...,"Yes, there are some helpful hints in this book. But Gary starts off by explaining how as a chartist for 19 years he was a failure, how all the various indicators and technical analysis techniques failed miserably and only work on history. Then he admits that during those 19 years, most of his trades were entered NOT on the basis of charts and/or any technical analysis at all, but rather on the daily summaries in the WSJ. HARDLY a technical trading approach. I don't see how anyone who traded the way he traded for 19 years has any right to an opinion on technical analysis, charting, and indicators. He did not use them, or did not know how to use them. The guy had no trading discipline, plan or approach, so all he should be able to conclude is - technical analysis doesn't work if you don't use it. It's like hoping to win the lottery without buying a ticket. TA works if YOU work at it.Other than that, the book is okay. There are much better books out there, though."
3,My view on this book.,"This is a good book if you trade trending securities. Don't look at this book if you trade grains or other non-linear futures.But...how can I say anything bad about a guy who can turn $2,000 into close to a million dollars. Buy this book if you want to make a million dollars. Don't buy this book if you are looking for methods to trade grains.**********Update 4/05I read this book again. I have to say he has good ideas. When I first read his book I was trading like he used to and didn't want to change. It took about a year for his ideas to sink in to my hard head.**********Update 8/07I wish Gary Smith would write another book."
2,Marginally usefull,"I found Gary's references to his dollar gains deceptive. In my opinion, dollars earned do not have much meaning, percentage returns have more meaning. $1 earned on $100 is more ;-) as compared to $1 earned on $10,000.Dennis"
1,Doesn't follow volume?,"Gary Smith does not believe in volume at all in day trading! Volume is essential for trading, especially day trading. When I read that part, the book lost all credibility."
2,trading for a living,"Great for bull market 1982 on,not much info for bears however.Not a chartist,i'am surprised he doesn't believe in astrology either.Dats Gooot."
3,Very Helpful,"Gary's book was very helpful to me. It gave me a lot of insight on trading techniques. He confused me by saying that he did not use Technical analysis, yet the book covered it extensively. Gary does no online trading. He makes all of his trades via phone to his broker."
3,dissapointing,"This is definitely not a handbook. It is a collection of papers. The index is missing basic items like Modified cosine transform - MDCT, Short time Fourier transform - STFT, Hanning window, so one cannot tell if they are included."
2,Only useful for the 1st time mother,"I have no doubt that this book is great for the first time mother, but for someone who has had a child previously, there was not a lot of new information. There is a lot of good basic pregnancy information here, but much of the multiple pregnancy info could be concluded from singleton pregnancy books and good common sense. I wanted specific information on what I could do to prevent pre-term labor, how much to eat and what, and my limitations. This book did not enlighten me very much at all."
2,Not very useful or informative,"I found this book to be lacking in information as well as very repetitive. Much of the information she includes is no different than what can be found in a regular pregnancy book. In addition, she feels the need to define words that, in my opinion, if you don't know the definition of, you should probably not have gotten pregnant. Also, this book is in desperate need of a revision. Nothing huge, but in the section about bed rest, she references watching videos on your VCR as well as programming your doctor's number into your speed dial."
2,"The Multiple Pregnancy Sourcebook: Pregnancy and the First Days with Twins, Triplets, and More","Not a lot of content that is different from books on single pregnancy. Poorly written, including many testimonials."
5,Must-Have for First Time Mothers to Multiples,This book was a great read for a first-time mother to twins. It gave purely facts and information on what to expect throughout pregnancy up to delivery.
5,"BEAUTIFUL, relaxing music!","This is soothing music whether you choose to fall asleep to it, eat dinner to it, relax to it............anything. Simply beautiful. So glad I found this artist--highly recommended!!!"
3,Great resource book,This book will give you the tools to paint various landscapes...Also there are photos on how to paint the various elements that are in the paintings....Good book to have...
3,Best of joy of painting,"A nice guide with lots of examples of Bob Ross's style,if you like this type of paintings."
2,Not Recommended,"I have always enjoyed Bob Ross' style of painting and am a devoted fan of his television show, but I found this book lacking. Not only are the step-by-step instructions in black and white, but I found that very few of these particular paintings were ones I cared to paint. I believe I'll stick to the television show where I can see and hear the nuances of his painting live."
2,Shows the shortcomings,"The idea behind Ross' concept of wet painting may be intriguing, but, as this book shows, the results cannot match any seriously crafted oil painting. The paintings all look the same and have the same faded 80ies style. I would not even recommend this book (or style of painting) to novices as it would spoil your technique and hinder you in developing your own style. This is not instant art. It`s instant trash. Sorry. And yes I have bought this book and am allowed to review it."
3,Good BUT....,"This item is practical and well designed. I've got one and have ordered another one lately. The only problem with this product is after a few months the part of the hook that goes the inside of the tank begins to rust. If the rust gets significant enough, the rust falls into the water bowl and begins to make the water a diluted tea colored brown. This is not attractive. The manufacturer needs to figure out a way to keep the chrome from rusting inside the tank. Perhaps a plastic coating will do. I'll be coating my next one with clear fingernail polish to see if that will do the trick."
2,Results disappointing,"I really didn't like this cookbook at all. I am very into healthy, low-fat cooking, but I want recipes to be simple and turn out good. Pretty much every recipe I tried in this book (except for the pecan pancakes, which are quite good), turned out flat and tasteless, and often I had to purchase special ingredients and put in a lot of effort and cooking time. I also didn't find too much of a variety here--the recipes are categorized by mealtime so if you are looking, for example, for a lot of creative ways to make salmon or shrimp, you won't find it here. The health information is useful and educational, but doesn't add much to the quality of this book as a cookbook."
3,"Mad Men is a great production, but in season 5 it is getting too close to the time when these characters were anachronistic.","The acting is supurb, the writing, costumes and all that are top notch, but I am old enough to remember getting in an elevator in Manhattan and everyone lighting up and by this time in the series these guys weren't hip any longer- they were getting to be on the nose and a few years later they were decidedly old hat. It is too bad, but that was the 1960s and by the 70s these people were so out of touch with the youth culture they didn't matter anymore."
4,"Great Show, but had some streaming issues","Loved this show, but the Amazon view instant feature I purchased this series on had some streaming issues. There were a few more interuptions for buffering than I regularly have with other video streaming source, but these interuptions were not out of control. I also noticed I seemed to have more interuptions when I was trying to watch on my PC than when I used Amazon Instant Video through my Xbox. Interuptions were almost non-existant when I switched to watching using the Xbox app."
3,Madmen 5,Not as good as the previous four series. Worth watching but doesn't have the pace or hold the interest in the way that it did.
3,Disappointing,"After a long wait, this season wasn't up to expectations. Just watched it out of habit, but disappointing storyline. still enjoy the characters and the atmosphere of the ad industry and the 60's, though."
5,Love it!,"I am really hooked to all the seasons. All actors and actresses did a great job. Like their attire too. I did not grow up in this country, nor in that age, but somehow I felt carried easily into their life."
2,"Mad Men has ""Jumped the Shark!"" Season 5 was TERRIBLE and depressing.","I WAS a HUGE Mad Men fan and I own Seasons 1-4 on DVD. Season 5 is HORRIBLE! Every episode is depressing and has something to do with death or unhappiness. A majority of Season 5 focused on the now seriously balding, extremely depressed Pete Campbell and the extremely depressed Lane Pryce. Didn't need to see Sally in the bathroom. Boring, depressing, uninteresting. I really wanted to give it 1 star but I like the costumes and Roger Sterling."
3,Poor Quality Video/ Great show,"I watched all four seasons on netflix and was hooked. I am embarrassed I couldn't wait until the fifth season was available on Netflix too. I searched all over the internet for a free viewing of season five but without success. I did find the cheapest rate on amazon for about $23 but the video quality was so poor I would never do it again. I could have ordered the disk set for $10 more. But I would never watch them a second time. Oh, well. Next time I will wait. Great season, though!"
3,Very poor sound,"I've seen all the other episodes, and had no problem hearing them. This was HORRIBLE, and no subtitles. I finally just turned it off and didn't finish."
1,possibly the biggest ripoff,Thank you Amazon for hosting this entirely impossible to watch LOW QUALITY stream. Now i will continue stealing this program as I have for the prior 4 seasons. F AMC and Amazon
3,Did I miss something?,"In typical Mad Men fashion nothing really happened in two hours of television but the cast looked damn good, and they did it (nothing) super cool. It was a disappointing season premiere. I hope and trust that the season will get better after this slow start."
3,Freezes quite a bit,"My husband and I are huge Mad Men fans. When we finished watching the series on Hulu and wanted to continue the only place to get it immediately was Amazon. Since I'm a prime member and have purchased videos to stream in the past, we decided to purchase it. While we are able to see the episodes, for the price of the streaming video, I would not make a purchase like this again. There are too many interruptions in the streaming. The video can be very choppy. I should have just purchased the Blu Ray and waiting the 2 days for it to be shipped."
1,Not even worth getting a star from me.,"The episode title, ""Far Away Places"" seemingly implies to me like the writers of MAD MEN are all gone somewhere. Maybe their sidekicks tried to make up their bosses' absence with a redundant episode, I guess. This episode is totally absurd. NO PLOT. DON'T WATCH IT."
1,What a bad episode,"Not sure what the point of this episode was. Completely incoherent, poor storyline and the LSD scene was pure blah. Not good at all and did not advance the characters or the plot a bit."
3,season five,"Some of the situations seem a bit forced, not as good as previous years Am still glad I have it however"
3,Not as good as the earlier seasons,The story line goes flat in this episode.A little disappointing .I may try the other episodes to give it more chance.
4,good show - amazon video player keeps dropping,"Amazon's video player dropped the stream 5 times while I was watching the show - thanks amazon. The deficiencies in the video player are so detrimental to the experience that I regret having made the purchase, even though I really like the show itself."
2,Buyer's from Europe keep your hands off !,"I am a big fan of MAD MEN and really enjoy watching each an every episode.However being located in Switzerland and the fact that the DVD are have regionalprotection don't allow me to watch it with my DVD player on TV, but only on my PC.This is far less comfortable than sitting on my couch thus only 2 stars."
4,"Not Bad, Had Its Moments","Not a bad season of Mad Men, def had its moments. And it still has that Mad Men feel. Worst part of the season is Megan (cute girl, but perhaps too free-spirited for Don?)."
1,What Happened?,"I used to really enjoy this show and looked forward to it each week. It was well written and followed several different story lines that were meaningful or at least interesting. Now, I feel like I'm watching mostly Don and his annoying love for that silly young wife with everyone else cast in a bit part. I agree with the other reviewer that it's not about business anymore. If they want to weave in the events of the time, it could still be done in a much better and more subtle way. The show is now disjointed, BORING, and unconvincing. I won't be watching it again. I'm sticking with the HBO dramas. At least they are well-written and I know when the show is about fantasy land!"
4,Missing,I've truly missed Betty's character throughout this season. She has been a crucial part of the MadMen series and going an entire season with only a tiny glimpse into her life isn't fair.
5,thanks,"thanks for ease of use. easier than going to the video store and probably cheaper too. appreciate it , great show."
5,best series on tv,I think this is the best season to date. This season was very experimental and had a very different feel.
5,Awesome Series,What a wonderful view of the work environment and the advertisement industry in the 1960's. We love the series and can't get enough!!
5,YAY for Mad Men!,"I had no problem watching these episodes at all, and I am thrilled to have found them on Amazon. I had been catching up on MM through NetFlix, but this particular season was unavailable for quite a while. Thanks for not leaving me ""hanging on"" while waiting for their NetFlix release:-) God bless,ANne."
3,constant freezing,"there was a tip that runs quickly across screen that tells you to disable screensaver prior to viewing. first of all, i'm not sure how to do this and didn't want to mess up PC. But the constant stopping and moving the mouse was driving me crazy!! The quality of the HD episode was just as poor as the regular so I saved the dollar and kept watching regular episodes. I was a little disappointed in the ending. Not sure what I expected but it felt ""off""."
4,A snapshot of an era.,"As a former agency partner I appreciate the quality of these stories. The politics are real. so is the striving for message excellence and the value of a ""big idea""."
2,Priced Too High,"Given I have plus (which I am not sure what i really get in the way of videos from having plus), the cost of a single episode or a series seems way too high. Especially the added cost for HD. The rating reflects the price, not the high quality of the Mad Men series."
4,Better the second time around,"Watching this season again at one sitting, you pick up the clues scattered throughout the season. You also appreciate the thematic threads runnng through each episode. Just sorry Jared Harris won't be back in season six."
4,Not Bad,"The first commenter must of watched it at the wrong time. I just finished the first episode and the only time I noticed any artifacts was during dark scenes, which are few in the episode. I didn't notice any blurring at all, even with the video in full-screen mode at 1900x1200 (no, I didn't purchase the HD version). My head is also about 3 feet away from the monitor. The quality is not bad.As for the first episode of the long-awaited show, Draper's wife certainly looks better than she did in the fourth season (or at least I thought so) and its nice to see Sterling actually more involved with clients (despite the feud). This is only the first and it wasn't a bad way to start off the season I thought. No signs of Miss Jones in the episode but Don's kids make an appearance."
3,How to Fail at a Bonus Feature,"The introduction to Season 5, ""Special Feature: How to Succeed in Business Draper Style"", told me everything I already knew about anything anyway. It's sort of explaining how Santa Claus works to a thirty-seven year old.To be patronized by elementary commentary made me want to get all Don Draper on their...""Bonus-size"" is no bonus if you're taking out the substance in order to add artificial flavor."
3,"A slow start, but I'm optimistic!","This episode was just okay. However, Mad Men has not let us down and I look forward to seeing what happens in the next few episodes."
4,"Great show, good quality video","The only time I had any issue at all was with the video stopping and waiting for it to continue- which was when I was at someone's home with a weak internet signal. When I was home (where I have 6.0Mbps), it ran perfectly fine, no shaking or stopping. I'm happy with my purchase!"
1,"Terrific show, but Amazon's Instant Video Service is torture.","It's like watching the program in 20 second pieces in between stalls, delays, and restarts. Buy the discs or wait for Netflix to get it."
1,Damaged goods,"Package arrived in record time. However the disc one was defective and wood not play, no reason to proceed to disc 2,3,4. Would like to send it back for replacement."
1,poor picture quality,"This review is about the picture quality. This great show was in sync, but quite blocky. I wish I had known that before making the decision to purchase. The beautiful cinematography of Mad Men could not be enjoyed."
3,Amusing,It continues the line of previous seasons.We saw it all in only one session.¿We need the 6th season!!!
4,MAD MAN,It was a well thought out season by the script writers and true to life episode. Please keep the series going.
5,Loved It,"It's just so 60s. Right in every aspect of the thinking and dress of the time. Rent it please, please"
5,Mid-Century Modern starts to appear this season,Love Don's new apartment. Excellent writing and character development. Seasons is dense with a lot going on. Blu Ray quality is excellent.
5,Mad Men,I love Mad Men - every single episode gets 5 stars from me. I can't wait for next season!Especially for those of us who lived through the sixties in New York...what more can I say?? Great series!
4,"Have faith until episode ""7""!","I agreed with the the one star reveiw until the ""Codfish Ball"" episode. For all the Mad Men fans out there, beware... there was definitely something off with the first few episodes (although, JON HAMM did a great job directing his episode, it was poorly written and ill-conceived). I suspect the producers did a focus group and received feedback that something just seemed ""off"" this season. Especially, in my opinion, Peggy; I know the point is to emphasize the evolution of the female in the 60's but her character went too far, too fast... drinking, smoking, mouthing off to everyone! The return of a more balanced plotline (and character arcs) restores my faith in this show!"
2,damaged DVD,"I have experienced skipped screens at twice during the show. It affected my understanding about the plot, had to do some guessing work."
5,What - it's the 60's?,"The only problem with watching this to the end is I can't see what happens next... yet.Oh, well. Guess I will start with Season 1 again."
5,Awesome Show!,Definitely a show worth checking out. Great actors and commentary about the time that the show was based on. Awesome buy!
5,Love MADMEN!,Good to watch Season 5 at my convenience before Season 6 begins in April!I have purchased all 5 seasons of this series and have rewatched each season before the new season beginsand highly recommend it.
3,Box was a little scuffed-up,"The actual show itself was amazing, as usual. However, the box in which it came in was a little scuffed up...it wasn't exactly brand new, though it was rated as 'new'."
2,Downloads were incomplete,"I tried to watch a marathon of Mad Men, only to find the downloads were not worth the bother. No where to fix it on the spot. Disappointing."
1,Played the wrong episode and didn't ever work,"I hope I don't get charged for this.... grr. I clicked on one link, ""The Other Woman"", and the thing never started but said it was playing some other episode."
2,Save your $$$$,"Definitely a lackluster season when the highlights are ""Zou Bisou"", Campbell's extra-marital affair ends in electroshock and a suicide in the office enveloped in a cloud of Heinz Beans and Jaguar surrounded by how far Joan went to get that partnership, capped off with a little girls first period brings mother and daughter together. Now WTF does ANY of this have to do with the agency at all? (except for them becoming EOE?) Again save your money."
2,I rate this episode officially crap,This episode was completely pointless. After last week they had no idea what to do with it. Unfortunately the people on discussion forums had more interesting theories for what would happen. Total snoozefest.
1,$1.99 Mistake - don't do it!,"I bought this thinking it was Episode 1, not some strange lesson on sales. It's not even watchable and is just exploiting the brand. I love Mad Men so I didn't spend enough time reading other reviewers' comments."
1,WHAT HAPPENED?!?!,"I have been a loyal fan of this show ever since it started. I even got the first four seasons on dvd and re-watched them- they are even better the second time around. So like all other fans of the show I waited patiently for over a year for season five to come out. All I can say is: WHAT HAPPENED?! The show is absurd as well as deeply frustrating in that every time some juicy idea is mentioned we think this is going to be cool but then it is promptly dropped and we are left wondering, again, WHAT HAPPENED?! Sadly, all good things must come to an end and I believe that is true for Mad Men. I have been a fan of other shows such as Breaking Bad, Damages, Hell On Wheels, The Walking Dead and Sons Of Anarchy but not a fan of shows like The Sopranos, The Killing or The Wire. Hopefully that will give others an idea of what I like and dislike so they will have something to which to compare my review."
1,jewish,This series is a story written by a jewish person called Matt Weiner. Mr. Weiner has an agenda. It is pro-jew and PROFOUNDLY ANTI-WHITE. Whites are the villians and jews are the heros. Nough said.
1,insufferable pap,"like the text of a how-to-succeed-in-business book, backed up by simplistic readings of various mad men scenes. i can't believe amc sanctioned this."
1,Worth less than free,"Worth less than free! I was very disappointed in this waste of time. The first two business people shown at the beginning were quite annoying; preachy, full of rah-rah management slogans. These are the phonies I make a point to avoid day-to-day. Anyway, not fun watching. We decided to watch some of the Ep.4 episodes instead."
5,Wild about Mad Men,"After ""discovering"" the first 4 Seasons of Mad Men on Netflix and being completely captivated I was looking everywhere for Season 5. Of course,Amazon came through for us and we were easily able to download it to our new internet ready TV. We carefully made sure that we only watched one episode a night, just to make it last longer. Season 5 was not a disappointment ... lots of twists and turns and unexpected surprises. If you are a Mad Men ""addict"", get Season 5; you won't be disappointed. Now, WHEN oh WHEN does Season 6 begin!!"
5,AWESOME,LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF THIS SERIES. DIDN'T WANT IT TO END. HOPE THEY COME BACK WITH MORE AND NEVER STOP...
5,Mad Men was GREAT,Watching all the Mad Men series in order without wating between seasons gave me the full picture of the series and left me wanting to see more!!
1,Defective,This product was shipped twice because the first on was defective. Guess what..... the replacement was defective as well !
2,"Clever concept, so-so execution","Not bad, but much of the analysis seemed kind of forced. Basic Executive MBA program type recommendations with a few twist entries, then search for clips that fit each recommendation."
4,GOOD START WITH A GOOD CHANCE THINGS WILL GET BETTER.,"Creator and writer Matthew Weiner did a good job laying the groundwork and story lines for what may yet prove to be an excellent season. Naturally, one cannot achieve top speed in any endeavor immediately, nor would it be dramatically effective to do so. Give Matthew a chance. I am sure he will take the main characters in interesting directions soon enough."
2,Review of Mad Men Season 5,"I think this season is boring compared to the others. I don't care for the ""new girlfriend"" and honestly, We didn't even look forward to watching it from episode to episode. I guess that is it. I hope they don't continue the series."
5,LOVE IT.,LOVE IT. More than a soap opera. Great drama. Well developed characters. Good plot lines. Just excellent. Love John Hamm.
3,Mad Men Season 5,"This season feels a bit like it is trying to be better, bigger, more insanely egotistical than Seasons 1-4. I had grown fond of Don Draper and in Season 5 I feel he becomes somewhat foolish in his impulsive decision to marry Megan. Somehow the characters are becoming cartoons of themselves,and their behavior a bit more unlikeable. Now I find myself a bit less interested in these people. They ALL seem shallow and doomed for unfortunate outcomes. Visually the season is as rich and enticing as 1-4."
2,Why are they going off?,"Can't believe they've left so many interesting plots from previous seasons of MAD MEN undeveloped. How did Duck Philips lose out after SC was acquired by the Brits? How did the ""Quitting Tobacco"" letter written by Draper help or not help the Agency? Old man Cooper packed up and left after the ""Letter"" fiasco and just returned without any explanation of how? They had this interesting way of going back in time to explain stuff. Why have they stopped doing that? Is that the end of Dr Miller? Is that the end of Carla who seemed to know so much about the Draper household? How about Peggy's struggles with her faith? Pete's feelings for her and the child together. The list goes on. They need to concentrate more on the emotional relationships between all these characters and Don's mesmerizing talent as an Ad Man to keep viewers' interest. The first three episodes of season 5 have been way below par. The show is loosing it's appeal."
4,Mad Men: Season five,This series is going to be ranked as one of the best ever on national TV. And the fifth season is no exception.
2,Infinite Loading Screen,"I thought that I would be able to stream these videos, and I am used to occasional loading screens when using my xbox to watch movies online, but I have never had such a hard time watching and online video before. A loading screen popped up nearly every 15 seconds and makes the series unwatchable.And it is not my internet connection because I tryed both netflix and hulu tuesday and wednesday after I was having troubles watching the video and they worked seamlessly.I am upset that I payed so much for this and I cannot even watch it properly. I hope that the viewing experience get better in the next few days and that amazon instant works better."
2,One disc was scratched,"The show is great, but it was VERY frustrating not to be able to watch one of the discs because it was scratched."
5,Best TV Show Since the Sopranos,"Although, clearly the gang of New York hustlers in this series are a lot more civilized -- the attention to detail by the producers is top notch ... the show gives you a great feel for the sickening '50s era (if you lived through the 50s you'll know what I mean!). The '50s/'60s clothing, furniture, home decor, etc styles are also right on. It makes for a more realistic viewing experience."
5,Great show,Best show on television by far! tons of great extras included in this set! cant wait for the next season to start.
5,Love this show,Awesome!!! This show is amazing and so easy to watch on Amazon. Can't wait for the next season. So glad they are online
4,So well done,"I did not get the Mad Men craze at first, but when I gave it a second chance, I fell in love. The whole series is extremely well done, the characters are complex and the whole thing is just great entertainment."
5,Fifth season is fabulous,"My wish list was always to have extras that focused on the dialogue. Here it is! Of course, Roger Sterling gets the best lines. The season was especially good at taking the characters out of their bubble and showing the influence of the outside world, for example, the nurses murdered by Richard Speck. There is so much to enjoy here and I plan on having repeat viewings."
5,Love watching Mad Men on Amazon video,"Love downloading Mad Men the day after it airs--it's much better than cable. And I can watch the shows whenever I want, because I own them!"
3,Not so good compared to the 1-4 seasons.,"Too many of the long looks into the distance. Not enough verbal ""drama"" between players. Hope season 6 will rally the writers"
5,Marketing Marvel,Well written series. One I can related to because of the time period. All that smoking brings back memories. An ongoing story of Madison Avenue marketing which really keeps you interested.
5,Can't turn it off...,"I purchased this on my Kindle HD, and watch any time I get a free 5 minutes or more. I have watched all but the last episode of the season in a week. Can't wait for the day to be over so I can see the last episode!"
2,First Amazon Stream,"I purchased this stream as I love Mad Men. Would watch it live but cable TV isn't in my media plan. That said, I have watched all 4 seasons on Netflix multiple times and in our internet age I am no stranger to streaming media content.I have given this episode 2 stars for the following reason-Poor Quality. Partially due to the size of my monitor (larger than avg) but still no excuse. Was very broken in the stream and I was not warned about the resolution causing delays. I did figure this out as I opened this episode onto my smaller monitor.Other than that- I love Mad Men and this product delivered in the content area. I think it's a great option from Amazon to watch TV this way, but this was a bad experience."
2,Poor quality streaming--not worth your money,"I'm a prime member, and I bought the season premiere. I didn't realize that the video quality would be fuzzy and that the second part of the episode (shown on the same night) would be an additional price. On one screen, the second episode was listed as free, but when I downloaded the first part, suddenly the second part was an additional fee.If Amazon charges for video streaming, it should at least deliver a clear picture. My connection time was excellent, with all the bars, but the video stopped a few times to ""connect"" and I had to reload the page once. Apparently this is a problem with Amazon.Best consider another source or pay the HD premium price to watch. It's a bit ridiculous to pay $6 to watch one evening's episode of Mad Mad, though."
1,blah,I watched the 1st 4 seasons on Netflix and when the new season started I ordered the first episode. It didn't grab me in the way I had expected it to so I will be waiting for it to become available on Netflix rather than paying for each episode.
3,Series seems adrift,"I loved the earlier seasons, but this season does not seem to know what to do with itself. It is on verge of becoming soap opera like and does not seem to be heading anywhere and is divided into two camps: Camp A: Soap opera like where very little happens over two hours other than minor character development, Camp B: An unrelated series of episodes. The series seems far off from the starting series. If you are already really into the series, ok maybe buy it, otherwise don't bother."
2,Cancelled my advance order,"24-Sep-2012 update: Last night's Emmy snub might be seen as a vindication of those - including me - who noted this season's nose-dive. I hope MM's writers will rise to the challenge.Judging from the 01-Apr episode, the writers have lost faith in their own ability to create a period drama which is relevant to modern viewers, by means of subtlety, suggestion, art, allegory, contrast, or any other mechanism more elegant than a rubber chicken with a sign about its neck.I generously proffer two stars, as I rather liked the first episode. Others, lacking tasks of importance in their lives, may be pleased to find that the rest of the season will not have degenerated into pratfalls and sound effects. So that their collective Hope is not dashed, I will reserve my right to Change my rating by one-half star."
1,Garbage,They really should have quite while ahead - this looks a lot like some college work. This is not even close to the first 4 seasons in terms of quality - too bad- I really wanted to like it.
1,Season 5 Mad Men,Can not give it a good rating as we have been unable to view it. When will season five be available for streaming?
1,TERRIBLE QUALITY.,"The video stream would be all jumpy, audio/video out of sync a lot, blurry image half the time. This is why I go netflix and Hulu... amazon just doesn't compare."
2,Predictable & boring,"Instead of getting better, the show and the characters have become more predictable and even less likeable.I couldn't relate to any of them. I'm not looking forward to Season 6"
3,Not exciting,It seems like the writing this season wasn't as good. Betty's is no longer interesting and don's new wife and life seem boring to me.
4,Kind of Losing Steam,"Mad Men is still interesting enough to watch, but the storyline really didn't advance much this season. I hate that all of the shows that I watch limit their seasons to 12 episodes, as does Mad Men. It feels like there is no wrap-up to the season, it just ends because it has reached its 12-episode limit."
4,"On average, four star",Many episodes were five star but 2 or 3 we rated as 3 or less. Looking forward to the new season.
2,VIDEO/AUDIO QUALITY POOR ... BAD COPY?,I OWN SEASONS 1-4 AND THE VIDEO/AUDIO QUALITY WAS VERY GOOD. SINCE I ENJOY THIS SERIES SO MUCH THAT I WAS HAPPY WHEN SEASON 5 BECAME AVAILABLE. THE QUALITY OF VIDEO/AUDIO IS SUBSTANDARD AND I CANNOT IMAGINE WHY? VERY DISAPPOINTED ... SAVE YOUR MONEY.
2,More like FAR OUT places,"I love, love, love Mad Men but this episode was the biggest disappointment ever in their five year history! I can't believe the producers of this top notch show allowed such an episode go on the air. I sat there watching it and wondering the whole time...am I really watching Man Men? Earth to Mad Men....come back please. Give us what we watch you for...and this isn't it."
3,Mad Men Season 5 - Not enough core character screen/story time,"I LOVE Mad Men seasons 1-4. Season 5 was just full of unnecessary filler. I will tell you the reasons I LOVE Mad Men and they are Don, Joan, Peggy, Roger, Sally and yes even Betty. But this Season strayed from the core/strong/awesome characters to show more of Lane (who I thought was a temp addition from the start), Megan (we never thought there would be a character more annoying then Betty, then Megan came along), and skeezy Pete (who I could care less about). There are definitely stand out episodes from Season 5 that were mostly enjoyable, but I do agree with a lot of reviews that this is a watered-downed season. I hope that we see more of our favorite characters in Season 6. But knowing Matt Weiner, we will just have to make due with what he decides to give us..."
2,Worst season by far...,"it is amazing to me that people loved this season. i've been a fan of Mad Men since day one, and Season 5 isn't good. and not just bad by Mad Men standards. kind of similar to a good band making a bad record. so many bad episodes and storylines: Don's hallucination that he kills one of the many women he's bedded. Pete's Metro-North affair. Harry having sex in his office with some Hari-Krishna woman. Joan prosituting herself for Jaguar (and everyone except Don, who's not a good guy either, going along with it).""Bravo!"" exclaims Cooper when they get the business. give me a break. Roger becoming an LSD freak. yea, right. i could go on and on...not sure whether Matthew Weiner lost his touch, is too full of himself at this point or what. but Season 5 of Mad Men just isn't very good. remains to be seen if the show can recover..."
5,INTERSTING,GOOD ACTING GREAT CAST CAN'T WAIT FOR NEXT SEASON NEVER HAD SEEN THESE ACTORS BEFORE SURE WAS GALD MY SISTER TOLD ME ABOUT THE SHOW
5,Mad for MadMen,"If you haven't seen MadMen yet, start on Season One and work your way to Season Five. If you have seen it, you're likely addicted, so there's no need to hook you in an Amazon review. I will say, Season Five was the strongest season yet. Brilliant writers and an amazing cast make this a worthwhile watch."
4,Worth the Purchase,"The stream is good, and the quality is great. My only complaint is that I have to wait for season 6 to come out."
1,disatisfied customer,"Product ended up not being the correct one i needed for my one touch, also discovered that product was seriously outdated...However when i requested a refund they were compliant and returned my money once they received product back from me. I do hope they trash the product since it was outdated....."
5,Great product!,"My doctor recommended Solger brand, and I've been taking Solger Ester C for over 5 years. I've been health, barely gets sick. I took only 1 sick day in past 5 years at work -- it's definitely working."
3,ANOTHER Easter-C,"I don't personally see any difference between this product and other Easter-Cs out there. To me, that may not merit the extra cost."
2,Upset Stomach,"I'm embarrassed to say I took these for months without realizing the persistent GI problems I was having were caused by these pills. I bought into the hype that they don't cause stomach upset. Then I was stranded an extra day on a business trip due to weather, and didn't have enough with me for the extra day. Suddenly, my stomach was better! When I got back, I took them again, and had an upset stomach again. I stopped, and voila', stomach is fine. So not as advertised in my case."
3,Worked twice,"It worked twice, but then did not want to hold the suction. We think my daughter's arm was too small, but we are testing it still to make sure...if it doesn't work again we'll be sending it back."
2,Didn't work,Bought for my 3 year old when he broke his arm since we go to lake so often. It fit and was easy to use but the suction didn't last witch it was keeps water from getting in at the top. It might work for an adult or older child but not for a small active child.
2,doesn't work very well,"We bought this item for my son when he broke his arm. Unfortunately, it does not seem to work well for us. The water seeps in while he swims, and afterward the upper part of his cast is wet. We followed the directions exactly and we keep using the little suction bulb to tighten it up every ten minutes while he is swimming. Thankfully he gets his cast off in a week. I guess it is better than nothing."
3,Too small for our purposes,"My 12 year old grandson broke his arm for the second time this year right before school got out for the summer. He has a pass to the park district pool within walking distance so we wanted to help him be able to swim. We found the xerosox, hoping that would be the perfect solution. We picked the wrong size. It was way too small for a big 12 year old. We sent it back and exchanged it for a larger one. Unfortunately, it didn't keep the water out and the boy had to get another cast. The doc offered to put on a water proof cast! We didn't know they made such a thing. So, if your child breaks their arm you can ask for one. It makes showering and everything much easier. Several years ago, my older son broke his arm and we got one of these for him and it worked beautifully."
1,Near worthless,"Bare in mind that I returned the one that I bought on Amazon because I had left town and bought one locally. I made dang sure that I put that thing on right, secured the seal, removed all air. When we took it off after some light floating in the water, her cast was wet. The fabric at the top of her arm and bottom near her fingers was soaked. The middle was just a little wet. My wife said that when she took it off, water was dripping out of the cast. We had to go to the emergency room to have her cast cut off. It was a bummer for sure. My doctor said his son went surfing with it and swore by it. Seems to work great for some or not at all for others. I knew that going into it and had hoped for the best."
5,The only way to make mashed potatoes,"This is the ideal way to make perfectly smooth and creamy mashed potatoes. You can make great potatoes the conventional way, but every now and then a lump or two shows up. The Ricer eliminates them completely. Bought this commercial model, because I always buy commercial when it's available."
2,Small potatoes,Product would fine strong construction and stainless steel.Functions what it should.The Big issue is the fact that they have FINGERLING POTATOES pictured on the box.I an a Exec Chef and it is fine for a couples dinner but sad for large production.Picture is misleading and false advertising..
4,A nicer ricer,"This ricer works good for the price.I like lumpless fluffy mashed potatos & this unit really helps to make that happen,but I only gave it a 4 star rating because it doesn't process all the product placed in it in one ricing.Some of the product squeezes between the bucket & the press & doesn't make it through the ricerwhich requires it being re-fed, but that's not a deal breaker."
4,works well,"After reading some of the other negative reviews I wasn't sure about this ricer. I'm glad I got it though! It works really well, we use it with red potatoes so they're not too big. The nice thing about this ricer compared to the traditional round design is that it has lots of surface to rice the potatoes. It was quick and we made short work of 5 pounds of potatoes. The only thing I don't like about it is that if you're not careful the pin holding the parts together might slip out, this happened once for me. Overall it's really easy to assemble/disassemble and clean."
5,GOOD PRODUCT,"SO FAR WORKS VERY WELL HAVE ONLY USED THIS ONCE, SIZE IS VERY GOOD,AND LOOKS VERY NICE,WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE."
4,Works,Would give five stars if the sides were perforated too. just my opinion. Very sturdy - should last a lifetime.
5,Potato Ricer,"I got this for my daughter, the cook. She has fallen in love with this product. Riced pototoes are so much fluffier than mashed. Great product."
5,Lots of interest,Interesting and quirkey. Fun stuff about the oddball cult films that always pop up in conversation. Funny stuff!
5,Great summer read!,"I was attracted to this book after recognizing the author from his movie reviews on the radio. It is the perfect beach companion. I was amazed at the movies Mr. Slifkin included, many obvious selections with new insight. Others were obsure titles that I had all but forgotten seeing. Perhaps best are the movies that I have never seen, but feel compelled to do so after reading this book. Any fan of this era will love this book. In addition it introduces the unique charm of these groovy pics to a whole new audience who weren't even around the first time they hit the screen."
3,LEGO Mindstorms NXT - could have a lot better infrastructure,The basic equipment itself is technically very good.The infrastructure is not so good. LEGO could easily have dozens or even hundreds of projects canned and just waiting for kids to explore. The website that they point to is fragmented and incomplete.There are other LEGO sites that do provide more projects. Good luck finding them! Need parts shown in some of the projects? Good luck finding them too!
3,Great toy but poor service!,My nephew loved the toy. He is 8 yrs old and has attened the mindstorm class held for kids! We were unhappy with the product as one of the motors did not work. We reinstalled everything to make sure that we did not make a mistake! The motor still did not work! So we have asked for a replacement!
3,Mindstorms may be beta for Apple,Product seems exceptional. It does have one major flaw and that is an inability to pair with a mac using bluetooth. The information available in the packaging or the help files with the software don't help or address the problem. At this point I would consider bluetooth on a mac to be usupported and because of the cost of the product this may be enough reason to return. Otherwise a pretty good product but overprice for what may be a beta on the apple system.
4,Vadim,My son loves it. It takes some time to understand and program the robot. Excellent support from Lego. Great birthday present for 10-11 year old.
4,Great Learning product,"My 10 year old daughter took a girls programming class last summer featuring the LEGO Mindstorm. She really enjoyed programming it to perform different functions.The programming is done in a intuitive way using a graphical ""Lego"" snap-together approach. It does require some thinking and a logical approach to be successful."
4,Missing instructions for Robot Alpha Rex,"I recently bought Mindstorms NXT, but i could not find any instruction to build the robot that is displayed on the box (also here on Amazon). Wonder if it was just a sales thing and you canot build it or my box was missing the instruction. I also went to their web site looking for build instruction, but all make that tribot."
5,Robotics NXT,I really like Lego Robotics and belong to a robotics team that competes in tournaments every year.The new robotics kit is great.It gets rid of alot of issues with the old Mindstorms 2.0 that were pretty trivial but did bother my team during competitions.A few of the problems with the new system are that it isn't as simple as the old programing system.It looks like the people at Lego tried to some up with something that looked really robot-ish and looked over a few small details like durability and how well the system might work with children that are old enough to want to do it on their own but don't really think about every little thing before pushing a button and accidently deleting the demo on the brick.All in all it's a pretty cool toy though and it is worth the money.
4,Great Learning Experience,I bought this to use with my 9 year old grandsons. We are having a great time. I was amazed how quickly they started programming--within the first hour. Immediate feedback on their programs really keeps their attention. I did purchase a separate book on programming which was helpful.
5,endless hours of fun,"I bought it back in April this year. I'm very happy with my purchase. Assembling the various models is as easy as playing with regular LEGO and programming is a breeze if you use the visual programming tool that comes with the kit. I, however, prefer using robotC since it gives me much more control and is way more powerful than the visual tool. Its hard to ever get bored with this kit :)"
4,Decent beginner kit,I like this kit for a beginner's kit in robotics. It is much sturdier than others I have looked at. We have bought a couple of others and they have broken too quickly. I just wish MORE came in the kit. You don't get a lot for 250.00. It was definitely a majoy investment. Now we are looking for ways for our son to make alittle extra money snow plowing or mowing to buy more parts.
5,Perfect father and son bonding toy!,The Mindstorm is fantastic! My husband and son play for hours together. My son is learning so much about how programs are used to make something work. This was the best toy purchase I have made in long time. Worth every penny!
5,Excellent gift,Excellent gift for my 10 year-old boy. He's actually learning programming skills. Holds his attention much longer than the typical xmas gift:). Definitely worth the money!
4,Which Witch is Which?,"NOTE: Spanish with English subtitles.A very slick, well conceived tale of love, lust, betrayal and occult payback. Just when you think you've got it all figured out everything changes and you're back to square one. It will keep you guessing to the very end and still surprise you.If that's not enough to peak your interest how about the presence of a beautiful actress like Manuela Acuri (the Moorish girl in 'Mad Love')? She's absolutely gorgeous. So, if you like beautiful women (there are 3 in this movie), imaginative plots and surprise endings this movie is for you!"
3,Spanish Thriller!,"I will not try to get and spoil this too much..but to say is a bit muddled plot, plus the flashbacks, makes this Spanish foreign film, a great way to see how they do it some style. There is nudity, but not too excessive and is a part of the story and plotline, and violence and some modern day visuals to the country of origin, not to mention some[special effects, thought not good!] FX. I recommend seeing this if you have liking to these types of foreign mysteries and like to see the other side. It is subtitled and easy to read and i think is nice way to enjoy a film like this. Cheap enough to invest in MY opinion, and so you can watch it over again and see what you think about the plot and storyline, and more if you have to. So i will give it 3 stars and rewatch it again a few more times just to soak it all in."
4,Care for a little Richard 3rd with your 12th Night?,"When Valentine's father dies, rather than go to her estranged grandparents she prefers to hit the open road (in disguise as a boy, naturally, thus the title) relying on her talent with horses to get by. She winds up working for Diccon Leyburn, an extremely charismatic and feudal-type lord and it is there that our story really begins. While this is the usual girl-disguised-as-boy type romance that we have seen since Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (which is quoted as chapter openers throughout the book), Joan Wolf does a great job re-telling this type of tale. Valentine doesn't lose her sense of humour or, more importantly, her backbone although she has come down with a serious case of hero-worship. Diccon, despite the feudal tendencies and some idiosyncrasies regarding Richard III, can also display quite a sense of humour himself and is more than adequate as our hero. One of my favorite Joan Wolf regencies, I highly recommend this one."
1,What a pile of steaming cow dung!,"This is an awful, awful album I cannot believe how many people are raving on about it. I was expecting Fugazi meets morrisey and got some bad static age era Misfits meets the cramps! This is punk music at its very worse. The vocals for me is what ruins this album, they are so annoying and irratating, that it i like someone scratching their nails down on a chalkboard. Seriously it is a waste of money buying this pile of turgid nonsense. Unique? It's uniquely awful!"
3,PARIS HILTON-THE NAKED TRUTH,IT WAS OK. I DID NOT LEARN ANYTHNG NEW AND I HAVE SEEN MOST OF THE PHOTOS ALREADY IN MAGAZINES.
1,ok,The author hates Paris and says so over and over in this book. It's a waste of time to even try and read this whole book. Read Paris' book instead of this one.
4,Excellent rock from a new Canadian Band,"I just saw the Trews live in concert a couple months back. They ruled. I immediately picked up their CD. It is excellent rock music. None of that new-wave rock or any old-revival rock. This is a ROCK album. Key tracks are ""every inambition"" and ""not ready to go"" (their current single). ""Fleeting trust"" as well has a deadly guitar riff. I expect these guys will be around for a while. They have the talent to anyways."
5,Sultry,Perfect song collection for remembering the good times and those loved ones past and present. The perfect gift for friends who have been supportive and generously shown their love.
5,Been listening to this one for 12 years,"In 1995 I jumped into the backseat of a car. This CD was playing. Lady in the front seat asks the driver who was singing. He replies ""that's Etta James."" She says ""Damn, that's Etta? Yeah, that's back when you heard a woman singing and you knew who was doing the singing.""I bought the CD that very night and have been listening to it constantly from that point on. Even if you're not a Billie Holiday fan or for that matter, an Etta James fan, this one is just a must-have. You won't stop listening."
4,Good,"Printed travel guides have timing problems. Geography stays the same, but quality, prices and street info change. I'm thinking how current material maybe gotten in a more timely fashion."
3,Very shallow,"I have only been to the north hiking. there is not enough information, definitely not for hiking lovers. It lacks hiking descriptions, and whole areas are missing. worst bradet book I've used."
1,The worst travel guide I have ever tried to used,"I am writing this from Albania, where we have been travelling for the past week. We have been extremely disappointed by two aspects of the book: first, the appalling lack of practical information on almost every aspect of travelling (comparing this to any Lonely Planet or Rough Guide); and second, the misleading descriptions of places, especially Korca, which is nothing more than a charmless, cheerless transport hub, and the only place in Albania where we have been hassled. It is described by Gloyer as 'quite the most civilised town in Albania.' It is obvious when one comes to use the book that she has not been to some of the places she mentions, and that for the places she did visit, she did not use public transport. That Bradt should publish such a poor guide is a unfortunate."
2,"Rich on interesting trivia and stories, but thin on practical information","The guide has lots of side stories about history and people. However, the maps are very basic and show things in the wrong locations. Don't depend on the transportation information since most of it had changed since publishing. I ended up getting stuck since some of the bus connections it mentioned don't exist."
3,The first was better,"The second edition isnt fully rewritten, there are a lot of things which changed thence, but arent mentioned. ( Banka e Kursimeve since 2005 is Raiffeisen bank )The style of the second one is for the more stupid travelleres: there is more hotel and restaurant addresses, less history, more advices how to travel by bike and how to tramping, but less about the feeling of the country. And there are a lot of boxes about unimportant english people, who once spent in this country some time, and nothing about the people, who have made more about Albania..."
2,Purists Beware!!!!!,"I just got my blu ray in and popped it in the player, so excited to finally see these wonderful H.G. Lewis films in HD, but to my REAL shock and horror they have cropped the image at the top and bottom for that fake widescreen look and it really effects the picture! The picture IS otherwise brighter and clearer than the previous ""Something Weird"" dvd release but there is just too much cropped off at the top and bottom. For all you H.G. Lewis purists beware!"
5,All out war in Fabletown!,"The most action-packed TPB in the Fables series thus far, MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS gives us what we've all been waiting for: a confrontation between an army of the Adversary and the Fables living in the New World. Violent, bloody, and deadly, this confrontation will satisfy your thirst for action, while providing long-lasting and irrevocable influences on the future of the series. Some characters that are greatly expanded upon here include: Boy Blue, Hobbes, The Beast, Mr. Grumpkin, and the old candy-house witch. Besides the battle and the lead-up to it, this volume chronicles the developing political contest between Old King Cole and the rising star Prince Charming. Some very entertaining and poignant allusions to real world politics included in these parts.I'm not sure if I can say its absolutely the best Fables volume yet, but its certainly up to the same 5-star standard as the others and will not disappoint. Highly recommended."
4,another fantastic installment,"The story continues as the Fables try to deal with keeping their new home safe from the Adversary (the title of this volume gives you a hint what it is) We learn more about the Adversary, and what drove the Fables from their Homelands. Not the whole story, mind you, but enough to keep us interested and wanting for a fifth volume."
3,It All Depends on You Like,"The band it tight, playing top-notch, a professional recording all the way. One caution, however, only buy this album if you like Sam's singing more than his mandolin playing cause there is precious little of that on this CD. What there is, is good of course, but it mostly plays a backup role to his vocals. IMO - If you want to hear an excellent vocalist who also happens to be a supurb mandolinist check out Tim OBrien."
2,Termperature Control is Non-existent,"I have this thermostat in my apartment. Actually it's the PSP511. Not sure what the difference is. This thermostat runs the furnace too long and then it takes too long to turn it on, so it tends to either be too cold or too hot. About the last thing you need in a thermostat."
5,Paz Vega can do almost everything.,"I enjoyed this movie, really, it's part of the human culture, the man feels that the woman is a property, then he can do anything without limits. As humans we should know that every experience is wonderful if we share and make some others happy but with this movie I realiced that human is looking for happines somewhere else.She made me feel that sad and powerless that every abused woman feel all the world arround, not just in Spain, Mexico or America."
5,Simply the best performance of Schubert last sonatas!,"Pollini, one more time is in his best here. Never these works sounds so logical and understable!"
5,I am impressed,"I have to say, I am really impressed with the quality of this TV for the price. It has many features found on much higher priced televisions, yet is very simple to operate. The picture quality is excellent for a tv in this price range and installation onto a wall mount was a breeze. I mounted this tv above the double doors in my bedroom (where I had an electrical and cable outlet installed when we built the house) and it looks great! Very sleek and stylish, I need a new TV for our living room too, and If Poloroid makes a large screen flat screen I will definately look into it as well. Very satisfied here!"
1,Polaroid customer service is the worst!!!,I purchased a Polaroid LCD FLM-373B television 90 days ago and it just went blank. I called customer service and they were absolutely horroble. It's going to take close to a month to repair. DO NOT BUY POLAROID!!!!!
4,"Good TV, bad PC monitor","I did order the 15 Pin VGA M-M cable but the monitor can only work at 800X600 or 640X480. Don't expect too much as having a 20"" PC monitor.Good TV indeed. I have tried out with PS2 and regular cable. It works gret.It doesn't need a TV tuner. Even a 1024X768 TV tuner can't do a better job than a TV itself"
1,Don't even think about it.,I purchased this TV in May of 05. I watched it for two days before it went out. Since it is under warranty the repair shop has had it for a month. Poloroid's customer service stinks. Remember sometimes you get what you pay for and this TV is junk. It is an inferior product.
5,A must-have creative tool,"As everyone already knows, Adobe CS3 is a must-have for creative professionals. This version of Creative Suite lives up to its reputation, providing tons of great new tools. The only problem I have had is the installation of Illustrator - it fails to install successfully."
5,Not plastic and made in USA,I got it to hang in the bathroom over the toilet as fun joke. Give it a try. friends love it
2,Hard to Hang,I bought this for my building dumpster so folks would stop dumping their old mattresses and furniture in or outside of the dumpster. I found the sign hard to hang. I ended up hanging it with metal wire on the chain link fence. The color also faded quickly.
4,"Nice, but...",It is pretty good to have water in a dispenser but after about eight months it starts to leak more and more.
3,great idea,"I love the concept of having water at my desk all day.They recommend you can place bottle in freezer with contents in order to have cold drinks all day. BAD idea. Been using it for 2 months, and it just cracked, water everywhere. Can't seem to find a replacement bottle."
5,Good Item,I put this in my room and find that I drink more water. Its the coolest thing. I love it!!!
1,not worth it,This was a cheap buy and now i know why.....this product leaks so bad!!! Cute idea but not worth it.
2,Leaks,"It leaked the very first time we used it. Thought I had figured it out, had to make sure the button you push to dispense was pulled all the way up. But then the next day his night stand was covered with water."
2,"Great concept, but...","I love the idea of having a mini water cooler on my desk, but the idea seems better than the actual product.1. There is no cooling mechanism so unless you consume a lot in a short amount of time the water will get lukewarm.2. The water lever is a rubber push button that easily gets lodged/leaks. It would be much better if it was a flip lever.3. The water comes out as a slooooow trickle.I have had minimal leaking problems but you have to pay special attention to the rubber stopper to make sure it's in the perfect position to keep the water from leaking. Again, great idea, but not really worth the hassle."
1,water,Cute water dispenser. Fits into small spaces but is not the greatest product. It leaks. Unable to use it.
3,My review,I was exited when I first got it and I could not stop using it but after a week it became booring.And I think that it would be better if you lower the price since its a kid toy and not many kids can afford to buy it for that much money.(...)
4,Good Investment,This cooler serves it purpose. It would be better if it had a side handle but it is very convenient. Makes a perfect gift for someone in the office.
5,Terrific,"Terrific live album of this intractable musician. Iggy Pop can hardly be surpassed in fierceness and intensity. He behaves like a hurt wild animal that has been urged into narrowness and now beats out blindly. Whereas the studio versions of the songs are already quite fast, the pace on these live versions is just breathtaking. I don't want to highlight any single songs. They are all excellent. By the way, on piano is David Bowie who also has written some songs together with Iggy Pop."
1,no good,"The sound quality is horrible. Most of the songs are unlistenable, especially ""Nightclubbing"" and ""Lust for Life"". The two songs that I find enjoyable on this live cd are ""Funtime"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"", but it doesn't even matter because the rest is horrible. I bought this cd on a Friday and I took it to a used cd store on a Sunday. If you want a live Iggy Pop cd, I recommend Sister Midnight. It was recorded on the same tour."
2,yuck,This LP/CD rates just a few notches above a bootleg. I have better bootlegs of this tour. Iggy has been quoted as saying this record was his 'F U' to RCA to fulfill his contract.The songs are great but the production/sound is god awful. My band's practice sounded better than this.It's a fill-in for a catalog item plus with it having Bowie on keys and vocals....I saw this tour in Columbus OH at the Agora--this CD doesn't even come close to the live showBAD BAD BAD2 stars because---1) Iggy Pop------2)the set list
5,Excellent Subwoofer at $105 price level,"I placed an order when the price was $105 last week. I have received the subwoofer on Saturday and immediately hooked up to my Onkyo Receiver(sr606) running bose speakers(301's as mains, VCS-10 as center and 161's as surround). I did not used Y cable but just connected the line level only for left channel. I played Jurrasic Park-1 and man this sub rocks the whole house. I am really impressed with it so far. BTW, the color is black unlike dark blue color you see on the photo."
3,overpriced for its medicore quality,"...Velodyne created this whole VRP line mainly to make money off of its name brand recognition, and cut a lot of corners in the process. The CHT line is far better, for both movies and especially for music.This model was just very weak and underpowered.In this price range you would be better off going with the one hundred twenty five dollar Dayton sub from partsexpress dot com, or save your money for a much better sub from Internet-direct specialty subwoofer manufacturers like SVS and Hsu, who start at around the four hundred dollar range.I personally went cheap on my subwoofer, a JBL e150 for about one hundred seventy shipped new from eBay...talk about buyer's remorse! You do not want to go cheap on your subwoofer, you'll never stop kicking yourself like me."
5,Easy to mount and looks sturdy,"My wife and I have done an extensive amount of research to purchase a wall mount for our 58"" plasma TV to 1) prevent our toddler from turning the TV off or changing the input 2) Space saving. This product was priced right for the width range it provides. Finding a spot so that it can be mounted on 3 wall studs which are 16"" apart was the most challenging part. Once the mount is hooked up to the wall, I attached the TV holds. Then, with the help of my friend, the TV was mounted to the wall. Two painful tasks once the TV is mounted are 1) locking the screws so that the TV holds are tightened and 2) tightening the screw that controls tilt position. I used a power driver to perform the later task. Tilt functionality is very easy to use. I am very satisfied with the product. Unless I write back to this review, assume that TV is still mounted and there are no issues. Go for the product."
5,Great Universal Tilt Wall-Mount,"Purchased this wall mount for my Pioneer 60"" plasma monitor. Holds this monitor with no problem. Tilt also works as described. Great product and customer support. Would recommend."
5,Excellent wall mount,I installed a 52 inch Samsung in my living room. The ST670P Peerless wall mount is very substantial and easy to install. All of the hardware need to complete the installation was in the package.I am very satisfied with the quailty of the product.BGC
5,Best book out there!,"This was by far the best pregnancy book I found. It is very thick and full of great information. The first section goes week by week and explains what is happening to me and to my baby. The second section goes in detail through 1000's of separate topics, including what is happening to my pregnant body in detail, head to toe, what is normal, what isn't, etc. Third section is full of product info and check lists for what to register for, etc. I had at least 4 bookmarks in here at a time because there were so many useful areas for me to check and recheck throughout my pregnancy. If you are searching for detailed and thorough info, this book is your best choice! I recommend it to all of my pregnant friends and have bought the sequel for after the baby is born."
4,Great New Resource for Pregnancy/Childbirth,"As a childbirth educator/doula and trainer for both, I will be referring this spectacular book to my trainees and to all of the expectant families with which I work. Clear and concise, current and objective, this book is the first to contain such complete information!"
4,"Pretty good pregnancy book, probably the best","I can't believe one person called this hard to read. This is the easiest-to-read pregnancy books I've read. The major section covers each week from conception to labor, and there are many drawings of fetal growth as well as tons of practical information on what to expect and what to do each week. Everything is neatly organized and the font is pleasant on the eyes. I find the information complete and for the most part accurate. The only thing I dislike is the book is too thick, with the side effect that it makes pregnancy seem more scary and complicated than it really is."
1,Horrible index,"The index for this book is really bad. I looked up ""spotting"", and it's not there. So I looked up ""bleeding"" and all it has is postpartum bleeding and placenta previa bleeding. I can't find anything about spotting, and there's no way I'm gonna read it cover to cover. But you'd think a book that calls itself ""your all-in-one resource"" would at least make it easy to find a discussion about spotting."
1,Does one really need nail polish at the hospital?,Under the section for packing for the hospital it states one should bring NAIL POLISH!That one line sums up the book. Save your money and get something better.
3,Ok Read,"This is a pretty good book, but some of the information seems either a little out-dated or conflicts with other sources. I like to know what is going on each week, so I read it, but with a grain of salt. I have found on-line sources like Pregnancy Today and Pregnancy Guide Online to be pretty helpful to balance out the information."
4,"Good tape, but watch shipping charges","Just got my order! The tape is VERY black (good for photographic purposes) and very slightly shiny (not so good for photographic purposes). Extreme flat black would be better, but I'll cope. I suspect this tape is as close as one can get to flat black.If you order more than one, watch out for those shipping charges! At the time of my purchase, at least one of the suppliers simply multiplies the shipping fee by the number ordered. *NOT* a good deal, as these will fit several to the smallest shipping box!"
4,Doesn't stick to my waxed car,"I was hoping this tape would be stickier, but it didn't stick to my car finish, so I'm now using it for other purposes. It's pretty decent masking tape in that it doesn't leave much residue, but it is not very sticky."
3,It's great when the magazine stays closed,"This nailer is great, but the magazine that hold the brads opens so easily, that every other nailing it flies open and the nails fall out. I'm hoping I can find a way to get this problem fixed."
1,AVOID AVERATEC!!!,"I bought an Averatec in March of 2004. Eight months later (November 2004) the left hinge broke. Since the laptop was still under warranty you'd think they'd fix it. Instead, I got a lot of runaround from Averatec about how it was ""physical damage"" and therefore 'out of warranty'. They would not admit that it was poorly designed. It cost $130 to get it fixed. Ten months later (September 2005) the exact same thing happened. The left hinge broke. This time they tell me I need a new hard drive, a new wireless card, and a new fan (all of which were working perfectly before it went to Avaratec) for $295.Averatec's products are not merely inexpensive they are CHEAP. Any savings are lost to bogus repair costs."
3,should be returned,"i paid 4 for dis 'round a month ago ,it took nearly 3 weeks before i received it. when i finally could open the box ,i found severe scraches on both the outer covering and the screen,seems it's 'bout crack anytime. i assumed it was a returned one,and just can't stop wonderin' how could they just gimme a thing like da?"
5,Great Stuff - highly recommend!!,This stuff is the best - delicious. And it really tastes like chicken. If you like cup o noodles type foods - this is the healthier better choice. It went over real big with all the kids in the family.Only peeve is it takes about five minutes and that can be an eternity with little kids.
2,"It tastes good, but the portion is so small","I had never been a fan of Fantastic Foods products. I tried the Three Onion Noodle soup cup and it was dreadful, but after I read the 5-star reviews here, I decided to give Fantastic Foods another chance. I ordered a case of 12 of this Vegetarian Chicken Noodle soup cup. The taste of the soup was decent and the ""vegetarian chicken"" had an interesting texture, but the portion was so small that it wouldn't fill the tummy of a small child. Okay, I must admit that I used to eat jumbo size frozen dinners containing a pound of meaty food for lunch, before I became vegetarian, but the miniature portion of this soup cup was ridiculous. Fantastic Foods is now permanently off my shopping list. It had its chances."
1,Not even worth the $26,It was ill fitting and very cheep. Didn't work at all. Several friends tried it and it didn't fit anyone.
3,Gritty adult graphic novel,"This is a gritty adult graphic novel by Paul Pope. Heavy Liquid is a liquid metal that is sought both for its qualities as a potent drug and as a very valuable metal a mysterious benefactor wants to use as a material for sculpture. Interesting concept, but it left me wanting a bit more, just like Heavy Luquid itself."
4,Fascinating and high concept,"If you are looking for a light read, walk away from this page. This is not for you. If you are looking for a trippy and heady GN to wrap your hands around, this is the one, literally. Paul Pope with his completely unique style of art and storytelling, gives the reader an ""experience"". Not just a story to read and see but a real experience. On the flip side, the concoction is truly heady. You might want to put the book aside after reading a bit since the imagery can get to you.Worth a read and buy if you are into ""experiences"" rather than just stories."
5,Love my granddad's book!,"Yes, I am biased. I really enjoyed reading my granddad's book. Partially because it's a bit of family history, but he also wrote it in a very entertaining way. As a child, I remember visiting my grandparent's house and staring at the large world map on the wall with all the pins stuck in it where my grandfather had traveled-- it looked like a giant pin cushion."
4,Works great.,These clips are great for my 100' extension cord and 50' air compressor hose. The only thing that would make them better is if the handle had a little hole or more of a hook shape so it could be hung by the handle. Very easy to open and close.
5,A perennial favorite,"This was one of my favorite books as a little girl, and now my two little nieces can't get enough of it. I'm actually buying a replacement book now because the one we have is so worn out from reading it again and again. I definitely recommend it for the kids in your life."
2,Not as pictured,Very disappointed to receive a bowl that did not have the design pictured. The bowl I received had only a solid blue background without the rainbow colors pictured on the inside. The outside and actual image of the dog was correct. The bottom was also slightly chipped and since there was not any broken off material present in the packaging I believe it was chipped before shipped. Not a good experience with this product.
1,chipped after first week of use,i have bouthg henriksen imports mary naylor's bowls previously. two previous bowls are over three months in daily use with no chips off. this one with the golden retriever started to chip within a week of use. it is only hand washed and the dogs eat out if it and then it is taken away. i am unhappy with this current bowl. the design varies from the picture and it has a thicker rim that seems to chip much easier. can i get a refund? exchange for another one of these bowls as i love the design.
4,Exquisite harmonica work-- features top artists of Brazil!,"I've been having this album for several years and love it. If you like the music of Brazil, this album features several artists from there. Toots is an octogenarian who plays exquisite harmonica. Combined with the other artists, the fabulous sounds of Brazil (including the wonderful Portugese language), make this a great album with a somewhat mellow quality."
1,Design Flaw,"My computer would not Boot with the USB HUB power cord attached and the USB input cord connected. If the power to the Hub is removed, then the computer will Boot. However this gives the computer only a low power output HUB. If you need lots of power from your USB port then you can't use the Hub this way. The only way to use the HUB with my mother board was to power up the computer first and then plug in the DC power plug.I suspect that the DC power cord is feeding power through the circuitry and back into the USB input port and doing bad things to the mother board USB circuit.I have an older computer with one of these HUBS working in it. So my guess is. This USB Hub may or may not work according to the type of mother board you have."
1,4 Port USB Hub Operation,"I found that the only way to use the 4 port usb hub is to power up the computer first, then plug in the 4 port hub in the back of my PC (where the only usb ports exist). This essentially defeats the purpose of trying to make the usb ports available on the front of the PC. If you have had this problem or have any suggestions, please post here. Thanks."
1,i couldn't finish it,This is the worst soup I've ever had. The other reviewers must work for the company because this is abominable. It tastes like a science experiment gone wrong. I'll stick with ramen and cup o noodles for cheap soup (in fact had to get the taste out of my mouth with that).
4,Goat's Head Soup,"First off, let me say I'm not sure if this is their best album. This said, it happens to be the one that I currently listen to the most.Overall, its more subdued than 'Sticky Fingers' and 'Exile On Main Street'. Mick Taylor is featured on guitar, with much accompanying piano and horns(sax & trumpet). Maybe some quiet after the storm."
1,Buyer beware - censored version,"This new 2009 remastered edition has the censored version of 'Star Star.' If you want the uncensored version, seek out the 1994 Virgin edition."
2,"IN RETROSPECT,NOT THAT HORRIBLE","I CLEARLY REMEMBER WHEN THIS ALBUM WAS RELEASED,THE REVIEWS ALL SAID IT WAS A MAJOR LETDOWN FOR THE STONES,BUT LOOKING BACK,IT WAS THE LAST ALBUM THEY DID THAT HAD A ""LAST GASP"" OF TALENT ON IT! IT GETS 2 STARS FOR ANGIE, HEARTBREAKER, AND COMING DOWN AGAIN. EVERY ALBUM AFTER THIS MAKES THIS LOOK SO-SO. THE LAST CUT,STAR STAR, RESORTS TO FOUR LETTER EXPLETIVES, THIS SHOULD HAVE WARNED THE WORLD THAT THIS ALBUM WAS THERE LAST GASP!"
2,Two very good songs but the rest is mediocre,"This album is not under rated. The songs ""Angie"" and ""Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (heartbreaker)"" are very good indeed and might be a reason to get the album, but the rest of the material isn't anything to get excited about. Of course ""Exile on main street"" is a better buy than this one. It's not really bad or really good - it's more or less a decent or average Rolling Stones album that you can either have or lose."
2,2 Stars for a 2 hit wonder,"I have to be brutally honest about this album. Of the 10 songs on the disc only 2 are worth anyones time: ""Silver Train"" and "" Dancin' w/ Mr. D"" ( I guess the D stands for Drac? ). ""Silver Train"" is a good road song while ""Mr.D"" has some great guitar work mainly' in part' thanks to Mick Taylor with Keith. The rest is give and take as far as I am concerned. In 1973 when this album was released I could HEAR that it was near the end for the Stones. When Mick Taylor left after this album, it was "" ALLOVER NOW "" !!!! Buy at your own risk !!!!!"
2,Goat's Head Garbage,"I'll get to the point on this one. The only decent songs are Angie, Heartbreaker, and Star Star. The rest are really bad. Trust me."
3,Coming Down From A Five-Year High,"If not for the commercial success of the ballad ""Angie"", this would probably have been the Stones' most forgettable album, which is somewhat unfair given that the band has previously given us five winners in a row, those being 'Beggar's Bangquet' (1968); 'Let It Bleed' (1969); 'Sticky Fingers' (1971); the two-record 'Exile On Main Street' (1972); and the live chronicle of the late-1969 tour stop at Madison Square Garden contained on 'Get Your Ya-Ya's Out'. By 1973, when GHS was released, the touring and substance used must have taken its toll. There are only three essential songs here: ""Angie"", ""Heartbreaker"", and the Chuck Berry influenced ""Star Star"". The band would not reach another peak until 1978's ""Some Girls"", which brought them a new generation of fans."
3,"Not the Stones' best, but better than I'd remembered it","Goats Head Soup is a very uneven recording, but it's worth adding to your collection. GHS features the Stones' classic, ""Angie"" but there are some lesser known tracks on this recording that are better than I'd remembered: ""Star Star"" is a great tune. The lyrics of this tune (the actual title of which is ""Starf##ker"") are so off-color that they were distorted and obscured when it was originally released in 1973. On the remastered CD, you can hear Mick deliver what amounts to an amusing and fairly pornographic time capsule circa 1973 (complete with references to John Wayne, Steve McQueen, and Ali McGraw). ""Hide Your Love"" is also an outstanding track and it features a couple of really outstanding guitar solos."
5,My least fav of the mick taylor era I love the Mick Taylor,Sure not as good as stickey fingers exile or it's only rock n roll GHS is still ana amazing album with only can you hear the music being a toss my favs are 100 years ago doo... angie and star star but there all pretty good comming down again is great as is winter and slicer train danceing with mr d is ok but nothing special
3,The shark-jumper!,"Wow. I just can't believe this album came after Exile! I guess it kind of makes sense. This album effectively ushered in the 70's version of the Stones- a band that just didn't seem to care ver much anymore. There's a reason why they called their 70's hits collection ""Sucking in the 70's"".Just like ""Some Girls"" and ""I Know It's Only R&R"", this album has some ok moments but overall it's pretty boring. The kind of spark that ignited ""Let It Bleed"" was gone, and the band was just kind of treading water."
2,Two Great Songs,"""Angie"" and ""Heartbreaker"" are brilliant, but every other song is mediocre at best. For those who think the Mick-Taylor-version of the Stones was the best version of the Stones, I wish you the fate of being wrecked on a desert island with only this album to listen to. (Ron Wood rules)."
2,ehh,great album but why i dislikedthe shipping was due to the enclosure. the plastic internal mechanism holding the disk in place was all broken out when i opened the disk for the first time
3,A Smorgasbord Which Yields One Classic,"The sessions which comprised the August 1973 release commenced in 1970 and wrapped up in June 1973. The cornerstone of the 10 tracks is Angie, which is simply one of the best ballads the band ever produced in a studio.But the servings get a bit scimpy after that, with the best of the rest being Dancing with Mr. D, an updated version of the classic, Jumpin' Jack Flash; Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker) - a foray into the cries from the street - and Star Star, a ribald romp into the ""ultimate"" trappings of rock superstardom.With the prodigious output which preceded this release, there was going to be a time where the band would logically take a step back. And with such personal issues as simply finding a studio to record material - Keith Richards was essentially a man without a country around this time - the smorgasbord ends up lukewarm."
3,"Not bad, not good","Regardless of what anyone says about this album, it has ""Winter"", one of the best thing the band ever did. ""Heartbreaker"" and ""Star Star"" are great too, but the rest is filler, albeit filler performed only as the Rolling Stones can."
4,It Holds Its Own,"Maybe this recording is not on the level of the Stones best works(Exile, Sticky Fingers, Ya Ya's, Beggars Banquet), but it does have some prominent high notes. Mick Taylor's guitar playing is very noteworthy as the solos on Silver Train, Hide Your Love, Star Star, and especially the wah wah infected 100 Years Ago really do soar. Angie and Heartbreaker are two strong singles. There are more softer tones on this recording than on Stones albums in the past. Maybe thats why many fans look at this work as dissappointment. However, those with a wider persepctive will find this is a good if not great work by this fab gang."
5,Very Nice.,"If you have yet to hear this one--do so immediately.It is great.Track 2 is a definite highlight.I'm not a damn music critic, but I know good music when I hear it, and this one has it."
5,The Stones made it five in a row,"If the songs on Goat's Head Soup had been released as sides 5 and 6 of Exile on Main Street, they would all be viewed as absolute Stones classics. ""100 Years Ago,"" ""Silver Train,"" and ""Hide Your Love"" are as good as anything on Exile (well, OK, not as good as Stop Breaking Down, but close). There is not a weak song from start to finish. The Stones ""winning streak"" did not stop at four!"
4,"Good album, sad history","This is a very good album, Star Star censored or otherwise. I would give it five stars were it not for the shameful treatment Richards and Jagger handed to the guitar genius behind the album, Mick Taylor. His slide guitar on Winter and work on 100 Years alone make this album well worthwhile. I have been a Stones fan since 1964 and I hope one day Jagger and Richards will have the balls to give credit to Taylor for making this the great album it truly is. And, to refer to Taylor anytime as ""strictly a guest"" as Richards did for the upcoming concerts only shows these old guys still have significant insecurities. For anyone interested in great guitar playing, buy the album."
5,HIDDEN TREASURE,"This album does not share in the limelight of the famous Stones albums such as Exile on Main Street and Sticky Fingers, but to me it may be their best album. 2 of the first 3 songs are some of the most overlooked great songs in classic rock. ""Coming Down Again"" is a beautiful haunting tune sung by Keith Richards with a great sax solo. This may be the best song on the album. The opening 3 songs are then followed by ""Heartbreaker"" and ""Angie"", which to anyone who has listened to classic rock stations over the years, knows are truly great songs. Side 2 of the CD includes ""Winter"" which is almost as good as ""Coming Down Again"" and equally as obscure. This CD has an overall feel that makes the effect greater than the sum of the individual songs. This is what elevates it in my eyes. If you're looking for the famous hits like ""Satisfaction"" or ""Tumbling Dice"", this isn't the CD. If you're looking for a great overall ""feel"", this is second to none."
1,Ignore This Censored Re-Issue,"I recommend against buying this album because the final track, Star Star, has been censored and neutered from it's original version. One can assume that the censorship resulted from an effort to comply with Wal-Mart's language policies (WM is the USA's #1 music retailer). I am a huge fan of the Rolling Stones, and do not blame them in the least; but I'm also a huge fan of Free Speech and Artistic Freedom. Please do not support censorship."
4,Goat P*ss Soup,"Coming after the monumental,yet substance fueled Exile On Main Street,The Rolling Stones notorious excess takes it's toll on GHS.The musicianship suffer ,resulting in the album sounding a bit lazy and winded as well as some songs being sub-par.Only Angie and the underrated Doo Doo Doo(Heartbreaker)stand out as well as Kieth Richard's lament Coming Down Again.Star Star is all hustle and half muscle.Coming after Beggars-Bleed-Sticky-Exile classic album block(All produced by Jimmy Miller, who would bow out after this album),it seemed worse than many made it to be,but GHS would set the tone for future releases to come."
3,who is keith richard,to music fan in boston in the seventies keith took the s off of richards something to do with his dad i believe so there are other albums where his surname is spelled with no s he did put the s back on later after a few years so that is why it is richard and not richards it was not a misprint on the album
3,"Some good songs, but overall satisfactory.","I borrowed Goats Head Soup from my cousin one time. When I finished listen to the recording, I enjoyed some of the songs that were on it. But I did not like most of it. Goats Head Soup is good but it does not rank with Sticky Fingers and Exile On Main St. It ranks below it. The music is laid back and the music does not grip to you. However some songs on the album are really good. Songs like ""Doo Doo Doo Doo (Hearbreaker)"" is a very dark rocker with a lot of horns, ""Angie"" is one of their best ballads and it is well crafted, and ""Star Star"" a Chuck Berry like rocker with its nasty lyrics is close to be a classic stones songs that matched their bad boy reputation. Overall those songs are the highlights but the rest of it sounded very down and unispiring. If you think that this album would be like Sticky Fingers and Exile, you are wrong."
1,Goats Head Mud,"If there was a zero star rating, this release would deserve it. This ""remaster"" is terrible in every way compared to the previous Virgin remasters done by Bob Ludwig. This latest release has had all the dynamic range taken out of it to make it ""iPod ready"". I suspect all the other re-issues are similarly lobotomized. See some technical analysis at, http://www.gearslutz.com/board/mastering-forum/390649-new-umg-rolling-stones-red-book-masters-disappointing.html"
1,The only reason to buy this version...,"The only reason to buy this version is if you want to listen to ""Star Star"" with your preschool kids in the car.Come to think of it, you'd probably be better off listening to the Wiggles."
3,Keith To The Rescue,"It's a funny thing. When the Stones are at their worst, as they are here, Keith always drops a real jem into the album that I can't resist.In this case, it's ""Coming Down Again."" Like all of the album, the lyrics are all over the place, and the guitars are a bit lazy, but the effect is sweeter than anything else on this misguided record.Some of this--""Dancing With Mr. D,"" ""Can You Hear The Music,"" and ""Hide Your Love""--are among the worst recordings of the Stones nearly 40-year career.The fact that a couple of FM-radio staples, ""Angie"" and ""Heartbreaker"" are included doesn't keep this from being a let down of major league proportions.It's unfortunate that ""Star Star"" was saddled with the dirtiest lyric of the 1970s, making it impossible to get it on the radio, because it is the best thing here. Dirty, raucus, and right on the verge of slipping out of control by records end, it perfectly defines the Stones in the mid-1970s."
3,"Regarding ""Star Star""","Another reviewer is right: This disc sucked when it was released, and it still does. If, however, one wants an uncensored version of ""Star Star"" that truly ROCKS, get the one off of ""Love You Live!"""
2,Nice job. Poor packaging.,One of the more underrated Stones records imho. Sounds marginally better than the Virgin remaster.If you are going to ask a fan/sucker to buy a CD a third time why not give an incentive. An LP sleeve? An insert? And extra track? I feel like a sucker.
1,Unsatisfying Remaster.,"I have had all previous versions of this at one time or another. I am not sure if my copy of this is different from others, but my version of star star is not censored. You can clearly hear the word pussy HOWEVER... there is a strange effect placed over top of it. Like a harmony vocal a few seconds behind which tries to BLUR the vocal. I am curious if the people who say their copy is censored are hearing the same thing or is the whole word censored on their copy???"
2,EVERYTHING Melted,"My daughter fell in love with Toffifee while in Germany this past summer. I found it on Amazon, but it was called Toffifay, instead of Toffifee, but made by same company. I decided to take a chance. Luckly it tastes the same. Unfortunately the chocolates did not look the same. I am embarrassed to serve it to anyone but my kids.I'm sure it would have been good if the packaging were better. When I recieved the TWELVE boxes I ordered, every single one of them was completely melted. This was not the candy makers fault, but Amazon's packaging. I gave them packaging feedback, but they have not responded in any way.So, lesson learned: Assuming Amazon will not improve their packaging of meltable food products, ONLY ORDER THIS IN THE WINTER !!"
5,We loved it,While at Disney World's Epcot Park we visited the Germany section in world showcase. We purchased some of this candy there and just loved it. We were so glad to find an outlet to buy this candy and bring a little of Disney back home with us. Thanks so much.
2,A trifle,Williamson seemed to be coasting--just slapping this story together without really putting any serious effort into it. The hackneyed plot was a rehash of the elements of many plots in books I have read over the last 50 years--nothing new or exciting. The characters were never really developed to the point that I cared about what happened to them. Definitely not a page turner.
4,"A little Archaeology, Teleportation and Maybe some Time Travel in one fell Swoop","This book starts off with a great premise of a find in the Saharan desert where the protagonists travel to see what is below the sands. Their discovery leads to a Gate (think of the Sci-Fi movie and TV series Stargate) that allows them to travel among the stars --- and so begins the journey of 4 friends across the Universe.Although I give this book 4 stars for the inventive story and engaging plot, it does get bogged down in what I felt were overly long drawn-out substories on other planets, with the protagonists seemingly unable to move forward very easily. The writing at times seemed to have left out words and the style was more of a conversational one between two people who leave words out because they know what they are saying. Unfortunately to a reader, it seemed difficult at times.Nonetheless, the story kept moving fast enough for me to keep in it and to the finish the book."
1,Must have been written for 14 yr old set...,"I couldn't put this book down - I threw it down. Sorry, I couldn't finish it. The writing style was amateurish and the characters were as dull as a butter knife. There was absolutely no set up - no tension building - no character development, that is except for Ram who was as annoying as he was fakey. I picked this book up because of the authors association with the sci-fi legend Fredrick Pohl. Too bad this book was so stinky as I will probably avoid this author in the future."
4,Flash from the PAst,"This book has the feel of a by-gone era.Jack WIlliamson takes us on a journey through a series of worlds connected once under a great civilization, but struggling to recover from that civilization's failure in the deep recesses of the past.This book could have been considerably longer, but Vance chooses to give us the dime tour of his different worlds, touching on themes like automated environments still running sans people and jungle slaves fighting for freedom against a civilization based on slavery.As usual a very satisfying read."
1,Maybe it's for the juvenile set?,"Maybe I'm too old for Williamson's ""The Stonehenge Gate."" Perhaps it's for juveniles. But, I found the book to be unreadable. Starting with the main characters' response to the initial impetus for the whole book, I started scratching my head and asking why they were behaving this way. Add onto that the really shallow interpersonal relations between these ""close"" friends, and the out-of-the-blue events that push the plot along and the word ""hackneyed"" just springs to mind. If anything, the book reminds me of my old Tom Swift books without the charm. I rate it at a Bad 1 star out of 5."
3,Watered down Williamson,"I read it when it was serialized in Analog. There were flashes of the old williamson, but mostly the characters seemed helpless and were just carried along by events."
1,"Cheap Junk Do not buy , Buy name brand and your better off.","A massive scale of LCD-1700 tv are being sent to repair shops due to the cheap technology and quality Polaroid is making. After manufacture warrantee 1 year, goes out then ur screwd.Buy name brand because its better quality and better tech support. Dont buy what walmart sells basically.Stick to Mitsubishi, Toshiba, Sony."
1,garbage,"I spent hours trying to get this card to work on two separate systems, one with win98, the other xp professional. both machines were freshly formatted and never had a different video card installed.the included drivers AND the newest available drivers on the jaton site were tried. BOTH new and provided drivers caused both PC's to fail to boot...the pc's would restart over and over prompting me to choose 'safe mode'.multiple uninstalls and updated driver installs were attempted, nothing I tried enabled this card to work.The DEFAULT windows drivers (in both xp and win98) allow the card to provide graphics, but you can't use tv-out or (in win98) even adjust the resolution with default drivers.This card will waste a day or more of your time before you give up on it. Don't waste your time or money on this garbage."
4,See this guy LIVE - then you'll understand the album!,"We (all us music consumers) are so used to the model of buying an album and getting to know an artist through their recordings that sometimes it's difficult to think differently about the way we come to understand and appreciate a new artist. For example, I've known of Bruce Cockburn for years and have heard his music here and there, but have only recently become a fan. What did it for me was hearing some of his live shows and getting a sense of the artist's purpose - a feeling of his artistic intent and character. I'd say a new listener of Brent's music would do well to get a feel for his purpose and place. He's a small town talent with global aspirations -- and I say why not! If the ""Next Big Thing is Small"" then here it is people. Buy the record, then come to Vashon Island, WA to see Brent perform up close and personal. You will be assimilated."
5,Fixed my favorite speakers,"We have two thirty year old EPI-180 speakers that were about to hit the dumpster. Several years ago they started to have a vibration at the low frequencies. Like letting air slowly out of a ballon. In desperation I did a search on speaker fix and voila, up same a description of this kit, which could fix my problem. The shipment came on time, with a few catalogs and a nifty screwdriver. Following the instructions, they now sound like brand new. The task took about 2 hours, mostly waiting for the glue to dry between steps. I expect the foam rings to last another thirty years and I will order this kit again. Thanks"
4,Simple but strong,"This book was the second book I read in the area of buddhism, and I really enjoyed it. Maybe because the lessons are practical, and easy to learn. Its also helped me change my frame of mind to a more peaceful one. If you find yourself highlighting parts you like in books of this type, this book is for you. Mainly because a majority of it is excellent quotes by his holiness. I suggest this book to anyone that likes the buddhist way of thinking, or that could just use some simple advice. : - )"
1,"Kenny tried with this cd, but came up empty","As you might know by now, everything in life doesn't always work out. Sometimes in life you will succeed and other times well .... lesser results.In this cds case I really believe that Kenny tried, but didn't succeed. I think part of the problem here was the mesh of the instrumentalist and Kennys' voice. It seems Kenny sang in one key and the musicians played in a different key. There seemed to always be a constant contrast between Kennys' voice and the instruments in the band. The sound they came up with was horrible.I'm not really convinced that Kenny is the ideal ballad singer. Some other venue might suit his voice better. This is just my own opinion, ok!I can not recommend this cd. Better luck next time for Kenny!"
5,Great Product!,"I have been looking for this product for at least 8 months. It had been discontinued...so everyone says. However, I found it today on Amazon. Hallejuah! I am a happy customer and so it my hair!It is great on short hair...just follow directions and look beautiful with great hair!!!!!Thank you"
1,Only compatible with CS100 and CS 200,"Even though this item says it is compatible with S-Series HRMs in the Product description, it is not. The packaging says it is only compatible with CS100 and CS200 HRM Models. I have to return this because of the bad marketing, and I am without a Cadence sensor for the time being."
5,Good quality product,These replacement nipplies are of good quality and a good price for the quantity. I would purchase them again.
4,History of the Non-Commissioned Officer Corps of the Us Army,The book provides good information on the NCO Corps of the Army. I have not found much information from any other source.
3,not very durable,"Product worked great the first couple of time, then it ripped putting it on. Had to use a tire tube patch. For the money it should have been more durable."
1,Too Big,This product was TOO big for my childs arm. I followed and measured but it was not worth it. I sent it backl
3,Product did what it said,"I purchased this product so I could go swimming in Palm Springs with my cast. I did get in the water, but I was so paranoid of water rushing into my waterproof cast I could not enjoy myself."
2,Higher Expectations,"My 4 year old broke his arm so I took all the measurements and according to their website needed the X-Small. Well, first of all to get the thing on it takes two adults to stretch out the opening so my son could get his arm in. Then it was really tight on the top of his arm making it very uncomfortable. The first time he used it, it looked like maybe a little water got in as it was not totally dry on the inside when we took it off. The second time he used it, it looked like air had gotten in, but when we took it off water poured out of it. Needless to say, his cast was soaked. He still has 5 more weeks left so I'm really hoping there won't be a problem because of this. (I read on the internet getting the padding wet underneath a fiberglass cast may cause infections?)"
3,Okay but not super water tight,Maybe the one I have is too small but my cast got a little wet when I used it. It is fine for the shower but I was using it to swim laps and do water aerobics while I am recovering. It is kind of a pain to get the top part to lay flat on your leg and it lost it's suction after about 20 minutes. I am not sure if there is something better out there though.
2,Do some research.,"I bought this cover to replace a Dry Pro cast cover.I have been using a cast cover to cover a diabetic pressure ulcer for over 5 years when I shower.I should have paid more attention to the information about this product. Pictures,descriptions,sizing,packaging,and style numbers are very similar to the Dry Pro cover.My old Dry pro lasted for 5 years before it became unusable. This cover is of a lesser quality.The rubber used is thinner and sticks to your skin its only redeeming point is it is stretchier than the Dry Pro product.If you are looking for a waterproof cover buy the Dry Pro it is a vastly superior cover.Any unkind remarks I have made in past reviews are my fault and not the sellers fault."
5,Xerosox a blessing,I had double (bilateral) total knee replacement recently. I knew from a lesser surgery that not being able to shower made me so much more miserable. The Full Leg Xerosox fit up over my incisions. I could sit on my tub bench and use the faucet hose to shower my hair and whole body right after getting home from the hospital. Not a drop of water got in. This was such a lift to my spirits. You do need to turn them inside out after the shower so they dry on the inside and don't start breeding bacteria. This was easy to do. I just draped them over the shower stool. My incisions healed without infection. I highly recommend this product.
1,Very difficult to get cover over cast,"Trying to get the Dry Pro medium full arm cover on my son's cast was very difficult - even though it was the right size according to measurements. Cramming his cast little by little into the cover took a very long time compared to the quick-n-easy video demonstration I'd watched online. The video demonstration was done on someone with a short cast that did not extend beyond the elbow like my son's. In addition I really scraped up my knuckles against the cast each time I wrestled the cover on him. I couldn't think of a way to avoid doing that since the cover is so snug and does not stretch easily. Once the cover was on, it did a good job keeping the cast dry - however it was such a hassle to get on him that I went to using a plastic garbage sack and a rubber band at the top instead. That worked well for taking a shower though I wouldn't trust it for swimming or a bath."
1,Do Not Buy the Kindle Version!!!,"Is this a publisher problem or an Amazon problem? There are no illustrations in the Kindle version. Where each illustration is supposed to be is an infuriating sign: [To view this image, refer to the print version of this title.]Well, darn! If I'd known they didn't have the whole book, I wouldn't have paid $12.37 for what I thought was the whole book!This is fraud, obviously, and Amazon should withdraw this book from electronic distribution."
5,It Works!,"I have known and worked with Josh Costell for several years and believe he understands the real world of selling as well as anyone. He takes a very practical, understandable approach to selling that can easily be applied to a broad range of selling situations. Applying his principles and insights will make you more successful. Great stuff!!"
2,measuring dollars,"The book is quite interesting and motivating, although I found the technique put forward by Costell very money oriented. If your high-tech product doesn't show a clear dollar saving for the client (i.e. it is for research purposes), the method will be hard to implement."
4,nice socket,"this socket is very nice, decent price and quick shipping. Klein makes a nice product that people should not be afraid to buy. Buy with confidence"
5,Being aware of the world we live in,"Being new to the surroundings of water, Alison's book opens your eyes to the beauty of the ocean and all the animals in our world. Her stories from child to adulthood are witty and fun.From the loss of a close friend how the ocean and all its creatures can be a place of healing, peace and joy."
2,3 inches by 3 inches? Those Are Some TINY Rulers You're Using...,"This box is NOT 3 x 3 x 4.5More like 4 x 2.5 x 3.5Look at it this way, at one end of the box, I can stand an individually wrapped Tea Bag on its end and the box is almost to short for it. It fits snug."
2,Motorola Surfboard SB5100 Cable Modem,"The product arrived in good shaped. Added the MAC ID of the device by calling Comcast, but after that internet never worked. After some calls to the customer care they declared the product to be defective :-("
3,blue tooth adapter,"The instructions for loading the driver for the device were incorrect and I had to call tech support. Tech support had me go to their site and download more currect drivers. Once this was corrected the device works and I was able to link to my blue tooth devices. However, if you want to transfer files from a blue tooth phone or other device more software is needed to facilitate the transfer. This software can be obtained (at a cost) from the device manufacturer."
3,Flashing Power Light,"My brand new SB5100 didn't work. With just its power cord hooked up, the power light was flashing on and off. Turns out this means the modem is bad. So I'm returning it for a replacement."
1,My surfboard modem has crapped out,"unable to obtain ip address from dhcp server after only 1 month. Lights stay on and appear to work. Have tried 3 nic cards, 2 computers and 1 usb. no luck, using adelphia powerlink."
1,What cable modem?,"I ordered a cable modem, I received a grapefruiter instead...a tool to section grapefruit. Not even close...."
1,MODEM,"IN SPITE OF TRYING FOR AN HOUR OR SO, AND IN SPITE OF HAVNG MY SON-IN-LAW, A PHYSICS TEACHER, TRY THE INSTALLATION FOR 2 HOURS, INCLUDING A CALL TO COMCAST,WE COULD NOT MAKE THE MODEM WORK.I AM NOT SURE WHETHER IT IS THE MODEM OR THE USER.GOOD LUCK."
3,modem,Simply stated the modem didn't work with my computer system setup. I have been unaable to ascertain the reason for the failure
2,:(,I thought it would work with my laptop but it was a fail. I wanted to have wifi for my phones xbox and laptop.
5,"Rock solid, flawless performance.","This is a great cable modem at a VERY good price... The install was as simple as hooking up the Ethernet cable, the coax and power then calling my ISP to have the modem provisioned. The connection has been rock solid since and the preformance flawless since install. The design is nice with a small footprint and the ""standby"" button is a nice feature if your concerned about hackers or other outside intrusion. With DOCSIS 2.0 (and backward compatibility) built in, this modem is ready for any future upgrades by my ISP. I highly recommend purchasing this modem if your in the market for one."
1,bad product and misrepresented,"The item was described as ""mint"" condition. It was not. When it arrived it was packaged as new, but the router label was cut and the router was opened for some reason. The screw used to re-close it was not original. I could not get it to work because Comcast said it was still assigned to another customer. Comcast technician also was unable to get it to work and said it was defective. Cannot recommend this seller at all."
2,It doesn't meet the requirement by my provider. I had to return it for another model (SB5110).,"I shopped for a SB5110 and I never wanted a SB5100. But, somehow, I ended up buying this model. I wish I had not made such a mistake."
1,outrageous price for sb5100,"the average going price for this product is $50.-$60. the price quoted herein of $600. is so far beyond what might be considerable reasonable it's ludicrous. doesn't Amazon have any standards for their third party vendors? whether or not you disclaim responsibility for third party suppliers, they do appear on Amazon's web site, and nothing will prevent Amazon from being associated with such chicanery. allowing such postings is unworthy of Amazon. for a number of years i have held an equity position in Amazon, and fully understand, and generally approve of using additional sources for products your customers want, and i do understand the meaning of caveat emptor, but this is an embarrassment."
5,Awesome Product,"I am a New Comcast customer and I was not aware that they charge a $7 a month rental fee this very same cable modem.So, I ordered this one off Amazon... Got it in about a weeks time. Got it all connected and set up... And it's works BEAUTIFULLY! No problems at all. :)I paid about $19 for this modem ( shipping/handling and tax ) and now I get to same money off my Internet bill every. AWESOME!"
3,Was great for a year and then....,"Like other reviwers stated, works fine for awhile then gradually gets worse and worse. After about 1 year mine had trouble connecting all the time. Now I've switched it out I've had no problems connecting since."
3,Old Unreliable...,"I don't know if it's my modem or my ISP...but for some reason my Internet connection keeps getting lost. I've had this modem for about a year now and most of the time it does what it's supposed to do. Every now and then, however--sometimes for a day and sometimes for weeks--it loses its commnection. Then I have to unplug it, reset it, plug it back in...see if it works.... If it doesn't, I have to do it again...maybe call my ISP on the phone....I get a lot of downtime when I should be online and productive. Shop around. I figure there must be something more reliable than this out there."
5,It's just so easy!,"It's the easiest installation I've ever done. The only thing it doesn't tell you is that you need to have just about every protocol there is installed already for the connection to work. Nevertheless, it's just awesome. GET IT IF YOU WANT A SOLID CONNECTION! :-D"
1,Arrived broken,"It was described as refurbished but it was simply re-packaged. The Ethernet activity light never came on so I presume there was a problem in the circuit board. It's annoying that someone would send a defective unit, call it refurbished and then I had to go through the trouble of returning it at my own expense."
5,Modem,"I had no issues with the modem so far, after about 1.5 years of using it. I have replaced the one from Comcast with it and avoided paying the $5 per month. The modem paid for itself already, I am making money now."
4,great,"received product on time,but needed to purchase a new ethernet cord because the one they sent did not work but the modem works fine."
5,SB5100 Cable Modem,"I was a little scared to buy a used product. However, I couldn't be happier. Looks basically new and works great!"
2,Inadequate,"This product does not work properly. I have to reboot the modem at least 2-3X a day as the connection is constantly lost. It was cheap, but still a waste of my money."
4,Broadband Wired Down,"With the use of cable modems becoming more & more like a entity, many of us try to go to a cable provider for that aid. Nevertheless, it works very well. With Motorola'a Surfboard modem, that isn't as much of a problem. It is very convient to operate, and simple to install for the feeling of broadband service through your phone lines, and cable high speed service. You can simply install it into the back of your computer, and just surf to your little away. I like it because it works well with my optimum service, and it is convient. It is a absolutely good modem, at a affordable price.Price: BEffecieny: B+"
5,MOTOROLA surfboard cable modem,"Length:: 0:33 MinsMotorola Surfboard SB5100 is what you expect from a company like Motorola. Was easy to setup, works flawlessly and fast."
1,don't waste your time or money! TWC customers don't buy!,I bought this from amazon.com full filled by amazon. to find out some how the unit is damaged or It will not work with Time Warner Cable after giving the rep both the mac and the usb mac address i could not get the unit to power on the rep told me on the phone most likely the unit is damaged because everything is OK in her system. So don't waste your time or money with this it plain don't work according to Time Warner Cable of NC. ordered 11/03/2010 got 11/10/2010 DOA power and PC is the only light that will power on.
1,Buggy Firmware! Upload Rate Caps To 1/3 Of Max Upload Rate!!,"SB5100 has buggy firmware, especially for v1.1.1.1. There is not way to upgrade your firmware for this modem on your own. You have to get your ISP to ""push"" the new firmware. But ISP will refuse to do so on one on one basis.So now, my upload speed is capped down to 1/3 of what the max upload rate should be. Go to Comcast forum in www.dslreports.com, and you will find that SB5100 has a lot of problems and a lot of people complain about it.Don't buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Modem works as expected! Who still wants to lease one from Time Warner?,"I have been using the Road Runner internet service from Time Warner Cable for quite a while. To my surprise, TWC has decided to charge the modem lease fee since October for $3.95 per month. I don't want to pay this fee, so I decided to purchase this modem. It works will with my internet service, with 22Mb downloading rate and 1Mb uploading. Let's do the math: this modem costs $17.75, which pays off itself after four months. After that you have this modem and don't need to pay TWC any more. So, who still wants to lease one from TWC?"
1,Motorola Surfboard SB5100 Cable Modem,This item arrived without a 12V DC power converter. The fact that the converter was not included may have been stated somewhere in the fine print but I could not find that info. After I hooked up the modem up the internet signal would frequently drop off. I have since received a new modem as part of the internet signup deal and have replaced this useless Motorola Surfboard SB5100 Cable Modem I ordered from Amazon with the new modem. The new modem works fine. No more signal interruption. It feels like whoever sent the modem kept the converter and got a new modem and just sold off the faulty one.
3,had to be replaced,"i had this modem for about 9 months and for the first 8 months it ran perfectly. unfortunately, it gradually became harder and harder to get online. it took longer and longer to connect and it kept dropping the connection while i was online. at first, i thought it was just Comcast having problems or maybe it was my computer. I switched the computer and called Comcast but still ended up with the same problems. it was the modem that was the problem. i didn't have any problem with Comcast replacing it for free though. they gave me a Scientific-Atlanta Inc. modem, so time will tell if this one does the same. don't worry though if you had bought one. Comcast knows about this problem and they will swap out your modem no problem."
5,"No signal drops, Very Solid modem","Excellent cable modem. I am very much a Linksys fan and bought their cable modem to go with my router and wireless access point. After numerous problems I checked the reviews to find a better cable modem. Excellent reviews led me to the surfboard.I switched to the Surfboard and have had excellent results. No lockups, no signal drops, everything works great. It also works just fine with all of my other Linksys routing equipment.If you are having connection drops or other issues with your current cable modem, this one is worth a try. It solved all of the issues I had with my previous cable modem. Does very good with online games as well.I am using it with Charter Communications."
5,Lookin' good!,"I bought this cable modem so I could save on the rental fees from Cox (San Diego). I was renting an older Toshiba model that I had no complaints with. When I connected my new Motorola this morning (after contacting Cox with the Mac Address and serial # of the new modem), I tested out the bandwidth. Wow, I got a download at a faster speed than I have ever seen with the Toshiba modem. It looks like this modem is going to work out great for me. The reason I decided on this model instead of a newer Toshiba model was the price. This modem was cheaper. It looks like I made the right decision."
5,Great modem,I bought this modem to replace a Motorola 4200 rental from Comcast. Once Comcast registered the modem it connected instantly. Not one problem with ths modem yet. This standby button is a nice feature.
5,No Problems Worked Right Out of the Box,"Purchased a used one for a deep discount, worked right away no issues. Better than paying Time Warner the lease fee every month."
2,Modem works great but ......,This modem was purchased through Amazon and fulfilled by SSDEALS. The intent was to replace a rented modem from Comcast.Installation was a breeze and I was up and running in no time. The problem was that this was a used modem and Comcast claims they have the MAC address registered and claim it is their modem and refused to remove the monthly rental fee. After many calls to Comcast I still have not been able to resolve the issue. I may have to return this or eat the cost and buy a more costly modem at a retail outlet to solve my original issue.
4,modem,the modem was simple to set up and is easy to use. I got it because it was reasonably priced and a comcast approved modem. I needed it for cable internet/tv from comcast
5,Great!,"Works for me! I use it every day. Using it right now, as a matter of fact. The price was great and delivery was just as stated. No complaints at all."
3,Not for Even Moderately Fast Connections,"The supplier has great customer service and the modem works fine but I would not recommend this product for anything above your very basic <10 Mbps connection. I have a 15 Mbps connection and stream Netflix very often. The modem I was renting from WOW played Netflix beautifully over this connection (believe it or not). I bought this so that I could return the WOW modem and save the $5 a month on equipment rental but I immediately noticed that Netflix looked terrible over this modem. I did not do a speed test, but there is no way it could have been running the full 15 Mbps, let alone the quoted max of 30 Mbps. Had to return it and buy a new modem from best buy.This is a fine purchase if you have a very slow connection and never stream content. Otherwise, stay away."
1,modem on/off,"works for a few hours, than kicks off wifi and you have to reset to get it to work again. not worth the money even if it was free."
3,Fine product mine did not work,Be careful when buying a DSL or Cable modem usually it depends on the ISP and most of them want to rent you their modem and will not help you chose the right one.
5,Why pay rental fees?,Item arrived on time and in great condition. Have been using it for a few weeks now and have had absolutely no issues. In two more months it will have paid for itself. Sure beats a $7 monthly rental fee! Wish I had done this years ago.
2,Not compatible with wireless router,"The modem was advertised to be truely plug and play and it is to a certain extent. I purchased this for my parents who are not computer savy. The modem works, however we were unable to get it to work with the wireless router that they have (NetGear)."
5,Arrived early and easy to install,"This product arrived early and was very easy to install. Called Comcast, who asked where I got it, told them Amazon. Now $7 less on my bill."
1,Doesn't work,"We ordered this to save a few bucks on our monthly Internet service bill, and it doesn't work. The technician who set our Internet up even tried to get it to work with no success, and even called out a second technician who verified that it was inoperable. Total waste of my money and our provider's time."
3,"Fair item, no problems",This one works better than the same exact model of it that I had from Comcast.
2,slow....,"I received this item in a timely fashion but w/no cd. i couldn't get onto my own home network and the speed was super-slow, like dial-up. i suppose if the cd had been delivered with it, it would have worked better..."
3,Motoro;a Surfboard,"I don't no if it will work or not,because comcast messed up the activation process and I haven't been able to use it"
3,Motorola Surf Board modem,"The shipment was pretty fast and the product works fine and I haven't had any problems with it at this point. The only complaint that I have is that when the product arrived it was supposed to be in excellent condition as stated on the ad for the product, I knew that it was used and knew that there would be a possibility that the product would be damaged but when it said excellent I expected excellent and there was a crack on the top of the modem, and I can hear something rattling around inside of the modem. But anyways the product works and I am happy with it."
2,Good product - bad service,I have the modem and it works okay - I ran into a problem with the ethernet port when I attempted to hook up to my wireless network at home and could not get support for the product from Motorola - I went round and round with their auto-email and finally gave up - they seem to have little interest in resolving actually comsumer problems
2,Short life-span,"I've had this modem for about 2 years, and it worked fine until about a month ago. Now, at random times, it loses it's connection to the internet and must be rebooted to get it working again. This happens at least once a day. I had a Motorola modem previously, and it also died after a couple of years. Perhaps my expectations are unrealistic, but I expect more than 2 years service from a modem. I'm replacing it with a Linksys CM100."
1,this modem doesn't support Comcast any more,"it worked fine in the first couple months around Oct. Nov.2011. However, my internet started to have some problems. Comcast said they cannot get the signal from this modem and their technician couldn't solve the problem. Until I called Motorola, I just realized this ""Motorola Surfboard SB5100 Cable Modem"" is no longer support Comcast internet. The only thing they can do is suggest me to get a new modem. That's true. I rent a modem from Comcast and my internet works very good now. So, I just waste my money to buy this old modem for using just couple months. And after I figured out what's wrong with my internet service,the modem I bought here cannot be full returned now."
2,Won't stay connected for very long!,"When I received this modem, the box said ""Always On, Always Connected."" Unfortunately, this hasn't been my experience with this product. I've had to reset this thing at least twice a day for a week now (sometimes more). When it's on the performance is great, but eventually it will just stop responding and I have to reset it."
5,Hyperborea is Overall Quite Good,"Hyperborea came out in 1983, but it's hard to tell, given the timeless electronic instrumentation. From the first mesmerizing cut called No Man's Land, to the pulsating Cinnamon Road, throughout the rest of the album, Hyperborea offers something just a little bit different. With each listening, you hear something new and appealing. If you liked Force Majeure and Ricochet, you'll like this undertaking as well."
3,Soundtrack music,"This album features some nice soundscapes and good production, but sections have an unreal plastic feel like Exit, but on slightly longer tracks. They grooves are ok but they go one a bit long sometimes. Good background or soundtrack stuff, not too spacey. Actually 3.5 stars."
2,Not Their Best,"I compose and perform my own electronic music, have beenan avid TD fan since late 1980, and own just about all of their 70-plus albums.When Force Majuere and Tangram came out in '79 and '80 respectively, they were in my opinion, at their very best. Structure and melody were at the forefront. I loved White Eagle and LOGOS, and then came Hyperborea. TREMENDOUS LET DOWN.The title track is this album's one saving grace. The BRAIN-POUNDING bassline of ""Cinnamon Road"" seems to be way out of proportion. The remaining selections just meander around with no real purpose. There are plenty of sound textures, but sound textures alone do not a good album make.The true disappointment for me is that the music itself is TERRIBLY lacking. There are almost no coherent melodies, and I find the sound textures to be very EXPERIMENTAL. Personally, I think they should leave their experiments to themselves."
2,Hyperborea 2008,Very disappointing! See my review of Tangram 2008 - all the same complaints... why take a classic album like the original HYPERBOREA and redo it in the most banal and uninteresting way imaginable?
1,Not much of a KNIFE,"This is another made in Pakistan knife. Although many of the knives coming out Pakistan are improving all the time, I cant say that about this one. You see the handle referred to as ""composite"" or ""Imitation Stag"" but basically it is a light weight plastic. The pins in the handle stick out about an 8th of an inch on each side. Get it near a heat source and the plastic handle will go up in flames quickly. The brass guard had a sharper edge than the blade which has no edge on it to speak of. In order to make this piece of metal function as a knife of sorts, you will need a good file to sharpen the blade, take the sharp edges off the guard and file down the grip pins. Basically worthless as a knife."
1,Horrible product and even more horrible company!,"I can't even begin to describe what a horrible experience it was with this product. In the first place, it is advertised as a small arm, but it should be stated as a toddler arm. So you open the package, find out you've been completely duped, call to return it, and the company responded, ""I am sorry the product is not returnable when oped, it hygenic in nature and single patient use, I am sure you would not want to purchase a used one."" So their insanely defective product is not returnable. BIGGEST RIP-OFF EVER!"
3,Still too big,even the xtra small was too large for my daughter. I'm sure if it was smaller it would have been great.
4,Great New Orleans experience!!!,"This is a great album,specially enriched with the marvellous participation of Jon Cleary,for me,one of the best piano players of ever.Really a participation of any Louisiana's piano player is a great thing for a good blues album!!!Specially some musicians like Jon Cleary,Dr.John,and Professor Longhair... This is a very true experience of this great bluesman,Taj Mahal,with guest appearances of Eric Clapton and Bonnie Raitt.I really loved the first track,an original of Taj's style.All of the others are pure Louisiana blues,and i really recomend to the bluesfans all over the world to listen this fantastic, Jon Cleary. He's a bluesman unrecognized,that deserves an accurated listened from those that really loves good music.You must try to listen the other Cleary's works such ""Alligator Lips and Dirty Rice"" and recently ""Moonburn"".What we can say is that Taj worked right to choose those great musicians and the results, are all inside this great cd!!!"
3,Enthralling opener but by-and-large a tame effort for Taj.,"There is certainly nothing wrong with this album, everything is done quite well. It's just that once you've listened to Taj enough, you get to start expecting the unexpected, and this album is as straight-forward as I've heard him play. ""Lovin' in My Baby's Eyes"" is an absolutely beautiful and highly emotional original. If you don't get shivers after listening to that one, you best pick up a new hobby. After that though, it's surprisingly simple blues. Nothing wrong with any of the tracks, but it's just not very adventurous."
2,Not your typical taj blues,"I'm a big big Taj fan. Unfortunately, this album wasn't quite what I was expecting. This is a considerable departure from a typical Taj blues album. A couple good tracks though."
5,This music makes you MOVE,"This album ROCKED me all the way through the PORTLAND MARATHON last year. I LOVE it, and I'm not what you would consider a young person! To me, it's inspirational!"
2,Entertaining but cheesy techno,"First off, I'm not a gamer - maybe I'd like this album more if I'd spent more hours playing Mortal Kombat. Dunno. With that in mind...I picked this up after I found out that all the music was composed and performed by Praga Khan, the man behind the Lords of Acid. While it's not exactly bad, it certainly doesn't live up to the strenght of most of his solo work or his LoA releases. Very standard early-ninties cheesy techno that's well produced, but ultimately uninspired."
3,Good Fightin' Muzak,"I bought this CD right before I saw ""X-Men"" in the movie theater. I had downloaded an MP3 of ""Go Go Go (Sonya)"" a while earlier, and I loved it, so I decided to buy the album and have all the songs. The 10 songs on this album range from okay to good to great. My favorite tracks are Sonya, Raiden, Kano, and Johnny Cage. The Mortal Kombat theme is great fighting / dancing music, and, despite not having much in the way of lyrics, is fun. Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Liu Kang, Goro, and the other mix of the MK theme (Track 10) are pretty blah. They could've recorded a song for Shang Tsung, but they didn't. Sonya's song will always be my favorite. In fact, I just created a remix of it last night, and it's available for download on WinMX and Morpheus. Overall, this is a good album - good for raves, good for exercises, good for a rush of adrenaline."

The only way this book would be useful is if you are a TOTAL beginner webmaster, and even then there are better books out there."
3,Not as useful as I thought it would be!,"The author misses lots of fundamentals...This is more a book of ideas than anything practical and useful. Worse, I followed the author's advice every step of the way yet saw little results. My sites hits didn't really increase over the long haul"

1,Completely Obsolete,"I read this book at a bookstore and couldn't believe that it's still being sold. Just look at the publication date. The book was probably written in 1995 and the Internet was a very different place back then. The only section that is still valid is a brief few pages about the search engine. However, much better information is available at SearchEngineWatch."
2,Hardly THE definitive guide,"With 200 pages of mostly verbage this is hardly the definitive guide to promoting your Web site. Seller's mostlly covers common sense items that just about every publisher out there has already tried. A lot of the suggestions are as simple as you should register with search engines.

2,"Package was already opened, otherwise ok","This battery is an exact replacement for my Panasonic phone. I was very disappointed to see that Amazon (not a reseller) sent a battery with packaging already neatly sliced open. The battery came right out. So far the battery works fine but I don't know how long it will last or its prior history. It's not worth the effort and expense to send it back so I'll live with it, but not pleased with the experience."
5,panasonic pp104A,"Before I purchased this product, I wanted ,above all to make sure it was the correct battery for my Panasonic cordless phone. The model numbers given were very helpful. The photos aslo helped...The batteries were shipped very quickly and were installed in a minute..My phones are now fully charged and working well.I would recommend Amazon and Etronic..."
4,Replacement Battery for Panasonic Cordless Phone,"This Panasonic brand replacement is great - works just like the original. This company shipped promptly and had a very reasonable price. I've tried several non-Panasonic brand replacement batteries for my Panasonic multi handset system, and they have not been reliable."
5,My beloved phone works again!,"My beloved Panasonic cordless phone after many years of service finally quit holding its charge and would black out completely after less than a minute of call time.This battery is an identical replacement to the battery that came with my phone. I wanted to stick with OEM Panasonic, since the original battery lasted several years without any hiccups.After charging overnight with the new battery, my beloved phone is back to its old self. I'm happy to have my workhorse back in operation."
3,Works okay,"Though it works fine in my phones, it doesn't seem to hold the charge as long as my original Panasonic battery that came with the phone. It was still much cheaper than anything available anywhere else. The lowest price I could find locally was $20! If I wanted to pay that much I'd just buy a whole new phone system."
5,Perfect replacement.,"I bought two of these Panasonic Ni-MH Type 29 batteries to replace two (very) old batteries in my cordless telephones. They were delivered promptly, hold a charge and are identical replacement batteries. 'Nuff said."
5,Great Batteries,"I was able to order, receive and use four of these rechargeable batteries instantly. No complaints. It was a great experience,seamless."
4,work well,"this battery works well up to now. My wife can talk with her friends much longer, not need worry it will shut down in the middle. But the price is a little bit high."
5,Panasonic HHR-P104A/1B Ni-MH Type 29 Battery,"The first battery lasted for 3 or 4 years, it was replaced with a non-Panasonic brand battery from Radio Shack which only lasted for about 1 year. Going back to the Panasonic battery! Hopefully this one will last a long time too."
4,a good replmt oem battery,Makes the phone like new in terms of talk time before recharge. Avoid aftermarket battery's on this one as they all seem deficient.
5,Quick delivery,The two sets came fully charged. I won't know until sometime in the future whether they keep a charge longer and if they recharge to 100%.
5,"Original battery, worked perfectly","I have a set of 3 Panasonic phones that all needed replacement batteries. I tried buying a cheaper 3rd party batteries and only one of the four I bought (I had to buy 2 at a time) could hold a charge over 5 minutes of talk time. Needless to say I was not happy with my purchase, so I spent the extra money on the real deal and bought the Panasonic label batteries, and my phones are like new again. You get what you pay for, and this was worth it."
1,Panasonic Battery,This item would not charged. End up at Walmart getting one that worked. Guess I got what I paid for. Not worth my time sending it back. Lesson learned.
1,I got burn,"I ordered 2 batteries and they sent me junk ,and the worts part no one did nothing about it.the seller and amazon.com just ingnor it ,they don't take care the costumers,so you want to buy something from this company don't do it.because if the product is defect or no good you will be stock with it.it happen to me with this panasonic NI-MH type 29. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY"
5,Works like new,"I got this batteries after my panasonic house ph started acting funny, this batteries work just like the ones that the ph came with, I had them for more than a year and no problems at all, I will buy if I need to again."
4,"Works well, good price",Have only used these for about 3 months so I can't make any statements about long term but sofoar they do exactly what I expect them to. they are used in a cordless phone.
5,Gets the job done..,Replaced the battery on my cordless Panasonic phone. Old one just would not charge anymore - Lasted ~2 years.
5,"Great price, Great product!","I am very happy with the batteries I purchased. The price was better than local stores, and they have worked perfectly. I could not ask for anything better."
4,Replacement Battery for phone,This is a good deal. I received product same date that they said. The package is in original condition. The seller is a good company and trust worthy. Return policy is nice also. I recomand other to buy from this seller and via this web site.
5,Delivered as Promised and Beyond,"Greetings to ALL:I checked my existing Battery in my Cordless phone for the replacement. Then I checked the Manufacturer parts and cost. Then I searched for the same battery but for less. I found it in our local electronic stores but was double than the Amazon.com vendor. The price was right. Instead of ordering one battery, I ordered TWO since I have two cordless phones but one unit needs battery replacement. They arrived within reasonable time and they were exactly as ordered. I would certainly do more business through Amazon generally but will do more orders through the same vendor."
4,It works,Well not much to say about a battery more than it works. Does its job and quite well. Just as the original.
4,Another great Panasonic product.,"Definitely choose this product because of price after installing have not had a problem since,I would say to anybody there is know need to go elsewhere."
5,Batteries work as they should.,These batteries work as they are supposed to. My old batteries were giving out and the replacements came in a very timely manner and fit the hand sets perfectly.
5,Batteries work great,"Batteries work great in both of our phones. No problems, and we don't need new phones. Price was reasonable."
5,Great price,I bought this battery for my favorite homephone. it is working great thanks for selling it here. i was looking for this battery everywhere. i didnt find panasonic . i had to buy another phone i thought i will never find it. And i got it so so fast. I could'nt believe it. thanks for a great job.
5,cordless phone battery,"Very satisfied with the battery, quick delivery from the seller. Battery life well is as good as could be expected it performs as new, but my phone even when new didnt have an exceptional battery life :s But as long as the battery keeps workin as good as is I am happy with it."
5,Excellent Genuine Panasonic Battery,"Good deal. These batteries were genuine OEM Panasonic batteries for significantly off the street price. They work as new in my Panasonic cordless phones, since they are the original OEM batteries. I bought a case of them (six pack) since we have three phones (two extension phones) in our household. I should be all set for life!"
5,Phone Battery Replacement,From the information provided it was easy to determine that this was an exact replacement for the cordless phone battery--and in addition at a good price!
4,Panasonic Phone Battery,I do not know how many people throw their old phones out due to the batteries failing. I suspect it is quite a few. I am now on my third set of batteries with my Panasonic KX-TGA542M phone system. I have tried to replace the phone system on more than one occasion and found the new phone did not work as well as the old. So cheaper to replace the batteries.
5,Works as promised,I have tried off-brand replacement batteries in the past and they never seem to hold a charge or last as long as original part replacement.These batteries have made my phone work like new. I would recommend spend the extra dollars and ALWAYS buy original name replacement batteries.
5,Quality Product giving reliable-GREAT service!!,"Bought this brand name, meaning with PANASONIC name on it ... working GREAT. Non-name product bought an year go was DUD. That battery lasted less than one-month. Ask-&-Rely on Brand-Name product."
5,Worked just like the original,"The phone was shutting off before the calls were done, so the old original battery was no longer cutting the mustard. Wanted to make sure the replacement was a real Panasonic battery, and found this as the best priced option. Amazon Prime worked as promised, and now I'm able to make those long conference calls at home. (was on a 90 min call and did not even drop one bar on the battery indicator!)"
5,Best Replacement Choice,"I don't buy those second rate or ""equivalent"" batteries because that's what you get ,second rate . I have a Panasonic phone I get a Panasonic replacement . Period ! You get what you pay for and I know these will perform like they were meant to ."
5,Replacement battery for Panasonic phone,"Actually this type of battery was required by manufacturer to be replaced with. The order was delivered on time, so thanks everyone who involved."
5,Just as advertised,"Not an imitation. Panasonic, just as advertised. Worked perfectly with my legacy phone. I bought 2 just to have a spare."
2,Should have bought the cheaper generic ones,"I was most Disappointed with these Panasonic replacement batteries for my cordless phones. I followed the charging instructions, and let them charge completely before using the phones. The charge lasts just as long as the original batteries that I was replacing. NOT LONG at all. So it seems, the new batteries don't hold their charge well. Even in stand-by when not in use. I love Panasonic products, but these batteries are the very first time that I've been let down by the brand. I should have ordered the generic replacement batteries for $4.00 and saved myself some cash."
5,panasonic cordless telephone battery review,Item was received before the date promised. Our phone is working well thanks to the new battery. what can I say it's a battery.
4,Timely service and excellent orginal packages.,I ordered three wireless phone batteries from this company and was worried that the batteries are not OEM version. I have receive all three batteries with its original packages and they are all running well so far in the past few weeks. I recommend its services.
4,Replacement for Panasonic cordless phones,OEM replacement battery fr Panasonic cordless phones. They last about 3 years in regular use (charge/deplete cycle). Same as other batteries in this class.
5,Great Ice Breaker tool,"I am a trainer in my organization and this is a great ""game"" to use for an ice breaker. It doesn't make adults feel like children since they have to use their minds."
2,'Canned' percussion and organ!,"Leo! What happened? Why the percussion drone from 'a can', are you trying to get a 'disco beat' to your music? And what happened to the tempo? Are you getting old? Cripple Creek accompanied by an organ? Come on! And this is the only up-beat song on the CD. Chet Atkins playing the lead guitar on your CD? I'll buy one of his CD's if I want to hear him play! 'Corina, Corina' is way too smooth, what happened to the guy who sang 'Pamela Brown'? Give me the younger Leo, straightforward great tempo and just 6 strings - 12 strings only when they are strung to one guitar. And a baritone voice of course, darker than the blackest coffee."
1,You get less than you pay for with this product!,"I bought two of these batteries a year or so ago, and found them unable to hold a charge. After 20 photos, the battery would die and I'd switch to the second. Same results. A year later and I can get about 2 photos out of a full charge.I'm now shopping for a REAL battery!"
4,satisfied,"I purchased 2 of these items for my old cannon camera, so far they have performed just as well as the higher priced cannon batteries."
3,interesting but falls short,"I really like Michelle Shocked and loved the previous albums, excluding ""The Campfire Tapes"" which I have yet to hear. This album thought tends to be much darker than her early work. On the previous albums there was a balance of happy and sad songs, but this one is definitely on the sad side through and through."
2,Why can't we all be more like her?,"This CD is a testament to how quickly an idealistic genius can turn into a preachy bore. Compare the music and the delivery of the message in this effort, to some of her earlier works. It's almost as if she loses her voice when she drops her vulnerability. Go back to talking about life and quit telling us all how we ought to be."
4,The Storm of Heaven,"A fantasy Roman Empire? What better story is there now. This is much better than Wheel of Time by Jordon because the "" Oath "" series is historical and has a reality feel to it."
2,I never quite understood the title.,"I thought Fulgazi was some underground group like Anthrax or Meat Beat Manifesto. Well, anyway, I would usually give hood flicks like this one star, but I give this two. It was vaguely funny. ""What's that smell!? Did you dookey!?"" ""I don't know!"" This movie is real derivative: I saw bits of ""Friday,"" ""Set It Off,"" and other movies in it. Still, it's only about 68 minutes long, so you don't have to suffer for 90 minutes as usual. The Spanish subtitles were 4 seconds off. If I character said, ""Hello, N-word!"", ""!Hola, amigo!"" would only appear on the screen 4 seconds later. At one point, a person says, ""ice"" as in jewels, but the translator must have heard it wrong 'cuz he or she wrote ""ojos,"" Spanish for ""eyes."" This DVD got its translating done at the dollar store! There's even a vague, positive, anti-violence message at the end. And of course, it had a tacked-on, not-even-necessary love story in it."
5,very good,I love this series very good. It keeps you wanting to know what happens next. When you think you know what is going to happen or who it is it catches you by something else happening.
5,Awesome tv show,The shipping was really fast. I really appreciated it. I was in vacation and I couldn't stop watching this tv show. I recommend this product to every person who liked the first season!
4,Showed up early,"Started watching the show on netflix got hooked, but season 2 wasn't on there, so i ordered 1 & 2 expecting it to be weeks before it showed up. Nope got it 4 days later was so excited and it was like brand new"
4,Catching Up,Bought season 1 for my grandson & watched with him. Now addicted & had to get season 2. Plus we enjoy watching together. The 3rd disc kept skipping & stalling in one part but we were able to get through it. Otherwise I would have given a perfect rating.
5,awesome!! :),awesome show i love all of the pretty little liars shows the first season and the second season love it!!!
3,Not Good,"There are many things wrong with this product:1. It got here 3 days later than expected2. Didn't receive my amazon receipt3. The box, on the inside was broken. I looked at the DvDs and they look fine. When i watch them I hope that they work."
1,I DIDNT GET IT!,I Still dont have it! I dont know what happened with it! I was supposed to get it last month i lost fifthty dollars
5,Obsessed,This tv show is so addictive! The story line keeps you interested and in suspense. This is my new favorite!
5,~Addictive Show!~,Pretty Little Liars is such an addictive show! It's suspenseful and full of drama and lots of scandal..It comes on regular cable which of course has commercials inbetween so I can't wait to puchase this which will be commercial free! If you haven't seen this show before it's defiantly worth seeing!
1,Gross. Tastes like a burlap sack.,"These seeds were at a reasonable price and had 2 good reviews, so I ordered 2 bottles. They do not have any sesame flavor, as they smell and taste strongly of a burlap sack. I buy so much on amazon and go by the reviews, but never leave them myself. These were so bad, I felt it necessary because I am so displeased and wanted to warn others. I love adding sesame seeds to so much and this order was a lot of seeds and money just wasted."
4,much better than studio recordings,"i'm a big fan of live music and i believe that a musician's live performance is a testament of how good of a musician he/she is. this cd proves that maroon 5 is fantastic. in fact, i like these acoustic performances better than the studio recordings because they have a more raw sound to them. the band sings/plays the songs they way they want to, adding personality and depth to the lyrics and melody. the vocals are strong and the bongos and guitars are wonderful. my only gripe is that they didn't include their best cover, ""Closer"" originally by Nine Inch Nails, on this cd. And while the cover of ""Highway to Hell"" by drummer Ryan Dusick isn't the greatest, its still fun. i highly recommend this album. i also highly recommend seeing them in concert. they are incredible live."

2,Cute idea- Not that great!,"I read the other reviews & thought this would be cute for my 6 year old. You fill it up with water, put in the balls & plug it in. It does make a lot of noise. The top does not screw on, you just place the lid on top with nothing to secure it on so spills are inevitable. We placed it high on a shelf because of our 1 year old trying to play with it. It's a cute lamp but there are definately flaws in the product. I think it's priced too high. In my opinion not worth it. I was originally looking for a lava lamp & should have stuck with that."
4,great night light,"My son received this lamp as a Christmas present. He loved the colors that the lamp emits (changes every few seconds) and the random motion of the balls is quite hypnotic - much like a lava lamp. It makes a great night light. The top does not fit very securly, so we have added some tape to make sure that it does not spill onto his furniture, but all in all, we like it very much."
2,TRY AGAIN,SHOES SEEM TO RUN VERY NARROW BUT THEY ARE NICE SO I WILL TRY TO STRETCH THEM HOPE IT WORKS
5,Battery,Works great with the new batteries. A little tricky to install in the shaver but well worth the time and trouble.
2,Sodering Required,"I have no issue with the battery; I would have liked to have known before hand that the installation was a bit tricky. Do not expect a quick fix; you don't just change out these batteries like any old AA or AAA. You have to remove the old ones and solder in the new ones. So if you don't own a soldering iron and don't feel inspired to learn a new skill, I would suggest buying a new shaver all together."
2,Died after 9 months,"I've done a lot of soldering, but this project was a nightmare. That, and it's short life would have qualified it for 1 star, but other reviews list ""tricks"" that may or may not have worked on my Norelco shaver (6863xl), so I gave it 2 stars, just in case. If you want a short term solution to your battery issue, and a challenging do-it-yourself project, this is your battery."
3,Norelco batteries,Product is ok and seems well made but I can not speak to it's performance as it requires a soldering iron to install and I do not have access to one at the moment.
4,Brought my Norelco razor back to life!!,"My 6 year old Norelco 7885xl razor battery life kept dropping until I had to plug it in to recharge every other day. I finally got tired of that and started shopping for replacement batteries. I Googled my razor to see how difficult it was to take apart and replace the battery. I found this online article very helpful: [...] I found this battery to be reasonably priced so decided to take the plunge. I ordered it from Amazon and received the product within a very short period of time. I used the above mentioned article to help me disassemble and replace the batteries. Warning: This project is not for the feint of heart! Unless you have good soldering skills I wouldn't recommend attempting to replace your own batteries. Fortunately I had the tools, soldering iron & solder sucker to get the job done. My razor now performs like it did when it was brand new. I am very pleased and would highly recommend this product."
5,Great discription of sensory issues,After I ordered and listened to the first copy of this I ended up ordering three more. One for my child's therapist and two for the schools my children attend. It really seems to have helped the schools understand my child's issues.
3,Loved the writing,"This story drew me in right away. I love Jennifer Greene's writing, and have read a few of her other books. What I liked about this book was that there was a lot going on, and the pacing kept me turning the pages. I was a little less enthusiastic, especially as the book went on, with the way the heroine was presented. She too easily gave up on her marriage and dove into an affair. Especially when the husband wanted to work things out."
5,Nice start,"Useful work on a much neglected subject of importance to those concerned about emergencies or ""bugging out."" Many with huge vehicles can't drive across a parking lot safely, while many ""lesser"" vehicles can be prepared and used successfully by someone who actually knows what the heck they're doing."
4,men will love it,"I bought it for my husband in China. I believe he will like it. It's much more beautiful than the picture here. In fact, a friend of mine saw the watch and decided to buy one for himself."
1,it is just Magnesium!,"hmmm... while the description sounds amazing, one can simply buy magnesium supplements without the hyperbole.It is amazing that they can get away with this.Wow"
3,It's Ok but willnot buy again.,"This is not something I take regularly, only when constipated. It does work without cramping and pain, but I do not care to repurchase this."
3,Sounds Uninspired....,...Maybe this was too soon? I loved Indigenous . The last EP...Long Way Home... I thought was incredible...that was the Indigenous I always hoped they would become. So I had reasonably high expectations for this record. Well Im afraid this album is a step backwards for Mato. The material is good ...but not great. The guitar work is solid ...but uninspired and repetitive. The songs arent particularly memorable. I can only hope the next album goes back to the sound they formed on Long Way Home.... that was evolution for the band... this CD is regression.
4,Great covers and great style,This is a great rocked-out blues album doing serious homage to Stevie Ray Vaughn. I'm very glad the artist is now branching out on his own. He's definitely got the talent to do this and I'm looking forward to seeing more of this happen as he earns his place in the music world.
5,Best of the best,"Kenny's the best. What a range. First he was pure pop (Silver Morning, Inside). Then he did some great work in jazz (Because of You, Professional Dreamer). This album is jazz, but with a nice Brazilian samba, showing a nice influence of Jobim. It's a relaxing but rhythmic piece of sound. Although I'm generally favorable to anything that Kenny produces, this is absolutely my favorite."
1,If you need to Study for the Registry....This is not recommended,This book was a waste of time. Too involoved with other things andnot really helpful in guiding you for studying for the Big Test.The anatomy section was good -- but the remainder was a big waste of time. I do not recommend this at all.
5,"The First, Last and Only Book You Will Ever Need","The first, last, and only book you will ever need about boards. It's full of anecdotes, basic information and a variety of check lists to help any chairperson or board member function expertly."
4,Not quite sura-sura,"So far I am finding this quite a challenge, and I am only on the first chapter, but I like it; it would probably be more useful with an audiotape or CD, however."
5,Brilliant Superb,"What makes this more than ""Very good"" is the attention to psychological precision that a lesser film would have left out. Mangled passport, not applauding, and dozens of other such that shows the director understands her characters inside and out to the point that they are indistinguishable from actual people she knows. And on top of that the film generates enough thought and ideas about love and age differences to last months."
3,INTERESTING BUT A BIT SLOW AT TIMES.,"I BOUGHT ABOUT 20 FORIEGN FILMS ONE DAY WITH THE INTENT OF DIVING IN AND EXPOSING MYSELF TO SOMETHING I HAD IGNORED ALL MY LIFE. SO FAR, I'VE EITHER MADE POOR CHOICES OR THESE FORIEGN FILMS ARENT FOR ME. THIS ONE, I DID LIKE BECAUSE ITS THE SORT OF THING THAT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU. NO PART OF THIS WAS IN ANY WAY FAR FETCHED OR UNBELIEVEABLE. I WILL SAY THAT IT IS A BIT SLOW THOUGH- SOME SCENES DRAG ON LONGER THAN THEY NEED TO WHICH MAKES IT A TAD BORING IN PLACES. IF YOU'RE LIKE ME AND ARE THINKING ABOUT TRYING FOREIGN FILMS- THIS MIGHT BE A LOW OCTANE GOOD FIRST CHOICE- BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME OUT THERE THAT ARE VERY HARD TO WATCH, VIOLENT,PORNOGRAPGHIC, AND SHOWING LIFES NEGATIVES.THIS ONE IS NOT."
3,Left me hanging,"This was definatly not one of my favorite BSC books. There was no ending to the book. I was just thinking so what? The storyline with Uncle JOe was good, but as far as the cat story line it was stupid. Mallory never soloved the mystery of the Ghost Cat."
1,BEWARE,The reason I picked 1 star is that it is as low as the ratings go. I would opt for 0 stars if there were that choice.321 Studios is OUT OF BUSINESS! You probability can NOT activate this software. There is NO support. I bought this product a year ago and I can't use it! The software has to be activated over the internet and it DOES NOT work!
5,Amazing read for NASCAR lovers!,"I am a HUGE NASCAR fan. I saw this book at a bookstore and couldn't wait to read it. This book is full of inspirational people and stories. I can't say enough how much I love this book! Love, Love Love it!!!"
4,"A good book, but something was missing","If you want to read heart-warming stories about the greatest sport ever, then get this book. There are stories in there by drivers like Ned Jarrett and Richard Petty that are really cool. For some reason however, I was expecting more from this book. Don't get me wrong, this is a great book and you should certainly get it, but for some reason I was expecting something extra. A good overall book however. Get it."
5,Profundity beyond imagination,"A wonderful, touching book, at least once I got past the tricky words snuck into this book by some snooty, Merlot-sipping elitist in a New York City publishing house (e.g., ""concentrating,"" ""motivation,"" and ""rooster""). Also, I couldn't help but notice one highly glaring typo: For some reason, ""Git-r-dun"" is consistently misspelled as ""Get it done."" Guess they don't teach spelling in those fancy Ivy League schools, huh?"
3,Quality,"The over all quality of the product was better than I had hoped for . As of yet, I have found nothing out of the ordnary. The pages do not seem to have been inappropiatly used. I would use this source again."
5,the best,please give me the send me the summary of the book and the character cause i need it for my book report.pls??? that is the nicest novel id ever read
3,chocolate car charger,it is okay after charging your phone several times it tends to get loose and start coming out of the socket
5,Splendid Brazil a must have for Andy Summer Fans!!!!,The acoustic guitar on this CD is excellent!! I highly recommend it to any avid Andy Summer fans or acoustic fans! Beautiful latin flair!
1,wow,"ooooo wow, never bfore have I seen a mane like that. O.k. manes that are roached that low, normally tend to go down, they don't stick straight up in the air unless you gel it. scary."
5,An essential for anyone who works with volunteers,"This book puts forth ideas and resources that are changing the ways people view, value and involve volunteers. It represents the growing profound shift in how organizations should think about volunteer contributions and support for those volunteers. If you are part of an organization that involves volunteers, whether or not you yourself work with them directly, this book is ESSENTIAL for your bookshelf. Written by one of the most respected authorities on volunteersim and volunteer management in the world, Susan Ellis outlines the key executive decisions necessary to lay the foundation for effective volunteer involvement: policies, budgeting, staffing, employee-volunteer relationships, legal issues, and the value of volunteers beyond financial. Prepare to be challenged, and prepare to have traditional ideas about what volunteers represent swept away. This is an empowering and practical read, and a book you will reach for again and again."
4,poor quality,"We bought this clock for our daughter who was starting kindergarten. We have used the clock for less than 3 weeks. The alarm hand no longer works, which was our primary purpose for the clock. The alarm was never accurate from the beginning. Needless to say, we are searching for a new clock for her."
4,Tom the Dancing Bug,The political and social insights from years past are remarkable. One laughs while realizing that much of the humor is dead on serious business. I recommend this collection.
1,An Expert's Opinon,"In the Book Review section of the September 2003 edition of ""Wagner"": the journal of the Wagner Society; Stewart Spencer dedicates three pages (44-46) to demonstrating that this book is merely an addition to: ""...the mountain of worthless writings on Wagner.""The serious student should be wary therefore, of spending so much on a book considered ""worthless"" by Spencer: an established authority on the composer."
1,QuickBooks - 2004 release is just a waste of money,It's amazing that a company can sit for 3 years and add SO little innovation.Having used quickbooks for over 5 years i am really dissapointed with the the 2004 release. It's basically a re-wrap of a product from over 4 years ago. Definately NOT worth the value. Consider other options unless you are absolutely stuck.Nothing to look forward to in this version.
1,The last time I experiences bad software like this was in 93,"The last time I experiences bad software like this was in 1993. Second, the nag ware is equal in annoyance as getting locked into a web site that keeps spawning new pages when you attempt to close one. It makes this program a painful and frustrating experience.(...)My opinion, why even bother to expose yourself to this potential mess. If you have read this ""opinion"" and still decide to buy this software, only blame yourself when you want to fling your PC across the room.Look at all the prior write ups and ask yourself ""why am I going to be any different?"""
1,The purpose of a calendar is to SEE THE DATE!!!!,"I have had a ""Stardate"" calendar on my desk ever since they started issuing them in 1997 and have enjoyed every year...except for this 2003 edition. I myself am a graphic designer and can not understand what... Paramount/Pocket Books has doing their designs but the dates on this version of the calendar are entirely too small! The purpose of a box calendar is for one to quickly be able to read the current date at a glance. This year's calendar has the numbers so small in the lower left corner that by the time you find it, you might as well have just searched for it on a wall calendar.Also, enough of this centering the entire Star Trek universe around this pethetic excuse for a show called ""Enterprise"". I buy the Stardate calendars for the Star Trek aspect, not the new ""Enterprise"" show logo on every page!Take it from a graphic designer and a 20 year Star Trek fan...don't waste your money on this year's Stardate Calendar."
3,More about his journey than the railroad experience,"While the book was a good read, it spent to much time dealing with his friends that he stayed with. He spent way to little time on how train travel works, what his experiences were aboard AMTRAK, and the beauty of traveling by rail. His stay in New Orleans, with a friend, was interesting, but not why I bought the book."
3,Armchair traveler,"If you like trains and train travel, you'll enjoy this book. Not all chapters are equally interesting and the book is ""dated"" at this point, but for train enthusiasts, it's a nice way to spend a few hours."
5,Great book,"My wife is known in the family as ""The Garden Angel"" due to herlove of plants and skills in the garden. She read the book in one day.Thank You"
5,A glorious romp through a Southern town,"I read through this book in 24 hours -- something quite unusual for me, but I couldn't wait to see what would happen in the end. The story explores how and when one reveals intimacies in fragile relationships -- what current thoughts to speak, when to discuss one's past, and how other people can affect the formation and endurance of relationships. The writing style was intricate in details, yet easy to read. The author has keen observations about people, their surroundings and their interactions. I highly recommend the book as it is both entertaining and thought-provoking."
5,Very Nice - I Like It.,"I just recently purchased this laptop model and I am very satisfied with its performance. I like the fact that the lcd screen is very sturdy. A good way to test this is to press your fingers behind a ""test"" model in a retail store and look for the distortion on the screen in the form of ""press waves"" on the plasma. All of the Toshiba laptops I did this to had no distortion whatsoever. Other comperable brands such as HP and Compaq (stay away from these), did in fact distort. To me that means the screen is quite flimsy. For a grad student like myself, this had everything I could want in a laptop for a price just over a grand. I strongly recommend you opt for the 2-3 year extended life warranty if such a place offers it to you. This covers any accidental dammage or hardware problems. It's usually about 250 dollars extra but it is so worth it..."
5,BEST CAMERA VALUE,THIS ITEM WAS DESCRIBED PERFECTLY (though I would like to have enlarged the photograph of it) AND THE VALUE WAS AT LEAST 50% OFF.
5,Worked like a charm!,This particular charger worked great with my battery for my Kodak Easy Share DX7440 camera.
2,I Found the Correct Charger!,"Hey if you are looking for the CORRECT charger for the Kodak V550 I have found it. It is after market but hey it works. Go to www.titannotebook.com and type in BCYKDIC7001 and you will see the charger that works for the Kodak V550, if you need the Kodak V530 charger then type in BCYKDIC7002 and it will bring up the charger. I recently used the V550 model charger on vacation and it worked!! Hope that this helps."
5,Very convenient charger kit,It is a must if you traffic overseas a lot. It fits almost everywhere in the world. The only thing it needs to know is it does not work for all recharge batteries.
3,It does what it says,"The product is just what it says it is. Nothing more, nothing less. If you have purchased a camera from Kodak and it included in the package a rapid charger. Chances are this is a duplicate. I was after the addapter plugs and this seems to be the only way one can get them. Too bad Kodak does not offer just the plugs since they only include std. US plug in the package with the camera."
1,Caveat Emptor...,"Another case of a purchase to accompany the Kodak V-550 camera, as recommended by Amazon. This charger is not compatible with the KLIC-7001 Li-ion battery used in the referenced camera. The product needed is the K 7500C charger. I was not able to find the K 7500C on Amazon, but did manage to obtain from the Kodak website. I gave a 1-star rating because Amazon's return system only provides one option for returning the ""wrong product"", and fault for the error defaults to the consumer, who ultimately absorbs the return shipping charges. An accurate product description at the point of sale, including a list of compatible batteries would have been nice."
2,MISCATEGORIZED: Not for Kodak v530 or v550!,"I'm sure this is a fine product, but it is advertised as something it is not. This charger is listed as an accessory for the Kodak v550 and it is NOT compatable. On the charger box it clearly states that it fits Kodak batteries 5000 & 5001, but this is not clear on the Amazon website. The v550 has a 7000 series battery and this charger will not work."
1,Heads up Amazon,Bought this Kodak K 5000-C Li-Ion Rapid Battery Charger Kit along with a Kodak V-550 camera per Amazon's recommendation for my son's up-coming trip to London. Problem is....we needed the KODAK K7500-C Li-Ion Universal Battery Charger Kit for the batery in the V-550. Now I have two days to scramble around and find one locally before he departs.
1,Buyer Beware! Not for V550.....,"Imagine my disappontment when this Christmas gift was all wrong. Why? Simply stated the site is misleading and has obviously mislead others. If you own a V550 or V530 this is not the correct charger! You may have to pay to ship it back and go though the hassle as well. I have contacted Amazon about it, and they readily agreed to refund the shipping. As far as I can tell, you can only(at least for right now), purchase it from Kodak Direct. Good luck and be careful to check all the numbers carefully!"
1,Finally found the RIGHT charger,"I Found the Correct Charger!, Feb 2nd, 2006Reviewer Allen----- You would not believe the problem I was having finding a charger. Kodak even gave me the run around!!!! I am very happy with my 550 but Unhappy with Kodak,s service they list a charger but don't sell it. I came to Amazon to find a charger and found out that the one on their site is not the correct one so I ordered one from the site below. Thank You Thank You Thank You for this honest review.""""""Hey if you are looking for the CORRECT charger for the Kodak V550 I have found it. It is after market but hey it works. Go to www.titannotebook.com and type in BCYKDIC7001 and you will see the charger that works for the Kodak V550, if you need the Kodak V530 charger then type in BCYKDIC7002 and it will bring up the charger.

2,broke first day,The door over one of the compartments broke on the first day. It is not worth the time and effort to return it. Just cheap .. Iguess you get what you pay for .....
5,perfect reminder and organizer,"This case is really helpful for people who take several pills each day. Once it's organized it saves having to open several pill containers each day. It does take a bit of time at the beginning of each month, but more time is saved than expended."
1,Immediately broke,I started popping open the slots to place my pills inside and compartment '31' immediately broke. Really disappointing when a product breaks within 30 seconds of use. Not going to waste my time on returning this item so I suppose it's my fault for the loss of cash.
1,Terrible !!!!,Several of the flaps to hold the medicine in broke off the first time I used it. A couple of the other flaps would not close. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
5,"I loved it, but I need some help!","Like all of the above, I loved the book. Naturally. Richard Powers probably invests more time, intellectual care and loving attention on his grocery lists than most authors do on their novels. But can anyone tell me what the code on the first page decodes as? I know I'm supposed to get it. I tried. I reread the book, O.K., Powers? Twice. Maybe I'm no good with codes. I listened to the damned Goldberg, yes, Glenn Gould version. I wrote out pages of decoding nonsense, and what have I got? A feeling of inferiority the size of a city of 10 million neighborhoods of one."
5,"Compelling, captivating, challenging","One of the most amazing feats I have read in many years of combining intellectual challenge with powerful emotions. The multi-level parallelisms keep opening, more and more, as all the themes of the saga converge. When you get this book, get a CD of the Goldberg Variations, preferably the Glenn Gould performance."
5,Not for the Lightweight Reader,"After reading Powers's Galatea 2.2, I started reading his novels in their order of publication. I was as prepared as anyone can be for the complexity of Gold Bug Variations, enjoyed it thoroughly through both laughter and tears, and had a very difficult time settling into the next book, Plowing The Dark. By the time I finished The Time of Our Singing, I was longing for more from this brilliant, addictive author. The Echo Maker is shelved until I can afford the time I know I'll want to devote to it. My children went unfed while I read Gold Bug Variations; it's just that engrossing. I miss Ressler, too."
2,But it wasn't enjoyable.,"Despite my fascination with the composition that inspired this book, and admiration for the author's fine use of prose, my sense is that this novel remains a tour de force of structure minus substance. I did not find it particularly engaging."
5,It arrived,Ordered it. It arrived quickly. It is used and is as described . I'll update whenever I read it. f
3,Motif + prose != novel,"He writes good prose. He has nothing, really, to write. ""Science lost its calm?"" What the heck? He was looking for anything BUT calm, right? He was frantic to accomplish greatness before research-death at 30. That's not the real reason he abandoned molecular biology. Powers wants his characters to make these brilliant, enigmatic revelations. Trouble is, Powers knows nothing brilliant about life. The Dutch chick in Galatea had no deep insight. She just uttered meaningless epigrams, and the reader is supposed to contemplate and receive revelation."
3,Modernism disguised as Pynchon,"Powers' book is thick. Probably too thick. It seems to strive for the impossible and takes this quest too seriously. Unlike Pynchon, this is not a satire of old modernist tower climbing.True, Power's has created a stunning tower, but maybe it is just a tower of babble. or then again is this book a satire of Pynch?"
2,But it wasn't enjoyable.,"Despite my fasciation with the composition that inspired this book, and admiration for the author's fine use of prose, my sense is that this novel remains a tour de force of structure minus substance. I didn't find it particularly engaging."
1,Boring,"I finally gave up about half way through the book. It is simply not worth the effort. Powers is undoubtedly a brilliant man, but he doesn't need to demonstrate it in every sentence. I read for enjoyment and relaxation, this book provides neither."
5,excellent value and performances,"Like the other entries in DG's ""Collector's Editions"", the eight discs come in envelopes and a compact box with a liner note booklet. This box includes all of the Beethoven violin sonatas (3 full discs) Kremer recorded in the late eighties and early nineties. The performances are higly regarded (see Amazon reviews under the individual discs, Penguin and Grammaphon reviews very positive as well). In addition, you get higly regarded recrodings of sonatas by Schumann and Brahms. The Prokofiev is the only disc of the eight that falls flat. The music does not require Kremer's pyrotechnics and would benefit from a subtler interpretation. Recording quality is first rate throughout. All in all, an excellent repackaging and value!"
1,Worst ever,"The product might be ggreat but I don't know it because it didn't arrive. I wrote to them but they never answered. I am still waiting for my answer and for my money.The seller was disscountpetsupplies, don't trust them, they don't answer if there is a problem."
4,Great courses --- great price!,"This course is as good as the course my former company had purchased for $2000!The Navigator was great -- I just worked through the material and it tracked what I'd done, how well I'd done it, and how much more (ugh!) I had to do.I wish there were more scenario-based questions, and the reading materials could have used a better edit, but overall I felt I really got my money's worth.I'm using this product with the Coriolis Exam Cram books to prepare for my tests. So far I'm three for three!"
2,"Great tests, but very little study information","If all you are looking for is test questions, then this is the set for you. You can test yourself silly. If you are looking for study material this is the wrong book for you. If you want to use this with other study material it is a good combination book."
2,"Many, many typos in the book & online documentation.","There are so many typos, I fear that the knowledge being presented may also be inaccurate. I've only just started going through the program and I've already found one ""fact"" not quite accurate because of a typographical error. I'm sure Mr. Sirockman is an ""expert"" but if he can't take the effort to even proofread his product, how can I trust that he took the time to get the facts right?"
3,EXCELLENT COMPLEMENT TO OTHER BOOKS!,"Although I would not rate this program with five stars by itself, it is an excellent computer training program to complement other texts for the MCSE.NOTE: Make sure you decide of the two optional programs (MCSE elective exams) before you load the software. It is almost impossible to change them later and this is omitted in the instructions."
2,"Many errors in tests, esp. in Network Essentials",I bought this package with great anticipation but I was truly disappointed with the quality of the software as there were just too many errors.I have just started with Network Essentials. I hope the other topics are not as bad.
3,Not as described,"The quality looks good and the leather feels very nice. I like everything about this produce EXCEPT the size is not what was described. Description said 9 in X 5 in.Actually it measures slightly under 8.5 in. in length, 4.25 in. width when closed (opens to 8.25). Because of shorter length, boarding passes or tickets stick out the top 1 to 2 inches and folded 8.5 X 11 documents do not fit in the length of the pockets (stitching takes up room). I really wish sellers would be more careful with details. If it was an inch or so longer I would have rated it 5 stars."
3,it did not smell or feel like leather,"The passport case was excellent in terms of organization and size, however, I was looking for a leather case and this clearly was not leather. Nowhere on the item was there any tags indicating it was leather and it did not smell or feel like leather. I will ask for a rebate."
5,High Quality Leather Durable and Stylish,Needed something durable to take on the road when travelling. Has survived 5 business trips now over Europe NA and Asia and am very pleased with results. Holds all tickets and passports very safely and I never worry aobut them falling out. Personalization of name on passport is impeccable. love this wallet
3,Decent Product,"This product is very useful, but if I could do it again. I would definitely pay a few more dollars for a holder that zips up or closes just to protect any items that may slip out, but if your are only carrying a few items then this is a solid product!"
1,Would not buy again,First one I received printed wide black lines across the page. Second one I received started printing lightly just after the 30 day return was over. Buy original cartridges and save the headaches.
5,Intense as a slab of ribs cooked by the corner barbecue man,"These are John Lee Hooker's first recordings. These are not the covers he made later, but are the real thing. Most early blues recordings are so raw that only dyed-in-the-wool blues fans would like them, but such is not the case here. On these recordings John stomps his foot for percussion, strums and finger-picks his guitar for rhythm and lead, and in the saucy tone he gets from his guitar you can hear the coming roar of Rock and Roll. The songs, in the same order as he historically recorded them, progress from acoustic to electric guitar as a sort of Stairway to Blues Heaven.If you are a musician, study this album to see how one man stomping his foot can generate enough intensity for an entire band.If you are a music lover, well, man just groove!"
5,Good Stuff,"I have been using Skin Eternal Serum for a few years now. I went through chemo some years ago, which made my skin dry and wrinkled, with some dark patches. I can't afford a face lift or extensive visits to the dermatologist, but was very impressed with the beneficial effects of using this every night. My only complaint is that it stains the pillowcase."
4,Glowing!!!,This gives you glowing skin!!!!! I gave this a 4 star instead of 5 because it has a weird smell and you have to apply it and wait like 5 min to put on any other moisturizer and make up. It need times to soak in! Other than that it really makes my skin tighter and gives you a glow! Great product for such a little price!
2,Don't get it,"Tried this serum on my face and neck, didn't saw any wow effect. On 3rd day I saw the first signs of allergy. Temporary stop using this."
3,positive,... have been using Skin Eternal for over a month... so far so good... skin less wrinkled...
3,Disappointment,"I bought this product because of it's full features and good reviews. It is well built and came with Roxio software. It performed all functions well, but one. It wouldn't read various DVDs. It didn't matter whether they were commercial movies or made by me in any format. I dealt with TDK free support on numerous occasions. They were very patient, but ultimately felt it was obviously some problem with my end, not theirs. Out of frustration I bought an I/O Magic drive with substantially the same specs as the TDK, but MUCH less expensive and probably not quite as well built. However, ALL features in this unit worked perfectly right out of the box. It uses the same basic software as the TDK. I feel very disappointed and don't feel I got much satisfaction from TDK, to say nothing of the money wasted."
5,great selections; great performance,"The more I listen to this title, the more the songs grow on me. My favorite is still ""The Rock"" but some I wasn't too crazy about at first, now seem necessary selections. I really admire Ms. James's style and want to acquire more of her recordings."
5,better than ever,i can only say that miss james just keeps gettin better and better. her renditions of these country songs really outdo the original artist. I've been loving you to long is a wonderful recording. con't go a week without playing this album a must
4,What can I say... its a battery,"It is a battery. Holds a charge, lets me take pictures.I will say, however, that this is one picky battery- it only works on the products it was manufactured for.No variety, no pizzaz. I mean, lets say I decide to jazz up its sad little life- does it want to try powering a video game, or a cell phone? No. Does it want to work together with other, different batteries and power something far bigger than it could power on its own? Again, no.Don't get me wrong, it works fine for what it is SUPPOSED to do; it just has no imagination. No career flexibility. No dreams or hopes of surpassing its present state.For that reason, I give this fully functional, but intrinsically boring battery 4 stars.(it would have gotten three, but it seems to be willing to work with any PERSON who comes along and turns it on... I suspect a moral weakness or deviance there. We'll see)"
5,Great battery,"I needed an extra battery for my Kodak P880. This was the battery that was recommended by Kodak. It works like a charm. I like having 2 batterys, I never worry about my camera dying. If you're looking for a replacement battery or an extra battery for your Kodak camera, this is a great one."
5,"Good Product, Good service","The battery came quickly and, now that I have a backup , has been a life saver on more than one occasion. Less expensive than acquiring it from Kodak, too.I could not find the product in Dallas at any of the local camera stores or in the big box retail stores."
1,Poor Vendor Service,"I ordered the wrong battery. I immediately notified the vendor but he would not respond, sent the wrong battery anyway, and refused to take it back."
1,Item may have been stolen...we never received,"My husband and I realized we'd never received this package and, upon checking the Amazon tracking, and also the UPS tracking number, which indicated ""delivered"" and ""front door"" - at 7:49pm, means that it was just left on the porch, we don't recall hearing a doorbell ring and it appears this item, if in fact it was left, was stolen from us. We don't know what recourse we have, but would appreciate some communication from Amazon...doesn't UPS require a signature for deliveries??"
4,Kodak camera battery,I cannot evaluate this product now. It is an item that i bought to use in reserve and it has not been used yet.
4,Good OEM battery for Kodak digicams,A good battery from Kodak! One charge sees you through a reasonably long time. That it is Li-ion helps since these type of batterys need not be discharged completely before being charged again.Go for it...
4,The Stomp Box Cookbook,"An excellent book which has given me lots of ideas. Unfortunately the project I chose to work on (the Squeeze-o-matic II guitar compressor) has an error in the PCB layout which is unfortunate, so I give only four stars."
3,Vol. 6 Wildcat & Mr. Terrific (Weak art alert!),"This particular collection is of interest to fans of the JSA because it contains the stories that give Wildcat and Mr. Terrific their memberships. Instead of being forgotten heroes of the forties, their legacies live on because of these brief appearances. Roy Thomas's intro explains the events leading up to this change in membership clearly. The main problem with this edition is the art. It is of particularly poor quality by lesser lights, with the exception of Joe Kubert's wonderful Hawkman segments, and make the stories appear exceptionally amateurish. It's a shame because the stories themselves are pretty good, especially the one dealing with the heroes being aided by people with disabilities which seems fairly enlightened for the time period. Not some of All-Star Comics finest moments, but has historical value for the comic fan."
1,terrible!,"This machine is AWFUL! There are two wireless mics which is a great concept but they don't work. One mic has less power than the other so you can't hear two kids at once. Depending on where you locate the machine, neither mic will work without horrible interference or feedback. Stick with a machine that has wires! My daughter tried to use this for about a week and now, the toy is headed for the garbage."
1,Should be better quality for the price,The noise coming through the speakers when the mics are on is horrible. There was no way to get rid of it. Sorry we ever bought it. Now our daughter thinks Santa brought her this broken piece of equipment.
1,Complete Garbage!,"Do not even waster your money. I can not beleive that this is still $100.00! We bought it last year for my 4 year old daughter for Christmas. We returned it the following week. It was complete garbage! If you really want a Singing Machine, spend the extra money and get the real thing!"
1,WHAT A HORRIBLE GIFT!!,"Giving this as a gift is like giving a kid a drumset, only this is worse because your child has to have an audience for it to be any fun, so the rest of the family is captive to a loud, not necessarily very musical performances. You can't hide this one out in the garage.Additionally, if your child, like mine, is not particularly outgoing, musically inclined or self-confident, this is a self-esteem trasher. Within the first fifteen minutes my daughter was in tears because it sounded so bad.This machine came with one cdg, with 4 songs on it that no one in our house was familiar with. In order for this to be a fun toy we would have had to spend additional money for cdgs of songs she is familiar with.[...]"
1,pretty awful...,The cover is somehow deceiving... this book has recipes that call for a can of cream of celery soup or cheez whiz... ick.
4,Great investment,I just received this watch winder and it is everything that the description says. It makes little to no noise and my rolex watches fit perfectly in it. My only complaint is that I don't know how durable it is. I can only hope it lasts as long as the watches it protects.
1,Save your money and visit the IBM site.,Most buzz words for e-commerce are contained in this superficial book but no meat.Not useful for learning Websphere so you should go to the IBM site or wait for a decent book to be published.The book's illustrations are inconsistent with the version on the included CD.
3,can be better,"Good stuff: Covers wide range of technologies and allow you to quick grab a lot of new stuff. If you novice in web development you can read about ejb,servlet and etc in one book and it saves your time.Bad stuff: Examples have a lot of mistakes, and when you try to run your first ejb and you need to fix a lot of typos in code it wastes your time. Authors use WAS2 and your probably will use WAS3, so all explanation about deployment is useless.If by the time you will read this review you can buy another book - buy another, but now it's only one about websphere so you just have no choice."
3,Overpriced & buggy,"Locks up/freezes in the middle of a song. NOT good when the dance floor is packed, your boss is watching, & you have to reboot it. Of course you can do the same thing on a low end computer or laptop (software is extra) that won't lock up a lot cheaper."
2,Buy the Red Hymnal. Its 100 times better.,"This bad revision is a put together from odds and ends of synods that do not fit together. Get the real thing, the red hymnal of 1985. The liturgy in the red hymnal (as opposed to this shoddy book is beautiful. Our congregation switched from green (the new one) to red (the old hymnal) a few years ago and I was surprised at the difference! The bolderizations are gone, the liturgy is lighter and the excellent old music is brought to life. While the green hymnal is much much better than the dull and lifeless With One Voice (WOV) - or With One Vice as I like to call it - it simply can't compare to the red hymnal in excellent music. I would give the green hymal one star, but that shd be reserved for WOV."
5,Great Hymnal,"The church that I belong to has been using this book since the early 1980's. It was our only hymnal until we got a hymnal supplement in 1991 and then the With One Voice hymnal in the late 1990's. If you enjoy traditional service settings, organ music, and old hymns that most know, then this hymnal is a great choice for you!"
5,"""Indie Idol - Jon Peter Lewis""","This album has some of the best songs I've heard lately. Man From Amsterdam is one of them. It's definitely not one of those albums where every song sounds the same. As summed up by veteran DJ, JD Matthews, ""It's one of those rare CDs that I can actually listen to over and over again, continue to enjoy, and still get something new out of it with each rotation. This is one CD purchase you should make. Give it a chance, and you'll understand why Jon is, indeed, the ""Indie Idol.""On another note, Sky Elobar is Jon's bass player and a phenomenal musician. As a permanent member of Jon's band, he is a testament to Jon's talents. Sky only works with the best and most promising artists and musicians. Kudos to Jon, Sky, and all who were involved in making this superb album!!"
3,It's Interesting,"I bought this for my wife who really loves JPL, but only knew of his performances on American Idol. Like most AI contestants' albums, the album is not representative of his performances there. Rather, it's his own style. I can't say that I love the album, but it's not terrible either. It's a good mix of styles, so you won't get bored with the same-sounding song over and over again."
3,From English Housewife to World Class French Winemaker,"I enjoyed the book because I love wine, grapes, the vines, and I admired the woman that Patricia became before the end of the book. It starts slow and the mix of French and English without translating the French into English is confusing, but worth wading through. I've read several memoirs of people who built, established, and managed vineyards and she does the best job of describing the work involved of any other so far. Her description of racing a tractor armed with spinning blades down the row of vines at rocket speeds that she later realized were that of a slow walk is worth the cover price by itself. I got a better idea of what the life of a vintner is like and recommend it to anyone considering this vocation."
1,A MUST NOT READ,"As a fellow Anglophone who has lived in France, I looked forward to reading about the British woman who succeeded in coming to France and making a life for herself. I could not have been more disappointed. This book was an excruciatingly detailed account of how to create and manage a vineyard; nothing else. The book had sparse to non-existent character development, leaving the reader with no bond to the characters in the book. While I understand that Ms. Atkinson might not want to tell readers personal details about her friends and family, it is somewhat necessary to get the reader to become invested with those same friends and family such that we would care what happened to them. All in all, the book is really recommended only for those who are truly interested in the daily details of wine cultivation and wine making."
5,Beautiful non-fiction tale of perseverance and friendship amongst the vines!,"Faced with a formidable challenge of single-handedly turning an overgrown vineyard into a economically viable operation, the heroine of this real-life story has the tenacity to beat the odds and go well beyond what most of us would consider an acceptable workload. Of course, the village setting and the many neighbors whose friendship shines through are the real stars of this wonderful book."
5,Great book!!,"This is the first book by Patricia Atkinson about her life in Southwest France.Along with the second book, La Belle Saison, these are the 2 best books aboutreal life in France with French friends, neighbors, shopkeepers, farmers, hunters and everybody in life. Starting a vineyard in France is not easy!"
4,East read,The Ripening Sun is an easy enjoyable read. For anyone interested in wine there is enough general detail to keep the interest in the narrative alive and prove that this is not a work of fiction.
1,way over priced,"What is with these people? Almost no one is going to pay 300 , 400 , 500 dollars for this or any show. What do you make the DVDs out of ? Gold? I love the Rifleman and want the show, but for a decent price. i might even pay as much as $100 for the entire set. Maybe if you lowered the price (by alot) you might sell a few."
1,"Sorry, but I can't justify even buying this product.","Sorry, but I can't justify even buying this product. First the price is way high per episode of a show that is over 50 years old. Second the sets are not broken down by season. Although I loved this show when I was little (and by the way, it was an OLD show when I was little... being shown as old re-runs), I guess that I will have to settle for rawhide or maverick to introduce my old shows to my sons. I would probably pay $40 for the whole first season... although I'm not sure how many episodes that was (maybe 20 to 25?), but 250 for 20 episodes that are not even all the first season is crazy pricing. Maybe eventually it will be repackaged so that I can justify buying. But there are a lot of other really good westerns from that era of TV that are way better packaged and way more reasonably priced."
4,The those who love the classic cocktails,"What I love about this book is that it focuses on the classic cocktails, the drinks that have lasted over time and fads and eras. It addresses the cocktail as not something you slug back while clubbing, but to be enjoyed with good company and conversation. The photos are exquisite, the recipes solid and the quotes and stories just add to it. A gift for yourself or a friend."
4,Enjoyable and well worth your time,"At last Helen McCloy's novels and short stories are back in print! She is a wonderful writer who doesn't cheat; she gives the reader all the clues needed to solve the mystery. Her clever detective, Dr. Basil Willing, usually puts the clues together in ways that wouldn't occur to most of us. McCloy often includes a delicious little frisson of the the supernatural in her stories, something to make you wonder ""what if?"" Her characters are well drawn, in few strokes, and the resolutions have that certain inevitability of the best detective stories. Well worth your reading time."
1,Do Not Get This CD Player!!,"This Product sounds really great and at the beginning played fairly well. I was really impressed with its quality.But for no reason it has now stopped working. Don't buy this product, It will break down on you.I had this for only two weeks and now it has stopped working. It is a waste of time and a waste of money!! Trust me, do not get this CD Player."
3,so so,"Personally, I think its an 'ok' walkman but the case is cheap plastic for the price with 3 metallic blue stickers on the front. The red one we got looked like a little kid's walkman so I wasn't to hot on using it in 'public' but the sound was good. I did not like the head phones they were uncomfortable and wrapped around my head and a pain to get off without tangling my hair up."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"This cd player is not very good at all, it will not play any CD-R's with out excessive skipping. It might play the first few songs ok, but then it will jump, and skip threw the rest of the cd. The sound quality is pretty good when you are listening to a regular cd, but if you want to play a burned cd, forget it. If you are looking for a good cd player, go for the Panasonic SL-SX320, which is $10 dollars cheaper, that is a much better cd player. I returned this cd player and got the Panasonic SL-MP70 which is also a much better player than this one, and it also plays MP3 cd's. Good luck in making your decision!"
2,Dont waist your money,It sucks it doesnt read some of my Burned CD'S and skips when its supposed to have G-Protection And a Walkman.
1,PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS CD PLAYER!,"I recently recieved this walkman as a gift for Christmas. The thing looked cool, and I was eager to try it out. I popped a CD in. The first two songs were great- the sound quality was terrific. But it skipped vilontely during the third track, and continued to do so in nearly every song. The same thing happened with a few other CDs. I am on my way to exchange it. I know it is cool looking and that the sound quality is excellent, put do not purchase this item."
1,Looks cool but sucks,"i've had it for around three months(never dropped it) and a few days ago all of a sudden it stopped working and it had nothing wrong,and then after a week when i was about to throw it away it started working again.dont even bother buying this junk."
4,A sleek little machine.,"I love my neat little red cd player. I've had it for over a year, and it has served me well in that time. It has superb sound quality, insanely long battery life, and it's very sleek. However, I now have to seek a replacement, as a two 1/2 foot trip to the floor seems to have destroyed it; it will play discs, but it will pause and skip every second or so, and it makes hideous noises when it starts to spin the discs. My only complaints about it are:I hate those wrap around headphonesIt wouldn't play most of my burned cds (I only have a few, and most of them refuse to work in this, while my old crappy cd player worked fine with them)Such a fall should not have ruined it. Durability is a must for portable items such as this."
4,One of the best Cd players I've ever bought!,I just bought this cd player yesterday and I really like it and it was worth my money. My stone age cd player broke and buying this new cd player was worth it and it was a good price considering it was a fairly new model. It is very neat and has lots of modes and plays really good. I rate this product a 4 because the only problems I see with it are that when you pause the music a beebing noise comes out of the headphones and you can't turn it off and also the cd player doesn't have a mode where you can repeat sonds over again you have to do it manually.I strongly consider if you need a new cd player thats a good price for a good brand I suggest this cd player is the one for you!!!
1,DON'T BUY,"Okay, I got this CD player for Christmas (2003) and it seemed okay at first,but the the buttons were really confusing. Then about two months later it would no longer olay my CD's. So I still had the waranty and i retutrned it for a new one. So, about three months and it did the same thing. it has an ugly tab thing and scratches easily. Plus it gets fingerprits all over it."
2,Not worth it.,Recieved this as a gift in late '03. I dropped the player once from a short distance while working out and it never played again. The sound quality was iffy at best while it worked and it was quite heavy. I have an earlier Sony model that has lasted two years while being dropped numerous times. Don't bother; keep looking.
2,Awesome.... at first,"When I first got this CD Player I thought it was great. Great sound, didn't skip etc. But after about a month, it just randomly stopped working. It still plays CDs, but none of the buttons work on the CD player, and it isn't on Hold. I've tried everything. Though judging the rest of the reviews, I might have just gotten a bad model."
1,Don't Get It,"I've purchased this Walkman twice in the past. With the first version I had, it was exposed to a tiny amount of water, and did not ever turn on again. With the second version, I purchased it and one week after I purchased it, it began to malfunction. The player turns off randomly, even if it is not exposed to any shock. Granted, this player may look ""cool"", but it is not durable and is a waste of money. Buy another version, like a Panasonic, which are extremely durable. Stay away from this version!"
1,"Look is cool, performance is cruel!","Very disappointing purchase, would not expect this from a great brand like Sony. After 4 songs, the CD-R starts skipping. I returned the CD player after 4 days of use."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SUCKS,"I BOUGHT THIS CD PLAYER,,THEN I LISTENED TO IT FOR LESS THEN AN HOUR, THE NEXT DAY I TURNED IT ON, AND IT DIDN'T WORK!!! OH AND ANOTHER THING, THEY CALL THOSE HEADPHONES ""STYLISH"" THEY ARE JUNK!! AFTER 30 MINUTES YOUR EARS ARE KILLING, AND YOU CANNOT LAY DOWN WHEN YOU ARE WEARING THEM. IT IS ALSO VERY DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST WOMEN WITH LONG HAIR BECAUSE THEY DONT WORK UNLESS YOUR HAIR IS IN A PONYTAIL!!!! SONY IS JERKS AND NEVER BUY FROM THEM!!!"
1,No Good,This is the worst thing ive ever owned from sony... a waste of money... it wont play any CD-Rs or CD/RW's and wont even play the new store bought cd i got yesterday...P.S. all those cds play in my friends cd player(Panasonic) to perfection... this is a crappy cd player... dont buy it
5,a great cd walkman,"I purchased this item used so I suspect it's not being made anymore by Sony; but this model is the best walkman I have ever owned. It uses power more slowly, has a nice sound and is shock-resistant though I've not tested that thoroughly."
5,"Excellent, cheap, no frills cd player","This is an excellent cd player, especially for the price. If you're looking for lots of fancy options, this one won't do but all the basics are here. It has a wide range of options on the volume control. It's relatively skip free (not good enough for exercizing with but fine other than that). The included headphones are decent quality, as long as you like the type that go behind your neck. Extremely long battery life is another plus. Mine has stood up to being dropped on a hardfloor and played with by a baby as well, so it's not flimsy. The only problem I have had was with disks that are dirty it will skip, but a quick cleaning of the disk fixes that problem."
4,buy it,"Its a good cd player, cool color, hasnt skipped for me yet when ive walked with it, you can set it down on the table and it wont skipp when it makes impact with the table. The headphones play outta both speakers, ive had alot of cd players that the head phones only played outta one speaker. the buttons are a little small and the play button on mine is whobbles easier than the others which can get annoying, but im kinda picky so maybe its just me, i wish the buttons were on the top so u can see what ur pressing, but other than that its a good cd player and u should buy it"
1,Do NOT buy Sony discmans!,"This discman looks decent, sounds pretty good, and works quite well. For a few months. I've had mine for about 4 months, and it has suddenly stopped working, seemingly for no reason. I thought this was quite strange (and lame, since I spent $50 on it), and then a friend of mine told me that he's owned a couple Sony discmans and they both stopped working after around 6 months of use.In addition to this, the buttons are too small, and rather awkwardly placed. Contrary to what the label says, it is most certainly not skip-free, and will skip under several different sets of circumstances. And to top it all off, the battery life isn't 40 hours. Not sure exactly what it is, but it's definitely under the claimed 40 hrs. If you're thinking of buying a discman, do yourself a favour and get a Panasonic. They last forever, and look cooler to boot."
1,this is lame,"this thing lasted two months and then broke down. It would always not play or skip constantly. I even tried a lense cleaner but it was so messed up it wounldn't even play. Take my advice and don't buy this product, it sucks!"
2,light and compact yet it sucks,"I bought this cd player at a decent price. I was suprised that it was very light, but it doesn't seem to play some cd-rw's. And this cd player gets alot of fingerprints on the cover which makes it look dirty and its slippery too. I would buy something better for a couple bucks more."
5,totally the best,"i bought this player after my old PHILLIPS died (those things lasers really die quickly). its a great player, the batteries that i have in it are duracel (?) and i have had the same ones in for about 2 months now - they haven't even started dying yet. woo hoo!! it plays my burned CD's perfectly, the sound is incredible, it gets rid of some of the little fuzzies on my older CD's and makes them sound like new. i love the headphones, street-style are my absolute fav, i can sleep with them on, and i dont have to pull my long hair up to wear them. it doesn't skip at all, i can be ridding on the school bus, a train, the subway, i can be jogging - it doesnt skip AT ALL. the only thing you can really complain about it is the little buttons, but i honestly don't have a problem with them - i can stick this in a big pocket of my cargos and BAM im set for the day. all my peers love it (15, 16, 17), and so do my older friends. totaly great player"
3,Not my favorite countertenor,"This has some good songs on it, but I really must admit that Dalton is simply too effeminate for my taste. Sing high, but sing like a man!"
1,Performs it's main function poorly,"Basically a great idea, except that the one thing that it needs to do, hold an offset, it doesn't do well. Too tight and you can't adjust it, too loose (which can seem like nice and tight) and it won't hold it's setting. I scuffed up the bearing surfaces with some course sandpaper, but it's still mediocre. I primarily use this tool for scribing chair legs once the chair is leveled for trimming. The ability to ride a flat reference, and extend a pencil a little bit if I need to is great, but it needs some knurled bearing surfaces or something, at least in the main elbow joint."
4,Great---mostly.,"Great idea and well built. I first saw it in a wooden boat magazine and thought it looked good. As a wood worker, drawing circles is a common problem. I've used it a couple times and have these observations:1. It holds it's position and measurement quite well.2. It is constructed of good materials.3. The pin pulls back for safe stage, but doesn't stay in the extended position without the help of a little electrical tape.4. I think it would be nice if the pin side would also swivel to allow larger circles.Would I recommend it? Yes, but the builder could improve their design a bit."
5,Great tool,I really liked the adjustments you can make on it to get that perfect scribe and that you can sharpen the pencil (which you can change with any other pencil in your shop) with the built in sharpener.
2,"Ok,not great","This tool is useful for about 20% of anything that I've scribed.It can't be used for anything that needs to be ""dead nuts"". The cheap little dollar scribe works a ton better and it only cost a buck!"
2,To Big,". This is all it says it will adjust every which way but it is so big I have no place in my carpenter's apron to put it. It works great for some things but it is just too big, so you can't carry it with you. You have to put it down which in construction does not work well you have to have it with you."
2,Flimsy construction,I have been impressed with other products from FastCap but this one is a loser. It fell apart the first day. I glued it back together but then experienced the loosening thumbscrew problems. I'll go back to the drugstore compass...
2,Disappointing,"I've tried to use this a few times, but it's almost completely worthless. It's too bulky to use for scribing small distances or in tight areas. It's plastic, so it flexes a little bit which precludes you from getting an accurate scribe. When I scribed a countertop backsplash, it left a nice gouge in the drywall. Back to an old-fashioned compass."
4,Nice tool,The joint makes it easy to work with. The only thing I would like to see changed is the pencil holder. I would like to be able to use a mechanical pencil or pen. The pencil provided (standard #2 pencil) is the only style that will fit. I'd buy it again.
4,Accuscribing,I recently bought this scribe and it looks like it's going to take some time to get use to. The problems I have had when using it is all the adjustments. It has three adjustment screws that take extra time to use. The old scribe tool I used had one. It is a little bulky also. It does the job but to me it seems like someone tried to invent a better mousetrap.
2,Not very solid,I guess I was expecting too much. The idea is there but the quality isn't. It gets out of adjustment too easily. Maybe if it was aluminum it would be sturdier.
4,Good piece of kit,"This is a good piece of kit,well made and very versatile,much better than a regular pair of compasses,I think this will be much used."
1,Different from picture shown,"The old model shown is not what you get. You will receive the ""New and Improved"" model that has a zipper pattern on the bottom that is loose, uneven and not flat. The original model has a strait flat seem and was a great tool. I bought 2 of the new models hoping the first was just a fluke and it was the same poor quality. If it's not broke why ""fix"" it? If anyone knows where to get an original model please let me know."
2,Not Great,"I have used this scriber for about 6 months now and have to admit to being disappointed by its performance. I was so looking forward to the flat edge allowing the scriber to run along the wall accurately and easily, but the tightening nut just won't tighten, and that causes so many problems I have finally taken it out of my bag and am going back to a compass. There is nothing more frustrating than running this thing along a wall and having the dimension change because the pencil slips a little.If they could figure out how to make that blasted nut tighten, this would be an easy five stars, but as it stands I have given up on it."
5,works great,"Why didn't someone think of this sooner, it gave an perfect duplicate scribe of the wall I was installing a counter top against. Now all my workers want one."
2,I tossed mine,"Cheap plastic, doesn't hold adjustments, clunky and awkward. I bought it initially for the broad, flat surface, thinking this ideal for wall and floor scribing, and because the brass parts made it appear to be better than it is. I found it almost unusable, tried to get used to it for a while and finally tossed it. 2 stars for minimum usability. I recommend the tried and true compass or dividers. If you want a high-quality set, try West Marine - they have quite a variety for charting purposes. Stay away from the cheap stamped steel school models, and don't buy a set without a lock. A very good set is the C.S. Osborne model carried by Woodcraft. It is heavy-duty and has a nice fine adjust mechanism. Pricey at about $65-$70, but will last a lifetime."
5,Graham Webb Vivid Color color locking shampoo,Graham Webb Vivid Color color locking shampoo is the best shampoo I have ever used. I use alot of hair spray on my hair and this shampoo cuts right through the heavy hair spray and really cleans great!
3,Better solo violin and cello exist,"I do not know why DG put Maisky and Mintz on this album. I don't like how they interpret Bach. They're just really terrible. This is bach for people who hate bach. For the solo cello, I suggest Maurice Gendron on the Philips label, and for the solo violin, I suggest Arthur Grumiaux also on the Philips label. For the violin:Bach: Complete Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violinand the following for the cello:Bach: The 6 Cello Suites. Or just try Yo Yo Ma for crying out loud, but avoid Minsky and Mintz at all costs. That said, Solcher is very good and I enjoy his performances, but Mintz and Maisky, I don't know what they were thinking."
1,talking tp roll that doesn't work,"doesn't work.very disappointedwaste of time and money not happy at all , would not recommend it to my worst enemy"
3,Fun that dies early,At first this was funny. My wife wants to kill it at this point.Easy to use. Kind of tricky to get to the battery compartment without directions.
2,"Funny, but a bit too long","IF you can get it into te TP holder, it is funny to use. The major problem is that it doesn't compress enough to inset into all of the TP holders I've tried. I was able to force it into one holder, but it took a lot of force.I would NOT buy it again."
4,Hilarious but message is short,This is a hilarious gag gift - will also fit into a kitchen roll holder. I'd love a longer message though.
2,Not what I thought it would be.,"I always read reviews before I buy things. I thought I could record a couple different messages, but you can't. You can only record 1 message up to 9 seconds long."
5,A little gem !,Bought this andHow to Poo at Workfor my daughter for Christmas - it's great ! Makes you want to play with it everytime you visit the loo. Will be getting another for my Dad's birthday.
5,Royal Flush,"Absolutely wonderful gag. I couldn't have thought this one up myself, but its great! Very, very funny. You can custom record whatever message you want, and it works as soon as someone tugs on the old tissue paper. Doesn't go off randomly. Its the best gag this year! ;-)"
4,Clever idea and great for laughs,"Arrived in good condition, packaged in shrink-wrap for protection. Directions are sparse and not very clear, took me a few minutes to figure out how to locate and open the battery compartment. Recordings from the website (talkingtp.com) are not very clear, but from other recordings or your own voice are plenty loud and clear. My favorites so far are ""Don't forget to flush,"" and ""Please remain seated for the performance."" I've only had the product for a couple weeks, but so far it's holding up fine and no issues with needing to replace battery. A bit of a tight fit into the TP holder but with a little patience and maneuvering it will fit."
5,You Record the Message,"Fun little item. You add you own message to it and it adds a little entertainment for your friends. Packed in a little plastic card to keep it clean and unscratched, but not crushed. It did arrive fine so there were no issues, and I have no idea how long it will last."
2,Awesome if it was reliable,"It was really cool when it worked, but it would erase after a couple times used and it ate batteries incredibly fast."
1,did not work at all,"I bought this item and it never worked, this is the second time I purchased this item from two different sources with the same problem. If the item is defective I suggest that you recall them."
3,Funny,"The Talking TP Toilet Spindle was a lot of laughs , only problem is it was barely long enough to stay in the holder or it would be 5 stars"
4,"nephew loved it, quick and easy to assemble","This was a Christmas gift for my nephew. He loved the Batman rode it all over the place. Was real quick and easy to assemble, bike seemed real sturdy, good quality, nice training wheels."
4,Sportsman's Travelogue of USA,The adventures of Jime Fergus and his lab Sweetzer as chronicled in this book make me wish I had chosen a much less restricted life style over my 60+ years up to now. The writing creates strong images in my mind's eye that bring the events to life for me. I enjoyed the book immensely and recommend it highly.
2,NOT ONE OF MY BETTER PURCHASES.,"I love to buy for value. You know, excellent product for the price. This is very lite weight. Wind blows it up into the gutter and it get's hung up. The flag I was replacing was very heavy duty but faded in about one year in the San Diego sun. I would recommend you consider another flag. My wife will unstitch the bottom hem and slide in something heavy to stop the problem we have.We have had to do that with some years back with a flag we had. It works. Also, the pole and parts are not that great of quality."
4,Not Cream but surprisingly good,"Dug this out of a stack of cd's that fell on the floor. Hadn't listened to it in years. Cream it ain't, but I was pleased to hear Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker, and Gary Moore, sound this good. Gary Moore does a decent impersonation of old Clapton (which not even Clapton himself sounds anything like anymore, although the upcoming Cream get-together is happening in 5/2005; we'll see what happens there!). Baker's drumming sounds really clean, and Jack Bruce's voice is in good form (although I thought his bass was a little low in the mix). Moore's vocals (about half of the vocals) are decent; remind me of Stevie Ray. All in all, a good effort; too bad they only recorded this one recording. As some other reviewer pointed out, there is virtually no documentation that comes with the cd."
5,Simply great.,"Simply great. If you like Cream, you'll love BBM. Very professional and creative. We give this CD as gifts to people who love blues-rock."
2,You have heard this before,"I heard the track City of Gold on the radio, and had to get this CD! Sad to say, what a disappointment. The rest of the CD doesn't even come close. All of the comparisons to Cream are on the money - heck, the guys are FROM Cream. The problem is, it sounds just like Cream on some tracks, note for note! If you are a huge Cream fan, this is for you. If you want something in that genre, but original, I'd say pass this one by."
2,"oops, a bad lunge at pop music","This one record wonder came together at Jack Bruce's 50th birthday concert with an energetic set of old Cream tunes. If only they would have let that be. The problem here is not musicianship or production. It's laughably bad songwriting. A stack of old Cream classics are rewritten with lousy lyrics, beginning with the first track. Bruce sings poorly for most of the record, as if he knows it's a bomb. There are some occasional bright spots: High Cost of Loving is the 'Born Under a Bad Sign' replacement, and its a better performance. The single, 'Where in the World', is a subtle recasting of 'Passing the Time' and it's only shortcoming is a lousy Bruce vocal on the bridge. And the final three tracks forget about Cream and stand on their own."
4,Great Service,I was slightly disappointed in the content of the dvd but the service was great.. i'll use them again.
4,The Real Thing!,I have some experience with the MD. State Juvenile Corrections System and this documentry is a realistic look at what these young ladies experience. We are using it as an educational tool for some at risk girls and it really held their interest.
4,Great Documentary,The documentary does a pretty good job showing factors that lead to girls' delinquency and violence. It's refreshing to see a documentary from the girls' prospective where their voices are providing language and terminology to discuss their experiences.
4,Stimulates the Mind,"My daughter received two of this item and one of the Strawberry Shortcake Bead Kits. She loves both kits. I appreciate the idea that she is able to use her time playing with something stimulating for her brain. A bonus to purchasing this item is that a child can play by themselves or with a friend/parent. Also, a child can play with it no matter what the weather is outside. I do wish the craft kit came in a carrying case versus the flimsy box. Add a case and I would have given it a 5."
1,Again,"out of step w/ other reviewers. I thought it was gross that the Hero had a years-long relationship w/ another woman, loving her deeply but offering nothing. That's because - Surprise! - he was married to the heroine. Secretly. As soon as the Other, Beloved, Woman was removed from the scene (cause she's abducted by a sheikh in another book), Hero turns up at Heroine's doorstep. She melts at his feet, has sex w/ him like there's no tomorrow, then he leaves divorce papers on her table?Even though the secret marriage was to protect Heroine from said sheikh...Ick. No real love in either of these books, except that between the Hero in this one & the abducted bride in the other. In this book, ""discovering"" that you've loved each other all along - while falling in love w/ other women, having affairs, whatever - is just totally unbelievable and unenjoyable to me. Could not suspend disbelief on any level to engage w/ these characters."
2,"Not horrible, but not good","I ordered four different varieties of Fantastic Foods Soup Cups. Of all the ones I ordered, my wife and I were most excited about the Split Pea. We both love split pea soup.Well, of all the flavors we ordered, this was my least favorite. The other Fantastic Food Soup Cups had very bold flavors, but the flavor of this one was just blah. Almsot not even there. The texture wasn't the best either. The rehydrating just doesn't happen very well.It was definately palatable, but not good.Some of the other flavors are pretty good though."
1,Rapture,"Well , seing all this review's make me question his trip any church going person will know that you go to heaven"
5,A great book!,"Hell is a real place and this book really gives a deeper teaching on Hell than most people have ever heard of. Simply put, a real eye opener."
5,An amazing testimony!,This book contains some of the deep secrets of the word of God! Many ancient mysteries are finally revealed!
5,WOW! What a great book!,"If you have loved ones who are living a wicked lifestyle, you will want them to read this book. This book will leave an impression on anyone for God's glory!"
2,disapointed,I really thought I would like this product since I like the rx line but I was disapointed. After a few chews the flavor is completely out of thid gum and it has no taste. I will continue to buy the other products however.
5,Falsetto Master Ronnie Walker you Decide,"Another fine example of high quality soul music, just waiting to be discovered. Ronnie Walker recorded his first singles at age 15(Im saying goodbye/My baby doesn't love me anymore) both included on this 22 track cd on Philly Archives. His soaring falsetto voice should be mentioned along side Eddie Kendricks and the delfonics just to name a few. His top 10 Philly AM radio soul hit Really,Really love you is here plus 10 previously unreleased tracks. Also a gifted song writer, he wrote for Esther Phillips, Fat Larrys Band and for a truly odd paring Charo's million selling Cuchi Cuchi which he never received royalty money. If the music wasn't enough, theres informative liner notes with vintage soul music charts, session information and rare photos. Good Music, Good Package you decide."
4,Easy Polish,This product is easy to use and the car looks great after. It seems to repel the water well too.
4,Quick and fast detailing,"As its name, the instant detailer does it job quickly. I give it 4 stars since it does its job. However, I rather spend money to something else. For car outside, you should use the right product to make the waxing/polishing job last long. For car inside, you use plastic/vinyl protection on your leather/vinyl/plastic and fabric cleaning with good smell to do the job. The product has OK smell but not that great."
4,Ok but not great,The good news is that this is easy to spray on and wipe off. The spray handle gives a fine mist that covers a good area. The spray wipes off easily. The bad news is that the shine is not much better than if I had just washed it and left it. Maybe it will get better over time as the coating builds up. It also streaks a bit but this is minimized if you use a good microfiber cloth. It's good stuff but doesn't give me the kind of shine I would get from a regular wax job.
5,Writing as a Way of Healing: How Telling Our Stories Transforms Our Lives,"It took more than what I wanted to received the book, but the service was very good. They even sent it with a return label, in case I didn't want it anymore. It is a MUST read book."
3,disapointing.,I felt the author was telling me not to write unless I thought about it - which kind of defeats the purpose of my own stream of consciousness style. I stopped writing after I started reading the book. Writing to Heal the Soul by Zimmerman is much better.
1,Superficial,"This was a big disappointment. It read like a too-long term paper summarizing notes on how writing helped writers, repeating endlessly that writing can help emotional healing if it combines description of events as well as reactions -- but it can make you worse, so have a therapist as backup. I found the author condescending, referring to beginners as ""baby writers,"" and the advice to just write write write was the standard pedestrian stuff."
3,Should we do what Virginia did?,"This book presents Virginia Woolf as an example of someone who used writing for healing. But how much did writing really help Woolf? Woolf committed suicide. To me that indicates that any healing methods she used were inadequate.When this book arrived in the mail I was excited and hopeful. Then I opened it and almost immediately saw Virginia Woolf's name. My heart sank. I make it a practice never to take the advice of people who eventually commit suicide. Rather, I study their lives to learn what NOT to do.A better book on the same topic is ""Opening Up: The Healing Power of Expressing Emotions"" by James Pennebaker. It's based solidly on research, not on the literature of suicides."
4,Great Read! One of the best books on healing writing today.,"The subject of journaling for vanity or healing is becoming chic. There is a lot of superficial books out there but this is not one of them. I suffer from combat PTSD and have been journaling for two years. I wish her book had come out two years ago. I devowered her work in one sitting. Well worth the time, effort and money. A ""stand-out"" work."
5,A treasured GEM of a book!!,"I recently published my first memoir, a catharsis from a true crime experience from thirty years ago. I wish I had found this book sooner....it is magnificent! Everything I had originally thought, this book verified for me..Anyone who is even considering writing memoir should read this book. I've read many books on writing from the soul, but this book topped them all."
4,Encouragement for the writer in each of us,"DeSalvo writes from personal experience, from understanding the prison of secrets/pain/abuse/emotional trauma, and she does so in a simple format that encourages us all to come to grips with our demons. Having written poems while in Vietnam while a Battalion Surgeon for the USMC as means of codifing pain to make it tolerable, I have been in DeSalvo's ""trenches"". But in reading this warm little book I am returning to that personal prison and this time, with DeSalvo's help I think I might stand a better chance to get it right! Even if you are not interested in writing, this book is so nurturing in its approach to dealing with buried or hidden trauma that it is almost guaranteed to help all sensitive readers read...and live...better."
5,A transformative book,"Louise DeSalvo has offered an incredibly valuable resource to anyone interested in writing from the heart, whether for publication or just for themselves. What struck me most, besides her own personal courage and breadth of knowledge about literature and other writers, was how incredibly accessible she makes the writing process. So often we think of books as springing fully formed from the head of Zeus when in actuality a lot of murkiness and revision takes place before the work truly reveals itself to the author. This isn't just for the creative writer either; I found it very helpful for my academic writing and her suggestions for reflecting on each person's own writing process and studying it to determine what your optimal writing conditions are has been crucial in making me a happier and more productive writier."
4,Very Inspirational,"Although the book was not quite what I was expecting, i.e. a book that teaches you how to journal, I found it exceptional nonetheless. It was inspirational as it shared stories of other writers who write to save their sanity and souls. It also offered useful techniques to get you thinking about your memories and how to record them.I highly recommend this very readable book."
3,Spine-tingeling Thriller,"This book is about Dilly, a girl who is afraid of water, ever since her mother drown and she was close. When she goes to the beach, she meets a guy there that she likes. After a while she finds out something about him that makes her worry for her life!"
1,Cruelty Without Beauty,"This book is not without its pleasures. Harris writes with a breathless malice that is sometimes hysterical, in every sense of the word. But his targets are easy ones, and his jeremiads are for the most part devoid of nuance. Ultimately, it seems that everything that was GOOD about gay culture just happened to coincide with Harris's lost youth. Before the 1970's everything gays did was an example of their all-encompassing self-hatred; since the 1970's, everything gays do is crass, commercial, and rabidly assimilationist. These themes have been tackled more intelligently in other works, e.g. Mark Simpson's ""Anti-gay."" Sadly, by the last pages of ""Rise and Fall"" one cannot help but see Daniel Harris as an angry unloved child locked out in the rain, hammering snails on the sidewalk."
4,"Don't Agree With Everything Harris Says, But ...","I can't say I agree with everything Harris says in the book, but I extend a hearty ""thank you"" for bridging some issues that need to be talked about. His analysis of Gay pornography's progression from films of the 70's that portrayed sex as something that happened to everyday people in real places to today's videos where sex resembles some kind of sterile medical procedure among bodybuilders is probably the best summation of his thesis. His book examines the creation of the prepackaged, instant, just add water Gay male that has occurred as target marketing and image building has taken precedence over the needs and feeling of people."
5,Acid Bath: The Hilarious Horrors of Gay Culture,"Bring out the boas-let the party begin! After a decade of pusillanimous, word-clotted academic eructations masquerading as ""queer theory,"" Daniel Harris has single-handedly restored the reputation of gay intellectuals as bitches. His hateful new book, ""The Rise and Fall of Gay Culture,"" is a shrewd and pitiless polemic on the current crisis of gay identity, and should be savored by every homo whose brain has not yet been cauterized by crystal or stultified by steroids. Harris' dissection of our so-called ""culture"" is intentionally lacerating-a Socratic slap in the face. Knowing oneself is rarely this much fun.The complete review may be found at:http://www.daimonix.com/fictions/harris.html"
5,Outstanding and Overall Amazing,"This is probably one of the best anime's out there if you looking to have a little bit of everything wrapped into one. I bought this set based on some reviews I read about it online and not only was I satisfied I was also glad that I purchased it. The characters are amazing, the stories can range from sad to romance to funny. I was left wanting more so not only do I recommend picking up this set but I also recommend picking up the manga's from it as well because the anime only covers the first 7 volumes out of 23 and I guarantee you will want to know what happens with these characters after the anime. Also don't listen to people saying this is for girls because I'm a guy and I really enjoyed this, pick it up immediately."
4,A Different Kind of Romance,"I have all the DVDs that have come out so far and their great. This is a great series that shows that being innocence is maybe the greatest gift that you have, and simply understanding how people think and feel your greatest accomplishment. Fruit Basket shows so pretty hard times for the Soma family but it also shows how people can triumph over adversity and their hardships. This is a really romance series, not because there's a lot of kissing and stuff like that. But that you can really see the romantic natures that exist in some of the most unlikely characters. I wish that the ending of DVD four came to more of an conclusion like who the main female character ends up with, and not to mention that not all the members of the Chinese zodiac appeared so hopefully that means there is more DVDs on there way."
5,This box set is in English,"I bought this bought set back when I was in 8th grade so about 6 years ago. It is a wonderful series, full of love, laughs, drama, and of course romance. It was my first anime purchase. I will always hold it dearly in my heart."
5,Don't judge an Anime by it's name,"At first I was skeptical about watching a anime called Fruits Basket. I did a little research and decided to give it a try. I am sure glad that I did. I thought that this was perhaps the best anime that i have ever seen, and I have seen alot of anime. I loved the characters that appeared through each of the episodes. Each one had a problem that they needed to work through, it wasn't all fun and games. I think you go through all the human emotions when you watch this one..but don't worry there is comedy and some fighting for all you guys out there...The only thing that I did not like is that there are not more episodes."
3,Okay,"It started and finished decent, but becomes redundant in the middle of the series. The middle didn't really do anything story wise and introduced some annoying characters. I almost didn't finish watching it but I did and the last few episodes got interesting."
4,Not too shabby,"It was pretty good. Thought it got lost in the military mail system, but it still got here faster than I thought it would."
5,Wonderful,"Just what I was looking for, and at a great price! The box and the dvds are gorgeous, and the extras are great too."
5,Love,"Fast Shipment,Nice Box Set I would Highly recommend it,I enjoy the Fruit Basket Love the Plot line :)"
4,Good story,"This anime is about a young girl in a sad situation and the friends that she has and develops. It is a good story, but probably enjoyed most by those that like relationship based stories. No action in this one."
3,This story is amazing!,"I love Fruits Basket, it was the first anime I ever say and it is by far my favorite. I only gave this three stars because when it arrived, there were dents in the packaging and the DVD's were all scratched."
5,This is a great series to own!,This series is amazing! I only wish there was a second series. It has great messages and I enjoyed seeing the zodiac story played out. It even made me cry haha
5,Great DVD!,"I bought this for my daughter's birthday because she is crazy about Fruits Basket. She was so excited. The DVD played great, very happy with my purchase."
2,Bad Fit,"Our newborn needed to be swaddled in order to sleep, so we tried a variety of brands. We found this one to be the worst for us. We tried using it from the time our son was just born (8 lbs) to 2 months old and it never fit. Although the package says birth +, it was always too big for him. The velcro pad is located in the wrong place and could not get a tight fit for a swaddle. I was extremely disappointed as it is wonderful, light material and has the directions cleverly printed on the inner pocket. However, due to the poor fit, we were unable to use any of them."
3,Not small enough for my newborn,"I purchased this item right after I brought my son home from the hospital. I wanted to swaddle him but I found that receiving blankets just weren't big enough and he would wiggle right out of them. However, I found that these didn't exactly ""swaddle"" him as they were more of a wrap. Swaddling is suppose to hold the baby rather snug to simulate the womb and is suppose to be calming, but these were actually too big to get that effect and he had too much wiggle room!!"
2,"""Multi-user""??","I have a small business where 3 people need access to Invoices, POs and inventory. It seems, If you want to do anything of any impotence, you have to go to single user mode. For example; importing customers, anything with inventory, anything with vendors. All anyone can do in multi-user mode is create invoices and POs. It was a waist of money for us as we still find ourselves in single user mode most of the time. Oh, and the there are tuns of ""OK"" buttons to press. Every time you tell it to do something, expect to press at least 2 ""OK"" buttons before it will do it. Don't tell me ""QB is now ready to..."" do something, JUST DO IT. All in all, it's pretty much the same thing as the QB Pro. If you are like us, and need more people to access information, I suggest upgrading to something else."
4,"Love the Material, Not So Nuts About the Author","I've read about 75% of EVERYTHING Tracy has put out. I must say I think he really does get what he's talking about, and once applied, it works. For that reason alone I bought this book, and it doesn't disappoint. I've recently been out of work and have time on my hands, but in my last role (and for my next) I find that time becomes elusive. Tracy suggests not only strategies to take control, but also changing the whole perception of time. I'm looking forward to applying everything from this in my next job, and my life.I can't, however, give this a 5 star rating, as I've seen him speak, and he is so insanely right-wing that it left forever a sour taste in my mouth. I'll keep reading him, but never attend again. Sue"
4,Love It,I always loved this series and Batman so naturally i had to have this collection. It's a much have for even a casual fan.
1,More Double sided Discs,When I saw this was being released I thought Superman would finally be available in the same quality as all the other products in DCAU. But no. This is still going to have the two sided discs which get scratched to easily and just don't seem to have the quality. I would have bought it otherwise. The one good thing about this is it is reasonably priced unlike the complete Batman and soon to be released complete Justice league which cost more than the individual seasons combined.
3,Package was missing a DVD but...,"it contained 2 copies of the same disk. Unfortunately, the duplicate was one of the double sided disks, so now I have about 10 duplicate episodes and missing 10 episodes. The episodes I do have are great though."
1,They should give it a proper release,"It's like 3 episodes per disc on each side. That was the problem with the volume sets. Then now, they just slap on those god-awful double side disc and says the complete superman collection. I mean the Batman animated series the complete animated series dvd set got a much better complete collection dvd release then this. I'm highly dissapointed."
1,this series deserves to be treated better than this,"they're repackaging the scratch prone double sided discs from the individual sets, my rating might seem harsh but companies should improve their product when they double dip, and they won't as long as consumers keep accepting things as they are"
3,Collectors Only,"Another figure from the Kingdom Come series, a graphic novel based on the future of our beloved heroes. This is Flash's daughter, Kid Flash. This figure makes a better collection peice then a toy, like the rest of the series."
4,Good Read!,"I don't know about putting Ms Fredd in the same catergory with Mrs. Jackson, Ms. Ray, and Ms Ford, but the book was good. This is not my first book by Ms Fredd, I loved ""If You Only Knew."" Go get both books!"
4,A Great Guide with everything,"Well, if you've played Armored Core 2, you know that simply beating the missions and arena challenges in the quickest and most deliberate way is not that enjoyable. The official Prima guide is great for anybody who gets stuck in a mission, or is trying to find all those pesky hidden AC parts. It offers top-notch Arena strategy, and has wonderful information on how best to equip your own AC to be the most effective in the missions.... You do not have to have this guide to get through the game, but I do reccommend it if you want to enjoy Armored Core 2 to the fullest."
2,"Should have been an article, not a book","The material here might have been considerably better served had it been edited down to a journal article size. Additionally, there are a number of typographical and spelling errors that distract from or alter the meaning of the text, including one in the table of contents' description of the first chapter! Also, the preface refers several times to Conrad's novelette as ""The Heart of Darkness,"" but further into the book, the authors seem to have learned that there is no ""The"" in the title. Might seem nit picky to some, but I believe that any teacher of English literature would know this, and so it is difficult to avoid wondering just how much one can trust this text.I do like the idea of the ""triangular"" seating arrangement."
4,Good introduction for beginners,"The beginner in Automaitc Speech Recognition should read this book. It introduces all the basics of signal processing and vocal tract modeling needed and provides good descriptions of modern algorithms for statistical speech recognition (such as dynamic programmation, Hidden Markov Models, Viterbi Algorithm ...)."
3,Good but contaminated with Linear Predictive Coding,"Since this book misguides students of speech signal processing with the outdated compression technique of Linear Predictive Coding (LPC, which is far inferior to cepstral vocoding because of LPC's stateful memory of voiced excitation from one frame to the next), it ought to be half the price of Jelinek's book, not twice."
4,Old book but nothing has changed since,"This book is relatively old, but nothing has changed int eh speech recognition field since a few decades now. So the materials is pretty standard and well explained."
4,"Chance, Disaster and Human Triangles","An amazing historical novel about survival and human failure on the Oregonfrontier. Chance failures of a shipwreck, a forest fire and human weaknessbrought out by extremes of natural exposure lead to violenceand a spiral of death.Only love can redeem the bleakness of this landscape.My family history dealing with logging and a saw mill makes me appreciatethe writing and chacterization."
4,Stefan Harris,"I really loved the treatment of the Gil Evans tune, the orchestration is rich and the playing is first rate. First I was a little put off by the drum sound which is ""modern"", but after two listening I really started to dig it. Stefan is a great writer and a fantastic player, a rare combination - plus his reverence to Ellington and Evans shines through."
1,Too big to fit in charger of casio Exilim EX-Z60,"Battery is about 1mm longer and wider than original casio NP-20 it was intended to replace, it is too big to fit in the charger (BC-11L), therefore unusable. Original battery fits easily in the charger. It may work for other applications, but definitely not for the EX-Z60 with the BC-11L charger."
3,Good BUT!!!,"The notebook is a great combo of power and featuresBUT:1. the speakers are awful2. the keyboard is loud and cheap feeling3. My Lcd display went bad after a month of use, which makes me wonder how long this notebook will last past its warranty period."
3,A few real gems worth unearthing,"Is this the Rolling Stones' best record? God, no. But it is certianly not their worst, either. I can't believe these reviews that say they sound like they don't care. On the contrary, it sounds to me that there is a lot of emotion in this album. Most of it, however, adds up to anger and rage. But hey, what's Rock 'n Roll without a dash of spite? If you ask me, it's defenetly an improvement over the bland and forgettable Tattoo You.Songs like Undercover Of The Night, Wanna Hold You (one of Keith's best), Too Tough, and All The Way Down make this an album worth owning (although you might be better off buying it on vinyl at a used records store for $3-4). They really rank among the Stones' best rockers. But then there's also throwaway trash like Too Much Blood (one of their worst songs ever). If you take the better songs off of this and Dirty Work, you could come up with one kick a$$ mix tape."
3,The Terrain Gets Rocky For The Stones,"The battle for leadership in the band exploded in the early-1980s between Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, with it spilling onto the vinyl in this November 1983 release.At its best, the politically-charged, Undercover in the Night, midnight rambling of She Was Hot and It Must Be Hell are solid additions to the legendary discography.But the posturing on cuts like Tie You Up (The Pain Of Love), Pretty Beat Up and All The Way Down sound more in tune with the self-indulgent silliness of any number of generic arena rock bands of this era.And where the merging of rock, reggae/disco, and new wave was successful in the 1978 album, Some Girls, the pulling from this wealth of musical sources for Undercover sounds - at times - to be very forced.A transitional album in many ways, it is one of the more frustrating and fascinating releases in the band's historic career."
4,Discover Undercover,"Undercover was the third studio album released by the Stones in the 1980s. None of the songs included in this record was an instant classic as Start me up had been two years before. But Undercover is a pretty solid album. She was hot is as good as Hang Fire had been in Tatto You. Pretty beat up is more interesting than Neighbours had been 2 years before. Too tough has a pretty powerful riff. Undercover of the Night and Too much blood were the big hits of this record. But I think that Feel on Baby is a much better songs. It conquers you little by little. In Undercover, Keith sings Wanna hold you which represents a follow up to what Little T & A had been in Tatto You.It's a very solid record and it's really a pity that it has not been appreciated as much as it should have."
3,What's So Bad About This Album?,"I'e read a lot of reviews elsewhere which totally pan this album. To tell you the truth, I like this one more than I do Tattoo You. It's delving into the 80's pop sound, but there's still enough Stones in it to keep it afloat. ""Undercover of the Night"" and ""She Was Hot"" are the most enduring, and definitely are two of the best. ""All the Way Down"" shines like a gem, Keith's ""Wanna Hold You"" rocks out, and ""Too Much Blood"" is an odd, quirky song about a cannibal, chainsaw massacres, etc. Hm... Anyway, it's a great album, not up there with ones like Beggar's Banquet or Exile On Main Street by far, but it's still a great one."
4,HOW CAN ANYONE OVERLOOK THIS ALBUM???,"Give me a break! If only people would sit down and really listen to this, they might find some gems here. My faves are ""She Was Hot"", ""Wanna Hold You"", and ""All The Way Down"", not to mention the title cut. I also like ""Too Tough"" and ""It Must Be Hell"". Mick, Keith and the rest of the gang enjoying themselves, and making great music while they're doing it. This CD is worth the money."
2,Undercover this one once in a while,"I have just about all the Stones albums they've made and this isn't one of my favorites.It's not a bad album its just well,poorly produced and thrown together quickly.Charlie Watts drums sound tinny like a coffee can{PLASTIC} and the instruments sound off.The thing about the time period when this was first made was mid to late 80's and it really was an awkward time for albums.This album is good for parties and nostalgia but for classic stone fans it's in no way shape or form ever match up to SOME GIRLS or STICKY FINGERS..Thank God for that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"""Raw and vicious"" is right","Even for the Stones, this is an especially harsh and abrasive collection... absolutely deadening stuff. At this point they really needed to listen to Mark Knopfler or The Grateful Dead to remind themselves of what music is really all about... This is absolutely one of the most gosh-awful albums I've ever heard--and there haven't been many this offensively bad. Do yourself a favour and spend your money elsewhere."
2,One of the worst Rolling Stones albums,"I had been trying to find a copy of ""undercover"" in the stores for some time, it seems as though the stones have gone to great lengths to keep this album as well as ""dirty work"" off the shelves. I still wanted the album b/c I have all the other stone's cds, so I bought a used copy. This album is just plain poor. There isn't a single stand-out track on the cd, it's just bad. I also ordered a copy of ""Dirty Work"" which I've heard is even worse... We'll see. If you want to buy a great Stones record, buy ""let it bleed,"" ""beggars banquet,"" ""Sticky Fingers,"" Exile on Main Street,"" ""Goat's Head Soup,"" ""It's Only Rock n' roll,"" or ""Some Girls"" - these are the best Stone's records in my opinion."
3,the very last interesting release from these fossils,"at the very least,undercover has a very unique feel in contrast with everything else in their catatlog. and that feel is blood, guts & violence. what these lazy millionaires felt so angry i dont know (tax problems? keith lose his drivers license again?) but its interesting anyway. undercover is a great song, possibly the last imaginative thing they recorded, but its the only classic. wanna hold you is definitely one of keiths better contributions but sounds out of place. all of what used to be side two (from too much blood to the end) is worth a listen or two but not much more. she was hot IS better than she's so cold, but pretty run of the mill. and feel on baby is easily the WORST song the stones did EVER! rather than buy this, tape the good songs off someone elses copy. mick is a joke."
1,THIS IS STILL IN PRINT?,"HOW FAR DOWN CAN THEY GO? HOW ABOUT TITLES LIKE ""TOO MUCH BLOOD"" ""TIE YOU UP"" AND ""TOO TOUGH"". THE FACT IS ""THE WORLDS GREATEST ROCK AND ROLL BAND"" GAVE UP CARING LONG AGO,FULL WELL KNOWING THAT THEY CAN RELEASE A ALBUM OF PURE BILGEWATER LIKE THIS AND SOME FANS WILL STILL RUN OUT AND BUY IT. FOLKS, THE GLORY DAYS ARE LONG GONE, THIS IS JUST ANOTHER CLUNKER TOO ADD TO THEIR POST 1973 LIST!"
1,Are you kidding me?,They can remaster this piece of crap 10 more times and still wouldn't make this a good album... The worst album of the stones that I care bout to listen to... Everything after tattoo you sucks
1,Fragile,"Do not recomend it. Yes it's pretty, but it breaks too easily.Mine broke 2 months after the purchase. Waste of money."
4,Xandros Desktop Home Edition Premium V4,"It installed easy and found my wifi driver, which is fairly new.I find the response is better than Microsoft 2000 Pro. OSIt did not find my DELL 120 printer driver, which is really a Lexmark 610.All things said I will not miss the ""Blue Screen of Death."
2,Xandros Desktop Home Edition Premium V4,"Xandros is OK but much to technical for a Windows user. It requires a knowledge of Linux. The first thing they tell you is don't use Root. Most Windows users wouldn't know what you are talking about. Linspire 5.0 is a much better product for this type user. I would say if you know Linux, then buy this product. If you are coming from Windows, buy Linspire."
2,Not very good but I had no choice,"My anatomy class dissected following this book so I was stuck having to flip through sticky pages full of vague directions that often skipped many steps and illustrations that frequently badly lacked detail. If you have to use this book, your best bet is to learn the anatomy using Gray's and use primarily that knowledge when dissecting (once you know the anatomy the dissection becomes pretty straightforward and you don't have to muck through this mess)."
4,"Not great, but quite good","This book presents usable advice and routines to aid practicing. As stated by another, nothing that hasn't necessarily been written about elsewhere and certainly nothing revolutionary, but the fact that it's all in one volume, with pictures, and that's it's good, makes it worth buying and the advice worth trying. Some minor flaws here and there might confuse a raw novice, but I can't imagine that anyone even remotely familiar with Cowboy Action Shooting would be thrown by any of those, and people already in the sport are the target for this book anyway."
2,CSA guide,"Not as good as I'd hoped for. Written by a guy who may know how to shoot at Cowboy events, but does not transfer this knowledge to the reader.A disappointing read, to say the least. Did not present any information I hadn't already come across in other publications.It brings to mind another person just looking to cash in on publishing a book about a little written of subject."
4,Donne-moi des vacances!,"Two friends from a French inner-city dream of getting away to the sunshine. They try various means of raising money and stowing away in caravans and coaches to half live out their dream. This is set against their relationships with their families (petty criminal brother, loving mothers etc.).Contains some genuinely amusing moments as well as the tristesse of their lives."
4,"excellent effort., well worth buying","This the first guidebook by a major publisher to this wonderful country. The book has a couple of quirks but makes up for itwith lots of detail and a real passion for the country.It's a huge leap forward from the 'Georgia with Armenia' book previously published by Bradt. There are maps for each marz (province) and a smattering of city maps - Yerevan, Gyumri and Ejmiatsin. My main quibbles is that the selection of restaurants in Yerevan isn't as good as it could have been, and that the author has a clear fascination for trains which may not be shared by all readers. For example, most of the space devoted to Kapan, one of the nicer regional cities, refers to the trains and carriages stranded there. Otherwise, it's well written and obviously very thoroughly researched. The only place I can see which was missed is the Amaras monastery in Karabakh."
3,good effort,"I agree with the other reviewer - it's a good effort and fairly well written. My main issues with this book are 1) that the photographs are incredibly bleak. If I had not visited Armenia last year, I definitely would not have based on the pictures. 2) The Nagorno Karabagh section was very light. It basically seemed like an after thought that was tacked on the last minute."
2,Great product but $$$,Love Mustela products great on my preemie stays on very well. 2 stars because for 0.5 Fl OZ such small amount it's very pricy.
4,Good Product - very pricey,"I love the product and the confidence that I have in the brand Mustela, however, it is really pricey for such a small quantity. I live in Hawaii, where sun exposure is obviously a factor, and I could use this product up in a week's time."
2,"Only demonstration, not a routine","After reading all of the reviews on this video, I bought it and couldn't wait to get it. It was nothing like I was expecting. I expected some sort of routine with longer stretches,(something similar to the Tamilee Total Stretch video but a little more difficult) not just quick demonstrations. I am not extremely flexible at all and really wanted something to help me out. I hate the fact that I have to pause after every single part of the demonstration to do the stretch longer on my own. I'm very disappointed."
2,Not a very good stretching DVD...,I was greatly disappointed with the quality and length of the DVD. It really seemed amatuerish and just wasn't very informative.
4,I just wish the lower body stretches were held a little longer,"I do like this DVD--Stacey Nemour is very attractive and has a charming personality. When I follow her suggestion and do the stretches consistently, I do achieve a lot more flexibility. My only complaint is that the sequences of the stretches are not long enough. The pace is so fast that I have to do them on my own to hold them long enough. I think maybe she had that in mind when she filmed the DVD. She is teaching you the stretches so you can do them on your own. Some of the stretches against a wall were completely new to me, so if I had not bought the DVD I would not have known about them--and they work. All in all, I would definitely recommend it to someone who wants to increase their flexibility and is always looking for new ways to do it."
4,fast effective,Its a fairly fast tape but the moves work ive been using for about two weeks and am already about an inch an a half closer to my full split!!!
5,Absolutely a GREAT VALUE!,"This set of 5 CD's of classical guitar from debate-ably the world's greatest classical guitarist at an unbelievably low price offers a wide selection, ranging from soloist with full orchestra to acoustic from the artist's career. The dexterity and control of Narciso Yepes's mastery at the 10 string guitar is almost beyond comprehension."
5,AMAZING,You wont be let down. A CD that you can listen to from start to finish over and over again.Hot chicks dig it!
1,Pre-Algebra: Math Blastger Mystery (Jewel Case),I was disappointed in the product. It didn't seem to have as much to do with actual algebra as it proclaims. It is geared to a much younger group of children than 12-14 year olds.
1,Lousy and will not install,Probably more disappointed in this product and especially Amazon. I should have known when the outside of the packaging trumpets that it supports Windows 3.1 and Windows 95! It wouldn't even install on my computer running XP. Of course instructions from Davidson had no 800# for service. I really should have read more reviews. I just didn't think that someone would ship me a software product at least 8 years old.
5,Great introduction,"A great introduction to the topic. Easy to read, very well informed. It was published over ten years ago, so it doesn't contain the most up-to-date thought on the topic, but really lays the groundwork."
4,Incomplete collection,"Why on earth would the record company choose to include ""Congo"" (post-Phil Collins), while excluding ""Man On The Corner"" or ""No Reply At All?"" ""Congo"" was far from a hit."
2,"Good for a while, workmanship is poor","Well they were good for a while. The sound was decent, a little lacking on the bass, but decent for the price.After having them for a few months, things started going wrong.The sound cuts in and out. The volume control on the line to the headphones is defective; I suppose that is why they are discontinuing this model.If the volume control taps something likely it will throw off the sounds, it will either muffle it or turn the headphones into a mono set, if you tap the volume control just right you may be able to fix it for at least a little while.The volume wheel is also defective, it will distort the sound if moved... defeating its purpose.(This was all with light, gentle use)If you want a decent pair of headphones for a few months, and you can be gentle with them give these a chance, otherwise stay away from these defective headphones."
5,BEST WINE BOTTLE OPENER EVER!!!,"My wife and I are huge wine drinkers. We have tried many different styles of wine bottle openers, but none compare to this one. It takes less than 10 seconds to open the bottle. Yes, it is costly, but after opening as many bottles as we have over the many months, it is definitely worth the price. Great quality and easy to use."
1,DO NOT Buy This!!!,"Save yourself the trouble. Good news: The corkscrew is very slick so it slides easily into the cork. Bad news: The corkscrew is very slick so it slides easily OUT of the cork, leaving the cork itself undisturbed in the neck of the bottle. Waste of money."
3,Really makes you work for it.,"I like the idea of an eyeliner that applies like the tip of a pen. It's familiar to hold, easy to control, and can go from thick to thin. BUT, I have to press the tip against a smooth surface (I use a little mirror) until the makeup bleeds out so I can soak it back up and apply in an even line. I essentially use it more like a paintbrush, which works, but it's less convenient. I have to say, though, it does have staying power and isn't as harsh as some eyeliners can be."
4,Good eyeliner for the price,"DOES last 24 hours, but it drys out somewhat fast, which is to be expected from a drug store liquid eyeliner pen. Defiantly recommend to anyone practicing liquid eyeliner, appliance is very easy."
1,Painful!,"In order to draw a line on my lid with this pen, I had to press really hard, which in turn made my eyes hurt and water, and ruined the eyeliner. It was really hard to get a solid line out of it, it seemed like from the first use it was running out of liquid. I tried another Styli-Style product with similar results, and will never purchase this product again. Save your money, anything this company makes is a huge disapointment!"
3,Amazing staying power but not brown,"I am impressed by the staying power of this eyeliner. It stays on really, really well. However it is just not brown. The color of the one I received is black with a greenish tint even though the pen says ""Brown 504"" on it."
1,Disappointing!,This goes on very weakly and dried up within days! So disappointed after reading many good reviews about this product.
1,Colored waterproof liners bleed everywhere.,"I had originally liked the waterproof black liner but had problems getting the liquid all the way to the tip, as others had mentioned. Since I was ok with the black, I decided to try the blue and turquoise. They went on easily and smoothly. However after a couple of hours it had bled into my crease and upper lid and when my eyes watered, it bled everywhere and ran right INTO my eyes making my eyes entirely blue, which was scary and had to be rinsed out. (I hope it's safe.) I've never seen a waterproof liner that ran so easily. Even non-waterproof liners are more color-fast than this. The colored ones I tried are all going back. Try it yourself. Put some on your hand, wait for it to dry, then apply some water and watch the blue smear all over. The colored versions are BAD, BAD PRODUCTS."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I'm so sorry I bought this eyeliner! It doesn't work at all. I can draw with it on my hand but when I try to use it on my eyelid, nada. I don't know if it is because of the angle of holding it or why the liquid won't come out, but it was a total waste of money!!!"
2,Not impressed,Had this set for about 4 months of daily pc gaming use. Only put them on and taken them off and laid on desk at night and microphone would work sporadically after the first 6 weeks due to the poor construction of the in-line volume controls. I would have to twist and fool with the wires to get it to work. AT times it was impossible until I tried the next day. I'm an electronics enginner so I took apart the in-line controls and checked the construction and the wires are microscopic that connect to a tiny I mean real tiny pc board. This is where they fray and lose contact. watch out for these because in time the solder contact where the mic is attached on this board will come off the board completely rendering them useless unless you want just headphones. Steer clear and look somewhere else.
3,Microphone is terrible,"I bought this set at Best Buy as well. I'm returning it today. The microphone is horrible on both my laptop and PC. The headphone portion works great, but is a little uncomfortable after 20 or so minutes (I've got a big head)."
2,Very Uncomfortable,"It should be noted that these are Supra-Aural, so they press on the ears. Also, they are not a very good Closed system; I can still hear my cat walking around the room when I have them on. The sound quality from these headphones is good considering the price, but they are very uncomfortable after a short period of time. After 15 minutes my ears were very hot, and after 30 minutes the pressure on my ears made me switch back to my earbuds."
3,Too small,Nice bucket but it's too small. Should have given how many qts it held. For $38 it won't hold enough ice for over 4 people and a couple drinks. I needed something for parties. I am returning.
5,"Un-Sung Legend released ""One Heart, One Love""","A legend on ""smooth jazz"" radio stations, Phil Perry has always lent his one-of-a-kind voice to instrumentalists, to their benefit. With ""One Heart, One Love"", he finally did it for himself. In my humble opinion, only Phil and Patti LaBelle have a range that has be un-defiable. His first single on the CD, ""I'm sorry"", is a testament to that. When the lyric conveys that he is crying, his phrasing reflects that, without loosing the power of the note. In other words, the emotion is not forced or faked. And, ""Do What Comes Naturally"" is a DJ/ReMixer's dream. With the right track, and vocal dubbings, it could become a House anthem. I like the whole product, because I listen to the entire CD in one sitting. You will most likely not tend to jump around on the tracks, unless your player set up to do so. You will wrap yourself in this CD. Enjoy."
1,a good singer wack material,i think Phil perry has a good voice.but this generic material does him no justice.the Al Green Medley is very Weak& Sad.Wine Cooler R-N-B.very boring.
3,Haven't used it yet...,I haven't actually used this thing yet (that's why only 3 stars) but it seems to be of very good quality. I purchased this as a hurricane survival item and to use it while camping in the summertime. I will report back when I have real world experience.
3,Just a Little Disappointed,"I agree with the other reviewers that this game is a lot of fun but there is only one small box of cards (1/2 adult and 1/2 child questions). My daughter and I played 2 games and had already gone through the cards. Even though we didn't get the same questions most of the time it was still disappointing. I called Hasbro and they have no plans of making additional cards for this game, which is really too bad. Does anyone else remember when Trivial Pursuit had 2 huge boxes of questions and the other question boxes that you could purchase?Aaaaah memories!"
4,fun,this game is very fun and educaional at the same time. You can learn alot about about disney. My family and I have a ton of fun playing this.
5,Great for family!,"Our family of 4 loves this game. its a fun game for everyone. although, we are really disappointed that we cant get more questions, or even a newer addition with the newer movies included. overall we have lots of fun with this game."
5,Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Zelda has changed my life I have all the T-shirts the audio cd I have every Zelda game ever made like for gameboy ""Links Awakening"" I have the N64 Zelda game etc... I have the Zelda watch and pocket watch I have all the Zelda toys I've seen all the Zelda cartoons and now finally the book the conclusion is that Zelda RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,More Zelda Stuff for Zelda freaks!,"Zelda has gone multimedia! From Game, to Audio CD, to TV cartoon, and now in writing. This book answers many questions about the game's storyline and has trivia and facts that many hardcore zelda fan will love."
1,Another succesful screw-up by wannabe Jason R. Rich!!!,"Jason did it again! Taking a great game and trying to confine it to a 120 page book doesn't work! Since when did a guy who writes job hunting tips write video game novelizations! The book has no thinking in it. It is very flat and boring! No emotion! My Prima Strategy Guide is bursting with info, and the authors actually care about content! They have larger imaginations! They don't use video games and books to make cheap cash like Jason, and sadly even Nintendo sometimes...P.S. Jason, stick with the self-helps and the biographies!P.S.S. Jason don't write your own reviews! And readers enter reviews in only once!P.S.S.S. I am not employed by Prima! I am just a video game fanatic that likes whooping Al's butt with whatever weapons I can get my greedy hands on, like Game Sharks and guides!"
2,Could have been way better. What is it supposed to be?,"This book is the worst video-game based novel I have ever read. The autor limits himself to describing the onscreen action, never going any deeper in the story. He even fails to highlight some potentially dramatic events, such as the first encounter with a Boss. Most key puzzles are overlooked, especially near the end where help is the most crucial. My advice is to play the game and to buy the official Nintendo Power Strategy Guide."
3,Zelda Book Review,"All in all this book was O.K., but not for $50!!! I have been playing Zelda games since I was in Kindergarten, and this was below the standard I was used to. For a cheaper read, just read the strategy guide, because it's actually longer than the book! I would recomend this book to a younger age of kids unable to complete this game. But if you've played it once, the book is very boring. If you really want to experiance the Ocarina of Time, actually play the game!"
3,Meh,"As a Legend of Zelda fan, I had to have this - I thought it would be a good story of Ocarina of Time, but it's literally like a walkthrough of the game in a somewhat novelization form. If you're looking for a STORY - read the manga - this is not what you would be expecting. But, I had to have it! ;)"
5,Electronic Wizardry,"I am giddy about my new toy. This thing is small and light and comes wrapped in a quality leather case. I didn't bother with the iRiver earbuds... went right for my Sony Nudes and it sounds terrific, especially with the SRS WOW (not for purists). Downloads are quick. No software needed after you install the UMS driver... just drag and drop. Battery life is very generous.My wife thought I was throwing away cash on an overly expensive piece of gadgetry... but when she held it for the first time, the luddite was impressed. When I'm home, I plug it into the home stereo. On the road, I use it with the iRock 400 FM transmitter.I have pretty varied taste in music... Miles, Marley, Matthews and Mozart... It's great to be able to have ALL of my favorite music with me all of the time."
2,FIRMWARE UPDATE IS A LIE,"Product is fine. But iriver's claim for ""firmware update"" is a total joke. They advertise one thing, but then ignores its customers after they have purchased it. Look up the firmware for this product at iriver.com. The last update was January of 2004. The company promised another update by June, and still no word. Chances are, the January 2004 update will be the last for this product. That means you'll NEVER have on-the-fly playlist, unlike the Ipod. Nor can you delete files from the player itself. Avoid this company. It won't last."
2,Beware Long-term Durability,"iRiver is known for poor quality. Buttons break frequently. You will be happy for one year(sound quality is good) but, then the device will break. iRiver does NOT stand behind their product. They, apparently, depend upon breakage to generate new sales. Additionally, they sell at higher prices than their competitors - and give lower quality.Look at Consumer Reports November 2004 issue. It will be clear to you which products you should be considering."
2,I'm about to return it for the second time,"First time I purchased the item was because the battery only lasted 6 hours. Also the Wav. files took up to much space.Second time around, battery life a littel better but the player can't read wma. files. I'm not really feeling this product because it's not living up to the good reviews that I read. I'm disappointed because I really want to like the player, but it's not working out for me"
5,"a very dependable, high-quality mp3 player","I haven't had a hitch with this mp3 player. Where you hear about various bugs with almost every other mp3 player, I've gone 2 months without running into a single problem. I'm somewhat of an audiophile, and the sound quality is very impressive for such a small machine. Plus, unlike most other high-end mp3 players, this can play un-protected songs, like songs you download off of kazaa or other P2P programs. So if you get most of your music through P2P, then this is a MUST-HAVE."
5,Awesome!!!,"This product is so great!!Actually,I used a sony ms70d(small mp3 player),but as u know,this stuff is so much uncomfortable.(I have to convert all of my mp3 files to artac3 files...it takes so much time)Anyway,I really like this stuff. Everything is so perfect.Personally, I hate ipod.(short battery life,not supporting radio,etc...)If you get this,you'll really like this."
5,Fantastic!,"The 20GB iriver is perfect. I would not change a thing. This is my second iriver, but my first hard drive type player. I had their 128MB flash player (which was so great that I decided to upgrade). Battery life on the ihp-120 is about 14-15 hours if you're changing folders, turning on the backlight, turning it off and on..etc. I really like the large screen and the ease of scanning through your music selection. The sound is the best part of the iriver. The other brands do not have the same high quality sound...they seem more focused on providing silly features and more memory, but they forget what the purpose of the mp3 player is...to play music. Iriver gives you all the accessories instead of the ipod where you have to buy the remote and all the different headphone attachments. Not a bit of buyers regret!"
4,Could be better.,this is a reasonably good mp3 player. the only things i didnt really like about it were the facts that u couldnt make a playlist right on the mp3 player. The sound quality is great and i f you get yourself a really good pair of headphones(i can't use earbuds anyways so the horrible quality of the provided ones weremnt a huge deal to me.) its wicked loud. Its got a great fm radio. Me i personally like its looks over the ipod but whatever floats your boat. Another thing i didnt like was the remote. When i bought this i heard great things about the remote but its very flimsy and is much harder to get used to that the actual unit. Plus the earphone hole thingie is in a really weird place and at times the music can only be heard in one ear. thats on the remote. All in all its a good Mp3 if all u really care about is the music. Its most definitely worth it.
5,I CANT PUT IT DOWN,"I am so impressed with this product... Thanks to the other people for leaving good reviews on this product because that was what primarily got me to buy this. I can't describe the feeling you get when you open the package. You know when you hold something and you can just tell it's not cheap? Thats how I feel. The features are great, I love having a radio and a voice recorder. I spent the entire night last night putting music on it; and no that's not because it's slow. It is simply drag and drop like a hard drive would be. I just had to pick out the good stuff :) 5 Stars ***** !"
4,Great. But needs some more basic features,"After doing extensive research for months and returning a zen xtra , I got this cute little thing. I am quite satisified with my new iriver it has solid construction, Sound quality is excellent, FM tuner and voice recorder work great.Areas where Iriver needs improvement are,User Interface - I cant say it's bad. But it's definitely not easy if you havent read the manual completely.Playlist - You cannot create a playlist on your iriver. you can play a m3u file which was created on a computer. with the iriver you can only play all the songs or songs in a single folder or a particular song. You cant select and play song A + song B + song C + etc or Folder X + Folder Y + Folder Z so on. I hope iriver will add this feature in their future firmware releases."
4,Go For It!,I was a bit disappointed when Santa showed up with the iRiver instead of the iPod. What a mistake! The sound quality and navigation are great. Battery life is superb. Remote is awesome. I'm having a ball with it. My only regret is that it doesn't have that sleek Apple design. But reliability counts for a whole lot more.
4,It's worth it.,"I have this jukebox for almost a month and I've been using it every day ever since. In my opinion, the overall performance is great! I'd recommend it to other people simply because it's not as pricey as ipod, great features, and it comes with built-in voice recorder that works great. I also find it easy to navigate with the joystick.Unfortunally the battery life for mine is more like 10 hrs (not 16 hours) and they could've came up with a better design for the earphones."
2,"Bought it, shoulda returned it","(1) Not loud enough - its like having a 12w boombox or something. I fly a lot - you will have to crank this to the max setting to even seriously hear it on a plane.(2) Sound not so great - its good, but not as good as others out there.Other than that, it is just awesome. For me though those are major items."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"If you plan to download music from the legal napster, this product is worthless. It implies from the description you can do it and after 6 hours of downloading updates and searching the internet you still can't do it. I called their customer support and they said ""who would want to download must and store it on the iriver player?"". I said, ""um, I think a lot of people"". And his reply, ""so now you represent the industry?"".The music industry wonders why they are in trouble!?"
1,It is going back now,"After 1.5 hours trying to get this up and running - it is going back to the store. I am not exactly computer illiterate but and this is the most frustrating product to get started. One problem was that the softward included with the product was too old (v 1.1 included - v 3.05 online). Online support is difficult to navigate and phone support is not available on the weekend. If it is this tough to get started, forget it. My time is too valuable. Hello iPOD."
4,Awesome,"I just got the iRiver iHP-120 and so far I love it. I'm coming from the Nike sport psa128 max, which is a miserable mp3 player. I chose the iRiver over an iPod because I'm a PC user and didn't want to take my chances with an iPod - plus the iRiver comes with the USB cable, which the iPod doesn't.It's been really easy to use my iRiver with my computer. It is recognized as an external hard drive and you just drag files into it. So simple! The sound quality is great and I have no problems navigating the buttons. The headphones are pretty bad, but a decent pair of headphones doesn't really cost much. I totally enjoy my iRiver and would definitely recommend it."
5,Above Expectations,"The iRiver iHP-120 is simply an awesome little MP3 player. It is a little overwhelming trying to get used to using it but other than that it's been outstanding. Every day for the first two weeks I've learned a little more and there isn't much it isn't capable of. I love it's simple computer hookups and the internal and external mics. I've used it for running, plane rides, transfering music files, recording guitar practices and intend on using it to record live music. A must for every music lover and certainly a peak into the future of music media."
1,Great product - but poor support!,"Great product. But the way the company lies is very frustrating, especially when you have to keep checking the website for the nonexistent promised firmware upgrade. It seems small and petty, but after owning the product for a while, trust me, you'll regret buying it."
3,Adds gaps between tracks,"I bought iRiver because it supports Ogg format. I use Ogg instead of MP3 because it is easier for engineers to provide gapless playback with Ogg. But iRiver iHP 120 firmware v17 inserts gaps between tracks, even for back-to-back Ogg tracks. Beethoven's 5th, Abbey Road, and Frampton Comes Alive just aren't the same. Firmware is upgradeable, so I will keep my fingers crossed for a fix."
2,short-lived,"I got my orange tabby Perfect Petzz cat about 6 months ago. It has not been dropped or handled roughly. After 5 months, the cat stopped ""breathing."" I put brand new batteries in twice, tested the batteries to insure they were good, and it still does not work.It is a sweet cat and has generated many comments sitting on my office desk. However, this product is short-lived."
2,My daughter thought it did more than just sleep,My daughter had wanted this for her birthday and received it from a relative. She was thrilled until she realized that it did not move. It is in a sleeping position and it's chest rises and falls to look realistic. It does come with a brush. I guess she assumed it moved or could be posed into a standing position. A stuffed animal would have been cheaper.
3,Very Sleepy Puppy,"I bought this for my dog-loving son for his 3rd birthday. He absolutely LOVES that it ""breathes"" but he isn't crazy about the fact that the dog ""sleeps"" all the time. He keeps trying to pry its eyes open. Hands down this dog looks more realistic than other animals and the carrying case option is great. But it also does far less than other toy dogs and cats like Fur Real. The batteries supposedly last forever which is nice, but I'm not sure this was the best option for a gift. I should have listened to the reviews."
1,Overpriced Toy,"The item never quite worked correctly, very little breathing action for a little bit then nothing.Luckily the manufacturer accepted my $5 for a replacement."
1,"NOT REALLY A TOY, DOES NOTHING","I bought this dog for my daughter, thinking she could ""play"" with it. It does nothing but breathe, and you can't turn it off. It also looks strange when it breathes. It is also really hard, and not cuddly. The fur is not soft and smells musty. My child was bored with this immediately. I do not recommend it as a toy for children, it may be good for an older person looking for an animal substitute."
4,Etherial Beauty,"Those who are familiar with the Byzantine choral tradition of the Greek Orthodox Church and its polyphonous offspring in the Russian Church will be pleasantly surprised by the quite different sound of these Romanian choral works. Serene and gentle, they create an immediate atmosphere of reverence and mystery: a beautiful bridge tradition between the Orient and the West. The pieces do get somewhat repetitious and could have included some more dramatic interpretations as can be heard on historical recordings of the Tabor label, but since Romanian choral works are rarely heard in new recordings, this a must-buy for those interested in the spectrum of music from the Eastern Churches. Most of the pieces are sung in liturgical Romanian."
3,"Not somewhere to start, but somewhere to go.","Length:: 6:47 MinsWhile the movie itself follows the mythology of the Resident Evil storyline, I didn't feel as though it did a lot to contribute to the overall story that the franchise has followed. It's 'average' in regards to a movie, but what makes it fun to watch is the preestablished characters that the film follows. It has great CGI (though nothing amazing) and the film's finale is inventive, just like the Resident Evil games before it have been.I'd recommend it, but only to preexisting fans of Resident Evil. This isn't somewhere to start if you haven't played the Resident Evil games before."
2,Better than previous Resident Evil films but...,"The plot/story line is so thin and contrived as to be invisible. Also there is none of the tension that is found in the games or even in some of the scenes of the previous (poorly written/directed) films. The original game and its spinoffs have superior story lines and one wonders why the film makers don't follow them or, at least, use them as a foundation for their own plotlines and dialogues. Some of the characterizations are both silly and unbelievable. One really gets the feeling that the entire film was an ""Ad Lib"" effort with any planning or thought.The film could easily have been better."
2,Not Movie Material,"Well, I have been playing Resident Evil since the late 90's. And I have to say that this movie wasn't REALLY bad ...it just had a bad director. The plot was really lame for resident evil fans to appreciate it, and I really didn't care for those new characters that they brought into the movie. I rented this one, and I am glad I did.Now if you are a hardcore fan that collects, I would buy it and never open it, then when a decade pass see how much it is worth on eBay. LOL!I love Resident Evil but this one was.....not good."
1,Awful,The first anime was very good. This one was boring and totally sucked! Story was awful and the action scences were not all that. Good visuals but not done well at ll. Avoid buying this crap if you can.
2,Glorified Video Game,"Wouldn't really suggest this unless you are really into Resident Evil, and then just for the insight into the RE universe.The movie itself is quite cheesy with a video game style plot. The CG is about the same as what you would expect in a video game cutscene as well. Very little facial animation makes all the characters pretty dry and the voice acting leaves something to be desired as well.As stated before, just rent it, and only if you are a real RE fan."
3,rent it first,It's an ok movie but I wished it followed the game's search for clues/hunt for objects in the spooky building along with shoot and kick zombie butt.
2,Boooring,"A boring and predictable movie. (The CGI is pretty though)Don't waste your money on this one. It's hard to explain why this movie is so bad without spoiling it... If you must know, the movie declines after the initial airport scene which lasts only maybe 6 or 7 minutes. Through the rest of the movie you'll just be scratching your head wondering what is going on.Should you manage to actually watch this crap-fest the whole way through, you'll likely place it on a shelf (or preferably at the bottom of the ocean) to never watch again.Don't believe me? Well then... I'd like to see your review of the movie after you watch it."
5,Better than expectaction,"I watched this movie with very low expectation. After Final Fantasy: The Spirits within and Advent Children fail so bad, I'm not sure if any CG animation with real 'humane' characterization movie will satisfies me.It is safe to say that I was very wrong. Although for whoever that are thinking of getting this movie, should be aware that this serves mostly as fan service to those who plays the game.Don't get me wrong. I don't play the game (it's too hard for me), but I still enjoyed it thoroughly. The movie has plot, character development, and actions that's just fun to watch. If you're craving for more, you can also watch the special features, and you should pick up the previous story here and there. Still not satisfied? Wikipedia is your friend :)Oh yeah, if you decided to get this movie, don't miss the 'voice bloopers'. It's so funny I was laughing so hard. Trust me, you won't be disappointed."
2,Disappointing......,"I was very disappointed by this film. With the excellent storyline from the video games as the foundation, this film could have done so much. So many story elements from the games for the writers to choose from to expand upon. Origin/motivation of Wesker, Leon's government training after RE2, some backstory on the Redfields and on and on. A missed opportunity by Capcom."
3,awesome,The movie was great I felt like I was playing the game only no hard work.However I waited the max time allowed for this dealer deathsoljah.
3,what the HELL is wrong with leon's eyes?!?!?!?,"i will give this movie a 3 1/2 stars. the plot is ok, too much dialogue and secret conspiracies. however, i was totally...um shock you can say when i first saw Leon on the movie. i was like what the hell is wrong with his eyes!?!?! first i thought it was only that scene on the movie but it was through the whole movie. in my mind i was like this is no the Leon Kennedy that i remember from the games. it looked like Kennedy had down syndrome but i guess the producers wanted to give him a more asian look, which they did, but the look doesn't work for Leon. next time don't mess with his eyes!!!!!!"
3,Decent,"I've been a huge Resident Evil fan for sometime and after the atrocity that was the 3rd live action movie, I was hoping a CG venture would put things back on course. While this move was fun and enjoyable, the plot didn't feel like it was all there. Had it been fleshed out better and made care about the characters, I probably would've scored it higher. While playing out better than Advent Children did, it still has that same awkward feel. The movie was only 96 minutes long. Had they gone longer, I felt they could've done much more with the story and greatly improved the flow of the film."
3,Resident Evil: Degeneration,"Very good, and was dilevered very quickly. my bf and i really enjoyed this movie. it stared claire and leon(2 of my favorite charthers in the game)"
1,What a piece of Crap,Very average CGI. Story line way too soap oriented. One good creature and that was it. There's just no way you can do character and emotional development in this format so Just Say No.
1,Not happy,I was really disapointed when this arrived and i saw that it was a copy of resadent evil the movie and not resadent Evil degenaration.
1,Why not in English???,"Why is this movie being released in the USA with only English subtitles, I would buy it, if I could also have it dub in English instead of Japanese only.For this reason only I am given it 1 star. cause I haven't seen it yet."
5,Much better than the 3 live action movies combined,"This movie was 1000 times better than any of the lame live action RE movies. Ok, the first RE movie wasn't all that bed just ok. And the 3rd one? Come on, chasing zombies in the desert? It looked more like a Mad Max movie than a RE movie. Degeneration blows all 3 away!!! Everyone needs to buy it so they will see there is enough interest for a sequel.There REALLY needs to be a degeneration game for the PS3/360. I think the graphics and atmosphere look WAY better than RE5. So far the trailer for RE5 looks more like a mercenaries game than an RE game. Lets write CAPCOM and ask them to make a game from this movie as a side plot game.I give RE Degeneration 2 big thumbs way up."
3,Huh,Now considering the Trilogy of Resident Evil films that had Nothing to due with the game besides name. This is a more intouch version that stays very true to the Resident Evil universe.
3,Time user,"I'll be up-front - I don't know the game and I know the movies just a little bit... but I do watch animated movies, sci-fi, zombies, vampires, etc. Anyhow, even though this may not be too helpful, I'll just leave it at this - in my opinion, it looks like it's best to be a fan of RE to watch this one."
4,degeneration,the story wasn't very good but it was fun to watch. the look and movements of the humans could have been better but the environments and creatures looked great. as a fan of the games i enjoyed watching it and believe it was worth the price (19.99). It had a fair amount of extras if you like that sort of thing.
3,Help / A Question from Resident Evil 3,"As yet, I have not seen this CGI/Film, so would appreciate any help with the following. I've just read the reviews, and have a few questions.Can anyone help/tell me why Mila Jovovich is not in this ""film"", and does the story continue from Apocalypse ? She was last seen talking to the Umbrella bosses who were underneath Tokyo ?Basically, i thought the films 1-3 are excellent, as they tell the story , and the flashbacks that Alice has blend in perfectly with the plot. I have no interest in gaming, and have never played any of the Resident Evil games, but treat the films independently as ""films in their own right"".If this CGI #4 is not linked to apocalypse, does anyone connected with the makers/in the know, know if the plot from #3 will be carried on.Thanks for any help;Resident Evil: Degeneration"
3,Great movie but bad disc,The print of the disc and the back of the disc is very cheap and does not compare to most of the blu ray disc you buy. The good thing about the disc is it's compatible with all region.The movie was great a great it does justice to the resident evil franchise
1,Degeneration - perfect title,"As the title states, the movie ""degenerates"" into nothing more than boring dialouge, short action sequences, confusing story, and subpar computer animation.I am a Resident Evil fan; however, I found this movie extremely boring and poorly animated. The cinema scenes in the actual Resident Evil video games are more exciting than this movie."
1,Save Your Money!,"The title says it all. Don't waste your hard-earned money on this nonsense. My sons and I are big fans of the RE games. I was looking forward to seeing Leon & Claire in a story that was more than just cut-scenes. That being said, when the best thing on the DVD is the scripted ""gag/blooper reel,"" something is really wrong.I gave this one star simply because Amazon wouldn't let me give it no stars. The story is stupid, the characters are one-dimensional, and the CGI of some of the characters (the Senator, for one) is pathetic. Except for the bloopers, the bonus features are useless. The ""interview"" with Leon Kennedy was boring and insipid. I'll keep this review short by saying,if there were any way to get back the $20 I threw away on this mess."
2,"Truly, an awful movie.","I was really quite unpleasantly surprised by this movie. I figured, a video game based direct to DVD 3D animated movie, Okay. So I set the benchmark around Final Fantasy 7: Advent Children, in terms of animation, style, and overall action, sat back, and prepared for some intense story, and zombie killing action.What I got here was poorly written, animated, modeled, and directed mush that would barely pass as an in-game cutscene. The story was convoluted, the characters stiff and wooden (Leon's hair NEVER moves: In wind, water, explosions, NEVER!) and the whole long-winded affair offered only about 20 minutes of true action.I have enjoyed the RE franchise since it's beginning, and consider myself a true fan. That said, I cannot recommend this movie to anyone, save the collector who simply must have this small piece of the story told. It was truly appalling what this studio thought would pass for entertainment in the eye's of it's fans.Avoid this like the T-Virus!"
1,Exceptionally Disappointing,"Didn't the producers of this DVD ever see the Final Fantasy movie? Hair never moves in this until the very last scene. Leon's hair also doesn't move until then, but for the majority of this picture his hair is like a helmet.Nothing new here. The DVD just looks like an animation of a Resident Evil game, right down to a big Boss Battle that never seems to end.All in all, with its flat and lifeless animation coupled with a weak story, this is a VERY disappointing effort.We want Jill Valentine! ( The live version )."
4,Good movie,"I'm a RE fan since 96 with the Original for PS1, I do own all the games, although I don't really like the new direction the games are going now, so when I knew this movie would feature zombies I psyched, unfortunate the zombie scenes were very short, but the most important is this movie is very entertaining. I thought the animation where spot on and so the graphics, it deserved a 4.5, if we had at least another 20 minutes running from zombies at the airport I would've give 5 stars."
4,Enjoyable animated feature,"If you like the Resident Evil games, you'll like this I'd wager. It's well written with a good script and characters and good animation. It's much more like the games than it is like the live-action movies and it's a fairly complete story as a stand alone.Lots of death and adult themes, but you probably expect that.Fun characters (completely vile politician is fun to root against)...helps if you already know the story though.Good bridge between the games. I enjoyed it."
4,"Good, not great, but highly entertaining","Resident Evil: Degeneration is my favorite RE movie mainly because the story is really good. While the montion-capture animation of characters' mouths is ""off,"" and the dialogue is stilted in places, the characters are interesting and believable. I like this much better than the overblown live-action RE films, and it's nice to see Leon S. Kennedy get screen time beyond the video games."
5,Best Set; Good Price...,"This is a really nice set at a good price. It features all DG's Berg recordings--which really are about the best around. This ""Collectors' Edition"" is certain to disappear soon and increase in value."
2,Hard to get on/cheap material,I bought this when I broke my tib/fib and needed a good cast cover to last a long time. This seemed initially like a good one. It was extremely hard to get on. It was water-tight until a huge hole ripped on the back-side. I attribute this to the difficulty getting it on...pulling and tugging. This all happened within two weeks. Save your money and buy a cheaper model. It will probably last a lot longer.
5,solves a difficult problem,"My doctor recommended that I buy this product for use after a difficult foot surgery. I have had a number of foot surgeries before, and remember very well the constant anxiety of trying to keep a cast dry through many long weeks of recovery--the plastic bags that slip, etc. This cast cover is heavy duty latex; it has a shoe with a heavy sole on the bottom for stability; and it absolutely seals the water OUT. Pretty pricey, but then again it's really hard to make do with sponge baths done from the sink for two months, so in my opinion, well worth it. The Amazon seller shipped immediately; the product reached me within a week."
3,not as good as the old style xerosox,better than most cast covers on the market. they are now made of a thinner rubber and more prone to tearing while trying to get them over the cast. the older model was thicker and would not tear as easily.
5,So worth the money!!!!,"Taking baths/showers with a cast is much more pleasant with this product. I have a short leg cast to just below the knee for a broken foot. At first I purchased one of the bag type covers with a gasket at the top. It worked for a bath with my foot out of the water, but if I pushed on the top ring the gasket was no longer sealed against the leg (water could enter). Afterwards I purchased this Drycorp waterproof cast cover. It works so much better!! You slip this over the cast and then pump the air out with the rubber bulb. My leg stayed vacuum-packed and allowed me to shower/bathe without any worries. I recommend using a sock, pillowcase, or wrap to cover the cast before putting the Drycorp waterproof cover on so the rough cast doesn't rip or put a hole in it. Seriously it is worth the money. I bought the large size for me and I also bought a size small for my three year old nephew (short leg cast). His has worked fantastic for him as well. No leaks!"
1,Did not fit over my cast,"I'm 5'10 200 lbs. have a half cast, I do have bigger than average leg muscles. This device looks nice but it was impossible to get over even my heal, my wife and I struggled with no success, 13 in. and up, not a correct statement."
1,It never fits right,"We bought the boot after contacting the company regarding the right size to get for a cast that was below the knee. We ordered the boot and it arrived right away - good service!. When we tried to get the boot on, it was a joke. It's designed that the top of the boot is much smaller than the remainder and has hard has we pulled we could not get it over the cast. The larger size would have been way to big and this design doesn't make sense.We finally ended up cutting the boot at the top and sliding over the cast - using duck tape to seal it. It worked but was not the origginal plan.We called the company about alternatives but were nreally not given any. With the duck tape it worked fine, but that was not the way it was supposed to work."
2,Buyer Beware!,"At first, i loved the idea of this thing, so I ordered it. Upon using it, i noticed that the rubber had the smell of a regular baloon, but rubber being what it is, i said ""whatever"". I loved the fact that the valve only pulls air out. Gave wonderful protection in the bathtub. However, after the third time using it trying to get the tight neck of the baloon near my knee, the top of the thing becomes rolled down, and sticks to itself. Im 6'3'', and 290lbs. Moments ago, trying to properly fit the thing near my knee, it tore a straight line from the top almost to the valve. Needless to say, im quite disappointed with this. The consistency of the rubber always seemed suspect to me, but i also know it's not for everyday wear. This design has a number of flaws, mainly the rubber."
3,"Great idea, doesn't fit over splint","I ordered this the day of my surgery and when it came I was very excited to try it out. I could not get it over the very large ankle joint on my splint, so I figured it would still work when I got my regular cast on in two weeks. Meanwhile I was using a Curad product that only works in the shower, but stretched over my ankle no problem at all. It doesn't have the seal that this product has, but it was fine and easy for showering.Instead of a new cast after two weeks, my doctor put me in a fracture boot that I can take off for showering. So as much as the concept sounds great, this product ended up being impossible to try out due to not fitting. It is also non-returnable, so beware of that too!"
1,nice idea but Failed,"Thought this would help a lot while wearing the cast, but it tore the first time it was put on. Regretted the purchase."
5,Worth the Money,"Broke my ankle, I teach swimming, lifeguarding, and Water Aerobics. This product allowed me to keep a part of my life that makes me happy. The only time I felt free from the burden of crutches. It lasted through the cast stage and I stored it for any future breaks by friends or relatives. Great product. Just remember to put it below the bend of the knee, because when you bend you knee, and you place it above the knee it will break the seal and flood the cast. Oops, you'll spend all day with a dryer. Did that ONCE, learned my lesson, put it right above the cast."
5,Great Album,"This is the first Taj disc I was exposed to. It is very well done including a cover of James Brown (Think), along with some original compositions. Basically there is good reason Taj has won several grammys of late, and if you get into his music you'll immediately understand. The title track and 21rst Century Gypsy Singin' Lover Man stand out on this set. Queen Bee is also a great song that opens the set, and my wife likes very well. Warning, once you discover this artist, you will find yourself digging deeper and deeper craving more. Not the worst thing that could happen to you, Check it Out!!"
5,This is WORLD CLASS MUSIC!,"This is an amazing, original, varied, heart grabbing, booty shaking, head bobbing CD. This is the disc that could turn any music fan onto Taj. It comes through on the promise of Blues, Rock, World Music, and just plain human-Being expression. It has it all and in spades. Taj puts his whole soul into every song and performance. You can't ask for more."
1,Too many errors,"I would like to be able to give this book four or five stars, but the abundance of errors makes that impossible. Having bought the book in preparation for the Praxis PPST, I was looking forward to using the practice tests to identify areas I on which might need to brush up. Unfortunately, the errors made an accurate assessment close to impossible."
4,Great idea,"Unless you have a 3lb baby, it's hard to swaddle a wriggly newborn in the average receiving blanket as they're just too small. As an alternative to a larger, heavy blanket which might be overkill in anything but the coldest weather, these are soft, warm and fasten easily with two velcro tabs. I took one to the hospital with me when I delivered and the nurses loved it. However, they are a bit big for babies under about 8lbs, and the velcro tags don't attach very well to the surface of the blanket if you need to pull it tighter past the fastening patch. My 3 week old, who doesn't like being swaddled, can kick her way out of the pocket within a few seconds so they're not foolproof, but for a baby who does like being wrapped these would be a must-have."
1,not good enough,"I didn't really like the color for my daughter, but I liked the idea of it. But it was too big for her at first, when I really needed it and it was too small for her by the time I tried again (a couple months later). The velcro doesn't hold, when they kick it kicks off in 3 kicks. Don't bother!I am going to try the Cozy Cacoon, the Woombie, the Cocooi and (maybe) the SwaddleMe (it seems similar to this wrap though). I am also getting a Moby Wrap."
5,Good book :),"I'm not sure that is accurate about needing $10,000 to open a brokerage account with Schwab. Maybe in the past, but I was inspired to open one after reading this book and I had no problem doing so, and did not see mention of a minimum start anywhere...I did see that no load mutual funds that are performing well are being offered at minimums of only $100(!)I had no idea you could even begin investing for such a small amount...which might say something about my investment knowledge prior to this book, but I am glad I am reading this and getting started. I am definatley picking up some valuable insights out of this book."
1,Ugh.,I'm relatively stunned at the amount of good publicity this book seems to be getting in the media. I thought it was an incoherent rant that touched on many different subjects without order or insight. You might want to save your money on this one.
3,Not the best of the powder mixes,"Over the last couple of months I've been trying several different brands and flavors of the individual powder beverage mixes. Of all of them this one I liked the least. Besides the flavor being weird to the point of yuk, they tried for Citrus but got something almost, kinda sorta, but not quite like Citrus and landed right next to gag on YUK.All of the 4 different Lipton flavored beverage mixes that I tried do not mix well. After you empty it in the bottle of water you can shake it till your dizzy and your arms are tired and it will still have gobs in the bottom that didn't dissolve. When I finish using up what I have I WONT be waisting my money on any more of it."
2,Not the same flavor as the bottled product,"I was quite happy to see that Lipton offered a drink-stick with their wonderful Diet Green Tea w/ Citrus flavor - so I bought a big box of them. Boy, was I disappointed. The taste is not altogether terrible - BUT it is nothing like the bottled product which I really enjoy. It has a sweet sipid citrus taste - with no ""tea"" flavor at all. More like a light sugar free kids drink."
1,New and Improved means Awful -- beware ASPARTAME!!!,"Recently Lipton changed all their Iced Tea To Go flavors from sucralose sweetening to aspartame. They still taste fine, but the ""new and improved"" versions give me a blood sugar spike that makes me tremble.Bummer.I switched to Kroger's brand of the same stuff,... it is still sweetened with other-than-aspartame sweeteners. It doesn't taste quite as good as the Lipton used to, but at least I don't feel like I am coming apart after I drink it."
5,Delicious!,"I love these things, they are $1.87 here at my local wal-mart, unfortunately I just grabbed the last box, I might try the other flavors later."
5,Cirque is the Best,You need to see it to believe and appreciate it. Nice to see how they got to where they needed to be in order to achieve the awesomeness of Varekai. It makes you appreciate Varekai much more.
4,Pleased with this product,"I bought this for my son and he likes it very much great book, he finds it has alot of information in it."
3,A lot of essays on paintball,"I was looking more for who, what, when, where and how, but this is more of a biographical history of paintball told through several essays on the subject. It is informative, but NOT my go to definitive guide to paintball. It seems more like a series of magazine articles, than an actual book."
4,"the complete guide to paintball,third edition","This book is great for paintball fans.It has many new features like guns,gear,and games.Plus it gives you advice and hints so you can play like a pro.It has lots of great pictures and scenes.They play speedball and woodsball."
4,Good book,I have read the book and I think it is a book that it is vorth the price. Perhaps not for a professional player but for a starter/novice player will give good information. (...)
3,HONEST AND TRUE REVIEW,"first i bought this ...about a week [ago]. i'll go though the book to help you deside, what the book contants: 1 history 2 durty games 3 newbie mistakes 4 technology how gun work 5 maintenance shocker 6 choosing barrels 7 maintenance regulator 8 cleaning tippmann 98 9 safety 10 equipment 11 drills 12 tactics 13 pening moves 14 basics 15 guide to cover 16 taking and defending and moreits an excellent buy, could have more pictures but theres alway s one on each page, if the price was right like it is now i would give it 10/10"
5,A Good Buy,"Paintball is a great sport to get into, but it can seem intimidating at first to hear people talk about bunkering, angling, expansion chambers and venturi bolts. This book explains it all and gives even folks who have been playing awhile some great ideas for strategies and practices. If you're interested in paintball, this book is definately worth the money."
3,Outdated,THis is a good book for noobs but thats realy it. Its so old it includes the first few shockers. Not even WDP from 04.
5,The Complete Guide to Paintball,I have read this book and it is great. The tactic can really help and they teach you how to get the best of the other team. The book show you how to clean your weapon. It gives you important facts about hideing and shooting. This book is just perfect for the beginner.
5,The Complete Guide To Paibntball,I just wanted to let u paintball players out there this is a must have book and the u need to get it if u play paintball
5,Great Paintball Book!,I bought this book about a year after I started playing. I learned a lot. It is geared toward to newbie. It has pictures of guns and goes over how to clean and maintain them. It also has tactis. If you're starting out and want some good ideas then this is the book for you.
2,Las Hermanas Aguero,"The book seems to be good, but the translation is poor, and it is full of spelling errors - I only wished I had read the book in original language to really enjoy it! Between the translation and the spelling errors, it is very hard to read!! It is not a relaxing exercise any more. Pity!"
3,Too little dialogue,"There are touches of fun in this book, but too much indirect description. Certainly the clothes were over-described.I expected something more in the way of a typical regency, where the dialogue advances the plot. More direct speech needed!"
4,Helpful for artists,"If you're interested in altars from a magickal or artistic viewpoint, this is a good how-to book filled with prompts to get you building your own altar. It's mostly text, but if you're new to altars and not offended by Pagan themes, you'll enjoy this information. Combine this with the more illustrated book, ""In a Spiritual Style"" by Cerwinske, and you're set to create magnificent art and altars to the themes, images, deity, or deities of your choice."
3,Little Book of Alter Magic,"Normally I like D.J. Conway and once she got away from Llewellyn Publications, her books over all picked up in caliber.I found this book to be rather trite. Sure it has lots of correspondances in it, but that's about the only thing it offered and with having so many other books that also have correspondances in them, I saw no need to keep this book.This just isn't a book I'd recommend unless you really want to pick up everything D.J. Conway has published."
5,A REAL WINNER!,"I am actually shopping for one more of these beauties to give to the person I originally bought it for. I grab for this one before I reach for my Sony Vaio (believe it, or not) since I find it totally user friendly and I love that I can, with the built in software and the BUILT IN DVD RECORDER and CD-Rom burner, make disks for everything I need. The Sony only has a CD-Rom burner, so I have to have a separate DVD Recorder to transfer videos. Anyway, I bought the Sony first, and the Averatec for one of my employees, and here I am, clinging to the Averatec!"
3,Good but...,"Pros:- DVD Burner included- Long Battery Life- Big monitor screen- Lots of expansion ports (3 USB, 2 PCMCIA, 1 Firewire)- Wi-Fi included- The size, the 5110p is very thin.Cons:- The speakers are by far the worst...- The monitor screen its very weak. I used my 5110p for a couple months and after that a cyan line appeared accross the screen. The problem is not that bad since the line disappears when I push the edges a little, but I'm guessing that in the near future it could get worse.- The paint is also a problem. My 5110p is already full of scratches.Summary:Most of the time I'm happy with my 5110p. I think that, for what I paid ($1,050) it was a good deal, but be aware of the cons I mentioned above."
4,"Great sculpt, not the best action figure","This is a great looking toy with a nice paint job, good detailing and a nice rubber cape. There aren't a great number of points of articulation, though. The knees and elbows don't even bend, and the arms and legs only swing to and fro. This toy's strength is that it remains true to how the character originally appeared in the Kingdom Come comic. Unless you're wedded to the idea of getting a Kingdom Come toy, I wouldn't recommend this. There are better action figures out there to play with."
4,Investor Relations 101,"I provide communication support for a large company. Even though my role is largely internal communications, with some media relations support, I interface with a lot of other groups, including investor relations. This book was a nice intro to the subject (goals and strategies) of investor relations. It's a small book with lots of specific examples based on cheesy, fictional companies. I found it informative. Not, I suspect, a book for some with any significant background in the field."
2,Not The Vietnamese You Were Looking For,"I grew up in a multi-ethnic house, eating authentic Vietnamese food at least 5 days a week. I was very excited to find an illustrated cookbook that listed the dishes I wanted to cook, particularly since my mom and my favorite Vietnamese restaurant are both several hours away.I have to say, I was heartily disappointed with this cookbook. The recipes are close to what I know they SHOULD be, but something in them seems slightly off. I have a feeling that something was lost in the translation. This might be a good cookbook for those who already know what they're doing in the kitchen and just need inspiration, but it's definitely not for a new cook or someone new to Vietnamese cuisine.Your best bet with this book would be to look at the pictures and be creative. If you follow the recipes, you're likely to find disappointment."
1,The best of Yanni is sad indeed.,"While I've never been a fan of new age music, I do enjoy instrumentals. However,this album was a great disappointment to me. As his name illustrates, the dull and obnoxious stereotype of Yanni is accurate."
1,"Don,t waste your money","If you like to hear the same twelve bars of music played over and over, then buy this or any Yanni recording. It's amazing that people with no musical talent can succeed through the power of marketing. Prior to a Yanni concert, there usually is music of Mozart playing on the PA system. I guess this is because he thinks he is on some type of parallel to him. The truth is, he wouldn't even be qualified to be a page turner for Mozart."
4,Yeah Yanni,"I was very impressed by this CD. I have been a Yanni fan ever since I saw ""Live at the Acropolis"" in 1994. This is real music. Music that you feel in your soul."
2,Not Good,"I usually like yanni's music.But this was a disappointment. I only liked 2 songs on it.Come on Yanni,you're a great artist.You can do better."
3,Good music and variety; The included CD is a total waste,The arrangements are fine; its nice to see celtic without the need to re-tune. The included CD is merely a midi version of the tunes and isn't indicative of the music transcribed. Other midi instruments are added for effect. I would rather have a solo guitar than this lifeless midi mess.
3,Good general book to learn about grafologia,El libro lo compre para un regalo pero parece ser suficiente bueno para aprender un poco de grafologia general. Es pequeno y no tiene ninguna ilustracion en colores y la calidad del papel no es de las mejores pero al final del dia es solo un libro que es para leerlo.
1,AUUUUGGGGGGGG!,This mask is so awesome it deflected a nerf bullet!! then i went airsofting to show off my cool mask and someone with an automatic gun broke my mask!!(it was really strong 200 fps) then a bullet shot through and hit my eye i couldnt see for 5 mins!!!!my poor mask died...LOL JK THIS MASK COULDN'T STOP A FLY
1,You can die,My buddy died wearing this mask. Well he didn't die but he lost his eye. The mask got hit in the mesh and broke and all in his eye.
1,The Worse Air soft mask on the market,"I live in Peru South America, we buy 25 of this BB probe full face mask, they are no more than garbage many persons have been injury for use this masks, they broke so easily, with just 200fps .20g bbs, you will have your face cut by the fragments of the mask if I were in the united states I will try to demand those idiots for sale this dangerous mask to the people."
1,Notice the upper left corner?,"Thi is HotImportToys at their finest. They are advertising this as a bullet(bb) proof mask for use in airsoft. That leads me to question why in the upper left corner it says ""Not suitable for children under 3 years."" Now, why would it say that? This mask is meant to be a toy, yet H.I.T is saying this will stop bb's. Don't they realize that by misleading people like this those people could be seriously injured, or even killed??? I think this really needs to be looked at by Amazon. This could seriously kill someone."
3,Airsoft mask,"This item seems to be cheaply made. I bought it for a gift and had to open it to fix one of the snaps before wrapping, because it was broke in the package."
1,Stale Marriage? Remedy it with an affair!,"I wish I could convey all the sarcasm that I feel in the title of my review of this book. Because, bottom line, that is the message: In a middle-age married rut? Take a lover and watch the spice come back into your marriage! I don't recommend this novel on any level whatsoever. It was offensive and insulting, not to mention degrades and cheapens something that should not be. I wish I had passed on this one."
1,read it - hated it,all this book is about: Being bored with your marriage the moms goes to a retreat for a week - both have an affair - the kids keeping the dads affair secret and not wanting mom to come home they want the girlfriend cause shes fun. keep the affairs secret from each other forever and that makes the marriage happy again - NOTI had never read Carole Matthews book before and got it for a couple of bucks so the price was right I thought. well i over spent. I will not buy any more of her books. This was a horrible story and had parts i couldn't even read so I skimmed over chapters! Do I recommend this book to anyone? NO don't waist your time or money.I only gave it a one star because you can't give it minus stars!
3,Touchy Subject- Real Life Issues,"More to Life Than This deals with some real-world issues that couples face in the course of their marriages. I thought the book was very well written and dealt with thess issues in a unique way. While not my favorite Carole Matthews book, this is a good, light, fluffy read that is entertaining."
4,A GOOD BOOK,Nightmare is a good book. I gave it only 4 stars because since one horse got a highly contagious disease and no others did was pretty stupid. It was also silly of Carole to ride a really sick horse. What would have happened if she had run into another horse and rider? This was a good book but it wasn't very logical.
4,I thought this book was great.,"I love this book, but I got confused between this and other books. In this book, it says that Carole can stay in Lisa's brother's bedroom because he is at collage. But in the book Western Star on page 160 (the last sentance) Lisa says there are some advantages of being an only child. In the Starlight Christmas on page 13 at the top it says that Lisa bought a sweater for her brother. This is confusing. In the begining of most of the books it says she is an only child. What happened?"
4,A Great Book,This book is a wonderfully emotional book but it should be a little more Realistic. I mean when one of the saddle clubs favourite horse ops I'm telling to much. They dont'show the emotion that you would show in real life. But exepct for a little sad this is one of the best Saddle Club Books!
5,I LOVE this book!!,"This was one of of my favorite SC books of all time! I wasn't suprised to find Carole worrying over her Dad, but she got a little hysterical at times. This book was so good, I couldn't put it down for a second. I would recomend this book to anyone who loves horses, just be prepared!"
5,This book is great but very sad,Nightmare is a great book but VERY sad. I almost cried at the end- and I read it about 5 times. I like the part where Carol yells at Fiona. I also like when Stevie realizes who Mrs. Johnson is.
3,Nice for a fare day...,"Light weight and comfortable. I like that you can zip the arms off and turn it from a ""Windbreaker"" to a vest.I was expecting a Jacket not a Windbreaker.The description says, ""Jacket"". A little misleading.I would not suggest using this for extreme cold weather. Then again, how often is it really cold in Tampa..As far as the product goes, it's okay.I wouldn't have paid $60.00+ if I new it was going to be so light."
2,Can't expect much for the price,"It might be good for very light use, but within 3 months the chuck was bent on mine from hanging it on the side of a bucket (guess it banged against the side or something? Never dropped it or anything...first time this has happened on any of my tools). I really couldn't tell you much about it other than that...it hasn't worn out, but then again, I used it all of two times before I noticed the bent chuck."
2,You get what you pay for,"This drill is $10. It drills holes. In no way does it perform like an 18v cordless drill (nor perform like it looks). I used it to drill a 3"" hole in a sheet of 20ga steel and it drained the just charged battery, started to burn my hand and was smoking fairly good. That said- it's still working and I've used it several times since on the same project. I'd give it 3 stars but in comparison to my 14.4v craftsmen that I paid $35 for (got a $10 discount for signing up for a cc) and got 2 batteries, charger and drill, it's not as good a value at $30 for charger, drill and battery."
1,Breaks breaks breaks,I bought this watch in October of 2009. It is now May 2010. I have returned this watch 4 times all ready because where the holes are drilled into the side of the watch to hold the pins that hold the watch band has broken repeatedly. Now once again for the 5th time it has broken in the same manner. I bought this watch since it has a memory of 300 laps and I am a Ultra runner. But from what I consider normal use. Running and using the button to record a lap. this watch has repeatedly broken. I cannot be the only one this has happened to since now it has happened in the same mannor in the same place 5 times in 5 different watches.
3,JUNIOR WALKER LIVES,"Yeah,I'm a sucker for Don Byron-and Junior Walker.I grew up in Detroit with Junior Walker and the Motown sound-and I've been a fan of Byron's ever since I first heard him play clarinet with the Klezmer Conservatory Orchestra.This just isn't as good as....seeing him do it live at the 2007 Detroit Jazz Festival;here's hoping he comes back in '08 for a little Junior Walker or Mickey Katz or Bug Music or jazz .By the way,in 2007,he saved 'Shotgun' for a killer encore.(my fingers aren't working-I meant to give it a 4 plus)"
4,Worthy Tribute,"As something of a Junior Walker fan and connoisseur I was interested in how a a great Jazz man like Don Byron would interpret some of Junior's work. The Soul Session tracks and Cleo's Mood do lend themselves to a Jazz interpretation and he does make the most of it, particularly Cleo's Mood, Mark Anthony Speaks and Satan's Blues. Warm renditions and funky improvisations by all of the band.Perhaps what is lacking though is the raw, spiky even crude production values of the originals that made them stand out against the 'usual' gloss of most of Motown's output of the time. The non Junior track 'There it is' (James Brown) also stands out and it's probably the nearest the band gets to a raw funky sound.Nevertheless, it is enjoyable, and as a fan I am just pleased that some overdue recognition is made to a much underrated musician who's influence is always readily acknowledged by many sax players and few else."
1,Utter rubbish,"I am speechless!. The special sound of Autry DeWalt, better known as Jr. Walker is butchered by Don Byron...Stick to Avant Garde, my friend, and don't sully the memory of a soul giant"
3,Norpro Stainless Steel French Fry Cutter,"I bought this as a replacement. Although it works, it only allows for cutting small to medium/small potatos. Also, the blade sometimes comes out. On the other hand, the fries are large enough for the most part and so far the cutter appears to have the necessary strength."
