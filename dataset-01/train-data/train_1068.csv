3,Charlie Chan Vol 1.,"I never saw Charlie Chan before. They are dated being prior to WW2, but pleasant to watch. Presumably the later volunes are less dated.Dave"
2,5 star films - 1 star quality,"DIASATER FROM FOX!!!!!! The four Chan films are GREAT - even the Spanish one is fun with the strangest Chan ever - but the prints are disasters!!! They must have been rescued from Hurricane Katrina. It seems the great Chan ban is still in effect since Fox did their best to sabotage this box. And the price is ridiculous for four discs with five features and three interesting - but short featurettes. Fox was so desperate to fill this very overprices box that they reused the Charlie Chan in London trailer four times.One can only guess that the ""politically correct"" boys at Fox are still in control over Chan and threw the Chan clan a bone but one with no meat on it. With this releasse Fox disgraced itself and let the world know that Charlie Chan, to them, rates a -100 on a scale from 1 to 10. ""Size of package does not indicate quality within."" -unnamed, unwanted (at Fox) Chinese detective from (1936) CHARLIE CHAN AT THE CIRCUS."
3,"thanks a lot, world...","censorship sucks, but at the same time, i'd like to thank the film industry for so many wonderful years of yellow face and now, it's continuation..."
2,YUK!!!,Yuk!. I thought this compilation was several features on one disc. But it's not. One movie pper disc. The video quality on some is atrocious. Overpriced and unworthy. I have all but discarded most of the volume. Would never purchase this company or perhaps Amazon again.
3,esrly Charlie Chan,This collection includes four early Chan films made in the 1930s. The picture quality is often grainy and the sound quality sometimes mediocre. But the subtitles are fine and complete. The story lines and dialogue is often unintentionally funny. But it is interesting to see what Hollywood did to the real-life character in Biggers books.
4,Above Average Set,"The supplemental features are definitely a plus for this set and I enjoyed them very much. They give a lot of background on the character and the films, and the restoration efforts. The film restoration is good, but not great; don't expect the picture restoration on the level of that done for Citizen Kane or Casablanca: you can still see scratches and flicker, but not so much as to bother your viewing. I'm happy with this set and hope it will lead to another release of Chan films soon."
4,Charlie Chan Collection Vol.1,"It is better than I expected, considering the dates that were filmed.mtb"
5,"Charlie Chan collection, Vol 1",What can be said that already has not? Either you love Charlie or you don't. These are wonderful films.
4,"Charlie Chan Collection, Vol. 1","Very Entertaining, if you like classic movies which have character and substance."
4,Good to see an old friend,"After the MGM boxed set of latter lesser titles (albeit wonderful prints) it's great to have the ""classic"" Chan to see again after all these years. Bring on the next set."
4,"Charlie Chan Collection, Vol. 1","I enjoyed the collection, because the sound and video quality is very good."
5,"At last, one of my favorites back on DVD","I've been waiting for the Charlie Chan series to hit dvd for a very long time. And I'm not disappointed. I've enjoyed all four movies in this set very much. Even though the movies are pretty old they don't seem to be very dated at all.The plots are very well thought out too, not so easy to guess. If you like mystery movies, you will really enjoy these. I can't wait to get set two!The bonus features are a very nice bonus, it was great to see who the Chan character was loosly based on."
3,Simple entertainment,Bought this as a gift. I have it also. We both like the old black and white who-done-its. Nostalgia is the main driver here. I watched these on TV as a kid and still like them though they are obviously outdated.
4,Very Impressed,"I was very impressed as to the quality of the sound and pictures on these DVDs. It is fun to look back and see how politically incorrect and prejudiced people where back in the thirties. I also liked that through the durration of the ""Charlie Chan in Shanghi"" movie there was no mention of opium even though thats what the dealers were smuggling, this makes the film watchable for most ages. The extras on the DVDs were also very informative and enjoyable. I look forward to watching the second volume."
2,Not the greatest,"I purchased another brand at a local store about a year ago and they were awesome! (well...if you like bugs) These bugs looked more like they were picked up off the ground and put in the boxes. Just not real detailed and a little, ""dead."" However, that is because I had something to compare to. Maybe if you've never seen them before, you will like. Just OK."
2,Not A Greatest Hits Collection,This is not a greatest hits collection as implied in the cd's title. These are primarily recent recordings of some popular soul tunes originally recorded by other artists. Ms. Knight's voice is heavy and plodding - reminiscent of a drag queen's. Not worth the near twenty-eight bucks.
5,reel lawn mower,"Easy to handle, light weight. I can hear my radio and anything else that is going on! I still have to get rid of some weeds to be able to use it only. I like it very much."
4,reel mower,Has been 2 summers now since I bought this baby and still working like new- great for small flat lawns.
3,Lightweight but not robust enough,"I like the weight of this mower, but I'm disappointed that the design doesn't let me cut close enough to fences/side of house, etc.. My husband picked it out and he's a mechanical grenius and reads fine print and specs and all, and I'm sure for what we wanted to pay, it had the best reviews and specs and design.But I'm the one who mows the lawn and the mower gets hung up on a thick dead leaf or a clump of dead bermuda grass and I have stop and pull it backward to clear the clog.Last summer I used my neighbor's reel mower (Scott brand I think) and I much prefer it for getting closer to things (wheels didn't take up so much space). It would hang up fairly easily, too, but not as easily as this one. But it was also nearly twice the weight.So, all in all, this mower does the job without wearing me out and for a reasonable price so I guess I can't ask more than that."
1,Horrible customer service,"I purchased another mower, the Sunlawn MM1 from Amazon. Out of the box, it seemed great, until it broke - on it's first trip around my lawn. (The adjustment arm casting broke). No problem, living in Colorado, where Sunlawn is located, I decided to call the manufacturer direct to resolve the issue. They were very friendly and said that they would send out a new part. Weeks passed, no part. This pattern repeated itself more than once. Me: ""Maybe you had the wrong address."" Them: ""Oh, right, we'll send it out."" Me: ""I still haven't received my part."" Them: ""Let me look in back and call you back."" Me: (several days later) ""Hey, how 'bout that part."" Them: ""Right, just checking in back, we'll send that along right now."" Deceptive? Ultimately, fed up, I called Amazon and had to return the mower (kudos to Amazon for their customer service!)."
4,Good so far,"with our late spring weather, we haven't gotten as much use from this mower as we had planned. We have tried it on thick northern climate grass and found what other reviewer have commented; not so good on wet grass, and you may need to make more than one pass if you allow the grass to get too long.As for the mower itself, I've noticed that it requires more adjustment than advertised. When it arrived, the blades touched the cutter (manual say's they shouldn't). After adjusting it and using it on a larger yard (close to 10,000 sq ft) it required adjusting again. Hope this doesn't continue to be a problem."
1,AVOID! ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE!,"Don't waste your money! I bought an LMM-40. It's still under warranty, but the retailer closed up shop, the manufacturer (Sunlawn) does not return email or phone calls, and I can't even *buy* the $1 part I need."
4,More plastic than I thought but it works great!,"I guess I'm a bit of a throwback to the good ole days but I was expecting something a bit more substantial. These days you reduce weight by making it out of plastic. I was somewhat disappointed in the amount of plastic on the machine...even the wheels seems to be PVC. To me it cheapens the overall product. This certainly isn't my grandfather's reel mower of memory.That said, it is light, setup was very easy, and the thing works great. I have a townhome and a small back yard so I'm done in 10 minutes but I could easily see a larger yard being mowed this way. I love the distinct lack of noise! I bought this after my rechargeable B&D; mower's battery went out. This cost a little more than the battery and it should last much, much, longer!"
1,Customer support issues (are they out of business?)-TERRIBLE,"We purchased Model MM-1 last summer (07). Loved it until it broke this spring(08) under normal use. It came with a two year warranty. We contacted the company through phone (full mailbox) and email. Received an automated email response a month ago that ""issue will be resolved"". Have heard nothing since. Voicemail is still full and email contact no longer working...absolutely no satisfaction and no way to get in touch! I would stay away from this company even though I love their ""green"" aspect."
3,Good Show & Tell Item,"Much smaller than expected; I gave this item to my 4 & 7 year old grandsons with their eyes closed; hands held out for even more ""Show & Tell"" fun, which added to the over-all ""fun"" effect. A great gift for kids who like creepy things..not much play value at all, other than to show it off to friends."
3,Smaller and less in-tact than expected...,"I was surprised at how small the ""Giant"" ant seemed to be. I'm pretty sure I've seen larger ants behind my kitchen sink (I guess they're very well fed though ...) These bugs were very small, and looked a bit... Crinkly?I've since learned that bug specimens like this can be purchased at local oddities stores, or from artists... If you're into the idea, you can even make them yourself!For the same money, we purchased a giant tarantula from a nearby artist. Our new spider is way more impressive than all four of these crumpled buggies combined."
4,great,These were smaller than I had expected but the children are still enjoying them. One has a chip in the side which is a bit sad.
3,"Not the best, but still pretty good","I would not say this is a classic cd, but it is still good nonetheless. Nice jams like forget about dre, still dre among others but some get lost in the mix with tracks that could have been left out off the cd."
3,Dre always makes a masterpiece!,"I really wanted to give this CD four stars, but I couldn't find enough good songs. I gave it three stars because I absolutely love the Next Episode! I practically worship the song, and the clean version can be listened to in public. I like Still DRE and Forgot About Dre too, so those are very good raps! But once you get bored of just those two songs, you get sick of the CD! I can't ever get sick of the Next Episode! But this CD is not worth the buy for me because I already have the Next Episode on a compilation CD. But if you don't have any songs on other CDs this is a good buy, not great. The price is a bit expensive though for its worth if you are trying to save."
5,CLASSIC...DRE IZ BACK!,"Man, this album is by far the best rap album since N.W.A.'s ""Straight outta Compton."" it has 22 tracks, plus a hilarious outro. i love dre's style! best songs are #11, #10, #3, #4, #12, #13, #15, #17, and #19. (#18 is pretty funny, too!) buy this album and keep it real, brotha!"
4,OVERALL GOOD CD,IT IS AN OVERALL GOOD CD BUT THE PROBLEM IS DRE DOES NOT DO ENOUGH RAPPIN. I MEAN LOOK AT THE CD LIST. IN EVERY SINGLE SONG SOMEONE ELSE IS HELPING DRE SING BESIDES ONE. I NOT PUTTING HIM DOWN BECAUSE I OWN THIS CD AND THE MARSHALL MATHERS LP BY EMINEM. BUT HE NEEDS TO LEARNED TO WALK ON HIS OWN WITHOUT THE HELP OF OTHER RAPPERS LIKE EMINEM.
3,Dr.Dre 2001,"I think that this album is ok, but for sure, Dr.Dre can't touch Eazy E. I like the songs F*** You, Still Dre, and the next episode, but if you want some real gangsta rap, than just pick up an Eazy E album."
1,"Great album, but it was scratched","When I opened the vinyl and started playing it, it was skipping from the beginning and continued throughout the album. Very disapointed"
4,Review,"Very please with my purchase. Received item in a timely manner, within two business days. Great purchase and great service. Very, Very, Pleased."
5,"Love this CD, will leave you laughing.","What can i say, i love this cd, the beats are great, the delivery is solid. But the best part is the humor, if your'e like me, you don't take rap too seriously since there hasn't been an orginal rap lyric since the mid 80's. The best tracks are education, explosive, still d.r.e. But in fact this whole album is packed with great tracks. Find somebody with this album and get a cd burner."
3,Good,"I enjoyed a lot of the songs on this CD. Dr. Dre is talented in that he is able to come up with an almost all new west coast sound. Lyrically it's as though he hasn't grown since 1992 and some of the new rappers on this CD (hittman- ughh) are not nearly as good as the original Chronic cast of rappers which included Snoop Doggy Dogg and tha Dogg Pound's first appearances. I'd suggest ""Dr. Dre- The Chronic"" (1992) before I'd suggest this one, but if you're buying it for Eminem get this one.This is one of the best of 1999 but that does't say much when you have artists like Jay Z (weak delivery) and DMX (absolutely no delivery, more like annoying yelling) putting out their respective CDs. Must-haves for 1999 are these: Eminem Slim Shady LP cd, 2Pac + Outlawz Still I Rise cd, this CD, Nas - I AM cd and Pastor Troy- We Ready I Declare war. If you got those 5 you got all the good ones of 1999."
3,Dre only put effort into about 3-5 songs,"Now this cd is tight and I have heard most of it. But some of the songs are just not good. Whats the difference, forgot about dre and still dre, are the best songs, but the rest are just not that phat."
4,pretty tight,it's a tight a$$ cd but dre should form a new nwa group featuring snoop and cube that'll be phat or maybe not
2,"Dre, What Happened?","The music on this CD is lame. The beats almost totally rely on one piano key being repeatedly pressed over and over again. A child could ""create"" beats like this. Hey, where's my 2 year old cousin at? Let's make a cd..."
3,"Blah, blah, blah","The only people eho are giving this album 5 stars are the people who are wishing that west coast rap will jump into the forefront again. And it's going to take alot more than this to make that happen. Beside The Watcher and X-Plosion, theirs nothing here that you'd remember past the lenth of the album. Part of it is due to the lyrics. They talk about the same old stuff, and they're so redundant it makes a Too Short verse about pimpin' look new and innovative. And as far as Eminem playing the same roll as Snoop did on the origonal Chronic? No. Snoop & dre fit toghther like hand and glove, and Snoop should've been on here more. The title alone on this album was worth about two million in sales. Don't get me wrong, this is a good album. Just don't expect it to be in your stereo six months from now."
2,Fallen Off From The Original,"This CD did have a large number of artists, but still lacks greatly and is nowhere near as good as the original Chronic. Just as Dre, the Chronic has really fallen off. I really would suggest you did NOT buy this CD, but the original Chronic and Chronic 2000 Still Smokin' would be worth your money."
2,Extremely Overrated,"Don't get me wrong: Snoop and Eminem are great rappers and shine on the two songs they are each on. Dre just is not nearly as good as a producer as he used to be. The beats aren't tight, heavy with wailing keyboard in the background. They're clunky, mechanical, rushed sounding. It's Dre's first album in 8 years and he seems to have spent only the last few months working on this album. I heard that Dr. Dre is a perfectionist: DOES NOT SHOW on this particular album.I mean you've got some jamming tracks. I really liked ""Still DRE"" and ""Forgot about Dre"" as well as ""the Watcher"" and ""what's the difference."" But overrall this CD is not very good. It's the kind of CD where you find yourself skipping song after song."
2,"A Sincere Effort, But too boring","This CD is a quality effort by dre but I was expecting much more than what I actually got from the CD. I dunno the beats just weren't creative and there was only one good bass song...there are only 2 songs I ever listened more than once or twice on this CD: the one featuring Eminem (""Forgot About Dre""), and track 21 (""Bang Bang""). The beats didn't really interest me, unlike his first CD. If you have the same musical tastes as everyone else out there, buy this album...cuz obviously a bunch of peeps like it (as u can tell from all these friggin reviews). However, if u think you only like creative beats and good melodies and stuff then maybe consider getting something else (like Jay-Z...now that's a tight CD)"
5,It's all good,This CD is well worth getting. This CD has much more depth than other CD's And it really has meaning. Eminem rules in this CD. My personal favorites are Forgot About DRE and Time 4 Porn
4,Still got love for the street,"What more can be said about the D.R.E.? Master producer, groundbreaking artist, and hip-hop's most trusted talent scout (Snoop Dogg, Eminem), Dre's seen and done it all. So it's no wonder why, in terms of rapping, he's decided to keep a bit in the background on his second album, 2001. Like The Chronic, the good doctor delivers more cameos than a Tupac album (and trust me, that's saying something). Even Eddie Griffin weighs in on his views of the world, especially on the hilarious skit ""Ed-ucation"". Yet it's quite clear that Dre's running the show. From the beginning of the intro (TO BE CONTINUED"
3,An album with 2 sides by the Godfather of Hip Hop,"I'll keep it short. Dre is surely the god of Hip Hop, but I've expected a little more. The Songs are produced perfectly, no1 does it like Dre, but something is missing. I dont unnderstand why the words ""Dre"" ""the chronic"" and so on can be heard a billion times on this CD. We know that you're the greatest Dre, You dont have to say it again and again! The CD is good, but I'll rather listen to Slim Shadys new CD, where Dre does what he can best...produce!"
2,TOO MANY GUESTS ON DRE,"I THOUGHT I BOUGHT THE NEW DRE ALBUM BUT REALLY IT WAS CHRONIC 2001...WITH SPECIAL GUEST, DR.DRE. I REALLY WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO DRE TEARING IT UP, BUT WAS DISAPPOINTED.I BOUGHT THE CD FOR DRE,NOT EVERYONE AND THEIR MOMS. I DON'T MEAN TO DIS DRE, I KNOW HE IS A GREAT PRODUCER BUT WHY ALL THE GUESTS?. OUT OF 22 TRACKS, 5 WERE REALLY SLAMMING. BUT ALL DRE TALKS ABOUT IS HOW HE BROUGHT US EAZY E, D.O.C., ICECUBE AND NWA. IF HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT, IT'S HOW HE'S BACK AND EVERYONE WILL REGRET TALKING BAD ABOUT DRE. HE HAS A FEATURED GUEST ON ALMOST EVERY TRACK. NOT TO MENTION BEING A HIPOCRIT. TALKING ABOUT HOW HE IS A FAMILY MAN NOW BUT THEN RAPS ABOUT HOW HIS SEXUAL EXPLOITS WITH OTHER WOMAN. REAL FAMILY LIKE.I WAITED 5 YEARS TO HEAR A CAR BOMB SKIT? REAL CLASSIC! I SPENT TOO MUCH TIME SKIPPING TRACKS BECAUSE THE INTROS TO THE SONGS WERE JUST TERRIBLE. I KNOW DRE CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS."
2,listen up,"GREAT BEATS no one can do it better, but dre needs better things to talk about,i mean he talks about how great he is,he talks about himself,chronic and ho's. he has a few songs where he has good things to say but not much. so only problem is the lyrics."
2,Foget about Dre,"I bought this CD because I thought it would be good. I was wrong. Out of the 22 tracks on it, there is only 4 maybe 5 good ones. If you want to hear something good, go buy the new DMX or wait until the resurrection of Bone Thgs-N-Harmony, the best rap group ever!"
5,New Chronic Sound,"------Dr. Dre has masturfully perfected the G-funk sound and has created a new sound... Chronic Funk; all while bringing intelligence and ""realness"" back to hip-hop. A great follow up to Snoop's first album...Doggystyle! Remember who the real trendsetter in hip-hop is! One Love."
3,TOO MUCH GUESTS,"I waited for dre's album for a long time but he keeps delaying it, but when I got it I was deeply dissapointed cuz the lack of guests. damn he has alot of guests in each song (why was m&m in the album. he iz the wackiest mc in hip hop history) The best song was still dre."
1,NO!,"This is pathetic. I can't see why everyone likes Eminem or Dre. They suck. All the songs on this album sound the same, except Still DRE, which is the only decent song on this! DON'T BUY THIS! BUY DMX AND JAYZ(way better by far! ) Ya das right"
5,Just like the Chronic,"I've listened to the original a million times, this one is just like the first, with new tracks. People complain about how many guests are on the cd, but look at the Chronic and you will see there were just as many guests. SNoop dogg isn't on as many of the tracks, which is too bad, but he is a big star now, and he wasn't back then when he did the original chronic. All the tracks on this cd are good. Also there is only one skit track. More for your money."
3,dre coulda came up with more good songs than were on the CD,"there aren't enough good songs on this CD. yeah sure theres about 3 great songs on there- Still Dre, Forgot About Dre, and The Next Episode. The other songs are alright or just plain bad. I would think that out of 21 songs on the CD (not including the intro) i would expect more out of this so-called west coast legend. hes lost some of the touch he had on his previous CDs and still cant match up to Snoop Dogg or 2Pac. If you want a great rap CD, check out one of Snoops CDs (except for Da Game Is To Be Sold, Not To Be Told cuz that is Snoop's worst CD)or check out the best rap CD of all time which is Tupacs All Eyez On Me. if you dont have these CDs, go out and buy them. if you do have these CDs, then you probably know exactly what im talking about."
3,Good but not the best,"First of all lets get this straight, this is a good album but it is not even close to being better then the first Chronic. The first Chronic is probably the best rap album ever. Dr. Dre's second album,Aftermath, was ok. This is a notch above Aftermath. Overall the songs are weak but there a strong songs that make up for other ones in it. Snoop Dog should have been in this a lot more I really dont know why he was not. Buy this CD but only buy it because its a Dr. Dre CD."
4,good but not great,"The beats are magical, and the tones are smooth and easy to groove to. This is straight gangsta rap-put this on when you're going down the highway late at night and you just want to lay low. Snoop Dogg's contributions to the album are just right. You can't help but love his style of rap, the lazy, smooth drawl. And Dr. Dre is bigger and better than ever on this album. However, Dr. Dre scarcely performs by himself on this thing. I think we all miss that. Also, some songs can be boring in the lyrics. With this being gangsta rap, most of the songs are about vodka, scams, and cruisin' down the street in a 67' Buick smoking fat Cuban cigars. The style gets old.Overall, this album is good, but not great. If you love rap, get it . Great songs are Still D.R.E., The Next Episode, and Forgot About Dre. On his next effort, let's pray that Dr. Dre can do a little better than on this one. If all of his songs are as good as the highlights on this one, that'll be no problem!"
4,In the house!,"Dr.Dre,You rule.I love you new CD,even if you got snoop as one of your people.Besides this minor flaw,I hope you get to the top and have fun doing it.Peace."
3,An uneven album,"This album could have been a classic, but the contrast between the material in the first and halves of the CD prevent it from being so.The first 13 tracks and ""The Message"" are up to Dre's usual high standards, but the next 9 are not up to par and sound out of place on this album. Songs like ""Forgot About Dre"", ""Still DRE"" and ""F**k You"" are vastly superior to tracks like ""Murder Ink"" and ""Housewife""(which is just a rehash of a song from Kurupt's album). If Dre had cut tracks 14-21, this would have been a classic like the Chronic.This is a problem seen on many releases today. Just because the CD can hold 79 minutes of music is no reason to use all of the space. The Chronic was only about 60 min long, but all the tracks were hot.If you're a Dre fan, get this album. If you're not, then borrow it and see if you like all the songs before getting this."
4,Pretty good but original was better,"I bought this album with some pretty high expectations of what dre could do considering his first album ""The Chronic"" revolutionized rap. At first I was disappointed in the album but after listening to it for a while it really grew on me. Although I enjoy the beats and the lyrics this album seems to have nothing new and revolutionary and does not COMPARE to the original."
3,Not so Y2k,"This album for Dre has its high points as well as some very low ones. Tracks such as ""still D.r.e."" continue to talk about Dre being back. I never knew that he left. He is taking it to far, no one dissed him. So he needs to stop saying he's back and come out with a song that shows he is ready to be a contenter for Best rapper of 2k."
4,"yeah, he's a doctor of production","good return by dre. the guests bring back the west coast funk along with more misogyny than an adult store in the french quarter. the album definitely loses steam in the latter songs, and constantly reminding us that he's back may turn off others. but who ever listened to dre for subject depth? it's about beats, and these ones are so inspired that you know it's the dre."
5,This cd is absolutely amazing,This cd is one of the few cd's i can i actually listen to straight through and love almost every song. It is truly a piece of art. It sounds west coast and classic dre. If you pick up any cd this is the one to get first. I guarantee you'll be getting your moneys worth.
5,Certified Dope,"This is best rap cd in years. At first I thought it was OK, but after listening to it a few times, I kept catching something different on the cd that I missed before. I've had it for 5 months and can still listen to the whole thing without skipping songs. Nate Dogg and Kurupt shine. Eminem, Hittman, and Snoop are all tight. This cd is great. Thanks for taking me back, Dre."
4,HONEST REVIEW,"OK i was reading through these reviews and some of the people are right. it is kinda weak in some points. FIRST OF ALL XXXPLOSIVE is the tightest song and i dont care what anyone else has to say. that being said, on with the review. as another reviewer mentioned, the reason why it did not get a 5 from me is the fact that the beginning of the cd is tight, but towards the end, the songs start getting weaker. its still a MUST BUY. this is the tightest cd out right now. nothing out right now can touch this. Jay-z's cd is alright, because it has a song with dre on it. but his beats are like BLAH right now. so go get both of these cats' albums."
5,2001- Respect to Dre,"what can i say about this CD? i have been DJ'ing Garage fo the past 3 years, i've always loved B.I.G (rest in peace, and this an album the big man himself would be proud of. its fresh and snoop and DRE make a wicked combo. there is some wicked vocals from slim & hittman. this is one of the only albums i own that i can listen to every day and listen to every track. DRE got it sorted with this one all those fake rappers better listen and take notes."
2,Pitiful,"According to a line in ""Still D.R.E."", Dr. Dre states he still takes his time perfecting beats...in this CD, that ain't so. If you're hoping to hear tracks that'll hit you like ""The Chronic"", don't waste your time. I wish I had listened to it in a sound booth first before I bought it. The only cuts worth listening to are ""Still D.R.E."", of course, and the cut with Eminem."
2,VERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRY DISAPPOINTED!,"I SPENT ALMOST TOO MUCH ON BOTH THE CD AND VINYL, NOW I'M VERY ANGRY! THIS CD DOESN'T SOUND ANYTHING ON THE LEVEL OF THE CHRONIC OR DOGGYSTYLE! THIS CD IS ALLLLL HYPE! THERE ARE SOME GOOD SONGS ON THE CD BY EMINEM, DEVIN, AND SNOOP IS ALL RIGHT, BUT NOTHING IS ""GREAT"" OR ""GROUNDBREAKING!"" I THOUGHT DRE WAS GONNA BLOW MY MIND, BUT HE DIDN'T! I WISH I WOULD'VE BOUGHT KURUPT'S CD! PLEASEEEEEEE, SAVE YOUR MONEY...IT'S NOT WORTH IT!"
2,Its not Dre's fault.,"Dr Dre is one of the VERY FEW artists who i know I want to buy there album before I hear cut one off of it. (along with Cube). So you can imagine my disappointmen when I popped this CD into my deck.My problem is simple, severe lack of talented rappers. The beats are decent and even head knocking on a few tracks. However they are far and in between. Instead what you have is a mix of every rapper you have never heard of (of Snoop is there but enough with the ""lo lo's""). Its no coincidense the 2 best tracks are those with Eminem on them. Those 2 almost make the album worth buying. I know ill have to think twice before buying his next one. Maybe the NWA reunion will be beter."
1,There's No Describing this wreck,"This is the sellout album from dr. dre, remember backin the days of NWA and Death Row he used to be so good and anti-commercial pop, but now he's with pop rap stars themselvesthis album is a mess, poor rapping, good beats aren't enough to save this wreck, Dr. Dre you may have gain respectfor the 106 & Park/TRL Crowd, but you have lost your original 101 proof and respect of 110% percent hardcore gangsta rap and fansand ever since he supported the R.I.A.A And sued napsterDr. Dre has turned into the greediest sellouts since metallica.Take a look at their former co-hortsSpice 1, Kurupt, Scarface, never sold out of their fansthey play at small clubs and give good music to true fansunlike going multiplatinum (with trash) to poser fanslike dr. dre has didDre is nothing with the late tupac shakurwho's probably rolling at his grave sitein north carolina with his ashesDre is nothing without Eazy E And Tupac Shakurnot even close"
3,Ok but could be better,I don't get why half his songs are telling how great he is. I don't think he should bragg about being on drugs. Being on drugs shouldn't be a good thing. But besides the lyrics its pretty cool and Dre still has the beat.
2,Obviously I am in the minority,"Having been a big fan of the original Chronic, this album sort of disappointed me. It may be that is has not grown on me yet. However, the first album just jumped out at me as a classic. I admit that I may just be prejudice toward the first album thus not giving this one a fair review. But in the times I have listened to it, I just do not feel it yet."
5,ITS A BOMB,"I LIKE IT TOO MUCH THAT I LISTEN TO IT EVERY DAY,buy it and you wont be disapointed,with a lot of collaborations,snoopdog,eminem,exhibit,maryj blige ...."
4,2001 is different,"Dr. Dre adapted well to the change of the times...however, not 100%. Some songs on this album are just not up to what Dre has in him. Some of the beats seemed rushed if though he says he still takes the time to perfect the beat...seems these days hes more worried about eminem's cds and 50 cents cd to make all of his songs as tight as theirs..either way its still a great cd. Snoop Dogg makes excellent appearances throughout and it's overall one of the better rap albums you can buy."
2,Disappointing,"This album by Dre does not live up to the expectations I had. It's not even close to being as good as the original Chronic. The problem with this album is its excessive production---Dre perfected it too much. It's produced much like an R and B album in my opinion in terms of the production but I guess that's why its been so commercially accepted. The 8 years between albums showed. In a time where rappers take too little time between albums, Dre took too long. The rawness of Gangsta Rap is lacking in this one. I hope he sticks to producing for Snoop and Xzibit from now on."
4,Awesome CD!,I went on vacation with a friend of mine and her brother had this CD. I took it from him to listen to it and would NOT take it out of my CD player or stop listening to it! I love this CD and Dr. Dre is an awesome artist. All the people that he features on this album (especially Eminem!) are awesome and the Cd is great!
3,Could Be Better,I thought it would be better. It does has some phat tracks.Like Still D.R.E. and Forgot About Dre.Some beats are killa.I rated it three stars because theres 2 many tracks and theres only 5 good songs.
3,not bad,"Don't get this expecting some new flavor that you have not heard before. Dre spent a lot of time in the studio working on this one, and it shows, but it aint nothing new, take my word for it. It is for sure worth a listen or two though. Peace."
4,THE DOCTOR IS BACK,"This CD is definitely off the hook. Dr. Dre comes back with a vengeance on this disc. 21 thumping tracks, including some funny skits. Snoop and Dre really tear it up on Still D.R.E. And Eminem lays down a solid hook and verse on Forgot about Dre. If you are a person who listens to rap, go pick this up, you will be glad."
5,Incredible CD to vibe with,"If you are looking for a great album to party to or just listen to, this album fits the bill. The lyrics don't have the complexity that Jay-z and Nas have but they are still good. Basically this album is great to just lay back and vibe with."
5,Dr.Dre Kicks Butt!!,Dr.Dre is ausome he is so much better than all those other losers out there.He is probally the best rapper ever.Who ever said he turned pop...Shut Up!! Dont get ludacris or chingy get DRE!!
3,Not bad but not as huge as advertised,"Dont get me wrong, Dr. Dre is probably the greatest rapper out there, and this album is good. But its not great. ""Forgot About Dre"" with Eminem is wonderful and catchy but the rest of the album is decent and dull at times."
4,good,i dug the production and having nate dogg and snoop was cool.but way to many guests that almost overshadow dre.but i like some of the arrangements here and the chances he takes musically.lyrically it leaves alot to be desired.but that's never been dre's bag it's beats and grooves and he delivers.the cut with mary j bliege is deep.in fact mary j should have dre do her next record.i would have liked to heard dre&quik bang up a groove.so it's good but not great.he has been banging grooves for 2 decades.
3,It's below our expectations...,"I have to say that I've been waiting for this album with high hopes. I thought that DRE's first album after 7 years will be the bomb, but unfortunately it's just GOOD. DRE has totally changed his sound - there's no sign of G-FUNK, which made him so famous. It boils down to just one point - if you are expecting another CHRONIC, KEEP THEIR HEADS... or CALIFORNIA LOVE you will be disappointed because there are no hits of that caliber on the album. The best track are: Still DRE, Big Egos and Forgot About DRE."
2,What the hell...,"Apparentely those beats he's supposively perfecting aren't on this album. Over half the albums beats sound the same. I don't know why Dre calls this his album, 15 damn people are featured on every song. Pulling a Master P? If I didn't know better, I would say that this album was strictly made to make money, riding on the success of the chronic. He only raps by himself for ONE song, and it's kind of weak. Getting sick of all these whack producers putting out 20 albums a year and all the suckers that go out and buy them (i.e. Cash Money and No Limit.) I suggest to purchase the real stuff, Outkast, Black Eyed Peas, Jurassic 5. Don't buy the album, you'll hear the only two good songs of the ablum on the radio soon enough."
5,still a g thang,"good beats and raps. good guests on the album. best songs are, f**k you f/ snoop & devin the dude,still d.r.e. f/snoop,xxplosive f/kurupt,hittman,nate dogg,& six-two,big egos f/hittman,next episod f/snoop,forgot about dre f/eminem,what's the difference f/eminem & xzibit, and some l.a. n**gaz f/time bomb,mc ren,king t,kokane,knoc-turn'al,xzibit& defari"
5,Best of Dre!,Hello everybody! This is one of Dre's best CD's out there!! He's got everybody in it from Eminem to Snoop Dog! You name the person and he's in here!! This is a must buy for any rap fans out there! I saw the Up in Smoke concert 2 days ago and it was well worth it!!
4,What 's Up Doc Can we Rock,S'up Y'all.Once again Dr Dre proves that he still has it.Though the album is not as good as the previous ones but believe me there are some cool tracks on this one. I recommend that you get your copy and don't be surprise if you're surprised. I have start the new Millenium with this album.Cool Uh.
5,still D.R.E.,THE ALBUM WAS TIGHT! ALMOST EVERY SONG WAS STREET.DRE SHOWS ALL YOU PUNKS WHY HE STILL THE D.R.E.
4,DRE IS BACK,Dre 2001 is a killa album. He and eminem are flowin. There is a wide range of bass lines and tempos that keep you listening to the whole cd. This is one of those you will keep in your car cd player for weeks!
4,The Doctor is in!,Dre is back with this CD and has a lot of help from a ton of his homeboys. I think this is his best CD yet and this will go platinum. Dre and Snoop and Eminem are awesome and will be on the top for a long time
4,Very Good Work from Dr. Dre,"Dr. Dre has come out with another fine album, featuring the likes of many artists including Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige, and more. The first single, 'Still Dre', has a really cool beat and the rapping is great! But probably the best song is Forgot About Dre featuring Eminem. Dr. Dre describes his own life and the jealousy of others towards him. He also describes-it is true to the song's title-about people who forgot about him after his first albums and then came back begging when he struck it rich. Other good songs are The Next Episode, Big Egos, and Hittman's Ackrite as well as the ending song Message.Certainly an album that all rap fans should have in their collections!"
4,Don't forget dre...its not the last episode,"this is a great return for dre. its a tight album, and most all of the songs are good, and the ones that are popular, are qute good, unlike eminem, who gets old...dre is just as good everytime, so if you like dre style rap, get this"
4,Rap Album of the Year?,"No doubt about it, Dr. Dre has once again come up with a brilliant rap recording with fresh beats and compelling soundscapes, skits that don't burn out after the first couple of spins, and one superb, ear-arresting track after another. For the haters that declared Dre was ovah while they bit his style, ""2001"" is vindication and then some. My favorite cuts? ""Let's Get High,"" ""Still Dre,"" ""What's the Difference,"" ""Next Episode,"" the hilarous ""Pause for Porno"" and tender (yep, I did say tender) ""The Message"" with a whole stack of Mary J. Bliges in the background. Maybe the best rap album of the year, definitely one of the best albums of any genre of the year. And yes...it is misogynistic, drug friendly and offensive."
5,Dre is Back,"2001 is da bomb'... Dre is back... and back wit a BANG! The songs: the next episode, is the best... it has a sweet beat. Forgot about Dre is awesome, along with the tribute to his brother (#22, the message) it is a great cd, hot new songs and great meanings"
5,Blazing.,"Don't even think of sleeping on this. Pick it up immediately. As you might expect, production is close to flawless. Lyrically, it's as witty and interesting as they come. I always thought he was talented, but now I'm convinced that Dr. Dre is a professional musician."
5,Still on top of the hip-hop game,"Dr. Dre's ""The Chronic"" paved the way for gangsta rap in the 90s, and even the decade's best rap titles sound are little more than blatant imitations of Dre's meticulously constructed, multi-layered grooves. AFter eight years of waiting, Dre has finally released his official follow-up album ""Chronic 2001."" Thankfully, the result is worth the wait. Dre's beats are as catchy as ever, and the vast array of musical resources he draws from on this album will have lesser DJs scrambling to catch up. Most of the young talent employed on the album performs well and longtime collaborators like Snoop Dogg and Eminem make multiple appearances. Dre himself now plays the role of the self-assured veteran, his raps are no longer as much about boasting as they are his honest views about the state of affairs in hip-hop. This title is a neccessity for fans of rap."
4,HMMM COOL,"really good cd but not like old chronic, he has too many guests and too many of his lyrics talk bout him coming back to rapping and talking bout everyone forgtting him, still cool tho"
5,ONE OF THE BEST,"To all of you mother f***ers who say Dre is a sellout. I say F*** YOU. What the hell you expect him to do. You all come down on him just because hes smart enough to go corperate, make his money, and realize his dreams. F*** YOU. Anyone who hates on Dre would be lucky to be half the man he is. And what the hell do you all try and prove?? All that callin him a teenybop mainstream pop sellout just give publicity. Your doin him a god damn favor. Dre helped make rap what it is, and everyone comes down on him for tryin something new, if it wasnt for him you dumb f***s wouldnt know the difference between what hes doin now and what he did 10 years ago. If you cant respect someone for livin it up, makin their money, and workin hard for it. Then youll never repect anyone worth havin respect for. This album is one of the best. To all you haters F*** YOU"
3,If Dre was a new artist.,"This album gets three starsfrom me because its Dre'sfollow-up to the first chronic album. Please noteI said follow-up. If thisalbum was put out by a newartist or produced by someonenew it would probally be rated five stars by everyone.So everyone should take a goodlisten to a fairly decent follow up to a hip-hop classic, and realize that Dre is still at the top of his game as far as prodution wise.Lyrically he is'nt good enough to spit versus through a whole CD, he's not a great rapper but an excellent producer. Thats probally why he has so many guest on this CD, and I think its a great way to introduce his new artists. By the way, what hip-hop producer thats out right now can even come close? Timberland is the closest I can think of. But I'm sure there are many producer and artist that would love to collaborate with Dre to this day."
1,"Man, what happened to the West-Side?",I bought this Cd thinking Mr Platinum finally made it back and the old G-days were not totally over. The D-R-E days. This is nothing in comparison to the original Chronic. The man has lost his golden touch. Sad
1,forget about D.R.E.,"thiz cd haz itz upz and downz.therez a lot ov stupid songz on it.therez only maybe 2 good songz on it,still D.R.E. and forgot about dre.sum ov tha beetz are o-kay.so if i were you id forget about D.R.E."
1,Dre defintely ended thanks to this.,"The Once great producer of all time really died with 2pac after he left death row, this album may attract the eminem/50/G-Unit crowd, but he has truly abandoned his true long time fans, most of these songs are completely silly (with the exception of two at a time), the lyrical content is stupidier now, the beats are not that good as it used to be and the the album cover is silly.This is probably the most embarrassingly overrated album of all time.If you want a real dr. dre album go pick up pre aftermath dr. dre stuff.This cd is not for anyone who thinks that a rapper who sues napster for your money.I Rather download then buy this."
1,it sucks,"being a rapper myself, this cd is a piece of crap. if u listen close the lyrics and some of the old westside style beats are not even average. dr dre shouldnt of had so many guests (half of them cant rap). it shoulda just been him, snoop, nate, eminem, knockturnal and hittman. this is one of the worst albums i have ever heard. the lyrics are the weakest parts of the album. its a 1 outta 5. dont buy it. download the 6 good songs out of 23 off of kazaa or somethin."
3,Welll,"It is good and all thaaat. Buuut, nobody comes close to Master P when it comes to hardy core jiggy ghetto g money crazay rhyming. Dre is oookay, but he needs some worrrk, to be the master of this game like Afroman or Jinx Da Juvy.Peace Nizzels!-Steve"
1,Terrible Album,"When I first listened to this CD, it was alright. But when I started overplaying Still D.R.E., I was getting sick of it. I don't like the songs ""What's The Difference?"", ""B_ _ch N_ _gaz"", ""Forgot About Dre"", and ""F_ _ _ You."" The only good song on this album is the one Dre dedicates to his brother. Bottom line is though this CD is not worth buying. If you want to buy good Dr. Dre albums, buy The Chronic and N_ _gaz 4 Life."
3,When is Laura Linney going to win the Oscar?,"An off beat, metaphysical love story that sometimes strains its credabilty in awkward ways. BUT, the performances ave it from being a Lifetime movie or hack romance.Laura Linney is just such an amazing actress. Her face delivers all the lines that are never in the script and you feel whatever she feels. Grace is very good and restrained in his role as the object of her affection."
2,Has potential but runs out of steam half way through,"P.S. has potential. Both Grace and Linney are great in it, but midway through the movie loses its mystic and gets boring. It's a shame because it could've been a great movie. Great acting with a bland plot."
4,Watched This More Than Once,"I was drawn to this movie at the DVD sale table. It is worth the price if you like academic settings, May-December fantasy romances, and great sofa sex. Character development, true, is a problem. It is hard to believe the young artist-student could be so mature/immature all at once. I am now a fan of Laura Linney, she has a pleasing stage presence."
5,Brilliant,"e.e. Cummings famously wrote that poetry is ""the only thing that matters"", but one can not fully appreciate that sentiment until one has read the works of Miss. Ford. Each word is skillfully crafted, like the notes of a great symphony, rising abstractly from the page to form a new methodology of looking in to familiar places. How lucky we are, to be allowed to share her brilliant vision of love and circumstance, pomp and truth. She scribes large, colorful canvases, compressing them to the written page and folds them into paper airplanes that float by. You see them fly, but can never understand how they do. That is the beauty of these elegant poems."
4,Where is the DVD version ????,"I have heard and read some good things about this film, I'll have to add it to my list of ""why isn't there a DVD version"" movies."
3,"Great price, But, NO customer service","If you are really handy with cars and doing electrical work, this remote starter is a great value. I purchased two, one for each car.Pros: Good price, Instructions are good but complex - they need to be, this is not just plug-and play installation.Cons: FORGET about 'service', no such thing. I called their 'support' number on many occasions, not a single time did anyone answer. No answers to email attempts either. (Reason for my call: one of the units has a VERY limited range - about 25', whereas the other is much better, like 75')"
2,Bulldog Remote Start,"I bought 4 of these remote starters last year at Wal Mart for 60 dollars and no shipping fees and they came with everything that was needed, after I received this setup from amazon I found out that I had to order a separate module called a 791 bypass and they cost me another 25 dollars so this ended up costing more money to buy from amazon and another waiting period for the bypass so my advice is go to Wal Mart and buy one"
1,JUNK from a BAD company,"I have had this unit intsalled in my vehicle for 4 years now. I am a mechanic and bought the extra install kit for my pickup to help with installation and ti worked but the range was about 10 feet max. Now it has started to keep my starter engaged and has ruined 2 starters and a battery in my pickup and I cannot get a real person to answer the help line to give any information or warrenty info!!!! They are junk units, spend the extra cash and get a real unit that has a customer service on this planet."
2,neil,"this item need a bypass unless if you drive a 12 year old car, the do it yourself is hard on smarter cars like an minivan, and you will not find an installer who would want to do it without charging you a couple of hundred $$, so do the math"
5,Wonderful!,I love this video! Each muppet adds to the character that they are playing without taking away from the story.
4,a must have. :),"You can't expect this to be another Muppets Christmas Carol or Great Muppet Caper, but it is too much fun! :)"
3,Nothing to write home about but certainly no failure,"The Muppets are still the Muppets. I agree that since Jim Henson died, it seems to take a lot more effort to put together something worthy of their original off the wall charm, but it can and has be done in Muppet Christmas Carol and Muppets Tonight!. Muppet Classic Theater shows us that the focus has shifted to Gonzo and Rizzo since Dave Goelz and Steve Whitmire are among the few Muppeteers still dedicated exclusively to Muppet projects. Granted, these stories are rushed and simplistic and the songs are mediocre, but the work Goelz and Whitmire put in reminds us that these are still the characters we love. It's much like seeing your favorite actors in a bad movie. The story isn't so hot, but you can tell they've still got it and will go onto do better things."
5,Excellent Video for all fans of the Muppets,I first saw this video while I was working as a counselor at summer camp. The antics of the muppets can't be beat. Muppet Classic Theater is an overall crowd pleaser for kids from 3-633! A great buy and a must have for any video collection.
5,Muppets at their best - they can't possibly top this one!,"We purchased this video about three years ago and we have worn it out. My children love it, and they range in age from 1 to 13. Even better, all of the parents, in-laws, grandparents, and baby sitters adore it, too! If they don't re-release it so I can get a better copy, I don't know what I will do. We laugh, we cry (mostly from the laughing), and we remember how special Jim Henson made the muppets and why they remain the best family entertainers around."
5,Moon Over Miami is a Technicolor Musical Delight!,"Moon Over Miami ranks at the top of the list of Betty Grable musicals. This beautiful Technicolor, musical remake of Three Blind Mice stars Betty Grable, Carole Landis, Don Ameche, Robert Cummings, Charlotte Greenwood and Jack Haley. This is the story of three women who pool their resources and head to Florida to find a millionaire husband for one of them. It would be remade again as Three Little Girls In Blue (in Atlantic City) and once again as How To Marry A Millionaire (in New York). Betty Grable's dance with Hermes Pan is amazing and one of the best moments in her long career."
5,"Come on Fox, when are Betty Grable's titles coming to DVD?","Betty Grable, the queen of Technicolor musicals, has not had ANY of her Technicolor musicals released on DVD...all Fox can think of is this Simpsons and X-Files crap. Anyway, this musical, set in a Miami LONG before the MTV kids and their crap hit town, also stars future Cocoon star Don Ameche has some extremely gorgeous Technicolor cinematography. This is one musical you will NOT want to miss!"
4,Cute musical film,Three women who work in a Texas drive-in inherit some money but move to Fl. to find some wealthy men.snappy musical numbers and some twist make this a fun film
4,Great book..wish they would update it!!,"I have read over 15 ""college admission"" books and this one contained several tips that were new. Very easy to read. Only fault is it does push the PR courses and says rather disparaging remarks about other courses, but overall I would recommend it for anyone going through the process."
5,Wild Baby Bird Rescue Stories,This is a wonderful book for adults and children who love birds.The pictures of the baby birds are excellent and the stories about them are easy to read and tell of the wonderful people who care so much for our feathered friends.
4,this seems to be the regular seond album by a. g. & d.,"ashton gardner &v dyke produce a nice, somewhat heavy and sticky fusion-rock. Their sound could be compared to a rawer version of blood sweat and tears (1st and 2nd albums). The whole thing then is freshened up by experimental or pure rock'n'roll interludes (somewhat in a in a soft machine-style). All of the tracks featured on this '70 (?) record were previously unissued. Check out the tracks on the ""ashton, gardner & dyke""-release, it pretty well resumes the sound of this album in a bit lighter way."
2,2 strikes and Yamaha's out.,"I had to return 2 receivers to Best Buy. The first unit I bought had a short somewhere inside, and wouldn't stay on for more than 10 seconds. The replacement unit wouldn't give me any sound from the left side... and I tried both ""A"" and ""B"" left speaker positions. I usually trust Yamaha... but this one is apparently their low end model so if you decide to buy it, make sure you know the store's return policy!"
2,Peter's Lament...,"This book doesn't do much but allow Peter Bogdanovich make himself out to be the victim. It's a shame. Since the story was told from the inside it could have been more insightful, but instead we are invited to wallow in the self-pity of a dirty old man as he airs his grievances against all he think wronged him."
4,Couldn't put this book down,"I remember when Dorothy Stratten died. I also remember the blame Playboy founder Hugh Hefner got for his role in this tragedy and felt it was unfair but now I'm not so sure. This book is riveting and regardless of what you think of Bogdanovich, this book is a tribute to her sad, tragic and too short life."
4,Jane - 'Between Heaven And Hell' (Repertoire),"Originally put out in 1977, this looks to be Jane's sixth album. I've run across several old school fans of German progressive that really like this band, specially this particular lp. Personally, I enjoyed this CD reissue better than their 1972 debut 'Together' effort (see my review). Four tracks total, as with the lengthy title cut ""Between Heaven And Hell"" (19:47) - sort of Floyd-like during much of this number. Then there's ""Twilight"" (8:14) which has a good edge to it - with some rather heavy keyboard work, their sort-of ballad (if you want to call it that) ""Voice In The Wind"" (5:14) and ""Your Circle"" (3:51). I'm only second guessing but 'BH&H' should appeal to some fans of Tangerine Dream, Lucifer's Friend, Eloy and possibly Uriah Heep."
5,tweak your eq if you have one,"I already had Countdown and United, but I bought this so I wouldn't have to buy a complete set of CDs, some (most?) of which have been remastered by now. This box set is remastered, but remastered is probably all I can get now, as is the case with most Metallica CDs. I agree with another review that many of the songs lack low end. I changed the settings on my equalizer to boost the bass, and the songs sound a lot heavier. I still have some changes to make in order for the songs to sound even better, but boosting the bass and treble were a good start. If you don't boost the bass, this collection will sound blander than it should. I don't have a subwoofer yet, but boosting the bass is definitely recommended regardless. With these things in mind, this box set is a must-have for any Megadeth fan."
3,Disc # 1 Problems,"The music is great, but I had a problem with disc 1. If I played the cd in my car cd player it worked perfectly fine, but if I played it on my pc the last 3 songs on the disc would stutter and skip. Has anyone else run into this problem? I also didn't care for the plastic outer sleeve packaging I had problems trying to get the cd's back into it."
3,a whole lot of the same,"Not a lot of new material here. Most of the tracks are available on CDs Megadeth fans will already own. For the few tracks not available before, it seems like a huge outlay of money in trade.The video may be worthwhile, however. Of course, I'm not sure I can take that long with Dave Mustaine's whiny voice. He's better in the studio."
2,Disappointing,"I found the Barron's books on language mostly very good -- I am very fond of the verb conjugation series. This is a rather tame compendium of idioms, many of which seem to be little more than translations of English phrases. There are better products out there such as the McGraw Hill idiom dictionary and the Street Spanish series. I barely crack the cover of this when I am looking to expand my Spanish vocabulary or entertain myself. The McGraw Hill idioms dictionary is the one that I keep by the toilet -- that should tell you a lot."
4,Beer Bellied Pop Punk,I never got into the Larry Arms until I got this cd. The first seven songs fly by and before you know it you're singing every single word.The end of the cd should grow on you later.
1,squeaky,Squeaky beyond belief. Had to remove insoles and replace with DR. Scholls insole pads. Not as loud but not pleasent. Will not buy more Clarks!!
5,An excellent song to make love to...,This single is more than worth it... just for the art cover...and cocoon is one of the best songs to cuddle up next to someone.A great singleoverall.
4,Nice faucet,"This is a nice faucet, but a little bigger than I expected. It was easy to install and works very well. A good compliment to my new granite countertops!"
1,What color? not oil-rubbed bronze,"We are redoing our kitchen. I have ordered oil-rubbed bronze a) lights - two different ceiling lights, b) knobs c) handles and d) light switch/electrical outlet covers. These all matched close enough. The picture looks very dark with light areas but the actual product looks like regular bright bronze. This product does not look like the picture at all. So be careful when ordering if you are trying to go by the term oil-rubbed bronze."
1,Cheap NOT as described!,"I would NOT recommend this item! It was described as brass. Most of it is brass, but the most important part, the nozzle, is cheap plastic. It looks like cheap plastic too. I had to call the company three times for a replacement nozzle right from the start because the underside was cracked and it sprayed all out the sides. Their customer service was hassle free, I will give them that, but I am rating the product. The nozzle does not swivel around either, so you have to pull it out and it is hard to push back in. The ONLY reason I bough this is because it was the only black kitchen faucet I could find, there were a few others, but this was the best looking. What a let down. I really expected more because it was rated so high. If the company replaces the nozzle with a brass one, this would be great! What were they thinking? It ruins the whole faucet! I give it a one star! Sorry Danze, Improve your product!"
3,"not bad, but probably overpriced","Like a previous poster said, it does create quite a bit of spillage... we have to keep a rag by the sink to wipe up after each use to avoid hard water deposits. The hose will still go back in after the pull-down, three years into its usage, but I do have to feed it back in manually (not one-handed). Also, I was dissapointed to find that the head is NOT stainless steel (I discovered after ruining it with a vinegar cleaning to remove hard water deposits).Even worse is that the head is held in place by a plastic piece inside that we've glued back together several times. We are seeking a replacement, but it's been difficult to get their service department on the line.It's nice for getting at large pots, etc., but if we had it to do over, I'd choose something else."
1,Starts out good but ends in too much ego,This volume is nowhere near as good as Morris' other works. It starts out interesting enough but ends with nothing but letters of praise for how wonderful Dr. Morris' students think he is. Morris can do much better than this.
1,Great for home receipts - not a business solution,"For a home receipt solution this would be a great product, but as far as a business solution it requires twice as much data entry then just using quickbooks. It worked fantastic with outlook contacts and the sync was flawless, but of our over 200 vendors not a single invoice could be recognized."
2,Not good,"This didn't work on my Mac, so I called the company for the Mac software. They have it, but wanted to charge me $49 for it. Ridiculous and sad. That being said, if you want a new one that has never been used, I have one!"
2,Gone Glitzy,"My two year old granddaughter has loved the Doodlebops, but in this video they are glitzier and higher budget and she does not like it as well. She really misses Mazz and doesn't like Audio Murphy at all. Really a disappointment."
3,Review Neverwinter Nights- HOTU,good guide however the maps are too small; not enough info about development of characters;
3,One of the worst XMen Stories I've ever read!,"The title pretty much says it. This is one of the worst X-Men story arcs that I have read. O:ZT? It seemed like more of a filler story than anything else. I read (and bought!) almost all of the books that had to deal with this before I read them, and when I finally read them I was monumentally disappointed. I think the only good thing that came out of this story arc was Marrow and Doc Reiss joining the X-teams."
2,Great Remote Starter if you can figure out installation.,"First, if you are not an expert at vehicle wiring, electronics, etc then don't even consider any Bulldog Security product. Their tech support (phone or email) is as bad as it gets. It's like they read one email and put the answer in the next email recieved. I managed to install an RS1300E in a Chevy Truck but only because I had bought the T-Harness adaptor, I had the complete set of factory service manuals for this truck, digital voltmeter to test circuits and expert knowledge on vehicle wiring. The remote starter works well and has excellent range, but some of the other functions do not work as stated or described. Emails and calls to Bulldog result in answers that either do not make sense or seem to answer a different question. Their products however do seem to be good quality but they are just not installable by the average do-it-yourselfer."
1,anti theft,i had instaled the system in november 2006 and by july 2007 it was completely useless it would not respond to the remotes and i could not even reset the system i had to uninstall the whole thing and now my vehicle factory anti-theft system will not shut off and can not start my car it will cost me about $150 for diagnosis to see what the problem is.
1,Do I really want this product in my car?,"I have read several reviews from many websites. Tech support is almost nonexistent at best. With all the hassles described for installation combined with negative feedback from local auto parts stores, I believe it would better to shop for another brand of product."
3,Okay,"Book was not what my teenager expected, but she said it was okay. Definitely would NEVER purchase from wonderbookandvideo again. When there was problem, they operate from a mode of denial that they are slower than other vendors. Additionally, they do not have integrity when it comes to actual dates that they shipped, etc."
3,Nail polish remover,"I change my polish all the time. I also get migraines. I discover that the non-acetone nail polish removers (and 3free) nail polish is the only way I can do my nails without triggering a migraine.This item works better than a cotton ball or cotton pad. It is simple to use, just stick your finger into the sponge and rub until the polish is gone. It even comes with a little metal stick with a tiny sponge ball on the end for you to do your toes.There is only two problems. If you wear dark polish then when you rub it off your nails it might stain your skin up to the knuckle. Which means you better have the normal bottle of non-acetone polish and a cotton ball to clean up your skin. The second problem is the toe nail polish remover. The ball quickly gets stained and takes a bit of work (more than a cotton pad) to clean up the toe nails.All in all I like this better than cleaning my nails the old fashion way. I really love that it is non-acetone."
4,O ano ba kumusta kayo?! This is a nice way to learn!,"This was a wonderful. It is a great way to learn to speak tagalog and unlike other products almost everything I say, my Tagalog speaking friends understand just exactly what I'm talking about. If you buy this book you should Definitely buy a tagalog-english/english-tagalog dictionary because this book was designed for a class room that has a teacher to explain pronunciation and different words. It has a tagalog-english glossary in the back, but if you are like me (still learning) you will be looking back there (in the glossary) at least 4 to 5 times per page that you read and there is only a 50% chance that the word you will be looking for is there. By the end of this book you will have a better understanding of tagalog sentence structure, be able to speak conversationally in a variety of situation (not all situations), and will be impressing your filipino friends and their famlies. O sige, Diyan ka na. Pupunta ako sa aklatan. Paalam"
4,great,This book is a good introduction to Tagalog. The exercises are practical. It is a book that is good on its own but better when used with access to a native speaker.
5,Excellent source of knowledge,"If you want to learn the most common surveying situations you may face out there, this is the book you need to read. Written with a high level of professionalism, the book covers a wide range of topics. I've just finished a course on surveying and definitely it helped me a lot. You will enjoy it if you are a math lover."
4,1001 Solved Surveying Problems,"The book is as advertised. It has a very large variety of solved surveying problems. The problems and their solutions are very thorough and clear. It's a well done book. The biggest downside is there is no index or listing of the types of problems in the book. If you are using this as a reference dring a surveying or professional engineers exam you will have a hard time finding the example problem you are looking for unless you have spent a great deal of time getting familiar with the book or developed your own listing of the problems. It was very helpful in preparing for the 2.5 hour California surveying exam, it was useless during the exam."
3,Story is OK - Main Character Voice is Barney Fife,I like this story even though it suffers from the Left Behind defects.e.g. Prof. Murphy offers his new class his prospectus (for google?); He finds ancient treasures with ease while destroying many others; he knows martial arts but will not do his chores at home (chortle).The worst is the narrator's portrayal of his voice. He sounds like a simpleton - Barney Fife or so.Avoid
5,I haven't finished yet!,"So far, this is a wonderful book. Especially if you have read the Zion Covenent series. Unfortunately, everyone in my family has, and we just got the Zion Chronicles. Needless to say, there's been a little competition. If someone puts the book down and goes to the bathroom or to find something to eat, they come back and it's been stolen! Beware of family when reading a really good book. Those whom you love the dearest and the best can be downright mean when it comes to the next book in a series! I guess there's not much I can say about the book, seeing I haven't gotten a hold of it for very long, but the competition in my family can speak for itself. Buy this book! In fact, buy enough for everyone in your family, or you're in for trouble"
5,good,These are two of my favorite authors. I'm very pleased I could buy this book in their series. The price was right.
5,The Gates of Zion,I am enjoying the book and would recomend any book for these authors. They make history come alive just like you were there when the events were happening.
4,Emotional WWII History,"Who among us has ""Nothing to Regret?"" Very few I would imagine. However, I certainly have nothing to regret for having purchased and read this excellent historical fiction saga of a Japanese family during WWII. As they find themselves inserted into Topaz, one of the consolidation centers, (concentration camps) their life changes dramatically, as does the life of their son who determines, as so many young Japanese American men of that era did, to prove their worth and their loyalty to their American home, even if the country didn't return that trust. Tristi Pinkston is an excellent young writer, with empathy far beyond her years for a long gone era. I recommend this book highly to all who seek a good read.Gordon Ryan"
5,Amazing History Lesson!,I could hardly put this book down. It is an amazingly well-written story and a great history lesson. I didn't realize how much the American Japanese suffered during World War 11. I learned alot about the War that I hadn't known before. It is a fascinating read. I highly recommend the book.
5,Engaging illustrations and perfectly simple text,"My 2 yo loves this book, on the 1 Mouse plans a party page we talk about all the people she will invite to our party and by the end she cheers Happy New Year (in Vietnamese) with me. She was enchanted by Lunar New Year this year, and this book has been a wonderful way to help keep it alive for her. We are not Vietnamese and we love this book."
4,Interesting Premise,"Through invitro-fertilization and a mix-up at the clinic Meredith Malone (white) gives birth to a daughter who is biracial. To get away from it all Meredith accepts a two-week vacation and meets Justin Weber (black) and his two sons. Justin is an attorney who works for the clinic. Both are unaware of each other's connection to the clinic, which leads to the conflict between the two. Meredith's mother has a difficult time accepting her granddaughter's mixed heritage,however Meredith displayed strength in making the decision that she would not have her mother's bigotry impact her daughter. This was a tender and charming novel."
2,Dog loved it - for a day and a half,"I have two criteria for a dog toy: 1) does my dog enjoy it and 2) does it last. This toy satisfied the first criteria, but was in pieces within 36 hours. Is it too much to ask that a dog toy last at least 2 days? Needs to be tied more tightly and/or made of stronger stuff."
3,It's ok,"Not super, but the dog liked it. Price is right, but it's small and fabric feels cheap. The dog liked it."
2,comes up short...literally,"It may be made with 8"" of rope , but with the knots its more like 4 or 5. I bought a rope toy triple the size for $0.65 more at pet food express"
4,Good toy - not for large dogs,"This is a quality dog chew toy, but I was a little disappointed as it isn't what I thought. Yes, it's 8.5"" before being tied, but a little less than 8"" knotted. And it's only about 3/4"" thick. It's a great toy for smaller dogs, but won't last long if you have a large dog that likes to really chew."
2,Warning:This is NOT the same as the PS-2 / X-Box versions,"This games is based on the new Spongebob movie, and the official website advertizes this game as being available on PC, PS-2, X-Box and Gamecube. The trailer for this game shows 3D action like that of Spyro The Dragon, Jakk3 etc.Installing this game on the PC revealed that PC users have been stiffed with a stupid 2D-eqsue ""Monkey Island""-type puzzle solving adventure game operated by soley the mouse.The previous Spongebob Squarepants game ""Battle for Bikini Bottom"" for PC is the same. The PC version of both games are NOTHING REMOTELY like the versions on action games for PS-2, X-Box, Gamecube etc. The website makes no distinction. The official website is totally misleading on this. The trailers for both games show Spongebob and Patrick in 3D action. This is severly not the case for either the PC version.While this game is funny, it's a fizzer. Any kid can complete the game within a few hours, and will never play it again."
1,Difficult!,"My 6-year old son loved Spongebob Battle for Bikini Bottom and had so much fun with it I bought him this one thinking it would be similar. Wrong! This is very frustrating and difficult. Even I was stumped in several places. Unless you want to have a very upset child asking you to figure out every move, don't waste your time or money. Get Battle for Bikini Bottom instead."
1,This is not the same game as the PS2 and XBOX versions!,"Once again, THQ has pulled one on the PC community. The XBOX and PS2 versions of the game are action 3-D games that let you control the characters of Bikini Bottom (Like the Spyro The Dragon games). They are actually fun for the kids to play! The PC version is an adventure game like the old Sierra Online products such as ""King's Quest"" - but with updated graphics and a few mini-games tossed in. The game is very short and has no replay value since the adventure never changes. Why does the publisher do this? All three boxes for the game a very similar - and when your kids play the demo for the PS2 version at the store and see the same box over in the PC section - they grab it thinking it's the same game. Only to be greatly disappointed when they go to play the game at home! Avoid this version of the game!"
1,"Gamecube version :cool, PC version: not cool","When I first saw the box of the Spongebob movie game for PC, I thought it was gamecube, XBOX, and PS2 version. When I bought the game and started to play, I was really dissapointed. The whole game has extremly nothing to do with the real movie. How come in level 3: part 2: Thug Tug, you talk to the thugs. You have to defeat the thugs, not be nice them. In Level 4: Free Mindy. is very stupid. Why was Mindy grounded. Don't waste your money on this crap. Buy the Gamecube version better"
2,Terrible,Horrific song even thought I was born in Februaryof 1985. It was really not that good. At best it was luke warm.
2,"If I had a choice, I would not read this book.","As a beginner in the telecommunications field I was expecting something more simple and understandable.It is full of boring and unnecessary paragraphs, especially the ones in the blue windows.The book is very chatty and verbose.It is wasting my time. I was assigned this book at DeVry for a freshman telecommunications management course.The professor agrees that the book is written in a very complicated language. Every time he quotes the book, he stops to say: ""Now, Let's translate this to English"". If it was my decision, I would not choose this book for my class."
2,Not at all very friendly!,"The book drags, it explains nothing. Its out dated, and very poorly written. Absolutely the worst book I ever had to read. Have sleeping disorders try reading a few pages of this book, it is the perfect sedative."
3,"Some Funny, Some Not",Some of it is funny but some of it is not. I guess that they had to waste all that time with non-funny bloopers.
4,Possibly the Best Almanac Yet,I got this Almanac around Christmas and immediately began to leaf through the book. I especially enjoyed the Millennium edition.
5,Excellent Resource!,This book is very helpful for any student during their homework studies. I currently go to college and bought this for my classes so I can use it for homework. No student should go without this excellent research material!
3,A lot of valuable information.. but!,"The 1024 pages World Almanac 2000 is real bonus. It contains a lot of valuable information.My only criticism is that the Almanac has a real bias towards ""American information"".As it is a ""World Almanac"", the editors should understand that non-American readers would like to see that it has a broader base. I'm sure the editors will rectify this shortfall in the next edition!"
4,it's alright,these work alright but is for a very basic use not for heavy duty use so keep that in mind!
1,Bootleg,"Released by the ripoff artists at AIM Records in Australia without the permission of Cyril Jordan or Roy Loney. Don't support the scumbag bootleggers. Buy a copy of ""Groovies Greatest Grooves"" or Norton's ""Slow Death"" instead."
5,He must be a WONDERFUL Wizard,This 1982 version of The Wizard of oz is very good. The story line is mostley based on the book. I found this movie at a grage sale and bought it for 50 cents. It was well worth it. Me and my brother watched it once and loved it. I think it is one of the greatest Oz cartoons ever made.
5,"Everything can be solved with wisdom, love and courage","I haven't seen this movie for a long time since I got it from the Wherehouse. My little brother and I have watched it and we both loved it. The songs are really great. You'll have them repeating over and over in your head. My favorite one is It's the Wizard of a Day. Also, I liked the messages that each of the forms of the Wizard gave to Dorothy's friends. They're really true."
2,poor quality,This was almost impossible to watch due to poor quality of tape. The ad claimed it was good quality...it was not.
2,LooOOoongest shipping ever.,"Honestly, what the H*** is taking so long?! This thing shipped on the 8th of Feb, its now the 29th and I still haven't got it. It was shipped via domestic standard shipping. The email I got said 4-21 business days shipping?! What are you shipping it via camel? Ridiculous! Still haven't gotten the d*** thing. Never buy from 'Got Books Inc'. Really lousy. I can't even track my shipments. THIS REVIEW DOES NOT MEAN THE PRODUCT IS BAD, ONLY THE SHIPPING WAS A NIGHTMARE! Sorry to lower the rating on this product people, but if this is what I have to go through to get the thing then I can't help myself.By the way, this was supposed to be a Valentines Day present for my Girlfriend. I didn't need it on Valentines Day, so I wasn't to concerned when it hadn't showed up for our celebration, but now its almost March, and I still haven't gotten it. I've ordered things from CHINA that have gotten here quicker. CHINA!!! Ok I'm done."
3,60 ain't so old,"I bought this book to give to a long time friend who was the guest of honor at a surprise birthday party. While it is funny, some of the remarks are a little off-color. Also it is really aimed at men (which the guest of honor was, fortunately.) I don't think women would find the jokes about balding and impotence funny."
2,be careful,"This had alot of sexual humor, which may be embarrassing if given in mixed company. Also, I would recommend this more for a man rather than a woman."
4,birthday quiz book,adds hilarious stories to brighten someone's 60th birthday!! i used this at my friend's 60th birthday party. Everyone had good laugh when i ask questions to the birthday lady!!!
1,garbage,"I am an astronomer and fluent with metaphysics. There is nothing of truth or value (other than the parts borrowed from theosphic literature). A waste of money, time, paper."
3,Decent,"I own the original and had played ""Round 3"" a while back, so I bought ""Round 2"" because it was a bit cheaper. In my opinion, buy ""Round 3."" I think it's a better game."
4,CALIFORNIA DOLLS - WHERE'S THE DVD?,"""All The Marbles"" (or at one point called ""The California Dolls"") is one of our families favorite movies. My brother, can watch this movie over and over and over. I think he knows most of the dialogue. I hope this comes on DVD soon. I have a copy on VHS that I taped off of TV years ago. I did convert it to a DVD format, but still not the greatest quality. Hopefully sometime soon, the studio will release a DVD. Until then, I'll just keep watching my VHS or homemade DVD. Love the end - Double Sunset flip - LOL!!!"
4,California Dolls revisited,"Gee I had trouble finding this film as it was released in the 80's here in Australia under the California Dolls title.I like this movie a lot and Peter Falk gives one of his best performances as a wrestling promoter for women wrestlers, fun film for all ages.Highly recommended."
5,Excellent Text,"Federal Tax Research 6th Ed is an excellent textbook. The 7th Ed is coming out and I would recommend if possible getting it since there clearly are some updates to the federal law that are in order. The text was one of the better books that I have used in graduate school. Indeed it is written FOR graduate students. The text was clear and the exercises were excellent. One caveat: it is imperative to have access to RIA, BNA, Westlaw, CCH, LexisNexis, and others list in the text in order to gain the maximum benefit from the research materials. Otherwise some of the studies in the middle chapters will not be as beneficial. The related online quizzes and PowerPoints were very helpful. My class did not provide answers to the text questions. A major limitation in my studies."
4,"Great Book, Great Deal...Slow Shipping",It was a great deal on the textbook but I had to change the shipping options 3 times to get the book on time. Initial deliery was 6 weeks later and I had to move it up to 2nd day to get it within 2 weeks.
5,Good purchase experience!,The book is in very good condition. The shipping and handling was unbelievable fast. Way to go!
2,So-So,"I was satisfied with the purchase when I first got it. This clock/radio/CD player is slim and looks sophicated. I like how it's compact and not heavy to move around.The CD player works alright, but the sound quality of the radio is pretty poor. No matter how I turn the manual AM/FM tuning dial, I can't seem to turn to the radio station I want. Sometimes, there's a hiss sound, which can be annoying.I didn't have this product long enough to find out how the telephone works, because I'm returning it!"
2,Clock/Radio/Phone Poor Reception,"If you plan to use the radio, do not buy this product! The station does not stay fixed. Wake up to static every morning and have to readjust the station. Continuously changes and has to be readjusted."
2,COBY CD-RA185 Review,The volume control on the handset did not work. Violume was low in all positions. The caller id did not work. The time clock just kept moving and none of the other functions listed in the instructions for the caller id were able to be setup.
3,Problems with Caller ID.,"This phone, clock, and CD player all work beautifully with one minor exception. If you place this on a flat surface (like a table) you MUST place the phone back on the cradle in its exact position or it will not display any caller ID. This gets to be annoying at times as you must go to another phone if you want to find out who is calling."
1,Disappointing Piece of Junk,"I took a chance on this mask for my son. The mask has a powerful polymer smell that makes it unpleasant to use, the plastic clips barely grip the vinyl ridges used to adjust and hold the straps in place, and the plastic clip broke off and was lost during the first use, rendering the mask unusable. Do not waste your money on this mask."
3,Small sacrifices,Very long read. Lots of repetition. Diane Downs was one crazy woman. It was an alright book. Would not read again.
4,May Be Ann's Best,I am a true crime fan and missed this somehow year's ago. The effort she put into researching this book and her ability to transport me to visualize through her writing always amazes me. I wish she could write forever. I think people who read true crime realize more than the average person that you can never never ever really know someone.
3,Could've been better,"Rule could benefit tremendously from a good editor and a good copy editor. She milked some parts of Downs' endless verbosity and didn't explore other parts, like Downs' defense attorney's preparation. She did do a great job of presenting the challenges (budgetary, etc) faced by law enforcement. I think this book could've been a lot stronger had someone gotten real with Rule and told her it needed to be cut down by a third. It just was not as quick a read as the story involved would have indicated."
2,NOT RIGHT,"The book that was sent was the wrong cover for one, and the item was not as described. it said it was in good condition but since i have obtained the book, it has been falling apart and was in poor shape. it had creases, cracks and tears. the pages are falling out and i was very disappointed in this purchase."
5,Couldn't put it down!,This is a very good book. I bought this book even though I have already read it. It's that good!
5,Dark picture of motherhood,"I read this book eleven years ago,while on maternity leave with my third child. It was so haunting. I could feel the pain of those children. This is the best true-crime story I have every read and I am quite a buff in this genre. Ann Rule is fantastic in detail and you feel like you are there. I have read every book by her and wait for the next release."
5,the best book in this genre i have ever read,"I first saw this book after Ann Rule was a guest on a Philly Radio Station. I bought it, and couldnt put it down, was up the entire night reading it! Diane Downs is an engima, she had everything,a family who loved her, but she threw it all away and in doing so, crossed that line that caused her to murder. Ann Rule is a brilliant author, her command of language is the best for true crime writers since Capote, and this remains to this day, her best in my opinion. Its a must read for anyone who wants to study how a mind works.... and doesnt work, in this case. I just wish we had another update in the paper back... its been ten years and I hope the two surviving children as well as all those touched by this tragedy are doing well. AS for Diane... she is truely a modern day Medea."
5,What an investigation!,"The dark allure of this book is to track Ann Rule's portrayal of the narcissitic Diane Downs and to weigh Rule's analysis of her. But, I think there's a better reason to read this book and that is the story of Lane County prosecutor Fred Hugi. He quietly, unwaveringly, and meticulously led the investigation of this murder and was finally able to build a most persuasive case against child murderer Diane Downs. Hardly the aggressive, extroverted pit bull that prosecutors are sometimes thought to be, Hugi is portrayed here as a deeply principled public servant who not only is committed to prosecuting the murderer of Diane Downs' child, but who becomes touchingly attached to the surviving children. While the monstrous deeds of Diane Downs could jade a reader, the integrity of Fred Hugi and the detectives who assisted him will inspire your confidence in the kind of dedicated and upright people who often enter into public service."
5,Best true crime book ever,"This is the book that got me hooked on true crime, and Ann Rule by far is the best true crime author. Diane Downs was a self serving monster who sacrificed her children for her own needs. I have read this book many times over, and am still chilled by the lack of compassion that Diane showed her own children for the sake of a man. I hope she rots in prison."
5,The Sociopathic Woman,"Ann Rule portrays the sociopath like no other author can do.While the book is deeply disturbing, the writing is excellent."
2,unfortunately,I bought this book after seeing the movie. I didn't get very far into the book before I lost interest because the movie has been on so much and is pretty much exactly based on this book.
2,Don't Believe Everything You Read.,"I read this book and yes it is a page turner, and I also watched the movie. This prompted me to do some research into this case and I've come to the conclusion that this woman was wrongfully convicted of a crime she did not commit. I think this author fantasized a great many details in her book. If you do just a little looking into this case you will probably come to my same conclusion. This is not an isolated case, this happens time and again on many levels of our legal system. And the sad thing is, she's still in prison. The author of this book has made a lot of money off this case and it is not even an accurate portrayal of events and the blatant miscarriage of justice. Shame on everyone involved."
4,Fascinating Story..,"The story of Diane Downs is a fascinating true horror story of a mother who cold bloodedly shot her children on the night of May 19, 1983 in Springfield Oklahoma. The shooting took place on a dark lonely stretch of road several minutes from a hospital that could have saved their lives. After the shooting she blamed a ""shaggy hair stranger"" for allegedly attempting to car jack her and then shooting the children. Within minutes of the crime, she was seen driving her car at a snails pace as she drove towards the hospital but it was already too late. One of the children had already passed away as she arrived at the Emergency Room entrance, the others were just barely hanging onto life. This story takes you on a journey of the life of Diane Downs, a woman in love with a man who didn't have room in his own life for her children. In a desperate attempt to keep her man, she had to sacrifice her children.Please rate this review if you found it helpful."
5,The story that just keeps getting better...,"Just when you think you've reached the summit of strangeness,along comes another weird aspect of Ms. Downs' life. This was the first ""true crime"" novel I've ever read. I not only found it entertaining, but also interesting on so many levels.I'm sure many guys have dated women like Dianne who may be pathologically possessive, but thankfully, they don't find pregnancy so fullfilling. I still think there are about six different and valid motives for what occurred (if killing children can be explained).In any case, if you've never read a book like this, go ahead and buy it. Ann Rule's treatment of this chilling crime is like that of an expert journalist. You will be taken into the depths of psychological dysfunction that is exhilerating and in some ways, reassuring."
5,Easily The Best True Story I've Read,"Anne has the way of weaving a story!And what a story this is! Getting inside the head of a mother who ""sacrifices"" her small children to win back the heart of a lover- she has done the impossible.We hate the mother, we understand the mother, we cry for the mother, we despise the mother... Anne Rule has made this murderess so three dimensional. We can somehow understand things we never thought we could with Anne as the teacher.And we are taught without even knowing it. That's a gift, Anne."
5,holds your attention,"i read this before and couldnt put it down. your love the book but hate diane downs. i still remember during the casey anthony trial, how the defense kept saying 'why would a mother kill her child' and i immediately thought of diane downs and susan smith. you will have no doubts who did it and why, with this book."
5,Still haunts me!,"This book is the best written book I have ever read. I believe I think about this story every day. I wonder if Diane Downs has ever felt any remorse for what she did to her children? I have so many questions about this book. Do Christie and Danny, now that they are grown, have any contact with their mother? Do they have any memories of the shootings anymore? Ann Rule did an excellent job at writing this book--I must say her best yet. I feel I was right there and watching Diane Downs whole life due to Ann's writing. A couple of things still disturb me though. Both Steve and Diane Downs came from big families, yet neither side of the family came forth to adopt either child after Diane lost custody. Also did Lew and Nora stay together even after Diane went to prison? Did Lew have any contact with Diane after she went to prison? I hope Christie and Danny were able to put the horror behind them and live a normal life. A must read for any true crime reader!"
5,The best ever,"I read this book years ago, and went hunting for it here at amazon to see if others loved it as much as I did, and was not surprised to see that they did. As far as I am concerned, this is absolutely Rule's finest.Farrah Fawcett did justice to the role on TV, but I can't help wondering if the sociopathic Ms. Downes wasn't flattered by such a gorgeous sexual icon and brilliant actress playing her. I say this because when I saw her interviewed on Oprah I couldn't help but think that she was the epitome of what I think of as an egotist run-amok.Usually, murderers have a very low self-esteem, but she actualy seemed quite pleased with herself. An amazing woman - completely, it seems, without conscience. In any case, the story as Rule tells it is tightly woven and leads you on like a snake charmer. If you haven't read this one, and you like ""true crime,"" you won't be disappointed."
4,"""Hungry Like the Wolf""","This book is an excellent study of the anti-social personality; without a conscience or actual emotion, Diane Downs mercilessly shot her children so that she could have ""a new life"". Even with her oldest daughter - who technically died and was brought back to life - crying on the witness stand, Diane sheds tears only for herself. (The only complaint that I have is of Anne Rule's exagerated descriptions. Diane Downs is described as ""beautiful"" (physically) and ""a knockout"", while her pictures - of an attractive but average woman - do not necessarily agree; also, her intelligence is described as being a step away from genius, though her I.Q. is only 126.) But don't let my complaints stop you; read this book! It will grip you and not let go."
5,Diane Downs is the epitome of evil!,"When I read this book I almost became physically ill when I got to the chapter in which Diane Downs commits the murders of her children. How in the name of God could she have done this to those innocent kids who were like lambs to the slaughter? During the reading of this book I cried many many tears at the thought of those children. Diane Downs didn't deserve the priviledge of being a mother. I often wonder what has become of Diane and how she feels about what she did to her kids? Does she have any remorse? This book upset me so much that I couldn't watch the t.v. movie with Farrah Fawcett. Ann Rule did an excellent job of writing this book, but it would be very difficult for me to read again. This tragic account of a horrible crime, will definitely make you want to hug your own children much tighter."
2,Not great,"Had to return this, it wasn't what I was hoping for. Not great quality and didn't look flattering.The front piece was weird."
3,A Dissenting Viewpoint,"Sorry, but I must offer a dissenting viewpoint among all the praise. Firstly, I thought Turgenev's ""Fathers and Sons"" was outstanding and a great piece of literature. This collection of stories, while very well written and beautifully descriptive, was just not that interesting to me. After reading the first few stories, they seemed to somewhat blend together. I understand the author was illustrating the serf's life and contrasting it to that of the gentry, but I pretty much got that after the first few stories. This is not to be critical of Turgenev--he's a genius--but it just was not my cup of tea."
4,Very simple concept to much biography,"The fireplace design is very simple. However the author spent much of the book lamenting the fact that history has almost forgotten Benjamin Thomas (Count Rumford)yet fondly remembers Benjamin Franklin. The former being a King Henry III loyalist. I don't think history should forget him or his design, I just don't know if this book is the best place to remember Count Rumford. At least not to the degree of detail set in this book. Otherwise it is a short read and informational."
2,"More blueprints, less politics please.","I was looking forward to reading about exactly how to build a Count Rumsford fireplace, long acknowledged to be the most efficient in terms of heat produced and wood used. There were some scattered practical descriptions and a couple of diagrams, but most of the book was an indictment of the 'liberal' politics of Rumsford's contemporaries and today's liberals, that kept the famous Tory - who was a Royalist who went to Britain during the American Revolution - from getting all the credit he deserved for his design. Had he stayed in the Colonies as we became the United States, perhaps he would be well known to Americans today, but he choose otherwise. It was the design I was interested in, and what little information there was, was not sufficient to be able to build the fireplace. I can only hope I meet a mason who is familiar with the historical design and who can duplicate it."
4,The Forgotten Art of Building a Good Fireplace,"The book is a good read and covers the subject pretty well. However, it is short on specific building details and long on sermonizing about how Count Rumford was right over two hundred years ago and everyone since then is wrong. These are still two hundred year old designs and even the most efficient fireplace is still a far cry from a good airtight woodstove. The forgotten art pretty much consists of having a specific shape of firebox, and the configuration of the chimney and smoke throat- all very good and important considerations. But if you are designing and building a fireplace, you won't find what you need here. A good general reference, but go elsewhere for specifics."
5,A must for a fireplace mason.,This book is a classic. Anyone interested in how a fireplace works and heats the occupants of a room must read this book.
2,Not as good as I was expecting with this cast...,"I recently viewed this movie and found it to be far less enjoyable than I had hoped. This was disappointing, as I really like actors Chris Hemsworth and Sean Bean. The story was also set in chicago, and living in the Chicago suburbs, it's always fun to see the local metropolitan area up on the screen. What I was expecting was an action movie with some sort of twist to the end. What I ended up with was a plodding story with a completely unbelievable antagonist. Likewise, the protagonists behave in completely unrealistic ways that just make you roll your eyes and ask ""Seriously?"" I can't figure out how this movie has received so many high review scores. I'd say it is below average in most every way."
3,Not Chris Hamsworth best,"I like Chris so I thought I would really like this movie. I wasn't thrilled. This movie made him look like a wimp. I like him much better in Thor, and the Avengers. I don't think I would recommend this movie."
3,Ca$h,"Not a bad movie to rent for $3, was entertaining would recommend if your looking for a crime/thriller to watch. Not a movie I would go spend $15/$20 for."
2,Disappointing.,While the film is well filmed and the story is decent the three main characters just pissed me off all in their own way. I spent at least an hour of this movie wondering why I kept watching.The ending isn't a let down though so that's nice.Just wanted to post some words so I could leave my 2 star rating and move on.Pick another movie if you want quality - choose this if you have 2 hours to waste.
3,MINIMUM ENGAGEMENT,"A tale with potential that missed the minimum bar by several notches. Sean Bean attempts to play an interesting character but he's too contradictory in his later decision over a small sum of money. Nevertheless, it's a sometimes engaging enough tale of a man mentally dominating and humiliating a husband and wife who have stolen his dirty money. WHEN WATCHED: 10/07/2010 to 10/09/2010; MY GRADE: C plus to B minus."
1,CASH movie,Got this 'cause I love Chris Hemsworth. Well I should have looked at the rating 'cause I didn't expect a lot of cussing in it. It's like every 5 mins. or less! Not many bloody scenes. Glad the ending went well.
1,Not sure,"Ordered this movie thru amazons video on demand,Payed for the HD version ($4.99)got the standard version instead...Half way thru the movie it stopped. This has happened two times before....No more video on demand from amazon."
5,George Lopez,This is a really good movie and I would say this is a family movie that everyone can enjoy! And also the extra's on this DVD was good also you get a chance to see his wife talk and get to see his daughter who was in the movie get a chance to talk as well. This movie will make you laugh and teach kids how to deal with bullies and living with a single parent.
1,Mr. Troop Mom DVD,"I received this movie in horrible condition. So many scratches that the movie pauses & stops at a point in the movie, you can't finish watching the movie. If I had a way to send it back I would and get a refund!! Very unhappy about this purchase."
5,this song is gorgeous....why didn't it get more airplay???,"For those of you lucky enough to hear ""Santo Santo,"" a duet between Gloria Estefan and the Brazilian combo, SPC, you will NOT be disappointed. The sound of this song combines the sensuousness of Brazilian samba, with the flirtatious and warm vocals of Gloria Estefan, who brings her own flavor to this Portuguese song, whose lyrics allude to the orixa faith of Brazil, also prevalent in Estefan's native motherland of Cuba.This is a great introduction to SPC, a band that deserves much more recognition in the United States. Highly reccomended!!!"
4,A compleat manual on salesmanship,"This is by far one of the most compleat salesmanship book I ever read. Helpful, especically those parts on the use of words. It really stands the test of time, as I just found that the first version might have been published by Wiley as early as in 1980. In short, recommended!p.s. Below please find some of my favorite passages for your reference.The words we speak truly define who we are. However, since we are talking all the time, we underestimate the complexity of communication and take the process for granted. pg 1You can think of the customers's personality as being much like the ocean. Without the aid of diving equipment, your view is limited to the surface. pg 273"
4,Wisconsin's Natural Communities,"For almost 30 years I have longed to be capable of ""reading the landscape,"" to comprehend what I see and understand how it came to be where it is today. At this point, I am fluent only in the passages of my own neighborhood, but Randy Hoffman's book offers a good opportunity for me-or you-to learn to read the land beyond the immediate horizon. Hoffman's interpretational guide defines 33 of our state's natural communities by their attendant trees, beetles, fish, lichens, butterflies, reptiles, mammals and flowers. To round out the picture, he superimposes the effects of geology, climate and history on each of these ecosystems. He goes on to profile 50 areas you can visit that are the best examples of our natural communities.My husband and I have used this book as a reference in restoring native plant landscapes. The book also provides lesson plans for teachers. How could you be a landscaper, teacher, or tourist in Wisconsin without this book?"
4,A very sensible and objective survey,"This book analyzes scientific, historical, and political issues associated with homosexuality in a very careful and thoughtful style which does an unusually good job of keeping the author's opinions separate from his factual claims and avoiding any claims that he can't justify.The main drawbacks of the book are that it isn't very exciting and didn't tell me much that seemed new."
3,Okay Item.,These sheets feel good but beware if you don't want to iron. They come out of the dryer extremely wrinkled. Good thing this is for my teenager's room. She doesn't care about wrinkles. Probably wouldn't buy again but okay for my intended use.
4,THEY ARE OKAY,"THEY ARE PRETTY GOOD FOR THE PRICE, I WASHED THEM AND THEY LOOK GOOD, THEY ARE NOT THE BEST QUALITY BUT THEY ARE NOT THAT BAD AS OTHER REVIEWS STATED, NOW IF YOU WANT 1000 THREAD YOU HAVE TO PAY $100 AND OVER."
4,Fit a little snug,"We have these on our queen size mattress, but they are a little snug if you are using a feather topper with your matches. Overall though, they are a good sheet set for the price."
1,JUNK!!,"I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift last year. Well, this Christmas, I asked for some new sheets. These sheets were JUNK! The silkiness was wonderful when we first opened the package. Thought we got a heck of a deal. As time went on, the corners ripped on the fitted sheet. The stitches came out of the flat sheet and the pillow cases. One pillow case got so ripped up that I had to begin to use it to clean with. I can tell you that the sateen helps clean mirrors and windows really well. I think I paid a pretty price just to use this item as a window cleaner. Buyer BEWARE!"
2,Below Average performance for Michael,"His first album was far better than this one. The songs on this album were too simplistic, it didn't challenge is vocal range, depth and talent.If you haven't heard his first album, you would like this one."
5,Fantastic Michael,He has grown and taken his voice along for the ride. A wonderful CD and a must have for any Micheal Jr. fan
2,The more mature Michael Jr.,"Just received Musica E La Vita and played it for the first time.Dissapointed-maybe some. His ""Dreamland"" CD brought tears to my eyes with the beauty and strength of his singing almost every time I listened to it. The song ""Anna Maria"" in the new CD was sung like so many of the songs on Dreamland, with feeling and volume. I know his voice has changed and certainly to be expected. As he gets more mature I feel his voice will improve to the degree, I feel, like it was in his early years. In the meantime I will keep listening to Dreamland."
3,great pictures and quotes,"Memories of Duke is a great book to find out about Duke Kahanamoku. In this book there are many pictures of Duke from his first swim at Alakea Slip in 1911 to his death in 1968. The book is broken very nicely into five sections. Each section represents a different aspect of his life. For instance, one chapter on swimming, surfing, ambassador, etc. This book is filled with quotes from people who knew Duke or Newspaper articles. This book is just an organization of Duke's life. I think that it could have been better if the authors added more of their views instead of everybody elses. Other wise this book is a great book to own."
5,Works great,"The light works great, great color index and it has lasted for over a year, it has dimmed a bit but my plants in my fish tank are still growing strong."
4,Just lovely,"While it is true that on this CD Sandoval, in tribute to many trumpet masters plays each tune as its original hornist would have, that does not take away from the lush beauty of this disc. Each track from Concerto for Cootie to My Funny Valentine just brings to mind images of big bands, great concert halls and wonderful parties and nights on the town.If this doesn't put a smile on your face and make you want to make yourself a nice Manhattan, then there's something wrong. Is the the most inovative Jazz CD around? No, but it is a wonderfully entertaining tribute by a Trumpet great."
5,Happy Dixieland to you !,I will repeat my review on other Sandoval album:I always smile when I listen to Arturo Sandoval. His technique is absolutely unbeatable. And he also plays piano with great dexterity!Here is my mathematical relationship to describe Sandoval's technique:(Arturo Sandoval / Trumpet) = (Oscar Peterson / Piano)Phenomenal.
2,Two questions,"Why listen to this CD when you can listen to the original trumpet players' renditions of these tunes? Then, ask yourself, which do you like better, the originals or Arturo's mimics?"
2,No One Man Can Do Justice To All,"Trumpet players Beware!!!There is absolutely nothing new on this CD. At best, it is the attempt of one player to try and mimic the best in other great players, perhaps in an effort to show that he is the best of all and can do everything.No one can. And anyone who has played a trumpet knows this.Mr. Sandoval is talented indeed, but he is no Louis Armstrong, Harry James, Maynard Ferguson or Rafeal Mendez...especially all rolled into one.For my money he should stick to what he did on his big band CD. That is a CD worth listening to again and again!!! Of course, in this case, Arturo played all the solos and 1st and 2nd chair. Is anyone good enough to play with him, does he have a problem sharing the spotlight, or is it just bad management?Get back to your roots Arturo so we can all begin to enjoy your fabulous trumpet playing again!!!I'd have rather bought a half decent bottle of wine and listened to an old Maynard album than this garbage."
5,album title says it all,"I was reading some reviews about this album, and somebody asked the question, why?. Well, I think Arturo not only wanted to pay tributes to legendary trumpeters, (who inspired him to be who he is and play like he plays,) he wanted to show the world how beautiful the trumpet sound and styles have been this last century. It was his idea, no other trumpeter could have come close to what he's done, and he deserves all the credit in the world. The album is filled with some of the greatest titles ever to represent the jazz world and solo trumpet. I highly recommend this CD and satisfaction is guaranteed. Arturo truly is an important link to the evolution of trumpet."
2,Please!,"There is a phrase: ""Jack of all trades but master of none."" That is appropriate for this farce."
1,the only question is - why?,"This isn't jazz. It's the exact opposite of jazz.Jazz is, or was, about creativity and originality - not just transcribing great jazz tracks note-for-note and re-recording them with better audio quality."
1,Arturo=Crap,"There is not a hint of originality on this CD whatsoever. Arturo may be a master technician on the trumpet but his musicianship is nonexistent and his musical interpretations are downright WRONG. I can actually picture Artro's thought process when he was deciding to make this CD:""I want money""""But I am lazy""""Good albums require lots of work""""How about instead I make a crappy album and sell it to chumps""My advice: Don't be a chumpa and DONT buy this album!!"
1,This lamp is an ugly piece of junk - and probably will arrive broken,"I bought one of these and thought it was a neat idea. When it arrived and I plugged it in, it started to scream!! I called Verilux and they said that a lot of them came from the factory that way -- they didn't stop selling them, they just shipped replacements when the bad ones turned up. Don't take a chance with this garbage."
4,Excellent Customer Service - Nice Design,"I like the design & function of this lamp, though I did have problems with the lamp initially. Verilux sent me a replacement lamp in the mail and then sent me a shipping label to return the old lamp. Now that is customer service! Happy sleeping and waking!"
3,Nice light,"I really like the light portion of this product, went to sleep and awoke gently using just the light. The sound leaves a lot to be desired. If I try to use the lower volume, there is a terrible screeching sound that does not go away no matter how far down I lower the volume. By taping cotton and cardboard over the speaker, I am able to lower the nature sounds to a tolerable level. Of course, I lose sound quality and I finally simply turned the sound completely off. But the gentle waking to gradual light is lovely."
2,Great While It worked,"I've owned this for 4 months and loved it until last week. The only thing working on it is the radio and I've only used the radio once in the past! Well, the radio doesn't actually work - it's on. And won't shut off without unplugging it. The light doesn't work, the clock doesn't work, and none of the buttons respond. Thoroughly disgusted with this."
4,Makes all the difference,"I've had two sunrise-type alarms before this one and this is the best of the three. The adjustable time to wake/sleep, on-board radio, and natural sounds were selling points. I especially like the sleep setting. As a person who wakes up in the dark at least five days out of seven, this is a life saver.One negative: previous sunrise lamps had a sound alarm that played at the end of the light fade-in. This lamp would have been a five-star with that feature. Thankfully, my PDA functions nicely in that capacity."
2,Great idea lacks quality,"I purchased this item on special for $49.95 and was excited to get it. I went home and tried it and immediately, the lamp would not come on. After trying several bulbs and on both AC and battery power, the light would not come on after I pushed the button several times. Everything else seemed to work fine until I tried to shut the alarm off. The wake button jammed and would only stay in alarm mode.I think this could be an awesome idea if the company would just invest a little more in quality and caring about their consumers."
2,Not impressed,"Like the idea, but in reality doesn't work so great for me.Pros: Like the nightlight color effect on the clock. Reallly does help me fall asleep a bit quicker. You can set the light to turn down gradually at night along with music, sound effects, etc.. Nice selection of sound effects.Cons: Light way too dim on highest setting, therefore doesn't get bright enough to make a ""nice sunny day"" re-enactment. That's my biggest complaint, just not bright enough. Bulbs are expensive. After the first week of waking up to the birds, I wanted to kill birds. The sound gets very annoying after awhile. Way too expensive. Very bulky. Cheap ugly plastic shade.In the end, just not worth the money. Maybe for 50 bucks I'd give it 3 stars."
2,So disappointed!,"I also live the the Seattle Area, and winters are dark and rainy for months on end. Your body loses it's day/night clock. This lamp worked great, for about eight months, then the alarm broke. Now, all I get is a horrible screech in the morning. So, that comes to 20 dollers per month to use it for it's lifetime...:(. I'm looking around for something that is a better value."
2,Not too happy with defunct product,Like the fading in of light. Would like the sound effects...if they worked! Out of box the sound effects did not work. Now have to mess with calling the manufacturer to fix or get it replace. Such a hassle.
3,They kicked this one out the door...,"The quality of the printed text in this book is very poor. It looks like they photocopied one of the old copies and bound it. Text is very grainy and sometimes changes size from chapter to chapter.The actual content is fine, although a bit dated. Some of the scenarios they portray are very definitely from the 70's. It could use a refresh, but the ideas and exercises are solid."
1,Wrong book inside correct cover,"Received this book and found the inside to contain a book on diet and nutrition. Based on my understanding of the description, the contents would have covered Assertiveness training for women. Stange!"
2,Spectrum Light Therapy,"I used the Blue Spectrum Light Therapy Device during the times I was living in a cave in France. I thought it would help nourish my skin and provide my eyes with much needed Light sensation but all I got was a horrible headache and pain in my eyes. For days I couldn't see very well and had to sleep it off.Also, some of the food (I was eating hermit crabs) I ate reacted vigorously against the Blue Spectrum Light which caused me to get huge patches of rashes."
1,Poor customer service and false product description for the Philips Health Golight M@2,"We recently purchased this product for our daughter that lives in another part of the state. After it arrived she was dismayed to learn that because we purchased the GoLite M2 vice the P2, it is an international version and does not have a US adaptor. no mention was made in the product descirption that it would not work in the US. We called customer service and they said it was our fault for not ordering the right product They would not send out an adaptor and said we had to return it at our own cost for a refund. This goes beyond customer ""no service"" and cost us 20 dollars for not even experiencing the benefit of the product, If you still read the product description of the M2 you are not told it does not function in the US, Amazon has lost a customer for its false advertising and lack of service that cost us money. Yes we are upset with the service."
5,It worked for me - I can sleep again!,I bought this with hopes that it would help me get my internal clock back on track. For the past year I haven't gotten more than a few hours of sleep a night. I would still be wide awake at 2am and have to start my day at 6am. After using this for a week I was literally unable to stay awake past 11:00. I can't believe how much better I am feeling now! I use the light for 15 minutes a day and it has exceeded my expectations. I am happy that I purchased it.
4,philips health golite M2 The light that helps,"I have moved to ME recently and felt really effected by the lack of sunlight available. I started using the Go Light as soon as I received it, I can honestly say it has helped with my mood and energy level. I do feel however the unit needs to be charged more often than stated. After one or two uses I need to recharge unit. I followed instructions to fully charge unit for 8hours when I received the Go Lite. I would recommend this to anyone who feels the effect of SAD. I have let my friends try the unit as well. My kids 16 and 21 refuse to try it."
5,this has changed my life,I have had insomnia for my whole life- using this and keeping a regular sleep schedule has changed my life- I have more energy and can now wake up early (and even go to the gym). I no longer have to use sleeping medication.
4,Kinda Noisy...weird,"I ordered this thru Amazon at the urging of my pdoc...he said it would help with SAD which happens like clockwork at this time of year to me.Got the device home, charged it and turned it on...it has a very loud hum to it while in use and an even louder hum while charging.If you are new to these devices as I am hopefully the benefits will outweigh the humming noise.Good luck."
2,Quit Working,"I've only used this lite a handful of times, when I needed it. I've had it for about 2-1/2 years and when I went to use it the other day I found out it only works when it's plugged in. The display shows that the battery was charging, and then it was fully charged, but nothing I do seems to be able to get it to work on battery power. If I have it plugged in, it works fine. But this defeats the ""portability"" which is the reason why I chose it over other models.I do think it helps me with SAD, although it's hard to tell if this is due to a placebo effect. I only regret the purchase because it stopped working on batteries. Very disappointing to say the least."
4,Philips Health GoLite M2 Blue Spectrum Light Therapy Device.,"It is smaller than I expected, which is great. I got this model because it has an alarm that starts the light at the set alarm time & it is battery operated. I wish I had known it has to be plugged in to start the light with the alarm."
1,"Amazon shipped opened products, light gave me headaches","I purchased this product hoping that it would help me with my up and down energy levels. When I received the product, the plastic bubble wrap the unit was in had been previously opened. As an earlier reviewer had said, when I plugged it in, the unit would make a high pitched noise which also occurred when the display light was on.I sent it back for a replacement and the second unit was also used before. The packaging was opened, battery already partially charged, and it too made a high pitched sound when plugged in. In desperation, I tried the unit a couple of times before returning for a replacement and the light ended up giving me headaches that lasted several hours. Instead of asking for a replacement, I asked for a refund. It had been used already, didn't work to improve my energy, and made my problems worse."
2,"It broke, I'm crushed","This great light helped me so much. I have always depressed in fall and early winter, til about Feb. I never thought about it until I visited a relative several times in LA and everytime I was there, my mood lifted INSTANTLY--ie the second I got off the plane, in the sun.Someone suggested I have SAD and told me to purchase a sunlight. I did. This one. It lifted my mood when I used it--30 minutes a day. It was a miracle. I took it with me everywhere when I had no time for it. I used it in the car, at work etc. It was fantastic.Until about 6 weeks after I got it, it broke. The light won't go on. I will be grousing to amazon and Philips tomorrow, at the beginning of a week. Stay tuned."
5,EXCELLENT,"Not only was the customer service ie: quick delivery excellent the product is EXCELLENT. Highly effective in treating S.A.D. The functional components are versatile and the ability to set the light to come on with the alarm and also set at timer is great. The chimes alarm has to be the most pleasant alarm ever created, it is effective in waking up me WITHOUT the urge to smash the alarm clock because the buzzer is annoying and startling.The light level is adjustable and the tilting panel enables the user to find just the right position and setting to be enjoyable instead of irritating.In using the product for less than one week, my sleep cycles stabilized and my mood elevated. Pricey? Yes but the product and my level of wellness are worth it.D. R., RN"
3,Go Lite M2,This device is portable and easy to use. The soft touch buttons do not always work which requires repeat pushing to activate functions. That is a frustration. Other than that the shipping was good product performs as stated.
3,somewhat disappointed,"I had researched a number of light therapies and while this appears to be good the paperwork that came with it is a little sparse and it does not have features that the ads lead you to believe it has. It appeared to me that it had an alarm clock that could turn it on in the early morning automatically rught before you wake up as some therapies do. Actually it has an alarm to remind you to turn it on. It is virtually identical to the one at Costco, and even at $100 off it was still more. The Costco one is billed as a travel version, this appears no different."
2,LOTS OF PISTACHIOS,"The book is a bit incoherent, since it jumps around eras. But it gives a lot of interesting detail. It was good to learn one good feature on Neolithic living, lots of pistachios."
4,Great Mechanical Pencil with few shortcomings,"I've been using the Mont Blanc fountain pen and mechanical pencil for over 20+ years, initially with the Classic and later Meisterstuck Chopin. I liked both the fountain pen and pencil.While the first reviewer complained about breakage, I've had none except losing two. The only complaint, albeit minor is having to push the lead back inside the opening. Otherwise a very good pen."
2,Informative... But intellectually useless.,"This book is actually a direct translation of a major comparative study by the late shi`i scholar Muhammad Jowwad Maghniyyah. The original work as well as the translation simply list religious rules regarding certain cases and highlights the differences between the Sunni and shi`i scholars.The work rarely mention the reasoning behind any legal rule and the information is very brief. For practicing Muslims, the book can be a great source of information; for non-practicing Muslims, it is useless.The translation is not the best I have seen either, I have read better translations of the same work and this one is the worst.For the kind of information that is contained in the book, any online resource of Islamic law (of the same calible) will be more useful and save more time."
2,Meh.,"This book was recommended to me. While the book itself was well written, the content seemed to be lacking. We have a special needs child who does not have a great prognosis (mitochondrial disease), for me, I felt that this book didn't address us parents who live in fear of outliving their children well enough."
3,"I'm not really into maxi-singles, but.....","....for the club heads and DJs, this is something good to pick up. My fave mixes are the HiNrg Radio Edit (track 8) and HiNrg club mix (track 2). Both are very trancy, and have elements of europop and of course rock that's on the original version. The House Deluxe mix is pretty good too. All mixes (except one by Mike Cruz) are totally produced by Wolfram Dettki (Amber's producer for the album My Kind of World)...no Thunderpuss or CLub 69 needed here. Wolfram did a pretty good job without hiring expensive remixers.By the way, you get 8 different mixes of You Move Me with this one. If you want a signed copy and don't want to pay shipping, buy this off her website instead (www.amber-mcc.com) and visit her Boutique.I would have ranked this a 5 but like I said I'm not into maxi-singles and like a little variety like in a regular album, but still, it's a good collectible (esp. a signed one!) Get it today."
1,SHAME ON AMBER!!!!,"Amber,born may 9 1969,is a dance/pop singer originally from the Netherlands who has had little chart success. Previous remixes of her singles have been regularly played in clubs. Though she has had only a few released single, this has to be the worst song of hers yet. Oddly enough, this single is only a trick to make her new album appear that it has dancy tracks. Her new full album is actually Easy Listening/Pop at it's worst. Apparently Amber had a falling out with her old record label and couldnt get a contract through any others. This is actually put out on Amber's own new label. She could have done better and she will most likely never rock the dancefloor again."
1,Field of Valor,"While I have not yet read the book, I wish to point out that Glenn Davis never reached the rank of brigadier general. As a matter of fact, he hardly reached the rank of first lieutenant. He was too interested in Hollywood and such environs. He wasn't even a good pro player. Neither was Joe Bellino."
4,refused,tried to get the whole series bought up in a 8 week period a LOT of problems so they ALL were refused or returned.To short a time period to get the whole set bought during this time to much errors in shipment and have to reorder this one was a very slow order and and if it came to me it was refused unopened due to not having all items.Not a thing to say 32-43 books i 8 weeks is imposable to receive a complete series due to all different problems and thus I saw it better to stop buying items. may try again time perments.
5,Very insightful.,A fine book to read and reflect upon. The buzzards were circling then. The buzzards are circling now. The question posed for the 21st Century reader is what are we going to do now?
5,Incredible emotional intensity. I couldn't put it down!,"An amazing story of an incredible scientific experiment. I experienced all the range of emotions:fear, anger, joy, hope, wonder, and more. Setlowe does an amazing job of filling out the characters' personalities and making them seem unbelievably real. I highly recommend this work!"
5,Sweet Songcrafting,"When I found his CD in a Pittsburgh record store I picked it up, and I haven't set it down since. It goes everywhere with me, and I play it for everyone I know. I sent a copy to friends in Germany and Kosovo, and now they're crazy about it too. These songs are so honest and honey-thick with emotion that you're tempted to discard them as sappy, but then you find yourself humming the melodies and singing the words to every track on the album, and just like that- you're hooked. You've all heard music that was just ""O.K."" Dave has courageously poured his soul into this music, and the benefit is a consuming, honest, and emotionally-charged album that's solid from beginning to end. I can't wait to see what he comes with next!"
5,Awsome Singer!!!,I just heard him sing live tonight at a college in PA. You can tell that he sings from his heart. His words make you smile and it makes you feel like you been there too... you get lost in what he is saying. i'm listen to this track as i write this. i hope to see him agian live. It was Awsome!!! i wish him lucky with this career. He will go far!!
1,do not buy this,"First, when I started using it for my baths in my tub, it didn't work at all. It leaks water in and it is too tight when worn.It's a toy. Refund policy was terrible. I basically wasted money. Looks very neat however, and possibly could be used for halloween occasions or some other creative reason. Maybe you can reuse the components for an engineering project, or use it for eye protection, or convert it into special sunglasses?"
1,A Frustrating Way to Study for the GED,"This workbook is frustrating at best for GED preparation. This is because for many of the book's practice questions, the paragraph that preceeds the multiple choice answers simply does not contain the information needed to arrive at an answer. This is NOT the case on the actual GED Science exam, which is structured to require you to use such scientific method skills as observation, forming hypotheses, deductive and inductive reasoning, etc. On the actual exam, unlike this workbook, properly applying these skills to the information given is sufficient arrive at the correct answer."
1,Ask before you buy,I bought this game for my son. I tried to put it on his laptop. Toshiba P4 with Nvidia card. It would not load properly and did not work. Went to THQ for answers and after days of Email all I got was that I needed to update my display driver. Only problem is that there is none. Tried it on my Centrino laptop and it would not even load. There are major compatibilty issues with this game. Support is poor.
1,Won't install... don't buy!,"As you can see from the other reviews, there is a major problem with the installation of this game. The installation program takes five minutes to load the first screen which makes you believe that it isn't working at all. Even after you supposedly install the game, the graphics are all messed up and the game generates page faults all over the place.I very large stinking pile of crap! Do NOT buy this game. You have been warned. At the time of this writing 75% of the reviewers couldn't install the game and get it to work."
5,Top 3,"One of the top three Naz albums. Hair of the Dog is #4, BTW. Anyone that remembers the Cold War will connect a little better to these songs. Dan SWEARS it wasn't a concept album, it just worked out that way."
5,Very helpful to artists wanting to sell their works.,"This how-to guide is wonderful for artists who are just breaking into the business. The author uses a friendly, personal voice, and shares her own experiences very frankly.It is a shame that artists also have to be salesmen and pitch their own work in today's competitive world, but Hadden demystifies the process and makes it seem do-able.I mean, someone like Frank Stella who has a gallery and is shown in museums doesn't need The Artist's Guide to New Markets, but struggling artists with day-jobs will learn a lot from this book. Hadden takes the fear out of the awesome task of being your own best promoter."
3,Not what I expected...,"Being a big fan of Soulstice, and many of OM's other groups and artists, and of vocalists like Gina Rene and Omega, and of soulful deep house in general, I was really looking forward to Andy Caldwell's album... I really hyped myself up for it, which might be why I was so disappointed by it, since I was expecting so much more, and something so much different.""Universal Truth"" in my view is too commerical sounding, too over produced, and too... ""poppy"". Nice enough to listen to, but not memorable to remember. It is not a bad album per say, but if you are expecting something in the calibur of Soulstice's works, something deep soulful and funky - if you are looking for some decent deep house, look elsewhere. This is commerical pop/dance, pure and simple."
2,Poor audio quality,"I probably should have known that this wouldn't be like the great CCLPA material from the 1970s, but I bought it anyway."
2,Very Poor writing...,"I really did not care for Jurgen's Superman stories, his writing on Thor is not much better. Here he builds the story all the way up to what is supposed to be an explosive climax, and it falls flat in the last ten pages of the story. I really miss the days when Walt Simonson worked on Thor. He treated Thor like a mythological character. Something the current writer does not do."
3,An Attempt to Recapture the 60's. So-So Results.,"It is clear to this reviewer that Dan Jurgens has attempted to revisit the earliest roots of Thor, journeying back into mystery and attempting to revive the grand and epic tales that Jack Kirby with an assist from Stan Lee wrought during Marvel's heyday. Does he succeed? Well, almost but not quite. There is an honest attempt to recall the glory that was Asgard, but ultimately it falls just short and reminds the reader of how far the mighty have fallen. Still, by attempting to recreate the essence and persona that Jack Kirby instilled into the Thor mythos and not merely rehashng the hackneyed plots that have permeated this title for the past 30 years - the story remains a worthwhile if vaguely unsatisfying effort. The art similarly tries to recapture the techno-style of Jack Kirby and manages to compliment rather than distract from the story, but it won't fool you into thinking that the King has returned to pencil the book."
2,Not so great a graphic novel.,"I have noticed before that Marvel doesn't do a very good job with writing fantasy-oriented comics, except maybe for the Dr.Strange mythos. They just seem to be much better suited at writing sci-fi oriented stuff such as the X-Men, SpiderMan, Daredevil, Punisher, Wolverine, Deadpool, Nick Fury, you know the drill. So when I picked up this Thor graphic novel (which is the first Thor story I have read by the way) I didn't know what to expect. And lo and behold, I was disappointed.You see, in fantasy novels and ancient Norse myth, Thor was always portrayed as a relentless, mighty, rough, and sometimes vicious warrior-god, kind of similar to Conan from Robert E. Howard's Conan fantasy novels.But, sadly, in this Thor graphic novel, he is portrayed almost as a cheap ripoff of Superman. And I was very shocked at this, because this book was written by one of the best writers in the Superman mythos, Dan Jurgens. So, as you can tell, I was very dissapointed in this Thor title."
4,Saving My Seats,"PROSThick materialFits well into seats (Subaru Legacy)Plastic Handles to shove inbetween the seats keeps it in place most of the timeQuick InstallCan be folded up and takes up almost no space in the trunkCONSThe material although thick does seem to wear kind of quickMy dog (bulldog) doesn't slide bad on it but she definitely isn't as stable as in the seats normallyEvery once in a while my dog loses it a little (probably because of my driving) and can flip it over on one side. I think with some better driving and more time with her getting used to it, this won't be an issue but it can happen."
4,Waterproof Hammock Seat Cover for Pets,"My only suggestion would be that the straps which are used to hook the hammock to the head rests be made of a non-tearing material or a more reinforced material. With the dog always getting in and out, there is significant pressure put on those connecting straps which has caused the two rear ones to rip.Otherwise the product has been great."
1,Beware. Bait and Switch.,"My email to Solvit. Never received a reply.""On October 16, 2010, I bought the Solvit 62283 Deluxe Bench Seat Cover for Pets.It was fantastic. Exceptionally well made. Looks great, fits great.On May 30, 2011, I bought another. Exactly the same product. Same model number. Same page on Amazon.This one is junk. Thin material, poorly constructed, feels cheap. I hate it.Both from Amazon. Both from the same product page.So my question. What happened in the space of one year?Here's what I think. I think you created an excellent product, collected the 5-star Amazon reviews, then switched to a cheaper manufacturer to save money.Am I wrong?"""
2,Not very sturdy,We have had an old hammock seat cover by same company for a couple of years. The new one is of a much flimiser material and the hardware clipping it to the headrests broke after only 2 weeks of use.
2,Great concept. Cheap materials.,"I have had this cover for a little over 4 months and while it started out great, the material they use to wrap around the headrests has (for lack of a better word) dry rotted. I don't know if it was caused by the sun or the heat, but when installing it yesterday, the material just came apart. At first I though it had just come out of the slides, but upon inspecting it, the material is rotten. I can literally tear it apart with my fingers very easily. Great way to ruin a good product.I would have gladly paid an extra 5-10 dollars for this if they had chosen to use some high quality UVA proof nylon webbing, instead of this disgrace of materail they used. Plain string would have been a better choice.Only giving two stars because of the concept and rest of materials seem to be okay, but time will tell. I guess I will have to jury rig some new headrest straps. Maybe some alligator clips or something?"
4,Solvit Waterproof Hammock Seat Cover,"This held up to a big labrador for several years. He did chew the toy pockets off, though. But the seat stayed nice and dry and clean."
2,Solvit waterproof hammock,I purchased this about a year ago and I have 2 labs and they love it. The problem is when it needs a washing the waterproof vinyl backing is falling apart. I had to wash it three times and now I have to throw it out because its no longer waterproof and the seat gets wet. The other problem is the brass grommet holes that hold the straps around the head rests are ripping out and tearing the fabric. I think it should be reinforced better for a larger dog..
3,"Does the job, but...","This is a good product, it does a decent job of protecting the bench and seat back from ..well what dogs do. My complaint is this: After 1 summer installed in the back seat of my car, the straps that had been sun exposed literally crumbled. The seat cover is useless with no way to fasten it to the headrests. Not sure what to do now, the dogs love to GO!"
1,Not waterproof,"Water and mud flows right through the slits for seat belts, junk! Later it rips out at those same slits!"
3,Keeps seats clean but . . . !,I have several different kinds of covers for my backseat. I was hoping this one would keep my German Shepherd from wanting to stand between the seats but no chance of that! She just stepped over it. It is waterproof so it keeps the seats clean but the material is noisy as she moves back and forth across the seat. It sounds like she is tangled up and is very distracting to me. Her hair sticks to it which is hard to remove. Maybe that's the idea so it doesn't blow around the car but I'm not thrilled with my purchase. I like the adjustable straps on the headrests which is easy to remove but I think someone needs to make the same product out of a washable sheet so it's softer and not noisy. My dog cannot get to her water bowl on the floor with this connected to the front headrests. I am going to try to let the bottom rest on the floor and see how that works since it is so long.
3,hammock review,"about a month now, and the item is holding together well. my bulldog slobbers like a waterfall and both dogs are frequently tossed in the back while still wet from swimming; so far, the waterproof feature has protected my seats. thumbs up!owing to the way the hammock is attached and its width, it moves quite a bit and exposes the seating at the ends(near the doors). this allows the dogs paws to contact the seating here. not good.the straps have not broken nor loosened and the fabric is intact; that's with two dogs on it: 85lbs and 55lbs.overall, it's a very good product for the price. the only points taken off are for the size and fit. this could be remedied with a custom seat cover if you're willing to pay 5-6 times more!recommended (ps- i'm a tough customer!)"
3,"Good product, poor support straps","This hammock worked really well for a while. I used it consistently for a year. It washed well with no smell that others mentioned. After being stored for about 6 months, the straps tore the moment weight was put on them. It was stored in the car under the same conditions it was used previously. 3 of the straps tore straight through and the snap hooks came off the other one. Would have been great if the straps weren't so crappy."
1,Straps ripped almost immediately. Very shoddy material.,"I bought this item on the strength of the recommendations here, and I'm sorry to say that either people never actually used the product for very long before posting reviews, or I got a defective item: The straps on both sides in the back practically disintegrated after about a week of use. We tried to rig some sort of alternate straps with the leftover pieces, but those pieces ripped while we were trying to tie them. Very, very disappointed."
4,waterproof Dog Hammock,I would recomend this product to my friends. The ONLY thing I found wrong with this product is it's kind of slippery for my dog when she gets on it so we put a blanket ontop of it. To have her in the back seat and NOT have to worry about her falling off if we were to suddenly stop is worth every penny we spent. I will buy more for the other cars also!
3,Eh.,"Do not buy this if you have a two door car and backseats that do not have headrests. There was absolutely no ""toxic smell"" like other reviewers mentioned. It is way too big for my 2006 Infiniti G35 and not having headrests makes it useless. It's just too big. I'm sure the actual product works fine but you have to have the right size vehicle. My dog cannot jump into the backseat because it is a two door car and especially not with this thing in there...I'm sure she was thinking ""how the heck am I supposed to get in there mom?"" My mistake for not taking more time to measure and check to see if I had headrests. No complaints about the product besides the slits for the seatbelts...not sure why someone would want to sit on a dog car cover..so why do you need seatbelt slits? That just makes it possible for dog hair to get in your seats..."
4,does the job,Ordered this product because my dog wouldn't settle in the car and I thought the hammock might keep her contained. It fits in the car well and does a good job of protecting the seat from dirt etc. Easy to use and stays put better than a regular blanket.My only complaint is that the hammock won't come up high enough in my 2004 Honda Civic to keep the dog in the back. Our dog easily stepped over the edge and stood with her front paws on the center console. This might not have been the best product for our needs but it still works well as a waterproof cover to the back seat.
5,Best way to travel with my dog.,Best way to travel with my dog! I don't have to worry about my wet and dirty lab jumping into my car. Holds perfectly in place and sets in seconds.
3,Just 'OK',"The cons: The slide that makes the strap adjustable is very wimpy, and broke on two of the straps. It did NOTHING to discourage either of my dogs from hopping into the front seat. It's not all that waterproof, as evidenced by my puppy's urine leaking through to the seats upholstery.The pros: It did an excellent job of preventing my dogs from rolling onto the floor during braking. It blocked muddy pawprints."
1,unsatisfied,"My dog weighs 75lbs, about the size of the Golden in the picture, and the product ripped from its supports after just one week. She is a calm dog and the product did not undergo and undue abuse. Most of all, the smell is awful, even after rinsing and air drying."
4,"Protects my car, Protects my Golden Retriever","I would recommend this product to anyone transporting a dirty dog. My Golden Retriever no longer falls in the space in front of the seat when I must decelerate quickly. I us it in my Honda civic and it is fine; there is a bit of dip in the hammock in front of the seat due to the small size of my car, but it is much better than my dog falling in the space between the front and back seats. There are snaps on each of the straps designed to wrap around the headrests, but I keep the straps long enough to just lift over the headrest for an even quicker removal of the blanket when required. The only design change I would make is to not have the seat belt slots in the blanket, as sand and dirt will go through them onto the car seats. I often turn the blanket around so that the slots are towards the front and the pockets on the back, so that any dirt that falls through the slots will go on the floor and not on the upholstery. Duct tape might help."
3,It's okay,"Quality is good - I just don't like the way it fits. A smaller size for smaller cars would make this ideal. But in my small car, it droops in the middle and my collie is still able to roam from front to back seat."
3,OKAY,"Product does a good job of protecting your car seats, but in the case of liquid accidents, the material absorbs NOTHING and therfore the liquid will roll around and around. Also, the range of adjustments that can be made to the hammock to make it fit and work in your car's space is VERY limited. Finally, the hammock doesn't stay in place and shifts easily, especially when your pet is unsettled and moving around in the back seat. You still need to have lots of absorbent towels for clean ups, and if you do not have your pet in a seat belt, some other barrier to keep them from trying to climb into the front seat"
3,"good quality, but not great for my dog","The product is a good quality and would probably work great for someone else. i mainly purchased it to try to keep my dog from getting into the front seat. he outsmarts me and goes around the sides and under, so its not working. it is still great for keeping hair & dirt off the seats though. i would recommend it for people with larger dogs, or not so smart dogs (we have a Basenji...to smart for their own good)."
2,seat cover too short,"The hammock is very well made,and is very strong, but it is too short to cover the seat properly. When our dog jumps onto the hammock his muddy paws hit the seat first. My husband has another brand in his car and he has never had this problem. My car is a sonata so the seat isn't huge."
5,Waterproof hammock seat cover for pets,"Had to go on your US site for this one and I am really, really pleased with it. Good quality, strong and very easy to put up and take down. What's more, the dog is happy too!"
4,Work/worked great,"This hammock worked great for our 80lb German Shepherd for about 2 months. One of the plastic pieces that connect the straps that go around the head rest broke one day! Since then, I've had to tie the straps together, which is not as convenient because then you have to untie it every time you want to take it down. I would like to have seen it being a little bigger. I'm short and so when I drive, I have my seat pulled all the way forward - the hammock doesn't rest on the back seat nicely that way and creates less room for our dog. But the Hammock it self is great. Never any poked holes from nails, keeps our seats a lot cleaner!!"
3,OK,"This product is ok, the smell is not bad. It kept the dog hair and dog nails off my leather seats. It works for what it is."
4,Good waterproof back seat cover for dogs,"Good waterproof material. Didn't see the 2 straps to hook to the front head rests like in the picture, but it might be misplaced after we got it out of the packaging."
4,Pretty good,"I think this is a good product, overall. I like the handles that tuck into the seat to keep the product in place, and I like the metal grommets for the straps to attach to. The only complaint I have is that my dog is able to step over and put his front paws on the console between the driver and passenger seats. Maybe it's how just my car is laid out, but I can't tighten the straps enough around the headrests to make the seat cover taut enough to keep my dog in the back."
4,Keeps the dirt off the seats,I love this product. My dog seems more relaxed too. He is a very nervous traveler but I think that because the hammock allows him to be close to me really helps him.I also like how easy it is to install and remove. It also keeps the car clean by holding the dirt in place. One shake and the dirt comes right off!
3,Good But.....,I purchased this item a year ago and it is great. I have two small dogs and I like the fact that this keeps them from falling onto the floor or coming into the front seat area. I do agree with other reviews that comment about it not getting very clean after washing. I have not experienced the bad smell. I have noticed that the metal clasps over time rub on the headreast and seat area leaving marks. I have leather seats and I started noticing black marks on the area of the seats where these clasps are. I have been looking for some type of substitute clasp or strap but have been unsuccessful. I have found another quilted hammock that uses nylon velcro straps instead. Haven't purchased it for fear the velcro might not be strong enough to handle the weight of a dog.
4,decent cover at a good price,"As the other reviews noted, there is a chemical smell to the cover, but it airs out fairly quickly. Overall, it does a pretty good job of protecting the car seats. But a decent amount of hair does fall through the slits in the cover for the seatbelts. Also, it doesn't work as a barrier to keep my 22lb dog confined to the back seat. Within minutes he'd figured out how to wriggle down between the side edge of the seat cover and the rear passenger door so that he could get to floor of the car and then climb into the front seats. But I bought a seatbelt tether, and the problem was mostly fixed. Altogether, I'm happy w/ this purchase."
3,decent,"I like the material, the size, and that it is water resistant; but with my 150lb dog, by the 2nd day of use the holes the straps clip into tore. No rips on seams from his weight/paws."
2,didn't meet my needs,I have two small dogs. This hammock did not work for my dogs. The material slide on the leather seats making the dogs very uncomfortable.
4,Very nice hammock,This is a very nice heavy duty hammock. Also happy with the color. Don't really understand the pocket(s) concept...well I understand it but don't really see the need and wondered if the price could be lower if they left those off. It also has a very bad chemical smell for the first couple of weeks that forces you to leave your car windows cracked (wide open for the first couple of days). Other then that it is nice and does the job it was designed to do.
4,"Simple, functional and sufficient","There is nothing fancy or luxurious about this hammock. It was a little baggy in the back seat of our Ford Fusion, but our dog isn't particularly active in the car, so that wasn't a problem. It did what it was supposed to do: protect the seat leather from claws and contain the dog hair. I was concerned that the fabric would be static-y or smell bad, as other people have noted in their reviews, but everything was fine. I think that she (the dog) was actually more comfortable with the hammock than without it, since she didn't have to worry about slipping off the front of the seat into the foot area. Since the corners of the hammock get tied to the headrest of the front seats, this creates a secure and dog-free storage location in the foot area. Overall happy that I didn't pay a lot for an item that we only use once in a while for trips. No idea how long it will last or how durable it will be; nothing broke during the week-long cross-country trip."
3,hammock car seat cover,"I am disappointed in the coverage of the back of the seat. My dog does not like laying on it directly so I purchased a soft flat ""pillow"" to put over it. Because of how it fits around the headrests, there is a significant part of the seat edge that is not protected from the dog hair, claws, etc."
2,Good Idea but high rip potential,"The concept of the product was great - it fit in my car perfect, tucked into the seats great but in about a week I saw that it had ripped in a perfect line completely accross the part that meets the bottom of the back rest and the seat - like it had been cut by a knife. No knives in my car... Basially useless to me now. My dog didn't do it and he's the only one back there. Its not a chewed spot because its straight as an arrow and not at the sewn edges so it either had a defect in this particular one or the product is ""split"" sensitive. So buy it if you have a little 4 pound dog but apparently nothing larger."
4,Caw!! Caw!!,"Odin's Ravens is a fantastic game. My wife and I played a number of times over the past few months - say about (8) sittings - and it continues to be our #2 rated game (behind Ticket-to-Ride). The game is quick, easy, and either of us can win. There is an unexpected element of screwage, too, like when you're walking away from the ping-pong cup guy at the carnival and he's laughing just loud enough for you to hear...Playing time scales to what we have available, which is another plus. Since individual rounds are quick, there are a lot of natural pauses that allow us to run the household: take the dog out, take the garbage down, brush our teeth, etc.It has a balance of strategy and luck, which works great for our Tuesday game night. And we have a blast cawing at each other like angry ravens. Caw!! Caw!!I debated going with an overall (5) rating, but am going to stay with a very solid (4). Still, though, it's a (5) on fun."
1,Jenkins - friend of WTC attack supporters,"Jenkins is best known as the translator and friend of Dario Fo and Franca Rame, the Italian writer and actress who released a statement containing the following sentence immediately after the Sept. 11 WTC attacks, when the ruins were still smoldering and the ashes of the dead were still burning the eyes of the residents of New York:""The great speculators wallow in an economy that every year kills tens of millions of people with poverty -- so what is 20,000 dead in New York?""There is a huge difference between being a Communist, and vigorously opposing U.S. foreign policy, and thinking that the incineration of 20,000 people (or, as it turned out, 6,500) is inconsequential. How could you ever, ever pay for a book and send royalties to someone who supports such heartless people?"
2,Get what you paid for,They sent me different patches that are similar to the ones pictured/that I ordered. The shipping cost was more than the items themselves. It wasn't worth returning so I just kept them. The ones sent looked different (colors & shape) but are probably the same quality. I would rate this 4 stars if I had received the correct items.
4,Family focused simple story about the Autumn Season,"A simple story about things that a family can do in autumn. Depicts apple picking with the family at an apple farm, pumpkin picking, and carving a jack-o-lantern. The last three pages feature trick or treating with the children dressed as: pirate, ghost, queen and a devil.This is a short story with illustrations going across both pages, bright colors, hand drawn.This book has a low word count and is for very young children, from toddlers through age five or perhaps even six. This is perfect for use by Preschool, Kindergarten teachers and homeschoolers when the teacher wants to read books about the autumn season. Of course it is also good for parents to read to children.I enjoyed that the book was family focused and about a family doing things together, versus just talking about apples and pumpkins."
1,Duet for the Devil - HORRIBLE AND BORING,"When I first got this book, I could not wait to read it. I got thru the first 50 pages, and had to throw the damn thing in the garbage. It was like reading a book written by 10 diffrent people, none knowing what the other was writing about. Was it gory, sure but it was also horribly boring!! I love books, and would not throw away any book that comes into my hands, but there is always a first, and this was the one that did it. I would not suggest this book to anyone for any reason (except maybe to tranzilize you before bed)."
5,Great story!,"I have tried all of Margolis's novels and the only ones I really liked were Apocalipstick, Breakfast at Stephanie's and this one. I really loved the storyline of the baby store and the annoying celebrity mothers in Gucci Gucci Coo. It had a great mystery as well that kept me sucked in. This is definitely her best yet!"
2,Be Forewarned,Humorous but crude. Well written but sexually explicit. Be aware that the lust-obssessed characters and some graphically described sex scenes detract from an otherwise entertaining plot.
3,"cute book,fast read",The book itself was adorable except the cover was seperated from the book so it had to be trashed after reading it.
3,Cute read...,"I agree with another poster, it was slow at first but did pick up. There are some sex scenes played out in the book but from the looks of her other books, that is how this author is. This book wouldn't be my first recommendation but if someone asked, I would tell them to read it."
4,like all david lindsey books.....,"this is a decent thriller , at this point i don't have a favoritemaybe not a household name in the thriller genre , but should be"
2,Not the least bit memorable,"Now that I am finished with this novel and have moved on to my next read, I am having a hard time remembering much about David Lindsey's ""An Absence of Light"". Being a big fan of concise writing styles, such as Michael Crichton and Greg Iles, I found Lindsey's overly descriptive style distracting, particularly since the prose was often irrelevant to the action. If you are a fan of very wordy authors, I would direct you to someone like a Pat Conroy (of Prince of Tides fame), who despite being extremely descriptive and downright wordy, does it extremely well.I wouldn't describe it as a bad book or a horrible read, just an extremely ambivalent one."
4,Katakune,"Katakune is seven year old silkworm who lives in a magical and wonderful world named Tazzleland. He has a whole bunch of friends, they learn important lessons about life, they go on incredible adventures and find out about the wonderful world all around them. This is a magical world which any child would be delighted to be a part of."
2,"Selections great, sound quality not.",I currently own nine cds by the famous group and Celebration was the first one I bought. While I was pleased with the selection of songs on the cd I was disappointed with the sound quality. The entire recording sounded as though it was done under a heavy blanket and subsequently I gave the cd away. I'd like to know if subsequent releases sound better.
5,"Difficult to find, but priceless!","If you need a first person account of what farming life was like in the early 1900's, this is the book to read. Mr. Brookens wit and wisdom shine in this small tome."
5,magical. it is medicine for todays sickening music,"once again, they have created an incredible, fresh LP that helps us escape today's mainstream. They have looked to other influences this time though. while their skeleton key EP and self titled LP looked to late 60's california psychedelic, Magic and Medicine looks towards california surf and 60's country music. This record sounds a lot like it could have been a Gram Parsons era Byrds record. The songs work best when heard in context to the rest of the album. otherwise, ""pass it on"" (the current single) seems and is the best shot for a solid single from this album. I would recommend getting the UK version on double orange vinyl. it is a great buy. also, pick up the lim. edition numbered vinyl of ""pass it on"" with an acoustic version of ""shadows fall"" as the b-side."
2,Not a os fits all!,"I'm 5'6"" and ordered this supposed one size fits all and was disappointed to fInd out that it was several inches too short. I ended up having to wear them because I didn't have enough time to find another pair."
5,Sigma 70-300 Macro Zoom Combo Package,"A very good deal. For a few dollors more, you can get a top quality lens, some filters, lens kit and screen protection films. As with all Sigma lens, the picture quality is excellent. I agree with other reviews that at 300 mm, it is difficult not to get some blur, but not impossible. It comes down to shutter speed. A higher ISO setting tends to help and naturally a monopod or tripod is best. All in all, for the money, I have no complaints and if anything goes wrong, I have a 6 year warranty."
2,Sigma 28-300mm :(,"Well i got this lens about a month ago, and well im not to happy with it. all of my images come out soft/fuzzy using both auto and manual focus, it does not work well in low light situations, and i dont believe it goes to a true 300mm. I have a vivitar 70-210mm and it zooms in closer that the sigma 28-300mm does, and it produces better quality images. The only good thing about this lens is that it is built sturdy, its heavy, and the macro feature works great. I used this lens to shoot some portraits for a client and had to reshoot all of them with a different lens because of the poor quality the lens produces. I would not recommend this lens. It would be worth while to save the money and buy a canon lens."
3,"Not a ""bad"" book...an attempt to share the word","Well, after I read all the strong attacks of THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JESUS, I had to see what Stephen Mitchell had done to upset so many. Sure, fundamentalists will not be open to this reinterpretation of Jesus, let alone the Gospels, but Mitchell is a wise person who has given us some wonderful interpretations. The same holds here...he writes so well, the Gospel comes alive with a voice that holds attention. However, I too object to Mitchell's premises of Jesus as a ""bastard,"" and even less founded Jesus and Mary as a dysfunctional family. It's a needless attack and without evidence. His Gospel deserved better than that. Read around in this book...it's worth it."
1,Bad Scholarship,"Anyone can take parts of the New Testament to show this or that (in Mitchell's case to support the Zen view of Jesus). The point is to study it as a whole in an academic manner. I would recommend Meier ""Marginal Jew"" or Brown ""Death of the Messiah"" or even Grimbol's ""Idiot's Guide to Life of Christ"" If you must translate and comment fine, but don't edit, and do use historical evidence. Really shallow, and I am not a fundamentalist or Catholic; I am a bleeding heart liberal."
3,For the non-traditional Christian,"I wish Mitchell began this book with more autobiographical material. He spent many years halfway around the world finding spiritual truths in Zen Buddhism. How could he not find Western Christianity a little bit lacking? I found the most perceptive insights speculate on Jesus' psychology as an ""illegitimate"" child. Did the local community know Joseph was not Jesus' biological father? One wonders how this might have affected Jesus. This book is not for devout traditional Christians, although more liberal Christians might enjoy it."
1,A waste of time,"I write this as a seeker, not as a dreaded fundamentalist or, God forbid, a Catholic, as another reviewer has noted. Why is Mitchell's book so popular that it has even been made into a television program? He has done nothing but select passages from here and there in the Gospels to illustrate that Jesus was quite the teacher. This leaves the reader at the mercy of the author's editing. For example, right at the beginning, we see Jesus baptized by John. Mitchell then omits the incredible result of that baptism, the real stuff of the passage. The reader asks what he has been ""taught"" by Mitchell's truncated version. The New Testament itself provides the answer!"
5,SIMPLE YET PROFOUND,"I would recommend this book to anyone seeking spiritual truth. Mitchell has done a wonderful job of research to find the inconsistencies in other works, including the bible. What remains are not versions of the truth written by those with a personal agenda, but the simple message of the Christ: The Kingdom is Within. Why dogmatic religions don't get this is still beyond my comprehension. Perhaps it's to keep people living in fear of suffering an eternal inferno, or to keep the religious hierarchy alive. But when the man called Jesus embodied the Christ his point was clear: don't follow me, but your own wisdom, for you have the Christ within as well."
5,great book.........,"...but the fudamentalist won't like it! But they don't like much of anything that goes against their narrow, exclusive beliefs.The Gospel According to Jesus is a magnificent, large-hearted book that makes Jesus come alive again. If you are burnt out on ""fundagelicalism"", then read this book and be refreshed!"
5,This book influenced me to write a entire novel.,"I've enjoyed half a dozen books by Stephen Mitchell, across a broad range of topics. He's an excellent writer and translator, and I consider his rendering of the Tao Teh Ching to be the best of the more than twenty I've studied. This particular ""gospel"" gives the only view of Jesus and his teachings that actually inspires me.Reading this book led me to muse about the bullying that a young Jesus---an illegitimate son in the eyes of his neighbors---must have endured in his home village. An entire tale took shape in my mind about the missing decades in his life. The tale evolved into my fifth published novel,The Bastardwhich Kirkus Reviews calls, ""A compelling what-if story about an approachable, human Jesus."""
5,Revelations!,"There is much here to open the mind and soul. When I read about Jesus being born ""illegitamately"" by a woman considered in her time to be a whore it raced me back to my earlier life:a young woman of the sixties, draped in ""free love"",practicing ""questionable"" behaviors that went unchecked and produced two children who bore(perhaps still do)the brunt end, much to my dismay.I was standing in the middle of a busy work area when it dawned on me the gravity of it all and in the twinkling of a eye I felt that I was Holy just the way I was; the good, the bad, and the ugly. And here, I've thought there was no way I or my children could ever be redeemed...and yet, here is Mary and Jesus. How sweet it is! This is just one tiny example of the provocative, challenging, and delicious food for the soul that one can truly sink one's teeth into, chew, swallow, digest and be nurtured in. Be careful, it's easy to overeat!"
5,I dare say a must read for the spiritual,"Do you think Jesus acts schitzophrenic in the Biblical gospels? Humble and loving one moment, Hell and Damnation the next? Buddhist Mitchell culls away two millenia of popular myth to reveal a Jesus that is a universal and benevolent Jewish sage, and a real, accessible human being.This book affected me deeply, helping me to clean the dirt off the mirror, and realize things Lao Tzu would say I already knew."
4,The Gospel according to Jesus,"This book brought to light a lot of detailed truths about Jesus that most people are not aware of, being that there are so many untruths embeded in religious Teachings, it is good to have them brought forth. Especially the thoughts and feelings of other great Minds as of the likes of Thomas Jefferson, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Spinoza, William Blake, Henry David Thoreau, Leo Tolstoy, George Bernard Shaw, Mohandas K Gandhi & Ramana Maharshi.Thanks to Stephen Mitchell for taking this journey.Link NMB SC"
1,this book is dumb,this is what happens when you lose your job. you get mad at your boss and right a book for money
1,Piece of trash,"This ""book"" is just a piece of trash written by a sad sad publicist in need of cash. Michael Jackson has been surrounded by people who are desperate to cash in on his name and fame. Unfortunately, Mr Jones is no exception. Put this ""book"" where it belongs : In the garbage !"
3,Fact or Fiction?,"This book was very interesting. I don't believe some of the stuff but who knows. It does seem that he was trying to help MJ understand how his relationship with kids could be mis-understood, but MJ didn't care which appears to be a common theme about MJ (he didn't care what others thought about his friendship with little kids). Jones died in 2007 and it would have been interesting to hear what he thought about MJ now. Stacy Brown has been on several shows speaking as a 'friend' of the Jackson family since MJ's death, so his credibility is questionable. Good book but you have to come to your own conclusions on whether you think its fact or fiction."
1,Anything for money!,"It is so sad what people will do for money. Lying, sensationalizing, disrespecting and profitting off another under those reasons is simply wrong. But then again, many people have been doing that to Michael Jackson for years. It's little wonder he hurt. Don't buy this book and allow these kinds of people to treat their fellow man in this way."
1,Crap,"Don't waste your money on a book filled of lies. Which is exactly what Bob Jones' book is. Please don't believe the crap you hear about Michael Jackson, because in truth, it isn't true. This is Bob Jones' attempt at money and you shouldn't support it. Don't waste your cash on that filthy tabloid trash!"
5,Splaboo! Jackson Picture Painted In Color,"Splaboo! Many African Americans, and I am one of them, always knew Michael Jackson hated us. The Man Behind The Mask by Bob Jones and Stacy Brown- two Afro-Americans themselves- confirm all of our deepest and darkest suspicions about the has been probable pedophile. His crazed, lunatic fans will say what they will, but the cold hard facts are in The Man Behind The Mask. I don't blame Jackson's family for supporting him in his trial, but it would deeply sicken me even more if they keep up the charade by not getting him some real help. But, it seems that the entire Jackson family needs years of therapy. Best wishes to them."
1,A waste of money!,"I am so mad that I wasted my money on this piece of garbage! I've ordered several biographies on MJ since his death. I'm halfway through ""Conspiracy"" by Aphrodite Jones. It's a great book that I would recommend to anyone who wants to know what exactly went on during the 2005 molestation trial. It looks to me that this book was written by an angry ex-employee. I threw my copy in the garbage after he started comparing MJ with the devil. There are numerous people that once worked for MJ that have nothing but praises for him. I'm so sick of people trying to make him out to be a pervert."
2,No Shock & Awe,"""The Man behind the Mask,"" isn't the shock & awe folks were expecting to read prior to the book comingout.Jackson's demeanor, his way of doing things, are something most of us already knew about him with the exception of a few new tidbits that were rather odd to believe.As for Opri's claim about Jones having an ax to grind, it should be more how callous the Jackson camp can be when one works as many years as Jones did to be crudely fired in a mysterious manner without any benefits.Yet, throughout the book, Jones indicates that ""he never saw the 'king' as he calls him, touch a child inappropriately while he was working with him."" He acted strange, nothing new there, but that's it.In all...save your money ...it's not a ""THRILLER."""
2,Michael Jackson- The Man Behind the Mask,A very short story- disorganized story telling from a bitter past manager. This story could have been summed up in less then 500 words.I found it to be a waste of my time.
1,"LIES, LIES and LIES...","It's written by two BITTER, FIRED EX-EMPLOYEES.I would suggest a realy FACTUAL biography of the LEGENDARY GENIUS that is Mr Jackson. Go and buy ""Visual Documentary"" by Adrian Grant."
1,DISGUSTING!,"EX-employee. 'Nuff said.just another money hungry, bitter ex employee lying for a little fame and money.dont waste you cash on this pack of lies!!!"
3,It's worth reading,"Does Jones look bad by claiming to have known about all this for years, but only coming out with it now that he's been fired? To an extent, yes. Did the mother of the plaintif in this most recent case come off as suspect? Perhps. Does that make any of these allegations or evidence any less true? Nope. Regardless of how much you like Jackson's music, some people's childlike adoration of him doesn't mean that he's incapable of having and fulfilling weird desires and appetites. This isn't the first time he's been accused; I believe he's made two huge payouts to two different accusers. You don't do that if you've got nothing to hide (just check out the big tobbaco companies). What we have with all of this whi6ning by people who obviously haven't and wouldn't read this book is people whose lives are so barren that they must invest all of their effort and emotion in defending the reputation of some superstar perv who most likely wouldn't even loan them five dollars if asked. Losers."
1,Dont waste your money,"Another bitter ex-employee..this is getting tired.Bob Jones a long time employee of Michael Jacksons turns strapped-for-cash backstabber. Now thats one we havent heard before. This book offered no interesting insights, the authors motives for writing are highly questionable given the timing of the book and certain scenarios sound fabricated so that it will sell well. This book will only sell well to small minded and gullible people with no interest in exploring factual information, something this book severely lacks.The only factual information concerning Michael Jackson this year is Not Guilty 10 times over."
1,Credibility Issues!!,"Let's be serious now....Are we to believe that this man suspected and witnessed these horrible things about Michael Jackson, but wasn't compelled to come out and tell the truth about any of it until he was fired?? So, let me see, as long as he was employed by Michael Jackson these things were okay...Yeah, that's someone I'd give a lot of credibility too!I didn't spend a dime on this and hope that you don't either."
1,A turncoat and a poor writer,"I read thsi book IN THE BOOKSTORE, and thank God I didn't waste my money on this. It is chock full of misspellings and grammatical errors and it is written by two people who, after defending MJ for years, obviously have an axe to grind because they can no longer sponge off of him.All I will say is this -- Bob Jones worked with and for MJ for 20-to 30-odd years, and claims to have no money to show for it? HELLO?? Has he never heard of a savings account? And that's supposed to be MJ's fault. COME ON!!!I wipe my @ss with this book!!!"
1,Disgusting.,"In court Bob Jones admitted that this book was full of untruths.Mr. Brown, I find it hard to believe that you can look yourself in the mirror every day or even sleep at night. Have you no conscience?"
1,Theresa Gonsalves,Dont waste your money on this get rich quick scheme check out a real good page turner. Obsessions By Theresa Gonsalves. She is the real Bille Jean and was featured in the VH1 Special Michael Jackson's Childhood secrets.
2,Funny as h.e.l.l.,"These people sure know how to spin a good piece of fiction. I couldn't stop laughing. It really was hilarious. Some of this stuff was so outrageous. The reason I give two stars is because they reveal that Lisa Marie did in fact still love Michael, and after his death despite some badmouthing interviews she gave over the years. This proved to be true, even though Lisa Marie did not realize it until he was actually gone. The rest was pure amusement at MJ's expense. If you read it as fiction you will enjoy it. This is just one of those books that is the epitome of how Jackson was treated by all the tabloids found conveniently all in one place. (RIP MJ, miss you.)"
1,A Bunch of Bull,I couldn't even get through half of it. It was so unbelievable. More salacious lies about Michael Jackson from disgruntled ex-employees who used Michael as an ATM machine. Don't even bother.
1,"Poorly Written, Factually Incorrect","I find it interesting that Jones has known Michael Jackson for as long as his has, yet he fails miserably in getting the most basic information about Jackson correct. The book was seemingly not edited at all, because it if was, a lot of the most glaring mistakes would have been caught. Unless that is, Jones just didn't care about this. He comes off as being a very bitter old man who wanted something for nothing. It is now clear who has been behind the Jackson rumor mill all these years."
1,"Revenge, and poorly written at that","Having read Jones' book, I can't help but wonder why it is that he has been working so long for Jackson and has had only good things to say then, but now, once he has been fired, suddenly Jackson is this bad lunatic who can't stand to see his sibbling's success, has little moral sense, etc.Why, for God's sake would you continue working for such a man for so many years? If Jones had had integrity, and a sense of what is wrong or right, he would have stopped working for Jackson right away. But he ended up working 34 years of his life for the man, and what does that tell us about him and his integrity?Therefore, this book is worth exactly the same as all the other books written by former employees, scorned wives (and such likes) - NOTHING.Moreover, it has no literary value whatsoever.In my opinion, it is a poorly-written attempt of revenge."
1,Not credible at all.,"One has to wonder why Mr. Jones would work for Michael for 34 years if he really thought he was a racist, pedophile. Bob Jones had nothing but good things to say about Michael Jackson until he got fired. Mr. Jones claims that he's not a disgruntled ex- employee, but this book says differently. This book is nothing but a cheap attempt to make Michael Jackson look bad. It's filled with lies and sensational stories. All of that and the book wasn't even written well."
2,Not that good. It's a letdown.,"Explosive revelations are actually few and far between. The reader is left with the impression that Mr. Jones has much more to say; unfortunately, he is overshadowed by Stacy Brown's commentary - much of it is padded with quotations from magazines, newspapers, and J. Randy Taraborelli's Michael Jackson: The Magic and the Madness (still the definitive biography of Michael Jackson).Does Michael Jackson have serious issues? Definitely. Is Bob Jones just a bitter ex-employee with an ax to grind? Possibly. But there is another question that must be asked: is this book worth our time and money?The answer is no. There is very little in this book that has not already been said by others. The rest of it is probably best described as apocryphal.Furthermore, this book is poorly edited and has all the slap-dash feel of a term paper written 8 hours before deadline."
1,Bitter and Miserable,"I read: Michael Jackson man behind the Mask , first off I'm disgusted at myself for even wasting a penny on this book. It was nothing but made up stories that a ( so called) grown man has written?? anyways please dont waste neither time nor money I am throwing mine in the garbage. I want to hear real facts and stories whether good or bad and I wasn't her to judge Micheal (we are no one to judge),I just wanted to know why so much pain?and hear of course about his talent. I guess thee's only one Mand and that is Michael J. Jackson who knows why. THE BOOK I CAN SAY IS Pretty good is "" THE MAGIC AND the MADNESS, "" and DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE NEW ONE MICHAEL UNMASKED TOTAL BORE AND PLAIN STUPID (as this one, which is even worst and made no sense!!!!! p.s. WHY? were you fired??no true detail."
3,I believe him -- but the book needed editing,"Bob Jones was well respected in the industry and worked with MJackson for several decades. He saw things that Jackson did with little boys, that pointed to pedophilia, and he witnessed the payoffs. He claims that the payoffs in the millions is what drove MJackson to insolvency; plus, we know the lavish lifestyle. I believe Bob Jones, who is now deceased, however, this book needed a major edit.It's out of sequence time wise. It jumps all over the place, starting out in 2004 and then back to 1993 and then back to 2004. He writes about the dysfunctional family, but we've been reading about the dysfunctional family for many years. And now that Jackson is dead, it shows just how maniacal his father is and how his family of Jackson brothers cannot make a go in the business without Mjackson's name.It's worth reading, but I wanted to tear it apart and put the pages in sequence."
5,The Truth Beyond the Media Hype,"Finally, a book from an insider who dares to come out from behind the media machine that protects Michael Jackson (and stars like him) to tell the truth. For the real inside scoop look no further than the man with the full time job of cleaning up Michael's messes.Protecting Jackson is no easy task. Other reviews on here dismiss the book as written by someone with an ax to grind. Not so. Whether you love Michael Jackson or simply want to know more about his eccentric behavior, this book is a must read."
1,Another vulture using Jackson for money.,"After seeing how the media ripped apart Michael Jackson and their extreme bias to the point of manipulating the public's perception of what turned out to be clearly proven false accusations (please research the facts before buying into the media spin), and seeing how many people have backstabbed Jackson for monetary and career gain, I have to approach a book like this with much skepticism. Mr. Jones has quite an axe to grind, and when I saw him being interviewed, he seemed quite cagey and unclear in his answers...except when asked why he decided to write this book, he said something like ""I'm doing this for Bob Jones.""The accusations of Jackson being a racist and not helping his family are utterly and verifiably false. This alone makes his book unreliable at best."
1,WHAT A WASTE!! DON'T BOTHER!!,"If you are a believer of Michael and a fan, and you want to be utterly pissed off, buy this book! This book is nothing more than a worthless man trying to get revenge for being fired from the biggest star of all time. He basically calls Michael a racist, a child molester, and all sorts of other nasty things without actually using those words. This guy makes me sick. There's no wonder this book was in the bargain section being cleared out of inventory. Don't waste your money or your time. This is nothing more than tabloid garbage. Michael always said...""don't read the tabloids. It's garbage. 99% of it isn't true."" This book will make a wonderful fire starter in the fireplace this winter. Thanks, Bob!"
1,Mean spirited creapy trash,"This book is full of fabrications and written with exceptional cruelty by former disgruntled employees and is not worth your precious time. It is truly unfortunate this book exists.If you want a good MJ read, try Aphrodite Jones ""Michael Jackson Conspiracy"" and J. Randy Tarborelli's ""The Magic, The Madness, The Whole Story."""
2,Leaves me wondering,I just had to say that I read this book because I'm a huge Michael Jackson fan and everything in here conflicts with what everyone else says about him. I think that Bob took truths and twisted them or added things to make Michael look bad because he was bitter about being let go. If the things he said were true he wouldn't have continued to work for Michael. I think money was the only reason Bob wrote this book and through his bitterness the truth got lost.
1,heh..,"well isnt this just pathetic... after making this book, he made it official; his career is over for good.Who will want to have a lying media runt backstabber like him working for you?! He is just desperatley trying to find someway to make some money again, since Michael fired his sorry lying ass out!"
1,Pure Fiction,Terrible ficticious book and so obvious it's made up by a disgruntled ex employee to make money from it . I wouldn't waste your money.
1,A Must Not Read,"I am totally amazed that this book ever made print. It is so poorly written and even worse, there appears to have been no attempt at editing. It screams of tabloid sensationalism, treachery and revenge, it is full of malicious lies, inaccuracies and discrepancies, but is a perfect read for those die-hard Jackson haters and members of the public who aren't concerned with the truth.For those who have common sense and are willing to read a book that is based on truth and integrity; not on the words of a disgruntled employee and a reporter who found an opportunity to use Jackson as a means to make some money and a name for themselves, this book is a must not read! Instead, read something of literary value based on facts: Michael Jackson Conspiracy, by Aphrodte Jones."
1,Bull. Crap.,"Much-- ALL of this book has been debunked by Jermaine Jackson AND Aprhodite Jones. It holds no merit. The author is bitter because he didn't get the chance to take advantage of MJ like he wanted to, so what better way to get back at Michael and his fan base by creating a work of pure fiction? That's the route this idiot took."
1,Garbage,"Stacy Brown has been getting a lot of play on TV lately with all the news about the Murray trial. He's billed as an ""insider."" Well, he wasn't an insider, he was a tabloid style reporter who tried to profit from Michael Jackson's trial with the Arvizos. Much of this book, written in conjunction with Bob Jones, is complete fiction. If you want to know the truth of Bob Jones and Stacy Brown, read Aphrodite Jones' book."
1,Another opportunist!!,When will the sychophants and leeches stop coming out of the woodwork whenever there is money to be made of off the back of Michael Jackson. When will they stop feeding off of his bones. Ridiculous book! Some of these so called stories don't even make sense. Don't waste your hard earned money.
1,"Disappointing book from Jackson ""insider""","This was a disappointing book. It seems Jones has some anger. His descriptions of MJ don't ""jive"" with other books I've read about superstar Jackson. I was looking forward to reading this ""insider"" book, but I just don't believe this author."
1,His testimony shows that this book is untrue,"During the trial Bob Jones testified that the book contained some true things and some ""fiction."" He came off looking pretty shifty in court. He is a disgruntled former employee out to make a buck."
1,"oh please, he got caught in court","this fool tried to play off his lies in court. he testified at the '93 grand juries and said he saw nothing. so doing a salacious book was the only reason he was called to testify in 2005.this man tried so hard to pin all the lies on stacey brown until he was shown emails he wrote confirming the lies.no credibility and no loyalty to do this to a man he's worked since the man was a damn child.if he lied about this, he lied about the circumstances surrounding his 'retirement'"
4,Believable,"I have read this book and am re-reading it. I find that the quotes that are from Mr. Jones seem to be true and valid. Sometimes it is hard to believe someone who worked with a person for many years, if you think they may have some bitterness, but this author seems to be genuine.I am a HUGE MJ fan. Have been all my life. This book gives you a close-up view from another of the uncountable people that were in MJ's life for some time.Recommended reading."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Don't waste your time or money on this book. Written by a disgruntled former employee of Michael Jackson's, it is full of speculation and slander. This book is nothing more than tabloid stories and lies. If you want the truth about Michael Jackson you won't find it here. This is book is almost as bad as the one by Diane Diamond, 'Be Careful Who You Love.' Pure crap."
1,Just Like Tom Sneddon:Bob Jones got Swept,"always a Axe to grind&you can bet cash money that dude thought it was lights out for MJ upon writing this Book,but a funny thing Happen:NOT GUILTY all the way across the Board. so just how Tom Sneddon got Swept that is what Bob Jones is feeling now.MJ doesn't unload folks unless there is a strong reason.yeah the Book tells some interesting tells but How come you gotta wait until you think it's gonna be Lights up to Man up&Put this Book out? MJ ain't ran from nothing.Stacy Brown is also shady as well.get the Broom Out because all got SWEPT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Go on and Treat yourself at TACO BELL instead!!!!!,Please don't waste your money on this crap like I did. I personally wouldn't even use it to wipe my arse. Instead I highly recommend you go treat yourself at Taco Bell. It will be highly satisfying and thoroughly enjoyable. However if you still feel the need for some juicy gossip in the league of Bob Jones - the national enquirer is only $3!!!! So for a few dollars you get a delicious meal and some slanderous gossip...PLUS!! it is available in an easily disposable medium so once you've read the cover and looked at the pix you can burn it! Now IF ONLY Bob Jones had copied the national enquirer formula in its entirety - unfortunate individuals like me wouldn't be stuck with this dead weight.
1,Disgruntled employee writes book about boss,This book is a work of fiction that is written by an employee that was terminated and holds a grudge. The author's sour attitude taints the whole book. Steer clear of this opportunistic piece junk. It may appeal to tabloid readers who don't care about the truth but not to too many others.
1,Don't Believe It,Bob said himself in court he didn't even spend alot of time at Neverland and didn't see Mj as often as people think he did. Also the book was all over the place! I mean damn who put this book together. He was jumping from kid to kid and couldn't even keep the names together. This was nothing more than a book to make MJ look bad by someone he fired.
1,Only People That Hate Micheal Gave This Trash Five Stars,"Readers please don't waste your hard earn money on this trash, it is not worth the paper that it was printed on. I read the sample of this trash book, and decided not to help finance this angry black author (I am Black also). Just because this person was there with Michael don't mean all that he written about is true. Espsecially after he got fired by Michael he find a way to cash in on Micheal by written this trash for money and revenge. And only people that really like this mess is the people that hate and were envious of Michael's music, wealth and fame. By the way Bob Jones why did you get fired after being with Michael for so long, my guess is that he couldn't trust you anymore. A dead man can't defend himself from your trashy so call book."
1,BOB JONES HAS AN AXE TO GRIND,"Don't belive the trash in this book. He was an employee of Michael's for many years and got fired, then wrote this book because he was ""MAD"" that he got fired. He worked many years for Michael. Just read about him in the ""Michael Jackson Conspiracty book. He is just another lier out to get Michael.IT'S JUST A GET EVEN BOOK FULL OF LIES AND TRASHING Michael."
1,I am sorry I wasted my money on this crap.,"I had a hard time reading all these lies. When I was finished reading it, I actually took the book out to our burn barrel and set it on fire. I did not want to take the chance of someone else getting their hands on this book of lies."
1,Anything for Money,"One of Jackson's songs has the line ""anything for money, lie for you, die for you, even sell my soul to the devil"" I think Bob Jones and Stacy Brown have both sold their souls with this book. So many inaccuracies and ludicrous stories - to be honest I didn't even finish it as I lost interest. Reading the tabloids would have given me more facts.If you really want to know about the 2005 trial, I suggest you spend your money on ""Conspiracy"" by Aphrodite Jones who gives a pretty fair account of what happened and why Jackson's acquittal was justified. His brother's book ""You Are Not Alone"", recently published is also an interesting and reliable read - unlike this work of fiction.There's nothing like a disgruntled employee to stab you in the back."
2,Notexactly,I was expecting something for the novice to be able to read and take something from it. But it was not very informative.
3,Little book with lots of information,"A quick read. A little book with lots of information, very handy for finding quick facts. I read it cover to cover a few times just to let the essential tips sink in."
2,There are better books out there...,I bought this book because it was super cheap at the time. I really didn't learn anything that I couldn't have found on the internet for free.
2,Not a dictionary,"This book is a list of words in alphabetical order. It is not a dictionary. Lists acronyms, etc., for medical transcriptionists."
3,Don't buy this 10th Edition; buy the latest 12th Ed. (2006),"To save some money, I decide to buy the 10th Edition (1997) of the MERM. For my surprise, this 10th edition has an ""errata"" as long as the ""Highway to Hell"". I have to print over 15 pages, 8.5"" x 11"", of these errata and waist 3 days making the corrections on the entire book. So, don't made this mistake. Buy the 12th edition for a few additional bucks.**Talk to your congressman: Independence for Puerto Rico NOW!** (Right now, Puerto Rico is a US territory)"
4,"Outstanding general reference, very good study material","This reference manual is an outstanding guide for all things engineering. It gives a good summary a broader range of topics than an engineer will face in a lifetime, and most summaries contain references to additional materials if you want more information. For that, it makes a great reference for a working engineer, but it also makes it a bit awkward as a study guide for the PE exam--there are many subjects covered in this book that are too esoteric for the exam. Use the book while you study for the exam and mark the useful sections, you'll be glad you did. Of the 10 books I carried to the exam, this is one of the 3 that I actually used to solve problems."
4,Good product,"These are just about as good as advertised. Pretty high quality sound reproduction and when you turn the volume up you can hear things you would not usually hear. Loud noises are greatly attenuated to where they don't bother you at all. No hum at all and only a barely perceptible hiss when the volume is up high. Not sure how well the lower priced units work, but I have no regrets with this one."
5,Better Than I Dreamed!,"I used the headset at an indoor range while there were a lot of large-caliber handguns being fired. They were fabulous! When there was no noise, they amplified voices so they could be easily heard. But at no time did I ever get hit with the noise from a weapon being fired. It cycled so quickly I didn't even notice. They are worth every penny of their cost!"
4,excellent hearing protection,purchased for my new hobby of handgun practice at the range. these do the job blocking out the loud discharge sounds but allow conversation in between. quality product
3,Good headphones but terrible manual,"Why oh why does a manufacturer make a quality product, and then send it out with such a bad manual? The manual is really only 2 pages of text, and a very lazy effort. There are many more details on this they could have included, and it leaves out a lot of tips. And the tiny drawings are incomprehensible. For this kind of money, I expected a better manual and better packaging.For example, how to TURN this thing on correctly. You can't just press the button. You have to press and hold the button for 3 seconds. And then you will hear a tone. If you don't hear the tone, then your device is either broken or your battery situation is bad. Does the manual say this? Nope.Also, the font in the manual is TINY. For Pete's sake, make a better manual, use a larger and darker font, and realize not all your customers are 18-yo kids with great eyes.You lose 2 stars for the bad manual."
2,Problems with Peltor,"I received four earmuffs and one of the four had a whine in the left earpiece so I am sending it back. The foam wind screens are poorly designed as they have four very fragile prongs sticking up that hold the foam on. They are very easily broken off as they are not protected. They cost $8 a pair and are not covered by the warranty and are difficult to find, I had to order from Peltor and pay almost as much in shipping. I tell everyone to stay away from this product."
5,"This is a great product, worth every penny.","I have owned Peltor Hearing protectors for many years, I have owned electronic hearing protectors for about 4 years. I recently bought the Peltor Tactical Pro Hearing protectors. I wish I had bought them 4 years ago, I am a Detective in a CSI unit. I am responsible for test firing all firearms brought in for evidence, along with all the shooting from work, I shoot extensively recreationally and as an instructor. These are without a doubt the best, clearest, most comfortable hearing protectors I have used. Clarity is important when dealing with students on a firing range. These protectors are now a required part of my kit bag. I love them. Check them out, they are worth every penny."
4,Bing for your bucK.,Love the head set. Works good with my glasses and hat. There is white noise but if you double up with plugs can't even hear. Should of bought one of these too start off with then all those other ones.
5,Excellent Hearing Protection & External Audio,"I purchased the Peltor hearing protector for shooting both guns and fireworks. They are comfortable ear cups, markedly more so than cheaper ones, and they worked well even over the plastic frame of my eyeglasses. The external audio component is superb, easy to hear the range master at the gun range, and while shooting fireworks, I could turn it up and hear crickets not audible to my normal hearing. I bought the audio cable, expensive at $25.00, but it works well to listen to an iPod. The MT15H7F is in between the cheaper Peltor line and their more expensive full tactical headsets. You should also consider the same model in a behind the head configuration, and there is a model fitted to a Peltor hardhat."
5,Pleased with Peltor,"The 3M Peltor Tactical Pro Hearing Protector is something I should have bought years ago instead of shoving those spongy, conical shaped plugs in my ears! The Peltor Electronic allows me the protection and the freedom to hear everything around me. It's a wonderful aid and I recommend them highly for work or play.Pete ZahnerYpsilanti, MI"
1,Dead on arrival,"I Received these today. They were dead on arrival. Instruction are very limited, which didn't help. Hopefully these are an exception to the rule, but I will find a different brand to get next time.I have since bought Pro Ears Gold. Now that is a great set of hearing protectors!!!"
1,Poor quality control,"This item arrived defective (electronics did not work), and I returned it for an exchange. Amazon immediately sent out another one by overnight express delivery. Unfortunately the second unit was also defective. Since two other reviewers had similar problems, I can only conclude that the quality control for this expensive item is not very good. Even if I received a working unit, I would be afraid that the electronics wouldn't last very long. I returned the second unit and ordered a Howard Leight Impact Sport Earmuff instead."
1,Cheap Plastic,"I was shocked when I opened the box, this looks like a $20 pair of muffs. I'm not sure I want to keep these muffs, WAY overpriced for the low quality. Is this someones idea of a joke? these can't be worth more than $20-30.Don't company's care what consumer think anymore?Update 02/11/2012My review was short,so I will add some more information after taking them to the range about 20 times, I will not use without inner ear protection before putting theses on.I based my opinions on 35 years of buying quality products ( before the time that we are forced to ( buy made in china )products.most everything today is poorly made and won't last . These muffs are such an example. I don't feel the need to be an expert in the field of hearing /Audio to give an overall opinion on the low quality manufacturer of this product. suffice it to say you can do better with a good pair of $40 pair of muffs."
2,It's more about Patty than I knew before......,"But not nearly as much as I was hoping to learn. The book is attractive with its many color photographs, but there just isn't much 'meat' to it, I'm afraid. Very disappointing."
1,"Poorly written, unclear and superficial","As with Peatman's other books, this one SEEMS to cover the material at first glance in the bookstore. But then, after the reader purchases the book and gets it home, s/he will find the coverage incomplete and diluted. What do I mean? Specifically, there are no detailed or in-depth examples. The material is abstract and general in nature. For a topic like microcontrollers, the reader needs examples that are ""step-by-step"" and ""how-to"". These are totally lacking. Buy any other book instead. Then you might actually learn something."
3,"It is not ment to be a ""PIC for dummies"" Book","I took Dr. Peatman's class in college with this book, and I think this book would have done better if he had bundled the Class Lab book. The class lab book and actually having the hardware in front of you made the book make a whole lot more sense. I can see how some of the other readers may have been disappointed because with out the hardware in front of you its a bit difficult to really understand whats going on. I think this book is great as a reference if you have a PIC controller to play around with, but I would not recommend this book to some one who is looking for a ""PIC microprocessors for Dummies"" type book."
2,Not Much Bang for the Buck!,"This book is basically an over-priced college text. ... On the other hand, there are a few good practical applications illustrated. The author choose to place a special emphasis on timing issues."
5,Embedded Systems,"So Far I have been using it alot to figure out how to program the assembly for a pic, very useful"
3,NOT ONE OF THEIR BEST,"IF YOU GAVE ""DEEP IN THE HEART..."" AND ""WE HAVE A LIVE ONE..."" FIVE STARS AS I DID, YOU MAY BE AS DISSAPOINTED IN THIS ONE AS I WAS. OBVIOUSLY, WHOEVER SPLICED THIS THING TOGETHER WAS NOT A COMMANDER FAN. THE FIRST CLUE IS THE MISSPELLING OF BILL KIRCHENS LAST NAME OR , DO WE HAVE A NEW MEMBER OF THE BAND? YOU HAVE TO ASSUME BOBBY BLACK IS ON STEEL, BUT HE IS NOT MENTIONED. THE CONTINUITY BETWEEN TUNES IS REALLY DISJOINTED FOR THE MOST PART. COMMUNICATION WITH THE AUDIENCE AND INTRO TO THE TUNES IS SPORATIC AT BEST. ITS ALMOST LIKE A STUDIO SESSION WITH APPLAUSE FADED IN AND OUT WITH LITTLE INTERACTION WITH THE AUDIENCE. THE LAST TUNE, ""JAILHOUSE ROCK"" COMES AFTER THEY HAVE SAID ""BYE BYE"". IT LASTS ABOUT 30 SECONDS AND SOUNDS LIKE AN EXPERIMENT WITH AN ECHO CHAMBER. WHOEVER THREW THIS CD TOGETHER DID A DISSERVICE TO THE COMMANDER AND HIS FANS AND SHOULD HAVE TO LISTEN TO RAP FOR THIRTY DAYS."
3,A prime example of early 90's teen fiction,"I read this book when it first came out. (We are talking 10 years ago, despite the pre-set age thing on this review). Young adult fiction then was a lot different than it is now. Sure it's more than a little shallow but that's what made it so great! It was cheesy and a little ditzy. These girls were all about what they wore, who they wanted to date, and how they were going to make it through the school year. I loved the characters of this book. They were easy, stereotypical and one-dimensional. I know I sound sick but that what was I liked, but it is what I liked BACK THEN. It reminds me of early SVH books and all the fun silliness it used to be. Sure there are probably a hell of lot more interesting and intelligent stories out there to tell, but once upon a time, all this shallowness was at one point the most important stuff in the world. Plus the scheming that Britany did was a trip!"
1,Shallow Barbie-Doll Crap,"There is not even a tiny speck of genuine emotion in this novel. It's all about a bunch of rich and beautiful spoiled teenaged girls competing for the affections of some guy they couldn't really care less about. It is vapid in the extreme and promotes extremely shallow values. Other people with less than supermodel bodies and millionaire bank accounts exist, too, and have much more interesting stories to be told. I find it creepy how the voice of regular people is supressed in favor of idealized cut-outs. I'm not surprised this comes from the creator of the Nancy Drew series, but at least Nancy Drew was doing something useful and interesting with that whole mystery-solving thing."
5,Great lore...,"I think DelNegro is a fabulous storyteller. I enjoy reading Lucy Dove to my daughter's friends, especially at sleepovers...and let's not forget about Oct. 31st! The images Gore illustrated are so beautifully errie. You feel like you have stepped right into this Celtic tale. As both an author and illustrator for children's books, I can truly appreciate the craftmanship that went into this wonderful book. I Hope there will be another retold or original tale, soon? I certainly will be the first in line!"
5,Wonderful!,"My 2nd grade teacher gave me this book when I was transfering to a new school at the start of 3rd grade. Over the years, I read the book over and over again. I feel that it is a great addition to any girl's library. It shows another point of view of pioneer life - other than the Laura Ingalls Wilder one we all know and love."
5,BEST Really is best.,"I have been entering sweeps since forever. Many of the newsletters I subscribed to over the years have, sadly, gone out of business.I like the fact you can save, on line, sweeps you want to enter to a personal file for the enter online sweeps so you can just, literally, go down your own personal enter list.I also like the fact you can get your newsletter both by mail and online.They have even recently added the send in for codes special entry/ instant win sweeps in addition to the skills contests.I have found the versatility of this newsletter VERY helpful and have been winning a lot of sweeps using this newsletter.I grant you they haven't been BIG wins..yet. But have won a nano iPod, a 15 song download, a T-shirt, a recipe box, screen savers, photo albums, gift certificates and what not.Winning even small things is fun. This newsletter helps me do that. I like that. I like that a LOT. I think you will too."
4,Best Sweepstakes Newsletter,It's a very good sweepstakes newsletter. I like entering sweepstakes I only wish I could Win once and a while.
1,Are the 5 star comment people working with Viz?,"I feel like the previous reviews with 5 stars are part of a plot by Viz to improve their ratings... like who would say that it was a good price and/or value. I love this series. I absolutely love it, and if I was offered a deal that I could not consider just a slap in the face, I would buy it. I have to watch it on hulu plus or weird websites that I get viruses from, but I won't buy this again until they start charging appropriate prices."
3,"Great Set/Series, but....","I love the series and have bought every set up to this point, but the aspect ratio disappoints me on this one. From episode 190 onward, these episodes should be in 16:9 format, and why no blu ray? Even the extras for 190+ have widescreen, but they choose to crop to 4:3 for the episodes themselves. Why is this now being produced as though it's 2002? In 2012, just make a 16:9 release in HD."
5,Bleach fan,Love Bleach no matter what. This filler was annoying in parts but this one in particular about the new caption wasn't so bad.
4,good,This set finishes out the new captain filler arc. The last couple of episodes continue the main story but be warned that this is mostly filler. I still enjoyed it anyway.
2,Only one reason to buy this...,"...and thats for the final four episodes on the third disk. These are the only episodes that have anything to do with the Arrancar saga. I dont know whats more disgusting, the awful filler arc (Though still its no where near as bad as The Bount <shudders>)or the fact that I have to pay $30 just for four episodes. I litterally only kept the last disk and threw the first two away.That being said the last four episodes are very good and definately need to be watched before the next set comes out (dont want to spoil anything but major plot points are revealed).In conclusion get this only if you really care about the MAIN story and even then you only need to watch the final disk. And to VIZ please stop screwing us and just release box sets with 20 or more episodes. Funiamtion releases ENTIRE series, 26 episodes or more for less then what Viz charges us for 10!"
2,Amazing show. Horrible value.,The 2 stars is obviously not for the show it self. Its for Viz media and there ridiculous prices for what you get. 1) Its only 3 discs and 13 episodes2) You can't even call it a box set any more. It's just a dvd case with 3 disc inside of it. LAAAAME!!!
3,A Bit Inaccurate,"Beware, this scale weighs you approximately 4-5 pounds more than the scale you are probably using now. Even body fat was extremely high.My normal scale weighed me within 1 pound of my doctor's scale. I wanted the body fat option as well. After stepping off the Tanita and on to my original scale, I immediately lost 5 pounds.Still, the weight tracker is convenient and it looks nice/sturdy."
3,brain surgeon,"i never get a truly acurate weight or bmi with this. and when setting two people to use the scale, it goes through this long button pressing session to change height and other stats. i use it mainly because it's digital and at least i can get an ""average"" idea of my weight and bmi.i've been wanting one of these for years, and finally gave the $80 to get one, so i expected a little more than ""average""."
5,Great value,I was looking for an easy to use measuring device to monitor my weight and body fat. This product works very well for my wife and I. It gave us accurate readings on weight and based on what I have read I think we have fairly accurate results on body fat. Just make sure that it is placed on a hard floor and once you have it set up for two people with their heights (takes 5 seconds) you are good to go. Setting it on a carpet can cause innaccurate readings.Great value for $26.00!
1,This is crappy,YOu are much better off buying the ten dollar model at walmart! The fact that it is digital probably contributes to its ineffectivity. Skip it.
1,very poor accuracy,It does not have an accurat body fat percantage...it says way over what I got tested at the doctor. I wouldn't reccommend it.
4,Good for Beginners,A good book for someone just learning for fun. It doesn't actually have raised dots in it. It is a fun and simple book. Very clear and descriptive. Great for children! Colorful!
1,Hardly Helpful,"I think everyone should take the time to learn to read Braille using and without using sight. However, not with this book. It's a very short book that teaches how to read and recognize Braille by sight, as that is what it is about, but it offers no chances to read braille with you fingertips. It's geared more towards children than adults, and teaches numbers and letters, but the most Braille you can read with your fingers is a poorly embossed alphabet on the back and the title on the front. I would no suggest buying this book. There are much better books out there, and some libraries offer free Braille."
4,Braille for the Sighted,Very good for learning the basic format of Braille. It would be nice if it included pictures of the differenttypes of braille machine key boards.
2,Too many typos,"Too many typos! Be careful; there are several places where the words are wrong or omitted. Also, too overstimulating for my taste."
2,Borderline garbage,"The only ""Braille"" in this book is on the front and back cover. Sure it ""shows"" you the braille, but how do you learn braille without touching it? Hello?"
1,not raised,"the letters are not raised, it is impossible to learn without feeling the words you are reading."
1,Network Analysis and Troubleshooting?,"There might not be a lot of questions regarding network analysis and troubleshooting on the exam. If there is and you buy this e-Book, you might be disappointed.I am not studying for the exam but based on the title I felt that it might help with some basic analysis of IP traffic over a network. However there is little if any assistance on that process.I would more aptly consider this to be titled 'TCP/IP 101 for Dummies'."
5,Professor Lee has done a much needed service to Christology,"Bernard Lee has unhesitatingly placed Jesus squarely within the Jew religious spectrum. The reviewer who faults his emphasis on method is simply wrong in every respect on that point. Without revealing the methodology, a critic exposes his work to the justifiable criticism that his work is sheer speculation or worse propoganda. Whatever we think about the origins of Jesus of Nazareth, his Jewishness like the Irishness of Eamon deValera, the Frenchness of Charles deGaulle and the Britishness of Winston Churchill must be encontered and accounted for if we are to understand him.In bringing Jesus' essential Jewish character into the Christological conversation, Bernard Lee has administered a much needed antidote to supersecessionist Christologies that have led to so much distortion of the image of Jesus. Once encountering the Jesus revealed in Lee's book it should be impossible to use Jesus as a guarantor of First World Political hegemony."
1,Prattling On About What We Don't Know,"Bernard Lee has written a book on a much needed subject. Certainly, he is correct in wanting to explore the Jewishness of Jesus and the implications for the Church today. But, he should have done this. Instead the book is primarily about the process of doing this without ever seriously exploring the subject it talks about exploring.A full third of the book describes the structure of the rest of the book which he then ignores in the rest of the book. I got the distinct impression while reading that Mr. Lee was wanting to explore the subject but never achieved enough of a grasp of the subject to know what he was exploring.Don't waste your money or time."
3,Mixed,"The Piano sound is truly the best sound you can find for even under $1000, and this is only $500.Thats the good news.The other sounds are ok, the organ sounds being the worst, and the electric piano being the best non-piano sounds. The worst part (and the reason i wouldnt buy it again) is the touch. If you plan on just pounding out chords, itll be fine, but if you play classical, jazz, or even most pop-styles that require a bit of touch, you will hate this piano. They say it is ""Hammer-Action"" but really they should be called ""way-over-weighted"". These are the heaviest keys i have ever played, and I wish i would have played it before i bought it online."
3,Good piano sound...but has some problems.,"Initially pleased when I received it.First one I received had problems with a lower ""E"" key not sounding.Also keys in the middle register banging against the case when returningup. I returned the first one and received a replacement.Everything was good for a while, but then it would go into different voices or demo mode while playing. Also developed a problem with keys notmuting after being played, and would continue sounding until struck again.The action on this piano also is very heavy, and aftery playing a few hours, you definitely will feel it. Also the octave above middle ""C"" issomewhat tinny. But it does have a good sound for the money. The qualitycontrol on this product could be improved."
2,"I can't get past ""Crazy Bitch"", is that okay?","Fighting. Drinking. Screwing. Cursing. Drugs. Buckcherry.The sound of the album is awesome. The production is slick, and Jason Todd puts the usual sh*tload of energy into his performance. Good rock. The first track rules, and the last track really f*ckin' rules. The middle tracks have some great moments in them too.That's all fine, but. . . .I don't know, that song ""Crazy Bitch"" is just too much for even me. Its too much. I never want to hear that song again. It put a big ol' freakin' sh*t-stain on the whole thing for me. I feel pretty guilty even saying that, but that's how I feel.But, whatever. I'm just one dude. The album is cool. Rock n roll. Check it out if you're curious. Buy it if you like rock. ""Crazy Bitch,"" though. . . . . .I dunno."
2,Where's the creativity?,"Of all the words in the dictionary to choose from in an effort to write songs with. We get to enjoy the verbal scenes from ""shock rock 101"". Hmm, ok?"
5,Must have album of 2006,"BUCKCHERRY IS BACK!!!What a return for the L.A. based rockers. They recorded this album in only 15 days (given the title.) Josh Todd sounds better than ever on the vocals. Keith Nelson and Stevie D really pound out some amazing solo's and riffs. The other two new members of the band Xavier (on drums) and Jimmy Ashhurst (bass) really finish this band to help make it better than ever.NOTE: The extra tracks ""BACK IN THE DAY"" & ""PUMP IT UP"" will not be on the U.S. release.Stand Out Tracks:Next 2 You (single)Crazy Bitch (single)EverythingSorry"
4,Now can I stop pretending I like JT's solo caca?,"Immediately liked it better than Time Bomb, though not quite as nasty as the debut. Initially discouraged by early ""maturing"" and ""growing as artists"" reviews (denial for ""mellowed"" and ""perhaps I can LEARN to like it""), ONE FIVE is mostly sick.""So Far,"" ""Out of Line,"" ""Onset,"" ""Broken Glass""... this is the same filthy Friday night \m/_ _\m/ we blasted in high school, minus the sissy poses. Back before Seattle decided we weren't adequately depressed, and Axl, well, he was just mad. Not cuckoo.B u c k c h e r r y . It's about f'n time.""Crazy Bitch"" is trash classic. I'd be happier with fewer heart-tuggers, but I realize they're maturing and growing as artists. Treat yourself: See 'em live. Josh is THE rock star. Unashamed, O.G. gutter punk. And, get this, dude tattooed his liver!Not really. But Keith is cooler than Fonzie AND Miles Davis, now what?4 stars. 5 if they'd covered DC's ""Problem Child"" instead."
3,"Cool throwback CD, check out the Fozzy like the other reviews mention","Nice throwback sound...mix of Aerosmith and Guns....with a bit of Modern Twist...I'd recomend as other reviewers have also, the new Fozzy All That Remains Reloaded CD....amazing CD that everyone should ownAll That Remains Reloaded (W/Dvd)"
4,Awesome CD for Buckcherry,It took me a couple of time listening to t his CD before I could make the decision as to whether I liked it or not. But the more I listen to it the better I like it. It's raunchy but well worth the money. Good Classic Rock! I would recommend this to anyone that likes rock and roll!
5,Hopefully It Happens,"Hopefully Buckcherry gets the respect and the recognition that they so rightfully deserve. This is my favorite buckcherry cd, not to say I didn't love the other 2. I also thoroughly enjoyed JT's solo cd, though i would give it 4 stars. But fifteen is AWESOME, i do not skip through one song and i can't say that for the other 3 cd's. All i hope for is that people start to notice how freakin good these guys are. We need to appreciate this rock and roll for what it is, music that makes your head move. Ever song is great, of course crazy b%#%& being the best. But Next to You is a close 2nd. Brooklyn is the only song i'm not crazy about, but hopefully this cd will sell 5 million copy's when its released in april, they deserve it. Rock on Buckcherry!!! Don't Stop Now!!! God Bless!!!"
5,Best Buckcherry record to date...,"Unlike their previous two albums (which were also amazing), 15 is very diverse. Slow songs mixed with heavy songs and songs that have a combination of instruments you probably wouldn't expect from Buckcherry (like slide guitars and even an orchestra). Josh and Keith have surrounded themselves with great musicians in Xavier, Stevie and Jimmy. Josh's vocals have never sounded better and Keith's guitar playing has not only gotten better but more technical and, again, diverse. This band sounds refreshed and ready to save rock n roll.15 is a nice combination of AC/DC-Black Crowes-old Aerosmith, and yet they never lost their ""Buckcherry"" sound. This record came out at a good time...warm weather time...so, roll down your windows, turn the volume knob to 10 and rock this album."
4,AMAZING,"THE THIRD BUCKCHERRY ALBUM IS FINALLY HERE, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE THE DAY. AFTER JOSH TODD'S SOLO RECORD I WAS A LITTLE DOUBTFUL BUT THEY PULLED THROUGH BIG TIME. THIS ALBUM HAS THE CLASSIC BUCK CHERRY SOUND WITH A LITTLE MATURITY AND A BALLAD OR TO MIXED IN. ALONG WITH THE CLASSIC RIFFS THEIR ARE SOME TUNES THAT ALOMOST SOUND LIKE SOUTHERN ROCK (NEXT 2 U) AND THATS OKAY. BASICALLY AN AMAZING RECORD AND IF THEY PUT IT OUT IN THE U.S. PROMOTE AND TOUR THE RIGHT WAY THEY WILL BE BACK ON TOP OF THE HARD ROCK CHARTS IN NO TIME. BEST SONGS ON THE RECORD CRAZY BITCH, CAROUSEL, NEXT2U"
4,Old School....put the G back in the R,"Really strong at some points....you will play the CD non-stop on some of the select tracks like Crazy B*** and Sorry. Some filler, but everybody has some filler these days. If you like this, but want it a tad bit heavier...get the new Fozzy CD/DVD All That Remains Reloaded......no filler on that, great singing by the WWE wrestling guy, Chris Jericho."
5,Wonderful Album,"I bought this album for my wife. She hasn't listened to a CD this much in the past 5 years. It is a wonderful mix of Aerosmith, Finger Eleven, and Eve 6. Great music I actually enjoy."
5,15 ROCKS ! ! !,Buckcherry knows how to rock! 15 is Buckcherrys third CD & definately their best! In the five years between albums Buckcherry removed & replaced three members of the band which ofcourse makes them sound a lot different. If you did not like Buckcherry before I strongly recommend you try listening to this CD. The album is a mixture of alternative & metal. It has a lot of great ballads & awesome tracks like crazy b**** & sorry. 15 is one of a kind & I highly recommend it. It's great to buy a CD that you like every song on and that is why you should buy Buckcherry 15.
4,classic cock rawk schtick,"Despite the haters and non-believers, Buckcherry have proven themselves a popular and hard rocking band with crass commercial appeal. Singer Josh Todd belts & screeches out an obvious amalgam of Aerosmith & AC/DC cliches with all the traditional anti-intellectual fervor of an 80's hair metal misogynist anonymous meeting, but so fk'n what? If you can't handle the truth, get lost and go download yourself some more typically sad sack indie rock fare found all over the web. This one's aimed for the parking lot purists & pukers, beer drinkers & hellraisers in the cheap seats that yo mamma warned ya about. Turn this one way up, or get the f*k outta the way ye wimp rock wallowers. Crazy classic cock rawk schtick ...if the bitrate was higher, you could smell the sweat, smoke & the dripping teen twatz..."
2,Mostly forgettable,"What exactly is so outstanding about this album? Comparisons with Aerosmith only work if you mean lame efforts like ""Pump"". GNR? No, GNR had solid lyrics and actual musicians. Give this a year and it will be on the penny CD list. Except people will still be downloading 'Crazy Bitch' the album's saving grace and a regular for cover bands at bars everywhere. Speaking of bar bands, I know several that put Buckcherry to shame. Glad 15 days is paying off for them, but wait another 15 before you buy it."
4,This is a great album!,"I would have given this album 5 stars but I believe that's for classics like: Led Zep 4, Appetite For Destruction, Van Halen's first album, and Back In Black etc... But, this is a great record! Its nice to see that there are still a few bands out there that have the goods! And, that are not ashamed to admit that they make heavy rock and roll. The fact that this record has sold 1 million copies (with just little support from their label)by heavy touring and word of mouth should make music executives stop and think! Everyone I have played it for (if they like rock or not) wanted to buy it after they heard it!"
4,Buckcherry 15,"This review written by Mr. Bradberry's students:Buckcherry is back with 15. It's been 5 years and 3 band members later, but there back. 15 isn't hardcore or something that no one will understand. But it's a good album. I think that Crazy Bitch is probably one of there most listened to song ever.Buckcherry is a band that doesn't disapoint people. From Sorry to Crazy Bitch everyone has a song of Buckcherry that they like. With there live album Butterfly there hits just keep on a commin.Buckcherry is a great band, every album has it's good songs and bad songs. From TimeBomb to Butterfly, I hope they stay together for a while so we can hear some more hits. So heres to you Buckcherry!**** stars."
4,Rizlahead on Buckcherry's 15,"This is the first of Buckcherry for me and I wasn't disappointed. Very non-PC with tracks like Crazy Bitch but Out Of Line has to be my favorite on 15. I'm, unfortunately, nearer 50 than 15 and enjoyed all the tracks. Looking forward to more Buckcherry."
2,Not good for a pure beginner,"This book does a decent job of describing stuff. On the other hand, this book does not really describe (in detail) the hands on experience you need and does not bode well with real world programming practices."
2,Couldn't be more wrong,"I am so surprised to see all of these glowing reviews! The book is pretty good, but the DVD is terrible!! Despite a serious concern for whether or not yoga is compatible with my deeply held beliefs, I am returning to an Elena Brower dvd I once borrowed from a friend, because, despite the lack of Christian music in the background, it makes me feel closer to God and more at peace.Perhaps one reason I did not like the dvd very much is because it is NOT FOR BEGINNERS!! The easier poses are so easy it makes the practice useless (at least for a healthy 20 year old) but the harder ones are much harder than those on other beginner dvds. The workout makes me feel stressed out, miserable and incompetent. I highly recommend Elena Brower, just be sure to turn her off before her ending ""prayer""!"
5,Awesome,"Thanks, I love watching this over and over. I rated it a five because I really love watching wwe. It's one of my favorite things to watch besides NCIS."
5,wwe best matches 2011,Everything with this transaction was good. And I purchased this for my grandson for an Easter gift. He just loves wrestling.He just loved the video.
2,Bad Experience,"I was only able to watch the first disc, which was pretty good. The second one had what I think is a manufacturer's defect in that it produced a message stating ""Playback feature may not be enabled on this disc."" I sent it back to Amazon for a replacement. When the replacement arrived I got the same message on the same disc. I sent that one back as well and apprised Amazon of the problem. Amazon is looking into the issue, but I would wait before ordering."
4,Good Chapters - Edited by a good thinker,"I confess I'm a weekly reader who appreciates the author's take on all things investing. Some excellent chapters in this book, some just pretty good. overall very much worth the read"
1,Don't waste your money,"I keep trying to read this book but am bored to death after each chapter hoping the next chapter will be better. If you are looking for info to help improve your trading abilities then this is not the book. I walk away with no clearcut strategies. This book continuously beats around the bush in my humble opinion. Sorry, I think there are many other better books out there."
4,A good collection of Ideas.,"Its a bit of a grab-bag, but that is kind of fun too. I would probably not have read some of these things had they not been put in this collection.This is a really easy book to read by the way. It is not some very dry, quant oriented book. But is a lively, entertaining, and often funny collection of wisdom and insight. It is well worth the money and time."
4,Another winner by John Mauldin,"Another great book by Mauldin. A couple of the chapters are dry and do not offer as much insight as the others. But, all in all it is well worth reading for those who invest or those who help people invest."
3,12 diverse essays with even more diverse value/quality,"If you compare this book directly with Market Wizards I & II, you will definitely be very disappointed. However, if the presence of 2 or 3 very bright ideas in one single book can already satisfy you well, you may still give it a try. IMHO, the chapters by Andy Kessler (lower cost creates its own huge market), Dennis Gartman (12 trading rules) and Gary Shilling (the long bull market of long bonds) are outstanding, whilst the rest are just so so or even substandard. Sorry to say that there are many better alternatives in the market of the ""various authors"" genre. On the other hand, ""Wall Street Meat"" and ""Running Money"", two books by Andy Kessler alone, are much better and interesting than this. In short, not recommended.Below please find my most favorite saying in the whole book:-Change is like a train. It can either run over you, or you can catch it to the future. pg 219"
1,A waste of time!,"John Mauldin is a very bright man, who seems to have run out of ideas to write about. Most of the chapters in this book seem to be a rehash of things from his previous book, ""Bull's Eye Investing"" or discussions from his website. Had his earlier work not been so good, this book may not have been such a appointment."
1,Bore Me To Tears,"Unless you enjoy reading dry, academic dribble, hour after hour, save your money.The points made in this book could have been summed up on a page or two.Easily, the most boring book on investing I've ever tried to read."
1,Weak book from a overrated self-promoter. Do not buy.,"This book is very weak.First, the author has had a horrible year since the stock market is flat and once again has decided to make his customers buy more books so he can pay for his fancy European suits. If he wanted you to learn anything in this book, he would not write it, otherwise you would not need his money manager's services. The content is weak and unfortunately I was being honest by trying to save YOU money.One more thing: the author recently said that his new book is #2 bestseller after Oprah's books.I cannot help but tell you: He lies and he knows how to do it with a straight face."
3,Moments of Brilliance but not as good as his other work,"A short synopsis - the family patriarch returns to Israel from America to seek a divorce from his estranged, and institionalized wife who is living in an institution. Along the way in a James Joyce-like fashion, we hear from each key character in the family dynamic. The young grandson, the son, the beautiful daughter-in-law, the son-in-law, the daughter, and of course the patriarch and his wife themselves.Some of the chapters are absolutely inspired, electric, and brilliant. Others are weaker and more tiresome. This is at its core a book about family and its dynamics, not about Israel. Those looking for insight into Israeli society should try Yehoshua's brilliant novel, The Lover.For hardcore Yehoshua fans, this is a must read, others would do better looking elsewhere."
1,Could have been a booklet rather than a book,"The topic of becoming an SAP consultant has been so over-exploited in the past several years in newsgroups and chat rooms. Now, the authors have done the same thing in their book. The SAP market has shrunk tremendously in the past 12 mos. Launching yourself into the SAP world now is like closing the barn door after the horse is a mile down the road. On content, the book is filled with fluff. As other reviewers have pointed out, all the stuff in this book is freely available elsewhere. Pass on this one."
1,Useful only to novices at both SAP and Consulting,"For anyone who has been in this business very long, you'll already know everything in here. Many pages are even wasted on re-printing information from FREE IRS publications. Why pay for that? The authors also left out some important stuff, like disability insurance and professional liability insurance."
5,"Tell us more, Michael...","Michael Talaga's story is very interesting and very readable. Once I started it, I finished it in a couple of days--I didn't want to stop reading! As you read, you feel like you know Michael, likable at times, not so likable at others, but always honest and transparent about his life. His story about growing up Catholic, thinking that he knew all about God, to really coming to know God, is funny, warm, touching.... Read for yourself!"
2,Sad...,"I found Talaga's book interesting and engaging, but it also saddened me to read it. As God was calling him into a more intimate relationship, Talaga obviously misunderstood the calling and became Protestant. He also has many grave misunderstandings about Catholic theology and doctrine, as many Christians do. As the late Bishop Fulton Sheen said, ""Not 100 in the United States hate the Roman Catholic Church, but millions hate what they mistakenly think that the Roman Catholic Church is.""Too bad Talaga turned his back on the church Christ established. I'll be praying that he comes home."
4,"A decent compilations of the early years, with A DVD classic from the 80's","Now that Amazon has this set affordable online, you get the 2 CD's and DVD for about just a couple of bucks more than the DVD. Kiss exposed is a great DVD put together in 1987 just after the asylum album and before Crazy nights, and has a great compilation of videos and vintage footage of the original band live. The CD set is a greatest hits of the music up to the Creatures of the night release in 1982 (ie I love it loud and War machine are not on this set). Hopefully, they might release a second set of Kiss gold to cover 1982 on...although I thought they would have done that by now. I guess you can always get the 3 20th century masters Kiss CD's which cover all the year to go with this set as well. Anyway, If you want the music only, buy the 2cd set. But, for just a few bucks more, get this DVD edition if your a kiss fan."
4,Am I the only one?,"I'm not a huge KISS fan, but I like to dabble and this seemed like a hard bargain to pass up. Anyway, what's up with some of the mixes on this disc? The drums seemed to be buried most of the time. And since when were there drums in the beginning of Hard Luck Woman? Then the oddly loud hi-hat hit when the drums normally come in. Calling Dr. Love is missing the cool backwards guitar noise that makes the song. I don't know I'm confused. Some of the mixes sound good and then other ones sound odd. You do get a lot of bang for your buck with this one, but there are some things that dissapointed me."
3,Another best of ?,"One thing that was particularly exciting about being a Kiss fan,was the new albums and seeing how the new songs fit into the stage show.While there is some great songs here,how many more ""Best Of's"" do we get.If you have been a Kiss fan for as long as i have (1976),no doubt you would already have these songs.If you are a younger fan and dont have these songs,get it for sure because its great value for money.But for us older fans,we have heard it all before."
5,KISS at their Best,"If you are a KISS fan then the Gold album is a must-buy. This 2 disc, 40 song set features all the best hits from KISS from 1974-1982. The first disc illustrates the best KISS music with the highlights being: Deuce, Strutter, nothin' to lose, and of course the powerful, yet touching ballad, ""BETH"". It also features 4 live tracks on disc 1 which include ""Rock and Roll all nite"". Although the 2nd disc isn't quite as strong it still features 2 impressive live hits and also features classics like: ""calling dr. love"", ""hard luck woman"" and ""I was made for lovin' you"". This album illustrates the KISS's pure embodiement of rock n' roll in their early days. If you're new to KISS, this is the perfect purchase for you, and if you're a loyal fan it's nice to have all the greatest hits from KISS on 2 discs."
4,Very Good Compilation,"This is one of the better compilations I've seen put together by any group, and definitely the best KISS compilation. I would change only a few things about this cd- I would use studio versions of all the live tracks (Rock Bottom, Cold Gin, Rock 'n' Roll All Nite, Let Me Go Rock 'n' Roll, Making Love, God of Thunder), with the exception of Rock 'n' Roll All Nite; I would include 100,000 Years; and I would have left off the last 2 or 3 songs (they feel like a totally different style than the rest of the album). But this is a near perfect compilation of the peak years of KISS. I'd like to see another Gold cd which covered the 80's and 90's (which is where the last three tracks on this one belong).This album is definitely worth buying."
3,Best Compilation,"I gave this 3 1/2 stars, not because I think Kiss is so great, but because this is the best compilation of all of their music that matters. It has all of their 70's classic rockers and some of their 80s pop.If you don't own any Kiss, this is ALL you need, trust me. Anything after 82 was just..........well let's just say other people did it better............stay far away from Psycho Cirus"
5,Looks so cute,"This is a splurge item of course! I can't say that it serves any magical purpose like the french oven, but it looks adorable on my countertop and is a great addition to a growing collection of LC. I currently use it for salt, but I can't wait to use it on the table for a dip when we have dinner guests."
1,Useless and outdated,"I purchased this pamphlet (not enough pages for a book) in 12/2004. It is a list of the course requirements with a very brief blurb after each one. It tries to expand on this by listing relevant web sites. Most of the links didn't work and the ones that did weren't very useful. Unfortunately, there is no reasonably priced study guide for this exam. Save your money."
4,No America's Cup,"If you want a book on how to build the next America's Cup winner this book is not for you. However, if you want a good book on building a good reliable cruising boat then step on up. This book is written for the average person on building a cruiser. It explains everything in everyday language from lofting on up. One of these boats will never win America's cup but you could definitely see one sitting in the Gulf of Mexico or the Virgin Islands enjoying a tall one."
5,Backyard Boat Building,"As always, George Buehler is a pleasure to read. From reading his other works, I know George likes metals as well as wood -- but he clearly loves wood, and this book is reflects that. While I'm planning to build in metal, the book is full of insights and useful information for all boatbuilders. On top of that, it's full of the common sense stories on material selection that every boatbuilder or restorer needs -- at least those of us who have any budget limitations."
5,Backyard Boatbuilding,I am a new hobbyist in the boatbuilding field and this book was very informative. The tips of preparing your building area was very good and easy to interpret. Several plans for boats were also a part of the text.
5,hardwork?,"A lot of activities of man are steeped in protocol. Us men tend to add ego to everything. I once had a flying instructor who questioned the 'norm' and rejected the unecessary -flying instantly became easier and enjoyable. When you question this 'unecessary difficulty' the world opens up. George Buehler's book, as well as being humourous and educational, de-programs what you thought you knew about boats and illustrates most people's ability to regurgitate yacht marketing drivel."
5,"Keep It Simple, Stupid","I have read several books which presume to instruct the reader in boatbuiling. Buehler's book was one of the first I read and remains, in my humble opinion, to be the best. His no-nonsense style and ""heretical"" opinions offer a pleasant counterpoint to those individuals who would have one believe that one steam-bent oak frames and mahagony rubrails (each with 10 coats of the finest marine varnish...) are necessities for the construction and enjoyment of a sailing craft.Having built three small, simple boat projects, I read this book and, by Chapter 7, was muttering, ""I could DO this!"" I highly recommend it, even if the reader only builds a rowboat."
5,The Essential starting place for any Masonic research,"An amazing collection of facts, stories, biographies, theories, and not a few myths all relating to Freemasonry. If you are interested in the subject, you will find each entry to be informative, and perhaps even entertaining. You never know what nugget you will find next as you go through it.This encyclopedia was originally written in the late 1800's and went through several revisions during the first half of the 20th century. This Kessinger reprint appears to be a facimile of the 1920's version. As with most Kessinger reprints it is essentially a bound xerox kind of quality, which is suitable for a ""working"" copy. This also is the only version still in print. Those buyers with patience can frequently find old originals with their ornate bindings and color plates at auction web sites (including Amazon's) in the fifty to one hundred dollar price range."
3,halloween costume,"This was for my son, It was good for the halloween carnival. I forgot what year I got this, thank You."
2,Cheaply made,Mask broke same day I bought it .. shirt was filmy and cheap . I was very upset . It was on time but that's all .
1,freddy kuegler review,"I purchased this after reading all the bad reviews so i was nervous. I do believe that it is very cheaply made, and without the other accessories the costume would not work. After all is said and done the costume is going to work for us this year but the picture i posted is a more accurate photo of actual costume."
1,poor product ... you show a product and received a diferent,"We saw the picture of the custome in the computer, even in the box when we received and it is not the same ... different quality ..... I feel like they cheat me."
2,grammy d 53,The mask is very poorly made out of super cheap material. The costume is okay. The mask tore away from the elastic band behind my grandson's head the first day he played with it. There is no educational value to this toy which is what we expected.
1,Confused & Disappointed,The order stated that this was a Tibetan Phrasebook: paperback and 144 pages. I received the order today and it was two cassette tapes. No book included. Is the book on the way???
5,A must have for cell phone owners!!!,"This product works perfectly well on my computer, and it was almost free. How can you complain? It is great being able to make your own ringtones and wallpapers for your cell."
3,Mobile tools,The program loads fine. occationally it has a glich and does not work. Just have to unload and load it again. over all it does it's job. Even when you unload the software the system holds all the info from the phone and the system to the phone.
1,It's up to you..,"Well the Motorola Phone Tools cd worked great but the usb cable was a total dud. I tried 2 different phones and 2 different computers to make sure it was not my phone or computer that was messed up. Indeed it was the cable that would not work. I borrowed a cable from a friend and it worked great and I was able to use the cd just fine. So, if you want to press your luck on the usb cable, go ahead but it didn't work for me at all. But like I said, the Motorola Phone Tools cd worked great...if you can borrow someone else's cable to use it with. It may not have cost me alot but I expected it to work. I'm not trying to talk bad about the seller though. Maybe it was just 1 cable in 1000 that just didn't happen to work. Anyway..there you have it."
2,THIS DOES NOT WORK,"OKAY, i just received this today. I installed it and everything, and i uploaded the pics from my phone to my computer, it was cool. When I open the program now, the multimedia icon ISNT EVEN THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! does anyone know how to fix this?!?!"
1,Dog's breakfast!,"This software is complete waste of money. It is slow, the fields don't sync properly, it doesn't connect with the phone most of the time, the calendar doesn't work - the list goes on. There is other PC sync software that does the trick for fraction of the price. If you are a Mac OS X user, you are in luck - Apple's active sync allows you to choose your phone model, and syncs the phone fields beautifully for free! At the end I even got rid of my Motorola and switched back to Nokia - their FREE PC Suite software gives complete PDA functionality to any Nokia phone. Shame on Motorola's software developers!"
2,It won't configure can't find drivers,"I have a Razr V3M which is the Verizon Razr, the software will not configure for this phone. I tried the generic V3 drivers and it just hangs. I'm a technical person, I know how to install and configure software, I just can't make this work at all."
1,"If you are verizon customer, don't buy this software","If you are verizon customer, don't buy this software. I bought one to transfer multimedia files between my cell phone and computer. I found that Verizon has disabled such function after installation. I haven't heard anything about it either from Motorola or Verizon. Very disappointing experience...So let me repeat.If you are verizon customer, don't buy this software"
3,useful,I am a cingular customer and I like this product. It is great for transfering pictures from the phone to the computer and vice versa. I've had no problems yet.
3,Motorola Phone Tools 3.0,This tool is quite handy for using on a Motorola phone. I recomend geeting a higher version such as Motorola 4.0.3.0 can be upgraded with it's web site but the 4.0 has both cables for greater access of Motorola phones.Make sure to load up all the software updates from their website after installing the program.
5,It works.,Good program. Good price. On time delivery. Didn't have to use gas and waste time going to the store to pick it up.
1,Zero Stars,"The product allegedly allowed transfer of images and sound between a windows pc and a motorola cell phone (specifically the V3 RAZR), the software would recognize the phone (so I guess the cable worked), but beyond telling me there was a cell phone at the other end of the cable, it did nothing at all.It was not worth the cost to return (It cost more to return than the item cost).I would not recommend this product."
1,Not what i expected,The product only lets you add music and pictures and take them off. No personal use retreaved!!
3,Sure it's great but didn't work with my i465,"Motorola Clutch i465- micro, not mini, my mistake. Even after getting a micro USB cable the only way I could get any files on or off was with a Bluetooth dongle. No Cable and Moto Phone Tools aren't compatable. But I'm sure the product works well with the correct phone."
1,Don't recommend it,"Bought this product and it work for one day, the disc didn't read and the wires were not of good quality"
3,Just for saving info,This product is OK if you just want to save contacts and pictures from your cell phone but it doesn't allow you edit MP3 songs for ringtones to download to your phone.
2,phone tools....,"me and my brother have the same version of the motorola razor phone, but he has verizon...and it doesnt work for his phone!!!we were very dissapointed.i am not sure if it was the softwear, or the verizon service....but it didnt work for him."
5,Motorola Mobile Phone Tools,"Installed easily. Including the mini-A USB cable with the software was a nice touch. Provided a simple interface to manipulate ringtones, photos, and to synchronize calendar and contacts."
1,Low quality software and not the latest version,"We tried several times to install this software on an Windows XP system with no success. It would hang up during the install process and simply stop. For support, Motorola passes you on to the SW manufacturer, BVRP, whose site is of little use. On top of everything, this is a down level version (3.0) and not the latest version (4.0). I wasted some $8 on shipping, handling, and return shipping; don't waste your own money."
3,Nice looking but a little thin on the features,"The phone look of the software is cool and everything, but the features could be a little more robust. I would think that editing simple entries on my phone would be a little more helpful, with speed dial, an option to store on the phone or the sim chip, just like in the phone itself...."
4,Just what I wanted,"It is very easy to use and allows you to copy videos, pictures, and music. It will not work with Windows X64."
1,No zero star?,"This program is worthless. It conflicts with Office 2003, and Acronis True Image. After installation I could not enter my Outlook inbox (I was terrified for a minute). The Live Update feature is slow, and hangs quite often (I'm talk blue screen here). I could not get the program to update after many attempts, and it did not work correctly with my L6. Many features are disabled through phone providers. Others do not work with certain phones. The GUI is very unprofessional, just like the rest of the product. This product is a gimmick. I paid $3 for it, and returned it. Its that bad."
1,Motorola razr v3,"It did not work for my phone. I Loaded the software to my laptop, and connected my phone the software, it did not connect to my phone."
3,Flat and uninspiring,"In spite of great technical prowess and a few beautiful moments I find the set flat and uninspiring. As to the details, why should I repeat? Just read what Ravi wrote. He says it all and right."
2,Tempi inapt in places.,"There are quite a number of pieces in this set that pissed me off, so I have resorted to Pires and Eschenbach's sets, and would gladly report that I do not regret switching my hearing, since this set from Uchida have been sitting on my shelves for years without my returning to it.What's wrong with Uchida's Mozart sonatas?To me, they sound quite mechanic, with a great emphasis being laid on the tempi and speed at the expense of the music itself.Then is Uchida really virtuosic, since she plays these in such great speed?Not really, as judged here. She is neither nuanced nor necessarily flashy, as did Gulda in his more recent release of Mozart's sonatas. Added to the fact that there is an overriding feeling that the piansit hasn't really 'warmed up' to those pieces. May be this is the problem with Uchida at that stage of her performance career. I don't know"
5,Still the leader of the pack,"Although I have several single discs by Kempff, Haskil, Gilels, etc. that I prefer, this is the best complete set that I've heard, closely followed by Klara Wurtz on Brilliant (Wurtz also has an excellent set of Schumann on the same label). As for the complaints about the sound on this set, don't forget that these are early digital recordings and the sound is typical of Philips during the 80's. I, personally, don't have a major problem with it, although it's far from perfect. All things considered, this is a top notch set."
3,Sounds A Bit Mechanical & Souless To Me Also,"After recently purchasing & playing this set, my feeling was that there was little to no emotion in her playing & while technically proficient was boring me to tears. As I'm not an expert on classical music (other then knowing what I like; I also recently purchased a Martha Argerich solo piano box I enjoyed quite a bit), I was curious to read other reviews here & see if it was just me. I noticed while my views are in the minority, that 2 other reviewers felt similarly about this release. Ok, it isn't just me, though it's interesting that there is such polarization with this set!Also a warning, the cd's are in cardboard sleeves, & the sleeves are so tight that there isn't room inside them for a rice paper innersleeve."
3,This Is Not Walden,"This is not ""Walden"". Although some of the writing is very similar (especially to the ""Economy"" section of ""Walden""), this book is too grating. For several pages, I find myself nodding my head in agreement. But, the short barbed attacks become too frequent and too spiteful to hold a lot of water.It becomes more clear why some consider Thoreau hypocritical, although I do not (entirely) agree. However, this book would seem to paint him that way. For example, he complains that it is amazing how many people spend time to gossip about Mr. X when he wouldn't go around the corner to see the world explode. Well, how did he know of the gossip of Mr. X without having spent time on it. Not only that, he ""wasted"" time writing about it. Not only that, we spend time 150 years later reading about it!Don't bother with this book -- read ""Walden"" instead."
1,Easily the worst metal album ever released.,"I will invite you to watch some of the song videos of this album, search up for Frantic, St.Anger and Some Kind of Monster. If you know how to appreciate real, good, classic metal, your ears will bleed.Whoever thought this album was in need of a special edition certainly did not listen the album itself. It sucks, it's terrible; Loud as hell, there's no musical patterns, the instruments sound awful, specially the drums. And the compositions are those of a 10 year old that thinks he can do music. Easily the worst metal album ever released. EVER."
5,It Grows on ya,It took me about 5 listens to get it. Give this one a chance and It will be one of your favorites. The People who diss this album should go back to their singy three chord punk rock songs about skateboarding or whatever.. I for one will Stick with METALLICA. St. Anger is my 2nd Favorite Metallica CD just under the Black Album.
2,Not good for very cold climates!,"I bought this because another reviewer mentioned it does not crack in the cold - apparently their definition of ""cold"" is different from mine! This tie out did not survive one month just sitting on the ground. We got it for a 150 lb. puppy and we tied him out for a few minutes *occasionally* to let him do his business when it's cold out (below zero). We've used this only a few times for several minutes at a time (always supervised, so no he did not chew on it) and the transparent coating on it has cracked once the temperature fell below zero. If you live someplace warm you probably won't have this problem, but if you live in an area where sub-zero temperatures are common you won't have this for very long. Since it is cracked I know it's too weak now to hold my dog so I can't use it. In all honesty the ""large"" size $4 tie outs at a large retailer that I can't stand are the same quality, and I actually had one that lasted me 2 years. This one was a waste of money."
3,Ok for general knowledge,The video was ok for medical staff where you needed just a brief description. The video is only 20 mins. and a rubber teaching device is used. The person in video (massager) appears in a big hurry
1,"Nice try, not!","First off I'm a huge fan of the Dog Whisperer. I the first 3 complete seasons of the show and every book the Cesar has written. That being said I think it a totally rip-off the way season 4 is being released. I don't want volume one, I want the complete season. I don't know who came up with this idea, but it's a bad one. Get back to me when the complete season is released."
4,Why Only Half a Season?,I am a big fan of the Dog Whisperer Series and had purchased the previous 3 seasons. I was disappointed to see that they have spit the 4th season into 2 volumes. Seems to me the producers are taking advantage of its popularity to gouge the fans. Each season has about the same number of episodes so there is no reason to spit it into two and charge double- except greed.
5,"Dog Whisperer with Cesar Millan: Season 4, Vol. 1","In my opinion, can't go wrong with Cesar Millan. Have admired him and his abilities from the very beginning. Would highly recommend anything from The Dog Whisperer!"
4,Alta California history from women's perspective,"A great collection of newly translated transcriptions from a generation of women who witnessed dramatic events in California's history. Included is a several page narrative of my great, great, great, great, grandmother, Juana Machado."
3,Yay for strong women,"So far, I think this may the best book of this series that I've read. I find that Buckley's depiction of Elizabethan England highly compelling and non-obtrusive. This particular novel in the series indulges in far more personal emotion on the part of the heroine which makes it better than the other novel's of her's that I've read.I think this is a fabulous book for anyone who wants to read about a strong heroine who manages to maintain her femininityThe construction of the mystery was excellent and provided enough clues for the reader to be able to solve the mystery even if it was still guilty of not providing the reader the same clues as the heroine. Still, I enjoyed it and recommend it as a light read."
3,it is what it is,"The book was in ok shape. I guess I expected something better. The clear covering was peeling off of it and I do not recall this being mentioned in the description which was kinda a pain when I took this book to my appointments with my surgeon because the book kept ""sticking"" to my other papers.I guess sometimes you get what you pay for.However, the information contained in this book was a huge help in preparing for surgery and has been a blessing post-surgery. I would highly recommend the book if you are having any kind of bariatric surgery."
3,Time for an updated version,"I purchased this book due to a requirement from my Doctor. Although I had already read most of the information from other publications, there is still alot of usueful information in this book. Although it does need to be revised/updated. Some of the facts are very old and or no longer issues with the new surgeries."
4,Really helpful book,"This book was very helpful and was in easy-to-understand text. Sometimes health books can get too technical but this was in every day words. The only problem I had with it was it was published in 2001, so it is a little outdated."
3,Too sheer,"I bought this in search of a perfect nude color, but it is way too sheer. I applied 4 coats of the product on and I can still see my nail lines. Over than that, application was great."
5,Love the color!,"The color is gorgeous, perfect to wear with anything and everything. It is the quintessential neural. Buy it. Love it."
5,Wonderful love story,"I have never been so shocked in my life. This is such a sad book, but I loved it very much. After you have read this book others just don't seem to add up. I recommend that anyone who thinks they have a terrible life should read this book and see how they feel. After reading this book, I found that the things in life I thought were so iportant just don't matter anymore"
4,ONE of the TWO Tina Turner MUST-HAVE DVDs for her fans,"This is one of the two Tina Turner MUST-HAVE DVDs for her fans. The other is Tina Turner: Live In Amsterdam/One Last Time (2 DVD Set).- The sound is not of very good quality compared to other well-recorded DVDs of other bands. Therefore, it can't be rated 5 stars.- The video quality looks faded but I can let it pass. It does not bother me much.- The songs sound exciting. They make me want to dance.This set contains 21 tracks. ""What's Love Got To Do With It"" has 2 versions. Eleven of them ARE NOT INCLUDED in the other DVD set. They're listed below:Be tenderBreak every ruleI don't want to lose youIt takes twoForeign affairLook me in the heartLove thingSteamy windowsTonightTypical male.What you get is what you seeThe 9 tracks that are repeated in the other DVD are listed belowAddicted To LoveBetter Be Good To MeI Can't Stand the rain.Let's Stay TogetherNutbush City LimitsPrivate DancerThe BestWe Don't Need Another HeroWhat's Love Got To Do With It"
3,Update please !!!,"Please update this release with her later hits. That she changed labels in the US after 1991, doesn't matter. Virgin is part of the EMI group just as Capitol is. Tina has recorded for EMI since the early seventies. EMI should do some more effort for there compilations."
4,Love the long lost videos,"I got this one from my sister because she knows I love Tina so I was excited to see the track list. I was glad they had put the Nutsbush, Break Every Rule and many others on this DVD. What I wasn't glad with was the live versions. They are good but some had videos that could've been put on here instead. Another thing was the Private Dancer video was edited. I remember seeing a longer version of this video on the web and so i thought this is where they got it from but no. Oh well i'm no one to diss so I love this DVD and will cherish it as long as I live. And if another one comes out then I'll get that one too. i am happy with this DVD not only because it's Tina but because my sister drove all the way to another town to get it for me. Now that's love."
2,COLORA HENNA VEG-HAIR COLOR,THIS WAS THE WORST HAIR PRODUCT THAT I EVER USED. IT HAD A TERRIBLE ODOR ANDIT TURNED MY HAIR RED.
2,"Colora Henna, 'Brown', very golden light brown that is...","Background:I used the mix on my overprocessed honey blonde hair with dark ash blonde roots.Results: because I've been using henna powder (pure and mixed) for 3 years or so on and off, I followed my own recipe: mixing the henna powder with 1/2 water, 1/4 strongly brewed chai tea, 1/4 strongly brewed dark coffee, wet set on the hair for 2 hours. The results were ok- the blonde ends turned to a medium golden dark blonde, but the dark ash blonde roots turned a dark reddish chestnut color. This faded in about 6 weeks to a washed out strawberry blonde color which blended decently into my ash blonde roots."
3,good product,"i used caution with this product because i wasn't certain i would get the color i desired. the color was close to what i wanted. although it wasn't long-lasting, it did give my hair somewhat of a sheen along with the color."
4,One of a kind,"I can't believe that nobody else has made a video or series of videos quite like this one (that I am aware of). The techniques range from basic to somewhat advanced (not difficult, but techniques that home cooks might not be using too often) and are clearly demonstrated. Mr. Pepin's creativity is infectious -- makes me want to try new things and play with my food!"
1,Mindless Drivel,"Honestly I cannot understand why anyone calls Heidegger profound or a genius. He is quite frankly not. He just uses convoluted and invented language which completely muddles his point. If the point he was making was at least insightful then maybe it would be worth it, but it's not. He provides nothing of insight to the actual world. And to those who are going to say, ""I don't get it."" I do. With a little bit of work I can understand exactly what he's saying, but what he is saying is mindless drivel that provides nothing of substance. Fans of Heidegger are just elitist intellectuals who think because a text is particularly difficult that the point the writer is making is something of substance."
1,What a Way to Be Losing Time,"Heidegger endeavour is like to examine the condition of whiteness in general.Being is not more real and substantive than whiteness. It is just a category, a verbal shorcut.If per chance is philosophically useful, it is only on the most shallow, no deeper sense.Of course you can write -as he did- more or less moving pages about the condition of the human being, the ""dasein"", but that does not get us one step nearer some kind of ontological certainty.If someone like that kind of writting, I advice the Science of Logic by Hegel, 100 times more interesting and inspiring, although not an inch more convincing."
5,Powerful Mankiewics,"The Mank Brothers were truly amazing. They were pretty far apart, age-wise, but Joe made some great films, and Herman had his hand in so much amazing stuff it's beyond belief.I loved this movie the first time I saw it. It's kind of noir, but Susan Hayward is so awesome, she kind of storms the sarcophagus and rescues Richard Conte. (I realized later that part of why I love this is that format, kind of Sleeping Beauty in reverse.)The other reason I love it is its a treatise on the bright and dark sides of family dynamics. As Freud said 'there is no individual psychology, and almost nothing's been written about Groups.' This is a fascinating meditation on the group, that is not as simplistic as it might seem."
4,Family Values,"This movie was a bit of a surprise for me, I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. This is one family not many would want to be a part of, they are much more than dysfunctional, it's out-right violent.Edward G. Robinson once again plays a role made for him. I'm amazed at how often he's played these types of characters but yet they all are their own man, they don't seem streamlined into one person.The tension the father creates between the brothers, seems so subtle at first, masked behind small jabs the father seems to consider ""kidding"". But, as the years go by all the brothers pretty much hate each other as much as their father. It's surprising that one of the brothers actually makes such a huge sacrifice for his father by going to jail for him."
2,"A tedious, heavy misfire from Mankiewicz, Robinson","It's hard to believe that the Joe Mankiewicz of All About Eve and Letter to Three Wives served up this platter of overcooked pasta. The story is like bad Arthur Miller (or just Arthur Miller). Doing a stage Eye-talian (he sounds worse than Chico Marx), Robinson overplays as a mustachioed patriarch who founds a bank for immigrants; when it gets into trouble, his four sons fall upon one another's throats. What elements of noir creep into the plot (along with Susan Hayward) are neutralized by the ethnic stereotyping. Robinson plays ear-splitting opera and his family eats nothing but spaghetti. It's irksome that this ""serious"" drama -- of no visual interest whatsoever -- made it to video when more unusual and better realized movies (Caged, Desert Fury, 99 River Street) have not."
2,nah...,"you're better off just buying the Not Another Teen Movie sndtrk, as this has the tainted love cover, suicide is painless which is already available on the blair witch 2 soundtrack, so contrary to what amazon says, it was already available.also, i have a rule about singles. never, EVER, buy a manson single that has a song by another band on it."
1,Tour From Hell,"I love this band....however this is a horrible recording. Sounds as if it were recorded with a portable cassette recorder.In fact, the 'ol Commander himself states on his website that this was an unauthorized release of a demo tape and urges the buyer to beware. There are much better live recordings out there (We've Got A Live One Here is great)....avoid this one."
1,"Misleading! TITLE.. Should say Pool Checkers""","No where in the title does this book spell out that it is for "" Pool Checkers"". a much different game than the version that most americans play, Luckly i found a copy at the library, so all that was wasted was time. I dont know anayone who's played this and regular checkers is contrary to popular belief a life study in itself."
5,Universal and moving.,"No matter where you come down on a conflict that is millenia old, this seamless portrait of the warrior as artist, or the artist as warrior, is compelling, riveting and top-notch in both its simplicity and depth of. A portrait of simply complex man. ""We are but as a vapor in time"". This is a must watch film."
2,A Real Gut Buster!,"I don't know how to catogorize this guy or where he fits in between Otis Redding and the Four Tops, but I guess he is in there somewhere.""Slip Away"" is pretty cool. Other than that I really don't have too much to say about this one other than everytime I hear ""Patches"" I turn it up as loud as possible so that it irritates the people around me. When he starts talking, I can't keep a straight face. It is just too much. ""....and then the rains came and washed all the crops away"". Laudy, Laudy...what's we gonna do....?"
5,Tastes Great!,I bought this because I couldn't find it at my local grocery store. I baked brownies with it and they came out super moist and delicious! Will definitely be buying this again.
2,leaves me running for the soap,I feel so unclean after i listen to this cd.The lyrics are so vulgar it would make eminem turn red as a radish.This whole concept album about wishing they could watch their favorite show from the 80's just doesn't work.
5,Rick Steve's Spain 2007,"This was an incredible book for visiting Spain. We should have used it for booking hotels, but didn't buy it until the last minute. But we did use it for sights, meals, getting around, etc. and it was fabulous."
1,Poorly Written Handbook!!,"With the 6th edition of the Cinema 4D Handbook being poorly rated, this one reaches beyond beleif the incomprehensible. The pages has very little writting and the pictures are even more inaccurate than the last volume. Step by Step tutorials are very complicated and at times even impossible to complete due to the lack of explanation.When comming to the vector part of the tutorial, the version does not cover the subject properly at all. The vectorial concepts are defragmented in many parts and hard to understand even what seems the very basic.I DO NOT recommend this book at all and at such high price for such an incompetently written book, it is not worth it."
1,confusing,As a beginner in C4D I found this expensive book difficult to follow w/ poorly printed images (screen shots). I get better results from few online tutorials. I wonder if experienced C4D users will be able to learn anything new from this confusing book.
1,You're better off making origami cranes from the pages.,"I took a beginners Cinema 4d class and unfortunately this book was required. Thank God I didn't pay full price! First of all, reading comprehension is downright atrocious. When you're finished wading through this muck of a book, you'll find you know a lot about WHAT things do, but very little about HOW TO use them. If you haven't bought this yet, turn away quickly and save yourself! You'll learn more on your own by playing with the software, online tutorials or a completely different book (and author?). If you're already stuck with it like me, make about 500 or so origami cranes and you're halfway to being lucky enough to winning your money back in the lottery!"
1,3d is complex enough as it is...,"I am currently taking a 3d class for cinema 4d, with a focus on character animation. This book has some tutorials on using bones and weighting along with some IK and expressions to set up the rig for animaiton. The ""step by step"" instructions that are given leave out important details, are incomplete, and disorganised. Too bad this is the only other reference besides the manual on cinema 4d. Too muddy for a beginner, because if you follow the directions he gives in the book, you end up with more problems than before. Don't trust all of the images either, because they are sometimes not the one the caption is refering to!"
1,Avoid,"Having used Cinema 4D for 3 years on and off, read and reread the (excellent) manuals and a number of tutorials on the web, I was looking forward to a handbook of tips and tricks from the Cinema 4D gurus. I was sorely disappointed. This book is largely a rehash of the manuals and some of the online tutorials, is badly written, poorly organised and illustrated, and in places even inaccurate. Avoid."
4,Other ratings unfair,"While no book is perfect, I feel the other reviewers were overly harsh. If anyone is expecting to be spoon fed the required information on any 3D program they should consider a new occupation.3D modelling and animation is, by its very nature, all about problem solving as no two projects are alike. However, for those willing to invest some time and effort to STUDY the book's concepts and content then a reward can be found. The previous reviewers were correct in that often a complete set of instructions were left out. However, I feel this was Adam's teaching strategy, and by applying the basic skills with my own problem solving abilities I was able to produce not only the tutorial projects, but also my own uniquely concieved ideas and models.Again, if you don't like thinking for yourself and expect a 'how do I have a succesful career?' book, then perhaps this one isn't for you. If, on the other hand, you enjoy applying what you learn you'll get as much out of this book as I have."
1,shiny & shallow,"There's skill here, but no heart. Just a poet who knows her intelligence and cleverness but's blocked. If you wrung out the soul from Ashberry, you'd have Wheeler. There's a poet in New England, Bill Knott, who is far more dextrous than Wheeler; he writes similarly, but the reader feels and laughs. Knott is a dazzler. But not Ms. Wheeler."
1,Emperors new clothes,This book was lent to me by a friend who reads a good deal of poetry. I couldn't believe how bad it was. There is no sense whatsoever of the poet trying to communicate with anyone. To put it bluntly the book is self-indulgent and solipsistic. No wonder there is such a small readership for much of what passes for poetry. By the way I do not spend my evenings reading Longfellow and Emerson. I do read contemporary fiction and poetry. I am not one of those who say that if it doesn't rhyme it isnt poetry... but I draw the line at such self regarding work. Susan wheeler needs to get over her John Ashbury phase and think again. A book which I gave back to my friend with much relief.
3,Cute but Poorly Made,"Just as Galahad the Chaste was disappointed at Castle Anthrax, so too am I with the plush grail! Only in my case, no offers of fun favors from seductive girls were given as consolation. Do not expect it to look like the product picture. My husband calls this my ""plush pimp cup"" because it's hard to tell that it's actually the grail. The stuffing is lopsided so the stem of the grail where it meets the cup isn't straight and there is stuffing in the bottom so it won't stand up on its own; you have to lean it against something. Not a great product, but for only $8 it's an awesome gift idea for a Holy Grail fanatic."
2,c towel holder,"paper holder/dispenser, this item holds great but doesn't want to release the paper. Not a good product if you have children or men in your home."
2,An answer to a non-question,"This is a good attempt to answer a non-question. The meaniningful question is 'What does a particular person mean by the word ""God""?' A second question is 'Does this person behave in ways that seem to fit with what they say they mean by ""God""?' There is no general answer to either question, though it would be possible, by interviewing and observing many individuals, to recognize large sets of people for whom the answers are similar. These sets would probably not correspond with traditional labels such as Christian, Hindu or Atheist, but until serious research has been done it is hazardous to generalize. Still, this is a learned and moderately readable book, as long as you don't expect it to answer a question."
1,Turgid beyond despair,"With terms like the ""hypersensitive agency detection device (HADD)"" and ""minimally counterintuitive (MCI) agents"", the writing in Barret's book is turgid, pretentious, full of acronyms, and pseudoscientific. If Christians want/need a book to try to reinforce their faith in Christianity, I suggest reading C.S. Lewis. His books are better written and perhaps more persuasive."
4,Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack!,"I find this to be one of the finest Robin Williams dramatic/comedic performance. I enjoyed it immensely. Robin Williams portrays Jack Powell, a boy who suffers from a disease that ages him 4 times faster than normal. Just image a 10 year old boy with the body of a 40year old & with the comedy of Robin Williams! School is really a hassle!"
4,Robin Williams as a child,"This is a solid movie. Robin Williams does a great job pretending to be a 10-year-old boy. The boy's condition is similar to Werner syndrome, a disorder that causes premature aging starting during puberty."
4,Enjoyable film,"What would you do if you aged four years for every year that you actually are? Such is the case of Jack, who is ten years old but has a 40-year old body. He really wants to be normal, so he begs his parents to let him go to school. Of course, looking like he does, it's not easy fitting in.This film brought some attention to the aging disorder known as Progeria, though that is not quite what Jack has (his aging is predictable, set at 4 years for each one he actually has, while Progeria is different for everyone) but this was a good film, and I liked it. Robin Williams does a decent job as Jack."
4,Enjoyable Film,Robin Williams is one of my favorite actors/comedians and has played in some amazing movies. Jack is a story about a boy that has a aging disease. Every year he is alive he ages about 4 years or so. Jack realizes at the age of 10 that he's tired of being home-schooled and wants to go to school so he can interact with other kids his age and make friends. Only problem is that he looks like a 40 year old man. I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and I loved it back then and I still think it's a great movie. It's shows how precious your time on this earth can be. Jack never had the chance to experience the full life he was meant to have. By the time he graduated he was almost 70 years old. Jack is a fun and touching ride throughout and I recommend this movie to everyone.
2,Predictable.,"Jack starring Robin Williams is a silly film and I can't believe it's directed by Francis Ford Coppola? The only actor who really impressed in this comedy was Diane Lane, she is too good for this kind of film. Look for a young Jennifer Lopez who plays Jack's sweet teacher. I just hated the concept of the film, even Williams couldn't save this deary weep fest."
5,This movie will make you laugh and cry!,"It is one of the few movies that I can watch over and over and never get tired of. Robin Willams does an excellent job of being a kid in an adult body. In response to the reviewer that referred to this movie as offensive to the children who actually have this disease - get a life! This movie shows not only the fun he had but also the challenge of fitting in and the desire to be just a ""normal star"". If anything, this movie shows children with this disease, their possibilities and not their limitations. To the offended reviewer, watch the movie again not only with your eyes but with your heart."
1,Painfully bad,"Jack is easily one of Robin Williams' and Francis Ford Coppola's worst films. Most of the fault lies in the terrible script, a mishmash of cliches and predictability, hackneyed dialogue, along with a serious lack of tasteful humor. There's nothing the least bit creative about this film, and nothing funny at all."
2,It could have been good idea ...,"... if Coppola and Williams had at least made a single mention of progeria. What's progeria, you say? Well, it's this very real, rare disease that causes children to age 10 years for every year they live. Of course, they don't look like an average adult, but then Robin Williams wouldn't have been able to run around acting like a kid for a couple of hours. However, if the crew had used the comedy aspects to hook viewers, and then give them information about progeria at the end, I would have been okay with it. But since they didn't, I will: http://www.progeriaresearch.org/."
1,Shame on you Francis,"Unbelieveably bad fare from the maker of such masterpieces as Apocolypse Now and the Godfather trilogy. Williams is well suited for the role, but the story really goes nowhere. It's a fairly offensive film when you think about the actual children afflicted with this hyper aging condition, they certainly have nowhere near the fun Williams has in this movie."
3,BIG?,"actually, i have never seen the movie. but i like coppola. but as far as the other reviewers saying it is a wonderfully original movie, have you seen tom hanks in big?hmmmmmmmmmmmm....."
2,FFC,"FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA SHOULD STICK TO WHAT HE DOES BEST; DIRECTING DRAMA FILMS. ALTHOUGH THIS IS SURPRISINGLY GOOD, I THINK COPPOLA OVERDID IT"
4,Little more work on protecting the product,I think it could've been a bit more protected but other then that it was a great order. I'll be ordering again soon.
4,Touching,"This is a very good movie. For writing purposes I understand why they over-exaggerated the disease and it fit the morel of the movie. This morel is to live your life like it's your last. Robin Williams...No the entire cast did a great job on this one. Maybe not Bill Cosby but he did what he could. This movie has many elements to it in regards to the importance of life, friendship, and family. Alot of little boy humor sure but it really isnt a kids movie either. Great movie I recommend for anyone."
5,Robin Williams is brilliant,"This movie features Robin Williams starring as Jack, a boy who ages at four times the normal rate. While his body looks like he's forty, he's really only 10. When I saw him in this film I though he was very convincing. I've never seen anybody else be able to pull off what Robin Williams does. Because he appears to be so much older, it's harder for him to make friends. I would recommend this film."
5,You don't have a heart if you don't love this movie!,"This movie is everything. Funny, touching, thought-provoking, and a story of valuing each and every moment of our lives. This is truly a family film worth watching for generations to come! More movies need to be like this one. Robin Williams was brilliant and the supporting cast top knotch as well. Enjoy this great movie and make your life ""spectacular!"""
3,The Call of the East,"Johann, an artist is trapped in a lifeless, loveless marriage. He sublimates his life into his intellectualism and his art. He has a failed relationship with his wife and with his older son but not (yet) with his younger son, to whom he diverts his love. His good friend wants him to go to India to experience the ""East"" and to break out of his feelingless shell. Johann will get his chance but only after a family tragedy. But we suspect it will take more than a trip to India for Johann to break out of his shell because you can't run away from yourself. Given that Hermann Hesse, the author, has a reputation for works focusing on Eastern vs. Western philosophy (he is better known for Siddhartha and Steppenwolf), there is surprisingly little actual philosophy in the book. It reads a bit stiffly, as if a Victorian writer were trying his hand at a soap opera script. The book, written in 1914, is translated from the German."
4,Hesse is Wonderful=),"His works are filled with elements of tragedy, aesthetic realization and, on a lesser note, thoughts of suicide in one form or another. Pierre's death was foreshadowed but I still cried throughout. Hesse's writing is very simple, but very interesting and beautiful."
4,Great entry level book!,"This is the second Arabic lesson book in my collection, for Arabic studies. My first was a lesson book to learn just the Arabic alphabet, and this book blended well with the pace that I was studying. This is truly an entry level book that encouraged me to keep learning. Great Job!"
3,"Beginner Arabic, not beyond","This book is well designed with basic vocab and activities, including flashcards. It appears to be a very good book for building basic vocab. The only reason I give it three stars is that I expected vocab that was ""Beyond Beginner Arabic"" from the title and description. I even did the ""Look Inside"" perusal of the book and thought it looked good. But when it arrived, I saw that it is fairly thin (112 pages followed by about 16 pages of flash cards). The vocab is good, solid stuff that needs to be mastered in order to ""move beyond beginner Arabic"", just as the title claims, but if you have the impression that the vocab in this book is itself ""beyond beginner Arabic"", as I did, you will be disappointed."
3,Adam's Weslandia Book Review,"Weslandia is a made up book that people like to read. The book is a folk tale about a little boy that makes his own civilization. He makes his own food, clothing, and other things he needs to survive. He even makes juice.I think it's a great book. You guys would like it, too. Go get it from your public library. Get it today!"
2,"Wrong message, disturbing trend","This book did not go where I was expecting/hoping. I am reminded of another children's book with a horrible message, The Rainbow Fish.One book says that no one will like you if you are ""too"" popular/pretty/successful until you give away everything you have and gain/bribe acceptance. This book sends the message that the outcast can be liked but only if he practically cures cancer.The book offers little hope for the outcast not ambitious enough to accomplish major and impossible things. I thought the boy would end up being happy in his own world, or perhaps gain one or two close friends. The ridiculous ""overkill"" on having him completely accepted and even copied, sent this into the ridiculous and made it unrelateable or helpful to children that are loners."
4,Saisha's Weslandia book Review,"I am going to tell you about Weslandia. This book is exciting because in the first part of the story you would want to know what is going to happen in the story. From the cover of the story you would want to know what the story is going to be about.I think it is funny because people have hair cuts in the story that look like Mohawks. No one liked Wesley because he was different from the other boys. Wesley's summer project was that the flowers in the garden grew bigger, and he made a lot of stuff out of them.At the end he had a lot of friends, and everyone copied him. He earned money by making and selling suntan lotion and mosquito repellent, which he made from his flowers.I like the story because it is funny."
1,"This book has one ""trick"" and teaches it over and over and o","Behan's book is currently out of print. Maybe I should say ""mercifully."" I found a copy on eBay. I enjoyed the first explanation of the central thesis (use the prey instinct to train you dog) for the first chapter. Then the second chapter was the same, and the third and so on. I desperately wanted to find out something PRACTICAL. Gentle reader.., go ahead and jump to page 100 when you open this book. You won't miss a thing. And Behan will tell you what you missed. How many times can you say ""harmony"" and ""prey instinct?"""
4,A Classic,"I gave this book 4 starts because it was a Christmas gift for my husband, and what it liked about it was it was written for use with hand tools. The puzzles are fun and challenging, and the solutions are found in the back of the book. It was out of print so I was glad I was able to get it from the Amazon store through a third party vendor. My used the library copy to get instructions to make Christmas gifts for family members and they were the hit of the season."
3,Great book for new mothers,"I bought this book as a gift for a first time Mom. Although I haven't read the whole book, it has lots of prayers a mother can pray for her child and it looked really good."
2,Impressively Boring,"I've owned this album for a few years and I've finally decided to sell it and just purchase the ""Say Something"" single. Aside from that track there really isn't any benefit to buying the album. ""Lately"" is also a pretty good song but the problem with most of these tracks is the singer. He's just too good! The lyrics and the music just don't do his voice justice. I get really frustrated listening to this album because I expect a great ballad to flow from his voice yet it never does. The harder songs on this album definitely don't fit with his soft singing style either. Don't buy this album based on the 3 good songs you hear, though there probably aren't that many."
4,Derivative originality,"The snarky Brit critics say these guys are nothing but a bunch of shallow Radiohead imitators. Not quite. Yes, there is the chorus of anthemic guitars neatly covering over pinched-voice vocals (but not wimpy a la Coldplay). But the structure, texture and bridging of the songs is top-notch. Actually, if you can picture Radiohead with some Gin Blossoms mixed in, you get a good idea of what their sound is. Okay, so Still Tonight could have been stolen from a Cheap Trick ballad, but you still find yourself singing along to it. And songs like Til The End, Beautiful Thing and Where Is The Love are all strong rock 'n' roll songs. Say Something is Top 10 in Britain. These days, you feel lucky if you get an album with three songs you like on it. This one, for me, has eight. So it's 20 bucks. Well worth it. Just wait until US Alternative Radio discovers these guys."
5,Wonderful blend of styles - I await a US tour,"Haven are more accessible than Radiohead, more upbeat and driving than Travis, and more melodic than Coldplay. I think this is a stellar release - every song is a gem."
3,A quite enjoyable album,"The first time I had ever had of Haven was hearing the wonderful ""Let it Live"" on satellite radio. I decided to check them out further. I must say that I wasn't dissapointed. And though this album will never reach ""classic"" status by any means, this album is definitely worth listening to. The musicianship is great, the songs contain good melodies and catchy hooks, and the vocals are decent as well. If you're a fan of other Brit-Pop bands, you should enjoy this album. However I feel that Haven do bring something a bit different to the table. I'm really sure that I can give an accurate comparision to another band as far as sound goes. Maybe a bit more heavy Coldplay with a sprinkle of early Radiohead, with Jeff Buckley vocals."
3,good and overlooked,"This good and overlooked band has much of the reminents of other UK bands that it follows, with such similar ounds of early U2, radiohead and Buckley. It's good album. If anything a bit slow and awkward in the begininning, to the point that it is hard to connect or really get into the music. But don't throw it out of your player yet. ""say Something"" is ultimately beautiful, along with songs like ""Sleep"" and ""Outside"" that just simply sound cool. A lot of intricate guitar work make this record seem easier and more hip to listen to.The basic truth is that, if you are into other UK bands like Starsailor and Coldplay that have gotten some or great recognition, then there is a good chance that you will find a home with this one.There might not be anything revolutionary here, but that does not demolish the fact that this is a solid debut, from a band that has promise."
2,Thin bowls,Order came on two different dates. When I ordered the bowls they where in stock… but for some reason they where not shipped together. The bowls are very thin… I have a 1 year old rottweiler and 1 of the bowls bent. They r not going to last. I guess my husband is right. You get what u pay for.
4,Dog bowls,These are nice dog bowls for the price. I would definately purchase again. They are sturdy and wash well in the dishwasher.
1,ACDelco Fuel Pump,"The pump is not a stock AC Delco Fuel Pump, but an after market pump, and was completely different from the image. I would not buy this again."
1,Inadequate book,This text is incomplete in its coverage...does not have any sample questions like what you would expect from a cramming book.... it is not what I thought it would be (I had the exam cram series book in mind when I looked at this one)... looks to have contents taken off from OCP: ORacle8i DBA Performance Tuning and Network Administration Study Guide by Joseph C. Johnson and the contents condensed into 43 pages.
4,Day by Day,"Here in Brazil, we have a very good impression about this book. Therefore, it's very dificult to buy it."
1,I am extremely reluctant to give these one star...,"..because I should be able to give them 0 stars. First of all, I LOVED the style--the buckles, the heel, the toe--fantastic. Other than that, these are crap.They were advertised as leather, but are made of incredibly cheap plastic...it would rip easily. The fabric is cracked & scratchy, & even feels hideously cheap. Not worth what I paid for themThe sole was almost as bad. Cheap, cheap, cheap.And the height--I ordered these because I thought they were taller than normal boots--WRONG. Just like the other pair I own, which I was NOT hoping for. Most likely, I should have measured more accurately, because the height is given in the product description.Bottom line: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE. There are tons of more interesting boots on Amazon."
2,Not my favorite....,"I understood when I bought the boots that they weren't leather but from the picture they look so cool. However, up close they look like they're painted with swirls to look ""aged"" and feel almost like paper. I wouldn't wear these unless I was using them for a costume."
1,not so cool,"these boots look awesome in the tiny photo, but once I recieved them I was immediately disappointed. The leather is ""weathered"" in a cheap looking way, like someone took a brillo pad and scratched circles into the boot. Also, the fit was bad. They were very uncomfortable, with no traction what so ever on the bottoms. I still like the idea, but these boots just seem cheap."
2,it's ok,"If you're wanting an RC Helicopter, go ahead and spend more money to get a better,bigger one."
2,breaks easily - can't fix with replacement parts,It doesn't fly as well as they say but it was fun while it lasted - for all of one day. I bought the replacement parts but it didn't help make it work again. You should not buy this!
2,Crime Partners,"Just like all the other Donald Goines books I've read, the first chapter drew me in like a bee to a flower. But, unlike the other books, from chapter two on almost made me lose my desire to finish the book. To me, some of chapters lost connection from one chapter to the next. And, not to mention the detectives, they truly did not deserve the mention that they received. Anyone could have played those characters -- even without names. However, one bad apple does not spoil the whole bag and I will continue to read all the books written by Donald Goines."
2,I've seen better,"Goins is a good author, but he has written better books (see Daddy Cool or Cry Revenge). I agree this is a book you can't put down, but only because you want to finish it quick and get it out of the way. The first chapter or two draws you in with rich character development, but the plot falls apart quick. You should check out some of Goins' work, just not this one."
4,GREAT & GRITTY,"""Crime Partners"" was my first exposure to Donald Goines, but I'm already putting some of his other books in my shopping cart. The book is dynamic with a capital ""D""!The opening chapter draws you in, paragraph after paragraph until you reach the end of the chapter. You take a deep breath, trying to work through what you've read, trying to tell yourself that you don't know people like the characters but you know you do, then you begin chapter two. Chapter two ups the stakes by introducing two new characters.Characters. That's what drives this action-packed tale of ghetto justice. Realistic, emotion-filled, hardened or soft, passionate, CHARACTERS. Goines has a way of getting inside a character's head like few authors can. You understand the motivations behind their actions. You feel their pain, their joy, their disgust.What more can you ask for from a writer? The next book!"
5,LOYAL ALWAYS,"THIS WAS ANOTHER BOOK ABOUT LOYALTY! I ENJOYED THIS BOOK! AT FIRST I WAS LIKE, HERE WE GO HE IS TRYING TO SAVE THE STREETS! WHEN I GOT INTO IT I COULD NOT STOP UNTIL I WAS DONE! CRIME PARTNERS WAS JUST WHAT THAT WERE UNTIL THE END. THEY DID CRIME TOGETHER, LIVED TOGETHER AND DIED TOGETHER! THIS IS A MUST READ! I LIKED THE BOOK!"
5,Been waiting a long time for this one!!!!,"It was certainly worth the wait!! I wish they would have released scores for other soundtracks, Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous especially, featuring Nancy Wilson's beautiful acoustic music. This music is exceptional as in Nancy and her acoustic guitar!!! I bought two of these; one for me and another to give away. PLEASE, more acoustic songs from NANCY WILSON!!!!!!!!!"
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I liked the movie and after reading all the rave reviews I decided to buy the disc. It is certainly quality material but doesn't quite hold up as a musical experience independent of the movie. There are 21 tracks and the disc is not much over 30 minutes long. Thus many of the tracks are only a minute or two long. Just as a track gets interesting, it fades out and ends. In my opinion it often feels like a ""sampler"" disc. It is quite frustrating because the music certainly has potential."
1,Totally Ripped Off,"Any one who puts out a CD with 21 songs on it that totals 30 minutes of music on it is the ""Rippe"" and the person who buys it is ""Totally Ripped Off"" no matter who plays on it."
1,Remake,"These are not original tracks.These are remakes of the original.If you are looking for original Mary Wellssongs as I was, Do Not purchase this CD.These are remakes of the original."
3,"Voice is still there, but not the originals","I've enjoyed Mary Wells for years, but nostalgia buffs should beware. These are all remakes, and not terribly interesting ones, lite-jazz, bouncy-pop backings. MW's voice is still delightful, but buyers should shop around (excuse me Smokey Robinson) if they are only going to buy one of her albums."
4,"Not great, but fun","First of the game is fun, enjoyed from the moment I picked it up and started to play it. This comes from a person who plays [edited]. It like the other reveiwers are a bunch of nerds who probaly hated platoon and full metal jacket. The game does not have any gliches has opposed to what another reveiwer said. This is a must game for people who like Platoon or any other great Vietnam war movie."
3,Some good game play...some hype though,"I bought this because the commercials had you think it was surreal in the original Nam' experience. It does have adult language and headshots of friends but it also is very repeatitive in gameplay. It just seems kind of standard. Nothing you are going to ruch home to play, kind of blah."
2,Doesn't hold up,This game does not hold up the voice acting is horrid. The graphics are crap ! And the story is just not interistting. Good for a good cheap thrill nothing else
3,not the greatest but fun none the less,"I enjoyed this game from start to finish. It was reminisant of [edited]. The reason why I gave it a lower marking is because my copy had bugs in it. It would hang up in the middle of game play. but once you started it over from the begining of the stage you left off from tha carnage continued. if you are into war games, shooters or even war history for that matter check this out."
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!,"This game is terrible! I went and got it the day it came out and played it for about a half hour and hated it. This is coming from a gamer who is only into mature titles, mostly war games such as [edited] The reasons this game sucks is too many to list but be warned...wait for [edited]!"
3,Doesn't fill the ridges,"Perhaps my ridges are worse than the other reviewers. But this product does not fill the ridges in my nails. It perhaps makes a small difference but not an awful lot. I have to put other polish over it to get the appearance I want. It is easy to apply and dries reasonably fast. O.P.I. also claims their U.S. product line is now non toxic. But since I bought it to fill ridges and it really doesn't do that, I consider it a waste of money. I'd love to find a product that actually works."
4,Did it's job but make polish chip,I bought this ridge filler because I was having my fake nails taken off and I wanted my nail to look smooth when I painted them. It definately made my painted nails look smooth but I think it made them chip more easily.
4,Great book!,A good read...an insiders account of a profession that is totally mis-understood and under appreciated. These are the good guys!
3,Glo minerals,Great product and good price. The cake feeling or looking once it is applied. Recommend to anyone. Love the makeup
1,Very light coverage,"I purchased this product hoping that because of it's description (highly pigmented, for covering hyperpigmentation and scars, etc.)it would actually cover freckles and blemishes. The concealer disappears from my skin within an hour of application. I've tried applying it in layers, frequent re-application, etc. without success. I've come to the conclusion that I wasted the $18.00 I spent on this product, as I have had better success with drug store concealers such as Maybelline and L'oreal."
4,Oil free! Love this stuff!,I have been searching for a good concealer that has a couple must haves: 1. Oil free 2. Wont flake or dry out my already flaky and dry spots and 3.Good coverage. This is a really good product. I use it on my eyes and my blemishes including current acne and older acne scars. I really like this stuff and will continue to use it. I gave it 4 stars because it is a little yellow based so you cannot use too much of it or it becomes noticeable. I use it sparingly in layers until I get the coverage I want without the yellow coloring.
4,camouflage cream,"great cover up...applies well, no oil, good skin match, doctor recommended it.smallish container, so used up quicker - but worth it."
3,Glo Minerals,"I'm giving this 3 stars because the color guide was misleading. The concealer itself is wonderful... goes on smooth and turns matte immediately, but being fair skinned, the color was far too dark. I'd probably buy again if they'd put up lighter colors, or show which colors work with which skin tones."
3,Pretty good,"Seems pretty good, especially in a group/class setting. I'm a student of language, though, and it doesn't explain much of the grammar in this book, preferring to use phrases, and I assume that the grammar comes from somewhere else (a teacher?). I would have preferred a verb conjugation chart, and more grammar. Perhaps a separate book just for vocab vs. grammar."
4,Back to front study,"This book throws you right in, you will need to download the software but other then that its been a great help!"
3,It is something I would have to devote some serious time to.,"I did have some problems because she goes too fast in going from Hebrew with the diacritics (the vowel points and other points)and the other. It's been a while since I looked at it, but I found it very hard for me. Maybe I would have figured it out if I spent more time in it."
2,Could not access site on a Mac,"I was looking forward to combining multimedia and print in helping my daughter learn Hebrew, but I could not access any of the information on the U. of Texas site on my Mac, so this was all pretty frustrating"
2,Multimedia Does Not Work As Advertised,"The supplemental internet information was difficult to find, not at the location printed in the book and did not work smoothly on my computer. University of Texas website (where the web page is maintained) is slow and makes the process tedious.I felt ..."
4,Very Easy Computer Basics Text,"Reviewed the book with the idea of using it as the text for an intermediate level computer course taught at an education facilty for senior citizens. The book would be an excellant text for an entry level course as it is very easy to follow, very detailed in how it presents the material, and well worth the price. I'd recommend it to anyone who is just starting out with personal computers and has a Wintel system running Windows XP and Office 2003."
1,I NEVER RECEIVED MY ORDER UNTILL TODAY!! IT IS TOO BAD!!!,"I ORDER THIS BOOK FOR MORE THAN 1 MONTH ALREADY, AND I NEVER RECEIVED IT!! I NEED MY MONEY BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!THIS IS THE WORST EXPERIENCE I EVER HAD!!!"
5,biscuit cutters,these were exactly what I was looking for. The are tin and sturdy... I also cook eggs in them to make them round for the biscuits! Thanks!
2,Not very sturdy,"The biscuit cutters are a lot flimisier than I expected. They bend easily and seem like they will lose their shape over time. I like the handles that are attached, but for the amount of money I was expecting something sturdier."
3,Fox Run Biscuit Cutters,"Fox Run Biscuit Cutter's are ok, not the best. The metal is a bit too thin. The handle bends if I use it to cut the dough, so I'm not entirely satisfied with it."
2,Not what I expected,"After reading about this product in a style magazine I decided to give it a try. I was looking for a cherry-almond oil to use as a skin moisturizer and this was said to work well. This product is more for *recreational* purposes as the name suggests. It is sticky and sweet, more like a cough syrup than a body oil.The packaging is cute, but the bottle had a cork that broke when I tried to take it out. I had no choice but to empty it into another container. I wound up mixing it with an unscented lotion so I could still use it as a moisturizer. It worked ok, but I wouldn't buy it again unless I needed a bachelorette gift or something."
1,Do not any of this type of book,"Do not waste you money on this or this type of book. If you want to insert JavaScripts on your Web page without knowing about how it works, buy this book. Otherwise not. This book has wasted space by including instructions like ""Type a quote.."" or ""Type an angle bracket..."" or ""Press Enter.."". But des not explain how the script works. Does the author thinks that we are stupid?"
1,this is just fun,I bought this book to learn java script fast but besides couple of examples how to play with pictures there is nothing in there. Do not make the same mistake! The only book from the same series that I like was HTML4.
3,SCRIPTS DON'T WORK,"It seems to me that most of these scripts don't work. I'm in IT and also a web site administrator, and I still can't get them to work as they are written. I give the authors a 3 for being motivated enough to write the book, though. It seems that they have good intentions."
2,There has to be a better way...,"I am a huge fan of the Visual Quickstart series. They do a wonderful job teaching the basics, whether it be PhotoShop or HTML. Generally, they also provide more than enough information to progress to more in-depth training on a particular subject matter. I can not, however, recommend Javascript for the World Wide Web. I found this book confusing at best, lacking in substance, and poorly ordered with no logical progession in the lessons. This book is great provided all you want is some code to copy onto your page...the codes do work, but it falls short when it comes to providing a basic understanding of the language, it's syntax, and underlying principles. I had much more luck with web-based tutorials. I can not tell you where to look for a good beginning Javascript manual, but I can say that this book isn't it."
3,Many useful examples,"Well, this book is just like its title: A Quick Start. It gives you a lot of useful and real-life examples which you can just apply to your own webpage, but it lacks of (really, I mean it) the basic explanation from ground up. So you have to be at least a little bit experienced in programming in order to understand the examples (array, loop, etc.)"
4,It's fairly a good book for beginner,"I think it is a good book for someone who knows nothing about JavaScript to start with. I am an experienced UNIX/C programmer but have no experience with HTML or JAVA. After reading a couple of chapters from this book, I was able to do some ""cool"" things with my webpage. However, I wouldn't recommend it if you are serious about doing webpages for living because this book only covers basic stuff."
2,Waste of Money,"I'm a junior level programmer. When it comes to programming there are no ""quick solutions."" This book is more confusing than useful -- it teaches a few basic JavaScript tricks, but will not enable anyone to truly get anything useful from JavaScript. For the same money you can get some much better beginner JavaScript books."
2,JavaScript requires a left-brained treatment.,"The book glosses over the basics of JavaScript: the bracket is introduced in two contexts without any explanation (in one instance, the left and right brackets serve as conventional C-style array index delimiters, in another as some sort of string search delimiter). I'm going to have to resort to the Web or to another book to find out. If you want to learn about the JS language, don't buy this book. It's written with a right-brained, Macintosh rules!, drag-and-drop bent. It does not include a decent appendix/glossary section. I wish I could comment further on the book, but I gave up and have already returned the rag to CostCo, in disgust. I'm tempted to give it one star, just to bring the average down and to discourage other buyers."
5,Surprisingly Useful and Inspiring! I Recommend It!,"I appreciate the way the authors give ""real world"" examples of JS. And they provide a useful web site to complement the book. Many publishers/authors fail here. I have several $50 JS books that are less useful than this $18 one. A great addition to any JS library. Much better than most other VQS Guides. I had been struggling for 3 weeks (!) with a custom Script. None of my ""expert"" friends could figure it out. None of the online gurus. After 4 hours with this book I SOLVED it with style. Their writing style inspires experimentation (unlike other bland guides) I'm looking forward to their advanced guide. Maybe Peachpit will give them a budget for a full blown book. BUY THIS BOOK! You Won't Regret It."
3,ONLY COPY AND PASTE,"I think this book is for the people who dont have a clue about any programming language and just want to know what the so called javascript is. I am an experienced programmer and I bought this book because I wanted to learn Javascript, instead I just got a book that says ""You do this by putting this on the Web"" Why you have to do that ? Figure it out by yourself. Is a ""Quick"" Start, so quick that at the end you dont learn anything.I now have it as a Quick Reference, if I want to do something just go to the book and copy the code from there, and no idea why."
1,Inadequete Explanation,"I bought this book hoping to learn how to write my own JavaScript code in Adobe GoLive. This book did not work out for me. The book consists entirely of examples with inadequete explanations of how JavaScript works. The examples began to become clear only after I studied some of the many tutorials available on the web. I am now working through ""The Book of JavaScript"" by Dave Thau, a book I heartily recommend. ..."
3,"Easy to use scripts, but doesn't teach you Javascript","This book presents some Javascript basic concepts and offers code for some of Javascripts most common uses such as rollovers, cycling banners, and detecting browser plug-ins, etc. These are easy to use even for a beginner such as myself. The disappointment with this book is that it does not really teach you how to write your own Javascripts. This book is designed for those who want to quickly enliven their pages by using some of the scripts presented."
4,A book for an intermediate user,This book is a good source for basic java script It helps in the development of a web page. This book has no long explanations which is a plus for a person who just wants the straight code.
5,A great little book to get started,"This is not the book for the advanced programmer, but if you want a quick jump start, this little book is for you. Examples are explained line by line, and the examples are presented on the same page opposite the text. This is the perfect layout for teaching yourself javascript quickly. If you are a beginner or a newbie to javascript or have limited experience, this book will jump-start you to create your own scripts right away."
1,Peachpit Press Made a Mistake with This One,"I'm a big fan of Peachpit Press's Visual Quickstart Guides -- in fact, when people ask me for advice on learning to make web pages, I don't hesitate to recommend Elizabeth Castro's HTML for the World Wide Web. However, the 3rd edition of this book is a huge disappointment and truly did nothing to help me understand JavaScript and how it works. It really doesn't even have many good or original scripts in it!Interestingly enough, I had an earlier edition of this book (I can't remember whether it was the 1st or 2nd edition) which, although written by different authors, was equally unhelpful.I've gotten far more out of Joe Burns' online JavaScript tutorials at Earthweb."
2,Not What I Wanted,"I have bought this book the other day expecting to learn javascript, It is basicly a book OF javascripts teaching you basicly nothing. I am an expert and HTML, Perl and a few others and I am very dissapointed. If you want the most popular scripts get this book but otherwise i would not reccomend it. I am also a fan of the Visual Quickstart Series but this has to be one of their worst books. I reccomend you buying a different book,Thanks for reading Chris"
2,Good for 'cut and paste' code but not for learning,"If you want to be able to do something quickly using Javascript, do not buy this book. Instead go to one of the several Javascript tutorials on the internet and get your code from there. The information is the same and you will save yourself some money. If, like me, you actually want to learn the scripting language and not just cut and paste code, well then this book is a true waste of money. You will learn every little and most likely will not be able to write your own code having gone through it. Try 'Javascript Bible' instead. It has more substance to it."
1,AAAHHHhh,"please take this away from me lest i burst into flames and singe my shorts, there is no short way to learn js. the definitive guide takes time to get to any good stuff but at the end of the day you will understand js. from there hack about yourself. d."
2,"Monkey see, monkey do","This book is ideal for those who have a passing curiosity about Javascipt, but it is defininately NOT a reference manual. Not a bad investment for the weekend web doodler who is intimidated by learning new computer languages. This book isn't designed to TEACH much about Javascript; it takes a ""monkey see, monkey do"" approach. Not a book for serious programmers."
2,Very shallow,"This series is usually very good. But this one leaves you with not much more knowledge of JavaScript then when you started. It gives you plenty of examples to follow, without telling you the How's and Why's. You don't learn JavaScript so much as follow directions. Very dissapointing."
4,A good starting point,"This book won't teach you ""everything you need to know"", but it's a good starting point and it's inexpensive. The sample code is well set up - you can see the JavaScript with the surrounding HTML (the JavaScript is in red type, HTML is in black, so it's easy to spot) - much easier to understand what is going on when you can see both together. Too many other books show ""snippets"" of code in isloation and get you confused easily. Again - this book isn't the ""JavaScript Bible from A-to-Z"", but it doesn't pretend to be. It's a good buy."
4,"Excellent primer: clear, concise useful examples.","Not as thorough as the big chunky books i've seen gotten and read.. but this one made it simple and gave me the simple tips to what i wanted to know (rollovers, status line, window & frame mgmt, etc.) good starting book for those curious and in the know as a refreshingly clean read."
2,It is only good for specific tasks,"If you are looking for some quick trick to put on you web page, then this is a good book. It doesn't, however do very well at explaining JavaScript. You are not going to learn that very well from this book. I suggest you get a different book for Javascript."
2,Wish The Author's Code Worked.,I liked the chapters but found the author's code examples flawed--to say the least. I would forget this one and spend the extra money to get Danny Goodman's JavaScript Bible 3rd Edition. This book takes you on a short and bumpy JavaScript ride. Don't go!
5,This is the book to read first,"If you know basic HTML, and want to get a start on JavaScript, this is absolutely the best book to get. It leads you gently through the basics, providing lots of useful and thoroughly explained example scripts. I've used this book to teach non-programmers, humanities students who were building web pages for their classes, and it really works. Smith and Negrino are not just good programmers, they're good writers and teachers, and they keep the companion web site up to date. Their book is a fabulous foundation for JavaScript, and you can start using JavaScript almost immediately, even if you only use their example scripts. They're also unusual, as JavaScript book authors, in that they teach good scripting habits, as well as the usual nuts and bolts."
3,Great intro,"Very good primer on Java Script. This book is truly for the literal beginner, but excels in this capacity. Upon completion you will need to move on to a more thorough treatment."
2,It's practically empty.,"The book is obviously written for Netscape, like so many other JavaScript books, neglecting the fact that more people use IE.There is code on almost every page that can be used without modification in your web pages to add functionality, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. However, there is almost no explanation for how or why the code is written, and absolutely nothing to detail syntax, properties, or functions the code.After reading the entire book, a reader would still be left unable to write their own code."
2,Not Much Detail,"I was hoping that this book would be a good overview of JavaScript. Instead, it is full of specific examples of code and brief walkthroughs of the code. It would have been much more helpful if there were comprehensive descriptions of the code or objects. And even though the author encourages the reader to place comments in their code, he neglects to do this for the samples. This would have been extremely helpful as there were many times when I understood the code as a whole, but found some statements confusing and could not tell what exactly they were doing."
3,Nothing Wrong with Book,Good book. Haven't read and didn't actually use for class purchased. Perhaps I will get around to reading it some day.
3,Excellent Material,This book was well packaged for delivery. I like it for the clarity with which the authors present the various lessons.I hope to derive a lot from it and to add to my skills.I am still going through it and so far it has been very exciting. Thank you for the good business. A value for the money.
2,Too many editorial blunders...,"You can't even do the first example in the book without referring to the companion website for the accurate script. Also, the authors neatly skip over the difference in their examples between what the operators are and what is specific to their example. Not a good idea for a Quickstart Guide, my impression of which is that it's supposed to be a starting point for new users... definitely not the case here. I am in the market for a new book on JavaScript, because this one just did not work for me."
2,Not very helpful...,This book has alot of examples for accomplishing different tasks but was very light on explaining concepts and even syntax sometimes. My very first javascript program was to create an HTML table with dynamic content and it was quite difficult with this book. I'm not exactly sure what purpose a book like this serves unless you find a pre-written script that closely meets your needs. I recommend that you keep looking if you want a helpful javascript book. Using this book to create your own script was much too aggravating!
1,Doesn't even deserve a star...,"If you want examples of how to do specific things, this book may be for you (I doubt it), but if you really want to know what the stuff means, don't waste your money. I returned my copy.If you want examples to copy, you don't need a book. There are plenty of sites out there to learn from."
2,Very beginner book on JavaScript,"I wasn't very impressed with this book. After reading HTML4 for WWW, I thought this would be good too. It was hardly any reference material at all. I would not recommend this for a professional developer. I agree with another reviewer that said He was thinking of throwing it away. Disappointing, don't waste your money on it."
1,Highly Disappointed,"I don't believe I've ever used a Visual Quickstart guide but I had always heard very positive comments about the series from friends so when the time came for me to get an intro book for JavaScript, I gave this one a try. After 2 weeks, I returned the book because it was virtually useless to me. I had more useful information about JavaScript in my HTML Blackbook than in this book and I've been using my HTML Blackbook as a reference until I find a JavaScript book that I like."
3,more like Laite in 7 days,"While I have been programmer since 1980 and being paid for it, unlike MANY recent people. I repsect the book for what it has. Quick simple examples that make one thing clear. They do work and that is all the WWW is looking for. No one want to reinvent the JAVA just for themselfs. The book does rush, and like so many 'in 7,21 days' you can do this; its not a comprehensive manual. But it never stated it was! As for netscape v. IE live with it. Anyone remember beta vs VHS. Now you have to think DVD."
1,Very disappointing,"This book does not belong with the VQS series. It does not teach you javascript. It just shows you some, don't get me wrong, useful scripts, but it doesn't TEACH. When I read others' scripts, I don't understand some of the functions because they were not taught. I STRONGLY suggest not buying this book, but trying ""Designing with Javascript"" by o'reilley."
4,A GENINUE QUICKSTART,This book truly lives up to its title. It delivers on its promise to get you writing javascript quickly. The coding examples are excellent and accompanying commentary very well written.The layout makes it very easy to use. It has been an invaluable tool.
5,Best Javascript Book,"Great, the way the authors explain is amazing. A great feature is how the authors name functions and variables to show what their script is actually doing. It's fairly short, to the point, and an amazing reference, too."
4,Great intro to DHTML!,"When I am faced with learning a new technology on the web I always try to find a Visual QuickStart Guide on the subject. These books are great for learning. They break the code down into simple, easy to understand chunks. The DHTML book focuses on the more interactive elements of JavaScript. Once you start to understand DHTML your pages can really pop with excitment!I strongly suggest this book to web designers who want to take the extra step."
2,Poor for learning,"This book covers some introductory scripting, but does not develope the concepts behind most of what it attempts to teach. If you already know JS, then most of this book is redundant. If you don't know JS, then don't buy this book to get a solid foundation of knowledge. The publisher does a good job of laying out the printing of the book and its graphical presentation is refreshing, but it performs poorly on teaching incrementally.I don't know what audience this book was written for, frankly."
2,"A decent javascript cookbook, an inadequate js teacher","This book is a cookbook. It gives you javascript recipes, but if you really want to learn to write scripts on your own, you should look elsewhere. You may get recipes here, but very little about programming principles, and very little about why javascript does what it does. Don't pick up this book if you've never programmed before, unless you aren't really planning on programming again."
4,if you are a beginner this book is for you.,"This book is probably only for beginners. It just teaches the basics on rollover, animation, status box, etc. After reading the book I was able to write javascript on my own and also look at other peoples scripts and understand them and modify them for my own needs."
4,a good starting point...,"Get both the first and second edition. More than an instruction book (although with some study of the code, you can more or less teach yourself the principles underlying the programming)- both volumes are nice, concise collections of useful scripts (no 500 lines of bloat code to make a rudimentary appointment book like I've seen in some Javascript books). Definitely Netscape-centric, but so what? If you're using MSIE, have you stopped to consider ""why""? Can you say - proprietary extensions? If you insist on MSIE, then wait for Microsoft to write a book on same. But, alas, they rarely do this. MSIE's version of Javascript is contemptible. Hail to anyone who refuses to be cowed by their corporate presence, and who uses OpenSource software. These books do a good job for ""standard"" Javascript, so they do serve their purpose rather well."
2,"Great presentation, but that's it",Peachpit's Visual Quickstart Guides are excellent. But you can't learn JavaScript from this book. You can copy what's already there but you won't understand it. Programming concepts are either glossed over or ignored and there just aren't enough examples for everyday applications.
1,Not a book for programmers!,"I bought this book when I worked as a Web Developer during last summer which involved lots of both server side and client side programming. This book DOES NOT explain the core concepts in Javascript eg. the DOM - Document Object Model, the proper way of writing cookies, and omits too much what a programer has to know. It only give you some examples and expect you to understand the whole concept. I believe any of the tutorials online is MUCH better than this book."
2,"Poorly formatted code, doesn't teach concepts","I tried to use this book in my classes but found it lacking. It presents a lot of techniques but doesn't teach the concepts well. There is a lot of code but the formatting is inconsistent with haphazard line breaks and wraps. Many of my students inadvertently entered extra line breaks which made their code break. For code intensive books, the full width of the page is needed and the display should mirror that of a typical text editor. All the HTML tags in the book are in upper case whereas students today need to get in the habit of writing lowercase tags for compatibility with XHTML and XML in the future. If you are serious about learning good programming habits, this book is not for you."
2,Disappointing,"This is terrible for the VQS series. Although it has very useable and everday scripts in it, the authors really don't teach the javascript. They just show you a bunch of the functions together for you to copy and paste into your webpage. I suggest getting the O'Reilly book ""Designing with Javascript"" by Nick Heinle if you want to LEARN javascript."
1,Garbage. . .,"This book is not a resource for programmers or even those who are learning to program-- it is ok if you are too lazy or clueless to swipe a script from another site, but if you want to learn the how and why of JavaScript it is a total waste. . . Buy a reference guide and work through it. . ."
1,"If you want to actually learn JavaScript, look elsewhere.","This book (2nd edition) is fine if all you want is some examples to copy and your target audience uses nothing but Netscape Navigator. It covers practically nothing concerning syntax. Even after downloading the authors' scripts and running them (without changing a thing) on IE 4.0, a great deal of them failed. Worse yet, after running some with Navigator, one failed and the accompanying images didn't load! I didn't bother to check if the image names were entered incorrectly or just plain missing, but I don't think I should have to check the authors' work for accuracy when they are supposed to be teaching me."
1,Incomprehensable,"I bought this book based on the wonderfull book HTML4 for the World Wide Web by Elizabeth Castro, published by the same people. I guess that was my first mistake. Unlike Miss Castro's book, this book gives scripts that would be ver usefull, if they told you what to enter. Even using the same exact scripts that are in the book, a browser will not read them. Instead of substituting words to be replaced to fit your own content, you get cryptic entries like parent.content.document.location.href with no explanation of what they mean, or what should go in them. I hope if a third edition is released that adresses this, there will offer free copys to all unfortunate people who wated theyr money on this book. I think i'll go buy JavaScript for Dummies..."
1,whose torture device is this?,"My first day with this book and already I want to rip it up into itty-bitty pieces. The scripts are printed so small I can barely make them out, and when I apply my own images, I can't even get them to work. I wanted to learn to write my own scripts, but this book is concerned with spreading their own around your web pages. They also try and write humorously but fail most of the time. Try another manual first."
4,Good Beginner Book.,This is a good beginners book. Didn't get into really detailed programming but it covers enough for anyone starting out.
4,"Limited in scope, but a useful book.","I've read this one from cover to cover. I like it a lot. However, you should know it doesn't really teach JavaScript programming. Instead, it gives you a number of excellent scripts and explains how they work. It probably shouldn't be the only book in your Javascript library, but it should be one of them."
2,Not a good book,"This book is very difficult to use if you work with MS IE. Almost every comment in the first few chapters discusses only what works on Netscape and Mac. I stopped reading after a few chapters. (This is really a one star rating, but Amazon didn't post my first comment with one star, so let's try two stars)."
5,Great Book for beginners!,"I am originally from Russia but now I live in USA. I know HTML and I want to learn programming languages for the Web. I just got to the chapter 3 in this book. But I love to read it like some very interesting story. Very clear, easy language and explanation. It is first book about Java Script what really helps me to understand very small but very important details in programming what any beginner needs. This details I didn't study in my school so I had very hard time understand how to program. I want to say THANK YOU very much for Tom Negrino and Dori Smith. Great book, great help for people who wants to learn Java Script!"
3,Wouldn't Recommend It,"This book is not really for beginners. Actually, its for people who want to learn a couple uses for javascript fast. The format is setup in the following way: There is a brief introduction; several examples of javascript are given; the parts of these examples are then described in a brief comprehensible manner. I have some other Visual Quickstart books, and they were quite satisfactory- especially HTML For the World Wide Web. The formats of these books are similar if not exact. The only difference is that HTML For the World Wide Web gives you sufficient information to create your own webpages easily and fairly effectively. The fact that it takes an extremely large book to cover the majority of javascript may account for my distaste towards this book. Once again, if you want to learn the majority of javascript- and have lots of time- I'd recommend a book like the Javascript Bible."
4,Good book for newbies like me!!!,"I like the VSQ series. Hope my eyesight remains good in the next few years though...The prints are getting smaller and smaller...But the content is good. Direct. Clear. Practical. You get results straight away! There's nothing worse than reading long winding pages and only to find out that you can't implement what you've just read onto the web site. With this book, at least you don't feel so...stupid!And hey! the book is cheap !!!Thanks Dori.Kien Caoxuan from Cherrybrook Sydney Australia"
4,It was great! You can teach yourself JavaScript quickly!,"I thought that it was a really good book. I read thru the chapters and topics that I needed to and without any prior knowledge of JavaScript, I added JavaScript methods to my web pages that did input field validations and corrected the text of other input fields.I did want more of an explanation of some methods, and so I wonder what the next book is. I wasn't sure of the syntax of some of the methods and I had to guess when the errors occurred. I wanted to see sample JavaScript code in the book that was contained comprehensive examples.However, there was an excellent tree structure in the back of the book that told what types of methods or event handlers or properties each type of object understands (windows, forms, radio buttons, text fields, etc)."
5,This is a great book with great examples......,This is a great learning or reference book. I used this book in the begining to learn some of the Javascript basics... and I still use this book as reference now.
2,"Disorganized Visual Guide, thank god for the website!","I unfortunately recommended this book to my students because of the lack of other beginner books at the time. The visual organization of code stumped the entire class because its presentation was discontinuous. In addition, some of the code was not working with current technology and the cross-browser examples were not cross-browser, not to mention not cross-platform.The good news was that the book has all the code on a website with the images of the examples available for download and that saved the day. Had I known, I would have NOT bought the book and just used the website as a tutorial."
5,Practical and Understandable Reference,"If you want to learn to apply JavaScript quickly, this is the book for you. The authors provide clear, concise explanations in an easy-to-read format. Non-programmers will find this book a God-send! I continue to use it as a reference (along with JavaScript The Definitive Guide by O'Reilly and Assoc.) on nearly every project. I agree with the previous reviewer that you should have both the first and second editions because they both contain valuable information!"
3,"For the price and the claim, good buy","For the price, you get a well-laid out book of a few popular javascript ""scripts"". This is not a good book for learning the language. It clarifies ""a few"" popular scripts for those who cut and paste code. If that's what you want, it's a very good buy."
3,Why hast thou forsaken JavaScript?!?!,"Ok, so here is how to do something cool with your website in JavaScript. Oh, it doesn't work quite the way you want, you say? Well too bad - here is another cool thing you can do with JavaScript.Thats pretty much how your experience is going to be it you buy this book with the intention that it will teach you JavaScript. This book should not be used as a teaching tool. It may be useful for the individual who wants to see how some interesting things are done in JS, but the examples given are all pretty much standard examples with no variations given. It would be nice to see something different than what is available for free on the web. In this books defense it does do a good job of explaining the examples, but I would recommend it as a companion, not as a standalone teaching tool. If you get this book I would highly recommend taking a look at a good refrence like Wrox's Instant JavaScript, good read and full of good code."
1,NOT FOR NON-PROGRAMMERS!,"In spite of the assurance in the book's introduction ""We don't assume that you know anything about programming or scripting"" you need to have a programming background to get value out of this book. I know HTML and a little JavaScript, and I was lost by chapter 2. Chapter 2 has a ridiculously steep learning curve, along with important points left unexplained (for example brackets are used in one script, with no explanation for the significance of brackets, when they should be used, etc.)I've always been a big fan of Peachpit Press's books - this is the first time I was severely disappointed by one. I felt like a complete moron by the time I got to the end of chapter 2. In spite of years of teaching college courses in business and graphics applications, I was beginning to think - ""am I just too stupid to learn programming?""And I agree with another reviewer here about the irritating style. It adds insult to injury."
3,Thumbs down for function,"It looks nice, but the spout always drips or spills a little tea when pouring. Therefore it didn't meet the quality standards I expected from Le Creuset."
4,Cheap but works fine,"The handle is a cheap piece of plastic/rubber and not super comfortable. Other than that, it's a pretty simple tool I've had no problems with."
4,breaker bar review,product came in a timely manner. I am impressed with it's quality construction. I think it is a very good value for the price. all in all I am very happy with my half inch breaker bar.
3,Call me old fashioned...,"Gone are the days when the womenfolk were happy with a nice frock and a husband with a steady income. These days the ladies all seem to want to be one of these new-fangled fancy ""stereotypes"" that are all the rage. It may come as a surprise to the author that there are some women who cannot be fitted into any one of these fashionable ""stereotypes"", and instead prefer a combination of several of them. I give this book 3 stars, as it seems well put together, but I wouldn't advise any of the ladyfolk to be reading this kind of thing, since it could give them ideas."
3,Go read it in the bookstore!,"The Guerilla Girls are cool. I am not disputing that. I am also not disputing that what they say in this book is true. It is.I just wouldn't waste my money on it. It's sort of like cotton candy. By the time you're halfway through eating it, you're sick to your stomach and mad you wasted your money. There's nothing new in this book. It's not very indepth; on the contrary, I found it too simplistic.Instead of calling it ""intelligent,"" I would call it ""cute."" It might be okay for someone who is ""just starting out"" in feminism, so to speak, but if you've read a dozen books or more it's going to be the same old same old and you probably won't like it.I didn't buy it. I read it sitting in the bookstore. And I'm glad I didn't waste my money."
2,Not very indepth.,"I picked up this book because of a review in Bust magazine. I was disappointed -- the book offered no insights, just tired old rehash of things we've all heard before.It seems like the writers forgot about stereotypes and just wrote essays about women who have been treated like crap. It reads like ""News of the Weird"" instead of thoughtful commentary on our society.This book's intentions were good, but the whole thing is pretty brainless. I wish that weren't so."
2,Not what I Expected,I believe I was looking for something different. This book did not fill my expectations. The studies that were completed were not the type of studies I expected from this book. I had to makes notes and take very short tests and answer questions. Not for me. To involved; I felt I should have been in a classroom taking this as extracurricular for credits.
3,"Good Ideas, Poorly writen.","Good Ideas, Poorly written.The Book has some good Ideas and concepts. Is poorly written, to many examples of peoples experiences that don't really add to a ""Scientific"" Investigation.If you think you have Bad Luck this book will give you hoppe."
3,The Luck Factor,So far I understand the first essentital principle and why some people make their own luck. It's not me so I'm reading the other 3 essentital priniciples and I hope I fall into another catagory.
5,Fantastic,This book is fantastic. It's not only an interesting read but brings to light a lot of great points to what 'luck' really is.
3,"Acceptable for leisure reading on psychology, but definitely not to be treated as a work of serious science","If you want to read a book that would increase your luck in casinos or lotteries, please give this one a pass. However, if you want some reinforcements for your positive thinking and doing, it's readable. Personally I agree with the power of positive thinking and doing. My reservation about this book, as you can sense it, primarily comes from the illogical and unscientific research methodology the author adopted to prove the luck principles he himself brought forward, not to mention that the principles in themselves are quite broken and ill defined. In short, acceptable for leisure reading on psychology, but definitely not to be treated as a work of serious science."
2,"A program for living, not research about luck.","The book disappointed me. There is no definition of what luck is or how it can be measured. Luck in this book doesn't have anything to do with chance events. People who think they are happy, self satisified, and consider themselves lucky, are lucky. They answer some questionaires about themselves in the same way. Unlucky people have common answers too and get lower scores. But Dr. Wiseman doesn't give his tests to random people and check how well the test measure luck in the general sense (for example does indebtedness correlate well with high scores). You get to rate yourself against his pool of data to see if you're lucky or unlucky. Finally, there are some exercises you can do that will help you improve your lot in life, and thereby your luck or is it the other way around. The advice is quite sensible and easy to follow, but it's not going to help you draw to an inside straight the next time you need to."
1,Don't waste your time.,This is one of the most amateurish books I have ever come across. The content as well as the writing style are just bad and almost childish. A highschool student would write better than this. I was totally dismayed at such a poor treatment of the subject especially by a professional doctor.
3,Something Is Missing!,"Only the most hardcore scientific materialist would assert, as Dr. Wiseman does, that luck is nothing more than a byproduct of our behaviors and attitudes. That undoubtedly plays a role, but to get another perspective I turned to a new book, LUCKY YOU!, by Fitzgerald, that tells a deeper, more complex and interesting story about streaks of good and bad luck. He goes far beyond Wiseman by examining, from his own experiences, from observations of others, and from the latest parapsychological research, how intuition can shape good fortune through our dreams, our attention to patterns of synchronicities,and even how we are influenced by a spiritual dimension of luck that involves the belief systems we construct around meditation practices and prayer. Contrast both books and judge for yourself which comes closer to your own personal truth."
2,Fortune cookie philosophy,"Though based on academic research, this book has the kind of self-help pop psych style that I personally find extremely annoying. It compares people who self-describe as lucky or unlucky, and shows this is associated with a range of other aspects of positive or negative attitudes to life. Well duh. Their concluding principles? Maximize chance opportunities, listen to your intuition, expect good fortune, see the positive side of misfortune. Is this an improvement over fortune cookie philosophy?"
1,A feeble attempt,"Starting out as an intellectual study, it quickly devolves into a 'new-agey' blather. A waste of money & time."
4,Really Cool!,This book is an amazing book! It changes your whole look on life. I would strongly reccommend it to anyone because the ideas presented in it are so interesting. I have never heard of such far-out yet possible ideas. A great read!
3,Adds little to the game,"There is a classic Chinese story that goes like this: a group of people were in competition to see who can draw a snake the fastest. The winner gets a prize. A person drew the snake really fast and by the time he finished everyone else was still going. So he added four legs to his picture. Of course he didn't win the prize because what he drew was not a snake any more.High bohn feels like those four legs. Bohnanza by itself was a fun game and it had simple rules. The added features of High bohn, the buildings, ruined the simplistic nature of the game. The ""Plus"" component adds a nice little feature to the game in the form of order cards, but it really isn't necessary. If I play Bohnanza again, I will not use the High Bohn expansion."
5,A nice addition,The buildings add a nice fun element to an already fun game. Some of the abilities the building give you can really change the game.
5,One of The 10 Greatest CD's Of All Time,"This disc shows just how fabulous rock 'n' roll can be. Cory Glover's vocals are stunningly expressive. Vernon Reid's guitar is genious. The lyrics to songs shed true light on the human condition and in some cases insspire: ""THIS IS THE LIFE YOU HAVE!!!"" Oh ... and it will rock your socks off. If you can't groove to this disc, you ain't got no groove."
3,A poor second to their incredible first album,"Afraid I have to disagree with the other reviews.Vivid is one of my favourite albums of all time. Time's Up was a huge dissappointment - largely in the production, which lacked the 'balls' of the first album, but also in the songwriting which wasn't as strong...A tragedy that they disbanded, though - definitely one of the bands of the decade..."
1,Living tosh,"Absolute Tosh of the highest order, wow man this sucks bigtime, why did they not get lessons and a proper drummer?????????. This so called Blackrock is about as rock as my Toothpaste. Ok for a coaster i suppose."
4,pretty cool.,"these guys have really great begginings and ends to their songs. which really makes the fundamentals of a good song. They all do what they are meant to do and they do it well. no-one is stealing all the attention here, which is good. i don't know about the best album of the 90's, many true classics that are (only marginally) better than this were made in the 90's."
4,Enough good songs to avoid the sophmore slump,"The best way to sum up this review is if you liked the first record, 'Vivid' (1988), you will probably like the follow-up 'Time's Up' (1990), although sophmore efforts being as they are, it certainly does not sound as fresh.What makes this effort worth buying is the strength of the singles - the upbeat, understated ""Solace of You""; the hard-rocking ""Type"" (counterpoint to REM's ""It's the End of the World As You Know It""); and the tongue-in-cheek ""Love Rears Its Ugly Head"". Other standouts include the funky ditty ""Elvis Is Dead"" (complete with guest vocals by Little Richard and a groovy sax solo) and the Zepplenesque finale ""This Is the Life"".The rest of the record does not work as well. With several songs (""Someone Like You"", ""New Jack Theme"", ""Pride"", ""Time's Up""), the band goes way too far trying to reproduce the musical style and socially conscious lyrics of a previous single, ""Open Letter"", creating what is nothing more than filler."
1,"If you are a developer, forget it.",This book is only a sales pitch for P2P. They use many pages defining P2P and many more to explain why it is so great.From the description I was expecting some insight into programming applications using P2P. I was very disappointed.
4,Good coverage of the topic,"Anyone who liked _Thinking in Jazz_, another Paul Berliner book, will probably enjoy _Soul of Mbira_. It takes a similar approach, looking at the history, sociology, tradition and musical nature of the Shona mbira (also known as the kalimba, sanzhi, likembe, or 'thumb piano' - though after you hear Paul's comments on the latter name, you won't want to use it again).Other musical instruments by the Shona are also covered, but to a much lesser degree. The section on performance is nice, but it is the part which suffers most from 'dancing about architecture' syndrome.The appendix on 'building and playing your own mbira' is informative, but unless you have access to an anvil and fire, not very practical! It isn't hard to modify the design and make your own anyway, though, it just won't be as traditional."
5,You'll Profet By This Book,"Let's not kid ourselves: we'd all like to know more about sex. Well, look no further. Dressed up as a so-called ""academic"" book about human sexuality, this is an extremely hot book about the steamy things dudes and ladies do. Okay, just kidding -- it is very acadmeic, and a lot of scholarly work went into it. But I dare you to say it didn't make you somewhat aroused. There's all kind of dirty stuff in it, and in my opinion, that's what makes a great book truly great. I look forward to the sequel."
3,Not usual Harold Robbins quality,"I read this book many years ago, and wanted to reread a Harold Robbins book when I got my Kindle. Mr. Robbins was my favorite author for many many years. However, I think this novel was not equal to his usual writing. It just didn't do it for me."
4,No answer guide,"While this book is very good at what it does, teach you about PC hardware to prepare you for the A+ exam, it gives self test exams after each chapter without providing the answers. If you don't mind thumbing through the chapter to verify your answers you will probably like this book. It's a pity rhis information wasn't included in the description of this book. I called McGraw Hill's customer service and they simply stated there is no answer guide to this book. You're on your own. The same holds true with Mike Meyer's A+ guide to Operating Systems."
2,I passed,"I passed the hardware exam on my first try. However, it did not have a great amount to do with this book. Although the book helped me feel confident about my knowledge it did not teach me anything new that I needed for the exam. The book seemed more geared to what Mike Meyers thinks a technician should know about PCs more than what CompTIA thinks a computer technician should know.I am a little more uncomfortable about the operating systems test and will not rely only on the Mike Meyers book to prepare me for it. I will use the Meyers book in conjunction with A+ certification for dummies."
3,Just the Facts please,"I would have appreciated this resource better if his ego was left out of the writing - too many opinions and too much humor. I don't care to learn about the personality of the author, I am more interested in the content, the raw knowledge for which I am paying, presented in a clean, professional and efficient manner.This level of mediocrity will prepare you for the poorly written Comptia A+ Tests."
4,"""BILL EVENS AT HIS BEST""","2 DIFFERENT RYTHMN SECTION'S. THEIR GOOD,BUT BILL IS EXCELLENT! GREAT TUNES,""NARDIS"",""AUTUMN LEAVES"",""VERY EARLY"",""STELLA BY STARLIGHT"" 7 MORE +INTERVIEW."
3,Nice but uncomfortable,"Shoe is very nice, but they are very uncomfortable to wear. I looked like a ballerina with injured toes the first time I wore them, since I had to bandage my toes to walk for the rest of the day, since I was at work."
5,Thrilled with this shoe,"I ordered the black patent leather shoes after seeing them at Macys for twice the price. They are gorgeous (my husband even complemented me, and he never notices my shoes!) I paid for 2 day shipping which was reasonable, and got them 24 hours after ordering them! Incredible"
1,A Waste of Money and Effort,"I couldn't wait to use these. I love the idea of cleaning in an environmentally friendly manner. Unfortunately, these didn't work at all.I got the two-pack, and put one in each toilet in my home. I cleaned each toilet first, to start fresh. Within a month, both toilets were disgusting. Worse than they had ever been before.I have no idea what went wrong. A big disappointment."
4,Great for hard water,"I have used these before, and they are a great way to minimize mineral stains without using chemicals in your toilet if you have a pet that, ahem, may use the toilet as a water source. Plus it makes cleaning quicker and easier."
2,Not as rated,This product got glowing reviews from the majority written. It doesn't keep the bowl clean .... perhaps we have extremely hard water?.....at any rate....I'm disappointed and will go back to a drop-in tablet although they tend to corrode the fittings in the tank/ I chose this particular product over other chem-free cleaners because of online reviews. Buyer beware.
3,Can't really tell,"We don't have calcium deposit issues with our toilets, despite being in a fairly hard water area, so I guess I can't really tell if it's working or not. I still see stains developing, unfortunately, which at first I thought it would also combat. Perhaps I still need a real drop in tablet treatment."
1,Only good for some,It's a magnet inside a plastic box. It may well help for people who get rust stains. But it did nothing for the mold growth that is MY problem!
1,Useless,"I don't know how these work on hard water stains. For maintaining cleanliness of the toilet bowl, they are useless, in my experience. I felt very ripped off by bogus claims."
2,OK,"These may help keep your toilet a little cleaner, but you still have to clean with a brush and toilet bowel cleaner every week or so. All in all, I would not repurchase."
1,Snake Oil,"Just like some have said in other reviews, these are just magnets inside plastic containers, so how could they possibly do anything? I figured it didn't hurt to try them out.Yep. They're worthless. Save your money and buy some pet rocks to put in your toilet bowl. It'll probably be more effective."
1,Waste of money,"On the surface, this product appears to be a fine idea. The reality is I wasted money purchasing it. It does NOT work as advertised."
1,ChemFree ToiletClean Non-toxic Toilet Bowl Cleaner,used ! but no result.. very disappointed!it sound and discript so well but is not true!anyway lucky not too costly!
1,Polar Express,"DO NOT BUY THIS CD ROM. YOU ARE WASTING YOUR MONEY. This product made by THQ, priced at $19.99, for my grandson for Christmas 2004, is still sitting on his CD shelf. I installed it on our new computer and then un-installed it. The software is very poor. I have purchased approximately 50 CD ROMs for my grandson and never had problems like I had with Polar Express.It was very difficult to install. I called Customer Support and they told me I needed to install an additional video and sound card on my NEW top of the line Dell computer. I could tell the representative did not know what they were talking about, because this was the same thing they told me when I called Customer Support when I had problems installing the software on my old HP computer. Forget about getting help on their website. Basically, we have a pretty Polar Express box sitting on our CD shelf."
1,Great Graphics but Poor Design,"This is a very frustrating game. This reminds me of the first Harry Potter game where there is one section of the game in the beginning which is very challenging. Once you get past that first part, the rest of the game is fun. Except getting past the first part in Polar Express game is harder than playing Half Life and much less rewarding. It is really sad because the graphics in this game are very nice. The game has the potential to be absolutely fantastic. Instead, it will just drive you nuts."
1,Awful software,"This software makes it extremely difficult to grab objects, then penalizes the frustrated child by preventing the child from saving the game (because the child can't progress far enough to have earned the ability to save a game).Avoid this software."
1,this game even looks boring!!!!,when i bought it i was so excited (i hoped it would be better than the movie) it wasnt. it was worse. i go bored in about an hour. i traded it for shark tale on gamecube. it was sooooo much better. buy anything but the polar express.
1,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE,"I bought this game for my son and found it extremely frustrating, to say the least. You have to complete the first game before you can go on to the the next game. You cannot pick and choose. Also, you cannot save the level you are on. You have to start over and over again. THE MAKERS OF THIS GAME SHOULD BE UTTERLY ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES FOR MAKING THIS GARBAGE IN ORDER TO MAKE SOME MONEY."
4,Magical Drop Pocket Is Extremely Addictive,"I purchased a NGP System just to get this game, which has been my Arcade Favorite for many years now. The Conversion is not lacking much, and the game features many of the Characters from the Magical Drop Series. The gameplay modes are varied, and theres always Self-Challange Mode in Hardest level which is a feat you may never accomplish. (I did however!)... I've yet to try the 2 player link mode, but I'm hoping to one day.This game knocks the socks off Tetris!"
2,Exercises in Physical Geology,This is the longest most technical book I have ever seen without any kind of index. Whoever thought that was alright for a textbook should have to go back to school and try to use it. The illustrations are useful but difficult to find without an index.
5,great condition,I received my order when promised and it was in great condition . I would definitely do business again . It was better than working with my school's online bookstore who sent me the wrong book and they sent It late.
2,seemed like fun...,"this game seemed like a good idea but it broke the first time we used it. My child continued to play with the ""pearls"" (they float) but we used the rest of it as a dog-doo scooper."
3,Could be better,"I bought this game because I remembered playing it as a kid in my grandma's pool. This version is much larger than the one we had back then. It is fun for the kids, but the problem with it is the clam keeps coming apart. They could have made the clam a little better. Also, they made it so the balls can float, but the problem with that is that is makes the entire thing float. The point of the game is to try to dive for the pearls and takes quite a bit to get it to sink, it kind of makes the game hard."
4,Nice Memories,"I bought this for my father whose music collection included this album set in cassette and his new car had only a CD player.He was thrilled.Good remastering to digital, sounds better than the cassettes or the vinyl for that matter, and he is a happy man.Says this is 'his and mom's music'.A great gift for Older Americans who grew up on the music of America's Heartland."
2,Just a reading list...,"With a title like ""The battle for..."" you might expect an authoritative overview of various viewpoints regarding some of the contentious and even elusive events and actions of World War two. This ain't that. John Keegan is the best military historian I know, and I've read about a dozen of his books. But this is just a list of suggested reading and would've made a useful appendix to one of his other wonderful books."
4,"A must for devotees of the ""Big One""","The preeminent military historian of this century writes his short reading list for the ""Big One"". This small book(118 pages) is divided in 6 chapters; Controversies, Histories, Biographies, Campaigns, A chapter on Technology, and Occupied Europe. In each Keegan reviews the books that he regards as critical to the understanding of that aspect of the war. Devotees of the War and its history can now compare their libraries to his, and update their reading list"
2,Disappointing for what it leaves out,"John Keegan's brilliance is occasionally seen in cameo form here, with his usual facility for the telling phrase and sharp insight. But the problem is that the book does not go very far. There are many important and/or interesting works which are not even mentioned - one thinks of the official South African history of the Sidi Rezeg battles and Alamein in the Western Desert in 1941, by Agar-Hamilton and Turner. Accustomed as we are to Keegan's astonishing range, it is disappointing to see such a slight work by him. He also seems reluctant to assess the place of the huge number of personal biographies (some academic, some popular) of generals from the various armies."
4,A useful reading list,"As other reviewers have noted, this book is somewhat inaccurately titled. However, that's just about the only thing wrong with it.In 'The Battle for History' John Keegan divides the massive literature on the Second World War into five themes; histories of the war, biographies of the key players, campaign histories, books about how the military forces were supplied and lead and books about the experiences of countries occupied by hostile forces. Keegan then provides a succinct summary of the main issues and events which fall within each theme, nominating what he personally considers to be the best book on each of these topics.While this approach does not even begin to resemble a comprehensive bibliography, Keegan's recommendations tend to be interesting, well chosen and worthy of further investigation. All up, for its relatively modest price this book is a useful guide for readers who are new to the war and readers who have read widely, but not as widely as Keegan, on the topic."
1,Misleading,"This book is a shameless attempt on the part of the publisher and the author to trade on Keegan's reputation and the great general interest in WWII. The title and subtitle to this book leads readers to expect a historiography of WWII. Instead, this is a short bibliographic essay on important books on WWII. While Keegan's recommendations are useful, this slight book is not worth spending money on unless you can buy it at a steep discount. This is the kind of information that should appear at the back of a decent one volume history and which I suspect is absent from Keegan's book on WWII."
2,How good is his historiography?,"I found Keegan's ""The Battle for History"" a dissapointing effort. It is basically a summary of WW2 historiography. This would be very useful indeed if done well, but ""Battle"" falls short. Firstly, Keegan omits many important works in his historiography (those of B.H. Liddell Hart and J.F.C. Fuller for example), and if that weren't enough, Keegan even confuses Guderian's ""Panzer Leader"" and ""Achtung!-Panzer"" as being the very same book! (see page 58) Unforgivable"
2,New name and description would help out a lot.,"This book is simply a list of other books. The ""description"" of the book seems great. It talks about controversies with Pearl Harbor, and etc. However there are merely just 3 lines in the entire book on these controversies like Pearl Harbor. Keegan just states a book title, and gives a line or two, and then gives another book. It just was not what I expected from the description. If I would have realized it was a big ""list of other books"" I would have chose something with informational content of WWII.If you are already a huge WWII itellectual and looking for other books, then it is a great list. But I think something went wrong when the editors was naming the book and writing the description."
2,Isn't this a solo?,"I am a big Mac Dre fan, but this cd isn't up to the level I expect from him. Too many guest spots and not enough of MD himself (for my tastes at least) still its better than 90% of releases this year, which really isn't saying too much considering lame artists ruling rap at this time."
2,take me out of the bathtub,product was suppose to be new and i dont think it was there was indentations on the front and on the inside was a sticker from a school. The book was still ok but it was suppose to be brand new.
2,Spend your money elsewhere,"First, I think for really young kids, the 'joke' of this CD will be lost - they don't know the original songs that are being parodied so to them, it's just songs.Second, the songs aren't even that catchy. If you really stop and listen to them, the lyrics are imaginative, but overall, after listening to it in the kitchen while getting dinner ready one night, we all tuned them out after about five minutes. We left it playing, but no song ever grabbed out attention. We turned it back toThe Backyardigans: Born To Playwhich my son and us all sing along with."
2,there are better options than this,"I understand that my musical tastes are different than children's, but I couldn't make it through more than 3 or 4 tracks of this CD before I had to turn it off. The musical and vocals are amateurish. I thought the parodies might be a little more clever, but they are mostly silly and I lost interest pretty quickly. My daughter is only 6 months old, so I can't really ask her what she thinks right now. Maybe the lyrics really speak to the preschool and primary school set, but I'm not sure I will be able to bring myself to listen to it again with her when she's older. In my opinion, there are a lot of better choices for children's music out there than this. You can find plenty of music that appeals to kids and is bearable and even enjoyable for adults."
2,Less than amusing,"These songs may be clever and set to traditional nursery tunes, but they are not memorable lyrics. The music itself isn't as catchy as other children's music on the market. When faced with a choice between Laurie Berkner or this CD, I would choose Berkner. My kids would be more likely to get up and dance to her, They Might Be Giants, or any other popular child's CD over this album as well."
4,A great book,"This book has a bunch of silly songs like they made ""take me out to the ball game"" into ""take me out of the bathtub."" The art is super silly and cool. They have 2 or 3 songs that I don't know the tune or the words but it's still fun and great."
5,Let your kids laugh!,"We're constantly nagging our kids about what to do and what not to do; what to say and what not to say. If you've taught your children well enough they will be able to take this book with light humor and not turn it into ""potty talk"" and ""bad behavior"". Yes, it has a picture of a (cartoon) little boy's naked butt flying out of the tub. Is it dirty? No - it's quite accurate. I don't know about you but my kids don't wear bathing suits in the bathtub. And as far as stinky diaper change goes... that's our favorite song right now because we have a new baby in the house and his 4 year old big brother loves me to sing it when I'm changing the baby's diaper.Afraid of the food fight song? Have a picnic outside and LET the kids have a food fight. What's the big deal? Let them be kids. Let yourself be a kid again.Let the kids laugh a little. They have many years ahead of them to be grown up and politically correct.OUR RATING: We think this book is GREAT!"
2,Just mediocre,"As you can gather, this is just mediocre. Familiar tunes with different lyrics. Although nice to listen to at first, one wonders why the lyrics have to be different. Children tend to customize songs to their little mind's whims so I failed to see why we need to do it for them."
4,Gets the kids laughing,"I am an aunt and I love to hear my niece and nephew laugh. This was a great product for them because it got them laughing and acting silly - like the kids they are. The tunes are easily recognizable to the adults, so they can sing along and the whole family can have fun."
5,Take the kids to poetry,"I'm a teacher, and this book was a huge hit with my students during a reading clinic I helped teach. One boy declared that he didn't like rhyme before I introduced the book and really got into it after I had him read it anyway...he even performed one of the poems for the class!!!"
3,Only Went So Far and So Long with the Kids,"How many of us have made up silly songs or grew up with silly songs made from other tunes? It was a constant staple of entertainment back in school days; however, for our three and six year olds, the fun lasted barely, only the first time through the CD.Alan Katz does a good job with the 14 songs which are indeed amusing and clever. The kids picked out a few of the silliest of lines and liked, at least initially, the bouncy, familiar tunes. It's listed for 4-8 year olds, but I kept thinking perhaps older kids or adults might relate better to this. Or not.Maybe, it's a matter of taste, but much like a joke once heard the pizzaz is gone. The children didn't want more, kept asking for Michael Jackson or Disney tunes."
2,Not that silly dilly,"To quote my 3-year-old, ""These songs aren't that silly."" A couple are clever over a child's head, but most are just okay - and all are written for boys. I'm also not a fan of the intro and exit tracks that remind you what you're listening to (like an audiobook). To be fair, Alan Katz's voice is smooth and spot-on-key, it's the songs themselves that are just meh."
3,"Probably will not be on ""repeat"" in our house!","First let me say I am very picky about the kids can listen to. With that being said, my husband and I found some of these songs gross and inappropriate for repetition. The diaper song, in particular was played once and then skipped the few other times we listened to the CD. I don't mind silly songs, but my kids didn't like them, either. Our 5.5 year old said, ""They just don't make any sense, Mom."" Even our middle child who is just shy of 4 didn't have any interest in listening to the CD again and he likes potty humor and goofy lyrics. We will be sticking to Raffi. I gave it 3 out of 5 stars because there is nothing ""WRONG"" with the CD, and I did like that the instrumental versions are available after the versions with lyrics. We just listen to the instrumentals and make up our own songs."
3,"Kids love it. Me, not so much","I have a pretty high tolerance for all things kid-related. As the mom of 2 autistic kids who hang onto a trend LONG past its expiration date, I am used to tuning out the horribly annoying things marketed to kids.That being said, my kids love this CD (I hesitate to call it an audiobook as that seems to imply some sort of storyline). I really, really don't. The singing and music are so awful that I just can't enjoy the silly songs with my kids. I cringe every time they request this in the car. The lyrics are great and we are already a fan of Alan Katz but in the future we will stick to singing his songs ourself out of the books rather than getting the CD version."
3,Bubbly friendly and ready for sing a longs,The collection of songs is a cute little refreshment of music for your little one. The voice quality is better than expected and better than a lot of the other singing voices used in the children's music world. The cd itself does not load the song titles or information at all when you import it into itunes. The songs are creative but based on tunes that allow you to sing along to them. I would recommend this cd if you like wee sing silly songs.
4,Kids like the songs,This is a cute CD. My two nieces and myself were laaughing while listening to this CD. They keep asking me to put it on so that they can memorize the songs. Very cute music and think other small children will be entertained by this CD.
3,Finally Can Hear How These are Meant to be Read...,"I have a couple of Alan Katz's books and one of the shortcomings is I can't always make sense of how he's paired the rhyme to the tune.When I saw this cd come up on Vine, I picked it up hoping that it would be an amusing listen.The biggest upside is I now know how the words and tune are supposed to go to together.That said, the singer's voice is a little dull for me and the music, I swear, is little more than a Casio keyboard (no offense Casio).It's pretty low in production quality even by the standards of inexpensive kids' cds.The lyrics are priceless but for 'musical' value my final vote is 'meh'."
2,Dumb songs,"This is just a CD. There's no book, lyrics, or anything else. I don't know why, but I was expecting more. In any case, the songs are pretty much as advertised (""silly dilly"") but for our family we just found them more annoying than nails on a chalkboard. Sorry."
1,The worst. Torture for kids and adults alike,"My kids grew up on WEE SING, Raffi, Alan Sherman, and Weird Al Yankovich, with various kiddie folk artists thrown in for fun. I have listened to hundreds of hours of kiddie music - Christian, folk, nursery rhymes, silly songs...and this is THE WORST collection I've ever heard. I was going to give it to my god-daughter when i was finished listening but I've changed my mind. I wouldn't torture her (or her parents) with this.Middle-aged, semi-talented persons make up really stupid words to familiar tunes. Spare your child, and yourself."
2,Cheesy - but not in a silly dilly way,"First off - I am a little confused. There seems to be some confusion if this is a book, an audio CD.... or both. I received an audio cd without a book. For the price that is a reasonable expectation - but other reviewers are pretty clear in that they were reading a book.Now onto the review of the Audio CD.I guess silly dilly songs are in the eyes of the beholder. While we found a couple of the songs cute we (my family) struggled to find the charm in many others. The audio quality was a detriment since most of the songs (if not all) were done on a synthesizer. It gives most of the songs a mid-80's feel. While some of the lyrics are cute and funny many of lyrics don't seem to have the appropriate rhythm.Final Verdict - I would recommend downloading a couple of the songs to make sure that your kids enjoy the songs prior to purchasing.2 1/2 Stars"
2,"Nice illustrations, but that's where it stops","The illustration were very good in this book, but the 'silly dilly songs' were a big dissapointment. Some lines were just taken out of thin air with very little thought behind them - I know it's supposed to be silly, but these weren't. My 7 year old did not find them amusing,, but perhaps a 4 year old might."
1,Charmless,"If you will permit me to be blunt, this book is nothing but a charmless gross-out with nauseating pictures and junk words. The book got one mild giggle out of us when we went through it, my 3 year old daughter and me. The author, purportedly a ""songwriter and comedy writer extraordinaire,"" (from the cover) needs to ply his trade somewhere else besides books for 2-6 year olds. His foul humor probably is a hit in seedy adult joints, but do you want to feed that quality of talent to your toddler? Sorry to be so direct in giving the unvarnished true, but I wish I had known and now you can make an informed choice as a buyer."
2,Gross-out Humor -- For Older Kids,"My four-year-old and I were disappointed in this book. Writing funny new words to familiar children's tunes is a great idea, I think, but I thought most of the songs and Mad-magazine-style cartoon illustrations were unpleasant and geared more toward older kids who enjoy ""gross-out"" humor. Topics include food fights (showing toddler completely encrusted with slop), ""stinky stinky diaper change"" (showing baby with clouds of brown steam arising from diaper), ""I'm filthy"" (showing baby wallowing in mud with enormous pigs), and ""I'm so carsick"" (showing green toddler on dirty carseat wincing at dripping slice of pizza). This probably will appeal to many, but did not to us -- we returned it."
1,Very unoriginal and not funny,"This whole series is very unoriginal and not clever or cute. I think children already get enough exposure to stupid bathroom humor without contributing to it at home. Thankfully, even children see through this junk - quickly became the least favorite book in the toy box."
3,"Somewhat amusing lyrics, not for all tastes","The creators of this CD have taken popular songs (e.g., ""I've Been Working on the Railroad"" and ""My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean"") and rewritten the lyrics to appeal to the sense of humor of young children. In other words, they're silly, irreverent and occasionally gross (like a song about dirty diapers). My 4-year-old didn't see the point and I wasn't especially entertained either. A few of the songs are modestly clever, but not enough so to want to listen to them over and over again. I'm not really sure of the point of this collection."
3,Average at best. Only some songs were worth listening to again.,"I said it in the title. Some songs were mildly cute and funny but most seemed like filler content and were not worth listening to even twice. I was really disappointed in the overall experience and shocked how little my 5 year old son who LOVES singing and music and silly songs, barely liked the CD. To be fair we listened to the entire CD 3 different times. He did not ask to here any of them again nor did he act too interested during the songs."
2,Just not impressed,"I wanted to like this CD, but found it to be lacking. On a positive note, the tunes were familiar, but the words were not something I would remember - or want to remember. I'm not sure what age group this music would appeal to. The pre-school set aren't going to understand some of the topics and the older school-age kids are going to find it pretty stupid. Most of all, the parents, who at least need to be able to tolerate it, are not going to want to listen to this for any length of time. The quality of the music is definitely lacking. This could have been made in someone's basement. There is no way I would want to listen to this on a trip in the car."
1,Disappointing,"Frankly I found this cd quite disappointing. I was hoping for some silly, fun songs that my toddler would enjoy but these songs seem to be standard and rather boring common kids songs (Row Your Boat, Twinkle Twinkle, ect.) with the words changed. While an older child may appareciate some of the silly lyrics, I think it will be lost on most children. And the performance of the songs themselves seems very lack-luster, most of them aren't even really sung but rather 'recited' to the tune of the song with a half-hearted adult's voice.If you're looking for fun, silly, creative and inspiring songs to enjoy with your kids I would defintely look elsewhere - I'll take Laurie Berkner or Charlie Hope over this any day."
4,impressive but long,"Sia has such a unique and dynamic voice and she knows how to use it. I also have tons of respect for her songwriting, a talent latent in so many artists today that have albums with their name on it. It's obvious that she actually thinks about what she's writing. Her style is unique and personal. The album is filled with several different kinds of tracks, from soulful ballads, to smoky jazzy R&B, to playful poppy songs. Yet each song is uniquely ""her's."" I really like ""taken for granted,"" ""fear,"" and ""drink to get drunk.""My only problem with this album is that it seems a bit long. The production is lacking on a lot of tracks. Her voice is so powerful and on most tracks the production is not so powerful. So her voice ends up dominating and driving the whole album and after a while it gets kind of annoying. More balance is needed. But other than that, Sia is a unique artist who is obviously going to be around for a while."
4,Voice is Awesome!,Sia has a wonderful voice. I am surprised it took so long for me to find out about this truly gifted singer.
1,"Great voice, but not a great use of it","There's only one song on this entire CD that really highlights the beauty of Sia's voice. Granted, she wrote the songs on this CD after she lost her boyfriend in a car accident -- so you could imagine she was out of it slightly. Her other solo work is better as is her work with Zero 7."
1,I should have listened,"I knew this wouldn't be the Sia from Zero 7's album. Little did I know exactly how bad she could be without the superior talents Zero 7 have behind the mixing boards. The song production is terrible. I couldn't find one song I really liked on this CD. Sia truly has a unique voice but it's evident that good production can make a star out of a flashlight. Still, I'm severely disappointed, particularly because I had to pay for this CD as an import."
4,Fresh Fun at Christmas,"After hearing a Herb Alpert Christmas song on the radio, I looked to see if he had an album. This CD sounds great. It's uplifting and fun and it's a little different from other Christmas albums. I recommend it...you'll enjoy it! Merry Christmas!"
5,Love it!,Herb Alpert and The Tijuana Brass is by far my favorite instrumental group; they have always been. This Christmas album is quite unique. It incorporates their inimitable style as musicians and yet stands alone. I had to have it since I am trying to collect all their music now after so many decades. I cannot really describe any one characteristic which I like best in each song -- it's the collective that counts for me. I will be listening to this CD during the Christmas season for the rest of my life! What I especially liked was the inclusion of the story behind the making of this CD. It was informative as well as interesting. Bravo Herb Alpert - you rocked it.
4,A blast back to my childhood!,"A perfect SoCal 60's/70's Christmas. The TJB were not the best band ever, but you have to admit this is catchy. Great choral arrangements and Herb's soft and sweet voice on a couple of tracks make this a very nice addition to any Christmas collection."
5,Classic Christmas Album,"I discovered the Herb Alpert Christmas Album just two years when my Christmas spirit was in decline. Ever since discovering its fun, kitschy sound I have been playing it from start to finish whenever I need a holiday boost. It's great soundtrack to have playing when your trimming the tree, cooking the holiday feast, or having friends over for cocktails. Throw it in your holiday playlist - it's a must play."
4,A Tijuana Christmas,"After hearing Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass' Christmas album for the first time in years, I admit it left me a little cold. My biggest complaint, a choir starts almost every song and Herb's singing on ""The Christmas Song"" isn't great; perhaps playing the trumpet instead of singing would have been better. Anyway, I hope I warm up to it next year when the holidays approach and the egg nog starts flowing. The good news is the re-mastered sound is very fine indeed and the cover is a classic. Some of the highlights were ""My Favorite Things,"" ""Jingle Bell Rock,"" ""Let it Snow"" and ""Winter Wonderland."" If you love Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass as well as Christmas music, you might want to check it out.Hey Herb, when are you putting out the great ""Volume Two"" album?"
3,Not what I thought it would be,"I guess I'm a TJB purest because all the ""Strings"" throughout the music turned me off. Lot's of ""OOO's and AAhhh's"" from background singers really nailed the lid on the coffin.Oh well."
3,Like Cool Whip Lite,"The guys that delighted with *Whipped Cream* are decimated to mere Cool Whip Lite for Christmas. There are periodic peaks of the familiar brass and verve in this compote, but a lot of empty fluff, too. It features frequent vocals from ""doo - doo"" folks (they sing a lot of o/~ doo o/~ o/~ doo o/~ o/~ doo o/~ with no Whop!) Reminds this reviewer of the elevator-friendly Fred Waring Singers.Unless you're a serious HATB fan, pass on this and go for the good stuff./TundraVision, Amazon Reviewr"
5,A Writer's Pen,"If you want to know how it feels to write with a pen that is the epitome of ""class""--then this pen is for you! Its weight is perfect; the line is smooth and even; and every word feels exquisite.I've never been so happy with a pen--and I'd wanted this very pen for the longest time. Best buy I've ever made!"
2,Overrated.,"After reading all the flowery reviews, I was determined to own a Montblanc pen. It has such a long and astonishing reputation, that I am now equivocal about writing something negative with regards to this pen.For $225 I don't see much of difference from this Montblanc from a Waterman for half the price. Nor do I see much difference from this Montblanc as compared to a good Cross pen. It's not a particularly weighty pen, nor does it feel like it glides over paper likepremier ice skater over ice.It feels rather ordinary rather than divine. I do not think I would purchase this pen again for this price tag. I'm glad I got one, but I don't think that I will own another in the near future.That's just my take on it and hopefully my review won't be torn to shredsby angry Montblanc enthusiasts."
5,Just great,"I've owned this pen for two years now, and has never failed on me. Writing is a pleasure and it's also a very beautiful pen. Featherlike, sober, resistant (I've dropped it several times and shines like new), and great service.Te best pen I've owned."
3,too much money for too little,"Sadly I have to say that this pen is overrated. I have a number of moderately priced pens ($50-$150) that are better constructed and feel better in the hand. Despite claims of ""precious resin"" the reality is that the pen is a black plastic pen with some gold plated trim. I don't see it being any more durable then any other pen. In fact, I would say that it is less durable than many of the moderately priced ones that I use. Cross makes great pens as does Waterman at a much lower price that write as well, if not better. When it comes to the Mont Blanc I think they have developed an image and that is what they are selling. $100 for image sounds about right, $300 makes me regret my purchase. I wish I could say something more positive, but this is the way I honestly feel."
3,Great product...poor service and shipping,"I NEVER received a response on the product (until it was a week overdue). I paid for expedited shipping (it took over 2 weeks) by USPS. I was happy with the product, but based upon customer service and shipping, EBay is a MUCH (!!!!!) more reliable option."
1,"they are selling fake pens, don't buy","I ordered ball point pen, but received a roller ball. It's a fake! Don't order from them."
1,Buyer Beward,"I placed an order with this company based on the belief that the product was in stock. However, 10 days after the order was placed I discovered that the item had not been shipped, because it was not in stock. The Montblanc pen that was suppose to arrive for my brother's 50th birthday will not be coming from this company because they canceled the order when I asked for compensation (a 10% discount) for the late delivery. As a half hearted gesture I was offered a $5.00 gift certificate for my next order with them. No chance of that ever happening."
1,Fake Pen,"The alleged Mont Blanc pen that I bought was a total fake. I bought it for my Dad's birthday, and I received it and everything seemed OK. He took it to the Mont Blanc store to get it engraved, and they identified the pen as a fake. They said it was an excellent fake, but fake nonetheless. Don't be fooled by this vendor."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PEN!,"I got this pen for my husband and now I am almost ashamed to give it to him!!! It looks and feels like an imitation, like a cheap pen. And it dodn't help the fact that it is sent in a VERY cheap box!!! You can buy any pen for $60 and will write the same or better.... BUT won't look cheap."
1,Shop elsewhere,"Non existent customer service, pen not weighted the same as my old Monte Blanc Classique - a little concerned at authenticity, but can't speak to seller - they don't reply.."
5,Best 80's Italian pop,"I purchased this CD from Amazon over 2 years ago and never regretted it. It embodies the pinnacle of joyful Italian pop of a few years back. Every song from the beginning to the end is a phenomenal success and leaves you wanting more. I must admit that once you listen to the whole CD a few times it will sound boring, just give it time and it will grow on you. Other musicians worth considering are: Albano & Romina Power, Collage, Ana Oxa & Pupo.5 stars"
5,Beautiful Italian Music,"This CD is very pleasant to listen to.Many years ago, I used to borrow the vynil record that has the same songs, from a public library.My memory of this music is so good, that I bought the CD when the vynil records disappeared.The music is rhythmic, melodic, inspiring.I'm proud and happy that I bought this CD."
2,Sooo misleading....,I thought the MOH400 was a cool way to show people how important I am (or at least make them think that). The description makes the device sound as a God send to add professional sounding recordings to your phone when you put people on hold. What they DIDN'T tell you was that your computer MUST be on 24x7 in order for everything to work correctly and that you MUST run the software continuously (or at least when you are on the phone and want to put someone on hold). Other than that it works like a charm. Just not at all what I expected....
5,One of the few books that has kept me in suspense,"This book kept me constantly asking ""what is going to happen next""? The movement from scene to scene keeps the reader interested but also is done in a way to prevent he or she from getting lost inside the book. You don't even need an incredible imagination to enjoy this reading, it basically creates the scene inside your head for you. And that is the beauty of this book! You won't want to put this book down, and chances are, you won't."
1,Does not work!,"I thought this product would be a great thing to use when my dogs were in thier crates. First of all, I don't know what water bottles it is suppose to be used with as none I have used will fit properly. I have tried all the major brands of water bottles as well as soda bottles and none screw in properly. I finally used plumbers tape to get a good seal. At first, they worked great. It attaches to the crate securely and by putting it just above the water bowl, it was easy to train to be used. Then they stopped using it. I finally discovered the ball valve rusted! Now I can get them to work for a day at most before I have to take them apart, scrub the ball valve and replace on crate. I got 3 of these things and by the time I figured out why my dogs quit using them, it was too late to return them. Great idea. Very dissapointed."
1,Ball Bearing RUSTED,"We had a crate waterer for our dog that was looped to the side of the crate, and our puppy kept knocking it off, so we thought this one would be perfect-- it latches on, can't be budged, adapts to any bottle. Unfortunately, it didn't work quite as well as we hoped.First, the bottles kept getting beat up (I think it was more our dog than the product itself), and so we kept having to replace them. It wasn't as seamless as advertised. Finally, we got frustrated with the bottles and removed it from the crate. Once I put the bottle up on the counter and looked at the spigot, I immediately realized why our dog hadn't been drinking from it. The ball bearing RUSTED. I left the bottle there for an afternoon, and we could quickly see the rust residue collecting in the bottom of the bottle.I don't know about YOU, but I wouldn't tolerate rust in my drinking water, or my dog's drinking water."
1,no good,"Didn't work well. Leaked all of the time. Not worth it. Very cheap, I guess you get what you pay for."
1,"Little ""business"" in this book","The word ""boring"" comes to mind when trying to describe this book. It is obvious that much of it is filler material with very little ""business"" oriented material. It's not necessary to know any level of details about specific products like ""4GL,"" etc. to explain the business view of what happened.This book is more a history of Informix than anything else. The ""Lessons Learned"" are very basic and could be covered in 1/4 the pages.There is nothing special at all in this book.My advice is to save your money and skip it."
5,Fantastic find at a great price,"My oh my, what a find. This fantastic single heralds a new band into the wonderful world of british music. A great find. The price I paid is way too much when I look at how much this one costs. Regrets. In any case, that's in that past, what can you look forward to with this cd? Great music is a start. The lead singer has a fantastic voice; he sounds a bit like Jeff Buckley, but he has a Nick Drake feel to him, at least I think so. The band perform marvelously, the music, it just grabs you and sticks in your mind for days on end. Listen to it and tell me you don't hum track 3 over and over at night. What else? Well, when Coldplay does hit it big here in North America, which will be soon, trust me, won't it be nice to show all your friends this massively rare CD? Listen, enjoy, it is worth your time and money."
5,"The ""Brothers & Sisters EP"" is Coldplay's hidden treasure th","""Brothers & Sisters + Good Television""Only now, has the U.S. received the sweet taste of a younger Coldplay circa 1999. You are probably wondering, ""How does this relate to the TV heading mentioned above?"" Well, in 2002, I bought the Roswell (Original Soundtrack)and Coldplay's ""Brothers & Sisters"" song was featured. After constantly replaying the song, I bought the EP. To my suprise, it was one of the best Ep's I have ever listened to.Here is how I rate the three songs:Brothers & Sisters: 9.8/10Easy to Please: 9.0/10Only Superstition: 8.0/10If you are interested in other great music, listen to the Roswell (Original Soundtrack, Garden State Soundtrack, and Travis."
4,Brothers and Sisters is an awesome song!,"Brothers and Sisters is one of my favorite coldpay songs, but the best album to get it on would be the ROSWELL tv show soundtrack! It's a great cd, including the wonderful song that is Brothers and Sisters!"
3,Brothers & Sisters Review,"Very nice album, the first ones of Coldplay.Nice and calm music...Very good for Coldplay fans..."
1,1 star for 1 incredible song,"Yes, they have one great song. I'm just getting kind of sick of them re-naming and re-releasing it like it's brand new."
1,Coldplay isn't worth buying. Why? They aren't unique.,"This ""early"" Coldplay EP (1999 was only about five years ago, people) matches what Coldplay is today: A boring slice of mediocrity... hold all the toppings, especially the meat that should be there but isn't. But wait! This Coldplay release has something the others don't; Chris Martin sounds suspiciously like Dave Gahan on these songs (when he isn't hitting those ball-grabbingly high notes, that is). My advice: Buy a Depeche Mode album. I suggest Violator, SoFaD, and Ultra for DM starters. Depeche Mode is everything you Coldplay listeners want, but with passion, adventurousness, and great hooks in EVERY song. Forget Coldplay and get some music that speaks to your soul instead of the money you have burning a hole in your wallet. We know all you Coldplay fans are rich snobs with nothing better to spend your undeserved cash on."
5,My impatience is cured,"As a fan of Coldplay's earlier music, this cd was the answer to my impatience while waiting for the release of their 3rd album. I was surprised that ""Brothers & Sisters"" was not included on one of their main cds because it's such a good song. ""Easy to Please"" is a soothing song that has a lot of background noises which help create the mood. The last song, ""Only Superstition"" is guitar heavy, but manages to stay true to Coldplay's style.This cd will not disappoint.*I recommend ""Brothers and Sisters"" from the Roswell soundtrack as it's an earlier version of the song."
1,Not good for deteriated pot metal coupler,"I had to extract the GM pot metal heater hose coupler after breaking it off when replacing the factory leaker with a steel one from Dorman. This tool just made the hole bigger until it was the size of the remover. The deteriorated pot metal coupler crumbled like a cookie. I had to drill out 11/16"" and then 1/2"" NPT tap the intake to clear the threads of the old material. Don't waste your time trying to remove all the material from the intake threads as you chance damaging them, let the tap do the work and save yourself hours of frustration!"
4,Very good CD/Receiver for the price,"This is a good player/receiver for the price. The one knob volume audio menu is great. The display is exceptionally easy to read. The FM broadcast reception is very good but the AM reception is weak. It is hard to criticize this player/receiver as it offers so many excellent features and truly outstanding performance for the price, but there are always one of two areas for improvement."
3,Brighter than the Krypton Sun,"As the other reviewer said, the auxillary input is not as loud as it could be which is annoying. Another annoying thing is that there is a blue light that burns holes retnas, its that bright. I have to put a towel over the headunit because its so distracting. If you painted the light a dull color it would get a better rating.the sound is of good quality as far as i can tell and it looks nice, It can play mp3 cds which is a plus and its relatively cheap. I would not buy this unit on my own accord because the light is so distracting."
4,"Buen sonido,","Tiene buena calidad aunque aun no la he probado por mucho tiempo. No le he conectado nada aun en el AUX-IN y francamente espero que soporte el calor que recibe el equipo dentro del auto, en buena parte del año.Yo solo necesitaba el Radio receptor pero es una buen equipo a simple vista. En el manual dice que tiene control remoto pero aparentemente ha sido error porque no iba nada, aunque es algo que para mi no es importante.Una cosa que yo no logré ver antes es que el espacio donde se introduce el equipo tiene menos longitud que el aparato, pero aparentemente es algo que se puede arreglar en un taller."
3,It was okay...,in a single simple word. my review would be ....meh... it was kinda campy at the end and very predictable. It was not the style of anime that I was hoping for. At least it was only a Dollar.
4,Fun ride,"Redline is a fun roller coaster ride. It doesn't have a deep plot or well-developed backgrounds for the characters, but it does have vulgarity, humor, and adrenaline-pumping animation. It's a good time. As a heads up, there's a scene where a female character is lounging in her apartment topless, but I don't think there is any other nudity."
5,fun to nwatch,great eye candy. good music. Kind of old school style. better to watch this stuff in blue-ray than dvd. go blue-ray
5,Redline fast fun,This movie is suberbly well animated and a blast to watch. I do wish it was a bit longer though. I kept wanting more backstory some came but not enough to satisfy me. Still quite a good movie!
5,redline,"this anime was fantastic see it a beautiful hd screen plasma or led me 50"" plasma it looks incredible dont miss it buy the bluray. i love stuff that push thelimits they did a amazing job. it was all hand drawn.awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"So-So Movie, but Not for Kids","It was only $.99 to rent, so I guess I got my money's worth. The graphics and overall plot were decent, but the movie was hard for me to finish. I guess some of the characters were a little over the top for me. Probably more enjoyable for a younger audience, but not kids due to language and adult content, which turned me off. It was not rated, but should be rated at least 'R""."
2,Deadline,Before I start this review I better point out that I am not a anime fan.Anyway Redline is a very mediocre movie. the voice acting isn't great and the story is kinda lame it felt to bare bones I felt like there was something I missed like this movie was a sequel to something which obviously meant piss poor character development. Don't get me wrong the characters had some cool designs but it was ruined by the bad character development. Even the animation isnt good its only cool during the turbo high speed scenes. All in all this movie felt kinda rushed. I say skip.
2,barely passable,"If you're an anime otaku and believe there is no such thing as bad anime you'll probably love this. It's got explosion, speed, cleavage, what more could you want.If you actually want a compelling story, something you remember a few days after you watch it, this isn't the movie for you"
1,I double-dog dare you to remove THIS review as well..,"So, Amazon is in the business of sales..and honest reviews of crappy items apparently inhibit sales..hence the title of this review.If you think ""Speed Racer"" was high art, then this movie is for you. If watching someone else play a video game is your idea of a great moviegoing experience, this flick has your name all over it.If you're into well written plots, dialog, or story..look elsewhere.If you think the emporer's new threads were AWESOME, buy this movie."
4,My thought of REDLINE,"It satisfied all of my expectations. It has custom vehicles, interesting characters, and a story that keeps you at the edge of your seat. I recommend REDLINE to anyone who loves anime as well as custom rides."
5,REDLINE,THAT WAS AMAZINGLY EPIC i loved it and so will you :) it had everything action drama sci-fi romance and a whole lot of EPIC hope you enjoy.
2,just ok,"This is one of three books that I purchased to do what I feel is the best thing for my twin baby girls...make their baby food at home with healthy (mostly organic) produce. Well, over all I was not impressed with this book. It states that formula fed babies do not need to be on a schedule. REALLY? Through my experience, I feel that ALL babies should be on a schedule. It is the best thing you can do to not only set up structure in the babies life, but in your own as well. Out of the three books, SPROUT RIGHT is my favorite. I bought it on Amazon. The author is a nutritionist, the info is great, and presented in an easy to use format."
4,Great Video Collection,The girl has still got it. I especially enjoyed the one with the little girl walking with the lion and the one they filmed in the dirty old hotel.So what if her voice is not strong...that's her sound. Keep on puttin em out Miss Jackson.
3,A Moderate Janet Fan's Perspective,"The dvd contains all of the videos that established her full blown sex appeal following ""Love Will Never Do Without You"" from the Rhythm Nation era. Here is Janet from ages 27-38. Janet clearly hasn't lost her beauty over the span of 11 years, but her video quality hasn't remained constant. The greatest moments on the dvd are the videos taken from the Janet and Velvet Rope projects. However, All Nite(Don't Stop) from her latest cd proves that Ms. Jackson still has it in her to make more innovative videos in the future.I wasn't impressed with the dvd extras. Why were there only extras pertaining to Damita Jo and not the other projects? It would have been nice to see a live performance of Janet performing ""Throb"" from SNL in 1994 or mabye her performances from Oprah in 1997.I suggest you buy this dvd only for the videos."
4,yay Janet,"This dvd would be really great for those who didnt buy the limited edition all for you cd/dvd combo... but for those who did... it's almost not worth it. The special features are Janet lip syncing to ""All Night"" and ""I Want You"" twice, making the ""All Night"" video, an interview about her new cd and the ryan seacrest interview(which is kinda cute). The only other gripe I have about the dvd is that on a couple songs the 5.1 surround mix is kinda crappy. Other than that it's a great dvd collection :)"
5,"Hey, they should have","used these videos for the ""AFY"" limited edition CD. This dvd rocks. After putting this dvd off for a year I finally decided to buy it. I'm glad I did, the sound on this dvd is way better than her other dvds and the videos look crisp and clear!Me being a hardcore Janet fan I'd have to say this is worth the purchase.I'm hearing sounds I've never heard before, drums, guitars, all sorts of stuff!Anyway, I can't wait for her new album in April!Holla!"
4,"Go, Miss Janet!","OK, I really thought this DVD was great but if you've got All For You (Limited Edition) don't but it because you're only missing out on 4 or 5 videos! Anyway, I bought this because I've seen not that much Janet music videos, my favourites are:All Nite (Don't Stop)Son of a GunAll For YouIfGo DeepTogether AgainEvery TimeThe reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because if you watch it a lot, it can get boring! And because they replaced the Just A Little While music video with a live performance. I enjoyed the special features, especially the Damita Jo interview, and thought that this was much better than Design of a Decade! Also, I really hated Together Again (Deeper Remix) it was too boring! Anyway, if you love Janet and don't have All For You (Limited Edition) buy it. But if you've just started liking Janet, I would advise you to listen to the albums first."
2,Janet Jackson -From Janet to Damita Jo: The Videos,I was quite sad as the DVD came scratched. The videos kept skipping. I need another copy. As the one I was sent was clearly damanged.
1,Janet in politics?,"Reading the review below, I understand we should all let us guide through democracy by the beautifull minds of Janet Jackson and Madonna. I always believed they were just icons of the undustrie of silly popsongs following the money. I was wrong. Dear Dietmar from the mean and cultural country of Germany, that brought us Modern Talking, has made me see the light. I shall never believe in people like Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandella again. Let Janet and Madonna take the world to a better place instead!"
4,Janet's popularity definitely lies in the VISUAL!,"One must admit that Jackson does not possess a strong voice; she is able to carry a tune and with her looks, that's about all that is necessary.This collection of videos, although touting all of the four titles of her last four albums, is rather limited in its offerings from the latest, ""Damita Jo."" That may be due to the fact that her most recent effort didn't spawn the sales success of the previous offerings.While a good segment of the videos presented here can be found on other compilations, they are still visual ""treats"" for the artist's many fans. They show her many different moods and physical changes over the past decade. Extras, like the ""live"" performance and the interview segment, serve their purposes, neither adding or detracting from the total package.It would've been a better choice to include the Blackstreet version of ""I Get Lonely"", though, because it is a far superior rendition than the solo Jackson effort."
3,Wonderful collection except a big flaw for me personally,"Janet Jackson is my favorite artist of all time and her videos are one of the biggest factors of that. however the version of ""If"" (my favorite janet video and song) is the original and not the all dance version which i live for. AND they omitted DOESN'T REALLY MATTER which is my other favorite and first janet song and video, i was upset with this product for that but it still doesnt stop me from enjoying the others. Janet Jackson is truly an amazing artist and i love owning a collection of her videos!"
3,Okay...not outstanding,"She's made some great videos, lets not forget. But if you want to know the definition of true music and videos, check out Michael Jackson."
5,Janet's the best!!!,"I love all the videos. My favorites are: If, I Get Lonely, All For You and All Nite (Don't Stop). The only video missing is Doesn't Really Matter. I don't know why this video was not included in this compilation."
3,EXCELLENT MOVIE. BAD DVD,"Maria Ford and others do a fine job in this excellent comedy/thriller. She is always a delight to see and this film gives her the opportunity to display her acting skills.The DVD has no features whatsoever though, not even scene selection. It's no better than a tape which you have to fast forward or reverse to get to a scene you want. Terrible;I have removed a star because of this"
4,U wouldn't expect this sort of quality on a handheld,"This game is one of the best for the Neo Pocket. If you like Sonic or platform games at all you have got to get this one. Like the Game Gear version for graphix but with tons more ways to play, a link up option, and tons more to it. This game has the longetivity factor in bucket loads. Complete all the courses with more rings to get puzzle pieces which give secrets, try to get the best times for each level, and if your lucky you can bully a mate into getting the game to play the great link up modes (I haven't tried these but from what I hear they are worth waiting for, luckily my girlfriend is getting her copy soon)."
4,Sonic The Hedgehog Pocket (Neo Geo Pocket),"Move over Gameboy, the Neo Geo Pocket is here. The NGP is a great system with games like Pocket Tennis, Metal Slug and the SNK fighters. It just got better with the new Sonic game out. Sonic plays just like it's Genesis counterparts. It has geat graphics-sharp and crisp, great gameplay and good sound. Any one who enjoyed Sonic on the Sega consoles will enjoy this.It has the classic one player mode, as well as the ability to replay any of the levels you have completed. It also has a puzzle mode where you collect puzzle pieces during the regular game which can be put together to form a complete puzzle. Finally it has a cool two player mode with the link up to see who can finish a level first. All in all a must have game for any NGP owner and definately a reason to buy the system if you haven't already. Great job Sega and SNK."
4,Sonic wins again!,This is a fantastic game on the NeoGeo. I am simply in love with this little critter. I can play a level over and over again and never get tired of maneuvering this lightening quick hedgehog. What fun!
4,System Seller,"Ten times better than Super Mario Bros. Deluxe, Sonic is finally back on a handheld and one that doesn't require 6 batteries for about 3 hours of gameplay. If you haven't yet discovered the true king of handhelds, the NGPC, do so with a copy of Sonic now! If you do have this Game boy beater, pick one of these up along with Dark Arms right away. These two games make the whole system worth it."
2,Better choice,"If you are really interested in this debate, a better choice would be the book ""Is The Jesus The God?"" by Douglas S. Rustad, which based upon his independent, self-consistent study of the Christian standard itself, the Greek New Testament, without the usual Christian doctrinal and blind-faith filters."
2,Too short and disappointing,This video is only 30 minutes...it seems like 5. It starts to make a point then moves on so quickly it is quite a dis-service to the Word and Life of Jesus. I am finding it hard to believe others gave this 5 stars...did we watch the same video? I buy often times on reviews ...I was bite on this one...hmmmm.
1,"I do not like the ""new"" Jewel...","I am not going to buy this CD; I used to enjoy her music, especially ""Pieces of you"" (which I LOVE!!) and ""This way"". Her lyrics were always amazing, you just have to listen to ""Standing still"", ""Who will save your soul"", ""Foolish games"", ""Pieces of you"", among others. My perception of Jewel changed when I heard ""Intuition"" from her latest album ""0304"", and after I saw the video on MTV. What is she thinking??? She is showing too much, she reminds me of Britney and Christina. The lyrics are too pop, not her stile. I HATE DE VIDEO; I HATE HOW SHE LOOKS IN IT!!! Especially hate the lyrics, although I have to admit her voice sounds the same, it seems to me like she just wants to be another singer with an album made just to SELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Jewel - separate yourself from the drum machine - please,"Jewel - separate yourself from the drum machine. Can you say Britney Spears or Christina etc. This CD by jewel actually makes the Avril Lavigne CD sound pretty good, at least she rocks. Jewel, darlin', get back to your roots of acoustic guitar ballads, piano and some other unique material like ""Daddy"" or ""Adrian"" type songs that defy classification. This CD is full of Britney drum machine music and basically sucks. Don't sell your gifted musical soul to the music industry. I know this isn't the music Jewel would write. Don't become a cash cow for the music industry, you're better then this. Long time Jewel fan. I won't buy this CD based on what I listened to here at Amazon, wasn't much but it was enough. Next step for Jewel would be to get a half dozen dancers and learn the Britney moves - then she could play karaoke as well. Very Sad."
1,Want A Combo? Jewel is the best!,"I was surprised when I first saw her new music video from this album. What a combo! Nowadays, Jewel is the combination of Britney, Christina, J.Lo...etc. Don't you think the world is full of pollution now? All muisc lovers, if you want a healthy ears, please don't listen to this album; if you want a healthy eyes, please don't watch her music videos or pictures, and don't buy her products for less pollution! Thank you!"
1,terrible...,"Jewel was one of the only artists that kept their respect in recent years and now she threw it all away to represent herself in some skanky personality which doesn't really seem different from Shakira... this seems to be for the sake of money and nothing else. and even if it is, it's just terrible music and look either way."
5,My FAV!,"I do miss the old Jewel as one reviewer pointed out(see A.'s review.), but I also loooove the new, redifined Jewel. Stand and Intuition are my favorites. I also like Sweet Temptation. Most of the songs are up-tempo, so they are good songs to dance to."
3,Not too bad...,"Okay, so it's not her best album, not by a long shot, but 0304 is actually pretty good. The use of 2 and U in the lyrics and titles kind of grates (I made the mistake of reading along the first time I listened. Don't, unless you have a high tolerance for aolspeak.)The songs themselves are a bit on the sappy side, some of them, but they're fun, bouncy, and mostly danceable. A few, like Sweet Temptation, have really interesting sounds.I'd recommend the album, but don't expect her best out of it."
3,"The Good, The Bad, and 0304","You don't have to like Jewel to like this album... in fact I think the exact opposite. Jewel's earlier albums definetly had more appeal in my opinion. I have to say that I loved ""Stand"" and although ""America"" was a shock at first, this song still has a good message. The problem is meaningful music no longer sells. and this album is designed to sell. If nothing else, you've got to give her credit for the sheer shock value here. In closing if you like pop music, go get it, 0304 is still better than most of the music I hear on the radio these days. If you like Jewel pick up any of her earlier work, you will be much happier with your purchase that way."
1,it's a pity,"I thought Jewel was one of the best artists around with her release of Spirit in 1998. Sadly, since then, it's been nothing but downhill. This is positively the worst album I've heard in quite a while. It's bad for pop music in general, and is even worse if you consider that it's JEWEL. Jewel, the lovely songbird from Alaska, is dancing around in her hooker clothes and chirping meaningless crap. It makes me sad to see such a wonderful artist fall like this."
3,"Good experimental album, but it's only good for a few songs","I like Jewel - don't get me wrong, but the two songs that sell the CD are Stand and Intuition. I like the techno twist to the CD, but it's inconsistent and makes the CD feel uneven to the listener. Good overall, but not great."
1,what is this?,"It's okay if artists want to change their sound sometimes, if they didn't they might get bored. But this album is awful. Notice how she never did pop again?"
2,ALMOST a middle of the road Album...,The album has some pretty catchy tunes but others not so.'Intuition' was the song that made me buy this and over all it still stands up as one of the best songs on the CD.'Stand' is a fun song that you just gotta bop your head to.'America' is a good song but her political views are that of a leftist quack. As a very 'middle of the road' person it's obvious that this is a good song that contains the message of an idiot.'Run 2 U' is like old Jewel music with a dance beat. Very odd and just doesn't sound right. (Least favorite of the lot.)Over all the rest of the songs are just kinda there.The songs 'Intuition' and 'Stand' are the only song I really listen to. I would listen to 'America' also if the lyrics made any sense and were not so radical. (Sad that this song was ruined by a message like this.)2 out of 5 stars...
4,I Like It,"Oh puhleeeze to all you who like the folksy Jewel, get off your high horses. I didn't really like Jewel until her newer songs such as ""Standing Still"" and ""Intuition"". If that's called selling out than I guess I don't know ""real"" music. All I know is I like the songs and they're upbeat and fun without getting too serious and folksy. If all Jewel's trying to do is make music and sell CD's than as far as I'm concerned it's working. It's the first Jewel CD I've bought."
2,Britney? Christina? No! It's Jewel...,"Everyone knows how Jewel used to sound so I'm not going to get into that. Reagrdless of her past albums, this albums is just not good! The only reason this album gets 2 stars is for ""Haunted"" which may be Jewel's best song yet. (This is a hidden gem on this album).This reminds me of the teen pop crowd like Britney and Christina. I fear Jewel will soon be touring with Aaron Carter. The lyrics are pretty good, but there's just too much fluff and cheesy production for me to take this as a serious album.This album will surely open up more people to Jewel, but it undoubtedly turn alot of current fans off. Most of this album is very poppy with dance beats galore, so if you like that sort of thing, pick up this album. If not, stay away, even if you are a diehard Jewel fan."
2,Hmmmm...,"I've never been a huge fan of Jewel in the first place (although I do like her first couple of albums) so I may be a bit more objective about this. On the whole this isn't as bad a sell out as, say, Metallica, but it's not the bold stylistic move of Bob Dylan either. With this she tries to blend her intelligent lyrics with a modern dance sound and production values. Sadly, with the exceptions of a couple tracks (""Stand"" and ""America""), it just doesn't seem to come off the ground well. It comes off like an attempt to jump on the teen pop bandwagon. Mostly the music is the usual non-descript generic dance pop that's been on the radio for the past few years now. More than anything, this is a ""Producer's Album"" rather than an artists creation. Stick with ""Pieces Of Me"" and ""Spirit""... Ok maybe not so objective."
5,Bryant's Review,"I have been a Jewel fan since 6 years old. And i have 2 say this is nothing too different from previous works. Look at songs Like the Jupiter Remix. It would fit perfectly on this album... or the Break me Remix... Jewel style and sound has only changed not her lyrics or the way she does stuff. Jewel is not a sellout. No one calls Tori Amos a sellout... yet she changed her style drastically for every album... Look at the album ""This Way""! How diverse was it... ppl can't take hints can they?""Standing Still"" is a country song""Break me"" is a rock ballad""This Way"" is more up tempoAnd ""Serve the Ego"" is a dance song0304 has all these elements! Buy it... this album is a combo of everything and is good!"
2,......,I don't think Jewel is a sell out. Her songs are still moving and just as poetic as her other cds but I feel that the new pop/dance music drowns out her unique voice. I don't think the music fits with the lyrics.
3,Expanding her horizons..,"When I first heard Jewel's single, ""Intuition"" I could not believe it was her and was even more surprised and a bit dissapointed when I saw the video. She had become a regular Britney clone doing flashy dance steps in ever-so flashy outfits. I refused to buy the CD but as a Jewel fan I knew I was obliged to give her a chance. The results were surprising. I never liked pop but Jewel has a way with words, yet this album to me is definitly at the bottom of her albums. I do believe Jewel is staying true to herself with her lyrics and the original mezmorizing voice we all fell in love with but her image is completely different. Some may say she is selling herself out in order to sell more but I believe it is not the case. Jewel is still herself behind all the sheer clothings and pop sheen melodies but she is trying to prove herself as a true artist with this album than as a joke which most people see her as now. I still hope she goes back to her tree hugging days :)"
5,Don't Judge A CD By The Cover,"Sure, Jewel has the basic Diva outfit on the cover, but what does that have to do with her artistic ferver. This CD is better than anything else Jewel has done in my opinion. Pieces of You...Boring Shlock with 2 good songs. Spirit...Better with a Patrick Leonard makeover...This Way...Good but not amazing. 0304, is the best in her metamorphisis. Stand grabs you from jump, and the satirical video for Intuition might have hurt Jewel a little bit, but no one knows that. I think that I saw the change as something positive, but others aren't that open. There are some rock songs here that remind me of Madonna in the 80's and some that remind me of the songs from This Way. The change however is welcome in my opinion and I hope that she continues on this path."
5,Jewel's Best,"I've been holding off on buying Jewel's new cd, but after hearing Stand I had to go buy it. This is by far Jewel's best album. It's quite a bit more upbeat then her previous works. Check out the song entitled ""America"". Awesome lyrics! I highly recommend this cd."
1,Completely Disappointed,"As we enter the pop era many artists change, some that you'd never expect to. This is what happened to Jewel. If you loved her first albums then this is DEFINETLY not the CD for you. It is very popish and very different from her earlier work. If Britney Spears is your idol I reccomend this CD. If you liked her earlier work then you might wanna try Sarah McLachlan's new CD, afterglow."
3,Jewel's new album,"at first i was quite intrigued by her album (which i got as a present) after hearing her first single, intuition. it had a boppy tune and was catchy at the same time. i took a listen of all the songs, and it was one of those albums which u listened to only a few seconds of one song and skipped to the next...the only songs i would say that caught me to listen over and over again would be 'stand'-becos the lyrics were meaningful, 'intuition' - if ure up for some dancing, and '2 find u' which was sweet. i wouldnt say its a crap album but im sure there would be much better out there."
2,Just like the others,Jewel probably thought by injecting her voice and her body into a style of pop now the mainstream in popularity today she'd get more coverage or sell more CD's...all she's done is failed because there's nothing particularly original or spectacular here and she would have sold more CD's by being herself in the long run.
3,The curse of a label,"I'm another long time fan of Jewel. Just heard the album twice and came round here to scout the reviews. My thoughts firstly: It is good album. Secondly: This is a very different Jewel sound as compared to before. The lyrics are still as sharp but the music is well, pop. Like it or leave it. What saddens me actually is reading about people questioning Jewel for losing her originality or selling out. It is terribly ironic because perhaps the bravest thing Jewel did was to do a sell out pop album. She could very well have churned out a folk album after another but she chose not to. It could be a misguided move but isn't that the definition of being daring? When did pop become such a dirty word?"
5,THIS IS A FUN DANCE RECORD!!!,"Jewel has created a masterpiece. this is the most fun i have had listening to a record in years. this is an instant classic for me. this is already one of my 10 faveorite albums of all time. this album was meant to be fun. my faves are ""u & me = love"" and ""yes u can"". played back to back they liven up any dance floor or party. the surprise is fragile heart. a great ballad. it sounds so sweet. there is not a bad song on here. don't be negative. crank up 0304 and get down and get groovy!"
3,"Hey, experimentation is a good thing.","Honestly, I haven't heard too much of Jewel's work, so I don't know whether or not I'm qualified to review this album. Although it may not be in the same vein as my other personal favorites, I loved ""Intuition"" when I saw the video on TV. I didn't realize Jewel had put out a new album, so I came online to check it out.One thing I'm baffled about: Why do the ""old Jewel fans"" have such a problem with a musician giving another genre a shot?I think ""Intuition"" is a well-written song. It's rhythmically and melodically interesting to me. If it's not your bag, no big deal. But don't bash the musician for experimenting. Most great artists are well known for only ONE of their styles (ex: Picasso's abstract paintings), even though their other work shows just as much talent. Just because Jewel was once known for her folksy sound doesn't mean she can't show talent in other areas as well."
5,"A new, different Jewel","I knew the first time I heard ""Intuition"" Jewel's sound had definately changed from the solo-accoustic sound to a more mainstream pop sound. I love it. I also figured that all of you out there who love the accoustic sound Jewel portrays would hate this new mainstream sound. It is different, but it's not bad! You have to give the woman credit for trying something different. Also, in the pop sound of today different instruments are being incorperated to make a broad sound, something that is new to pop. I enjoy the new sound."
1,Only one good song...,"There is only one good song on this C.D.! Don't get it, it is a waste of money."
4,A Jewel of A CD!,"Wow! I got this Cd a little skeptical about Jewel's new sound. I loved the first single ""Intuition""-and i liked the new look for Jewel. So i bought the CD-and I wasnt dissapointed!!**Favorite Songs**StandIntuition2 Find UFragile HeartHauntedAmericaOther than that-nothings overly good or bad."
1,well i dont know,"well since cdnow doesnt even have examples available on the day it comes out, i am not able to hear it before i buy it."
1,Wow...,I could launch a T.V. series on how this album fails. But I won't. I will simply say that I wish she would go back to folk.
2,garbage,"this cd is PURE garbage. stand was an ok song, so i thought i'd download the album, even though i hate Intuition. there are only about 3 or 4 cuts that are GOOD on this album. the rest sounds like the latest britney spears album!! URGH! i can't believe it!! WHY JEWEL WHY. even the songs that sound like her older stuff, her voice still sounds more computerish. maybe her next album will be better"
2,"Sometimes, it's all about selling - even yourself","It is what every real Jewel fan would write: It's not her, why care about this CD?So, yes, I did listen to it, about two days. It got boring as soon as most Popsongs do, it doesn't inspire you with its lyrics as her first albums did.She was outstanding, because she had her own way and she had success with it. But it was obviously to hard or not working good enough. Whatever it was, Jewel changed and for me, not for the better. I miss her a little and if you do too:Try Sarah McLachlan. She's true to herself and to her music. She's not selling herself for a little plastic fame."
5,Great pop album,"Yes I know there was controversy with this album. Jewel's original fans think she ""sold out"" by doing a pop album. I say good for her.No offense but PIECES OF YOU was a horrible album. I bought it in one of those 12 CDs for a penny deal because of ""Who Will Save Your Soul?"" But I have never listened to the album again.0304 is a smartly written well performed album that is miles ahead of anything Britney Spears has ever done."
2,NEWS FOR ORIGINAL JEWEL FANS!!,"HEY! for all you that's pretty much given up hope on our lil Jewel Kilcher (like i did) GUESS WHAT?! i just saw an interview w/ her and she said her next album is gonna be ""lo-fi"" and not like this one!! SHES GOIN' BACK TO HER ORIGINAL ACOUSTICNESS!! (...is that a word???) n e wayz, YA! good job jewel, this wasn't ur style anyways. SO YA! dont give up on hope yet, because our original GOOD jewel is back.although this cd DID have some original cuts... ""To Find You"" sounded like it coulda come from the ""This Way"" sessions. other than that, nothin' stands out...so at least there was SOMETHING half descent on this album. To Find You coulda been on this way, if she changed some things. anyways.CONGRADULATIONS JEWEL!! Your Originalness is gonna be back with us next year ^__________^"
1,Why did Jewel sell-out?,"All of Jewel's past albums have been commercially successful and she's formed an enormous fan base over the years, so why sell-out now and make pop-crap for the masses of teeny-boppers who think Shakira or Justin Timberlake are tallented? It's as though it's a joke...just an entire album's worth of a joke, but I'm sure this was what the record company told her to do, because they wanted to sell a few more records and give Clearchannel something to play on all of their stations across the US all summer. I hope no other great artists fall as Jewel seems to have."
1,DISGUSTING,all i have to say is jewel is a complete sell out. this album is complete pure POP. which as we all know is a very different path than her normal music. it's disgusting how she has sold out just to make money. all her old fans will be supremely disappointed. yet unfortunately she'll gain some new ones.......... the 12 year old teeny boppers
3,"Unless you are a big Jewel fan, don't buy the CD....","I bought this CD because I love the song ""Intuition""....unfortunately, it is the only decent song on the CD. (Had I known this, I would have purchased the single instead!) The whole disk is pretty much teeny-bopper pop 'music'.....if that's what you like, then this is the cd for you!"
3,"interesting change, but bland","I usually like it when my favorite artists try new things, but sometimes they move into the wrong direction. Jewel is an example of that. I've been a fan since her first album, which is my favorite. I was really pleased that her last CD had more of a rock sound to it because she sounds fantastic doing rock. I was hoping she'd do more of that, but instead she's made a very pop CD, which doesn't suit her very well. If you're expecting the old Jewel on this album, you'll be disappointed. Expect something more like Kylie Minogue dance songs, and you'll be better prepared for the shock. ;) This CD also seems to be lacking some of the more poetic lyrics that Jewel usually writes. Overall, it'll be something I'll listen to when I'm in the mood for pop, but it lacks a certain something that would separate it from the rest of the bland music that's on the radio."
5,"Snappy, Poppy and Upbeat","I heard ""Intuition"" first and I was suprised that it was Jewel! And when I saw the video, my jaw dropped and I was thinking ""Is that really Jewel?!"" But I really like her new sound and new look. It strikes me as very 80's, twist of retro but cool and refreshing, but still retains the essence of Jewel. I like her new album. I've listened to it over and over again and enjoyed it thoroughly!"
4,Jewel has fun,"Jewel's surprisingly Britney-like 0304 record is hardly breaking any new ground musically, but it does provide the uber-sensitive singer/songwriter some room to grow and have some fun. Opening track and second single ""Stand"" is an interesting blend of Middle Eastern/Latin rhythms and intelligent lyrical phrasings telling of how society has gotten to be drab and askew in recent years. ""Intuition,"" her first Top 10 from 0304, is driven by a French accordian and some impressive drum programming. The remaining tuneage sounds about the same, but ""Intuition"" and ""Stand"" are definitely the sound-off and standout singles. Saying that Jewel's 2003 record is in by any means ""selling out"" the former folky Alaskan is unfair. Like her song: ""Everybody needs someone sometimes,"" and this could be her someone."
2,Jewel as Succumbed,Like many female artists these days Jewel has gone for Britney image of dressing like a tart and flashing her assets to sell albums.
2,can be barely called 'an experiment...',"What Jewel refers to as ""organic beats such as hand-clapping"" are actually middle-eastern foundation beats that you will find in almost any middle-eastern pop song and even some mediterranean songs. I think this musical attempt stands out there without a soul due to the fact that Jewel neither readily admits nor understands these middle-eastern influences and thus fails to integrate that into her music rather than simply replicating it. while it's nice to see Jewel taking a new direction, the songs on this album lack originality in sound and arrangements. And it's not just the hand-clapping, but the arrangements of the semi-orchestra in songs like ""Intuition"" sound eastern mediterranean and middle-eastern, too. When I first heard ""Intuition,"" I thought I was listening to the English version of a Turkish song... or Arabic... or possibly Greek... but not ""organic"" as Jewels dismisses it."
5,"Jewel, you go girl!","I've been a huge fan of Jewel since I discovered her and heard her album ""You Were Meant for Me/Foolish Games"". And after seeing her new music video for ""Intuition"" on MTV, I was really impressed with Jewel's new style of pop music, and I was eager to buy her new CD. I finally bought it. When I listend to it, I loved it! Jewel's new style of pop was awesome! Why do some people hate her just because she want's to try something new? She is NOT trying to be Britney. Jewel is still Jewel with her beautiful lyrics, and music, but with a different and cool light pop/rock beat.~~~~~~~~~~Stand ~ 5 starsRun 2 U ~ 5 starsIntuition ~ 5 starsLeave the Lights On ~ 5 stars2 Find U ~ 5 starsFragile Heart ~ 5 starsDoin' Fine ~ 5 stars2 Become 1 ~ 5 starsHaunted ~ 4 starsSweet Temptation ~ 5 starsYes U Can ~ 5 starsU+Me=Love ~ 5 starsAmerica ~ 5 starsBecoming ~ 5 stars~~~~~~~~~~Grade: A++++~~~~~I recommend this album to all Jewel fans.

3,Heard It Once and Gave It to My Neices,Jewel's vocals should always be skipping across the top of the music. This CD requires you to wade through the dance and hip-hop noises that are drowning out Jewel's gift. Occasionally you get a good clean Jewel vocal that is not struggling to emerge from the confusion of this over produced CD. When I bought this CD I was fantasizing that Jewel would be crying in my ear with her guitar. Just she and I alone. Instead I ended up in a noisey discotech and couldn't wait to leave.
1,Jewel is officially a SELLOUT,"This CD is HORRIBLE. It is, by far, the worst CD I have ever purchased. I used to respect Jewel for her earlier works which seperated her from the rest of the cookie cutter pop princesses. Now shes desperately trying to cater to a whole new croud with poppy britney-spears-like songs through the use of her new-founded, blatent sexuality. The only catchy song on this CD is ""Intuition"" and it gets old quickly. Sure, for those who have seen the ""Intuition"" music video, Jewel is making fun of capitalism and advertising agencies who use sex and fame to sell products. But how does she explain turning around and selling that very song to Gillette to promote their new shaving product for women??? Now all we see of Jewel is a 40-year-old women clathed in mini skirts and barely-there bra tops trying to stake a claim in a Britney Spears' market. This CD is horrible. I ALMOST can't blame her for using sex to sell this one."
1,Jewel is a sell-out!,"I love all the albums preceding 0304. However, her new style is disappointing. Save the pop for Brittany, Jewel. I'm trading this one in at my local record store."
1,What a waste,"This CD is trash. Mindless pop. What's the point of it? There's no reason for it to exist. I never gave Jewel's music much attention before until this past summer when I saw 'Intuition' come on the TV. I had to do a double take. ""Thats Jewel?"" I thought. This album actually made me go out and buy 'Pieces of You' to see what was so impressive about her eariler work. I was definately blown away. I understand an artist's longing to want to expand out, but this is ridiculous. The fact that her last album didn't sell so well should tell you that this is a sellout album, not musical expansion. What once was ""who will save you soul/after all those lies that you told, boy"" is now ""follow your heart baby!"" sung over forgetful, sugary dance-pop beats. She really was a breath of fresh air in the music industry. Now she's just like any other forgettable pop artist."
2,Folk Music Meets Canned Sound,"Sounds like teen-spirit...J-Lo, Kylie, Spice Girls,etc, etc.Sad, sad, sad.The voice is still lovely and the lyrics are intelligent, but that alone is not toe-tapping for me. If witty lyrics were my only interest, I would skip the CD and buy poetry, the music is...well...boring. The originality of Jewel's earlier magic is outtahere.As a fan and a fellow human being, I think it is too harsh to say Jewel has sold out, perhaps she is trying something new to be brave. Good for you. However, I hope this new creative step is not what I can expect from future albums."
2,"ok ,but I give Her credit for trying something","I've never been that Big on Jewel&sure didn't think She would ever try anything different so I was surprised when I Heard Her lead single off this set.Vocally She is still the same.I See She is Pulling a Leann Rhimes in that She is trying for that Pop Cross-Over Appeal after being on the scene for a good while now.but the Music here&vibe feels like it passed Her by.Her trying to do what Celine Dion is doing now with a Brittney or CHristina type of Sound&Vibe just ain't happening but I give Her Prop points for taking a chance.but, Usher style Album titles just ain't in the cards nor the Sound for Jewel in the Long haul."
2,Quality matters,"well, I don't really care if she made a total pop album as long as the quality of this album is great although a lot of people do not like this album just because it does not have folk songs/lyrics that she used to make. However, the sad thing is that she ended up making a very crappy pop album and most of the songs sound like fake Europe-Beat. Songs are boring and cheap sond effecs are jus anoying. The only song I kinda like is Haunted (track#9)."
2,Why?,"I've only recently started getting into jewel's music..her old stuff was amazing, and I was really looking forward to this cd. lo and behold, you can tell how freaking shocked and confused i was when i listened to some of the tracks on this coaster. i can only ask myself why such a talented and stand-above-the-crowd musician would decide do this. at first, after listening to her single intuition, i tried to convince myself that she was going to be making some kind of clever statement with this album. now i understand that most of this cd is just manufactured pop. it's really sad to see another star being used and abused, as jewel would say, by a record label...well that's how it appears to me anyway. she should go independent, like the band collective soul has done recently. she might lose some exposure by doing so, but it'd sure as hell prevent her from being forced to release something like this again."
4,A brave new step,"""Leave the Lights On,"" ""Intuition,"" and ""Haunted""; some of her best work to date. She has improved much musically since ""This Way,"" though lyrically she still needs to do some work. I know she's trying to be ironic on some of the songs (she even says so on ""Stand"") but it just sounds silly.Once you get over some of the lyrics, and the new sound, it's a great listen.Next, I want her to make a whole album along the lines of ""Haunted."" It's that good."
1,Who Will Save Her Soul? I wonder...,"Do I have to give it any stars at all? If she'd started off like Britney Spears, nobody would have minded so much. But she promised something different, assured her fans that she was something new and unique, and then she goes and sells out...this is far too much of a sidestep for jewel, and I don't think her current fans will appreciate it. Walk toward the light, Jewel. Walk toward the light!"
1,This isn't even good pop!!,"I loved ""Intuition"" when I heard it, and I'm not a big Jewel fan! So, I was hoping for a welcome change from her normal folk music when I downloaded this. Hate to say this, but this isn't really pop. It's mostly folk with a rock edge. Think Michelle Branch here with some Natalie Merchant and modern Madonna influences. Really, ""Intuition"" is as pop as it gets and to me, it's really the only good song on this album!"
3,commercial success likely,Jewel's new album set to dance rhythm is disappointing to me. The writing is wonderful as always. The songs tend to sound alike after a while. Of course I prefer the folk style and would like some like this thrown in but not a whole album of it.I gave it to my 10 year old niece who loves it.
1,Selllllllll Outtttttt,"What happened to the Jewel that played her own instruments and brought out a soft country in her pop? She has transformed into a perfect-bodied wannabe with the most rediculus music! With U's intead of You's, 2's instead of two's or to's or too's, B's instead of be's... holy crap! I don't no about u, but th@ re-le pisses me off."
1,Jewel Kilcher Sells Out For The Almightly Dollar,"Although I was never a big fan of Jewel, I was suprised that Jewel, of all people, would sell herself out to commericalism. I never thought I would see the day that Jewel would turn herself into a Britney Spears knockoff just to get airplay on top 40 radio. What's next? Torn (Remix) by Natalie Imbruglia feat. 50 Cent?This album is worth borrowing from a friend. Not because of the talent, but so you can understand what commericalism can do to a once talented artist. The album is interesting only the way a car wreck is interesting. 0304 is the kind of album I'd expect from a debut artist, not someone like Jewel. 0304 is what happens when artists listen to executives in the boardroom instead of their fans."
1,"not a ""jewel""","I was surprised when i heard this playing in the background of a record store. I could not believe that it was Jewel. I am glad i heard it first, otherwise it would have been waste of my time and money to buy this album. I liked her early music, she had a unique voice and musical style. She appears to have abandoned her strengths. I will have to think twice when her next album comes out."
3,llarochelle,i think this cd is good i will always like jewel she didnt really change her music style that much i think it is really her personal style. Jewel rock on i think you look great and youre cd is great.
5,"New Sound, Same Outstanding Lyrics","Admittedly, as a Jewel fan, I was a bit apprehensive about this new ""sound"" Jewel had. Would it suit? Or would her folk rock prove to be better? All fears were eased when I put the cd in my cd player and listened to every track from start to finish.0304 is Jewel branching out with a definite new sound. But the true heart of Jewel is still there, evident in her lyrics. All new pop, r&b;, and occasional dance beats carry her lyrics all the right ways.The disc's first single, Intuition, is a great satirical view of today's entertainment industry. Standout songs for me are Run 2 U (Very reminiscent of Jewel's pre-0304 work with the updated sound), 2 Find U, Fragile Heart, Doin' Fine (Personal favorite), 2 Become 1 (Way better than that Spice Girlsl song of the same name), Yes U Can, and U + Me = Love. There's also America which like Intuition seems to satire.It's safe to say, from my standing, that whatever Jewel decides to do, it's going to be good. 0304 is evidence."
2,What happened Jewel!?,Honestly this album is really disappointing. I will say to you just go back to Alaska and explore your roots again! Take care!
1,I want my money back,"I absolutely hate this cd. I prefer the old Jewel with her insightful lyrics. I've tried several times to get through this cd and every time I feel she has sold out. I have nothing against expanding your horizons and trying new things, but leave the bass heavy pop music to Britney. Ugh."
1,THIS CD STINKS!!!!!!!,I DON'T KNOW WHY PEOPLE BOUGHT THIS CD BUT I WOULD NEVER BUY IT JEWEL USED TO BE MUCH BETTER BUT NOW SHE STINKS PEOPLE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS..................
1,This...WHAT IS THIS?,"Hey, whatever happened to the Jewel Kilcher that played the acousic guitar, and had a beautiful voice? But this? This is a nightmare. All I can say is, what a waste of talent. As a previous reviewer wrote, THIS IS NOT THE JEWEL WE KNOW! >:(Was she trying to impress pop lovers? Well, I like pop, but she certainly didn't impress me. Now, she's just a sick clone of Britney, who wears trashy clothing, and who seems to use internet chatspeak in the titles of her songs...I really hope she goes back to country.Jewel, PLEASE come back...:("
1,WHERE IS JEWEL?,"Oh, Jewel (or is it Juel?), what happened? Desperate much? Has Shakira sued you yet for ""Intuition?"" It's not you. You're not you. You were hot when you weren't trying so hard to be. I'm not buying the ""irony"" thing either. I say flaunt what you've got but don't pretend it's to prove some point about the exploitation of overt sexuality and not merely to sell more of your own records using the same tactic. This album is proof that Jewel's career has lasted at least one album too many. ""This Way"" wasn't really necessary either. I'm not even going to address the whole issue of the book of ""poetry"" or her ""acting"" career. Please retire, Juel. Please."
2,Very slick pop...,Very slick pop album. One notable exception is a great song about a stalker called Haunted. This song is a keeper. It's nice to finally have a CD burner.
2,Jewel can shine better!,"A poet. A singer. A thinker. Now creating pop-songs??? Seems like she is crossing over! This is so unlike her previous albums, it took me by surprise! Her albums especially ""Pieces of you"" really come out well for her thoughts, poems as much as for her singing style - this one is definitely not in that class. However, i must add Fragile Heart was touching and also had a catchy rhythm to it. But the rest of the album is not Jewel.Still, its on top of my listening CDs rack. For now."
1,Soul is not present,"If you're a fan of raw music, that is, the very soul singing out to you, then forget it. Jewel turned. She's no longer beautiful. She's glitzy, glamorous, shallow, and mainstream. ""Pieces of You"" is beautiful. ""Spirit"" started tapping ever so slightly into mainstream, adding more guitars and drums into the songs. ""This Way"" was about halfway there. Now ""0304"" is completely there. Even her voice has gone shallow. No emotion floats on this CD. No melodramatic lyrics as the beats and technology overrun them.Some people will like this CD as it_IS_""refreshing"" from Jewel. However, she's now a radio clone. Too bad...I think she's losing legions of fans."
1,Disappointed,"I was so disappointed to see Jewel in this manner. This is not the honest, beautiful, talented, speak to your soul, singer and brilliant songwriter that I love. This is a teeny bopper sellout. Unfortunatly B. Speers has more tallent than this CD has. I believe she will lose so many of her devoted fans if she continues on like this....and the new fans that she may attract because of the teeny bopper pop sound will never understand or appreciate the true Jewel. I'm so sorry that she felt the need to cave into the pressure to sell albums.....the one thing she did sell is her soul.....I can't believe she sold out. :("
1,Who is this?,"Where did Jewel go? This isn't her. Sounds more like Madonna in the 80's but this is 2004! No wonder I hadn't heard of this CD until browsing Amazon. I just hope Jewel comes back as herself sometime soon. Yuck, Yuck, Yuck!"
3,Same Jewel just having a lot more fun,"I am a huge Jewel fan and I was intrigued by her single ""Intuition"". I was pleasantly surpised by the album. I commend her for changing her direction and having a little fun. The lyrics are still introspective and she has a few gems on the album, Haunted, Intuition, Becoming, America. I am glad that she changed direction for this album, I always knew there was more to Jewel lurking beneath the surface and this album really shows that."
3,Not her best but kinda catchy for my young kids,"I am not crazy about the CD (I loved her first two though!) however, my two and four year old love it and dance around the house when I play it so I am giving it three stars instead of one or two. I am kinda wondering if she released this as a joke. It kind of seems like she 'cashed in and sold out' like one of her says. So was it a joke Jewel?"
3,"Different, But Still Good","Jewel has gotten a lot of flack for changing her style, but don't listen to what other people say. Jewel makes her music exciting by trying out new sounds instead of making the same record over and over again. If you listen to the lyrics on this record Jewel still has the same values and opinions - she just put a different beat behind it this time. Give the girl a little credit for putting herself out there. Highlights include: ""Stand"" (best song in my personal opinion), ""Intuition,"" ""2 Become 1"" and ""Haunted."""
1,"I love Jewel, but I dislike this album","I'm big Jewel fan really dont get me wrong! But I hate dance music and this album did not hit a single note with me at all. when I went out and bought it, I got home and put it on and isten to it all the way thought I put down and I have not listen to it at all since that day. The rest of her cd's I still love. I hope she goes back to her old style on her next album."
1,hold me back....,"dont get mad at me because of the rating i put on... i heard ""Intuition"" and i really didn't care for it...is Jewel starting to fade?? I have most of her previous albums, and i love them lots! she is very talented...but just at looking at the cover of 0304, i thought ""oh no, is jewel getting that damn contagious nauziating britney spears thing""?? please someone tell me if this is worth getting...is it like her previous stuff?? or is she turning into bubblegum pop? thanx"
1,"Why Jewel, Why?????","Some change is good. I loved the folky style of Pieces of You and Spirit... she changed to a (slightly) harder rock style in This Way, and I think she pulled that off pretty well. I loved all three of those albums.But this album... it's HORRIBLE... she LOOKS AND SOUNDS like a Brittney Spears/Christina Aguilera wannabe!!! I don't mind change, but when change is to sound like EVERYONE ELSE... particularly when the EVERYONE ELSE at the time is CRAPPY... is awful. I couldn't believe Jewel would do this and it let me down. Horrible, Horrible, horrible... that's all I can say"
1,what the..?!!!,"i don't know what's going through jewel's mind now.. i mean i am a big (or maybe was) fan of her music, but now i'm just so terribly disappointed. i wanted to give it a half a star but i guess it wasn't possible.. so so very disappointed."
1,I'm literally wrinkling my nose,"I've never been more disappointed in an album. The lyrics are absolutely trite and hollow, the synth-beats are overwhelming, and this is just NOT Jewel at all. I mean, sure, an artist is allowed to re-invent themselves, but they must also re-invent themselves to create something that is actually GOOD. This album is not. Buy this if you're a pop fan, not a Jewel fan."
1,"Where did Jewel go, and will she be back?","This album is nothing short of a pop laden, sadness parade. I remember the days when Jewel was an artist deserving of respect. Now she looks more like a thirty year old Spears wanna-be. What a sad desension for such a talent. Lets hope some day Jewel will rediscover the joys of Folk and return again to her former glory. In the mean time at least we still have the Greats (Townes VanZandt, Gillian Welch, Linda Thompson, The Jayhawks, John Gorka, Joni Mitchel, Tom Paxton, Phil Oches, Nick Drake ect.) Long live Folk."
1,Bizarre and Doesn't Gel,"This CD has such a different sound that when It was presented to me, I thought it was a joke. After weeks, I'm realizing it is no joke, but in fact there is something definately wrong in Jewel-land.Hopefully in a few years it will surfact that the record company pressured her into this ""niche"" market, and that she needed to pull more revenues by marketing to a younger generation that is willing to spend more money on CD's and merchandising.If you like Jewel's past albums, you will not like 0304. If you listen to dance music on the radio and like acts like boy band and pop-diva's, this album is for you.I lay in the former, and am thoroughly dissaopointed with this unoriginal and typical pop cd."
2,Jewel fan disappointed,I have to say that I was a bit disappointed with Jewel's new cd. I reamained optimistic even after seeing the cheesey titles using numbers and letters which seemed to totally degrade Jewel's intelligence and artistic creativity. After getting the album I was disappointed at Jewel's change. With the morph into the pop world I believe Jewel has lost something that made her music stand apart from all the others.
2,What the...,"Jewel, Jewel, Jewel.. what happened?! This is just like all the other pop out there! She used to be great, now she sounds like a teeny bopper, with the song titles to match. I mean really Run 2 U and U & Me = Love? What is with the lame titles? It's to techno, it's not the acoustic Jewel that was the best music. I miss the old Jewel, this CD isn't even worth the money. If you're looking for good CD's I suggest Jem - Finally Woken and Joss Stone - Mind, Body & Soul."
4,Well Done!,"I can honestly say that, for me, Jewel is one of those artists that you can never count on to do the same thing twice. This album, while not my favorite Jewel album (that's still ""Pieces of You"") is exceptional in its amazing vocals, lyrics, music and production. While it may be more of a hit with the young crowd (i.e Brittney, Shakira audiences), than the older folks (like me) who prefer her more raw, acoustic side, it still shows that Jewel has a tremendous gift for her craft. Great music like art should, at least occaisionally, stretch you a little beyond your comfort zone. This does for me - but is still worth every penny."
4,The New Jewel?,"I was excited about the release of this album. I have always liked Jewel's heartfelt and honest lyrics, in addition to her down home sound from her past three albums. If you are looking for the same thing with this new album be prepared to be surprised. It is totally different from anything she has previously released, with several dance tracks and upbeat tempoed songs. It seems that she is trying to follow the same track as Shania and Faith Hill but I think that the results in this album are much more appreciable. Her lyric writing abilities have not changed, despite the sound of the album. There are a few songs that would have fit rather nicely on the ""This Way"" album and some that are of a completly different style.All in all, if you are looking for the same artist from Pieces of You and Spirit, you will not find it on this album, but if you are a die hard Jewel fan as I am, you will find this a pleasant and welcome change to her previous work."
3,Sad But True,"I love Jewel, I love our words, I love her music, but most of all I love her message. Sadly enough though, her music and her message changed to be a part of the popular culture. Here's a passage from an article on her change:""I'd always thought electronic music was cold and pat and not very creative,"" she says. Yet she decided to try the remix treatment on ""Serve the Ego,"" a single from her previous release ""This Way."" The end result not only resonated personally but lifted Jewel to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart.Don't get me wrong, there are a few songs I like but there's not a total feel of ""This Way."""
2,"while dissapointed, Jewel is in there somewhere.......","While I don't approve of Jewel changing her style with EVERY album, until this CD She at least offered thoughtful and powerful lyrics and sounds.If I need another dance mix pop song drilled into my skull, I'll tune to any of dozens of radio stations in my area.What scares me the most, is how the last two stanzas of her 'intuition' lyrics are actually her TELLING her fans that she has sold out and that we can't do anything about it.This alone tells me that her lyrical talent has been turned to the dark side of the corporate commercial machine.The saddest part is that I'm sure the sales won't drop. Old Jewel fans will dissappear, but an army of mindless pop purchasers will fill that gap and spill over into huge profits for the industry.Please give us more 'Pieces Of You' and 'Spirit'"
1,Sad,"WHAT HAPPENED?!?!?!? When I first started listening to Jewel, she was an inspiration, she was famous and a well-respected artist, and nothing about her was manufactured. She was a breath of fresh air. Now, she has become everything I prayed she never would. How can people say that it is ""brave"" of her to do what will bring her the most money nowadays? In what universe is that brave? What would have been truely brave is if she had continued to refuse to be everything Hollywood tried to make her to be, and if she had just continued to be herself. Her music then was beautiful and MEANINGFUL. Now is just has a background beat. We all loved her then, what happened?"
1,What happened???,This is awful. What happened to the Jewel sound I used to know and love. I'm absolutely disgusted at this new album. Blegh. My loyalty has dropped 1000 points.
1,So you want to enter the Eurovision song contest for the UK?,"This album is awful. I've bought all of Jewel's previous work and I liked it. I was looking forward to this album. What a disappointment. It sounds like some piece of rubbish that a 1980's French pop act might have come up with and would be featured on Eurotrash for the rest of Europe to laugh at. Jewel, Nul points!"
3,so-so,"this wasn't the most brilliant CD ever made... it's kind of... well, i only listened to the whole thing once... other wise i just kind of skip around, not really finishing any song by intuition. if you're a huge jewel fan, i'd say you should get it, but if you aren't really a huge fan... save the money."
1,why did she sink so low?,"why jewel...why?!?! well the good thing is, is she sounds like her REGULAR self in concert still. performing her classics. ""you were meant for me"" ""hands"" ""break me"" just to mention a few. the reason why this album was made is to draw young, whiney, annoying, teenage girls. if you whiney little girls wanna hear PRODUCTIVE and GOOD music from Jewel, pick up one of her earlier albums, ""Pieces of you"" ""spirit"" or ""This Way"" they're 100000000000000000000% better than this crap. but who knows, maybe there is hope for her after all...(after seeing he in concert im starting to think so)"
3,What Happened?,"Since I first heard singles I enjoyed from Pieces of You, I enjoyed Jewel's music. The firt time I heard this CD was on the AOL free trial. I didn't listen to the words or anyhing, I just enoyed the music and it's energy, so I bought the CD. Jewel's new energy with the music was good, but the downfall of this was the words. I don't feel it lived up to my favorite Jewel CD ""Spirit."" I felt the lyrics didn't make you think, and were mostly about sex. Jewel talking about sex is OK once in awhile, but I thought this was the one track thought of the CD."
1,New Style - No thanks,"I have to add that I always enjoyed Jewel for songs like standing still, and her original folky sound with meaningful lyrics. If I wanted Brittney or Christina...I would buy them. I hate the term ""sold-out"", and maybe she is 'experimenting' with different sounds, but there are enough pop/dance/sound-a-like top 40 groups out there. I hope she didn't need the money that bad.The music on this album sounds canned and in no way stands out from the rest of the dance/pop junk already on the air waves. If you are 15 and love top 40, this album is for you!"
1,Someone needs to fix this no zero stars thing...,"... because that what this deserves*sigh*Why? I just want to ask her that? Why? What in the heck? You were talented Jewel, you first two CD's have been very important in my life. Your voice is beautiful, your lyrics make me cry, your MUSIC is beautiful...I can't listen to any more. I can't listen to Morning Song, Angel Standing By... I can't listen to any of it. Because you've ruined it with this trash. Congradulations, you've made pure beauty into wretched, sticking, shallow trite. Lets give you a round of applause, skinny little seventh graders LOVE your music, that's something to be proud of. Roll in your stench."
2,Has She Sold Out?,"I hate to say it, but as a long-standing fan of Jewel's I was very dissapointed at the release of this album. What had made Jewel unique from the rest of the stuff out there was her unique worldly view and expresive hamanistic lyrics. However, she seems to have ditched her past to persue a new ""trendy"" sound featuring empty, meaningless love-pop lyrics. I fear she has lost site of the true meaning she used to hold for a new sexy image and I find it a sad and pathetic waste of talent. jewel, please come back to us."
1,"Skip Jewel, get Plumb instead.","Her first single ""Intuition"" sounds awful. I've been a Jewel fan since her ""Pieces of You"" debut and it never occurred to me that her voice is nasal-sounding, that was till ""Intuition"" was released.Completely new sound, new tunes and a new image; which are quite distateful I might add. Those who like the previous or earlier versions of Jewel should give this album a miss.Instead, ""Plumb"" is highly recommended."
1,SELL OUT,"I had hoped it wasn't true, but it is ""Jewel sold out"" so she could sell cd's. Thought that would never happen. Jewel should be embarrassed with what she has done. She needs to go back to Texas and stay at the ranch until she finds her self again."
2,Nice Titles!,"While some might put effort in to song titles Jewel certainly breaks the mold and shows us that it isnt always the case. The choice wording on some of these tracks are great words like ""2"" or ""U"" . Im sure every child who chats online is going to love this CD just by reading the track selection! Track ""2"" (get it??) is the first glimpse we see of this bold style of naming but fear not it doesnt stop there! There are a grand total of 5 , yes 5! Unfortunatly track ""4"" ""Leave The Lights On"" seems a bit out of place.. 4 words.. none of them using the cool online wording.. this may prove to be the CD's downfall in the younger market. And as you can alredy see shes alienated herself from the older ""cooler"" generation. I can only hope for her next CD she doesnt play both sides the naming of songs is a serious bussniess shes been in the game long enough to know that."
5,She out did herself again 0304 rocks!,"Jewels modern folk lyrics presented in a variety of generes.""Leave the Lights on"" Jazz, ""Yes-u-Can"" Pop , There is something for all musical tastes on this one, well almost. You will have to listen to her older releases to here country this time. Something your kids can listen too without worry and Mom and Dad will enjoy it too. I love it! Definite winner here."
2,disappointed,I have to say Jewel is a great singer so when I heard her new album was going to be different I was looking forward to buying it. I like dance music and this is not what I expected. If you're looking to be blown away with this new cd you won't. She has a beautiful voice but I don't think this style is for her. I think Kylie Minougue's cd's are more dance than this.
4,different but definitely jewel,"0304 is definitely a departure for jewel, but lyrically it is still jewel. she is still sensitively commenting on society and love. On 0304 she explores more dance music without getting away from the music that made her famous. Though fans who have a narrower opinion of what makes for ""good"" music will hate it, those of us who like music that makes us smile will enjoy it to the fullest. I must say that at times I miss her guitar, but I appreciate her desire to do something different. I knew when I bought 0304 that it was not the ""typical"" Jewel CD and I am not disappointed."
1,Where is our Jewel ????????????!,"Where are gone the beautiful ballads, acoustic guitarsand all the rest that made Jewel's music so good.This new CD only seems to be a try to get teenagers interested in her music.She has been a victim of Kylie Minogue and Britney Spears influence. ( pink trousers on the photo to proove it! )I only hope this CD won't sell and that she will realise that she has done the wrong thing and is letting her fans down!We still like you a bit Jewel but change your clothes( and your sound )."
3,Really torn.....,"Day 2 and I'm the proud(???) new owner of Jewel's new CD...ummmOkay, so I'm having a really hard time reconcilling the old Jewel with the new one. And all of you who say this is just a new ""side"" - have you listened to Pieces of You lately? I love Jewel. Always have. I just cringe when I listen to most of her new CD. And do NOT get me started on the cutesy abbreviations ""2 Find U???""(ICK!) Britney and Christina keep coming to mind - and I really don't want them to. I'm all for artists evolving, trying new things, but I can't help feeling that this album is a bubblegum candy wrapper covering the honest, raw Jewel I love. The lyrics aren't even as smart as we've heard from her before. She has always been so great with making powerful, yet simple lyrics that can get right to the heart. What happened?Anyway, I'm really trying to like it - but the new album just makes me want to listen to Pieces of You....."
1,*pfffft*,"well????? what happened to the album i was counting down days for? this is.... pop. its techno. its trash. its unjewel!!!!! *sighs* what happened to the amazing girl who sang 'angel standing by', 'absence of fear', 'pieces of you'.. i mean i find it difficult to believe that you could go from 'life uncommon' to 'intuition'.. and whats with the ""2"" and the ""U""?.. since when did jewel not know how to spell? I'm pretty disappointed.. definately not close to what jewel is capable of."
