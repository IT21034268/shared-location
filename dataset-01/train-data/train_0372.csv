2,Stop referring to graphs & fig. that are on the next page!,It's so annoying to read about graphs and figures that appear on the next page. If the authors are going to cite these visual tools have them on the same page whenever possible. Of course it is unrealistic to expect that everytime but in the K&R book this occurred 90% of the times. It's annoying when you have to flip the pages. This annoyance knocked 3 stars from what would have been a 5-star rating.What's right about the text?The economics is sound and the teaching is concise. Bravo in that regard.
1,Too wordy for what the book is trying to teach.,"The books is too wordy for the simple economics it is trying to teach and it lacks direction in some subjects. It also missed essential concepts like kinked demand theory, and the Chamberlain Model."
4,One of my favorite live-action Disney films,"Jodie Foster stars as a juvenile delinquent/orphan named Casey who's in the right place at the right time -- and has the right look. A con man hires her to pose as the long-lost granddaughter of a rich English woman (played by Helen Hayes), who lives in a big house/castle called Candleshoe. The catch? There's a treasure hidden somewhere in Candleshoe, the con man knows about it, and he wants Casey to find it. At first, it's easy for Casey to dupe ""Grandma"", her butler, and the four precocious orphans who also live at Candleshoe. But before long, Casey begins to feel a little guilty about what she's doing. This is a wonderful movie, with great performances by Foster, Hayes, and David Niven as the Candleshoe butler. It is one of my favorite life-action Disney films. This DVD has the movie in full screen, widescreen, and has scene selection."
5,Great Movie!,Love this movie! Good family night movie! Very clean! Good for ages five and up! Much cheeper here than anywhere else!
4,Wonderful memories,"I grew up with this movie. It was one of my family's favorites. As an adult and a parent, I cringe at Jody Foster's character, but she does change in the end."
5,Good memories,"Had to have this one. I loved it as a kid, and my kids loved it on video tape. Now on DVD, we can hae it for future generations to enjoy. The cast is perfectly, picked, and the plot is endearing.Sseller did a great job."
4,Candleshoe,"Helen Hayes and David Niven are always outstanding and this is no exception. They bring real old world charm to what might otherwise be a bit too pre-teen slapstick ""children vs. crooks"". Overall very good family entertainment showing solid principles of individual contribution for family success and unity."
5,Childhood Memories,I can remember seeing this movie in the theater ... it was the first movie my mom took me and my sister to see. It is a Disney classic!
4,Great movie for the whole family,"I loved this movie whenI was a kid, so I purchased it for my kids and they loved it."
3,"Easy to follow ""spanglish"" recipes....",I purchased this book for my lovely girlfriend. I love the fact that the recipes are in spanish & english (spanglish). I highly recommend this book to the first time cook or the part time cook or the spanish cook who would like to try english recipes but cannot find a spanish cookbook!! Good recipes too---very yummy!
4,This is the first...,"As I undertand it, this is the first novel portraying the character of Perry Mason and he doesn't display several of the characteristics Gardner would put into him later; he is rather hard with his client, but he is entitled to, because as his client's husband ends up dead, Mason appears to be the main suspect."
5,Simply the best money can buy,"I bought this saw about a year ago and wanted to report that I absolutely love it. I use it for rips, cross-cuts and dados. I have it wired for 220V (very easy to do). It's a real workhorse. I have never been able to even strain it - not even with 8/4 oak.I could go on and on but many have detailed the great features, etc. If you have the money and the room and are looking for a true cabinet saw with no weak features or compromise, this is it."
4,Greg A.,I'm not going to re-write all the positive things others have written because they are all true. I have had this saw for two and a half years and I have only one complaint....I have replaced the casters twice. Once was my fault for not lowering the saw when I was not using after putting it away and the wheels tread came apart. But the next time I religiously lowered the saw each time it was moved and I have had a third wheel come apart. I would suggest the saw equipped with wheels rated for the weight of the saw and this would not be an issue.
2,Great saw but poor Amazon service,"I purchased my PM2000 in mid-September; it's a great saw and I've no issue with it at all. Powermatic is offering a $100 Gift Card promotion with the purchase of this saw. Amazon did not include anything about the gift card with the saw. I sent Amazon an email and they washed their hands of it saying ""this offer is a transaction between you and the manufacturer, you will need to direct all future communication to Powermatic"". Funny as I ordered my saw from Amazon.I called Powermatic Customer Service a few weeks ago and they asked me to email a copy of Amazon's response to them. It's been three weeks now and I've heard nothing back from Powermatic or Amazon. I phoned Powermatic ""Customer Service"" again today and they took my name/number but did not call me back."
1,Not a Powermatic fan anymore,Powermatic used to make their products in the USA. Now most are made in China. Let the Chineese buy them then. I won't buy Powermatic tools.
3,China's WideScreen Results in Weak Transfer,"Just took delivery of ""The Egyptian"" WideScreen that I located from eCrater.....Viewing this film on a 52"" RCA HDTV, I would like to warn the readers that the China release is NOT of good quality. It's ok viewing from a normal distance.There is some noise in the filmZooming shows horrible display outputs.Audio is Stereo Only.$11.00 isn't really all that bad for a new disc. Just be warned it is a low-quality transfer."
2,Korean subtitles can not be turned off,"The distracting Korean subtitles have a menu item to select ""none"", but that item does not work. If you don't mind the distraction, that's fine. For me -- The constantly changing glyphs destroy the presentation."
2,PStrickland,"This is one of my favorite movies. I wanted it for some friends. When it came most of the writting on the cover was in chinese on the front cover. The format makes a large black margin around the picture and the picture is much smaller than the screen. Thank goodness the language was in English. I love the movie, but was disapointed by the way the copy was reproduced. It really looked like an illegal copy."
5,the egyptian,"great story - excellent actors - import; only complaint - copy, not great quality - could be better."
4,The Egyptian,"This is a classic movie with many old stars, but delightfully well made. It surprises at the end when it tells that the Egyptian Pharaoh worshipped one god centuries before the birth of Christ."
2,THE EGYPTIAN,"Too much black space above and below picture, Asian script at bottom was distracting. After 15 minutes gave up on watching the movie until I found something to block my view of the Asian script. Regretable purchase."
5,I really hope they Make a game with the same idea!,"This movie has the coolest begining, all i wish is that they kept collectin money, but it is still a very creative movie, and should be seen if not owned!"
5,Interesting insight,"For a short paperback work, the author provided some interesting insight of how different Native American tribes used scalping and torture for economic and political reasons. In addition, on how the practice was routinely accepted as part of their culture on a wide scale. No matter what the reason it definitely made a major impact on the colonial society, and deterred expansion for decades. The book gives detailed accounts of attacks and retributions for incursions by white colonials and other Native tribes, with the harshest punishment it seems done against other Natives. A must read for those studying the frontier and colonial eras."
5,This video will DEFINITELY kick your butt!!!,"I got this video because I'm attempting to collect most of the videos shot in the elaborate studio as they are the best of the FIRM videos. I thought Susan Harris in #1 was a beast...Janet Jones is a MONSTER! The floor exercises will work your arms like you won't believe (I couldn't finish all the reps with the poundage used in the video). While it's really difficult to finish, you know you're gonna get the body you're after with this and all the other ""original"" FIRMs. Her breathy voice is not annoying at all, and for the most part, the times that she did not cue were after she already did a set of the exercise already and she's just doing it again. In my opinion, the floor routine is harder than Susan's in #1, but it's still really good. If you want to get in shape and FAST, get this video!"
2,Blah,"The best thing about this book on CD is the narrator's voice. It's so charming and pleasant! The book is okay, a little too informative on things I don't care about, but I wished for more information on Jane Austen! There was a lot of detail about all her siblings, but I didn't feel there was much about Jane Austen herself. Very disappointed."
3,Doesn't fit like OEM for the S2000,"Said it was compatible for the S2000, and it is... but not exactly like OEM.OEM pulley is covered by a dust shield that indents inward, so the pulley's bearing is also a bit recessed, however, with this pulley, the dust shield hits the pulley itself and prevents it from spinning. I just stuck a washer in between the shield and the bearing to give it a little extra room and it runs fine... just not 100% compatible."
2,Disappointing,This movie had all the potential to be a lot of fun. Unfortunately it does not deliver.
3,Late review,"Poor acting and a drawn out plot really made this quite the bore for me.. Other movies from this period aren't as slow or cheesy as this one, and I have no problem taking myself back to the mid-90's.. Worth the watch if you don't own it.."
3,"The movie sucks, the story rocks!",To me is very simple: I really enjoy sci-fi movies and even more if they are horros movies. The whole idea of an alien life form using us as spare-parts scares the Jesus out me hence it is very attractive as well jejeje. I really like this movie. Actually i'm getting a replacement copy since i lost the one i had before.
1,No suspense. No horror. Special effects are like that of a TV show. Acting is below par.,"The movie is basically ""Robots attacking a ship"". It contains no suspense and no horror. Special effects are like that of a TV show. Acting is below par. Donald Sutherland is ridiculous with his extremely dumb role of the Captain.It's a waste of time and money."
2,Funny,This has to be one of the worst movies ever made...I gave it 2 stars just because it made me laugh in the process...what was donald sutherland thinking along with Jamie Lee Curtis! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone...
1,HELLO ? IS THERE ANYBODY THERE !,"THis is almost unbeliavable ! I think William Baldwin stil has time to turn around his career and get away from lousy productions like that. I like horror, but this is a completely heartless production, from a director who is beginning at this job. Sutherland is in his ""Michael Caine"" phase, accepting any script they offer him, what is a great thing, because producers generally have prejudice with older actors. About Curtis, I think she did great, because she didn't try to develop a character which had absolutely nothing to develop. Now, let's talk about the movie. The plot is ludicrous, nobody explains what were the reasons of the aliens. But there is one good point: at the end, there was absolutely no clue that we may have a sequence ! Great!"
3,What a gore fest,"Man, I just about puked when the scene with the machines slicing up bodies for spare parts came up. This movie is hardly a rip-off though. The plot is as original as can be. How do you know whether or not the writers had had this idea on their own, and it just happened to be like a Jim Cameron film? An alien lifeform comes to Earth in electrical form, almost impossible to battle because it can find a new mechanic host whenever it pleases. I don't want to spoil it, but I'll just say that the ending was completely wrong. It's one of those movies that's a good rental, but will sit on your shelf indefinately if you buy it."
4,BoBo the Monkey,"I believe that this movie was really good. The special effects were really neat. The plot is farfetched but it was pretty cool. A vius from outerspace takes over a Russian ship and enslaves all of it's crew as robots. Something rips them apart and puts them back together only with lots of metal and wiring. When Jamie Lee and her crew's little boat gets destroyed, they must go on the Russain ship. To Jamie and her crews horror, they find it crawling with deadly machines. It then becomes their job to stop it before it takes over the world. NOT THE BEST MOVIE but pretty cool. Not everything has to make sence, it is just their to be enjoyed."
1,a sad day,"while a big fan of jamie lee curtis, the monsters came out too quickly, leaaving nothing for the imagination. the special effects boys kept trying to outdo themselves but bottomed out by the middle of the movie, leaving you disappointed."
1,Jamie was right,"Her posting on IMDB says it all. She's got 'em beat when it comes to ""bad movie"" credits. Even the writing becomes obviously tortured at times."
4,Fun Summer Flick,"Yes, the critics hated this movie but I thought it was pretty good. Lots of chills and thrills and plenty of action. Quite a bit of gore but it's pretty common now in horror/sci-fi films. Curtis does a nice job as the tough female lead."
1,This Movie is really really bad,"This movie had the worst acting you couldd think of, and its special effects sucked! the plot was dumb, and its was just a really bad movie! No doubt about that!"
4,Chill Thrill,"The first thing that came to my mind when i saw this movie was: That it is a mixture Terminator and Deep rising.The Beginning is cool when the V.I.R.U.S Enters the Mir Space station.and transfers itself to the russian research vessel.I read the comic and missed one thing, and that was the machine at the end with the saw on its hand.But this film keeps you in the loop every second of the film,.See it and love it."
4,Excellent Sci Fi Movie,"I have read most of the reviews on this page and feel that they are unfair. Virus is a cross betwwen Aliens and Deep Rising. The Special Effects are great. Donald Sutherland, Jamie Lee Curtis, and William Baldwin portray their roles well enough to make this movie palatable to even the non sci fan fan. Overall, this film is fairly fast paced and entertaining. My rating of 4 starts is for a movie in the sci fi genre. Fans of Science Fiction/ Horror will love this movie. For those, I would recommend a purchase. All others I would recommend renting this first so you can gain your opinion."
3,"i rate it a ""meh""..., but GREAT Dolby mix","Story: crew in tight quarters being hunted down by... something.Script/dialogue: no real laughs or suspense.Special effects: surprising. Makes you wish CGI went away, and more college kids played with latex and squibs.Acting: Jamie Lee Curtis: credible job. Donald Sutherland: LAUGHABLY bad accent. William Baldwin: looked pretty when he had to. Joanna Pakula: played someone pretty with an accent.Dolby audio: the only reason I gave this DVD 3 stars. AMAZING! Set your receiver to Dolby enhanced EX or an equivalent. I was going to use the DVD as trade bait in a used DVD shop until I watched it and was stunned by the effort that went into the audio mix. Not exactly ""Master & Commander', but very good for its time."
2,Donald Sutherland is Cool,"There really isn't much to say about this cliched garbage. Soo many overtones of better movies like ALIEN, THE RELIC, MIMIC, and most of all, DEEP RISING. I am only giving it two stars for its entertainment quality, awesome cast, and special effects. It is BEYOND me how they dragged Donald Sutherland into this mess."
3,Mediocre,"The idea for the film is a good one. An alien virus powered by electricity takes control of a Russian vessel and decides to rid the ship of its human inhabitants. Jamie Lee Curtis and her fellow crew members discover the stranded ship. They soon find themselves trapped on board and battling their way out. Unfortunately, the alien ends up looking like a rejected model for the Terminator. There's really nothing new or innovative about the film. If you've seen any of the ""Alien"" films, ""The Abyss,"" or ""Leviathan,"" you've pretty much seen all the events that occur in ""Virus."" It's not a horrible film, but it's not a great one either. It'd be a good film to watch when bored."
3,"Bad Acting, Good Effects","I've been seeing alot of bad reviews for this movie and a few good ones. While it is true that the characters are not well developed and the acting was not so good, the special effects were pretty good. The big four-legged leviathan at the end was one of the best sci-fi ""monsters"" I've seen. Maybe there were too many scenes that seemed designed to gross out the audience rather that to add to the plot, but what can you do? The ending was a disappointment, though. The people just jumped in a little metal-plated room and flew away and the ship blew up. After watching the big cyborg get blown up by a rocket and a compressed oxygen tank and still not die, I would have enjoyed watching the stupid thing finally burn, but that didn't happen."
1,CRAP! CRAP! CRAP! CRAP!,"This movie was the Telletubbies sci-fi movie of the late '90's.OH MY GOD i cant beleive how let down i was when I saw this.Instead of the ""next leading Science fictian movie"",It creates a peice of (...) that makes the whole story (and Jamie lee Curtis,such a cool actress) Look like some peice of drama crap.The following is for those who like it: (...)"
1,"Like most viruses, this one's hard to stomach","About 30 minutes into this movie I turned to my wife and said, ""Man! This is stupid!"" But, the type of person that only needs a little entertainment to like a movie, I stuck it out. Mistake! It didn't get any better. Stupid story line. Horrible script. Bad acting. Hey! The special effects were at least interesting! That's where the 1 star came from! Avoid it like the plague!"
1,"Sorry, but....","I was disappointed in this movie because I really like Jamie Lee Curtis as an actress. And, I still liked her in the movie. However, the plot was ridiculously unbelievable, and the other characters were underdeveloped. Donald Sutherland's character was too unpredictable and used too conviently by the screenwriters to try to move the plot along. As for William Baldwin, I just don't think he's come along as an actor. And overall, the pacing of the movie was cumbersome. Definitely skip this one."
1,IT ALMOST GETS WATCHABLE,"In my country, I don't think this film even made it to cinemas, and after seeing it I know why. I was warned away from this film, I watched simply out of morbid curiousity and plead with others not to make the same mistake. Fortunately it is fairly low profile. You can't blame the actors, we've seen they are all good at their jobs - a bit past their prime - but still good. It was the script, and the effects left something to be desired. What's more, there's just too much Russian at the start, and they forgot to put in all the subtitles. It starts slow, and hovers between watchable and just plain bad. In the end, it just wasn't watchable enough."
2,Why such a waste of talent?,"Jaime Curtis didn't have to do this movie. She was miscast -- majorly miscast. If you wanna see a good movie from Jaime, then rent ""Mother's Boys"" or ""Halloween"" or ""Halloween: H20."" Just don't watch this. No suspense at all. Only character development the fact that you know what they do on the ship. Donald Sutherland did a fair job. But he wasn't miscast. Wanna see a good movie from Sutherland, go rent ""The Puppet Masters"" or something like that. Not this! This is one of the worst films of 1999."
3,Great flick,Big Jamie Lee fan and she didn't disappoint. The storyline is creepy...machines thinking on their own using humans for parts.
2,A big disapointment,"If you're expecting suspension or to get scared, don't waste your time with this movie. The title Virus makes no sense according to the story line. The 'half-machine, half-human' will only make you lose your appetite for a couple of days. This movie seems to me like an imitation of John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" which I enjoyed very much. At the end of the movie, you'd still sit there...waiting for something else to happen..."
1,Save your money!,"Aliens meet the Borg. Deadful, just dreadful. Sutherland ""phones it in"" Oh yea, it ""sounds"" good."
3,DVD sound at its Best,"Sound effects incredible, took full use of sub woofer and most impresively the rear speakers. Heard sound eminating from all 4 directions with clarity, how all movies should be made and or transferred. great visuals, intriguing story. The only bad point was Curtis was horrible in this role, Sutherland was well Sutherland. I am a fan of all sci-fi and this one is not bad. If you like sci-fi, great sound effects and interesting plot this will entertain you. If not get it or rent it to see how good DVD can be when studios do the sound the way it should be"
1,This movie is one of the lowest type of film making......,"With William Baldwin, already thats one strike off. This moie was the worst movie I had ever seen since Exorist II: The Heretic. Forget this movie, it doesn't even deserve 1 star."
3,It's All Been Done Before---and Better,"""Virus"" is one of those cookie-cutter genre movies. It's similar in nature to ""Deep Rising"" which was much better because it didn't take itself that seriously, and the heroes were all villains! (Except Treat of course!). Jamie Lee looks bored in her role; Donald Sutherland overacts shamelessly; only Joanna Pacula gives a professional and believable performance. The special effects vary from very good (the robotic sequences) to amateurish (the storm scenes). We even saw the platform the boat was on in two different scenes. The music was also annoying; it didn't seem to enhance, only distract. On the plus side, it does have some tense moments and is overall worth a rental and night of popcorn."
1,I NEED SOME MEDICINE AFTER WATCHING THIS VIRUS !,"This is one of the worst science-horror movies I've ever seen, what is a sad thing, because the cast, with Curtis, W.Baldwin and D. Sutherland, is very good to a production in which you see, since the cover, that is low-budget. The movie itself has no absurd flaw (it's natural to this genre to be absurd, so nothing is strange. That's what I mean). The problem is the total lack of rhythm and acting that the director didn't extract from them."
2,"Casts' Performances good, Poor Contents and short Story","My DTS copy is not included with English subtitles, why ? The movie comes with mediocre and inconvincible contents. Jamie and Donald played fine specially Donald is impressive by being a captain at the ship. 100 minutes for this movie is terribly short, the story could be made with better longer continuing contents. I should make a kick to this movie's story writer. Who is he/she ?"
4,Interesting concept.....,"This was a good flick. Very entertaining. This is a horror/sci-fi flick. Similar to the Alien series.Jamie has done better films, but she is equal to the task on this film. William Baldwin also does ok for a beginner. Donald Sutherland is his typical self. He can be counted on to play his characters convincingly.The premise of the film is a lifeform that exists as energy. It needs to find bodies to do it's work. A Russian trawler (spy ship) just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The virus is able to download itself to their computers and so the horror begins..... Add a huge hurricane and there you are.If it weren't for the special effects, this would be a B grade movie. There were some really cool shots of the robotics that the virus is able to create from the machines and humans that were on the ship.Anyway, this one is worth at least two viewings. I've seen it three times, including once on broadcast TV."
1,Astonishingly bad.,"Virus makes a mistake at every turn. It's stupid, boring, and senseless. Rather than being campy like Deep Rising, it takes itself too seriously, thus there's no entertainment factor present at all. Though the film may sound intriguing to sci-fi fans, I would avoid at all costs."
2,Worth the rental at your local video store,"I'm glad I rented instead of buying this DVD. It's a fairly fast pace movie with decent SFX, but you never get into the movie or relate to the characters. It's a bit flat, missing the itensity of a really good SciFi thriller. I'd rent it first before considering the purchase."
2,"Poor, Poor, Poor.","I would like to say that I can give a complete review of this movie, but 40 minutes into it I shut it off. Great sound from the audiophile prospective, but the movie seemed very unbelievable, over acted, and down right corny. Don't waist your time with this one."
4,Teaching Yond chilren With Autism,"this book has been wonderful in having info on hand about this disorder, to give you ideas and help you know how to handle this type of issue that is in your care."
5,Crossing Borders,"Crossing borders without inspection is fraught with dangers from thieves, rapists and murderers, especially with the invasion of the drug cartels in the last few years into the border region. Daniel Groody, a noted Catholic theologian priest at Notre Dame University is well know for his work and his on the ground research with undocumented immigrants along US-Mexico Border and in other border regions of the world. This work is a moving look into the spirituality and struggles of such immigrants that cannot fail to humanize this very vulnerable group of people."
3,Critique of Xuron Kevlar shears,"The problem of the fineness and toughness of Kevlar fiber should be known to all that handle and manufacture products from Kevlar. There are other shears that are designed to cut Kevlar fiber. This particular set of shears works but the shearing blades are short and thus limited in their use. If you are looking for more generally usable shears for Kevlar do some research and make sure you purchase the ones that are most applicable for your requirement. Look at the 1 X 8"" Bent Kevlar Shear (18425) ($29.95) from [...] , it cuts the Kevlar as well and is more like a regular pair of scissors."
5,Great Read Aloud,"I love this book. I bought a dino egg puppet to support the story and I read it to my second graders each year. I love the surprise ending. My dino puppet has the same ""surprise"" dino that apppears at the end of the story which excites the kids all the more. Great book to add to your home and classroom library."
1,My son does not like,"My son (3yr) did not like this book. I am not sure why. I had a hard time reading some of the pages to him. One page references yucky vegetables, not what I am trying to teach my son. We were both disappointed. 3yr may be to young for this book."
5,Agree- The Best Loop Guru,"This release is one of the first three I bought from Loop Guru. The pieces on this record still sort give you the Loop Guru signature tease towards the trance beat, but in general these pieces have more hard percussive bites to them. For those not familiar with Loop Guru, they were popular on the rave curcuit in the early nineties right through the late nineties. The beats that the band generates are infectous, yet sort of calming at the same time. Even this slightly, harder-edged recording lends itself to this kind of effect. Intellengent music. Mostly instramental. A Most-Worthy spin!"
2,Lovely But Cold,"You'd expect a sample-driven project to equal at least the sum of its parts. Oddly, Loop Bites Dog gets nowhere by using samples (and instruments?) from the already over-exploited third world. The music is passable easy-listening fare, relaxing and accomodating, but its tissue-paper depth is frustrating to more engaged ears. Looking for a challenge? Try Autechre or Aphex Twin."
4,"PRETTY GOOD, GOOD DSXCRIPTIONS,I WAS A LRRP THEN","I WAS A LRRP AT THE SAME TIME AND IN THE SAME AREA AS HE WAS ,I ENJOYED A LOT OF THE BOOK BUT NEEDED MORE DETIAL ABOUT WHAT WE WERE AND WHY WE DID WHAT WE DID ,NEEDED TO GIVE BETTER PROFILE ON HIS SELF BUT OVERALL A VERY GOOD BOOK AND QUITE FACT INTENSE. I LEFT NAM IN SEPT 67"
5,An inspirational walk through the Lenten season.,"This short volume is a heart rending, soul opening treasure for the celebration the Lenten season and in preparation for Easter.It is a sort of Stations of the Cross, using the words of the Gospels to take your heart and mind into worship and prayer particularly relevant to the season.It should be in print. It is priceless.I would recommend it to believers, new and old."
2,Not as good as the original,"With the original version, multiple games could be printed on one sheet of paper to complete at your leisure. In this version, more trees are killed because you only have the ability to print one game per one sheet of paper. Other than that, this game software is what I anticipated and I am satisfied with the product."
2,Boooring,My child likes to watch all of the Disney Singalongs. This one is sooo boring and doesn't hold her attention at all.
2,For Sing Along Fans Only,"HOME ON THE RANGE is probably the worst Disney animated feature ever- and then they brought out a DVD to coincide with that bitter disappointment of a movie. This DVD takes on the form of a mini-story based on the movie and features Home On The Range songs, and western related songs. Unless you are a fan of this type of music or simply a Disney Sing Along Songs fan, run for the hills and avoid."
2,cowboy,Do any of you know whether this DVD includes a clip of 'A Cowboy Needs A Horse' from an old disney short film ? It'll be great if anyone could confirm this
3,An incomplete version,"If you want the full version of Out of Africa, this is not the audio book for you - its abridged."
2,Hindsight,"This was the first of many books I've read about Africa. At the time, I had a romanticized view of The Dark Continent, a naive view.After doing some more research, I realize Karen Blixen's view was VERY romanticized. Many of her contemporaries thought her somewhat odd and out of touch with reality.If you want a lyrically told story colored with emotion...this is for you.If you're interested in Africa as it really was, read a selection of accounts by settlers who spent far more time, and ranged over a wider area."
2,Not quite like the movie,"After watching the movie, I was eager to read the actual story it was based on...Oh my....a bit of a ""yawn"". Didn't make it even 1/3 through; just couldn't stay interested. More of a day to day diary of her life on the coffee plantation and not nearly as interesting or historically the same as the movie...I think the movie may have taken a lot of creative license to make it interesting. However, it does give a very good description of life in Africa in the early 1900's."
4,Aunt Bub,My book club read this book for our June book. We had a lively discussion about the relationship between the various characters in the novel. We commented on the rich language and all agreed we were given an insight into that part of Africa. We were split 6-4 in favor of the book.
3,Fascinating look at a different time,"This reads more like a collection of short stories of things she remembers from having a coffee farm in Africa. They are true stories which makes it more interesting to me. It can get a little dry since there is no overall plot, but it's still a fascinating look at a different life and times. Isak Dinesen was a pen name for Karen Blixen and she was an inspiring and independent woman. The book is pretty similar to the movie. I really liked it."
5,Out of the common places,"Never wrote a woman a better book in my opinion, where epic, liric and ethic intermingle into the most beautiful prose ever written, only a spark away from poetry self. And not only art and beauty are comprised within the landscapes, characters and adventures, but also the hints of profound respect, gratitude and understanding of life and fellow partisans."
4,Some scattered fragmented passages can't derail the power,"For anyone who's ever had to leave somewhere and never forgotten it, this is a must read.You really get a strong sense of heartache here when Blixen is forced to give up her plantation toward the end of the book. I think the final pages of this story are some of the saddest ever written in literature. And yes, you can call someone's memoirs literature.While the fine film version is based on three books, this is the definitive, haunting one which expertly, more than any visual medium, describes what it's like to be possessed by a place. More than Blixen being in Africa, this is more like Africa being in Blixen."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed as it told very little about her relationship with Denys Finch-Haddon, and I had just read his biography TOO CLOSE TO THE SUN. I am now reading Isaak Denisen's biography, which I hope will be more interesting."
5,a return to africa,how can the reader not adore her? ten stars for karen blixen........and 100 for africa........where we honeymoned in 1970. i went back to nairobi with izak dinesen.
4,Really good when you think back over it,"I'll agree with everyone else in that for the first 3/4 of the book, I had no idea where I was headed. And then 'it' happened and the last 1/4 redeemed the entire story.Although the first 3/4 is a bit lacking in action, it contains images of war-torn Europe and wonderful characterizations of the people who lived among the ruins that I will never forget.Begin it, stick with it, and enjoy it."
2,The Innocent,"The Innocent was an okay novel of cold war espionage, but ultimately too bland a plot to suit my tastes. The characters were not developed enough during the main part of the story. The flash ahead of 30 years seemed too contrived and lazy to be an effective ending."
1,Slumming author wastes time of both of us,"The Innocent pretentiously invites a comparison with Kafka's The Castle, and then belabors it over 200 pages that prove satisfactory as neither serious novel or spy yarn. The point that spy work is often absurd has been made, thank you very much, dozens of times before; and the main character is such an astonishing drip and dolt (taking up with an East German woman who practically has Mata Hari stamped on her forehead) that it's impossible to care about his progress from virgin idiot to non-virgin idiot. Some will no doubt say that that's the point of the book, that Leonard is a real character, not a Follett-Ludlum (or even Greene-LeCarre) fantasy. To me, the fantasy is that he could have survived Basic Training without getting killed by either his own stupidity or his fellow recruits for the good of England...."
3,How NOT to dispose of your pesky ex.,The detailed description of how two of the characters carve upa corpse and put the pieces into suitcases--and then try to carry thevery heavy suitcases--is worth the price of the book.
2,Really repulsive book,"I generally like McEwan's work, and he is a gifted writer.But this book describes a murder in which the corpse ischopped up piece by piece, dripping blood and gore,and it is truly nausea-making."
3,"A very dark read, even for McEwan","I don't know how I misssed this earlier work by the author. Very much a McEwan work: the ravages of time against the intensity of emotion and experience of the present moment. This story is terribly bleak and savage, to the point where I actually skipped several paragraphs where I found the violent descriptions were just too much. I would have given it maybe four stars but for a very tedious beginning and a few too many misses on the American character of the Cold War. McEwan fans who have already read his other works and who, like me, might have missed this one will want to read it; newcomers to his world should pass this one up for ""Saturday,"" ""Atonement"" or ""On Chesil Beach"" to get them into the groove before moving onto to ""Solar"" and then maybe backtracking to ""The Innocent."""
4,A Thriller or A Horror?,"I'm now reading Ian McEwan's The Innocent - OMG! Newsweek said, ""So exhaustively suspenseful that it should be devoured at one sitting."" NYTimes, ""Powerfull and disturbing...a tour de force."" I expected a thriller but if this were a movie I would have to cover my eyes during parts of the story. It's very, very well written and suspenseful but POW!!! you will be surprised, even horrified, by the secrets hidden in the pages of this masterpiece.Tedde McMillenAuthor of Million Dollar Cup of TeaMillion Dollar Cup of Tea: What You Can Learn from a Mother-daughter Team Who Turned a Simple Idea into Oregon Chai: a $75 Million Business"
3,Bit of a surprise,"Again, a great read by Ian McEwan. Evocative, real but a tiny bit confronting this time. I confess there was at least 1 chapter I just couldn't read...."
2,Too tedious to finish,"After forty+ years of reading, there are probably five novels I did not finish. I just do not like to quit. After thirty or so pages, there was still nothing that encouraged me to finish this novel. I quit reading it. Some novels grab you on the first page and do not let go while others build interest page after page. This novel was flat from the first page onward. This was the first novel from this author I tried. It will also be the last."
5,Excellent Movie,"I saw this movie on TV, it was under the name Avalanche. I tried to find it everywhere. One day a stumbled across it at a movie shop in the mall. I was sooooo happy. The special effects in this movie are far from today's standards, but the characters I believe are worth it. I am happy to have it in my collection."
4,Average Fare With Caroleen Feeney,Some good photography of Alaska and the native wildlife. The acting is 3 stars and the scenery is 5 stars. There are exciting special effects and exciting flying in a two-seater airplane. A large avalanche is very dramatic in the second half of the film. Most of the action in the film in total is in the second half.
3,Exactly... CORNBALL THRILLER!,"There is a little bit of everythiing in this movie - plot, pretext, suspense, action, mystery, and romance.There's nothing wrong with this movie..... and of course it's cornballed. Thomas Ian Griffith is famous for those."
4,Pretty Good Hard Drive Cooler,"It works well and isnt too bad to install, you will need room below your hard drive you install it on, but its quiet and moves plenty of air. It did take a bit of trial and error to get it attached but it works fine for the 10$ i spent on it."
5,Wonderful cooler,"This Ultra cooler make my H.DD Seagate 320GB SATA300 16mb chache from 42C down to 31 to 33C max !!! .. very very quit with quality fan .. and good price .. have it with in 2 month ,,, plan to take 2 more :)"
5,Ryobi replacement spool,"Item ordered was an exact fit for the broken original part and was promptly delivered, all at a reasonable price."
1,to used for my liking,The book is well used and the several pages are loose there is highlighting through out the book and red ink written all over the book. I was not aware that used could mean so well used that no one else could read the book with all of the marks in the book.
3,The Blood Covenant,Order received timely and in good shape. This book was recommended by the teacher of a class I was taking. I found the text to be difficult to read as it was small and light ink.
2,Newer addition appears to be slightly better. . .,"While this is an excellent book to draw some basics from, there are several typos that are confusing to athletic training students. The chapter about hand and digit injuries is particularly atrocious. Their is a newer version that addresses some of this edition's many many flaws. Starkey may be an expert in the field, but he needed better editors for this book!As for the BOC exam, get yourself the delineation study to focus on the areas that make up the majority of the exam, purchase and utilize a study guide, and take the time to actually study."
5,A Must Have,"While I agree that the recording is uneven, there's so much that's wonderful. My personal favorite is Wilson Cruz's definitive performance of ""A Little More Mascara."" Also noteworthy are Rod McKuen's ""Look Over There,"" Nancy Dussault's ""Where in the World is My Prince,"" Rita Moreno on ""I Won't Send Roses,"" Tyne Daly, Dale Kristien on ""Love Look in my Window"" and so many more. Kym Hoy on ""Loving You"" was a nice surprise, too."
4,Better than all the rest,"I tried a H-P 1115....took it back in two days. What I REALLY like about the Epson Stylus 890 is there are no bells and whistles on the outside of the printer. It's body is firm, compact and sturdy looking. You absolutely MUST use Epson papers with this printer. Everything else has an ""etched"" or raised outline look to the objects in a photo. The regular photo paper is good, but the Premium Glossy Photo Paper is best. You also have to watch out for too much ""pink"" in lower resolutions. The higher resolutions do best with color. You can even go in and adjust the individual colors and I'd suggest doing just that on lower resolutions. (I tried a minus 15 on the magenta...and that looked about right.) It does eat up color cartridges but they aren't too expensive at [somewhere else]. It has a top load feed so you can't put it on a higher shelf (as in some Armoires.)All in all, I'd say it's a good, quality printer that prints photo quality prints."
5,I love it!,"Bought my 890 back in June and have had great results! It was really easy to set up with my Mac G4 and comes with some great software (Epsons Film Factory). I have had loads of fun taking pictures with my digital camera and then printing them off right after. Talk about instant gratification! I decided to make the switch to digital because I was sick and tired of all the crappy photo's I took with my regular 35mm camera. Even though they were crappy, I still paid for them with traditional photo developing. Now with my 890 I can print only the pictures that turn out, thus saving lots of cash (yes I factored in the cost of ink and paper). The best part is, and this is no lie, you can't tell the diffence from a traditionally developed picture. At least I can't, but I am not a proffesional. I love this printer and would highly recommend it."
5,amazing printer well worth the money,this is an amazing printer. i am able to print professional looking 8 x 10 for less than $.75 the printer is fast and does not jam.
2,Poor reliability,"I had this printer for 2 years, then had to trash it when it started printing blue lines across everything. It also had a tendency to smear ink. It isn't smart enough to tell when it's printing off the paper, which can happen if you're using poorly documented software (which includes the software bundled with the printer). When it was cooperating, it was great; but that hasn't happened for a few months now. Time for something more reliable."
2,You only rent this printer...,"Here's the other side of all those Amazon reviews that start with ""I just opened up the box, and the print quality is great!!"" This machine slurps up ink. When the color cartridge runs out, the printer refuses to print anything (like that black & white page you really need right now) until you put in a new cartridge. I'm sure the Epson folks would tell you that the ""right"" approach would be to always keep extra ($$$) cartridges on hand. Of course, the alternative is to buy a different brand."
1,Epson Techinical Support,"I am sending the Epson Stylus Photo 890 back. I could not make it work, I called Techinical Support which is a toll call,the lady I talked to was very rude, did not know how to help, called her superviser, they told me to call my camera company to get help. It was obvious that it was the printer that was at fault as it would not follow settings. I was very dissappointed. dkuhlmann@huntel.net"
5,Epson stylus photo 890 a must for home photo lab,"Brought this back in May at Amazon for [$] including shipping, this is the best deal for this type of quality. Much more quiet than the stylus photo 700 which I owned. I used Espon glossy photo paper, not the premium glossy, but just the glossy photo papers. The outcome is amazing, and once in a while I use the borderless printing option, and the picture is undistinguishable from a normal picture from the photo lab. Yet, all these wonderful prints are done at 720x1440, I didn't even use the 2880 dpi resolution yet. The color ink last about 18 prints of 8x10. At [$] each, it is actually very cheap compared to others. I tried to use 720x720 dpi on 4x6inch photo, and it looked like a professional processed photograph. So if you plan on print 4x6 size, then your color ink will last much much longer."
2,ZZZZZZZ,"Ordered this because of some distant childhood memory of seeing it on TV. The song, ""I'm Upside-down"" had been in my mind ever since and for years I had tried to track it down, not really knowing which version I had seen. When I finally found this, it did not live up to my memories. The tranfer was what I had expected: watchable, but old, soft-focus VHS quality. The film itself, though, was hard to get into becuse a good deal of time is spent at the beginning with Lewis Carroll (Dodson) and his University cronies. It seemed endless and by the time Alice finally fell down the rabbit hole, I had fallen asleep."
1,Had to stop playing it,"My main complaint is the audio is horrible. I had it turned up to a point where the TV would normally be deafening. I just could hear excessive tape noise (white noise) and very LOW volume of vocals. I'd describe it as sounds low movie volume, and blank tape noise as loud, if not louder then the vocals.Video is okay. Granted it is an older recording, the video is pretty good.If the project could have been remastered the video and audio could have been enhanced. However for the investment to take that on, it would be a financial loss.As much as I would like to see it in the entirety, I had to quit it in 15 minutes. I had better expectations then it showed."
1,"Should have been a classic, transfer quality is a problem",This should have been a classic film but suffered commercially because of the clash with the Disney version. This British film fan hadn't even heard of it until this year. If you are able to view Region 2 DVD's I would recommend the French version available on the French Amazon site. This has much beter picture and sound quality as it seems to have been taken from the film and not a video source. The French version had it's own script so it is not just a dubbed version of the English film.
4,Alice in Wonderland (1950),"I was completely blown away by this enchanting version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND. Carol Marsh's portrayal of the famous heroine is truly remarkable, capturing the innocence and curosity of such agirl. The combination of puppets and live-action is unbelievable,bringing the fun and surrealism of the original book to the screen. Well acted and laid out. A treat for the entire family!"
5,The High & The Mighty,Excellent music by London symphony. We used it during an airshow and it worked great! Very happy
2,Purchase at your own risk!!,"I'm not going to beat around the bush on this one...this recording is horrible! The sound quality is terrible. The chorus sounds slightly off at times and the orchestration is just plain odd! I've heard several recordings of Verdi's Requiem and this is hands down the worst. However, in all fairness to the performers, all the faults I've just mentioned might be due to the sound quality. The soloists are wonderful however, and I think if the recording could be remastered it might be wonderful.Price is in wonderful voice, as is Pavarotti. The bass has a wonderful timbre to his voice and the mezzo is lovely. It's just hard to get past the sound quality. It's almost like they recorded on stage and put the recording equipment out in the lobby! You have to turn it up very loudly to get the full scope of the piece, which in turn, distorts half of it. I would recommend buying another recording of these wonderful pieces."
4,Wish I had read it more - I might still be sane!!,"From inside cover - It's an outrageously funny, sensitive and ultimately caring and loving book for mothers who are determined to do right by their babies, and desperately guilty and anxious that they are getting it all wrong."
1,Don't Waste Your Time Or Money,"Don't waste your time or money on this book. Go with (Tai Chi Touchstones), or (Tai Chi Classics). When I first heard about this book I was mislead about the content. I didn't think it was anything more than the author taking the basic principles and writing small stories about them. You can find the basic principles like sinking the weight or relaxing in a hundred books about Tai Chi Go with the books I listed above if you really want to learn something about Tai Chi."
2,Not a very good book to read for technique,I thought that this book was nothing more than a attempt to make fun of Tai Chi. It was written as a reference for those people who like to bring things down to their level of thinking.
5,A fantastic read!,"Annie Sweetwater had been treated like a fragile porcelin doll for her entire life. Everyone saw her in terms of her physical limitations. But Luke Carpenter saw the woman no one else had ever looked for...a woman Annie didn't even see until she looked at herself through his eyes. With his love, she learns to trust herself, to see that life is full of endless possibilities, if only she can learn to stand on her own two feet, knowing that Luke will be there to lean on if she needs him.Every time Cheryl St. John has a new book out, I practically race for the bookstore. Her books are such sweet poignant tales of love, and they never fail to touch my heart. Sweet Annie was no exception...no, it was simply exceptional!"
4,"colorful, cynical & bitterly amusing",An amazing and captivateing book from start to finish. Brings you on Griffen's downward spiral with a realizem that is shatteringly horrific.
4,"The Prose of Micheal Herr's""DISPATCHES""novelized.","If dark humor""specialist"" Danny DeVito ever wanted to direct a VietNam genre ""M.A.S.H."" meets Kubrick's""FULL METAL JACKET"",this book would be the blueprint.The feverish prose picks up where Micheal Herr's""Dispatches""leaves off.Remember the 1st person narrative of Capt.Willard's character in""Apocalypse Now""(especially written for the film by Herr)? This writer takes you to that dark place where,if you're not armored with an acid sense of humor for the profoundly absurd,we would surely go mad."
3,"Good for references, but too polemical for my tastes.","The author has rounded up a lot of references in various areas of Islamic eschatology, and for this we owe him a debt of gratitude. However, it's not balanced, scholarly or objective, and sets out, not to compare the eschatologies of Christianity and Islam, but to prove an inherent deficiency in Islam vis-a-vis Christianity. Additionally, this book really could have used another round of editing, as grammatical and other mistakes are far more common than what I would expect from a scholarly text."
4,Interesting,"I watched this movie when I was in college years ago and decided to check it out again. Pretty cool stuff. The film is definitely biased in favor of graffiti and focuses only on San Francisco. It is kind of a shame most of the work is gone, but a stroll around the city always yields some new notable works and the all-to-prevalent tags which we all frown upon. This is a great film to watch once or twice if you're ever curious or happen to be living in or visiting the city."
5,Favorite Documentary!,"I bought this when I was in highschool, and I am totally glad that I did. Many of the pieces seen in this movie are extinct today. I think Nick did a great job documenting the history of graffiti in San Francisco. It hasn't been done in the past, and I'm glad he was the guy to do it. I would never neglect or abandon this dvd, I will most definitely let my kids or grandkids inherit this just so they know and understand the good, the bad, and the ugly of San Francisco graffiti history!"
2,a splendid cd for people who enjoy background swing music,"This is a fine cd to have on in the background, but bring it to the forefront and ther isn't much going on... Too bad this band has potential."
3,Slipped a little bit,"I am a great fan of Mr. Bond, however, I must admit that this book lacked the punch of some of his previous works. I started my Bond adventures with Red Phoenix, so I compare all to it. This time I draaaaaaaged through the first part of the booked bored, and uninterested. The plot as well as the characters seemed to be undeveloped. Although I only gave this book three stars, I'm devoted, and will be picking up his next book."
2,it sucked,"this book was a baltent attemp to copy the succes of red storm rising, and that is what caused its ultimate demise"
4,Before the Rainbow Nation....,"There was apartheid. An evil stain across the face of a great nation. As it started to crumble, Brown wrote about what might happen, if....It was actually rather nice, if not down-right gob-smackingly amazing - to find apopular U.S. author who specialises in techno-military-thrillers acknowledging that life does exist south of the Equator.Bond writes good stuff. This a great, galloping read. It proceeds at an enormous pace, like a grass fire across the veldt. Anyone who enjoys a story of sweat, blood, terror, and war... well, this one's for you. Enjoy."
5,his best book and most satisfying to date,the plotting is his best yet characters sem to be real the story is so fast paced I could not put it down! un-down putable!
4,Good mix of plot and character development.,"A lesser author could have easily skimped on plot to concentrate on characters or provided highly developed characters with a half-baked story. Mr. Bond did an excellent job of balancing the action with the private lives of the characters. And the number of these well developed characters is also impressive. Whether you like them or not, you definitely care what happens to the majority of the people ""onstage,"" even if they are minor players. The plot does move frustratingly slowly at times but all in all, it's hard to put down."
5,"""I Dreamed I Was Normal"" expands understanding of autism","As the teacher of 7 students with autism, I was facinated bythis book. The three charachers the music therapist focuses upon aredelightful. The writing changes all preconceived notions regarding autism and mental retardation, enabling the reader to understand and accept the clients as PEOPLE rather than ""retarded"". The ideas about reincarnation and autistic people requesting from God that they be autistic in this life are a bit far-fetched. However, the book will be very encouraging and soothing for the parents of autistic people to read. I recommend it for family members, teachers, care workers, etc. of people with autism."
3,gone but not forgotten,"I always felt Ray Sharkey was a terrific actor, his portrayal in this movie was incredible. The movie starts out as a great mystery, weaving in different characters to keep you from guessing who the ""Rain Killer"" actually is but peters out in the end with a ridiculous ending."
5,Amazing Story,"I have not read other books about this topic first. Therefore, I did not know the outcome of Shackleton's adventure. But I did learn of the endurance of the men on the otherside waiting for Shackleton. The book gives a very personal account of the men from the ship Aurora as they trek to leave supply stores for Shackleton's crossing of Antartica. It never ceases to amaze what human's can endure for exploration."
4,Learn the other side of the adventure,"A very good story, but not as riveting as Shackelton's tail. After reading about Shackelton's misadventure's, it's easy to wonder what happened to the other half of his plan. In this book, the author clearly and vividly lays out the rest of the story, of the struggles of the crew, the conflicts of command and egos, of the disasters that imperiled lives, and the eventual results. If you're new to polar exploration history, then read Shackelton as your first book. If you've already read that, then read this book."
5,A brilliant performance by Carol Burnett,"""The Tenth Month"" is a made-for-TV movie that surpasses anything that Carol Burnett has done. This is perhaps one of her most touching performances. What's sad is that this movie is so hard to find in mint condition. It isn't as much as a tear-jerker as it's meant to be but it certainly has its moments where your heart goes out for Dory (Burnett's tormented character) and her boyfriend (a wonderful British actor). I highly recommend this movie to any Burnett fan or anyone who is the parent of an adopted child or an adopted child. It's wonderful! 5/5 stars"
3,Nice - Enjoyable,"I enjoyed the book. However I was irritated by the erroneous referral to ""Global Warming."" It was not needed and by the time this edition of the book was issued the author should know that it was and is a SCAM."
5,My heart was pounding throughout the film - AWESOME!!,"The Danish reviewer neglected to mention the brilliant performance of Josh Brolin. The odd friendship between the two male stars is intriguing and Nolte is a bit creepy, as well. This was one of the few films to keep me in suspense until the very end. You might want to close your eyes, but don't!!"
4,Good Night Watch,"Europeans can really show us Americans a few things. This film had style and scares. Brolin and Nolte are great, but Ewan's brogue would burst through in some scenes. Great set design adds to a scary film."
4,NightWatch-Mark Phillip Stassen,"Nightwatch (1998) 100 minutes. A washed out college student takes on a part time job as nightwatchman in a cold and silent morgue whilst a sadistic serial killer is out to frame innocent (Mcgregor) The plot thickens as (Mcgegor) begins to suspect his devoted friend (Brolin) Action packed mayhem ,very interesting cinematography,spine chilling performances by Policeman (Nolte) Remember be on the lookout ! Mark Phillip Stassen."
4,LIKED IT ALOT!!!!,"I always hunger for suspense and mystery and horror movies that's my hobby ...from friend and good reviews in here, I bought this DVD ...WOW, really liked it, suspense and kind of scary. From head to toe,Cant believe this movie didn't doing good in movie theaters. But I am really glad got this DVD and movie is great...And enjoys it. Don't miss it, if u likes this kind of gender movies. Is a lots twist and kind of scary.. ""EWAN MCGREGOR"" played real good in this movie and he's kind of cute too , hehe.. Anyway dont miss it!!! Great thriller ride !!"
3,Nightwatch,"This dark and grisly tale is certainly not for the squeamish at heart. A young law student (Ewan McGregor), while working as a night watchman at the city morgue, finds himself the prime suspect in a series of gruesome murders. Nick Nolte stars as the detective assigned to the case and is certain that McGregor is the killer. The acting is exceptional for a hokey thriller like this (it actually takes itself much more seriously than most viewers will) and many scenes are actually quite creepy, but the story has a few holes and the plot twists are telegraphed a mile in advance. Director: Ole Bornedal. Cast: Ewan McGregor, Nick Nolte, Josh Brolin, Patricia Arquette, Brad Dourif. Rated R for violence, gore, profanity, and brief nudity. 105 minutes."
4,Great Thriller!,Enjoyed this movie very much after having not seen it for years! All the characters were great especially Ewan McGregor!
3,Post-modern creepy thriller!,"A redo of the danish version called ""Nattevagten"" directly translated : ""The nightwatch"". To me the movie is a scary thriller, with beautiful scenic pictures and a surrealistic touch - that adds xtra thrill. Especially Ewan McGregor does an execellent job, but also Patricia Arquette and Nick Nolte are good! What I missed literally was a few scenes that was removed from it - scenes that were in the danish version. But all in all it's a good solid movie that deserves being seen."
2,Another Example in an Execrable Trend,"Well, watch the original Danish version by the same director, now available with the director's comment on DVD, if you really want a scary and well-made psychothriller. Watch this one if you have extra time to kill, or cannot watch a movie with subtitles no matter what. The American remake certainly had a bigger budget and it shows, but all the elements that made the original such a quirky mixture of black humor and genuine thrills have been neutralized, not to mention the Danish local context, in which, for example, a gun makes no appearance until the climax of the climax. (Thereby making it more effective as a weapon) Josh Brolin gives a great performance, the only improvement over the original."
2,"ok,scary movie about a morgue attendent's nightmare!!","This movie is about a young college student who takes a night job at a morgue. After he does this job for a while , he is framed for murder!!Nobody believes of course. Nick nolte plays a man trying to solve the murders. The movie is fairly suspenseful , but the filmakers showed wgo the murderer was a little bit too early in the movie. of course i thought the end was a littlr bit too predictable!!Overally a ok movie for a rental !Why is this not out on DVD yet!!!It would be better if was in widescreen!!"
2,ATMOSPHERIC!,"This movie touches on most peoples innate fears. The idea of sitting in a town morgue at night alone is unsettling to most. This film works because it uses my aforementioned statement and mixes it with a murder mystery/shock tale. The movie uses quietness and surprise in a frightening way. I felt their were a few unnesscesary scenes pertaining to Ewan McGregors' friend. The unstable adolecent act was overdone and added a false hipness to the film. Nick Nolte put some nice touches on his role. The overall foreboding feel of the movie worked.I would really give this movie 2 and a half stars. The dvd quality is ok, but a special edition is needed."
2,"ignore this, see the original instead","My theory is that Ole Bornedal, whose 1994 Danish-language original ""Nattevagten"" was an instant classic of the serial-killer/suspense genre, was shown a large sum of $$$ to force out this turgid, soulless remake. It's almost a shot-by-shot, line-by-line retelling of the familiar 'whodunit' with a law student (the uncomfortable Ewan McGregor) being menaced by a serial killer during his nightwatch at a medical building. The character shading, smooth flow of events, and atmospheric chills have been replaced at the expense of visual finesse and inexplicable character motivation. Style over substance, much in the vein of those melarkey ""Scream"" films, and more than likely to snare in the kiddies.My two-star rating is based solely on the stylish re-creations of a few scenes, plus admirable performances from Nick Nolte and Josh Brolin, who give the dense material their all. But my advice is to avoid this version altogether and stick with the real deal."
2,Disappointed.,"You can see that this director is very talented. He has a very good sense of the language of the camera and creates some good suspense. But the script just died. It was obviously manipulative and dare I say ""Scream-like"". Killer kills, people are made ambiguously suspect, killer is revealed, killer is an arbitrary character."
1,It's too bad that the the 1/2 star rating isn't available!,"I'm generally easy to please in the motion picture department. I'm as happy in a cheesy action film as I am in an artistic film. The reason being is that I am capable of suspending disbelief and turning off my brain or vice versa depending on the situation. But I just couldn't do it with this one! It was too farfetched, dull, and dwelled more on cheap psychological tactics rather then good film making. If you are in the market for a good scare, I'd suggest Jacobs Ladder or The Exorcist, which are both frightening films. And in the suspense department, I'd recommend The Usual Suspects. I would not recommend this clunker."
2,Disapointed.,"I first watched the original when it got out 5 or so years ago. And I though it more than excellent. Truly creepy, spooky and intriguing. So I obviously had high expectations for the big budget remake even though being a little skeptic. My skepticism was justified. Besides from being highly tuned down in all regards, they had also complete lost the essence of evil which is what made it so spooky in the first place. The acting wasn't all bad(Thus two stars instead of 1) but not spectacular either.Really, they should never have made this. And I don't see how it could have gone this wrong....If however, the unlikely happen, and you like this movie, you really ought to see the original(dubbed/subbed/whatever) version."
4,PURE FUN,"Pointer Sisters as shown here prove what they do best: Interpret cool, sometimes corny, pop songs only as these three sisters can. All songs here are danceable...even more so in their extended versions. The singing is top notch...including some great harmonies (""Fire"" comes to mind) and enough sass thrown in for good measure. Buy this if your looking to forget your troubles for an hour :)"
4,Pointers almost perfect,"Great music from the Pointer Sisters, but missing some of their best. Where was ""I Know A Place""? They are great."
4,Great makeout music,"My boyfriend and I, like, totally macked out to this album last night. I can barely wait to hear it again. From now on, whenever I hear the words ""neutron dance"" I will think about gettin' jiggy wit' it."
1,"Amazon, stop selling this cd","The worst cd ever. No file content and the sound is horrible. Buy the Best of The Pointer Sisters instead. Shame on you, Amazon. Mark"
2,good singers weak material,the Pointer Sisters are solid singers but the material is first class Vegas Lounge after hours.catchy annoying lyrics with no meaning.the kind of stuff that is played on the radio and you are puzzled how it ever blew up.you wanna respect them because the vocals are good but the songs most of them are super cheessy.
4,"Full length songs, missing a few tracks","It's a great CD for your collection is you want the full version of songs like ""Automatic"", ""Jump for My Love"", and ""Dare Me"". That's the benefit of this compilation.The shortcoming is that this collection leaves out several of the Pointer Sisters hits, like ""Goldmine"", and earlier hits like ""Yes We Can Can"" and ""Could I Be Dreamin'"". Those songs appear on ""Best of the Pointer Sisters (RCA Box)"" and ""The Very Best of the Pointer Sisters: Fire""."
4,We like it,"Good portion size (7.5 oz), not too carb-heavy for a diabetic, reasonable nutritional value, just enough to satisfy hunger when paired with a small sandwich for lunch. Good amount of meat, gravy is a little blah but it's canned food, really. Good price bought in bulk online. Glad it comes in this size, would say that it's part of a good cold-day-take-to-work meal."
3,I expected SO much more.,"After discovering Ray quite late, just a couple months ago, I was blown away by his songwriting and, probably moreso, how absolutely genuine the guy is. After seeing a couple live performances via YouTube, I was expecting a lot more from this Bonnaroo performance. I played the CD a single time and can't bring myself to listen again- it was that bad, IMO. Maybe he was ill or the room just wasn't any good, but it sounds like the guy couldn't even hear himself sing."
4,rayok,"The very first time I heard Ray, I was channel surfing and came across a concert of his being broadcast on PBS. His voice blew me away.I don't think this is Ray putting out a live release. More like the folks at Bonnaroo capitalizing on the success of Trouble (since it is not under RCA - Rays label).He's not the Allman Bros., but it is still worthwhile to hear him live."
2,Do you trust your broker's advice?,"For the individual investor, I would give this book a single star. I should have seen the warning signs ... ""Bloomberg Professional Library"" and the author's ""views are widely quoted in the financial press."" Brokers may find this volume useful in providing market timing and trading strategies that their customers are expecting.The author targets only subjective and qualitative ""insights"", with very little data and no statistical analysis. If the author's job title of ""quantitative strategist"" is to be taken seriously, we would expect some supporting evidence (ie returns data) that the strategies produce results. Show us the yachts.If you are looking for a quantatative discussion of analysis and models, look elsewhere. Insights in this book impress me as purest hand-waving, and the text is loaded with equivocation, suggestion and speculation."
2,Shoddy Scholarship,"I read only four pages of this book in a bookstore before I realized that Weir is not to be trusted. For the section on Elizabeth's 1575 progress visit to Kenilworth, Weir took almost all her information directly from Robert Laneham's eyewitness letter describing the event. Despite the fact that she follows his narrative almost exactly, she gets several pieces of information wrong, including the dates. She states Elizabeth stayed ten days when it was actually nineteen. Obviously these details aren't important in themselves, but I have to wonder: if Weir makes such errors when she's just copying off of a well-known and widely-available document, how careful is her scholarship?"
1,A book for the intellectually challenged. Very Disappointing,"Now I understand why the reviews printed on the cover of this book are reviews of the author's past books. Quite frankly, there is not much to be said about this work of gossip. This book is a shameful excuse for a history book. People who enjoy tabloid magazines and filth; the type that focused on Lady Diana's dates, affairs, and tennis partners will enjoy this book immensely. It seems to me the author spent a great deal of time tracking down gossip and rumors related to Elizabeth. If you are an avid biography reader or history buff, this book is guaranteed to disappoint you. I couldn't wait to finish it, and hoped that the author would finally bring in some substance into this work. That does not happen. Don't waste your time on this one. Try Carolly Erickson's Book, The Frist Elizabeth instead, or any other book for that matter!"
2,Mostly historical rubbish.,This is a sweet attempt to tell a somewhat romantic story of Elizabeth 1. For those interested in English history they might want to read 'Character's of the Reformation' by Hillaire Belloc. This English historian deals with the political side of the Tudor monarchy and the men who actually gave Elizabeth her marching orders and who ran the government during her reign.
2,The Life of Elizabeth I,"Overall a good book, but someone with the experience and research time invested that Allison Weir has should know that Elizabeth I was the wife of Henry Tudor, the first in the Tudor line and by some number of degrees this Elizabeth's great grandmother. This is actually a book about Elizabeth II."
3,Interesting but dry at times,"Weir does a great job of giving the flavor of the times and the Virgin Queen. However, she gets bogged down in too much detail sometimes. There are hidden bits of humor that are fun to find, as well.Overall I believe this is a good biography of the Queen, however, it isn't for those looking for a quick or simple read."
3,By virtue of one chapter...,"...this biography earns its place. From the onset, Weir admits that her original aim to write of the private Elizabeth was a goal she could not realize; it is virtually impossible to extricate the woman from the monarch, when all she touched reverberated throughout England and Europe. Which leaves us with a biography much in the mold of others. What sets this one apart? Maybe only this: Weir is the first in my experience to truly explore the death of Amy Robsart, Elizabeth's beloved Leicester's wife. Her careful examination of that most bizarre scenario makes her book a valuable read for the Tudor aficionado. Beyond this, we find much that has been said often before. But the insights are valid, if not fresh; the scholarship is strong, if not novel; and the tone is correctly balanced, if not overly compelling. It is no disparagement to the author to say that hers is a highly competent, if unexciting, addition to the many shelves devoted to that amazing princess, Elizabeth."
4,Good account of Elizabeth's life,"This is thorough examination of a great woman's life, but more from the perspective of her personal life than of great political feats and military battles. I have read much about Elizabeth I and enjoy both true histories and historical fiction. For a marvelous fictional account of her life, I highly recommend ""Legacy"" by Sharon Kaye. I believe that novel rather than any biography, movie, or any other fictional account truly captures the essence of Elizabeth as a woman and a queen. That book made me feel I could really understand her motivations and made me want to meet her."
5,Historical Read,"I am an Elizabethan freak so it takes a lot for me to really get into a book about the period and not nit pick it. This book follows Elizabeth across her life. I didn't think it offered much of a new perspective or new data however. It was a pretty standard biography of her (I've read about 10), but Alison Weir is a good writer which makes it enjoyable. If you are looking for new facts or a more thought provoking read, I would suggest David Starkey's Elizabeth. It explores her youth more and discusses many of the possible theories of a pregnancy, dispells tower gossip stories based on scientifc records from the time period, and is also an enjoyable read. So if you want something a little mindless and entertaining, or if you are new to this field of study, this is a good book. If you're a little more seasoned, I would choose the Starkey book and if you can afford both, I would suggest that so you can compare and contrast."
4,Fond portrait...,"Though this reads at times like a college textbook, it is thorough and intelligent, brings light to personality and the choices made throughout her reign. Not only does Weir introduce the internal workings of the throne, but also the society without, its culture and changes. When you are done reading this, not only will you know everything about the Golden Age of England and its Queen, but you will love them both."
5,This is a great book!,"Throughout the entire process of reading this book, I was completely enthralled. The information was, in my opinion, stated in such a way that the reader could not help but be transfixed. Alison Weir has done an excellent and thorough job of articulating the many events of Elizabeth's life, and her book is very well researched. I was surprised when I watched the movie of Elizabeth I, because it wrongly portrayed Elizabeth. Alison Weir's neutral portrayal not only was more interesting, but also presented the facts about her reign but allowed the reader to come to his/her own conclusion about what is going on. You're allowed to have your own opinion without the author throwing stuff in your face. I also read THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY VIII and that also was a great book. Keep up the good work, Ms. Weir!!"
4,"Great, but not as captivating as other Weir books","Of the books I have read by Weir (Six Wives of Henry VIII, Children of Henry VIII, The Lady Elizabeth), all have been immensely fascinating and educational. While this biography painted an informative portrait of the Virgin Queen, at times it lacked the touch that Weir posseses to transform her subjects from names on a page to the living, breathing people they once were. For example, the latter half of the book, focusing on the trials and tribulations of an older Elizabeth's favorite, Essex, felt like a string of events simply laid on paper - something any mediocre grad student could churn out.Having finished the book, I am glad to have expanded my knowledge on the reign of Elizabeth I, but feel I did not come away as enlightened as I did after Weir's novel, The Lady Elizabeth. If you want to know Elizabeth on a deeper level and learn about her life before her coronation, read The Lady Elizabeth."
1,"Too much love, not enough genius.",I found the bio to focus too much on Elizabeth's love life (and lack thereof) and not enough on her particular political genius (which I was more interested in finding out more about). I did not finish the book.
1,Tedious and impersonal.,"After seeing the movie about Elizabeth I was left thirsty for more information about this facinating historical figure, so I went looking for a Book. I wanted something that read like an interesting novel, not tedious lists of family trees and impersonal second hand accounts of what was speculated about this woman and her reign. I'm sure it is well researched and accurate in it's content but I was left falling asleep each night while I trudged through it."
3,Don't let the 116 reviews be the reason you buy this book,I am reading this book after having read several others on the tudors. If you are interested in a very opinionated and dry take on the life of Elizabeth I--then this book is for you.Lots of Weir's opinions but the content isn't any different than anything Ive read already.
5,elizabeth,i think the book was exellent i think it was better then the movie i know some people won't agree with meABOUT that but that was my opion.
3,"Interesting information, but poorly organized","I am not an Elizabethan scholar, nor do I wish to have to read through excessively academic writings to learn about Elizabeth I and her court. I think this book was intended for people like me. However, the book is poorly organized and as a result, a handful of themes and ideas are repeated and batted around in almost every chapter, and the chronology is all over the place. If Ms. Weir didn't repeat herself so often, the book would be about two-thirds the size. Perhaps her publisher paid by the pound..."
2,Readable But Disappointing #2,"I agree with Readable but Disappointing #1 the entire book could fairly be summarized as ""Elizabeth flirted endlessly with many men, realizing that her marriage, offspring, and choice of successor were her most prized (and only) major assets."" The amorous intrigue for her hand goes on and on and on and ... you get the idea. As interesting as it starts out, at a certain moment it just seems pointless. She played the same game for decades -- do we really need to know every twist and turn? Perhaps more disappointingly for me, since I really bought my first Elizabeth book to learn about her, I found myself wondering if this woman ever signed a bill, proposed something to Parliament, plotted state strategy with her advisors. This book could more accurately be titled ""The Personal Life & Interminable Marriage Intrigues of Elizabeth I and Her Court."""
3,Very interesting biography of a great Queen,"I enjoyed reading this book, it offered such interesting insights into the Court of Elizabeth I and her period that it was hard to put down. At times I wanted less detail of her personal life and more on what was happening in Europe and England but I suppose that was what the book was all about anyhow. This is a very well told piece of history which I think comes close to being as good as Antonia Fraser's book 'Mary Queen of Scots'. Although I think Elizabeth had more to do with Mary Queen of Scots execution than this author would like to say. (My Scottish bias maybe!). A great story, and just in time for the current movie which is also excellent."
4,Elizabeth came alive.,"Alison Weir makes you feel like you were there and saw all of this happenning. Elizabeth is a complex person, not the perfect queen you get in history books. I liked Elizabeth, hated her, and finally ended up admiring her for who she is - s very real person who had to balance her personal ambitions with the limitations put on women in her society.The only downside here is that the Elizabeth book is a lot drier than the books about Henry the VIII's wives and children."
4,Elizabeth I - Alive and Well,"Weir does not approach her subject as an academician. This isn't to say that the information within her book is inaccurate, or not backed by extensive research. Rather, Weir is more intent on establishing Elizabeth as a person, rather than a historical relic. Her attempt is to fill Elizabeth with flesh and blood. And this she succeeds at, beautifully.I'm sure that there are more academically detailed analysis of Elizabeth I, but I doubt there are any more human."
1,Masking political achievements with the marriage debate,"The book provided interesting insight into the Life of the Queen famous for her positive impact on her country. I found that the author seemed to be trying to make her into an early feminist however. Endless pages were devoted to her string of marriage negotiations. This apparently left little room to discuss her major accomplishments. Multiple chapters focused on her ongoing relationships with Leceister and Essex, yet there was only one brief chapter on the Armada. Overall only about 3 of the 26 chapters dwells on her actual foreign or domestic policies, with the others largely dwelling on courtroom romp. I was very disappointed."
5,All hail the Queen,Absolutely fantastic book. Explains in detail about the life and times of Elizabeth I. Any Tudor fan must have
4,Super Quick Service!,The book was in great condition for the price! I would totally buy from this seller again!
5,Great Book...Must Read,"No, I am not an expert on British history, but Weir's narration is well written, easy to read, yet challenges the intellect enough to keep you interested. I enjoyed the scope of the book and feel that my understanding of this incredible woman has been greatly enlarged. It is simply an enjoyable book and the intrigues between Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots really kept the book moving along. I can't wait to read Weir's next book about the murder of Lord Darnley. ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII"" is the perfect predecessor to this book. Well done, Alison!"
4,England's Most Endearing Monarch,"Another great book by Alison Weir, but the first half of the book should be renamed ""A Husband for Elizabeth."" As in Elizabeth I's life, the first part of the book deals with whether or not she will marry and the prospects of who would be her husband. Alison Weir does give the reader a lot of information, but the book is pretty easy to follow. It was not only facinating to read about how and why she ruled the way she did, but also the clothes that made that era truly ""Elizabethan."" Having already read Mary, Queen of Scots, I appreciated reading Elizabeth's point of view regarding the whole ""Mary Situation."" A nicely written book to take the reader through the life of Elizabeth I. As with Alison Weir's other books, this one contains wonderful portraits of all of the players involved in her life as well as a geneology table to keep them sorted out."
2,Elizabeth Goes A' Courting,"Perhaps this book is a good starting point for those of us who are beginning an interest in Elizabeth, however, I was bored by the hundreds of pages detailing Elizabeth's suitors and marriage proposals. Thankfully, this book is based in enough fact that I knew the movie was inaccurate. I would not recommend this book to anyone who is interested in anything other than the goings on of Elizabeth's court"
3,Mediocre Book of Elizabeth TUDOR,"This is one of the more mediocre books by Weir, it's poorly organized and not at all as lavish and interesting as she usually writes. A better bet would be THE CHILDREN OF HENRY VIII, speaks of Elizabeth, too...not to mention my favorite Tudor, Jane Grey."
3,The Life of Elizabeth I,"Alison Weir, a very successful popular historian, has written an absorbing biography of the ever popular Elizabeth I. However, serious students of history should beware. The author makes only cursory attempts to be even handed in her analysis of this controversial queen. Colorful, mercurial, brilliant are all apt descriptions of Elizabeth, but if you're Irish or Catholic, you might use other adjectives. Ms. Weir pretty much dismisses those other unmentionable attributes with a hohum, let's get on with more Eliza worship. I'd like to see a more balanced, critical picture of this Tudor monarch."
3,OK but......,"While I recognize that her neverending courtships, both for politics and her own vanity are important, I do feel that this subject dominated the book. Of course Dudley and especially Essex reflect her faults. The book does not focus on many other very important aspects of her reign. It seems to want to be a ""love story"" as opposed to a complete biography. I did find it to be ""easy reading"" for a book of this kind but I must recommend Anne Somerset's biography for a more well rounded and informed view."
4,its a good one,well its a good software as far as the rendering is concerned its better then bryce and light effects are good camera handeling is ok.transforming the images in to heave texturized maps is superb.awesome software.but above all its ik is the best i have ever seen in any other 3d software other than hig ones i guess.
5,Wonderful Daily Meditations,This is a perfect book for anyone who wants a quick but richly beautiful daily meditation. St. Therese of Lisieux never fails to take you deeper in your relationship with Jesus through her little way.
3,feel the lack of something..,"To my opinion, the merit of this book is that it gives good basic knowledge about assembler and loader. Especially, the chapter about loader is very clearly written. I think that it's better than Levin's book (Linkers and Loaders).However, the level of information is too low. If you are under-graduate student and don't have many experience about the assembly programming, this book is helpful to raise your level in system programming. But to experienced engineer, I think it will be a disappointing book.I'd like to recommend this book as the introductory book or the summary of assembler, link and loader, compiler, os, software engineering, and so forth."
4,A good introduction to Systems Programming,"This book, while old, is a good introduction to the SIC/XE assembler. I used it as a reference for my Systems Software class, and it looks like i'll be able to get some use out of it when I take my compiler class as well. I must say, the book could use more reference on how to assemble complete instructions, our professor went over this in class but I found myself wishing that the text had more information on it. All in all not a bad textbook!"
5,fine,"the product worked, but this review scenario is crap I do not like that I am forced to write 20 meaningless words when the simple statement fine would suffice"
1,"Funny? No, Dreary","I picked up Mike Magnuson's book looking for some laughs, and page by page I found myself getting more and more depressed. If it's autobiographical as it claims, I'm really sorry for the guy. I had hoped it might be funny in a Dave Barry, Garrison Keillor or Robert Kirby kind of way. There's just no funny there...."
1,You think you're a writer??,Let me tell you---I am from Eau Claire and know a lot of the characters in the book----He's got it all wrong. Ask Anyone
2,Forget it,"So, this is where the Miller Beer ads appropriated their writing style! If you like those ads, this is the book for you. Just imagine 5 hours of that narrator talking, and you get the idea."
1,Why re-print a Great Book with a New Title?,"This is a great book but is word for word, page for page identical with Anna's 1994 ""Fancy Feet: Traditional Knitting Patterns of Turkey"". I was very excited to order a new sock book by AZ, but this is not new... If you don't have ""Fancy Feet"" and like colored knitting or sock knitting, it's a great work otherwise, skip the annoyance of buying a book that you already own."
2,Fun - But Limited,"This book offers some wonderful traditional Turkish socks. Incredibly colorful and interesting, but not something you would wear every day. I've found that I made one pair of socks out of this book (as a gift) - but I haven't made any others.I may consider using these socks as Christmas Stocking Socks."
4,Great water shoes - sizing runs small,"I bought these shoes for my 10 year old who wears a size 1 shoe. These water shoes were way too small for her foot. However, on the positive side, the shoes L(1-2) fit my 7 year old who wears a kids size 12. As for quality, they are excellent!"
5,nice shoes,"These are the most comfertable granny boots I have. While they are high, the bottom of the shoe has a really nice grip so I don't feel like I'm gonna slide across the room like I do with alot of high heeled boots. They're nice and stable, but still pretty to look at."
3,50/50,"This is very simple: Symphony in X Major is a sick song. Choke Me, Spank Me, Pull My Hair is a terrible song. my suggestion? Buy the CD. You'll put up with Choke me and about 2 other crappy songs, and get a great CD otherwise"
3,Caveat Emptor,"Fresh Sound records has rescued some valuable music from oblivion, but this collection is too much of a mixed bag to serve as a jewel in the reissuer's crown. The first 3 tunes are selections from the 5-LP set recorded as Shelly Manne and His Men, ""Live at the Blackhawk."" A fine example of straight-ahead West Coast hard bop though not, in my estimate, the best example of Joe Gordon's work after his move to the West Coast. The bass player on these first 3 tracks (of the 5) is Monty Budwig. Some of us might consider the title--Joe Gordon and Scott Lafaro--just a little, if not flagrantly, misleading.I see why the reviewer at ""All Music Guide"" was puzzled by the 4th tune--""It Could Happen to You."" It's NOT that Jimmy Van Heusen tune. Instead it's a tune apparently before the reviewer's time (not mine, though, since we frequently called it on sessions). it's ""Paul's Pal,"" which is, I believe, a Sonny Rollins' composition."
4,Great picture book for lighthouse lovers,"Bruce Roberts may be the best lighthouse photographer working in America. Any of the books by him and his partner Ray Jones are well worth owning. They include great lighthouse photos, a little story from Jones about each one and directions as to how to get to them. The lighthouse lover could scarcely ask for more."
1,Photos of the Sample Pages Provided,"Quality of photos was very poor. I want to see details of the various lighthouse not photos of the sky, trees or water. Photos of dark shaded lighthouse against a dark background on a very clouded day does not make for good photography. I have seen better pictures on the internet."
4,Gil's Finest Hour,"This CD is hot! There is not one bad song, no wasted moments, great production, and excellent rhythm section chemistry and tone. This can be found--although I got mine in Brazil--so keep on looking!"
1,I am going to rate philips pronto's in general,"I had the 2000. It's going in the garbage today. When I first got it 2 yrs ago, there was a defect and philips gave me a replacement, but a refurbished one. I argued to no avail with them. Two years later, this refurbished almost caused a fire. I smelled something melting just before going to bed, it was the pronto in the charger. My friend also had two of them break under normal uasage. They are pooly built and I don't think a company should replace a one week old unit with a used one.From a usage note. I found the lack of a tactile input a little hard to use.I would hope the new units are 'fire proofed' but I doubt the company policy has changed. I won't be buying any philips products."
5,Extremely satisfied,Astounded at the value of this product. Top notch product and retailer! Received mine in Alabama in 5 days. Nothing cheap about it! Very pleased.
1,bait and switch,"shipping charges were double as advertised. ZERO customer service!!! I have print out of original order with correct shipping charges. Very upset with this type of activity going on on Amazon.com, will have to reconsider using Amazon.com again, WILL NEVER USE THESE ""PEOPLE"" AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great Guide,This book is a fabulous guide for anyone starting a business. Ms. Williams encourages and guides the new designer to be who he/she wants to be without letting fear stand in his/her way. She also give fabulous advice of do's and don'ts based on her personal experiences. I think this is a book worth reading.
2,bad disc made for unhappy gift,"i gave this as a gift, but it turns out that the transporter disc would not read 3 chapters. the transporter 2 disc worked fine."
2,A REALLY CHEESY cross between James Bond and an action hero movie,"Was pretty bored by the middle. He's easy on the eyes, and the driving scenes were cool, but that's about it. I got the 2 disc set and have no desire to see the 2nd one."
5,A good bundle,"I would recommend this bundle if you're a fan of the series. Disc 1 has the Transporter 1 as well as extra content with behind the scenes, where as Disc 2 is Transporter 2 alone."
3,Transporter collection 1&2,"Good video, audio quality. No bonus features on T-2. Offered for sale and purchased 2 weeks before the release in theaters of Transporter 3. I would have prefered to wait and get a collection of all 3 Transporter movies."
3,not convient for me without chinese subtitles,"it takes time to watch this film without chinese subtitles,but maybe I miss the describtion of the dvd, not at all"
2,Comes apart to easily!,If you are looking for a ship that the pieces stay on after you put it together this is not it. We got this ship for my son for Christmas and we are very disappointed. All of the good reviews are misleading. This ship takes about an hour to put together but the sails come off easily and so do many of the parts. This would be a great creative toy but your child is too busy trying to make it look like a pirate ship and keep the pieces on the ship. Needless to say we are in search of something more sturdy. Too bad bacause it is such a great looking ship!
4,Pirate ship entertains 4YO Boy,"My 4YO was very excited to put this together. It takes a night of an adult and the child to put it together. He plays with it a lot. I wish it weren't so easy to take it apart, since my kids keep taking the masts off and the sales. Other characters get to ride the ship and the accessories with people make for more pretend voyages."
4,great product and price,The fan assembly fit like a glove in my Acura rsx. The only negative was it took 3weeks to ship when I purchased it from amazon.
5,Fantastic book,Really a nice and beautiful book on how to make a bow... very good and clear instructions.. I like it a lot and would recommend it for anyone who wants to make his own bow.
3,Noisy!,"I bought this for my baby granddaughter, thinking it would be just right. All I had to do was pick it up to find out how noisy it is. I gave it to a 5 year old instead."
5,A gentle parable with an important life lesson,"Mole And The Baby Bird is the color picture book story of a mole who finds a young wild creature in need and tries his best to look after it. But wild creatures are not pets, and soon Mole must accept that the bird he sheltered can't stay with him forever. Written by Marjorie Newman and illustrated by Patrick Benson is highly recommended as a gentle parable with an important life lesson for young readers."
4,good,"I received my order in great time,before the Christmas holiday, was pleased with the ease of how to process the order, and the look of the product was even better than the picture. Thank you and we will do business again. Travis Evins"
5,So pretty...,This is just beautiful. I leave it on my island and use it as fruit and/or vegetable dish. It closely measures a tray I have and the two of them look wonderful in my kitchen.
3,Very Small and Cheap,"The concept of this toy is great, but the pieces are very small and somewhat hard to work with- especially for a younger child. The metal pieces arrive in the box with 2 sheets of stickers that need to be stuck on each little magnet piece. This annoyed me from the get-go because I just didn't feel like dealing with it. Overall this toy could be fun for older children and adults alike, but it's a definite choking hazard for if there are small children in the home and it looks pretty cheap."
2,A Horribly Written Book,"I have a great love for the art of landscape architecture and I am an artist with a talent for landscape design. As such, I am pursuing a degree in landscape architecture. This was a required book for one of my classes.My professor was one of the authors of this book. It is with regret that I must admit that someone with a doctorates, teaching at one the countries most prestigious universities with one of the highest rated programs by ASLA, has such poor writing skills. Even for me, as a person with great love for history and landscapes, I often found my attention wandering. In my opinion, the information was poorly organized and it was a very dull read.With the exception of this volume of work, I have kept every one of my text books as references in my career and have collected many others in my library. This one went in the trash as soon as I no longer had need for it.Don't buy this book unless you have to."
3,Nice relaxing read,I picked this book up at random while in Indonesia and just looking for anything in English. I was pleasantly surprised as it painted a vivid story and held my attention. I'd be interested in more of this author's novels.
4,A great dictionary for practical use of English,"Dictionaries are one of the most widely available, but under utilised resources English teachers and students have. Jon Wright's book sets out to rectify that. It is full of practical classroom uses for dictionaries. In fact, there are 98 different exercises with extensions to many. It has techniques for using dictionaries as a learning resource for pronunciation, spelling, vocabulary, reading skills and more. The exercises are photocopiable and so teacher friendly. Although example texts are given in the latter part of the book the exercises are easily adaptable to any texts that appeal to your students. I use this book more often than any other single ELT resource book. I highly recommend it to ELT teachers."
4,4 CD's in one case!,"Like the 3 CD/DVD cases I have reviewed, these really fill the bill for those mult-LP or multi-cassette compilation conversions to CD. One caution: The spindle retainers are very stiff, so it is very difficult to put the discs on or take them off the first few times. But once they have been used a couple times, then the tension to hold the disc is very good. I'm glad I found these as I had multi-LP compilations that these cases made possible to carry all in one unit."
5,The best new rock album you can buy today,"Tesla was always one of my favorite bands from the late 80s early 90s era, and I was always disappointed that they kind of dropped under the radar after hair metal died. They were way more sophisticated than most of the bands they were compared to like Cinderella, Warrant, or even Bon Jovi and Def Leppard. I always figured I would never hear another new Tesla tune until I stumbled across this CD, and I've got to say it's the best, purest rock album I've heard in years! They're still better than their contemporaries, and put Audioslave and Velvet Revolver to shame. No need to break down the songs - every one is great. Here's hoping the tour is coming soon!"
3,Solid but slow,"Loyal fans won't be disappointed but none of the songs have a good hard hook that would get you out of your seat at a concert. The songs are good to hear at home but I can picture concert-goers heading to the bathroom if most of these songs made the tour playlist. The last track is a great ballad. The rest fall somewhere in between hard and soft.The album is about as good as Bust a Nut. It doesn't grab you right away but it grows on you over time. After waiting 10 years, I was hoping Tesla would have a least one catchy new tune."
2,Boring...Into the why?,"I""ll admit i was excited hearing that tesla was coming back with an album.But as i thought about it i thought how the music scene has drastically changed since then and wondered if they would still fit in.Well i was right,they don't anymore,it seems they have tryed to hard to fit in with the likes of Default,Godsmack,Stained etc.Thats not the tesla i know and love,this album is nothing i repeat NOTHING like the first 2 which were the best in my opinion.The good ole days are gone,so i wish bands like this would just lay it to rest and retire and keep they're diginity(like Metallica should do also).Football players retire,Boxers retire,Poloticians retire,why not musicians??Two best tracks.....Into the Now..and Heaven."
5,Hard Rock album of the year! Period!,True Tesla fans MUST own or you're not a true fan. True Hard Rock fans MUST own or you're not a true fan. OWN THIS! 'Nuff said!
3,is this really Tesla?,"this is really a heavy album-I remembered Tesla as a hard blues rock band with good solos and hooks that reminded LedZepI was surprised by Intothenow-while it's good to see a real rock band continue to publish new material in these sad days for rock music, I was disappointed by the lack of melodies, real solos and by the almost metal style of the new songs. Perhaps this will grow on me. I liked the mightymouse song though, that reminded me of the old TeslaFor a great recent release by real rock band check out Megadeth"
4,Welcome back Tesla !!,"Tesla to me has always been a great rock.They have their own great sound and most always put out a solid effort.Their new cd ""Into the Now"",is another chapter in the history of great Tesla albums.While a good part of the cd is some of the hardest Tesla ever,the band does stick to their roots on such songs as ""Come to me"",an upbeat accoustic song that screams old school Tesla.Meanwhile songs such as the first track ""Into the Now"",feature some of the hardest guitars ever heard on a Tesla cd.While I do agree with a previous reviewer that none of the songs really reach out and grab you(at least chorus wise),the reviewer who said this was Godsmack with Jeff Keith on vocals,needs to listen to more Godsmack or get off whatever drugs he is on!There is not a Tesla song or a Godsmack song that sound anything alike.Besides Tesla are much more talented than Godsmack could dream of being!"
4,"Solid, enjoyable record","The songs are good, the Tesla sound is there, I'm glad that they are still putting out good music unlike some bands that started in the eighties. I would say this is not quite as good as some of their records from their heyday."
3,Un Inspired,"Tesla was one of my fav's back in the day. I saw them right after Tommy was booted out in 1996 on the Greatest Hits tour. I thought Bust a Nust was one of the best cd's of the 1990's, and by far their best. When they broke up, I thought about how all of their solo stuff would come out, and then eventually we would get a reunion. Sure enough we do, but this seems contrived. Its almost as if this band got together in the studio, and brought along a how to set of rules to make a safe album. This contains no inspiring riffs, no great single, and no great anthem that we are used to getting. There are no songs on this that you put on and feel good about listening to. Like a previous reviewer said, its not bad. Don't get me wrong. It is a lot better than any creed cd, or any of the nu rock bands. But from where they have been, this is a far cry."
5,they still rock,"I loved the old tesla and was very anxiouse to here the new album when i heard it was coming out. to be honest i didn't expect much but when i heard the 1st song(into the now) i was really impressed and new it would be one of my favorite cds.I have to say my favorite song on cd is miles away,with caught in a dream in a close 2nd."
4,Tesla: new and improved,Tesla returns rockin' as hard as ever but with a new modern flavor. If you ever even remotely like Tesla you will enjoy this album!
4,Final touches to great band,"For me, this ablum summed up all that was still in this band. That they still had something to say and wanted it be the ""Tesla"" way. They did a great job on this ablum and so this being their last album, I would want it my collection to show all the greatness they had to offer us!!"
4,80's revisited,"I was nervous to see another band of the 80's was releasing a new cd, but at the same time excited to purchase. I was relieved to hear that a group is still capable of playing good R&R while maintaining their roots. There is not one outstanding song on this cd but decent offerings throughtout, although one who listens to Tesla must realize that the musicianship is what brings this group to the forefront and my is it brilliant on this cd. Anyone who is a fan the the 80's rock genre must pick up this cd."
5,Pretty Damn Good,"A lifelong Tesla fan who grew up in the 70's and rocked hard in the 80's - 90's, I was very nervous about this release. Recent poor efforts like Queensryche have soured me on the great older bands. My fears were put to rest. This CD is very good. Not thier very best effort, (I like ""Psychotic Supper"" for personal reasons) but still very good. I have listened to this CD 18 out of the first 21 days I owned it.The first three songs come out with a different theme/hook but all of them are listenable, memorable and grab you. The song ""Caught up in a dream"" is terrific, as are ""Miles Away"", and ""Recognize"". Like a few other reviewers here the song ""Mighty Mouse"" just didn't work for me. I wish the band had put a very hard rocker here instead to round out the CD. Still, it is worth the money, well written, well done, and the reviewer who said the lyrics sucked was dead wrong."
3,Face2Face is boring!,"The babies in this video are cute, but there isn't much activity and the music is slow and boring. I bought it for my 15 month old and she only lasts for about the first two minutes! It is too slow moving. ""Baby Songs"" videos are much better - more activity and cuter music."
3,"My Baby Likes This Video, BUT...","My 13 month old boy has seen so many videos. This is definitely in his top five. He loves baby faces, but the music makes him think it's bedtime. He gets fussy, so I usually play the radio to the video. Another video, ""Singing Babies Nursery Rhyme Time"" features baby faces that appear to be singing! They sing upbeat nursery rhymes with the wind down songs at the end of the tape. This works much better for my son's viewing habits, plus he is doubly drawn to the babies seemingly singing. I suppose ""Face2Face"" is good for someone who wants to get their child ready for a nap or bedtime, provided that the child is more willing to do that than mine."
5,The Men Who Found America,"This book was a gift from my Mother in the 1930's and I enjoyed it so much as it traced the exploration and development our Great Nation in vignettes related to each explorer as well as the country which financed and sent them on. How the name America came to pass and just who and how all these lengthy explorations took place as well as the mistakes some of them made in dealing with the Native populations they encountered. I reread this beloved book and then purchased a Kindle Edition for my grandchildren to enjoy as well.One detail I should mention is the additional discoveries covered in Mexico, Central and South America as, after all, North, South as well as Central America are all one large Joined Continent. If it were not for Coronado exploring Mexico he never would have found New Mexico and the country East of the Manzano Mountains in Eastern New Mexico."
1,Don't be fooled!,"I picked up this book thinking that it would be fun to read about Leif Ericsson and the Vikings, and imagine my surprise when it turned out to be about some Italian and Spanish guys who got to the Americas 500 years later! What a rip-off!!So, don't be fooled, this book is not about the men who found America, but about those who came later and conquered it."
4,A GOOD COMPILATION FROM HIS ARISTA YEARS,"I happen not to agree with the other only review on this album.This CD is a solid example of Iggy's amazing and hilarious extravaganza during the years 1979, 1980, 1981.Sure it would be better to buy the albums ""New Values"", ""Soldier"" and ""Party"", but if you're unsure of how Iggy sounded in the early 80's, then ""Pop Music"" is a good place to start."
3,Best of Indifferent Pop,"This collection fills in Iggy's early 1980's era very well. However, this was a curious period where Iggy's output was inconsistent. Some good tunes are ruined by indifferent production where there are too many dead spots in the tunes (nothing happening but the rhythm section; no melodies, lead lines, etc.) Still there are enough good songs in this collection to make it worthwhile if you can find this at a bargain price."
3,A fair read!,"The author's description of Mrs. Turner was very interesting. I think you can find people like that even today. That statement ""if it wuzn't for so many black folks it wouldn't be no race problem......"" is classic. The author makes a very strong point here.I also found the author's description of the hurricane that devastated the land, absolutely terrific.I had problems with the plot, which I found simplistic at times.Those silly mule jokes and the nature vs. caution topic didn't add anything. I also had a problem with the book starting at the very end when Janie Starks returns home."
5,There are not enough stars......,"There are not enough stars to give this book... period. I have often wished that Spike Lee would choose this book to do a movie on. I don't know how he would get the Okee Fanokee(hope spelling is right)swamp to rise like it did in the book, and perhaps he could never do the story justice, but it should be brought to the screen. Vanessa Williams is just right for the lead, and once I would have cast Wesley Snipes as Tea Cake, but now I might cast Will Smith. This book will affirm your life, it is wonderful. A must read on any list."
3,Slightly Disappointed,"I found the book to be a pleasant read, however I felt it lacked in a few areas. For one, I felt it lacked a certain element of surprise. I thought it to be too similar to any other book written on the same subject. I also thought that Hurston could have done a better job connecting the readers to Janie. Naturally you wanted things to go well for her, but I simply felt as though I was being told her story. I never got the feeling that I was there, with Janie while everything was happening to her. The characters never came alive to me, they remained flat throughout the story. I wouldn't disagree with teaching this book in a high school english class. I think it has a good message, and I believe that there are people who could connect with Janie on a deeper level."
4,A talent that has influenced many other writers,"It was eye-opening to finally read this wonderful piece of literature after having read many books by authors such as Alice Walker and Toni Morrison. I see so much of Hurston's influence in the workds of these two latter-day, African-American, female writers. I thank Hurston, therefore, not only for this revealing and touching book, but also for the perpetual influence it has left on the literary world. As we see Janie looking out into the darkness ""watching God"", so we also see the desire by black Americans, sepcifically women, to reveal their true nature, embrace it, and share it with a mainstream society that has taken it for granted or ignored it. The emotions in this book run deep and are extremely intense, forcing the reader to care for these people, for what they are, and see their struggles as worthy of respect."
3,It's an OK book,"This is a good book. If you have nothing else to do except sit on the couch all day watching t.v., then you should read it. But otherwise, it's not worth it. Especially when you've got Grapes of Wrath to read and study for the SAT's."
5,Book,Fast service; received new book in good shape. Very happy with your quality of customer service. Will recommend to everyone!
4,"My ""Eyes""",This is really worthwhile. It is refreshing to read something that is not so stereotypically married to it's genre.I will read more of her work and would recommend it to anyone.
4,Their eyes were watching God,"If you are a reader who enjoys reading classical materials, you will like this one. Very creative writing about a period of time in black history. The characters are well defined and the culture of the time is vividly depicted. A good read of a very fine classic.Their Eyes Were Watching God"
3,A confident women,"Zora Neale Hurston was a novelist, folklorist, and anthropologist. She was born on January 7th, 1891 in Eatonville, Flordia and is the fifth of eight children. On Steptember through March of 1936, Zora was in Haiti, where she wrote "" Their Eyes Were Watching God"" in seven weeks. The on September 1937 she returns back to the U.S and "" Their Eyes Were Watching God"" was published on September 18th. This book was the most highly acclaimed novel. This story is really good but is hard to read because of its native american language. This novel is about a girl named Janie Ceawford who lives with her grandmother because her mother ran off. Janie tells the story of her three marriages, her life, and how she overcomes. The one beautiful day she meets a younger man named Tea Cake who helps her enjoy her life. Her friend Pheoby is always there for her as she struggles through her journey."
3,Ambivalent feelings.,"""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" is probably an overlooked classic, but that is understandable. The plot isn't as strong as I had hoped for, and the hurricane isn't much of a focal point; I did not get a rich sense of history. At times, I struggled through reading the African-American vernacular, and I didn't get the hang of it until more than halfway. I never stopped pitying Janie and her hard times, and I was unhappy with her ending. I can't say I'll walk away with anything from reading this book. I ""sorta"" recommend."
2,didn't live up to the hype,"I was told I HAD to read this book. That it was the original book about the black American woman's experience. Yet, I did not find it engaging. The characters were poorly developed. While the story itself was a good one, and I understand that in its time it was remarkable, I did not find this novel impressive. Frankly, I did not care much about the characters because I barely knew them."
5,The most beautiful opening paragraph ever,"""Ship's at a distance have every man's wish on board"".You might never read a better opening sentence in a novel, but you need to read the rest of the paragraph to comprehend the brilliant and poignant insights of that simple and elegant opening. By the end of that first paragraph, I knew I was reading a greater talent than I had read for a long time. I don't exaggerate when I write that tears filled my eyes from the beauty of those first few lines. They can not be surpassed.Elegant, insightful writing that makes one thank god they can read.Michael P. SakowskiAuthor ""The Enterprise Zone"""
3,A great story but hard to follow,"I am currently reading this book at a university and I find it is one of the hardest books that I ever read. The story however is great and it shows how wemen have historically been abused, and seen as housewifes all along. Zora Neal really captures the feeling of the 30's-60's. I would recommend this book to a person if they have a lot of time on their hands."
5,Dialect,"I believe this book is one of the best I've read due to the fact of the dialect and use of language because if readers read the content out loud, readers can experience how they talked and almost how they felt. I thouroughly enjoyed this book."
4,Their Eyes Were Watching God,"The novel is about Janie Crawford, a woman living in Eaton, Florida. This novel starts off by explaining Janie's life from when she was a young girl to the present time, and by the end of the book she has brought you up to date. This novel showed excelent description of the characters and of the situations they face. It portrays the life of most black women of that time period. It is a way for Zora Neale Hurston to tell her story. It was very interesting and it made you feel as if you were watching it right in front of you!"
2,Important but Virtually Unreadable,"I understand the importance of this novel and I applaud Zora Neale Hurston as an American novelist who happens to be black and a woman to make such a name for herself in the literary world. But this book hurts my eyes and is so hard to read because you have to sit down and disect every sentence of dialect. There are ways to write an affective story and get the language across without making it completely unreadable. It takes so much longer to read than it should, and with the frustration of trying to read the dialect, the beautiful story gets lost, and I'm not even sure what it's about anymore. That's my opinion anyway, and I'm sure I'm not the only one."
3,Great shape...except for...,"Book was in great shape for the most part, however it looks like a little kid got ahold of it with a florescent pink marker or highlighter. The overall shape of the book is great, but I find the marks distracting when trying to read."
4,Modern Novels,"The story starts out with someone talking about death. The author of this book wanted to make it look like a lot of the characters didn't have an education. Chapter two starts out as Janie Starks seeing her life like a great tree leaf with the things suffered. Janie always mentioned sixty-acres when she went to see Logan Killicks. Janie's husband Joe Starks owned a store and a house. Janie spent most of her time working at the store. Joe often criticized Janie because, how she ran the store. He also criticized her on how she cut cigars and cigarettes. He would often come re-cut them for customers, so they wouldn't get any extra. Joe got really sick and eventually ended up dying."
1,Ah ain't gointuh rec'mend de buuk to nobody,"This book was a nightmare to read, unfortunatley I was required to read it and I could not throw it into the rubbish bin. The story was created just so Mrs. Hurston could use ""black vernacular"" or ebonix of the early 1900's. The sharp contrast between the ebonix and nornmal English narrative was NOT, in my opinion, a great literary device. It was neither educational nor informative to read long sections of dialogue like the sentence in the title of this review. Forcing myself to read improper English, to say the least, for an English class was very annoying. I don't think any educator would want me to write or speak like the dialogue in this book, so what is the point of reading it? The story was powerful and moving, but only if it had been written in English. Ah reckon dis be de en' of de review. Ah be wishin' dat Ah ain't gointuh hafta read nuttin' lak dis again. Isn't dis annoyin' yuh, imagine 200 pages of dis."
1,Review,"Well, i had to read this book for english class, so i didn't really enjoy it at all, however it is a good book."
1,Difficult to read,"I had to read this for Book club and HATED IT!The author writes in a dialect that is barely legible and makes the story less important than the dialogue. Yes, we get the point - now... can you write in English so I can understand each sentence the first time I read it?Thank you!"
3,More Style Than Substance,"Hurston's writing style and peripheral character creation were great, but I felt the story and plot were lacking in development. In my opinion, Janie is an under-developed protagonist; I would've liked to have more of an insight into Janie as a person outside of any relationship to a man. The book does not live with me after reading. The story is easily forgettable to me. The book is more style rather than substance.(via [...])"
5,An Amazing Story!,"Their Eyes Were Watching God is one of my favorite novels of all time - not only because it is poetic and amazingly descriptive, or because it has endured the test of time, but because it is a story that has touched me on a personal level. The herioine Janie Crawford is like many other women who live with uncontrollable circumstances, but somehow manage to be in complete command of their lives. She makes choices without looking back, remains true to herself and shows us it is always possible to have faith and find true love.Zora Neale Hurston was criticized severely for writing this book - Their Eyes Were Watching God was way ahead of its time - but her excellence as both writer and visionary have endured and the book is now a classic. A timeless, beautiful read. Every woman will love it. It's a great read for men as well."
4,Their Eyes Were Watching God,"I read this book for my English class. I think the story is interesting and original. When the book was first published many African Americans, like Richard Wright, did not like this book because of the dialect given to the characters, or the fact that there is rascism between African Americans. I think that adds another dimension to the book. More dynamic books are always more interesting.The book is about Janie. As Janie lays under a pear tree she sees how the bees and tree interact. She sees that as ideal love. This book shows how Janie goes from man to man searching for her pear tree. Whether or not she finds her dream of true love can be decided after you read the book."
5,"This book is great, should be a movie",She did a wonderful job writing this book. I love the way she wrote in down south lingo instead of trying to speak proper. I love this story. All the charactors are great. She put them all together perfectly.
3,An Interesting Insight into the Black Community,"While at times I was confused as to the general structure or skeleton of the book, I found Ms. Hurston's most well-known work to be emotional and full of humanity. The book follows the life of the main character, Janie, through her different husbands, socio-economic statuses, and surroundings. If you enjoyed Things Fall Apart or even Lee's To Kill A M-Bird, I think you would enjoy Their Eyes Were Watching God."
2,Just not my cup of tea,The book is about a spoiled unsatisfiable teenage girl whom keeps marrying men and then running away from her problems because she doesn't like her situation. I was forced to reed this book in school and i had no sympathy for the main character Janie. She needs to realize that the world is not perfect. The only part of the book that i actually cared for was at the begining of the book when she is gossiped about upon walking back to town and she ignores the gossip and holds her head high.
1,Not Good,"This book is, honestly, uninteresting. The main character is annoying- self obsessed, lazy, and expects to be treated like some amazing person without doing any work. It has random scenes, poorly worked in to the general plot line, just to make some completely unrelated point- a piece of completely worthless ""wisdom"". Of all the books I've had to read for school, this is the worst."
2,Note on physical quality of book.,"I received this book but was not warned about the fact that it is a deckle edge edition. while some may find a deckle edge to be fancy, I myself find this so-called tasteful craftsmanship to be infuriating as it does not allow to flip through pages easy when using it for reference. In order to flip certain pages, you must pick at them with your thumb and forefinger; this gets tedious and old very very quickly. My version is the one with the red and beige puzzle cover. I'll post pics in a bit, make sure this is something you can deal with."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,This book is painfully bad. I cannot recommend this book to anyone except masochists.
1,"Who made this a ""classic""?","I have no idea who decided this book was so great, but it is one of the most overrated books ever. Good Lord, it is simply dreadful. Stay away from it at all costs - if you have to read it for high school english class as I did, save yourself the trouble and buy the cliff's notes."
2,Not much good here,"The book is somewhat interesting in its depiction of the culture of the South. The plot is alright and there are many interesting metaphors throughout the novel, but for the most part it has little value."
3,THEY will tell you this is a must-read,"But as an AP English teacher, I can offer my humble opinion...This novel's renaissance coincided with the sad period in American Literature where the literature anthology was raped by the ""multicultural"" demon. ...don't expect to be transformed by this work of lit, which is memorable only for some vivid descriptions, and neat characterizations."
1,Terrible,"After reading this book, I felt as if my intellectual freedom had been ground under by the iron boot of PC liberal thuggery. It's a sad, sad day for literature when a book like this can actually be required reading in schools. It lacked form, character development, and grammatical elegance. Most of all, it attempted to beat the reader to death with the ""plight"" of the author."
3,Their Eyes were Watching Janie,"The novel The Eyes were Watching God was a book that grabbed my attention. I liked the contrast of Janie being a child when she was married to Joe and the being more of a mother figure when she was married to Tea Cake. Janie throughout the novel struggled to find the ""pear tree"" or true happiness. She started her life listening to always what her grandmother wanted and that led her nowhere. She then listened to herself and found Tea Cake and fell in love. This reviewer liked the parts of her courage like when she stood up to Joe and didn't take his abuse anymore. The action scenes were very well written and realistic. When Janie and Tea Cake were running from the storm it almost seemed like it was happening right in front of this reviewer. In conclusion the book's characters and plot was well thought out. This reviewer's only problem is the title I did not see God talked about much. Besides that the book was excellent."
5,beautifully written...,"i don't need to say anything, but if you have watched the movie please do yourself a great great great service and read this book... you'll LOVE it!"
4,A Great Piece of Literature,"I was assigned this book for and English course and as I had liked vbery few things I was ever told I had to read, I was all set to hate this book. It turned out to be one of the best books I've ever read. It is intelligent and witty, sweet and sad. It is a beautiful story even if at sometimes boring. I would recommend this novel to anyone who likes to read."
3,I got through it atleast,"Their Eyes Were Watching God is basically a story of an African-American woman's trek through life. She marries several times and when she finally ends up with the person she loves, but in the end she ends up alone again. She is happy.There really isn't anything bad about the book. There really isn't anything amazing about the book. Nothing really stands out as amazing but nothing stands out as bad either. Of course, it was a bit predictable, but I don't think that took away from whatever enjoyment of the story there was. If you're in the mood for a story of struggles and hardships, with a happy ending, this is it. But don't expect too much or you'll be disappointed."
4,Raw and Beautiful Emotional Work,"Up until probably page 200, I would have given this book 5 stars due simply to the language. Hurston's writing is so eloquent; it is a pleasure to read. I docked this book a star because the plot is pretty ambiguous and the ending is bitter (no sweetness). You grow to care about the character but then nothing really happens. This book is such a fantastic work of literature however, it is DEFINITELY worth reading."
4,Rough going but worth it,"Yes, I'm glad this book was rescued from obscurity. It has in incredible lyrical intensity, and some of the line I read over and over because they were pure poetry. I had trouble, however, with the dialect. It took me quite a while to read this book because I kept stumbling over some of the dialogue. I would love to hear this read by Ruby Dee on audio-book because I can imagine how wonderful the dialect SOUNDS."
3,Pretty Good Book,"This book was different from many books that I have read, however I wouldn't expect anything less from an African American-based book. The characters were fun, but there were way too many to keep track of in some parts. The plot and storyline were well-written, but lagged a little in places. The main character, Janie, was a good character to revolve the story around. Overall the book was intriguing, especially toward the end when something unexpected happens between Janie and her husband Tea Cake. There is also a lot of good symbolism used. Would recommend if you enjoy reading about African Americans or just want to add a new storyline to your book list."
4,The Way It Is,This is an excellent book with in depth dialect that relates to her feelings an at sometimes seems to be lacking some clarity. She is brilliant author and continues to show her great mataphors of the evolution of a young girl into the kingdom of sexuality and maturity
5,A fantastic book. One that should be read by all!!!!,"A well enjoyed, dog-earred, often looked back upon book. Hurston has a beautiful way with words. An interesting story, filled with bravery, kindness, self respect and, confidence. A real taste of living! Leaves the reader with an overwhelming sense of ""I've got to let the world know about this book!"" Don't let your bookshelf be without it!"
2,"nice writing style, but pointless","I read this book for school, and we went over all the good points of this book and its literary merit, etc. The writing style is smooth and descriptive, but I find the plot dull and trite. She is a teen searching for love and her voice, and the story is her traveling from husband to husband and her not being satisfied. The idea of her finding her voice is inconsistent and unfounded. If you want to read a book about a silly girl who doesn't know what to do with herself, and if you want to be bombarded with overused symbolism, be my guest and read ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" by Zora Neale Hurston. Only read it if you are looking at the writing style, do not read it for the plot."
2,Just okay--what's the big deal?,"I'll preface this by saying that I may be off base in my judgement of this book (and I invite others to agree or disagree with me), but I really don't understand the hooplas of praise it has garnered since it's reissue twenty years ago.While I agree that Hurston's prose style is lyrical and easy-to-read and her use of dialect quite effective, I have a problem with the novel's main character -- Janie. Are we supposed to look up to her as a paragon of oppressed African-American womanhood? I understand that she's abused (in essence) by her first two husbands, but Tea Cake doesn't strike me as any better yet she loves him above the others even though he most directly physically abuses her.I also found the climactic scenes of the novel rather sensationalized.What are we supposed to make of Janie? She doesn't seem to develop at all through the course of the novel.Maybe I just don't relate?"
3,Getting past the dialogue,"You can love this or hate it. The author was quite creative in using the Southern Negro dialect of the time. I found it difficult to get past the language at first, but eventually found that if I read aloud, I could catch on to the language and reading was easier and faster. The story is about a young black woman on her journey of self discovery--truly remarkable insight for that time period."
4,True love at it's best,This book was so enjoying. She writes so artistic and she makes you feel like you are right there watchin each scene being played out.Very descriptive and keeps you turning the pages.
4,Their Eyes Were Watching God...Great!,"This book is very powerful in the struggles of a beautiful lady named Janie. Living a horrible life of heartbreaks and no love from her 3 marriages, Janie still moved on. She looked for a better life to live to recieve better treatment and be someones wive and not slave. When she finds Tea Cake, she realized that her life became better with him and that she could live a happier life. She realized that she didn't deserve all that [stuff] that she has been through from her other 3 marriages. This book is great and i would recommend it to everyone to read."
4,Their Eyes Were Watching God,"Zora Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God is an amazing heartfelt novel about a young black women attempting to find her herself growing up in the Deep South. Hurston. The novel follows the life of Janie from a young girl to an elderly woman as she follows path after path down a journey of self-discovery. Each man that she marries seems to offer a new direction on the path and yet most do not offer the complete sense of fulfillment for which she seeks. Hurston seems to be able bring this out of the reader and allow them to contemplate their own sense of fulfillment in life.Yet the language of the novel is very difficult to read at times, I found that it only added to the feel of the story. It brings the story alive and throws you into the world in which the characters are living. It feels as though you know and understand Janie and can truly relate to the characters in the story.It was an amazing piece of literature that I truly enjoyed."
4,Finding Your True Self,"Their Eyes Were Watching God is a great book about a woman struggling to find herself. As an innocent teenager, Janie had dreams of true love being as pure as spring. Janie finds herself married to three different men throughout the novel. Logan, her first husband, treated Janie as if she was his worker. Jody pampered Janie, but kept her from being herself. He put Janie on a level above the town, when all Janie wanted was to fit in. Janie truly finds her spirit as she stands up for herself against Jody. Her final husband, TeaCake helps Janie to live and be herself. Janie represents a good example for women everywhere. The dialogue and description used helps to portray Janie as a strong, independent woman. The book delivers the message that women should let their spirits shine and not be held back by any man. Both men and women would enjoy reading this book."
4,What can I say about this book?,"It's almost silly to write a review of Their Eyes Were Watching God, because so many things have been said about it already. I liked the book tremendously. It is written in a powerful style, and you feel the pain and happiness that Janie goes through. It was a bit difficult for me at the beginning to follow the dialect, but after a while it was no longer so. This is a great novel, and I can see how Zora Neale Hurston's influence has touched a great deal of contemporary African American writers."
4,A Challanging yet amazing book,I really liked this book. I thought Janies life was interesting. it was a hard read. It was ahrd to understand but i loved it. I like reading about what people go through and how they deal with things. This was definitely one of those kinds of books. I strongly recommend it
2,Dubois got it right,"W.E.B. Dubois did not like this book at all! It was because it makes a mockery of African-American men. It's ture! They are portrayed as nothing more than monkeys. They have no sense of family, spirituality, commitment, determination. This book makes one root fot the Klan more than Gone With the Wind did! The only thing which keeps me from giving it 1 star is the beautifully written narration. It's abou the only part worth reading because the dialogue is simply IMPOSSIBLE to understand. Only read this book if you already hate your fellow man!"
2,"Not great, Not bad, Just average","Their Eyes Were Watching God is not a bad book. Indeed, it is adequately written, characters are fleshed out well, and the storyline is at times compelling. The big problem is that this book is touted as great literature- and it is not. I think alot of the adulation the book has received is more about the author's race than the quality of her work."
1,this book is horrible,My highschool class had to read this in class so due to the many people in our public schools who can hardly read this took us about a month and a half to read. The story didn't start off good for me because its a book written mainly for women and I am a man who enjoys a Tom Clancy novel well I felt that it also puts down the African American race by making it look as if most African Americans are like Tea Cakes who is a run around or the judge who beats his wife and treats her about as good as a slave (which isn't good at all). This book in my opinion is smut and if I where African American I'd be upset that people said this book showed the struggle of the African american it does not it does show many steryotypes similar to the ones that the movie hollywood shuffle fought against I'm sorry if that step on some toes but thats my opinion
2,HUH?,I didn't even finish the book because the slang dialogue was too complex. I hate when authors fill so many pages with slang because sometimes it makes it way too hard to understand or keep one's attention.
5,Another college class read,"When I saw this book, I was not excited to read it. I actually hate it when someone makes me read something because I love to read on my own. But I have to say this book surprised and delighted me and I had difficulty putting it down. I recommend it to anyone who likes to read."
3,Just Okay,"It's just ok. Reading it for a book discussion group. Kind of hard to get past all the dialect, so it's just ok"
2,"And the point is what, now?","I (was forced to) read this book for an English class. I began reading, and found, within a very short period of time, that I really didn't care what Janie did with herself. There are so many great pieces of literature out there, so many truly meaningful, inciteful works, that this hardly seems the thing to be wasting the young impressionable minds of our high schoolers on. It might be a decent read, but certainly not comparable to a Melville, Bradbury, or Richard Wright."
1,Waste of talent,"This book was a huge disappointment for me. Janie, as the main character, should be the most well-rounded character in the novel, but she is so flat and two-dimensional that I honestly didn't care what happened to her. Even the mule was more interesting than she was. Changes in attitude come out of left-field (she decides that she hated her grandmother all along in the course of three sentences, contrary to all previous evidence), and so much time was spent describing her unparalleled beauty that it left me nauseous.The worst part for me was that Hurston was obviously a very talented writer. Every once and a while, there would be a flash of brilliance in the narration that would make me smile, but the bland main character and generally predicatable plot left me wishing Hurston had spent less time being poetic and more on developing Janie."
1,Very Over-Rated!,"It is a mystery why people think this is such a great book. Perhaps I'm not ""artsy"" enough, but I fail to see the genious in this book. Aside from the colloquial jargon, which I admit, takes talent (but is very annoying), there is nothing that can keep this book up to the level of Faulkner's work (which it has been compared to). The plot is extremely linear and predictable, not to mention unbelieveable; that storm scene is so fake it came across as humorous. The main characters bother me, they make situations worse, for example: Sethe should've waited for a man she loved insead of jumping into situations. I know people make mistakes, but she never seemed to learn from them. I don't know why schools make students read this, it's a waste of time. There are many books of the same genre that are MUCH better, like Toni Morrison's Beloved (or any of her books for that matter). Beloved is deeper, more artistic, and more enjoyable."
3,Their Eyes Were Watching God,"This book was a hard read because of the language used, but overall a very good book."
3,THEIR EYES WERE WATCHING GOD,"I LOVED HER WRITING AND I HATED HER WRITING...I FOUND THE DESCRIPTIVE PASSAGES WERE BEAUTIFUL, IMAGINATIVE AND ORIGINAL..I FOUND THE DIALOGUE DIFFICULT TO READ..THERE IS NO READING THIS QUICKLY, ONE ALMOST HAS TO READ IT ALOUD TO UNDERSTAND IT. I WOULD LOVE TO LISTEN TO THIS BOOK ON TAPE...I THINK IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC!"
4,Classic,Once you start to understand the dialogue you start to realize that there is a decent story underneath it all. The dialogue adds authenticity of the time and it's culture. The most striking thing is that no matter what Jannie is determined to find happiness even if it is in an unlikely place.
4,Book in excellent cond.,Arrived in excellent condition. Took 4 days from order placed to being shipped out (which I thought was a bit slow even though web site said quick shippping).
5,Just what I had been looking for,My mother said she had been searching for a hard bound copy of this book for years.I found it on your website and ordered it.It got here very quickly and was in excellant shape.It looked so good it was hard to tell it was not used.It came so quick I was able to give it to her on time for Mothers day.thanks Donna
5,Hurston's novel,"The book came in on time as expected, in good condition. The novel was hard to read first, but once get used to it it became easier. Good reading!"
5,Wonderful,This is an excellent story of a woman trying to find herself. But don't mess up the story the way Oprah did in her made for tv showing of it: Tea Cake is not a hero!! I wrote a whole fraking essay on why he isn't a hero to Janie. Seriously.
5,Zora as Muse,"Criticized for not writing a protest novel by some of her fellow African-American writers of the time, Zora instead wrote one of the most poetic novels ever written in the United States. Written in the vernacular of her African-American characters while narrated in standard form, this novel is a blues tale which uses both variations of the language to tranport the reader into the heart and soul of Janie, a young African-American woman in the 1930s on a search.Musical, heartbreaking, endearing, hilarious, and a novel where the issues of the day enter in horrific ways, this book's title has to best describe Zora as she wrote this book, divinely inspired. There is love, there is marriage, there is separation, there is an irrepressible woman who still speaks to all about the search all meaningful lives undertake.Alice Walker so loved this book and this author she restored her grave."
4,An Interesting Glimpse,"I read this book because I was a substitute teacher for an 11th grade literature class that was reading the book. Though it is not a book I would normally read, I enjoyed the glimpse Zora Hurston gave me into early 20th-century African American culture in the south. The literature class I was sitting in on drew out the symbolism of the two husbands prior to Tea Cup. And how this symbolized black women at that time in history. I found this interesting. I also enjoyed the postscript on the life of Zora Hurston, and how obscure she was until several years after her death. While the students complained about the African American slang, I enjoyed it and found that it made the story more real in my mind. The author used a lot of similes and metaphors that made the book fun to read."
5,This book was one of the best books I've ever read.,"Their Eyes Were Watching God. The story of a young lady, Janie Crawford's evolving life through three marriages, was very interesting. Every chapter of the book has it's on signifigance and meaning that a person would love to read. Once you've read the first chapter twice you'll grasp the language of the book. Once you sart reading you'll have a hard time booking the book down."
4,The true Love Story,"This is a timeless story of True Love--love that doesn't come from money or the (false) security of being kept in fine possessions. It tells the irony that ""owning"" a lover is not secure. But giving a lover the freedom to bloom means you will hold them forever, and they will possess your soul."
3,This novel was an experience in the life of another woman.,"It was very surprising. I enjoyed how I ""became the reader. It was different than most books I have read. I would never had read it if not for my English class. I liked the way the many different symbols were used, but I disliked the stereotypes of the black characters. I realy felt like I was being labeled a racist for something I had no part in, but otherise it was a nice book."
4,Poignant Love Story!,"I had a hard time getting into this book at first. Hurston chooses to go with the local color and let the characters in this story speak as they actually would have for the time and location. It took awhile for me to learn to decipher this language. Once I got beyond that I found a touching love story develope between socially prominent Janie and a lower class Tea Cake. Janie has never felt love before (her grandmother married her off at age 15 to ensure that she was taken care of) and goes against her friend's advisements in running off with Tea Cake. Their love and marriage endure many hard ships, but tragedy waits just around the corner. Soapy, but one of the few African American romances I've read that rings true."
5,The sensation of this book is definately on fire.,"In the book, ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"", Zora Neale Hurston paints a picture of reality, what life will teach you and it's rewards. How allowing someone to have some restrictions on your life (especially when you have no say so) will teach you to go for what you know and what your heart tells you. If going against the grain will make you stonger and happier, then go for it. BUT, you must be able to face the consequences, good or bad, with your head up high."
4,Splendid,"Their Eyes Were Watching God was one of those books that took my breathe and most of my sleeping hours away. Hurston uses a great technique of slang speech and standard English to add more pizzaz to the story. As Janie travels from man to man, she experiences life-long lessons that help her to find out who she really is. Indirectly each man and critical comment that Janie took in, created the woman she turned out to be. I found that this book was a delight to read and I would definitely recommend young women of today's century to read it."
5,Outstanding book...,"In my quest to read more classics, I picked up THEIR EYES WERE WATCHING GOD based on a list of 'have to read classics'. What a great book - I can see why this is a 'must read' book.The story centers around the life of Janie - her life growing up and her search for true love. The story is beautifully written - wonderful descriptions! It took me several pages to get used to the southern dialect of that time - but it is so necessary to help tell the story and draws you in. As Janie's life unfolds, you begin to feel a part of the story - I cried twice!It a great book - I highly recommend it!"
3,"Bad, but not that bad.","Though this book was written very well, no doubt about that, it was somewhat pointless. It was just about the life a certain person. To be honest I don't care. I won't say it wasn't written well, because it wasn't. Everything was good, except the plot. It was an ok book. Wasn't great, but wasn't the worst thing I've ever read."
4,Exceptional Book,I received this item within the time promised and the book is exceptional. No pages missing.
1,It is Boring,It is boring because it is about a topic that no one cares for. Stop speaking in ebonics. Chapters are way too long.
2,GET A REAL TAMBURA,"WHAT IS SO AWFUL, DREAFULLY AWFUL, ABOUT TOO MANY RECORDINGS OF CARNATIC MUSIC TODAY, A REAL CRYING SHAME, IS THE USE OF THESE HIDEOUS SOUNDING ELECTRONIC DRONE IMITATION TAMBURAS, THAT IN ADDITION TO HAVING AN IRRITATINGLY FAKE SYNTHETIC SOUND, ARE USUALLY ON TOO LOUD AND, WORSE, RECORDED RIGHT UP FRONT AHEAD OF THE MUSIC. THIS ALBUM, BY AN OTHERWISE EXCELLENT MUSICIAN, A REALLY FINE ONE, IS REALLY BADLY RECORDED, THE DRONE IS THE LOUDEST THING, AND THE MRIDANGAM ACCOMAPANIST SOUNDS LIKE HE IS IN A CAVE.IF YOU WANT TO HEAR WHAT WELL RECORDED CARNATIC MUSIC SOUNDS LIKE, AND GET GOOD LINER NOTES AT THE SAME TIME, GET VIDWAN: RAMNAD KRISHAN ON NONESUCH. SEE MEDIEVALMUSIC.ORG FOR MORE INFO ON SAME. THANK YOU, AND SORRY, GANESH."
1,Terrible sound work makes this book impossible to listen to,"I really tried listening to this book because it seemed interesting. Unfortunately I couldn't even get through the first disc. I am not an audio engineer, so I can't tell if this is the fault of the person doing the reading or of the people who were supposed to do the post-production sound work. Sometimes the voice of the reader gets down to almost a whisper so quiet that I can't even hear the words without turning up the volume. Then she will say something really loud almost deafening me. I got tired of constantly turning volume up and down and ringing in my ears. Better buy an actual book and don't bother with this audio version."
4,New Edition,I like this book because it helps me so much in my teaching. Its really relevant to the content of our course. But unfortunately no new edition and this book is out of print. so i have to borrow this book from the library and renew it again and again.
5,"Fresh, Quirky, Funny, Intelligent",This has got to be one of the most original and funniest series I have seen in a long long time. You manage to feel for the characters in the show and really build a connection with each of them. The plot each week is always well thought out and followed through. Not predictable in any way and just a really fresh idea! Extremely entertaining and overall an excellent series that really is absolutely worth watching.
4,There is an episode missing (the best one) and the air dates are wrong.,"This format does not include the best of all the episodes S2 E7, the christmas episode. It introduces 2 new characters Seth and Marnie, and is hilarious!The text at the top says ""Get Every Epiode of Season 2"" but they omit the best episode! False advertising!Also the air dates are all wrong. Correct Dates Follow:S2E1 = 11/11/2010S2E2 = 11/18/2010S2E3 = 11/25/2010S2E4 = 12/2/2010S2E5 = 12/9/2010S2E6 = 12/16/2010S2E7 (Christmas Episode Amazon Does not Include) = 12/19/2010"
1,Only first 3 episodes of the season?,Why are there only the first three episodes available? There should be seven?I LOVE the show but it gets one star b/c there are only 3 episodes available.
4,an ok book,This book was good since it goes through each competency and gives the formulas and examples. The answers for the practice test also have an explanation to tell how they got the answer. There were some typos in the book and in some of the problems which did make it irritating at times.
1,Don't waste your money,"This book has to be one of the most poorly writen guides I have ever encountered. Besides the gramatical errors, the answers to questions in the book weren't even correct. Until I realized that the book was wrong, I spent hours trying to caluclate the questions, and even called texas intruments to see if the settings were wrong on my calculator. I mostly used the guide as subjects on the exam that I needed to research on the internet. By the way, half of the topics on the exam weren't in the book."
3,"I don't like it, but it will do","This product is lacking in interest and fun. After watching the ""Quack"" videos, this product was a real let down. I found myself looking and the wishing that Quack would make more of their awesome SAT videos. If your looking for a good SAT video, I would look into Quack. If you have already watch both sets of ""Quack"", maybe you'll be as desperate as I was to get these vidoes."
4,Well written with great pictures,"This book is well written and has nicely detailed pictures of microscopic urines. I have a few complaints about how concise it is in certain sections. It was too brief when explaining the most often examined urine elements. I think that expanded explanations should have been included with bilirubin, urobilinogen, protein, etc. The explanation of the Ehrlich reaction in particular left me stumped. One or two more sentences would have made it clear.The section on crystals was well done and the pictures were great."
4,body fluids,"Very nice book. Easy to understand and take along to class. It could use a few more microscope pictures, but overall an excellent product. Very informative, and gives you what you need. Well organized too."
4,Body Fluids Analysis for Lab Science,"Concise, somewhat clear, and well illustrated and summarized text and review/ref packed with useful info. for lab analysis. Few errors/ommissions and excellent end of chapter review questions. I thought the first couple chapters were a little heavy. So if you feel a little intimidated at first, as I did, i suggest moving/skipping forward and going back as necess. Good-very good overall, but not perfect."
3,"Used ok, but with a name written on cover!?!","In good shape but ""used"" with a persons name written on cover and inside! It was inpretty decent shape but I should have been told that a person had written their nameon cover and on the inside title page. Not good!"
3,Under the House,"Under the House, by Leslie Hall PinderThis is a grand old American family drama, redolent of black and white movies, starring say Burton and Taylor and with a tyrannical pater familias perhaps played by Orson Welles. The first part is dominated by a dramatic dinner in which sibling rivalries find fertile ground in arguments over a will. This leads to another American staple - the protacted court scene, presented with the kind of legal accuracy that might be expected from an author with long professional experience in the field. The book was first published in 1986 and readers of Leslie Pinder's later novels will welcome the opportunity created by Shelfstealers to catch up with her earlier work.Leslie Rocker, playwright, poet and novelist."
5,Awesome look into the mentality of the dysfunctional family,"Under the House, by Leslie Hall Pinder, is a charming novel about a dysfunctional family, the Rathbones, who struggle with families lies and secrecy. Evelyn, the youngest of the clan, is sent away to boarding school to silence her from speaking out and asking questions about the identity of her father and other painful secrets. In the end the brittle house built on secret incest and abuse falls apart, leaving the characters to find themselves and re-invent themselves on terms other than those as members of a family. I found this to be an entertaining read, and not disturbing or depressing at all. The sense of humor of the author carries it along.Doug Bremner, author ofthe Goose that Laid the Golden Egg"
5,A subtly moving novel that stays with you after you've finished,"I'm a fan of poetry, and Ms. Pinder doesn't disappoint. Her writing is powerful and poetic, yet never interferes with the story.But even more impressive to me is the fact that the story stayed with me - stays with me still - long after finishing it. This is even more surprising because Pinder's writing is subtle and makes you think.Well worth reading, and so is Pinder's latest,Bring Me One Of Everything."
2,Introduction to Physical Gas Dynamics,This book is fairly old and I don't feel that it gives enough example problems.
3,Acrobat 8,"Better than release 6, but still too frustrating for the common user to use. It would help if the interface were more intuitive, but it is Adobe and they still prefer to make it appear as a ported Mac product."
3,Just a technical manual,"This is a good book if you want to learn how to accurately shoot a Japanese Yumi, but dare not call it Kyudo. In Kyudo you practice technique so you don't have to use it. If all you are interested in is how to put an arrow on a piece of paper from 90ft away, this book is for you. If you are new to Kyudo, in this case, this book would be of some help, but it is only one piece of the puzzle, 1/3 to be exact. If you consider this book to only be the first third of Kyudo, then this is one of the better books detailing that particular part. It will surly get you started."
5,Funny; thorough yet respectful; highly recommended,"This book was an enjoyable read and I would recommend it to any Bragg fan. There are plenty of amusing stories and the photos are worth the price alone. It's all about Billy -- how can you go wrong? One warning: The title is just the first in a series of bad, bad puns. ;)"
1,Billy Bragg: Still Suitable for Miners,Billy Bragg's - Still Suitable for Miners might be great for Miner but not for Americans. If you are looking for insights into the music and the motiviations that created the great body of music avoid this book.
3,buy the NOVEL!,"Good book, but it's pretty redundant if you have the actual novel (by the amazing Hunter S. Thompson). So you don't really need it. Unless you simply must buy every piece of Fear and Loathing merchandise you see. In that case, go right ahead."
4,Good work shoes!!!,"""I actually bought these shoes (Black color) for around $60 through a sale and promotion. For the price I paid, its money well spent. I did have a lil trouble with the laces being slippery and untangling itself the first couple of uses. Not too fancy or flashy, more of a traditional work type of shoe, which is what I use them for. Delivery was on time. Would buy from this seller again."""
2,It's OK but...,"I think this course has some good features - it teaches you some useful phrases, without too much attention to the grammatical reasons behind them, eg., so if you wanted to just get out and have a go, you'd have something to work with. But my complaint is the same - if you want to start to understand, learn and apply rules, the grammar is spread all over the place, and only part of it - the 'easier' bits - seems to be included in the book at all. It does a bit of the accusative, eg., but not the more complicated aspects, and nowhere does it bring all the rules applying to any case together in one place, so you're left guessing a bit what the rules might be (eg. instrumental). If you wanted a phrase book, you'd buy a phrase book. You can learn some vocab, of course, but it's hard to apply it more broadly without the knowledge of the grammar to do so. The CDs are useful as far as they go, but they're not great. It's OK, but I'd expect more for the price."
2,Maybe I'm justing getting older,"I have read all of the Artimis Fowl Books and loved them until nowI was disapointed with this one, and not found Artmis unusaly irritating, but felt the whole book was the lacking the charm and wit that had made the other three so good.Truth be told I was younger when I read the first three, but still I can reread them and enjoy them (as I did after reading the fourth and being very disillusioned with the whole seris) so if you want my advice then I suggst you don't buy this book and let the magic of the first three live in peace."
5,Where would we be without friends?,"Eoin Colfer, came to New York (White Plains). Remember how it's said that God created man in his own image? Well, Mr. Colfer must have created Artemis in his image, when Artemis become a real man then he will be Mr Colfer's image re-created, or at least in the image I picture Artemis to be.I just want to say if Mr. Colfer ever comes to your city or town take the opportunity to go see him Funnnnny guy. I wish I could have had enought nerve to ask him questions about his book and his self, but because I was the only adult black person there I felt...well a bit out of place.I had such a wonderful experience just hearing him speak in his wonderful Irish brogue. He was delightful. Enough about Eoin.Artemis Fowl Book 4 does not disappoint, it was just as good as the other three. I am loving Mulch, he always come thru. Good book, good series.Next time I don't care,I am going to say somthing to Mr. Colfer."
5,REALLY GOOD,I am very pleased with the humor! KEEP IT UP! Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm m m m m m mxmmxmxmxmmxm m m m
5,AWESOME AMAZING,ONE OF THE BEST ARTEMIS FOWL BOOKS I`'VE READ BY A LOBG SHOT I CAN`T WAIT TO SEE WHAT`S IN STORE FOR THE NEXT BOOK OF ARTEMIS FOWL I'M GOING TO DOWNLOAD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
4,Enjoy,Like most fairy tales this is an enjoyable one that ends with a happy ending. The plot is well written and you'll enjoy the elf's and fairies all the way. So open the book read and enjoy.
4,Best one yet.,"I feel you should always end an Artemis Fowl book with a feeling of deep contentment, yet with the unerring feeling that someone has just pulled the rug from under your feet. In a good way.Artemis' development through the books has fascinated me. We don't see any of Juliet, but plenty of Holly (in somewhat extenuating circumstances) and lots of our old favourites.Be prepared for a shock or two though. I won't spoil it. Just read it."
5,ARTEMIS FOWL IS BACK,"This is probably the the most action packed Artemis Fowl book so far. This time he doesn't have a clue about whats going on. Holly Short a lep officer and Artemis himself are trapped and are thrown into a deserted theme park with bull trolls. Then they are sprayed with a mist that smells like a female troll in heat. I want tell you anymore, you'll have to read the book to find out. Artemis might be highly intelligent but he's no athlete. He is a criminal. He is going to steal one more thing before the book is over. The settings I should say are Fowl Manor, the 11 Wonders of the World Theme Park, andHaven City."
4,Fine...but not the best of the group,"A good book. Not the best of the Artemis Fowl series. The Eternity Code was definitely the best for me. But on to the Opal Deception. It concerns Opal Koboi, perhaps you remember her, from the second of the books. Having been in a self-induced in a coma for about a year, Opal Koboi has been planning revenge. With some help, she revives herself and places a perfect clone in her place, and executes her plan. Soon Holly must call upon the only person who had ever outsmarted Koboi, Artemis Fowl. So the adventure begins. A very good adventure and a definitely exciting book, but I find that Artemis doesn't seem much like a person in this one. In the other books you could really tell who he is and imagine him, in this book it just doesn't work for me. But an exciting book nonetheless. Hats off to you once again Mr.Colfer!"
3,Good.. but not Colfer's Best Work,"Colfer, in my opinion, has slipped a little in this latest addition. Wasn't as pleased with it as the rest. The plot is good in the beginning, but the end , in my honest opinion, is frankly dreadful. Sorry.. but the third one was my favorite."
2,arty has lost it,"i found all the other books in this series great reads, i would review them as five star, i found this book lacking in a rational plot, in most places everything is made to convinient, or the places were eoin colfer couldn't make the book convinient he seems to have made it totaly irrasional. It is with a sad heart i give this book only two stars."
4,Stop telling ppl who haven't read the book yet things!!!!!!!,"I totally agree. I think I would have taken the news a lot lighter if you hadn't written it online about Commander Root getting killed... as it were, I'm now pretty certain most of my friends are going to gasp in horror and probably shout at me for telling them!I would give 5 stars(because I'm pretty sure it's going to be just as good as all the others), but I took one away for the fact that now I know that one of my favourite characters are dead :'("
3,NOT THE BEST IN THE SERIES,"Yeah, yeah, yeah...everyone knows that the Artemis FOwl series is the best. However, this book may just have just changed all that. Although there still are some ""Colfer"" style in the book, the book is losing its taste. Honestly, this book was the worst out of the series. Hey, don't get me wrong here. It isnot that I hate it, but it is my least favorite. I believe that most people will agree with me that COlfer's debut book, Artemis FOwl, is the best book ever. If you are a fan of COlfer's books, I suggest you read it, but be ready for some disappointment from his latest book. (...)"
3,A bit of a let down,i went to my local book store to pick up a book and ARTEMIS FOWL four is there of course i buy it and read it for a couple of days straight the problem is that the other books are soo awesome this one seems to be on a smaller scale than the others what i liked was the ending and how they made a sequel inevitable
3,Artemis Fowl--Going Straight?,"One of my favorite aspects of the first Artemis Fowl book was Fowl's complete disregard for the rules. Yet now, Artemis Fowl has finally decided to give up his old lifestyle, and do things the legal way. In Book 3, he vowed to do this, but quickly forgot with the help of a mind wipe. This book seemed to be written by a completely different author. Fowl was still as cocky as ever, but he shows remorse for his actions. He becomes bored by stealing. He is unable to understand the notion that the fairies are in existence deep underground. For a genius master thief, he isn't as intelligent as you might expect. I was quite disappointed by the end, mostly for the same reasons as I said above. I end by saying, ""Why did Root have to die!!!"""
3,Too predictable,"First, I will tell you that all of the important events and twists, I saw coming. In nigh every book I've read, good triumphs over evil. Same here (Sorry if the ending wasn't obvious to you). If it weren't for Eoin Colfer's epic writing skills, I doubt that I would have finished the book. Since Artemis Fowl is a series, it is a prerequisite for the later books (Time Paradox is the best.)"
5,great,"This book was great! It was not the edition i expected but still has the same content. I read this 496 page book in one day easily. I would definatly recommend buying the lost colony with this book. I would STRONGLY suggest reading Artemis Fowl, Artemis Fowl: The Artic Incident, and Artemis Fowl: The Eternity Code first."
5,"Another ""Artemus"" winner from Eoin Colfer.","A good, fun entertaining read.This book (the fourth in the Artemus Fowl series), while it might have been intended for an adolescent audience, has an adult sense of humor and cynicism. The plot is face paced, witty, and clever in its development; it also has several spots that are funny enough to give you an unexpected chuckle or two.All in all a satisfying continuation of the Artemus series. Recommended for anyone, any age with a liking for books leaning to the fantasy/adventure genre."
4,Review of Artemis Fowl,This book artemis fowl Opal of Decption is a great book because how the book is organized this book . This book also has great characters. Artemis Fowl a criminal master mind that steals expensive items that is valuable. When his mind is erased and one of his enemies Opal watches what he does. He forgets about the people he hates. At the begininig of the book Artemis goes to steal a vaulable painting in europe. This book will be interresting because of the suspense and Plot that develops.
4,Artemis Fowl repeat,Artemis Fowl is a fast read but quite enjoyable. My grandsons and I have been following the adventures through several books now and look forward to another.
5,Review,"The first thing I noticed about this fourth volume is that it was much darker than the others. I don't want to spoil, so I'll just say that I never thought Colfer would write anything other than a happy ending. The other books were, as Holly put it, like 'a cartoon' compared to this one. Until now, Colfer had been on my list as a good writer of comedy. Now I put him in the general 'good writer' category. Not to say that this one wasn't funny; Mulch cracks me up. But it was much darker. I simply loved it."
3,Artemis Fowl,"This fiction book is a good read if you are at a young age. The range I would give for it would be anywhere from the age of 9 to around 13 or 14, at latest.After Artemis had been mind wiped by the LEP. He awoke and was currently chasing the paining: The Fairy Thief. By chasing this painting, he has been led on a giant journey in which he is almost killed many times.This book is filled with magic, mythical creatures, and if at best, action. Eoin Colfer is still one of my favorite writers, but this is one book I didn't really think should be reccomended to very many pople. I have read every other book in the series, but I don't think that this was a good way to end it. Now that Artemis and Holly Short teamed back up, there is more things to read about, either it was running from trolls or stopping an evil mastermind, I don't think that this book was good enough to put on my shelf."
4,My son stopped playing video games long enough to read this!,"my 13 year old, brainy son is a video game addict, but there are a few book series he enjoys, Artemis Fowl being one. He said ""it's pretty good""."
2,DON'T GET THIS,DO NOT get this! This book isn't that good! The Eternity Code was a much better ending for the Artemis Fowl series. The beginning is good but the middle and ending are weak. This book just doesn't capture the feel of the other books in the series.
2,Minority Report,"I am definitely in the minority here but I could not get into this book. I tried twice and managed to get about one quarter of the way through it, largely because the Yahoo Bookworms' book group is reading it. Alas, eventually I told myself that life is short and I can't be bothered reading something that I don't like!What I did like about the book was the concept of a criminal teenage protagonist, and I liked the cloning aspect and the basic plot. What I didn't like was the characters. I just couldn't stand Artemis and found him to be elusive and not that well developed.Surprising because I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and I expected to liked this book."
4,Slightly disappionteing,"Artemis Fowl may still have his genius, but hes losing his touch. I bought this book two days ago and have read it three times. Sure its a good book but it isn't as good as the older ones. I think this was not the greatest direction for the story. Not to say I don't look forward to a 5th and likely a 6th. After all, who stops at 4, or 5 for that matter.Ultamitely I recommend the book but don't expect such a beautiful master plan like a Eternity Code, or the mystery of the other two."
5,Opal is Back,"This is a five star book about Artemis Fowl. Artemis and his friends, Butler, Holly, Mulch, and Foaly, had to defeat Opal Koboi. Opal's evil plot was to become human (she was a pixie) send a human probe to Haven by detonating charges parallel to a fairy underground tunnel, and destroy all elves, pixies, centaurs, and other mythical creatures. Artemis and the others stole the charges and saved the world.My favorite character was Mulch. He is a funny dwarf that loves to eat and dig. He is a thief and the only funny person in the whole book.I like this book and anybody that loved Harry Potter will love this book. There are many tight spot situations and a whole lot of fighting.My favorite part was when the trolls where attacking. Holly and Artemis had to"
5,Just what I needed,"Used this book in one of my college classes and it is just what I needed. If you are a singer/musical performer this is THE BOOK you need to read. Makes you think clearly and realistically. Changed my life, seriously!"
5,Beyond Talent: Creating a Successful Career in Music,Bought this book for my daughter who is just starting her college career as a Music Major.
5,Beyond Talent is beyond fantastic!,"As every performer realizes very quickly upon leaving the safety of the educational institution, talent alone is simply not enough to get you to the top, let alone steady work. An artist must wear many ""hats"", and one can get easily overwhelmed/lost trying to figure it all out. ""Beyond Talent"" provides an excellent road map, covering all of the aspects of this business that I wish they had taught me when I was in school! The book is easy to navigate, concisely worded, with easy to follow examples. So whether I'm looking to research a topic, or just need a quick answer, ""Beyond Talent"" has me covered.This is a wonderful resource and I highly recommend it!"
5,Impressive CD by the Pianist,"Could not wait to get my hands on this one. Sorry, but did have to buy it elsewhere. Could not wait. After seing the movie I wanted to know more about this man and what he played. It includes his version of Chopin's Nocturne as performed on the end credits. Great !Only sorry that I did not get such a good deal as from Amazon. This is a keeper !"
2,Too much reality,"Like one of the previous reviewers I purchased this movie on the reputations of Cate Blanchett & Sam Neill. Should have read the description of the movie on the back of the box more closely.I generally watch a movie for the escape from reality factor. This one too closely mirrors the reality I see and read about in western society everyday.If I want to see drug addicted losers with no morals all I have to do is view the world that surrounds me on any given day.So I give the movie two stars not for the acting, but for the content.I don't find a story line that features druggies and the drama that surrounds their lives particularly intriguing or entertaining."
2,Bad Audio,"Perhaps we rented a bad copy, but I missed at least 30% of the conversations because of a combination of strong Aussie accent combined with use of Aussie slang that I couldn't translate quickly enough and just plain bad audio. The words sounded like they were being mumbled at times.The movie itself was a typical slow moving Aussie film that works hard at character development. If you like films about the intricacies of dysfunctional family relationships you should like this film...if you can hear it."
2,Misleading box art and remarks strikes again.,"According to the DVD this is supposed to be a Psychological Thriller. Another review on the box says ""Your hairs will stand up on end.""Its nothing but a long drama similar shot similarly to Laguna Beach and Eastenders. Nothing really exciting happens, but if you like drama you may like this. I was expecting something else."
4,Good Film,"This is what I would call a very interesting drama...it's never boring and the plot and storyline are there to see. It has good acting with a mix of risque, grit and determination from the characters.I recommend this film."
1,"Fast forward thru first 20 minutes, maybe something happens after that","Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving and Sam Neil are great actors. Unfortunately their combined talents weren't able to rescue this slow moving, pointless and boring movie, or at least that's how I'd describe the first 20 minutes. I gave up watching it at that point. Maybe the movie magically turns into this critically acclaimed wunderfest after that."
4,nice microwave cart,"easy to assemble instructions, lots of roomy storage on bottom, very sturdy considering you do have to assemble it, excellent seller, tight packaging, would recommend"
4,A Modern Allegory,"Its an earthy, Dantesque parable about redemption - a contemporary morality play not unlike Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress (with Mickey Rourke!).Yes its hokey on the first viewing, but pleasingly profound on the second.Its a legitimate work of art. Not a masterpiece, but a nice little portfolio piece for all involved.If you enjoy poetic symbolist work, not too heavy but with fallen angels, and classic heaven and hell allusions, then perhaps you appreciate this.Its worth thoughtful, repeat viewings.It would make a nice double feature with Terry Gilliam or M. Night Shyamalan."
3,"Dreamy, Different, and a Bit Puzzling","The best thing this story has working for it is originality. The second is a dreamy, surreal tone. The third is good acting and characterization. Yes, even from Ms. Fox, who was perfectly cast and gave a constant stream of believable frailty and emotion throughout the entire film.Who may not have been perfectly cast is Mickey Rourke, who was the main and most focused on character. It's his story. The problem is that he has zero chemistry or compatibility with Fox, who is his love interest in the piece. A love scene with he and Fox might possibly be the most awkward thing you've ever seen, not to mention all the other romantic scenes between them.Overall, this might have been a 4 or even 5 star film if I didn't want to reach in the screen and pull the two of them apart every time they got within 5 feet of each other."
1,Why is no one mentioning the truly creepy age difference?,25-year-old actress. Two sixty-year-old actors. Is it really necessary for me to go on?? Have we all lost our sense of decency to the point where this is sexy? Ew. Just ew.
3,Rourke and Fox Not a Good Love Mat,"Not bad for a film to watch once, but not a flick I would re-play. Meagan Fox does a superb job and makes the film. However, the mismatch in casting of Mickey Rourke fizzled the seductive passion. Alone, Rourke's character is portrayed well, but coupling him with Fox in this particular film poor casting. Passion Play was going for a hit pairing similar to Lost in Translation (ironically, Murray is in this film too) but they missed in convincing me of an ageless attraction. Rourke comes across more as a adoptive father figure, but the audience is supposed to sense the tension developing (intimately) into a love affair. Frankly, it was a bit creepy and rather disturbing. The story, concept and filming was artistic, but the casting (although star-packed) was wrong in chemistry. Perhaps other viewers will feel differently."
4,Amusing Art Film,"Passion Play reminds me of movies I used to see in the 70's at Art House Theaters,except those movies had people in them that you mostly didn't know and Passion Play has several very well known actors in it.It's fun seeing Mickey Rourke really acting like the Rourke I first saw years ago and I always enjoy Bill Murray as well as his brother Brian Doyle Murray each doing their thing. Megan Fox is the female lead and she's good but she has never really done much for me in any of her past work.But for me the truly exciting thing in the film is a glimpse of the late great Solomon Burke,performing at a sound check with his band,rocking like only he could while sitting on his throne.This is a rather slow paced film but never boring and it is a really good looking movie.Now that I own it,I will watch it again somewhere down the line."
2,"Not good, really boring","The producers leveraged a first rate eccentric cast. The acting performances of all three leads are between good and excellent. But, the screenplay is really bad. The movie is boring. The story does not move. Sometimes the camera just stands nearly still with no action, no talking, no meaning. The actors did their best to save the movie. But, they could not really pull it off as they had nothing to work with. Without a good story, what can you do?"
5,You have to read this book!,I read this book when I was nine and it keeps surfacing about once a year and I read it again (i'm 21 now!). It is a fantastic book which brings into light a lot of human eccentricities and quirks that the aliens come up against. Love it!
2,Elevator music with a beat,"I need a more pronounced beat in my walking, and music that's easier to listen to, or at least doesn't make me feel like I'm in the elevator going up to see the cardiologist instead of trying to postpone the visit for a few years."
5,Healthy Heart Walking CD,A very well thought out CD. I feel as if there is a coach with me every step of the way.
5,Tjhe Best,Finially after much searching and surfing I came up with thic CD it is really great. gieves you a great walk at 3 levels makes you feel GOOD
4,Love this movie,"I can't wait to buy this film, even though the trailer spoils the whole movie... I still watched it and I plan to buy it. Even though I knew what was going to happen, it still made me cry buckets. The acting is simply wonderful and the cinematography is beautiful. It reminds me of the cinematography of Young Victoria. Beautiful movie."
2,2 1/2 stars for a bleak picture that doesn't add up,"The first thing you notice about this bleak story of another time and place is the brown and grey sets and costumes. Everything from the building to the clothing to the interiors is all drab. So from the start, you know this isn't going to be any fun. I find it hard to believe that even children are so subdued that they can't play or even chase a ball past certain artificial boundaries. I was also waiting patiently for a reason why these now young adults can't just walk away from their fate of organ donation and ultimate death. Perhaps this is spelled out in the novel from which it originated but to me, it's just a big hole in the plot. Anyway the acting is fine, especially some of the children that control most of the first half of the film. Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley were good and Carey Mulligan almost saves the film as Kathy. In the end however, it's just a somber, bleak version of the world that doesn't make a lot of sense."
2,Never let me watch this again.,"Don't watch this video unless you want to feel a constant sense of depression throughout the entire viewing. There is no hope, only death by slow and constant vivisection in pursuit of vital organs. Heed these words. I have spoken."
2,Depressing as bloody hell,"I was really looking forward to seeing the film. It was well made and the acting is superb. That said, it's one of the most horribly depressing stories I've ever heard of. I would never watch it again, and now have no interest in reading the novel."
1,One of the most horrifying horror films I've seen!!!,"So, the only reason you exist is as property to be used as organ donors; when needed, you will be cut open and your organs will be removed, and when you can no longer be kept alive because there's too many of them missing, you're dead. This is nightmarish beyond belief! Think Nazism. Think Satanic ritual killing. Think of the most sadistic, hellish concept imaginable; you have no right to your life, you belong to someone else who tells you why you exist and when and how you will die. The reviewers who think this is a meditation on what it means to be human completely miss that this is a horror story beyond belief and indulge in the type of thinking that enabled and empowered the most evil regimes of history, especially the 20th century regimes of Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Amin, Pol Pot, ad nauseum. A pox on all your houses!!!"
2,Depressing,"The acting was very believable, however the subject matter was so depressing that it was difficult to watch. I wanted there to be a happy ending......."
2,The most depressing movie in the history of movies,"Performances great, directing great, cinematography great, but the subject matter? This is the most depressing movie in the history of movies. The studio tried to market it as a ""haunting"" movie about eternal love. And then they wondered why it didn't make any money. What did not make any sense to me was how these people just accepted their fate without almost a hint of a fight. I'm thankful we don't live in the dystopic (yes, I looked it up) society in which supposedly this story takes place, brrrr."
1,asininity in slow motion,"The plot can be summarized thus: some people realize they are part of a truly evil scheme and they do nothing. And by nothing I mean literally ""nothing"". They don't even seem to move much at all except for the occasionally eye flutter. To call this a ""movie"" is simply false advertising as no one moves. If I found out that I was the victim of a nationwide conspiracy to use my organs without my permission, not only would I move I would make sure some of the evil snots went down with me. I would slay - Conan the Barbarian style- every last one of the conspirators I could get my hands on. In short, anyone who falls within the following categories will hate this movie with all the passion which it lacks: (1) Americans (2) people with testosterone (3) people who have ever consumed caffeine (4) anyone who ever got up off their butt to do anything at all."
1,Horrible,What an awful piece of movie crap this was. I Will never get that time back! Would never recommend this movie!
1,Sorry guys its just a dumb idea,"Visually Great, acting solid-story is flat out stupid.The problem is the whole idea that clones would be treated worse than cattle is such a flimsy idea unsupported in any way the whole pile of garbage falls on itself. The technical aspects of how the cloning works, how they are raised and act leaves too many holes. The only reason there are good reviews is people love the author--no way this story stands on its own--it's bad Jr High sci-fi."
4,A Thought Provoking Film,"There have been several well-written reviews on this film and I will only voice my views on thisexceptional film.I was unable to finish the book so I have some knowledge of the story before viewing the film.It is a very well adapted, produced and executed film with flawless performances from the 3 leadactors, Carey Mulligan in particular. She carried the whole film and had never been better.The writer and the director formulated the film with all the right moves, mood, period setting, casting,photography, music, tempo.........It is a thought provoking film.Is it a cautionary tale?How do we define a human being?What are the limits of scientific research and practice?What are we?A well-made film adaption of a novel although cannot meet everyone's taste."
4,"Moving, beautifully filmed.","At times, Never Let Me Go falls victim to its own subtly, but for the most part, it is a touching, emotional story about identity and what makes us human. Great acting, and some amazing cinematography and art direction. You won't forget it."
4,MESMERIZING -- TOOK ME BY SURPRISE,"Don't miss this powerful and touching movie about the bonds and friendships among a group of English children at a boarding school with a shocking secret --SPOILER ALERT:They have been bred as clones for spare parts.ALERT OVER:I was mesmerized by the story and the poignancy of the circumstances. But mostly I was reminded how fleeting life is for all of us. This great film directed by Mark Romanek and starring Cary Mulligan, Keira Knightly and Andrew Garfield haunted me for days - and that's a good thing. Time called the source material ""the novel of the decade"" and I can see why."
2,ew.,This movie was depressing. I felt like i was in a rainy world of depression. that is what they probalby shot for though
2,Less than expected,"Good for rainy day when both of your legs are broken and you can't reach the sleeping pills.Well acted, beautifully photographed. Story line barely believable. In this movie's society, for people to know the horror of their fate and not act upon it stretches reason to the breaking point. Had this been placed in a Sci Fi setting, or a Nazi prison camp, it might have been a riveting drama. As it was, the only riveting moment in the entire film was when the headmistress comments on why the children submit their drawings for review.You keep asking yourself, ""Why would anyone put up with this""? All of the actors deserve a better story line."
2,SPOILER ALERT: Incredible downer,"I finished watching this movie half an hour ago, and I'm still depressed. When I got it, a friend said it was very sad, so I immediately figured out what it was about. The acting by Mulligan was superb. I really felt her scenes. The production values were first class. But I asked myself repeatedly as I watched the film, why did the protagonists not run away? It makes no sense to me why they stayed under those conditions. So it depressed me, and I'm still depressed. Give me ""Independence Day"" or ""The Fugitive"" or ""Die Hard"" any day where the protagonists fight back."
2,Puzzling and Depressing,"I think the hardest thing for me to wrap my head around was the concept that in the 80's and 90's there would be a plausible scenario where people were designated solely for organ donation; and that it was okay. I was practically screaming, ""Why don't you just cut off the bracelets and leave?"" I mean really? That is the biggest problem I had with the movie, because all of the characters seemed a little too comfortable and accepting of their circumstances and eventual fate, no one tried to run or fight. If it had been set in the 50's, like it kind of looked like it was, I would have been slightly more accepting of the premise, but otherwise I just couldn't accept the plot. The only saving grace of this movie was the actors, they all turned in pretty good performances, and ""almost"" made me believe the plot."
4,So different,"Beautifully acted and such a different type of story. Still not sure if it was partly sci-fi, or just an amazing imagination of the author."
3,An interesting interpretation of a fabulous book,"I enjoyed the movie but I adored the book. If I hadn't read the book I probably would have rated the movie higher. I spent a lot of viewing time missing the parts that were left out.However, the cast was engaging and the movie was well done and certainly covered a very ineresting subject that was unique."
5,Spectacular,"This movie was amazing! As a future healthcare provider and a lover of love, it spoke to me in so many ways. Although it goes against my normal rules, I might just have to go back and read the novel. I'd highly recommend this film to friends and family alike."
4,A LITTLE GEM,"I saw this movie because I thought it was some sort of sci/fy adventure and it looked interesting. Turns out it was certainly an interesting movie but not for the reasons I'd imagined. Never Let Me Go is basically a romance cloaked in the guise of a future world/clone tale. In some ways it reminded me of Blade Runner with its characters in search of a 'deferment' the same way those 'skin jobs' were looking for a way to add to their alloted years. But while Blade Runner characters were scary and clever, the characters in Never Let Me Go are gentle and so wanting of a future. I found the movie heart breaking in its vulverability and hopeful in a way, too. The acting was very understated and quiet, very gentle. I wish some time had been spent on explanation, but then that's because those are the kind of movies I like - the ones that have explanations, even crazy ones. Still, I was happy to have spent time with these sad, misled characters."
4,Nothing beautiful on human atrocity & sadness...,"I gave 4 stars because the movie is well done and excellent performed by the actors. Extremely sad history about HUMAN ATROCITY. Is very easy to reflect: ""who have NO SOUL ? "" The story shows the WORST of heartless human being, exploting and abusing innocent people with feelings considered ""creatures"". Really disgusting, sad, impressive story."
2,Couldn't find any plausibility.....,"...and hence I simply couldnt enjoy this movie. I could not for a minute believe that human donor ""programs"" would be accepted by any society with not ONE person being rebellious about it. I also wanted to know more about the program...there was a mention of other schools raising donors in subhuman ways. I would have been more interested in seeing how the program really worked then looking at the pathetic, doomed, love trio drama. Acting was ok but the story simply was not in the realm of even faintly plausible. For me, I need some link to reality in order to enjoy these dystopian type of films."
1,Never let me go,I thought this would be a love story. It was in a way but it was a disgusting story about selling body parts. A mind control over these poor kids that thoughgt they couldn't tell the adults NO.
5,Fabulous,"I am very happy I selected this CD, because I loved one song I heard,but there were many more that were just as good. This is my first CD by this artist, and now I have discovered another favorite!"
4,Awesome,"Mrs. Jackson has done it again. Gabe and Sage's story is one that you can definitely get wrapped up in. With all of the kissing, touching, and tasting...you won't want to put it down.I can't wait for Mrs. Jackson next book, and I'm am anixously awaiting Christy and Alex's story."
4,Good Book,"In Brenda's latest book we are reunited with Gabriel Blackwell from ""Perfect Timing."" Gabreil is Christopher Chandler's best friend. Their construction company is hired to build a extravagant resort in Alaska. Gabe decides to go and manage the project since Christopher is a family man. While at a business meeting he is atunned by the beauty of Sage Dunbar.Sage's world has just been turned upside down. She is distrustful of men since her two favorite men has betrayed her. She decides to take the job to get away and think. She was not lookinhg to find the love of her life.The relationship of Gabe and Sage blossoms at a good pace. Both of them had prior bad relationships but they had to look inside themselves to heal and let love take over and do the rest."
3,Oh Well...,"I really like Brenda Jackson. She's a great writer, but this book, Perfect Fit, is a little too slow for my taste. I not feeling neither Gabe Blackwell nor Sage Dunbar. There character isn't well defined for me to have a visual in my minds eyes. It's an ok read if you're looking for something to pass the time, but I don't feel any heat as I have in the other books I've read by Ms. Jackson. Usually, I can finish reading her books in a weeks time, sometimes, over the weekend, but it's taking me too long to even finish this book. Just because I'm not feeling this book, it may be a ""Perfect Fit"" for you."
3,Perfect Fit is not a perfect book,"It is well established that I'm a huge Brenda Jackson fan. I'm damn near done collecting every single book she's written. I must say that I've found a couple of her books not all that great, but still enjoyable to read. This is one of them. I'm not really feeling Gabe all that much. He seems boring to me. I'm not sure what it is but Gabe's story isn't all that great like Christopher's was in Perfect Timing. But I still love BJ. She's one of the best African-American romance novelist out there."
1,don't buy,"There was no plot, the characters were flat and the whole thing contrived. Will not buy another of her books."
5,One of the best books I have ever read,Saul bellows is one of the greatest novelists of our time. I actually sit open mouthed as I read his rich language.
3,Life is hard and then you get married.,"Slow moving story of a young romantic growing up in Depression torn Chicago. Augie pursues love, happiness, and the meaning of life. Unfortunately Augie finds only unhappiness in his pursiut for love, while he learns to understand life only when it has dealt him misfortune.The supporting charcters are compelling and memorable and Augie learns from everyone he encounters.My difficulty was with Bellow's prose which was long and ponderous and sometimes over my head. I would re-read many paragraphs and still not completely understand what Bellow was trying to say.Also if this book was supposed to be comedic the humor was lost on me."
1,Pointless,"Classic? Why? Slow, plodding and pointless. The style is pretentious and irritating. One doesn't care about any of the numerous characters. The narrator Augie isn't likable, and the so called adventures are nothing but a long string of stories that amount to nothing. Bellow seems to try to use every word he knows and in ways you've never heard in sentences that don't make sense."
1,I just couldn't get into it,"This was my first (and probably last) experience with a book by Saul Bellow. I found this book to be extremely difficult to read. I got through about a quarter of it before finally giving up and donating the book to the library. This book might be a classic, but quite honestly I found it boring."
5,Unquestionably One of the Best of the Century,"This sprawling novel is often quite evocative and nearly always entertaining. What it offers is essentially a satire on American culture--but as embodied in a magnificent array of sympathetic characters, both enthusiasts and outcasts. Augie's passivity makes him an ideal vehicle for this examination, and it's easy to identify with his bewilderment. With wise-cracking incisiveness, Bellow takes the American romanticism of writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and turns it on its ear."
5,A modern Candide,"Saul Bellow has addressed freedom and the saga of trying to find oneself and one's unique place in the world. The ending reminds me of Voltaire's solution to chaos: tend your own garden. I'll put good use to Saul's philosophies. Indeed, I found this book at a searching time in my life and my pursuits were reassured. I was spurred to read a novel by Saul Bellow after reading Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi."
3,I have been reading this book for TEN MONTHS now,"and I'm only up to page 175. Granted, in the past ten months, I have read about 40 other books, but still....The first two books I ever read by Bellow were the first two books he wrote: ""Dangling Man,"" and ""The Victim."" I didn't love them, but I did like them, and they did not take me long to complete.Then I read ""Mr. Sammler's Planet"" and ""Herzog,"" and I LOVED them.Then I read the novella ""Seize the Day,"" which I didn't care for, and it took me forever to finish, despite its short length.So, now I'm reading ""Augie,"" and I've set a goal to finish this book by New Year's Day, 2005. But I have a feeling I should change that ""5"" to a ""6.""Fellow readers, send some good vibes my way that I finish this book by 2005, or else I may be ""marching"" with Augie until I draw my last breath!P.S. Because of my love for ""Herzog"" and ""Sammler,"" I will never give up on Saul Bellow. I have ""Humboldt's Gift"" waiting patiently on my bookshelf for me."
4,He Tries!,"He is a good-hearted young man who tries to make a go of it, but, as Stella says, falls into the whims and desires of so many people he meets. He is taken along on a trip to smuggle people form Canada, goes along with his brother's whims and practically marries a woman chosen for him, goes to the shore with an employer, who wants to adopt him, runs off to Mexico with a strange woman and her eagle, ends up in Europe with yet another woman he doesn't say no to, and finds that marriage is less than he would have wanted. He doesn't seem to be able to take control of his own life. Undoubtedly there are many people like this, good hearted with a streak of innocence, but winding up with something less than success. And throughout the book one can see Bellow's disenchantment with rampant Capitalism, which is evident with the successful men in Augies experiences. I like Augie, and I sympathize with him. It's a good read . . get to know him, and learn about yourself."
1,Dull and tedious,"I'm sure it's really a masterpiece and that I have no patience, but I felt I was waiting for the story to really start. Then I discovered I was a couple of humdred pages into the book, and nothing seemed to be happening. I decided life is too short to read dull books."
3,A nice bunch of short stories,"I'm not going to write a long winded literary review. I think this book is best read as a series of short stories. I read a chapter a day and was able to get through it that way. I never had much interest in finding out what happened next. If you're into picaresque novels a la Tom Jones you will love this otherwise I would humbly suggest you skip it. It's too long and it rambles pointlessly. As I was reading it I wondered if an editor was ever used by Bellow. I plan to read at least one more of Mr. Bellow's works. Hopefully, it will be better than this one. One reviewer states this book alone deserved the Nobel Prize. I saw nothing in this book that deserved a Nobel Prize and most of you won't either. This book is nothing compared to Faulkner, Steinbeck, Hemingway or Morrison who have won the great prize and who's work blows this away."
1,Adventures? What adventures?,"Yes Ok the book deals well with relationships but to allude that Augie March had adventures is misleading. The most interesting part of the book is the ""hero's"" name and the lizard. Yes Augie you ""....may well be a flop"", that was the most relevant statement in the book and it came on page 536. I just wanted the book to get started and it was over."
5,The Great American Novel,"Martin Amis calls this the Great American Novel. It is difficult to disagree. I am not an American, but I'm a great admirer of contemporary American writers like Philip Roth, John Updike and Norman Mailer. No one , I think, has given me a sense of what it means to be an American quite like Saul Bellow. It is difficult to think of another novel as representative of the cacophonic genius of America as this one. Despite the very American setting and language, like all great books it achieves a universal resonance. This is largely because of Bellow's genius for rendering into words those unspeakable yearnings of the human heart. The title of the book is ironic; all life is an adventure, yours, mine and March's. Bellow has taken it upon himself to fill us with a sense of wonder about life's possibilities."
1,stupid looks,is cool looking but not practical. breaks very easuly and the top comes off when you pour with it
5,A lavishly illustrated history of American railroading.,"Lucius Beebe and Charles Clegg are well known railroad historians and it is easy to see why when you look at this book. It's 415 pages are full of entertaining history, folklore and railroad anecdotes illustrated with 870 photos and prints. Nearly every page has multiple pictures and they are big pictures, too, not ""thumb nails."" The articles tend to be short, mostly one or two pages including the illustrations. I found this format to be very entertaining and a joy to read. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the development of transportation in America."
2,Not much ado,"This just wasn't the page-turner for me. Her life was interesting, but more interesting were all the celebrities she knew and their 'dirty little secrets'."
3,Why was it taken off Kindle?,"Originally, I got a 'sample' of this book on my Kindle....but when I went back to buy it. It wasn't 'available'. WHY?I like Etta James and I was happy to read about her life, etc."
2,TMI,"I got bogged down with too many extraneous names too early in the book. It may be a good and tragic autobiography but, sadly, she does not have the star power (beyond THE one song) to keep me reading past Chapter 1."
3,What a sad story!,"Etta James was a before my time, but I'm familiar with her work. I've always been curious about the life that lead her to a serious drug addition. This book gives a detailed insight of her life. This truly is a sad story, but worth the read."
3,It's Collectors' Item,"Very old recordings (1948-1956 and 1973) and may be copied from original LP and SPs. Sound quality is quite poor, but its contents are full of rare recordings with Jobim, Donato, Farney, Alves, and Quitandinha Serenaders."
3,I Would Have Liked It Even More,"if some kid hadn't stolen my UPS package with this cd. What's up with kids these days? I bet he didn't even listen to it. I searched every local used cd store for weeks thinking no way a kid would keep a record by a bunch of old hippies, but some of these kids are hoarders apparently.Anyway I still miss Crabtree."
2,Relevant to today,"This book is well written and quite relevant to todays World of finance. It describes various events from the past which have helped to shape our global economy and inadvertantly have created the institutions which regulate our market -although regulation is not dealt with herein.Kindleberger's history though is often difficult to read as it does not follow a chronological structure. Further he assumes that the reader has attained a certain level of knowledge as he seems to only make very brief mention of certain events.This book would have been far better if it was chronological and far more detailed. Still a great read with some interesting lessons from the dim, dark past of speculative manias ...???"
2,Not a history - more of a survey,"Definitely NOT a ""Popular"" history. Very much a survey of the topic. Appears to me that there is an assumption that you are quite familiar with the events briefly alluded to in the discussion. Interesting concepts and fascinating historical glimpses. The details of the book's title will be found by reading the source notes and then going to the library to read the source documents."
3,Learning the Easy Way ! !,"This was indeed an easy way to learn the language. Simply by listening, you will have the foundation of speaking with/to a native Haitian. I was constantly commended on my pronounciation and context. I was also laughed at when I said certain words. I learned that depending on where you came from in Haiti the wording is very, very different.The speakers on the CD's were clear! ! !I would suggest this to all who are interested in learning the Haitian Creole language...."
3,Just a start,"While the CD's were a helpful way to learn some basic words and pronunciation, the practice dialogues seemed a bit unrealistic from my perspective. (I have never visitited a restaurant in Haiti). I was also puzzled by the ""reading"" exercises. One is asked to repeat a list of Creole words but the meaning of the words is never given. How hard would it have been to list the English meanings?"
3,Good start to Hatian Creole,"This series of lessons will help a learner start to differentiate words within phrases as well as learn some simple phrases. One big omission is that there is no written form of the lessons, which would be helpful in clarifying some of the words. Overall each lesson is short and easy to digest, and a good starter program."
1,Haitian Creole,"None of these books are good for learning the kreyol language that I know. I am trying to find a great teaching book on Amazon, but unfortunately it does not exist. The ones that they have are mostly dictionaries or audio tapes and CDs. That's not the way to learn a language especially the Haitian Creole. I would not recommend any of them."
5,Terrific!,"Great introduction to Creole. The Pimsleur method is excellent, I highly recommend to for anyone who wants a crash course in Haitian Creole."
2,Who edited this book?!?!,"This book is so poorly edited (I am giving the author the benefit of the doubt here!), that it is actually a chore to read it. There are glaring grammatical, spelling and continuity errors on almost every page. I read a lot of books and have never seen a worse editing job!"
1,nice pix - lousy narrative,"I am very disappointed by this book. While the pictures are plentiful and striking, the information in the book is essentially useless. While the authors make a valiant attempt to cover a breadth of species, they do so at the expense of providing any depth beyond what you might expect from your teenager's research report. The vast majority of photos are extreme close-ups of the blooms - great if you're looking for a coffee table book. Since there are few pictures of complete plants, however, the photos do not really aid in plant identification. Finally, a casual read uncovered three typos - all of which would have been caught through a spell check. I'm left thinking the authors were more interested in making a quick buck than making a quality contribution to the science and methods of orchid care."
4,this is a great product for it's price,"I waited to buy a deep fryer until I could find one that seemed 'reasonable' to clean. This Rival comes apart, with most parts able to be cleaned in the dishwasher. The only negative I have found, after using it to fry chicken wings, calamari and french fries, is that you need to ignore the ""ready"" light. It comes on when the oil is not hot enough to fry anything."
2,rival cool touch deep fryer model CZF530,"Have used this fryer for 2 years. It just stopped working in the middle of cooking fish for dinner. There was no reset button like the booklet said there was. Called customer service later and they apologized for the unit not having a reset button. Suggested the next time to unplug and wait 20 to 30 minutes and try again. Is this not crazy? Who would want to do this in the middle of cooking dinner. I loved the unit when it worked, but will not buy another one. Quality needs to be better. Customers service could not just send me a heating element part. They don't offer parts. Here we go, a throw away society. If it doesn't work, just throw it in the landfill!"
1,Crap,"I used this fryer 3 times and on the 3rd time it quit working mid fry. Tried other outlets to see if it was my socket, and still no power to the fryer. In the manual it states behind the control panel there is a reset button. There is no reset button. After looking at many complaints on this product, all have the same conclusion: No RESET button and the fryers only lasted for a short period of time. Do not waste a dime on this product."
2,Good design if only it would continue working,Loved the product until it stopped working after the fourth time I used it. The shipping cost to take advantage of the warranty was over half what I paid for it to begin with.
1,"Stopped heating, 2nd use","The second time I used this fryer, it stopped heating. I loved the way it came apart and you could put the pieces in the dishwasher, but if it craps out, the nice design is useless."
1,Junk,"Complete junk. My poor neighbor brought this to me to see if I could fix it. Besides being a piece of junk, it is unrepairable. Never buy another Rival product."
5,Great lighting for rental property,"Bought these for a rental property. They provide ample lighting for a kitchen island in one of the units. Three units were purchased. Again, price and free shipping made the deal even better."
3,royce bronze pendants,"These arrived on time and in good condition. Unfortunately, they weren't exactly what we were looking for, which is too bad because the price was right! We will be sending them back for a credit, as we have found something closer to what we had in mind."
2,No strategy cards on the kindle version,"I bought the kindle version of the book, and was looking forward to checking out the strategy cards. The author talks a lot about these strategy cards, and it seems like they are central to the book's intents. However, the strategy cards are nowhere to be found on the kindle edition! The tables are impossible to read on the kindle - the print is extremely tiny, and you can't increase the font size. Page references in the text are not hyperlinked, and the kindle version has no page numbers. Very confusing. Bottom line, this purchase feels like a scam without the strategy cards. Please do something about this!"
5,A Must Have Book Serious VP Players,"If you are new to the game of VP, and want to start off on the right track, order this excellent book today!This well written and formatted volume has much to offer seasoned players as well as those new to the game.The author, a former math teacher and curriculum director, not only knows her subject cold, but has done an enormous amountof research to back-up her theories.She is an expert Video Poker player as well. This is NOT a case of ""one who teaches because she cannot play the game the game""!In addition, she is a talented teacher, and imparts the needed information in a readable and easy to grasp style.The detachable, foldable, and very easy to use Strategy Cards, which are included at the back of the book, make the reasonable price of this book a genuine bargain.I have ordered several copies for video poker playing friends,and I know that they will benefit from reading this excellent book."
5,Great book for beginners,"This is a very well written book for beginners. Other authors on this subject introduce their books as suitable for a beginner in the first few chapters but the following chapters are difficult for the novice to read and understand. Linda Boyd, perhaps because she is an educator, writes clearly and fully introduces new vocabulary before using new terms in her explanations."
1,Please think first,"Ok, this movie wasn't good at all. I didn't like it one bit, I'm glad I recorded it on DVR instead of buying it. I will never waste my time watching this crappy movie ever again, the actors were probably too good for this movie. Please don't waste your time on this film!"
3,Okay but to fake great action though,This movie is okay but the fact that taking people out of prison to fight instead of a really special forces squad to do the job well watch it see what I meen
5,rare recipie collection as most are not as comprehesive,small book with lots of recipies. I have looked for newer cookbooks from the philippine cuisine but most don't have as many variations as this.
3,Basic Beginning Gardening,This book would be good for beginning gardeners. These are short articles with very basic information much of it not just specific for Bay Area gardening.
5,clarks sodium slip on shoes.,Clarks are the most comfortable shoes made. These look good and wear well. I have two pair of clarks shoes now and will deffinatly buy more in the future. thanks kent
2,"It's ok, but doesn't hold your attention","I'm sure these guys are great and have had great times together, and I have the greatest respect for them and their generation. However, the book just couldn't hold my attention. It just wasn't fun to read after the first couple chapters.I found myself having to make myself sit and read a chapter or two at a time just to get through it. The stories were interesting for a while, but then it was almost like the author was telling the same or very similar stories over and over...and none of the stories were really that ""wild"".There are a few interesting tidbits and historical references here, but if you're looking for a fun and entertaining book, this DEFINITELY IS NOT IT. I had to force myself to finish reading it."
1,don't bother,"I found this book to be a long winded tale about people the writer wishes he was. He tries to be associated with the original club, but is only loosely tied to them based on a revived patch (club). Save yourself the trouble and read one of Sonny Barger's books instead."
5,Interesting saga,"This was a well written book and gave a great history of the Boozefighters MC. I liked the openess and honesty of the author. Some MCs are secretive and don't want any ""outsiders"" to know any of their business. I found the book truly enjoyable and would recommend it to anyone interested in MC communities."
5,A really good reading book,"This book made me want to be there during the simpler times,when ya did something that wasn't completely within the boundaries of the law and and you weren't crucified for screwing up. My favorite part was the ride from southern cali to daytona and the money they made along the way. This book was a really good reading book."
4,A Strong Album,"I think that this is a pretty decent cd. Many people would think at first that it is all 2Pac and the Outlawz don't do much to support this cd. However, that is completely wrong. Of course, 2Pac makes a big contribution on this album, but the Outlawz hold their own on this album and do a very good job rappin with Pac. This album is making me want to get Ride Wit Us Or Collide Wit Us...All in all, this is a good buy and you should get this cd."
3,Just not the 2Pac style,"I don't really know what it is about this album, but it really isn't the 2Pac style. I really doubt that any of the tracks will hit any ""Top Whatever""...I bought mine because I like to say, ""Hey! I have all the Tupac albums!""."
3,Could Have Been Better,"2pac as always is off the hook. But he's got outlawz in every song. And it really brings it down. 2pac sounds best on his own. However the cd is still sweet, so I suggest you get it!"
5,great,this album is great it is definately one of the best lyrical albums (any genre) which has been released this year. these are probably tupac shakur's most emotional and positive lyrics to date
2,ahh this album is reaching for a hit,i like 2 pac and eveything i like his hardcore lyrics and beats but to tell you the truth this album is weak it has one or two good songs on it 8 and 4 are probably the best this cd has to offer i have no idea how anyone can give this cd 5 stars they must of just saw his name and thought the album would be good with out ever listening to it the outlawz for the most part sound god awful i mean they do have talent as you can see in 2 pac's greatest hits cd go get dmx's cd it is much better
5,"""good die young""","The production is pretty good. I gots to say that the Outlawz are annoying too me especially E.D.I. Amin. You peeps have to check out the ""good die young"" tribute video. In many of the songs i always have to forward to listen to 2pac or go to next song cuz of Outlawz. Im used to this habit. Enough said good album, RECOMMENDED"
4,"Not a bad album, but can't be compared to 2's original.","The excessive ""guest"" tracks in this cd give it 4, not 5, stars. Many tracks are not even in their original recording, since voice-overs were added to increase length and are not in the original underground recording as Tupac recorded them. Could be considered commerical as when Tupac passed away, so did his best work."
5,Makaveli THA DON!,"This is my favorate CD right now, every song on the CD is great, the Outlawz are great rappers and 2Pac is the best, pick up this CD right now"
1,This Cd (is bad),2 pac is the greatest artist ever but i think he was high while writin this. don't buy it. you want a good cd go get all eyes on me that was a good 2 pac cd but this one is completely different it (is bad) majorly
1,This aint one of 2pac's best albums,"This aint one of 2pac's best, I think they could have done better than this because I KNOW 2pac had better unreleased songs than are on this album. This album reminds me of 2pac's early work, like back in 1990. The beats on this album just aren't that good."
2,Disappointing,"There was a reason this material was never released. But someone feels like making more money so here's another 2Pac album. With the exception of a couple of tracks, the rest should have never seen the light of day. With each release after his death (except the Makaveli album) I realize that 2Pac was an average MC at best and that drama can sell alot more albums than lyrics as 2Pac probably knew before his untimely death. This album is uninspiring and shows how limited he was when it came to lyrics. Only buy this album to see the pictures inside because it was the best part."
1,same old song,this sounds down right bad.nothing special.same old 2pac type of material.2nd tier material.it's only for cult fans and not very inspired.
5,"This album is like the ""Ghetto Bible"" or somethin'.","It addresses many different subjects.The one thing that makes this album one of the tightest I've ever heard is the fact that it educates you and teaches you so much. It helps you make it through the day.It teaches young kids that dreams do come true. It teaches you that roses do grow from concrete. It teaches me that you can be born to a mother without having a father around, shift from homeless shelter to homeless shelter, grow up in poverty, have to hustle at the age of 19, get beaten by police officers for jaywalking, etc. and still make it in life."
3,"Not Bad, But Not So Good...","I thought the last three Tupac albums released before and immediately after his death were his very best work. All Eyez on Me, Makaveli, and Me Against the World are all hip-hop classics to me, and I thought R U Still Down? was very weak. Still I Rise is better than RUSD, but it can't touch the other three. Most of the productions on Still I Rise are generic and forgettable and there is far too much of the Outlaws-who are on every song-and not nearly enough of Tupac. Some of the productions, like the Timbaland-ripoff remix of Hell 4 A Hustler are downright terrible, a shame since H4AH contains what I think were Pac's best verses on the album-rugged and raw, reminiscent of Ambitionz Az A Ridah or Bomb First. I'm sure all the big Pac fans like me will want to have it, but let's just say that this album really adds nothing to his legacy. An okay album, but when you're talking about one of the greatest rappers ever, that's a disappointment."
4,THIS IS ALSO FOR MISTERMAXXXX,"You have alot of nerve to dis my dogg PAC and to actually even think that puff daddy is a better M.C. than TUPAC that has to be the stupidest thing I have ever heard,if you are a puff daddy,biggie,jay-z,mob deep,nas fan or whatever it is you listen to thats cool but please don't make stupid remarks about my dogg or else I will hit em up,THUG IN PEACE PAC.Row Dogg from da dpgc"
2,Wack beats...,"I like all of 2Pac's records. Except for this one. I have heard most of the ""bootleg"" versions of the songs on this record, but Afeni decided to make it all ""jiggy & cool"" sounding so now it sounds like a Mase record. There isn't one rugged & raw beat on the album. They all sound so Bad Boy-esque. This is an atrocity of a 2Pac album.Just get Rakim's new one instead."
1,Album wasn't interesting all at,"i listened to this album a was right, it was not interesting. The outlaws which was Pac's crew made the album die with their styles and they still need to inprove in their skills especially the producers of this album cause the quality is very bad and I wonder why they made this album? i hope Dr.Dre doesn't know of this cause they will need Dre to help them produce a good album but Tupac disrespected Dr.Dre so i guess not"
1,not so good...,I was told this album was good and when i bought it was was dissapointed at all the failed raps and the music quality was really bad...I really could understand why they release an album that was so slow but that's what I felt.
1,Tupac's Down Fall?,"Tupac's latest album, ""Still I Rise"" fails to keep Tupac's music alive for the '99. There are no real cuts off the album that could shine and give Tupac some play time on the radio..In addition, the amateur skills of the Outlawz take alot away from Tupac's lyric's. The album has it's moments with Highspeed, and Letter to the President, but as far as releashing such albums as ""All EYEZ ON ME"" or ""MAKAVELI"", the producer's must be waiting for 2000 to releash something good. If anyone agree's this album will fade, and the only thing we will go back to his songs off ""ALL EYEZ ON ME"". This can't be the downhill of Tupac's work"
3,Tupac delivers again with messages,Tupac has so much to say and messages for us to ponder of the world we live in and with whom...messages relevant today.
4,4.5 Stars,"I like this especially that song baby dont cry, and others but Baby dont Cry is my favorite solid Cd without the live Pac I would add this to my 2pac collection if I didnt have it."
4,good,"The first half of the disc is really good but it fades into only being okay. There five very good songs: sill i rise, secretz of war, baby don't cry, homeboyz, and the very best song on the disc HELL FOR HUSTLER."
5,kill's review,"still i rise is a awsome cd not only does it have 2pac on it it has a great group named the outlaws my favorite songs are letter to the president, still i rise, and the good die young buy this cd"
5,WEST COAST DON IS BACK!,THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM OF THE YEAR FORGET B.I.G FORGET JZ THIS IS THE ALBUM OF THE YEAR2 PAC 4 EVER WESTSIDE 4 LIFE!
5,A MUST NEED!,"First of all 5 stars isn't enough for this album. ""Still I Rise"" is great from the start and every song has a meaning behind it. That's what I love so much about 2Pac because his lyrics actually have background and every song has tight beats. You can flow to this album all day long and not get sick of it. Hell 4 a Hustler is probably the best song, then The Good Die Young, and Teardrops and Closed Caskets. Every song is good on this album and if you're a tupac fan then you need this CD."
3,I give it 3 1/2 starz,"This album is nice, but it isnt TRU Pac. The Outlawz help im on some songz but on others they make Pac look like he is not the Greatest Rapper of all Time. I know this review will get criticized, and if u love Pac like me then get it, but if u r just getting into Pac get an older release such as All Eyez on Me or Greatest Hits."
3,not his best,"the reason this isn't his best is that there is not enough 2pac and to much outlawz. there are only 5 songs on this cd that is worth listening to and that's (1) letter to the president, (2) secretz of war, (3) black jesus, (4)hell for a hustler, and (5) tatoo tears. i think that the cd could have been a lot better and i hope he comes out with another cd soon, but this time only with him. another thing is that some of the beats have been changed from his bootleg version and there are added lyrics by him and the outlawz."
5,The Realest More then Music,"Most of you are aware at the talent and the legend that is 2pac, Makaveli and with Still I Rise you witness the continuation of Pac's legacy. The Outlawz dont dissapoint and show the Rap world they are here to stay and are not your average rappers. Despite the absence of fatal, and the remastering of some songs the album is tight as hell. Still I Rise is an incredible track, the same could be said about Killuminatti, The Good die Young and U can be Touched. What makes this album great and most people fail wont realize is this album shocases pac Thuggedout riddin on his foes, pac's deep religeous thoughts war themes revolutionary movements and more. Unfourtanetley kadafi death leaves a mark on it all as he was a great talent who we did not get much chance to hear. The Outlawz show the will carry Pac's legacy by following his themes, and starting the new era ridding for pac by taking shots at No Limit, bad Boy and the untalented dmx. mkaveli is the realest. enough said."
5,???,"great album...except for that group of damned idiots called the outlawz. they are so irritating. they haven't a good voive, their lyrics suck..and yet they steal 1/2 sometimes even 3/4 of the space on a tupac's song. they are truly disgusting. the only thing they did do well was exploiting tupac to make their own fame.only reason it's a good album is because of the few verses tupac did get to say..."
2,its not as good,this cd was really a waste of my money.the outlawz aren as good as juniormafia all the outlawz cd dont compare to the 1 juniormafia album ppl give the outlawz to much credit
4,Down South Playas still comin up !,"Yo, all yall need to check dis cd out. Just like all the new south rappers, Pookie is tight. The best track is Crook 4 Life. Also check out Big Pokey, Coco Budda, and the other South rappers. Peace"
3,Pookie is tight .. i wont lie,"Imma Indiana kat and basically a underground head ( hieroglyphics , el-p , gm grimm , mf doom ect. ) but this cd seems to be circulating around indy . i heard it a couple yrs ago and still bump it every now n then . This is what project music is about . imma say tracks 2 and 13 are alone are worth having this cd. Peace amazon kids.."
5,Everything into one,"I'm usually not someone who would listen to this but I found an EP by this band and I enjoyed the name of the band so i got it. The first time I listened, I really didn't know what to call this. Is it hardcore, is it experimental, indie, what is it? It just amazed me the depth that this band has. It can start very hard and metal sounding to this beautiful landscape of melodies and harmonies flowing over you. the best way i can put it is sigur-ros mixed with umphrey's mcgee mixed with metallica, i really can't think of anything better to compare them to. you have to check them out for yourselves to understand."
2,Helmet not so great,The price is cheap enough at $29.99. The helmet fits high on the head and the visor is not usefull because of its small size. I would not purchase again although I would use it as a spare.
2,Not satisfied. Looks like a horse jockey helmet.,This helmet is not esthetically pleasing at all. It sits high on my head making it look like I'm about to go horse riding. This is not just my opinion but most of the guys and girls I ride motorcycles with. It is comfortable and is not hot during the summer heat. I took the visor off to improve the look and by chance it made the helmet fit better while riding; the visor kept lifting the helmet up off my forehead.
4,Good brain bucket,I bought this item due to it's economical price tag and because it fit the color and size requirements I desired. The item was shipped quickly and I am very pleased with the comfort and fit.
5,Love this helmet,"I love the look and feel of this helmet: it's slightly vintage/retro, but the most important thing is that it's functional and comfortable. Looking for a scooter helmet, this is a great one!FIT: I'm a 5'8"" female, and the helmet gives me a little room. (I'm not sure if anyone can extrapolate height to head size, but I'm not sure of the dimensions of my head!)"
4,Satisfied customer.,"Helmet came relatively fast. It was packaged securely. Took it out of box, threw it on and got on my Metro scooter. Fit to size. Light helmet and zero bubble head look. I would say helmet is good for local roads, speeds under 35mph, ears and chin exposed, hence 1/2 helmet."
3,dorman 264-403,"oil pan look ok not oem quality, interior has rusted spots,I do not rec.it can get oem for the same money [...]."
3,Jet Propulsion Books,"Book is fine, however I ordered on 17 books on September 19. I am still waiting to receive 9. The vendor told me that they would have all books in three weeks. I accepted this statement, understanding that the class that started October 6 would have to wait. Class is over and they are still waiting."
5,Zondervan KJV Study Bible,"Excellent study Bible. Filled with loads of information on each book, helping you to better understand the nature of each book."
5,A great review of many branches of Yoga,"This is an amazing book. Very precise and very well written. An excellent book to practice Yoga. Actually, the best book on Yoga I've seen so far!"
2,AMAZON service,"This review is not about the product (I have not received it yet) but about the Amazon service itself.When saying I have not received it yet, I am not entirelly correct. I did received the box, with the jewelry box inside. The problem was that when I opened the jewelry box, there was nothing inside! That is correct, it was empty! My guess is someone in the wharehouses took it from the box before shipping it, but I will never know... The worst thing was that this was supposed to be a gift for my wife for Christmas.Now, the Amazon service was kind enough to try to re-send it as soon as they could, but it will not arrive before tommorrow, which is Dec. 27, way after Christmas! Hope THAT box will have something inside (don't hold my breath though). Arrrrrgh!"
3,"Same Old, Same Old","I'm a Harlan Coben fan. I've read all his books, the Myron Bolitar stories as well as his latest endeavors. He's always a fun read. But by the time I got to ""The Innocent,"" I felt like Coben was reaching into the same bag of tricks over and over. There's the secret identity ploy, the ""turn your cel phone to mute"" gag, the loving family in Jersey throughline, the random martial arts moments... Don't get me wrong. It's an entertaining book. But at this point, I think Coben needs to expand his (and our) world."
5,Enjoy,"Loved this book. It keeps the attention and although there are many ""coincidences"" and close escapes from death it makes for good reading. The characters were fully fleshed out as well. It is a page turner, but one with real writing quality. It's my first Coban book and I will definitely be reading others."
3,Great plot idea wasted by a preposterous finish...,"What a bipolar work. The setup and pacing are terrific, but the ""rousing conclusion"" was a major letdown, marred by a ""can I top the last incredible plot conceit with an even more bizarre twist"" approach that's almost laughable. Too bad, since there was a very good book in the making here."
3,Almost good,I agree with reviewer Anne Masterson in her summary thatit entertained for about three quarters of the book andthen collaped into some unrealistic hook-ups that didn'tmake much sense and were not believable. I have readall of his books and always look forward to his latest.
1,Used to be a big fan,"I've read all of Harlan Corben's books and thought they were witty, imaginative and a great read. My husband & I picked up the unabridged audio CD version for a long drive this week. It was so awful we stopped listing to it and tried the AM stations. Very disappointing. The plot wasn't bad but the dialog was awful and rehashed the same thing from 2 or 3 perspectives. It was like he added about 200 pages of superfilous dialog to make up the word count."
2,Something is missing,"I can tell you that the main plot is thrilling. The problem is where you can find it. The book goes out of the main story so many times that you almost forget what you're reading. The book's end lacks in wits, HC just got out of ideas and finished the book like a fairy tale: Everybody found what they wanted and lived happily ever after. That's not the way to finish this book because this book has a potential to a paramount end no matter if it's merry or not.Query: Which were the good guys?"
3,"Interesting thriller, too many branches","Others have done an adequate job of rehashing the plot, so I won't waste your time.I will, however, say that I'm giving my opinion as someone who isn't already a Harlan Coben fan. This is my first Harlan Coben book. I enjoyed parts of it, but most of the time, trudging through the book felt like a task.Coben grabs the reader's attention right away, seizing them at the very first chapter. He ends the first several chapters with little cliffhangers, and it makes you want to go on. And then the story branches. 100 pages later, you don't know any more than you knew when you started.However, if you don't mind a story that digresses from the main plot (again, and again, and again), then you'll probably enjoy this. I did... to an extent."
4,The Innocent,"Suspensful book. The storyline, however, is similar to Gone For Good, down to the missing daughter. Details vary, however, I believe Mr. Coben used the same template twice."
4,A Complex and Satisfying story,"I enjoy all of Coben's novels and I enjoyed this one too. He has created a maze of a story, with many plot twists and surprises. The characters, as always, are carefully and thoughtfully drawn. Which brings me to my only complaints...a few too many twists and a lot of inner monologue.Overall, though, the book is satisying and I read it in one evening. Coben is a master story teller and his people are so real, so much like people you know in everyday life. I appreciate that. He knows his craft and even if this isn't one of his best, it's still ranked way up there.The Rose Killer"
4,Fast-paced thriller,"Having read Tell No One and No Second Chance, I was anxious to read The Innocent. I finished it in one sitting. It was fast-paced with lots of twists and turns. Just go with it and you won't be disappointed. A good way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon."
2,"Started out as a 5-star thriller, ended as a 2-star snoozer","The first 25 or 30 chapters, Coben had me. Not that his writing is really notable or even that great, but he is a master of drawing you in, then as each chapter ends, he reveals another tiny part of the mystery to propel you in to the next chapter.That's the good news. The bad news is that this novel basically fizzles out about half way through. Improbable character motivations, unrealistic law enforcement situations, and the ultimate no-no, a convoluted plot that crashes and burns in the end.I really wanted to like this book but the unbelievable writing ultimately sinks it."
2,The Confused,"This book started out to be interesting, and then halfway through - became a little muddy, and towards the end - completely confusing. You will need to create a flow chart to keep up with the jagged plot.There are so many characters who are introduced without going into depth, that I kept wondering who each one was, and what was his/her part in the story. I realize it is only a novel, but it went from being somewhat believable to sounding more like a story that a first-grader would spin - it just became more ridiculous and silly.I realize that most of Mr. Coben's fans disagree with my rating, but I like a book - even a novel - to have some semblance of reality."
2,CONFUSING AND TOTALLY UNBELIEVABLE!,"I have to agree with reader/reviewer,""Confused"", that you need a flow chart to keep track of the characters and their doings in this book. I liked the first 2/3 of the book, but then the plot started branching all over the place. The motives of the characters weren't clear to me, and there were so many poorly developed characters that I couldn't keep their stories straight. Even though I took extra care to read slowly and comprehend, when I was done with the book, I couldn't tell you who did what--nor did I really care anymore. I have read thousands of books of this genre through the years, but this one just got ridiculous. I've read Coben's other books with enjoyment. I realize that this is not the popular opinion of this book, but it's mine."
4,Haunted pasts,"One squeeze too hard on the throat of another college student, was all it took to ruin the life of Matt Hunter, a 20 year old student, who was involved in a fatal bar room brawl. Matt was sent to jail for 4 years, completely altering his life, his prospects and his plans to become a lawyer. After meeting and marrying his lovely wife, Olivia, everything seemed to go wrong:just as they discover that Olivia is pregnant, vile photos, seemingly picturing Olivia with another man, appear on Matt's cell phone. Olivia reveals her rather sordid past to Matt and then their world collapses with murders, beatings and threats to involve Matt with other crimes, because of his past record and involvement with a pair of crooked FBI men. A major part of the story takes place in Reno and is connected with a team of erotic dancers with whom Olivia was formerly entangled. The ending became a tad too busy for my taste, but I still give the book 4 stars for an entertaining read."
4,a well executed thriller but ... haven't I seen this all before?,"'The Innocent' seems to classic Harlan Coben material. That is, it is a well crafted thriller with many plot twists and an almost incomprehensible ending. Yes, lots of murder and mayhem. Fine characterizations and silky smooth prose. But after gobbling down these 500 pages in no time I sense it was nothing more than empty calories. Although better written than most, it's a beach/travel sort of read. The book also feels like a derivative of almost every other paperback mystery found on supermarket shelves. After all, how many ways can you spin the ""wife has a secret"" shtick without it appearing contrived?Bottom line: the words go down easy but you'll forget all about 'The Innocent' in no time. Enjoyable mystery without taxing the brain."
5,Harlan Coben is a Great Writer,I loved this book. The plot and characters were great. The twists and turns were enough to keep me turning page after page after page. I could not put it down.
5,Great Book,I love Cobens books and this is no exception. Loved it. It has alot of twists and turns and excitment..
2,Not a good example of a Harlan Coben novel,"I have read almost every Coben novel. With The Innocent, I found that I lost interest about one half way through and by the three quarter mark, I really didn't care what happened to the main characters. I found the main character naive and his wife a constant boor. The plot was convoluted and certainly not plausible. It was though Coben tried to fill up space with loads of unnecessary twists. I finally finished it but was exhausted from the struggle. I'll continue to read this author, however and hope for the best."
2,Too many tangents,"The book starts like gang busters and grabs your attention. Then, as you keep reading chapter after chapter, Coben goes off on tangents that quite frankly don't add a lot to the story. I found myself doing a lot of skimming to get back to the story of Matt and Olivia. In the end, the story comes to a good conclusion. But getting there -- took a lot of patience. I would not read it again knowing what I know now."
4,Entertaining,'The Innocent' was a very entertaining and suspenseful novel. The plot was intriguing though I felt it got a little weak the last couple chapters. The characters were likable.
4,Great plot,Corben does a great job of setting up the story and then having many different twists and turns through-out. While this was very well done There were probably a couple too many of these twists I was ready for the book to be done before it ended. I would still recommend this book.
4,The Innocent,"The Innocent by Harlan Coben is another fine example of this great author's storytelling mastery. Coben weaves an intricate tale of suspense that is multi-faceted and complicated, yet easy to follow all at the same time. Coben is one of the finest suspence/thriller/mystery writers in the market. The characters in this book are all very well-rounded and realized. They each have flaws, and yet that is one makes each of them all the more accessible. I rated this book four stars based on the fact that it was a fun read and a wild ride. This is a great way to spend some time. Enjoy."
4,Twists and Turns,Mr. Coben delivers again with this page turning thriller. His characters are always well drawn and his plot lines are full of harrowing twists and turns. Another enjoyable read from one of the masters of this genre.
2,An established author settles for less,"I'll start with something positive...I loved early Harlan Coben books. The characters were well drawn, dialogue sharp and the plot sizzled. This novel, however, didn't do it for me. The story was weighed down with so much backstory and needless description, I couldn't relate to or care for the characters. Budding writers are given guidlines to follow if they want to be published (weave in description, limit back story information, show don't tell...the list goes on). Coben, as a seasoned writer, pretty much breaks every rule with The Innocent. Guess the publishers let these important points slide just because he's an established writer. Don't waste your money on this one. Wait until he goes back to the basics and gets it right again."
4,Book review of The innocentby Harlan Coban,"This was my first contact with the writing of Mr. Coban, and I started reading the prologue while walking from my mailbox, into the kitchen and on to my favorite chair without lifting my eyes from the pages. The book was fast paced, interesting and had a thousand quirks and turns. I felt sorry for the protaganist, wished him luck and was happy with the final outcome. It was a book I could not put down until I turned the final page."
2,OK,A potboiler whose pace quickens and thickens only because its story stretches taut over a mindfield of plot contrivances and utterly incredible coincidences. A white-nuckle light read? Yes. Memorable mystery? No.
4,Your Angst is My Angst!,"Poor Matt Hunter! Just when he was getting his life back together his personal freedom is again in jeopardy!Harlen Coben knows how to catch you by the throat and not let go until the final sentence. Keep the Advil handy! Story is a bit convoluted, but if you read carefully, you will not lose the drift.All the way through this book, my heart went out to Matt. He endured, took a lot of hits, but survived it all. And it all begins with a drunken college party!More characters in this book that you can shake a stick at and keeping them all in order takes a lot of concentration. But it is all worth it in the end and Coben again writes one heck of a book!"
5,Harlan Does it All,"I have earlier read Harlan Coben, famous Myron Bolitar series. But, ""The Innocent"" has everything that a great book should have. Matt Hunter, an ex-con living happliy with his wife, who is expecting. And then the hell broke loose. Everything goes wrong, a nun found dead, though later found that she was not really a nun. A background search reveals things which takes the book to a different level altogether.The twists and turns in the book are good and at ease with the reader. The plot and subplots and thankfully not very complicated and handled well.All in All, a great read. Should be in everybody ""Must Read"" list."
3,"Twist, Twist, Hook, Twist=too much and too unrealistic","You are probably like me in that you love a good fiction thriller. Although this thriller is interesting and I finished it rather quickly, I found that Harlan Coben has begun to add TOO MANY hooks and twists in his novels just for the sake of trying to confuse and entertain. His older work is much better.You may find yourself confused at times with the large number of characters that you don't care about and the myriad of plot twists that are completely out of this world weird and unrealistic. I'm all for reading fiction for fiction's sake, but this one is just a bit too much. There are better thrillers out there. Especially those written by Mr. Coben himself."
2,WEAK!,I like Harlan Coben. Tell No One is a wonderful thriller. This is not. The story seemed forced and contrived. The narrator on the audio CD is HORRIBLE. I listen to a ton of audio books and this was the worst I'd heard. I'll never listen to another one he does.
4,4 1/2 stars,"Out of jail after a conviction for manslaughter (he was just trying to stop a fight), Matt Hunter suddenly finds himself suspected of multiple murders.As always, Harlan Coben provides great entertainment in his latest thriller. A fast moving, twisting thriller I was very satisfied reading.Highly recommended."
5,Coben comes up aces!!!!!,"BY FAR, THE FASTEST, MOST INTENSE THRILL FROM COBEN.....PICK UP THIS BOOK AND YOULL BE SO INTO IT, YOULL SKIP SLEEP TONIGHT TO FINISH IT."
3,A good book but an average Coben,"I'm a true fan of Coben's work. His new book is filled with suspense and the characters are attaching: an inextricable story and high risk situations for Matt Hunter and his wife...However, at the middle of the book, if you have read the previous Harlan Coben's novels, you'll guess a lot of the hidden stuff that should be high surprises... The book is good, but not as much as ""Tell no one"" or ""Gone for good"".I'd give a 4th star for the Myron Bbolitar short story at the end of the book: this bonus is a nice surprise and gave me the nostalgy of all the ""Myron and Win"" books..."
3,Everyone and their brother was out to get him,"Matt Hunter is on the run and confused. He had a good life, a secure job, a lovely wife, a baby on the way, and was closing on a new house when his life fell apart. As a young man, Matt accidentally shot a man and spent four years in prison. When he was released, he swore he would never go back to jail. Suddenly strange pictures showed up on his cell phone, a nun was murdered, and it seemed that everyone and their brother was out to get him. How could he solve the murder and clear his name?Reviewed by Janet Sue Terry, author of the contemporary romance, ""Set Me Free"" series Possibilities and Resolutions. President of Just My best Book Publishing Company. www.janetsueterry.com."
3,GOOD TILL THE END,"I was really into this book until the end. I get very annoyed when a book is exciting and suspenseful and then in the end beyond belief. My big question at the end was how did Sister Mary Rose know where the daughter was to contact her in the first place. (I had guessed who she was early on.) Maybe I missed something along the way - I did go back to see if I had, but could find nothing.I definitely enjoy Coben's style and wit. However, this is the second book I have read of his where the ending just didn't stack up to the overall book. However, I might try one more, as he is an entertaining writer."
4,A serious page turner,"A thriller that grabs you from the beginning and doesn't disappoint. Characters and situations that are gripping and engaging. Not a classic by any means, but a good fun read if you are into thrillers."
5,BEST BOOK EVER,"I loved this book. Harlan Coben is a great author and i admire him so much, but this book just blew me right out of the water. Anyone interested in any of Coben's other books SHOULD read this one. it is a must. also, he once again seems to capture the smart-mouthed characters we all seem to enjoy. Go HARLAN!"
2,Groaner,"PUH-LEEEEEEEZE!I just finished this groaner. It could not conceivably have been more contrived and convoluted. When you get to the end (if you foolishly read it all, as I did) you will let out an AUDIBLE moan of utter disbelief.If stars were awarded for ""cringe factor,"" this book would earn a ten!"
4,"Great read, very enjoyable","The Innocent is an exciting, suspenseful page-turner that succeeds at developing deep characters, a thick plot and twists and turns along the way. It was hard to put down and was only put down a few times. I recommend it to readers looking for a thrilling read. I would give it 5 stars but it throws in a few too many twists at the end that I think disrupted the flow a bit.It definitely makes me interested in Coben's other books, as this was exactly what I was looking for in a fun book."
5,"Nothing more, nothing less than TRUE SOUND","I've bought this headphones for the sole purpose of mixing my band's live performances, but I ended up carring it with me everywhere I go. Sure it is not the best definition of portable, but boy, it sounds like no other! If you're not one of those overbass fans, if you ever get the chance, try it with a song you're very used to listen. It will sound like a whole new song, much more detailed! Real flat, well-defined in all ranges, its resolution is amazing - the midrange reproduction is like no other I ever tried. It is also very comfortable and well built. The only thing I don't really like about it it is its cord - a little bit too long. But since it is replaceble, it is not exactly a problem."
5,Amazing headphones,"Other people have already articulated why these are great headphones and I have no new reasons to add. That said, I want to point out that I spent a great deal of time researching headphones before buying these. They truly live up to all expectations as an incredible sounding sealed, comfortable pair of headphones.Though I prefer semi-open, the place I use them most is the office. Unfortunately that combined with enjoying a lot of hip hop (including gangster rap) means sealed was the only realistic way to go for me. These are one of the best!"
5,Great,These headphones will rock your world! Love the automatic mute feature when the headphones are taken off your head.
4,Satisfied with purchase,"Overall, we have been very happy with this humidifier. We purchased it after searching for a warm mist humidifier that held more than a gallon of water. We use it for approximately 4 months a year and we are on our third season with this unit. It does it's job very well and a tank lasts about half a day during the winter as opposed to the smaller ones where we were having to refill several times each day. We have had two minor issues 1. After you refill the tank and place it back on the unit it does not always start working immediately, sometimes you have to turn the unit off and back on again, but it is not a big deal. 2. It is hard to find the filters in stores, but we ordered them from one of Amazon's sellers and we received them very quickly."
2,Newer is not better,"Had another version of the Honeywell QuickSteam and loved it. Other version had little pads that collected the mineral deposits, really extending the time between needing to shut the unit down to soak in vinegar for cleaning. This version doesn't have the pads and is much the worse for it."
2,Fair,I purchased two of these humidifiers in December -- One is still workingthe other one seems to have noHoneywell HWM450 Quick Steam Warm Moisture Humidifierelectrical connection. My husbandtested it with an electrical testing device..... It costs $10.00 pluspostage to send it back. I'm hoping the other one stays working andwe can use the faulty one for parts. I don't believe in paying even$10.00 plus postage to have something fixed that is less than six months old. I like the warm steam but would not purchase this again bymail. A brick and mortar store would take it back and replace it at nocost.
1,Mine started leaking all over the place,"My humidifier worked for a season, then started leaking all over the place. I would not recommend."
3,Good machine,"It seemed to be an ok machine just did't work right, did not get another one, did not wast the hassle"
1,Do not buy,"I bought it early 2012, and just unpacked it for 2013 season, only to find it had disintegrated inside. So it lasted just one season."
1,The worst consumer item I've ever bought,"My humidifier lasted exactly 1 night before it started leaking. Despite the surface being level, the humidifier is discharging too much water and it's coming out of the sides. Wish I had looked the model up first. I don't think I'll even bother contacting the manufacturer. I'm going to take a baseball bat to this thing and reclaim some satisfaction that way. Cannot wait to destroy it."
3,Honeywell hwm330,"Good unit but large opening to fill with water does not seal well. It takes 3 or 4 times to get it to stop leaking, all the small cap units work just fine. That is why I gave it less than 5 stars."
1,"Poor design, premature failure","Clearly a lot of people have had problems with this unit. When mine failed after about 6 weeks of use, I dug into it to see what was up. It ends up that the overheat protection on this thing isn't real great. The first layer of overheat protection is provided by a sensor integrated into the heating element. I can't tell exactly, but it seems from the element manufacturer's literature (....) that the device sends a cut off signal between 250 and 300 C, per the chart on page 4. However, Honeywell used an NEC-Schott SF214E thermal cutoff as a backup device. This fails permanently if it's heated to 214 C. In other words, the backup, ""sacrifice the machine and not the house it's in"" device fails before the normal operation re-settable thermal cutoff. As a result, the device will probably stop working the first time it runs dry. Don't buy it."
1,"A good product, but suffers from a fatal flaw","I bought a new Honeywell Quicksteam (HWM-330) several months ago from a local store, to help keep our bedroom at a comfortable humidity. The humidifier worked well enough, but less than a week after we had been using it, the unit wouldn't turn on again the morning after we used it.We suspected the problem was that the unit burned out after having used up its water supply during the night. To their credit, Honeywell sent us a brand new unit after we sent the broken one back to them. But once again, the new unit died after running out of water overnight, less than a week after we had received our second unit.It would be one thing if they had advertised the unit as NOT having an auto shut-off feature. In that case, we never would have purchased it; however, we've had two units die after less than two weeks of CUMULATIVE use, and for the same reason. As such, I strongly recommend AGAINST purchasing this humidifier."
1,"Worked for one season, then died","I would have given this NO stars if I could have. This humidifier seemed to work well for about 6-8 months-- we used it for a couple of weeks at a time when colds struck someone in our household, only in the evenings. Then, the unit just stopped working. I can get the lights to turn on, as if it is about to work, but no steam emerges. After going through 2 different models of these modern, automatic shut-off steam humidifiers, I give up. I'm going back to the old school version my parents used when I was a kid. It wasn't pretty, but one humidifier work throughout my entire childhood."
3,Lasted a winter and a half,"This was a great humidifier, really cranked out the moisture, quiet, nice system of dealing with mineral buildup (using mineral filters). Got this last winter and had been using it 3 months this winter. Last night the lights went out. It's dead.I'm tempted to get another. If it costs me $20 every other winter for shipping & handling to return - it might be worth it. I've disliked every humidifier I've ever had and they all break down eventually. I think I'll try for another and ask them to wave the warranty fee."
4,Getting Better....,"I ordered a HWM331 3 weeks ago. It worked pretty well the first night. But the 2nd day after I pulled the water out and cleaned it, it stopped working!! No light, no sound, no nothing. I was scared and started thinking of all the bad reviews on this website. But I love its white pretty design and really don't want to lose it.I tried to tear it apart and put it together again and again for 30 minutes. Magically.....it worked again! After that, I used it every night and never have problems any more. I was so happy that I save it back. It's quiet, functioned well and pretty. I never feel thirsty in the midnight or wake up with dry throat. I love this product."
2,not easy to fill,"The humidifier works well. It takes a few days of adjusting both dials to get the humidity set to the desired level. At first it will go through the water like crazy, but once you get it set right, it uses less. My only complaint and the reason I returned this is the tank is awkward to fill. The cap is on the underside, so after you fill it, it needs to be turned upside down to screw the cap on. The problem with that is the top of the tank is curved, so you need to make sure to hold it otherwise it will fall and spill. It is also heavy since it holds so much. I prefer theVicks UV 99.999% Germ Free Humidifier. It does cost more, but I think it is worth it. It has two tanks that hold a comparable amount of water in total and they are flat on the top so they can be set down when filling."
2,Great.... when they work..........,"I've had 2 of these already - in the past few years. And when it 'works' it's great. BUT, I always ended up with it failing to work/start seemingly due to electrical sensors/contacts (i.e. it would not turn on).I don't want to have to buy a new one every 2 years..............."
1,Defective after 2 weeks,Purchased this product and it was defective after 2 weeks. Still waiting on Kaz Incorporated (the manufacturer's reseller) to refund my money or send me a replacement product. Please do not purchase this product!
4,Works great!,"This replaces a older model but the older model was digital setting. I liked the digital better , but can't get any more. This works just fine though. Will run all night on low & part of the day."
4,4.5 stars,"This is great music, it's Brazilian, there are upbeat shake your body tunes and some more melancholy tunes. I heard the soundtrack first, bought it, and then I watched the movie that this is a soundtrack too. Um, it wasn't a bad movie, but it was odd. Me, You, Them. A woman who has very little marriage prospects marries an older man when he asks because she has no hopes for anything better. His neighbor falls in love with her. She falls in love with a field hand she works in. It's quite a love square. But the soundtrack is very good, I keep it in my car."
4,a must-read for anyone interested in the Vietnam War,"Albert French writes not only from the perspective of an American fighting in Vietnam, but also as an African-American, a view which is often neglected. I read this book for a college history course, and never before has an assigned text moved me to the point of tears. This book brings to life a time and place that many of us know little about. Though French obviously cannot, nor does he attempt, to speak for all Vietnam veterans, his story does offer an example of the long term effects of that period of time."
4,Out of the Darkness,"I fell in love with ""Billy"" and with ""Holly"" and French continues his exciting work with ""Patches of Fire."" I was expecting a story similar to his earlier work, and soon realized that this was going to be something different. A man who has found the strength and the means to share not only his horrific experiences of war but also his fellow soldiers. French's raw and at times conflicting narrative grip the reader with the same pain and torment with which he has been living with since the war. French has let us into a world that few can ever imagine. His story has allowed him to share his burdened conscience with his readers. The one that won't let him forget the smiles and the hopes and dreams of all these young men that perished needlessly. ""Patches of Fire"" is not simply a story of redemption for French, he is also redeeming the memory of his fallen comrades"
2,Ink goes too quickly,"The ink, and the printer it goes into, works ok. The problem is that the ink gets used up too quickly, so the lifetime cost of using this ink with an associated printer is VERY high. Even printing black text soaks up some of the other colors of ink. Buy a printer that uses this ink only if you have deep pockets."
5,Perfect,"Perfect product. Easy to use. Quick shipping. Decent price. Don't think twice, if you need this for your Canon printer, don't hesitate to buy, go for it!"
3,WELL . . .,"WORKS GREAT, BUT WHY DOES IT COST SO MUCH? IT'S AS IF CANON SELLS THEIR PRINTERS CHEAP SO THEY CAN SCREW US IN THE INK. AND I'VE TRIED REFILL INK KITS AND STAPLES' REFILL, BUT FOR SOME REASON THE QUALITY ISN'T VERY GOODS."
3,It's ink...,"...and it does the job it's supposed to do. I let the old cartridge go a long time after it first told me it needed replacing - and I'm glad did. Eventually, it stopped printing with a much sterner warning and that's when I finally replaced the cartridge.It's a little unnerving when the people who make a living selling new ink cartridges are the ones who decide when the old one is empty. And, to be honest, the old one looked like it still had more ink in it - but what can you do? I still question how running out of ink completely can ""damage the printer"" and ""void the warranty""."
1,Two defective cartridges!!!!,I recently ordered two of these and both were defective. Its evidently not a good idea to buy print cartridges via the internet.
5,Happy I bought a multi-color cartridge printer!,"It's such a money-saver, not having to replace a color cartridge just because a certain color is empty. But this black cartridge lasts through hundreds of basic sheets of printing. I have been printing house fliers and haven't run out of black color, yet. The standard black cartridge is 2-3 times the size of a color cartridge, which is very nice since black is the color you use most often. These are good quality, I've yet to have a ink leak with any that I've purchased, and the color goes on well, with no leaking, streaking or getting dried up. It's also cheaper on amazon than buying them at the store."
2,Not what I expected.,"August 7, 2009 - UPDATEI have printed several pages since my first review and I am happy to report that the prints using the black inks have looked much better. At the quality that I am receiving now, I would purchase these cartridges again. I have used the cyan and yellow inks as well and have not had a problem with them.===============I received these in the mail. They were individually wrapped GENERIC cartridges. So were the colored ones that I ordered from the same company. This is not what is pictured. I opened one up today and the ink leaked all over my hands (Perhaps I squeezed it when I took off the plastic piece). Anyway, I cleaned the cartridge up and placed it in my printer. (I made sure it was no longer leaking first.) The print quality is not nearly as good as the original. I am definitely disappointed in my purchase."
4,works,Unfortunately my Canon MP830 will only use Canon cartridges which are expensive. having said that I love my Canon all-in-one.
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed to discover that this cartridge is not recognized in my Canon MP600, despite what the product description says. Will definitely not order from this company again. Waste of time and money!"
5,Nothing beats Canon quality,"It would be nice if the generics worked as well as the Canon originals, but they don't. There is never a problem with these ink cartridges, so I guess it makes them worth the money."
5,Great Price and FAST shipping!,"This ink was just as good as any other Canon PGI-5 BK, but much cheaper. I ordered it on a Tuesday, and it arrived at my house on that Thursday, with the FREE shipping! Great service for a great price."
5,Canon PGI-5 BK 2-Pack ink,Canon PGI-5 BK 2-Pack ink cartridge is very easy to install and works very well. The black prints out very black.
5,My experience,Amazon provided excellent & speedy service at a very competitive price. I highly recommend them as a source for printer inks.Bill Robinett
1,Generic Brand,"I thought what I was getting was a Cannon product and found out it was a generic brand when I recieved it. It is working OK, however got ink all over my hand when I went to install."
3,canon PGI-5-2 pack pigment,"A good product, easy to install. The only draw back with this printer is the cost of the replacement ink."
2,Wish I could find a better way...,The price you pay for ink is so high and they make it close to impossible to buy non oem tanks. Amazon seems to have the best price though and they make ordering easy.
5,Consistently Good Product,I have ever had a problem with Canon ink ... I love the Canon all-in-one printer. The inks have been a consistently good product.
4,OVERPRICING BY CANON-NOT AMAZON-REFLECTS IN RATING,"WHY CAN'T CANON AND OTHER MFGS.PRICE THEIR GOODS SO THAT THE CONSUMER WOULD WANT TO PATRONIZE THEIR PRODUCT, RATHER THAN FEEL THAT WE ARE TRAPPED INTO A GREED-DRIVEN PRICING SCHEDULE? TO IT'S CREDIT, AMAZON HAS MY BUSINESS, GOOD DISCOUNTED PRICES AND THE AMAZON PRIME FREE 2-DAY SHIPPING ---AND---NO TAX TO PAY.BUT UNTIL CANON, IN THIS CASE, UTILIZES A MORE CONSUMER FRIENDLY PRICING SCHEDULE, I WILL DEDUCT A STAR FOR THEIR ATTITUDE."
4,good buy,"this is a decent buy for the money.I would like to be able to get all the colors for the same low price, however."
4,"Great quality, but overpriced","These canon inks provide perfect reults evertime. Unfortunately, however,these inks seem to be so overpriced for the number of pages each tank can produce, that you feel like you have been scammed each time you print out a few pages.If I could find a reliable ink to use instead of canon's own product, I would consider giving it a try.Concerning Amazon's pricing, I consistantly find Amazon to be among the most competitive. Amazon is a good place to shop on line. Thanks"
5,great product,I like getting canon ink. The box was in good shape. I received it within the week. I like it.
5,Great Deal!,"I was bummed when I first recived this item, because I thought I had ardered the wrong thing. But it turns out it is a 2-pack, for less than one in the stores! AWESOME!"
1,Not a 2-pack as described,I ordered this and received a single cartridge package. The package bar code hada new bar code label on it that said it was a 2-pack. It could be a scam. Not sure yetbut it is a big hassle to not get the right merchandise. Buyer beware!
4,Good Service,"Since I have not yet used the product, all I can say was the service was and it appears to a legitimate Canon product."
1,Wrong recommendation,"Amazon recommended Canon PGBK-5 ink for my new Canon Pixma 620 printer. I ordered it from Amazon, and the ink came from Antonline. It wasn't until I had already opened the package and tried to install the ink that I realized it was the wrong size (too big). Antonline wouldn't accept a return because the package had been opened. Be warned - if you want to buy black ink for the Canon 620 printer, the correct ink is PGBK - 220."
4,Good Product - But,Good product.....but....I hate the fact that Canon charges so much for these tanks and has made it impossible for 3rd parties to provide OEM tanks. Do you realize how much they are charging for a gallon of ink!?! Around $1500! A good gallon of ink runs around $100. Thanks for Amazon for selling to us at a discount which is less than you can get locally.
3,It works and looks great but not affordable,"I like my canon MP610 I have had few issues with it, actually none that I can remember now especially compared to the HPs Ive worked with. Anyway this Ink is great but like all ink it is outrageously expensive and while you can push it to print more than it wants to it still seems like this ink is used up faster than ink from other printer brands and still costs the same or more"
4,Good price for Canon Printer Ink,"Better price than I would have gotten at Staples...and I didn't have to drive there and pay local taxes.Costco prices are actually better, but they package the wrong black ink for my Canon printer."
4,Computer Ink,I was in need of an ink cartridge in a hurry. I recieved the Canon PGI-5BK 2PK in great time. The speed of delivery was better than I expected. Thank you so much.
5,"Great Product, Great Price","Perfect--price, time to delivery, and product. Why go anywhere else? Nothing could've been better. #1 place to go!!"
5,Great product at great price,Buying this item was a very smooth process and it was delivered within a few days of the order.
5,Good Price fast service,"Best price I can find for this cartridge that is ""in stock"" and will ""ship quick"" shipping with my Amazon Prime. I like the honesty of Amazon and do a shop here often."
3,It's Ink,Hey lest face it all the big printer companies have monopoly on their ink. We are forced to comply in order to continue living our lives in harmony and undisrupted co-inhabitance with the world. Unfortunately the generic mock ups of these ink tanks don't cut the mustard and smear and smudge.Product Quality is great but the price isn't!
3,Not bad.,Delivery was within a week. They do not last as long as the generic cartidges though and cost more. Think I will stick with the aftermarket ones.
1,I wasn't happy with my order.,"I wasn't happy with my order, and that is why I'm giving it only 1 star. I hope they will improve."
5,"Great Product, Great Price","I have 2 Canon MP830 printers, for use at home and in my small business. Canon quality ink does make a difference in the need for cleaning/maintenance. The 2-pack is a very good value. As always, on time delivery from Amazon makes this an easy choice."
5,Genuine,"After having bad experience with no name brand ink, I prefer to stick with genuine Canon ink. This company is timely and accurate with all my shipments. Many thanks! Would recommend!"
4,Runs out quick,It works well. I love my MP800. I had it for over 5 years and it still prints nicely. I have used cheaper ink and that works just as well. Not worth it to buy this anymore.
4,Frequent interuptions,"Good quality product that costs TOO much. It also is a pain when it stops EVERY print for two to four weeks to tell me one of the five inks is running low. When the ink levels are varied, it feels like almost every print is interupted."
5,Better,"Great interface, easy to use, extreme sound sound control. , extreme sound sound control. , extreme sound sound control. , extreme sound sound control."
2,Creative Sound Blaster Live! 5.1 PCI Sound Card SB0200,"I used to have it years ago when I had it installed in Win98 but not too sure of its compatibility with Windows XP-SP2.Creative Sound Blaster Live! 5.1 PCI Sound Card SB0200 is one of my favorit sound card that I ever had ( old is gold lol ) and here I've placed my order once again but not sure whether it gonna work on XP-SP2, also not sure whether or not the driver is available coz Creative doesnt continue it anymore.I welcome users to write on it.thx .."
2,Could be better,"I purchased this to use as a mouse & presentation device. The laser pointer worked for all of 10 minutes, then no more. As a mouse it has some problems. I didn't want a mouse that I had to use on a surface. The roller-ball works great, but the left and right mouse buttons are above the ball and when transitioning from the ball to the buttons it's very difficult not to move the cursor. The mouse left/right buttons should be located below the ball. Other than these issues it's okay."
2,It worked well only once,"This remote presenter only worked once on my computer and since then it has stopped working. I have change the batteries, tried it in a different computer, reread the directions, etc, to no avail."
1,Bad choice,I did a bad choice in shopping this laser pointer! I had to buy another one from Logitech...
3,"Entertaining, but read like a soap opera.","While it was an entertaining book, it read more like a soap opera than a serious attempt to explain the circumstances of the sinking. I found it difficult to interpret where the facts ended and the author's interpretation began. The book presents a clear and plausible view of what precipitated the wreck, passing over the shoals. Would have liked more time on this, rather than the attempt to develop the characters on the ship which was superficial at best. Can't compare it to other books on the Edmund Fitzgerald, as it is the first one I've read on the subject. Would have liked more factual information and less human interest stories."
4,"You will re-live Nov 10, 1975","I really enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to anyone interested in the ""Big Fitz."" That ship or is it the song just simply has a way to draw your attention. To the 29 men on board. Rest in peace. You earned it."
5,My Favorite album from 1960!,"I was so excited to find this album on Amazon. The digitizing of the sound made it all come back to life for me. Ewan MacColl has an amazing voice and the harmonies with his wife Peggy Seeger (Pete's sister) are fabulous. If you don't enjoy old style Childs Ballads that go on for a long time, then this is not for you. But b/c of the harmonies, which vary from verse to verse, and the matching of the voices, these Ballads are easier to listen to than most. THe album contains a good balance of long ballads and shorter songs. THis was the album that got me started listening to this music way back in 1960."
2,Hard listen,I think Ewan has sparks of genius in his writing but I guess I'm not so enthusiastic about Ewan and Peggy singing or musical ability
1,bood sport 2,"movie did not even play on my bluray player, tried other dvd player and still did not work really upset this is the second time that i bought something and it did not play. I'm really having second thoughts about even buying movies really like to find old favorites and they don't even play not kool at all. Wish they could send me the right movie or at least shall i say a copy that will play, and be in english on all dvd players. I buy alot of films and wish something can be done to resolve this i would really be greatful. sincerly Mr. Stone"
4,Good solid work clothes,"These overalls are great. They hold up to the wrenches and screwdrivers I carry in my pockets as well as all the grease, soot and oil that they are subjected to on a daily basis. While they do shrink in length an inch or two and have lost the dark black color after a couple dozen washings, the placement of the pockets and the comfort of these overalls can't be beat. Definitely go one size longer than your actual inseam; it will shrink up."
5,Carhartt overhalls,The overalls were for my son in law for Christmas - he has had Carhartt products in the past and has never had a problem with them.
5,Typical Carhartt Quality,"Tough, rugged and dependable are the words that best describe Carhartt products to me and this product lives up to the name. Both waist and length sizing seem pretty spot on. I will enjoy them for years to come!"
5,Great buy !,Excellent buy will buy again got here right on time. Great product! The price was a lot cheaper. Than others stores
3,Sizing is an issue. Go up 2 sizes.,First pair of Carharrt Bibs. I'm happy with everything about them except the sizing. I read the other reviews and understood that they run small so I ordered a size larger than my regular pants. They barely fit before they were washed and absolutely do not fit after washing. Go up 2 sizes.
4,Matt,"I've used these for 4 years working as a sawmill electrician and they hold up better than anything else, lost the 5th star due to the ""assembled in Mexico"" though."
2,NOT U.S.A. MADE!,"I thought it was made in the U.S.A.. Material manufactured in the U.S. but ""assembled in Mexico"". This is NOT made in the United States of America."
5,"Carhartt Men's Unlined Duck Bib Overall, Black 32 X 32",The overalls were received timely and in fine condition. The recipient liked them very much. The size was exact and the product was great looking. He wears them with pride. Thank you. I highly recommend this company for excellent quality and service.
3,Just Okay,"Pros: they are tough and wick water away pretty well in damp situations, will keep you warm when it is coldCons: They cost too much, they are unlined which I wanted but they still get incredibly hot when it is only 60 degrees outside. They are tough so not very comfortable, and all the pockets they come with are too small to fit any regular size tools.These may be for you but, they are not for me. I will not be buying another pair."
1,Great quality but..........,"I ordered these one size larger than I take in Levi's or Wranglers, but they still did not fit."
4,"Nice Overalls, but long","The waist is good, but the length is too long. This is the 3rd pair that we have gotten. The first 2 the waist was too small so we kept going larger. On this pair the waist was good, but the length is now too long. They need to have more accuracy in the sizing."
4,Great bubs!,"I had a hard time finding 28"" lengths. It was in stork and shipped quickly. I think Carhartt bibs run small around the waist. My husband wears a 36"" waist pant, but we buy 40"" waist in these bibs. He wears them over his jeans and sweatshirt, so he doesn't want them too tight."
3,Order Bigger then you need,"This is the second pair that I have purchased for my husband. They are great as far as warmth and keeping him dry. However, the first pair we bought the size he wears and they were too small. We purchase the second pair one size larger in length and 2 sizes larger in waist size. This is not due to having more layers on either. He wears long johns underneith, so if u are planning to wear more then that you might want to order even larger."
2,I wear size 40 but these don't fit.,Guess my gut is bigger than a size 40 Levi or Wrangler jeans because I have to wear these with the buttons open on the sides even though I wear size 40 Levi's and Wranglers. I also don't like that fact that the straps connect to a piece that is sown on the front at a place lower that the edge of the material. So the material tends to roll inward and is uncomfortable. Bummer.
3,Another Romulan story!,"En route to the planet Risa, Geordi is kidnapped by Romulans who want to make the Klingons and the Federation bitter enemies. Rigging his visor to send his brain instructions to murder a prominent klingon, LaForge returns to the Enterprise unaware of the incident. Data senses E-band emissions aboard the ship, but will he stop Geordi in time?"
5,A great documentary,"I actually set my VCR back in 1988 to record this program on VHS tape while I was out of state on a job assignment for later viewing. I felt and still feel this documentary does justice to it's subject matter. I was very happy to find that it is available on DVD (PAL) and bought it. The entire program runs fine on my universal DVD player. Would highly recommend this DVD especially for those who like documentaries and/or ""who dunnits."""
1,warped DVD,"I received the DVD entitled 'Secret Identity of Jack the Ripper', with a notice that it had been cleaned & tested.The first two-third of the DVD played fine, but the last third kept stopping and skipping to the extent thatmost of this part was unwatchable. However, since I was mainly interested in the first half of the DVD I amkeeping it as is."
5,READ THIS BOOK!,"I bought this book at a book sale at age 10 or so because I wanted to learn to read people's minds. What I got was a challenging, mind-expanding book written in plain language.As an adult I once mentioned to my Dad that I had once had this book and how much ass it kicked. A few days later, by pure chance, he came across a copy and bought it for me. Coincidence - OR WAS IT?????Harold Sherman has an interesting perspective on the nature of mind and the universe. This book is an easy read, and it's worth reading just for the thoughts it might plant in your head."
5,Everyone Should Read,"This book is great! This book does not teach one to do parlor tricks or anything so Hollywood. This book is a great guide for understanding intuition and the importance of positive thoughts, being authentic in what you put out. Wonderful book. Glad I found it!"
5,Do you want to believe that life never ends?,"First written in 1949 Harold Sherman gives us a glimpse of life eternal and a chance to prepare for the inevitable.Whether we choose to believe in life after death, the time will come for each one of us to enter it's gate. Better to have a sense of our own being then to push aside the fears of dealing with this transformation in the future.Why not go through the steps NOW and get on with our lives?Other books for your consideration on this topic:On Life After Deathby Elisabeth Kubler-RossLife After Lifeby Raymond A. Moody Jr.Testimony of Light: An Extraordinary Message of Life After Deathby Helen GreavesIs There Life After Death?

1,Poor Information value,"I am writing a paper about SOA and read different books about it. In comparison to other books the Manager's Guide by Scott Green gives poor information about the SOA itself and talks about risks and controls most of the companies have realized centuries ago. In addition there are absurd comparisons to foreign laws, which maintain uselessness (for example a german law). I guess Scott Green has never been to Germany and doesn't know anything about Corporate Governance in Europe. I have traveled through Europe and found much better quality in leadership there and articles of most famous business magazins affirm my opinion.The book is pure greed for money."
5,prompt delivery,"It is important to receive email from seller to confirm the transaction, which he/she did. Prompt delivery. Book arrived in good condition as stated."
3,An Entertaining Short Novel,"A drastic change of pace, if you are used to the absurd stories such as ""The Nose"" and ""The Overcoat.""It was the local color, more than anything else, that captured me in this novel. Gogol brilliantly evokes the Cossack life in all its wild fanaticism. Beautiful descriptions (something I was not used to in Gogol) abound, especially of the steppes and the Cossack camp itself. These stories are about ""real men,"" with the women pushed far into the background."
4,"Still a great read, 20 years later!","I first read this book not long after it was published. I was about the same age as the kids in the book. I hadn't read it since, but for some strange reason, I picked it up off my shelf last night and read it cover to cover. I remembered so many details of the story so vividly. Twenty years after I first read it, I was surprised to find the book was still a page-turner and my heart was racing when the tornado finally hit. Even though it has scary parts, it has a great message throughout the book about looking out for your family and neighbors, and how the people you love are more important than any possessions."
3,Night of the twisters,"The book takes place on a Saturday in April the characters are Dan Hatch, Dan's mom, Dan's dad, Dan's grandma, Ryan, Arthur, and Stacey. The piont of view is first peron the theme of the story is living through a disaster and the conflict is when the tornado hit. There was a tornado warning and Dan's mom was worried that Ms. Smiley wouldn't be watching the news or she wouldn't be able to hear it because her hearing aid might be off so Dan's mom went to Ms. Smiley's house to make sure she was okay. While she was gone the tornado siren went off and Dan had Arthur go to the basement while he got his baby brother Ryan. When the torndao was through Dan realized how much his baby brother meant to him and also he realized that he saved his life."
4,Night of the Twisters,"I loved the book. It'll grab your attention so much that you'll never want to stop reading. I liked it so much I wish there was a Night of the Twisters 2! This book is most certainty going to be on my top ten best books for the year. The book is about Dan, Arthur, and Ryan being alone at Dan and Ryan's house wile a tornado decides to visit Dan's house! Will they survive the tornado? Will their house? Did their families live? If the kids survive will they reunite with their families? Find out in this book."
4,This book is wonderful!!!,A boy and his friend are home alone with his baby brother.A tornado warning is being flashed upon the television screen!!The two boys freak out they run to get the baby just before it hits!Its amazing.Try this book to see if they make it.Will his mom make it home in time?
5,Dan huddles in a shower as he listens to the twister above,This book is full of action!! I loved it!!
5,Great Book,This book will help a child understand storms better so maybe they will not be so scared when a storm happens.
2,This was an okay book. Too scary for me.,It was about a 12 year old boy and his best friend and baby brother.They pretend that the tornado is just not goning to happen but the weather channel says a tornado is going to hit ground. Dan and his best friend think thats it not going to happen but then the winds start to howl and it starts to rain and hail. Then the boys know they should have listened! Read it to see what happens to them.
4,Night of the Twisters,"The book I&#65533;m reviewing is called Night of the Twisters by Ivy Ruckman. I gave this book four stars. This book is about a boy named Dan, Arthur his friend, and their families as they try to get through a series of twisters. If you like tornadoes and exciting adventures, this is the book for you."
4,me likey!!!,I liked this book because it really expresses the feelings in Arthur and his friend . I liked also becuase it tells good information on what being in a hurricane is like. Also to the author the pictures a really amazing .They all look so real.
4,entertaing and informative,"Although I found this book to be a little unrealistically writen, i thought it was very interesting and informative. The plot and character development is extramly good and probablly the book's highest point."
5,An Excellent Resource,"This book is an excellent resource for those seeking to learn the truth about the ministry of Witness Lee. The book offers printed testimonies of five expert witnesses who testified on behalf of Witness Lee and the local churches in Alameda County Superior Court on May 28 and 31, 1985.Although the book is derived from an obvious controvery which began in the early 80's, the testimony of these five witnesses validates the sound theology of Witness Lee's ministry. Even some 16 years later, this book serves as a valuable resource for those who are seeking the truth, despite the negative contentions made by a few opposers."
3,It works...,"Cheaper material, feels very light when turning. I prefer a bulkier substance. When I was replacing this, I noticed that my old door knob that looks identical was made from solid metal. This much thinner."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"This is the most destructive book I've ever read. In order to get involved in magic donald tyson insists you have to cut off all contact from other human beings, cut yourself off from society, become complete devout in prayer and exercises, all in preparation for your 'initiation ceremony'...which is when you find out that donald tyson is a sham and all his promises of successful magic fall through. Go ahead knock yourself out."
4,A Poem for the Next Day.,"I bought this for a youth. At first he was kind of dumbfounded, then a few days later he says, ""give me a charge to write."" I state, ""write me a poem about the storm, I happen to love the storm."" The next day he had a story/poem about me and the storm. He loved it, and I received the blessing from the giving. Thanks to the Poet's handbook..."
4,breezies,"My order was fast,did not have the color i want, the service was so great, i do like the bra alot, just wish it had the wide strap"
5,Home Before the Monsoon,"This book was a fun, easy read. I was quickly engaged into the life of the main character and intrigued by the influence of his Indian culture (and all of the idiosyncrasies of it) on his life in America. Great book!"
3,"Trap works, but the bait does not","I purchased this trap because I feed my cat on the back porch and we have a lot of trouble with flies, due to her food. The liquid bait that came with the trap did not attract very many flies, but I filled the trap about halfway full of water and added a small handfull of her cat food to the water. That attracts SO many flies! It smells awful (I think worse than the stink bait that came with the trap), but it works well! The smell is also caused by the dead flies in the trap. If the bait does not work for you, try adding some dry cat food. It works wonders now!"
3,Brazilian soul music,"Ed Motta ""Ed Motta & Conexao Japeri"" (Warner, 1988)This is the first album by Brazilian soul star Ed Motta, who at the time this disc came out was still only a teenager. Motta is the nephew of the late soul/funk singer Tim Maia. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Brazilian Music Guide)"
3,It's a good rental,"It starts out kind of choppy, like a rock video with odd camera angles and shots. It makes it hard to decipher if there is someone watching, or just a fancy schmancy camera shot. But once that stops, the movie picks up pace. A few of the characters are annoying, and a few are really interesting. Nancy, the drummer, was annoying with his constant chatter about nothing. On the other hand, London, the goth bassist, was a riot with her dry, black humor. She reminds me alot of Linnea Quigley's character in Return Of The Living Dead.Not really scary, but it does offer some creepy, desolate moments.It's worth a rental or cheap purchase."
3,KILLER BAND,"AN INTRIGUING PREMISE GETS HINDERED BY SLOW PACING, ANNOYING MUSIC, AND MEDIOCRE PERFORMANCES.THE PLOT: A ROCK BAND IS BEING PICKED OFF ONE BY ONE BY AN UNKNOWN KILLER. THE SUSPECTS ARE MANY, THE IDENTITY IS A SURPRISE FOR A WHILE. OTHER THAN ELLIOTT AND JONESY, THE REST OF THE CHARACTERS ARE UNLIKEABLE AND SHALLOW. PRETTY BLOODY TOO. NOT HORRIBLE BUT NOT OVERLY IMPRESSIVE."
5,"One of the Best Hunting DVDs out on the Market!!!,","Excellent hunting dvd series, can help all hunters in new hunting adventures while saving you time and money. There are hunts from all over the world to watch and has more information than any other hunting videos. My family and I stay busy using the info. year round and I recommend this dvd series to all hunters."
3,size,this was a Christmas gift and the x large did not fit and I have been looking for a xx large.And I will send this jacket back and hopefully the company will make xx large and then my Christmas list would be completed.
4,Normal.,"I do not give five stars but is a good jacket, the truth is that it's a jacket like any other, nothing special."
4,Van Damme and Henstridge spices up the screen.,"Universal Soldier meets Species. Jean Clude Van Damme is a Russian police officer who discovers he has a dead twin brother, he never knew, he under goes his brothers identy to find the Russian Mob who killed him. He teams up with his brother's sexy girlfriend (Natasha Henstridge) to battle the Russian Mob."
3,Good!,"GOOD MOVIE! MAXIMUM ACTION, MAXIMUM THRILLS, MAXIMUM HENTSRIDGE. OH, YES!! I LIKED IT, AND THUS GIVE IT A 3 OUT OF 5. ONLY 'CUZ IT'S NOT SO SO SO GREAT!! but twill survive!"
5,Van Damme's best movie,"I am a fan of action movies, but I've found some of Van Damme's previous flicks (most notably, Knock Off), to be below average. After seeing this movie on TV, however, I was quite impressed and ended up buying it.As with most action movies, this one features a hero (Van Damme) who has to kick some butt, aided by a beautiful girl (Natasha Henstridge). The movie starts off with a pretty good car chase, followed by lots of scenes with guns firing and martial arts sequences. The plot isn't extensive -- Van Damme's character's twin brother is killed and he now assumes his twin's identity, only to be hounded by the Russian mafia and corrupt FBI agents.I've only seen the VHS version, so unfortunately I can't comment on the DVD sound and video quality. Nevertheless, this is a good standard action flick -- in my opinion, Van Damme's best movie (or at least it rivals Bloodsport), and I recommend it for any action movie fan."
1,Not even good enough to travel with,"This was my first and I am sure last book by this author.The book is filled with Cliché after Cliché, followed by such character stereotypes that it just hurts. The book managed to be worse than the books Tom Clancy puts out lately, (some of which are 'co-authored')."
4,Much better than Clancy did in teeth of the tiger,"For those who have teeth of the tiger and finished it you'll know where I'm coming from, at least in black wind it isn't all Jr. in teeth of the tiger thats all there was. I mean Clancy just killed Jack Rayan Sr. But with Black Wind both stand tall and make it a real good book."
2,Not what he used to be,"I used to preorder all of his books, but no more. Does anyone think in this post 911 age that the US military is not going to be all over a suspected site for BIO weapons? Also their Satellite system must be down, because they had to locate the terrorestst using a blimp and the Coast Guard. I thought the last book was bad, but this one is worse. By the way, can't he call his Son some other name but Dirk also? I turned this book into a nice short story by skipping about 60% of it."
1,"another waste of trees, wish I could give it a negative star","This is another one from his mill, only insert Dirk Pitt Jr a new sidekick, the plots are incredible and of course predictable, thank goodness I bought the paperback at a discount so I didn't feel raped by the publisher. Cussler, give us a break, stop writing this trash. When you teamed with DuBrul it least it was something different, this is just your same trash regurgitated."
2,"One word......""DUD""","I bought the book because I have read most of the earlier novels from Cussler and loved them. But this book falls far short of the standard set by the earlier novels. I had to force myself to finish reading the whole book. The writing in places was terrible, almost amateurish in style and substance. There were many places where there were technical mistakes in the operation of simple machines such as a camp stove for one. Other mistakes in aircraft structure, assualt team tactics and others. I will say that the premise of the story was a good one, its just too bad the writing fell short.If the person reading the book had no knowledge of any of the various tools, aircraft, weapons and such, and also no experience with military training or tactics.....then they may enjoy the book."
2,Ugh,"Is it just me, or does anyone else think that when the Cusslers sit down to write a book they first bring out a huge box of crayola crayons and whenever the part comes to introduce a character they blindly pull out a crayon to describe the color of that chacters eyes.And why does Dirk Jr appear to be the oldest 20 something year old in the world. There is a huge problem when a now 70ish year old Cussler is writing a story whos characters are straight out of college.When the kids showed up in (I think it was Valhalla Rising or Atlantis) it should have ended with Dirk Sr excusing himself as the kids made there way touring his car collection in the hanger, and dirk retreating to his living area upstairs, grabbing a quick shot of scotch and pulling out that huge gun of his and putting it to him temple. Is anyone else disgusted at the domestication of Al and Dirk?Cussler and Dirk Sr. have officially jumped the shark. Oh the irony."
2,not a winner,"Being a long time Clive Cussler/Dirk Pitt fan I must say that this book is not by Clive nor about Dirk(Sr.)The best thing to do at this point is to get rid of all the children involved with the project.This includes Mr. Cussler the younger.If Mr. Cussler the elder is unable to continue writing, without help,then retire Dirk Pitt and crew.I would surley miss them but I missed them in this book also."
1,Cussler inserts himself,"This book SUCKED. I set it down when the author inserted himself -as a wealthy, suave, hero- and wished I had never begun."
1,Black Wind: A Bad Wind,"A book of over 500 pages requires a significant investment of time. Trite and clichéd, ""Black Wind"" provides small return on that investment. The action and realism it contains would fit comfortably in a book half this size with ample space left over to accommodate any worthwhile wit and humor. Easily the least ambitious literary effort I have encountered."
4,Next generation Cussler adventure,"""Black Wind"" is a ground breaking novel in that the main protagonist is not only Dirk Pitt Jr. but Cussler's son Dirk collaborated with him to write the novel.As usual an historical nautical event impacts greatly on the present day plot."
3,Too Many Dirks,"This is a Dirk Pitt adventure, a Dirk Pitt Jr. one. With Clive's son, Dirk, involved in the writing and a cameo role by Dirk Pitt Sr. there are too many Dirks which ring like having too many cooks... A fair read."
2,repetitive,"What happened to Cussler? Some of his old books like ""Raise the Titanic"" and ""Atlantis Found"" were really great! Unfortunately his recent efforts are sounding like the same thing over and over. If you are an old-time Cussler fan, the book might still appeal to you but don't expect anything earth shattering in this one. Borrow the book from your public library rather than spending any money on it. You won't be sorry."
2,Black Wind Review,"I've read many of the Dirk Pitt novels and this is the first that felt flat and contrived....I wonder how much was written by Dirk Cussler? The main characters are Pitts two children not Dirk and Al, who are in the story only marginally. For a first time reader I'd recommend Sahara and to the seasoned Pittophile I'd skip this one entirely, you'll be disappointed."
3,"Fun, but Ultimately Disappointing","I wanted to love this book. I really did. Taken by itself, it's rather fun, although the dialogue is not up to Clive Cussler's usual standards. But Son-of-Dirk isn't working for me. To be fair, Tom Clancy's Son-of-Jack-Ryan isn't doing it for me either. John D. MacDonald did it right with 'The Lonely Silver Rain.' He introduced Travis McGee's daughter, and then lowered the curtain on the great detective's saga, leaving Travis and daughter to discover each other and build a life together. I don't think I would love the series nearly as much if MacDonald had tried to pump new life into it by spinning new adventures with the next generation of McGees. Too bad Clive Cussler and Tom Clancy couldn't follow MacDonald's brilliant lead, and close the book on old heroes."
2,"tepid, technical formula didn't do it for me","I have read every CC book there has been and have always enjoyed them. Black Wind is the exception to the rule. Great concept but way too many tangents on technical details. Given that this is the first joint effort by Clive and his son, I guess it was to be expected but I do hope the next book is truer to Clive's writing style."
2,Nautical experts?,"It was hard to believe that the creators of NUMA would make one of the most elementary errors of all seamanship (""knots per hour"", page 8), this and other typos throughout the text gave me the feeling the book was rushed to print."
3,"Nothing new, but if you enjoy the old...","This Pitt novel is the same as the others. A lot of adventure under the waves and above, some violence, some intricate present day plots tied in with the past somehow and the good guy wins in the end. A good yarn if like this stuff, but as a Dirk Pitt fan, I want an atypical adventure, not the same old stuff with a different cover."
3,cusslers need to work on it,"I have been a fan of Clive Cussler for years. Unfortunately, this book is not up to his usual work. I enjoyed it a bit, but I found myself skimming through pages to get to some action. I have come to expect ""non-stop page turning"" from this author. I did not find it here. Perhaps the melding of Cussler, Sr., and Cussler, Jr. is the reason. It probably needs some work....hope it will happen in the next!Until then....this is not a bad book, just a bit dull in places. I look forward to your next, Mr. and Mr. Cussler."
4,Family Affair,"This is a very enjoyable book from my perspective for a number of reasons. First, the plot is dynamic incorporating possible history into the present, a trademark of Cussler's. This has more than a touch of Korean politics involved. It does make for interesting conjecture. Secondly, the Pitt siblings have the major roles. Dirk and Al still are the eventual superstars.Finally, Clive's son apparently did some of the writing (how much is not specified). The Pitt and Cussler families will survive a long time!"
2,"Time to retire, Clive","I'm a huge fan of Cussler's. I have every Dirk Pitt book. I'm about a quarter of the way through Black Wind, and I can confidently say it's going to be worse than Trojan Odyssey, which is easily his worst book ever. Maybe it's the death of his wife, or maybe it's burnout, but Clive needs to give it a rest. The owrst thing is this pathetic attempt to keep Dirk young by suddenly bringing in a son that's EXACTLY like him in every way. How lazy is that?"
2,Tedious...at best,"I've been a long time fan of Clive Cussler, having been introduced to the Dirk Pitt series about half way through the current list of books. It was a great discovery and I was anxious to go back to the first book and read them all.Each time I've seen a new Cussler book on the stand, I buy it, expecting to be entertained as in the past. This time, however, it's been tedious reading...almost a page at a sitting. I put it down and then pick it up, hoping to get reinvigorated. So far...not so good."
1,Junior can't write,"Well, Cussler Junior shouldn't give up his day job. As if errors and fractured syntax weren't enough, excessive, flowery adjectives are littered through out the text. The mistakes are jarring and it is apparent that little attention was spent in either proof reading the text or in editing. One can only hope the majority of the text was produced by Junior and that the Senior Cussler will step up his faltering efforts. Maybe he doesn't feel he can do it solo anymore and thinks he must rely on Kemprecos or Junior. Junior should don his lifejacket, not ""adorn"" it and abandon ship."
1,It's time for the author to retire,"As often happens with many best selling authors of this genre, Cussler, like Jack Higgins and Robert Parker, has lost his former skills and is now beginning to produce long, uninteresting, and tedious books which his publisher hopes to continue to sell based on the success of his earlier works. If this is the best you can now do, then it is time to give it up Clive."
1,Black Wind,"I just got to know Clive Cussler last year when I accidentally stumble upon one of his books during a sale. After finishing the book within 2 days, I became his devout fan and quickly rushed off to grab a few more books. I just got hold of Black Wind recently, and boy oh boy.. I've never read such a boring book before. It took me more than a month to reach the last page and I did that by flipping through the pages after doing a quick scan of the contents. I was really very disappointed with the book. Cussler Jr murdered his father's fame! Cussler Jr tried to clone an Al junior but failed miserably. I don't find his cracks a bit funny at all. Al Giordino is my kind of superhero with his wisecracking jokes and perfect partner of Pitt Sr.I have read some reviews about the book before but I refuse to believe it and regretted spending my money on the book. Towards the end, I was still trying to convince myself to like the book .. but sorry, Clive, I've tried my best."
4,THE BOOK MATCHED REAL LIFE,"I WAITING FOR THE DIRK BOOK TO COME OUT, IT WAS DONE WELL TO HAVE FATHER AND SON WRITING AND IN THE BOOK TOO. I LIKED THE WAY THEY HAD BOTH INVOLVED IN THE STORY LINE WAS A GOOD TIE-IN. IT LOOKS LIKE THE SON WILL TAKE OVER WRITING AND SLOWLY REPLACE HIS DAD. THE SAME GOES FOR THE NEXT BOOK. MORE DIRK JR AND EVEN LESS DIRK SENIOR. THE TIME HAS COME FOR THE NEXT GENERATION TO TAKE OVER. KEEP WRITING!! NOW BACK TO THE BOOK STORY LINE. I REALLY ENJOYED THE NORTH KOREA TIE IN AND HOW THEY WOULD USE ITEMS LEFT OVER FROM WORLD WAR TWO. THE WMD'S WERE A GOOD ITEM IN THE STORY LINE."
2,What A Disapointment,"I have always eagerly awaited each Clive Cussler novel and this was no exception. The story is classic Clive Cussler and by itself is fascinating, however, the writing is boring. To me, Clive Cussler did not write the book, his son did. The women ""gush"" and the men ""snarl"". It was so predictible! I even knew who the person was who was in the boat before they were even rescued. I suprised myself when right in the middle of the rocket launch, I didn't even care if I finished the book. Here's hoping the writing will improve in the next book."
1,The most poorly written book I have ever read.,"I have read many of Cussler's books and enjoyed most of them. This book stands out as the single most poorly written and edited (if indeed it even WAS edited) book I have ever read. Almost every page has an example of poor sentence structure, improper grammar and awkward or inappropriate imagery. I will never purchase another Cussler book."
2,"Poorly, Poorly Written Effort","I am a fan of Clive Cussler and have been from the start of his career. Yes, I know the plots are boilerplates but that has never mattered to me. Dirk, Sr. and Al were lovable characters whose shenanigans and savoir-faire attitude were entertaining. Dirk, Jr. and Summer are shadows whose characters have not been explored in this book. [The authors' offhand mention of their origin leaves the reader at a loss.]What does matter to me is that this book is very poorly written. The numerous errors in style actually detract from the storyline so much that I raced through the book in an effort to finish it before the assault on my senses became overpowering.I do not know whether to lay this problem at the feet of Dirk Cussler, Clive Cussler or the editor (a new one, perhaps?). What I do know is that I will be very cautious before purchasing another Cussler book."
2,Waste of time,This book was an utter waste of time. Very pooly written for a novel of this genre. The situations and ways out of them not just unlikely but utterly and fantastically impossible. Most novels of this type involve characters getting into and out of improbably situations but you can believe them. Not this novel. Purely beyond belief and even out of the realm of the possible. Look elsewhere for a book to read. I probably won't buy another Cussler book.
2,"Dirk Pitt + story idea == same song, second verse","Typical Dirk Pitt book, follows the formula, provides action and technical commentary. Nothing special within that universe, nothing special outside it. Read it while on a backpacking trip when I ran out of my primary reading material, discarded portions as I went -- don't miss having the copy of the book."
1,NOT his best!,"I have loved many of Cussler's books, Sahara and Inca Gold come to mind, but this was horrible! The writing was stilted, the dialog an absolute nightmare, and the women were pathetic. I am not a flaming feminist, but not one of the female characters had any strength when around men...the message sent was, ""just leave it to the men honey, we'll take care of you."" At times it felt like the book was a poorly done rip off of a conglomeration of James Bond movies. I went back and forth from being bored to laughing out loud at the absurdity being sold to me. If this is what Cussler and son are going to produce I suggest we all save our money. Bring back the old stuff!"
3,The Adventures of Dirk Pitt Jr?,"I have been a Clive Cussler fan for a number of years and enjoy the Dirk Pitt adventures immensely. However I was rather disapointed in Black Wind. While it says it is a Dirk Pitt novel, the genuine article-Dirk Pitt is mostly in the background, as is his partner Al Giordino. Rudy Gunn also pops in just now and then. What we do get is a good but not great Dirk Pitt Jr adventure. Dirk Jr and his sister are the main heros. The plot is standard with a very sinister bad guy and dastardly plot. Dirk Sr does make a big splash at the end, but to a Dirk Pitt fan, it was too little too late. Perhaps Clive Cussler is paving the way for his son, Dirk Cussler, to carry on the franchise with the next generation Pitts. But I don't go for it. Like James Bond, the original Dirk Pitt should be forever young, or at least forever an active middle aged hero."
3,"Not real Pitt, but not real bad.....","I have read all the Pitt books. Some two or three times. But since Shock Wave (1996) their quality has steadily fallen off. Progressively more outlandish story lines and lousy editing with glaring typos and factual errors have been increasingly prominent features.This story is based on at least a somewhat plausible premise, that a stash of WWII biological weapons has been re-discovered. The editing has been tightened up a bit, although they should still to a better job checking facts. And why do the characters have to run into a crusty old fart named Cussler in every book? A page or two was funny once or twice, a entire chapter is excessive. The franchise ship is righted somewhat, however mostly writing out Dirk Pitt Sr. and Al Giordano costs a full star as the brother/sister combo of Dirk Jr. and Summer has none of the chemistry of Dirk Sr. and Al."
2,Lackluster,"Let's get a few things straight. You're not picking up a Clive Cussler novel for deep, thought-provoking substance. You're picking it up for over-the-top adventure.Clive's formulaic storylines are tempered (thankfully) by his co-authors.If you're looking for fast-paced, never-to-be-believed action. This could be a book for you. I finished the book a few weeks ago, and I couldn't begin to tell you anything about it."
3,2 Dirks are better than 1,"This is a typical Dirk Pitt ""save the world"" adventure, complete with fictional history (in this case, a secret Japanese plot during WWII to use bio-weapons) and a particularly evil villain (North Korean this time). Dirk Jr takes on most of the hero role, although Dirk Sr (with buddy Al Giordino) must come to the rescue for the dramatic sea launch finale. Damsels are in distress of course, and Dirk Jr pours on the charm as required. If you have never read a Cussler book, you will probably like this better than the 3-star rating I gave it, but after reading so many, they start to sound the same."
3,NOT THE SAME,not the same with the kids. had a very hard time getting through the book. took me three time longer.
2,What happened to the dialog?,"I love Clive Cussler's books. I have all of the them and read most of the twice. There is a big problem, though, with the future of his books. I do not think Clive is writing at all anymore. His name is on the cover but the co-author is doing all of the writing. The style is very different in all of his books. The only close resemblane may be in the Kurt Austin novels. I miss the dialog most from his books. Are we ever going to get Clive back?"
2,last of my cussler buys,"I've read 4 or 5 Cussler books and this will probably be my last. Once a novelist (note the word, ""novel"") starts inserting himself into the novel (again, read, ""novel"") then I start thinking mega-ego and get distracted.I made it through 3/4 of the book, nearly every page in agony with the insipid, unrealistic dialogue. I wish I had the book in front of me to directly quote the last sentence I read but it sounded like something you'd hear in a really, really, really bad action movie. It doesn't even approach being kitchie, if that was his intent.This is a really, really bad action novel/autobiographical fantasy."
1,Unrealistic responses and poor judgement,"Most of the writing is very much canned with relationships straight out of melodrama; however, this can be excused considering the scope of the novel. What cannot be excused are the unrealistic responses to dangerous situations the characters constantly encounter and yet, are able to escape with little or no consequences. The use of Deus Ex Machina can only be forgiven in extreme cases--this is not one of them.The characters are two dimensional in their perfection as well as their near invulnerability. They have no flaws which is an impossibility. The reaction of the United States government to the situations outlined in the novel are naive at its most basest.To say the least, I am very unhappy with this novel."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzz,I am a huge Pitt fan. I always preorder and wait with anticipation for the new adventure to arrive. I was still anticipating at page 200.Hard to get excited when you keep falling asleep - the book is a bore.This is NOT a Dirk Pitt Novel as indicated on the cover.Its Dirk Jr. and Summer.Interesting characters - but they do not carry a book.
2,Black Wind or No Wind,Clive must have been tired and it was not the can't wait to turn the page he usually gives us. First time I haven't stayed up all night finishing one of Clive's adventures.
1,A total disappointment!,"Black Wind (Dirk Pitt Adventure)Endless mis-spellings, technical inaccuracies and appalling grammar were my first impressions of this book. The plot borders on the ridiculous and is full of enormous holes. The storylines are implausible and the characters pathetic. I've nearly finished it now out of a (misplaced) sense of duty but it is certainly one of the worst books I have ever read. I only give it one star because I can't give it none! Its only virtue is that it's very good to lull you off to sleep when you are reading in bed. Don't waste your money or your time on it!!"
1,Racist rant by pro-Goldwater John Bircher nut,"Although Haley rightfully questions LBJ's background and path to power, his racist opposition to Civil Rights undermines any truth in this book. When he campaigned for political office, he promised to use the Texas Rangers to prevent integration under the US Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Bd. of Education. Every labor leader was a communist to Haley, and all Civil Rights legislation was an unprincipaled assault upon ""the Southern way of life."""
3,Old man Kennedy bought LBJ the VP and the VP killed JFK,"I read the book looking specifically for ties to LBJ and the JFK assassination. It wasn't too long ago I saw Jack Ruby saying that if Stevenson had been selected as VP, the assassination would never have happened.When the reporter asked what that meant, Ruby replied ""It's the man in office now."" Of course that meant Ruby said LBJ was behind the assassination.A couple of YOUTUBE videos will make it all clear.Proof that there was a conspiracy:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBpHSyuueMURuby saying it was LBJ:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-L5xYwb2ls"
4,"A very fine little book written by a fellow Texan, coincidently enough right after JFK was Assassinated (w/ help of Lyndon?)","Private Texas Invetigative Author didgood work here. And, surprisingly thislittle book is still available. Maybeit was circulated more than I thoughtwhen I found it in a used book shop in1997! It'll startle Yellow-dog Demo(n)-cans!"
1,An Illegitimate Study,This book is primarily known as one of the early attack books that have become so common today. The book is held in low regard by historians. Readers interested in Johnson should consider reading Dallek or Caro's work.
5,Great Buy,This sucker gets HOT! It's curls my coarse difficult hair in record time and has so many different settings. I just love it.
1,Disappointment,"So I get the iron, I use it three times and suddenly the fourth time it stops heating. I was really disappointed, I loved the results at first and now I just wasted my money. I cant get it to work again and I took such good care of it I'm sure I didn't do anything with it, it was like a treasure to me! So sad :/ I never trusted Internet shopping now I get the reason!"
3,Emitting Burning Odor,"I love my 1 1/4"" Hot Tools curling iron (purchased from Ulta) and decided to purchase the 1"" from Discount Jungle. I was excited to receive it, but when I plugged my curling iron (for the 1st time) it was emitting a burning odor. I used it maybe 3-4 x hoping it would go away, but it didn't. As stated previously, I currently own a HT curling iron and works well with no problems and shouldn't be giving off this odor. I contacted DJ & they sent a replacement. Sadly, that too was giving off a burning smell. Because I don't want to deal with the hassle of paying for shipping (again) & waiting for it (again), I am going to keep it, even though I am worried about safety. I will just keep my eye on it. Oh, well."
5,Love Hot Tools!!,I own several Hot Tools curling irons and think these are great! They get very hot and curl very well.
2,Hot tools...not the same:(,"I was not satisfied with this curling iron. I have another hot tool curling iron, and it does a better job. With in 3 hours my curls are not there anymore. Don't recommend."
5,Great Curling Iron,"I have owned a 1 1/4 "" Hot Tools Professional Spring Curling Iron for over 20 years. These things are built to last! The quality of this brand of curling iron has not changed and I love my new 1"" curling iron. The 1"" barrel size gives my medium-length hair great curls, and I get compliments on the curls in my hair all of the time. My hair is naturally wavy, and this curling iron creates curls that hold very well and do not fall, not even after several hours. This curling iron heats fast and stay hot. I would highly recommend this purchase."
2,Book Good / Cassette Bad,"It's a good workbook to use after you have studied the basic, intro to Spanish books and tapes. There are some good exercises that build upon basic Spanish. However, I think it benefits to listen to spoken Spanish in any language course, and the major downfall in this one is the English narrator on the tapes. Imagine your most boring, nasal impaired, sleep producing college professor -- that's the guy narrating. There is also an irritating ""ding"" every time a translation occurs. If you are already proficient in Spanish vocabulary & are looking for a general workbook to hone up your skills, buy only the book; you will benefit from it. However, if you need to listen to spoken Spanish (like I do) to build and reinforce your pronunciation skills, skip both."
1,Look elsewhere,"Most books in the Colloquial series are very good indeed, but this one is a sad exception. The main drawback is the fact that it lacks vocabularies after the dialogues(!) - meaning that you have to work it out yourself and you don't really know which words to learn. If you already speak (European) Spanish this book is very helpful as it highlights the differences that exist in Latin America. Unless you already speak Spanish this will be a total waste of your money and I'd recommend some other book."
4,4-Star comedy,"This is an original, delightful comedy that everyone would enjoy.Ellen Barkin at her best."
4,A surprisingly good film,"At first glance, this film appears like many afterlife concept films of its time: flawed man dies, must return to earth to do a good deed, agents in heaven and hell await the outcome. But this movie is surprisingly different, on a number of counts. First, it is less a tale about morality and goodness than it is about gender. And as a comedy about gender, it is both excelent and unique. This is in no small part due to the extremely talented Ellen Barkin, whose skill at physical comedy shines in this role as a man on earth in a woman's body.The film takes quite a few unexpected turns before ending much too neatly, its greatest flaw."
5,Ellen Barkin Shines as Perry King,"This is an improved version of the Debbie Reynolds film, Goodbye Charlie.Steve Brooks (Perry King) is a womanizer who is murdered. But he's given a second chance to prove that he is worthy of going to heaven. That is to find a woman who truly loves him for who he is. But to give it a twist, he is returned to Earth as a gorgeous woman, Amanda (Ellen Barkin). She/He is reluctantly helped by Steve's best friend, the very confused Walter (Jimmy Smits). In the process, Amanda finds out who killed Steve.In Hollywood, men playing women are heralded but women playing men are reviled. Therefore, a woman playing a reincarnated man was jeered. But if you go in with an open mind, you will laugh continuously. Ellen Barkin gives a brilliant performance. You believe from minute one that she is Steve and his adjustment to a woman's body.Director / Writer Blake Edwards proves that he still is a comic genius.DVD EXTRAS: None"
2,Switch dVD,"While pleased that i tracked this movie down, i was quite disappointed in the color quality.the movie looked faded."
5,Switch,Ellen Barkin is outstanding as a woman playing a man playing a woman in this movie. She does it perfectly - never comfortable in her beautiful feminine body. This is quite a funny and entertaining gem of a movie.
3,Switch,A different take on life after deathFunny - Ellen Barkin excells as a guy in a girls bodyJimmy Smits has the sexiest behind I've ever seen !!
3,Switch,"Good gender bending fun. Cast is great. This is a remake of ""Goodby Charlie"" and I think its a better film.the product rived promptly, and in good condition. It was new, in its oroginol case and wrap."
3,Who doesn't need a second chance?,"I saw this movie when it was first released and absolutely loved it. Ellen Barkin does a great job of being a chauvenistic male reincarnated in the body of a gorgeous woman; Jimmy Smit (Walter)does a great job of trying to believe this is his best mate reincarnated but is overtaken by his attraction to the drop-dead gorgeous blonde. Even though this movie is over 20yrs old it was still good fun and my husband and I had several laughs from it. However, 20+ years on, I have more discernment than I had then and the thing I didn't like about this movie was, amongst other things, the amount of swearing...I'd forgotten about that. These days I love being able to watch something without having my head blasted with obscenity, blasphemy and crass inuendo; with the skill that screen writers have, there's just no need for so much of that kind of thing."
1,Save your time and money...,"This looked like a nicely packaged movie that could have been an entertaining action type film. But... a weak plot, along with bad acting, some annoying and at times dizzying and shaky hand-held camera work, and a really disapointing so-called 5.1 surround soundtrack that lacked any punch or special effects at all including some really bad theme music (there was plenty of opportunity to at least enjoy a powerful digital surround sound experience with the aircraft scenes in the movie) make this one a waste of time and money. I suggest ""Broken Arrow"" if you want something along this line but of a much higher caliber in all respects mentioned above."
1,Low-budget action,"I haven't seen many Dolph Lundgren movies, so I hope this one wasn't typical. For a super low-budget movie it probably wasn't bad, and if you go in with low expectations you might enjoy some of the fight scenes. But overall it was awful. The footage of the F117 Stealth Fighter was nice, but you can see that on any military website. Unless you're a fan of the actors, I say don't waste your time on this one."
3,PRETTY NICE,Solid action thriller with swedish action star Dolph Lundgren.There something that would hace wanted more in this one but still worth a look.
4,An entertaining action movie,"This movie has a good plot, fight scenes and decent flying effects. the wife is awful, but you dont see her that much so it isnt so bad. dolph is in his prime-with a good suspenseful soundtrack, this is thaeatrical stuff."
4,The Ultimate Guide Vol 2,This is a must have book for all who are new to Reiki.Im a Reiki master and I use all of Steve Murrays books
5,Steve Murray Does It Again!,I recently received my copy of this book and it is a must have for any Reiki practitioner. The concept of this book is fabulous. I have been a migraine sufferer for many many years and this book arrived about 2 days before my expected monthly migraine. I did the healing attunement per Mr. Murray's instructions and I never did get that migraine!!! I have now begun using the healing attunement on myself for allergy induced asthma and it is working very well for me. The beauty of this book is its simplicity. Any practitioner of any degree can use this attunement and it does work. As a Reiki Master I will be recommending this book to all of my students.My hat is off to Steve Murray! Thank you for making your knowledge public!!! Can't wait until the next book comes out!
2,Steve Murray is a problem for Reiki,"Steve Murray does have knowledge about chakras and although his self help Reiki-books have gained interest from many prospective Reiki students that want to get into Reiki as a healing modality, Murrays happy students of Reiki obviously have no idea how his teachings are only discount versions of real in class Reiki training with a good certified, knowledgeable Reikimaster teacher. The information that Steve provides is insufficient and does not give Reiki real credit. I would never buy his books - as they are cheap, skinny, paperback versions of Reiki that are lowering the Reiki standards further all over."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"I am soooooo disappointed with STEVE MURRAY. I strongly believe that He is PURPOSELY Ripping people off. I cant believe this is what he is doing. Anyways, if you have taken Reiki or plan to take Reiki, then please do so somewhere and dont expect anything helpful from this book. I believe Steve wrote this book, assuming people dont know anything about reiki and they will fall for anything and everything. Just save your money and DONT BUY THIS BOOK.."
2,Disappointing,"The book boils down to a single technique, expounded on over and over. Some may like the repetition and all the filler around it, especially if they haven't done much with or read much about Reiki. I was hoping for more."
5,Reike The Ultimate Guide Vol. 2,"Each one of the books and DVDs by Steve Murray are a must have for all on the healing path. Great for the beginner, explaining not only ""how to do"" but also the ""why"" of Reiki. Each book gives more detail than I received in years of study and practice (a must is the Ultimate Guide 3 for the auras). I go back to them time and time again. The most concise information in one place I have read (and I've read alot).The DVDs are truly profound. They work! The blessings you receive from them will make you want to see them over and over again. (but get the books that go with each one so you understand what you have just been given).Wish I would have known these were available when I was searching for a class on Reiki healing - a beautiful one on one way to learn."
2,Nothing new!,"I read the review of this book, I found Steve Murrays web site and got very interested to read his books and I ordered Volume 2,at the same time my friend sent me the 1 and 2 volumes. I was very surprised that the review by itself has more information than the book itself. If you are healer and experienced person I don't recommand you to buy this book, the only part which can be of help are the pictures. But would you like to buy a book only for the picture?"
5,"Informative, thoughtful, challening, rewarding reading.","An Intellectual Look At American Sign Language encompasses contributions from some of America's top researchers, educators, and commentators on sign language communication, aptly edited into a single volume by Tom Bertling. In addition to American Sign Language, the contributors discuss deaf education, the importance of English reading and writing skills, deaf culture, ethical questions, Cochlear Implants, residential schools for the deaf, and the future of education and life for deaf children. Critically important reading for educators, administrators, parents, and others working with the deaf, An Intellectual Look At American Sign Language is an informative, thoughtful, challenging, and rewarding venture into the essence of deaf language and cultural issues framed with critical thinking and skepticism toward the ASL-based approach to learning for the deaf."
1,"Ignore any high ratings for this bike, it breaks often","I bought this bike around a year ago. I shopped around, found that it was cheapest here. There is a reason it is so cheap, everything breaks. First off, when I assembled out of the box, I noticed the rims and spokes were bent, but I figured I just need a bike to putt around on, not go race with. The first week I had it, the pedal strips and breaks off...there's an extra $40 to fix. A few months later, the handle grips crack and fall apart (I also store my bike indoors, so not caused by weather damage.) The tires never stay inflated...the chain broke after a few months. Overall, this POS from china is a waste of money. Spend the extra $50 and get a reliable bike."
3,Pretty good but...,"the bolts are bad quality. Tried to loosen the bolts to assemble the front fender. One of them was on too tight, so I tried all my wrenches and screwdrivers to no avail and had the help of a mechanic as well. All it did was smooth out the ridges. Such bad quality bolts. I will replace them soon with higher grade ones...such a hassle. Besides that, the bike was easy to assemble (besides the front fender) and rode great. I recommend you look around for higher quality bikes first before settling on this one. But if you want to gamble and hope the bike you get doesn't have a bolt on too tight, then buy this one. The only negatives are cheap bolts and fenders."
4,"Good, but doesn't quite match the popular image","The author observes that these poems are more ""lyrical"" than his later ones. Indeed, the language is more abstract and deals more with things in general and less directly with the East Hollywood life with which Bukowski is so firmly identified. I find the work enjoyable but less so than the later work because it reminds me of other, more academic poets and doesn't reinforce my concept of the author's uniqueness as based on the later work, which I read first. Maybe I shouldn't have read the later stuff first, although had I read the first stuff first, I might not have bothered to read the later stuff. On its own merits, this is a good book, and Bukowski fans need to read it if only to round out their view of its author's development.The book is said to contain poems from 1946 to 1966, yet the end note states that Bukowski started writing poetry at age 35, which would be 1955. Exactly why the time span goes back to 1946 is thus not clear to me."
4,Good Work,"Those who find Bukowski's novels a little thin in substance and diversity may want to turn to these early poems, which are indicative of the late writer's considerable talent. Bukowksi's poetry is base, unadorned, and funny. He identifies strongly with the common man, perhaps more authentically than the beats or other subterranean movements of the same period. This collection is a strong representation of his early skill as a craftsman; his voice his genuinely present throughout. Stand out poem is `Genius of the Crowd.'"
4,Good for fast reference,"Easy to read, fairly inclusive of most topics, and well-balanced not too polemically anti-Augustine as some of Fr John's other works."
5,"Stunning imagery, compelling literary writing. Loved it!","G. Miki Hayden has produced several mystery/crime short stories that I've luckily been able to read. I say luckily, because as often as she is published, for some reason her name doesn't attract the notice it deserves. Her ""Pacific"" title prior to this was first class. This novel, however, should be listed in the mainstream category as it includes everything a reader hopes to find in a great book: multi-layered storytelling, finely developed characters, rich prose.Great story! Don't miss this!"
4,I liked it.,"They're all good. Some better than others, perhaps. This book did the trick for me. I don't really know which is my favorite by H. or which one I'd start someone with. I wasn't really dissappointed with the previous books like some reviewers, but as I read this one, I seem to recall feeling like it was a pleasant surprise. I have some personal experiences that draw me to the land up there. I especially love the descriptions of the land as Bernie gazes out (looking southeast from the Chuskas into what some consider desolation, if I recall correctly). Good stuff."
4,Comfortable,"Tony Hillerman's new mystery, ""The Wailing Wind"" is like an old friend in that its the 15th novel set on the Navajo Reservation and includes Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn. Like all his previous books, I enjoyed reading this one as soon as it was published.However, I felt that the storyline was a bit flat and the main characters seemed one-dimensional in this particular book. The new characters for this story were barely developed. The plot was transparent and didn't have much of a ""mystery""I just felt that something was missing. Kind of like looking at the map of Navajo Land that is printed inside the cover. A careful look reveals that Crownpoint is missing.Was it worth the money? Yes, any Tony Hillerman story is worth both my money and my time but this one is less than average, based on my reading the entire series."
2,One book too many,The depth and texture of previous books is lacking here. Chee and Leaphorn are two-dimensional. None of the emotion and angst readers have come to expect. More insights into tribal life and culture? Sorry. Almost nothing. The greatest failure in the book...telegraphing a key part of the mystery about half way through the book. I thought it was a false lead. Nope. Avid mystery readers want to be challenged as well as entertained. The Wailing Wind does neither.
3,I miss the Navajo-inspired stories,"I'm weighing in against the tide here. I've been a Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee fan since the beginning, but this story left me a little flat.What made me such a Hillerman fan were the rich stories of a culture walking a very precarious tightrope between past and present. This story about a swindle-gone-bad between two white men who happened to be interested in some Indian land didn't have the same feel to it as other Hillerman classics like SACRED CLOWNS or COYOTE WAITS.In the past, Hillerman taught his readers important lessons about Indian culture. This book just rehashes old territory, and it's not even a very good trip.Joe Leaphorn, Jim Chee and Officer Bernadette Manuelito (under utilized until now) deserve better than this."
3,Leaves me a wailing,"I love the Leaphorn / Chee series. I made trip to New Mexico and listened to the audio version as I drove through the Navajo reservation - because I loved them so much. However this one was disappointing. The plot was good, but the story was missing the what makes this series so special - the Navajo connection and the people. I'm not a big fan of Bernie & Chee; I liked both Janet and Mary better and thought those relationships were more interesting."
3,Any Hillerman is better than no Hillerman,"To be very honest, this is not my favorite novel in the series. Hillerman is moving his characters along in the progression of their lives. Of that I have no complaint, it's just that I liked some of the earlier novels a bit more ( Blessing Way, Dark Wind, and even Sacred Clowns come to mind). The underlying plot device is also a bit off-putting. Looking back on it after reading the next book in the series, I can see that the author is working on a transition for both Leaphorn and Chee. Still, I would not start to read this fine author with this book. It does not display the beauty of the land or the culture of his native American characters as stunningly as early works."
4,Hillerman is in the hogan,"A fine evening's read. I left the window open just a little so I could hear the breeze squeeze past the pane and whisper its own small wail. One of the best things about detective fiction is the common problem, and the ongoing characters' reactions to the problem. Having read lots of these stories, it was just great to visit with Jim Chee and Lt. Leaphorn again. The setting is as bewitching and captivating as ever. It left that old ""Hillerman-ian"" glow with me after I put it down.OK...there were a couple of editorial glitches that prompted me to re-read a couple of pages, and I place the blame for that on the editorial process. Somebody didn't proof this very well. But this is a quibble. Its about atmosphere, character, effect. This book has all of that and more."
1,Disappointment,"This book was such a disappointment. It was too short, the plot was incredibly transparent, and the romance was clumsy. And at the end, frankly, I think Tony Hillerman just lost a large portion of his female fans."
3,I fell asleep,"I have always been a huge Hillerman fan. However, I kept falling asleep while trying to read The Wailing Wind. This effort is not up to par."
3,The saga continues,"You'll enjoy this book IF you've read and enjoyed the previous books. This would not be a good book to start your Hillerman reading. The Navajo lore, and sense of being and place, which centers and enriches some of Hillerman's previous books is barely touched on here. I found the plot plausible, but the book is a very quick read compared to other in the series: I'd get this one from the library."
5,HILLERMAN AND THE NTP,"I'm a little late in posting a review, one which with 92 others present, will probably be mostly overlooked. Oh, well, that doesn't undermine the reading enjoyment this late story from Mr. Hillerman offers.Tony Hillerman's story concerns lost mines, placer gold, and the people who kill or commit crimes when involved with them. This one concerns a murder, one the killer has already served time for, but as the plot rolls on we find more have also taken place.Sgt. Jim Chee and retired Lt. Joe Leephorn are exceptional characters with cultural information of both the Navajo and Navajo Tribal Police most interesting. Too bad Tony Hillerman is deceased, yet he has left us real reading gems such as this one. This is one fine book.Semper Fi."
5,My first Tony Hillerman novel,"As a member of [...], I wrote a newsletter about the author Tony Hillerman. I had never read one of his mystery novels, which the research for the newsletter inspired me to do. I am glad that I did. It's been a few years since I read a mystery novel and Tony Hillerman brought me back 'into the hunt' with this novel. I found it was an enjoyable novel with good characters a dandy plot. I wish the ending would have been a little stronger, but I believe that it always my opinion at the end of a good novel. I guess this is one those novels I just wanted to keep going.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves mystery novels or who has a fond appreciation for the Native American cultures."
3,A franchise mystery series that doesn't disappoint,"After some huge disappointments in some of the big-name mystery series' offerings this year I was concerned that Hillerman too would fall into this category. I needn't have worried. The book is a fine example of what we followers have come to expect in this series. The focus has always been more on the characters and the Navaho way than on the plot. It's fun to see Leaphorn dealing with retirement, his ladyfriend and his ever present maps. I only wish there had been more description of the lands and customs of the Navaho as there has been in earlier books."
2,Very disappointing,"I have been a Hillerman fan for years, but this latest effort feels tired. Nothing new in character development and the plot was of little interest.How many books has Jim Chee been thinking about starting something with Office Manuelito? At least 3? Add this one to the list. I would not recommend this book."
5,A Profound Master Work!,"A difficult yet profound Master work, written hundreds of years ahead of its time! It is destined to become the primary textbook for the new world religion and the reappearance of the Ancient Mysteries. But because this is a truly esoteric work it is therefore veiled, hidden, occult. In other words it is written in such a way that the reader is obliged to develop the intuition along the way. In fact reading this book does develop the intuition. The longer you stay with it the greater this inner spiritual perception becomes. On the second reading, therefore, everything miraculously fall into place and great understanding is the result."
2,Nice look - Not-so-nice feel,"I purchased two of these sports bras based on brand, price, and product description. This is a very uncomfortable bra for runners. The seams chafe and it does not ""wick away moisture."" The slow shipping didn't help my opinion either. It is a nice bra for less active endeavors."
3,Great in a finacial pinch but really flimsy,FIRST THING. DON'T USE THE CHEAP TABS TO PUT IT TOGETHER. USE SOME STURDY ZIP TIES. I PUT THIS TOGETHER TO TAKE MY KITTENS TO THE VET AND IT FELL APART AND I LOST MY CATS. Great price but don't use the cheap tabs.
4,standard cat carrier,"Actually I haven't put it together yet, there were no instructions on how to put together, but very little pieces, I am sure there will not be a problem putting it together. LOVE that it is made in the U.S.A."
2,Not happy - Very flimsy,"I bought three of these carriers in a hurry and did not take the time to read other peoples reviews. Boy, what a mistake. I will be returning them. The carriers are very flimsy, the handle, door, and side locks are all on one plastic snap off sheet, the door would NOT hold a cat that did not like being caged for any length of time. I will be purchasing more sturdy carriers for my cats."
4,Nice Froggy,"This was a gift for my 6 year old grandson. It seems sturdy enough for young hands, I think he will enjoy the challenge of putting it together."
5,Playgear visor,"Great protector for the psp. Don't waste your money on the plastic sheets visors, get this one, it is the best"
5,the best screen guard i have used,this is the most easy to use...no hassle of bubbles...or screen guard coming off..also it has space for the UMD to come out.If any dust falls its easy to clean off or even wash in water.i ve used other screen guards but mostly with others i had bubbles or some part torn of. but this doesnt have a problem since its hard plastic.totally satisfied.
3,Not so good,"As I read these reviews I bought this pocket, but now I regret it. Coming out of the packing it got numerous scratches, how useless is that! Now when I look at my screen it looks messed up, and there's no way to fix scratches on it like you can a CD. It's ""polycarbonate"" not glass or anything else useful. I suppose it would work otherwise, but packaging STINKS!"
1,AVOID THIS PRODUCT,"This product will actually magnify damage to your PSP. If ANY little dust or grit gets under the screen protector, and it will since there is a slight amount of play in the protector's fit, it will be held there and be constantly rubbed against the screen. The outside of the protector itself collects scratches like a magnet. But today, after just a couple of months of use, I discovered today that not all the marks were on the outside. The device had help to dig some permanent marks into the PSP screen itself."
4,Not bad at all,"Does a pretty decent job of staying in place and providing a nice cover for the screen without making it cumbersome to use the controls. Not bad at all for a cheaper, easier way to protect only your PSP screen."
4,Excellent protection,"I got this protector to save my PSP's screen (which already has a few scratches on it), and it works perfectly. It covers the entire screen, stays on pretty securely. The one gripe I have it is that dirt and stuff sometimes gets under and between the protector and the PSP. It's easily to clean off, but it's a little bit a nuisance. All in all, I highly recommend this."
3,It's okay,"Doesn't bother in the handling and viewing factor. However, it scratches the screen protector a lot, when you cleaning the screening protector and when you putting the screen protector there is dust between"
4,Funny characters dealing with a serious situation,"Fast-paced and fun, TAKING CARE OF MOSES features an 11-year-old boy who knows the answer to the most burning question in his small town: Who left a little baby on the church steps? Randall is torn between telling the truth, which might cause someone harm, and keeping the secret, which might harm someone else. Woven into this main conflict are hints of other conflicts relating to issues of race, poverty, and growing old alone. These serious topics are significantly lightened by lively, funny dialogue with a strong Southern accent. This is a good read-aloud that will generate many points of discussion."
1,Very poor effort,"Lesbian Vampires fails in every category it possibly could. It's attempts at humor are not at all funny. To call them sophomoric would be an undeserved complement. It is neither sexy nor scary, which is what would be threshold issues for this kind of movie. The actors are unattractive and there is absolutely no dramatic tension. There is also nothing to admire in the technical qualities of the film. Even the most amateurish camera work and production you've ever seen is superior to this very poor effort. LV has nothing to recommend it."
4,Classic 80's Soundtrack,"All I have to say is that it is classic 80's. Personally, I like ""Footloose"", ""Let's Hear It For the Boy"", ""Almost Paradise"", ""Never"", and ""I'm Free"". Most people will enjoy the classic ""Holding Out For a Hero"". As for the other songs, I haven't listened to them much but I think it is definitely worth the buy.Anybody who saw the movie will enjoy hearing many of the same songs played in the movie."
4,The Audio Feels Off,"The Footloose Soundtrack is almost as famous and well known as the movie, and indeed played a key role in the success of the movie. All of your favorites are here ""Footloose"", Let's Hear it For the Boy, Holding Out For a Hero, The Girl Gets Around, and others. It's great to have the songs on this one disk. The reason that this wasn't a five star soundtrack was because the audio sounded a bit off to me like maybe they just took the original recording and transferred it to disk without providing any sweetening. This was a minor deal for me because I love the music so much, my love overcame audio imperfections, but persons sensitive to audio issues may have a problem with this soundtrack."
4,"Eh, It's Okay","If you like listening to songs played in the background of movies, go for this one. I am more of the score type of soundtrack buyer. The CD in a whole was enjoyable for a car ride, but not much more than that. I am still satisfied with my purchase though."
4,I like it,"Loved the movies, love the soundtrack. Good music. I recommend this to anyone who loves this movie. A good buy."
5,Great soundtrack,"Love footloose! Best movie ever and the greatest soundtrack! fast shipping would highly recommend for those whom love the movie, it will have dancing."
5,footloose,good song great album. these songs from the album are great to listen too. a little thumping and then the mellower style. just a good album
2,the burden of older recordings,I was a bit disappointed about this SACD. The sound quality is better then the original one but not that good compared to some other SACD's I own. The best one until now is by far 'Brothers in Arms' by Dire Straits. It is also based on a (20 years) old recording but you really get the feeling sitting next to Knopler when he tickles those strings.
5,wonderfully awesome soundtrack!!!!,This cd is so great! It has so many beautiful songs such as ALMOST PARADISE and also so many upbeat songs that get you pumped up for anything. I just wish it had a karaoke cd because I would buy it in a heartbeat so I could sing to my favorite songs!!!
5,I THINK IT'S GREAT!!!!,This has to be the best CD out there. There are classic oldies on here that will never go out of style. 5 stars to the soundtrack*****!!!
5,"Loved it then, love it now",This album really brings back memories. I enjoyed this album when it was first released and I enjoyed it this time.
3,The Horde is loose.,"While not for everyone, the game has some great humor for those that like to see the humor in everything. Players control a gang of Hooligans as they attempt to become the top Hooligan group in Europe during a soccer season. some funny live action video mixed with some fun yet graphic gameplay makes this a cult classic. True the graphics are dated, the game can be hard to play at times, and the materical controversial, but for the price, you cant lose, I laughed my head off at some of the jokes in the game. For mature players only, but a great time for the price."
5,The Gold Shoe by GLH,My sister loved this book and had read it many years earlier. I couldnt remember this particular book and so I have started reading this one. Received this book in condition as reported in a prompt manner.
3,The Gold Shoe,"Tasha is rescued during a snowstorm by a preacher, who takes her home to his mother. The relationship between these three is lovely and would have made for a nice book. Unfortunately, the author brings an unappealing character into the mix whose presence grates on every page and keeps this from being an enjoyable read. Skip those parts and read the rest of the story, which tracks Tasha's journey to finding God."
4,Building Construction Illistrated,"The Illistrations in this book are great, another fine book from Francis Ching. This book was suggested to me by one of my college teachers. It made visualizing and understanding some construction techniques I was not proficiant with easier to comprehend. I think it is a great book to have on hand weather in the construction field or new to it."
2,Great overview---but in the end covers too much,"I bought this book as a reference guide for home framing, and was disappointed. This book covers ALL aspects of construction, so if that is what you want-BUY IT. However, if all you want is a general understanding of home construction instead of learning how to build an elevator shaft---LOOK ELSEWHERE.Smails"
4,Useful,"I used it throughout Architecture school, its easy to understand and very informative. drawing are nice."
3,Informative but could be more detailed,"The book is informative and well illustrated. It's written for the professional builder. This book provides more detail than some of the other books I've studied on building construction. However, the book could be more specific about recommended methods and provide more detail. For example, the book describes using joist hangers to install floor joists. It should also suggest that if possible, joist hangers be nailed to the RIM board or beam before the RIM board or beam is installed."
4,Just enough to make you dangerous,"As an architect I worked for noted, this book gives you just enough information to make you dangerous. Ching provides a beautifully illustrated guide to basic concepts of building construction. It is a great introductory book filled with much useful information, but one can't necessarily build from this book. I use it mostly to explain construction ideas, especially when it comes to wood-frame buildings, than I do as a set of graphic standards. Ching does offer some specific information, such as thermal resistance of building materials and a general span guide for roof and floor trusses, but much of this information is general and should be verified with more precise data books. However, Ching didn't set out to create another ""Standard Architectural Graphics"" book, but rather an affordable guide to building construction which would provide some useful information to the design student and home builder alike."
4,Building Construction Book,"Smooth transaction and great price. The packaging, however, is a little too much. I am not really sure why a used book was shipped in a big box filled with bits and pieces of styro foams. It's a little messy."
3,Needs improvement,As usual I give him kudos for helping people think visually. However like most of Ching's books they are great drawings that come off as disorganized and the lack of narrative doesn't help.
2,Pretty but Light on Detail,"While I agree with others that this book is comprehensive in scope, and while it is beautifully illustrated, it is lacking in the details. Our Building Construction class used it as a primary text, and nowhere does it tell you basics. For example, the drawings have few if any dimensions, which are pretty critical to one's understanding of basic construction (e.g., studs spaced 16"" on center). Like all of Ching's books, they at first appear chock full of helpful information, but more often than not, I find them beautifully illustrated and light on content."
4,"beautiful drawings, complete information","I bought this book expecting a building manual and got the most amazing drawings on the issue that I have seen. It keeps a very logical order, beginning with the managing of the building site and ending with special construction techniques. The drawings are handmade over CAD drawings and that fact doesn't matter because of its quality.It has at the end the complete CSI masterformat System for specificactions, which scopes the whole field of building and a lot of references to institutions related to each division of the CSI system.It's a very useful book. I't's less complete in information than the Graphics Standards or the Neufert, but it's precious, and I must say that books need to be useful and complete, but they need to be beautiful too.I would recommend this book, because is one of the good purchases I have made."
4,Cha-Ching!,"After years of architecture school and years in practice, Building Construction Illustrated remains for me one of the best resources for construction detailing and general architectural design available. This is the first copy I've purchased since the 1st Edition and although I haven't had time to identify everything that's been updated, this volume is very thorough, simply and clearly noted, and, of course, well drawn. A MUST HAVE in any architect's library at any phase of their career."
4,"Excellent book, but missing a component.","I really enjoy this book; it has a fantastic overview of how buildings are put together from foundation to the roof. It also discusses concerns such as loads, soil types, and a host of other details involved in the construction of buildings. It also has considerations to things I never would have thought of such as path widths for people to walk down in ones or twos. To be perfectly clear, this is not an in-depth book. It covers a lot of material in brief with tons of illustrations. It almost looks like a textbook for a building or architectural trade course (I'm not a student). The reason for only 4 stars: I'd probably have given it another star but for a an exception: The book covers rammed earth and adobe construction (relatively obscure and uncommon to modern construction methods) but fails to cover insulated concrete forms (ICF) or structural insulated panels (SIP). This is an omission that needs to be corercted."
2,Great idea; smaller than expected,"I had high hopes for the Kata H-12 holster case, but it barely held my Canon 5D with a standard lens. The side pockets would not hold my zoom and wide angle lenses. The H-14 may be roomier and work better, but instead I opted for the Lowepro Off Trail belt pack which is more modular and worked well while I covered a concert event."
4,Great for the right camera,"This bag is heavy duty and well constructed. It will really only fit a camera body (my 40D doesnt fit unless I take off the extra battery pack) with one lense attached (not a zoom). Lenses will not fit in the side pockets, but I can keep extra batteries, a filter, and some lense cleaning supplies in the side pockets. I would recommend the product, but only if you want a smaller bag for light trips."
1,User-Photographer,Very bulky and bad design. No SLR camera does fit in it comfortably. Shall not be advertised for SLR cameras. Cheap workmanship. Does not worth the price.
1,Worthless,the first time I used this strap it came off of the guitar. It costs little and is worth less! Purchase instead a set of real locking nuts along with a nice strap.

1,It died on me suddenly,"I bought this unit at Costco, and the third time using it, I was happily steaming away one minute, and then the steam stopped. The water was full. The power light was on...I could even hear the unit gently gurgling, but no more steam came out. I've tried switching power sources, changing out the water, investigating to see if anything is clogging the intake, but I can find nothing, and the unit doesn't even get warm when I plug it in. I'm returning it to Costco next week for a new one...Hopefully this is just a one-off problem, because I really liked it and found it much more convenient and easier than ironing."
1,"leaky canister, intermittent steam","I've asked for this product for my birthday present. I was so hyped up and exited. Even though I got so many steam burns that I started steaming wearing gloves, I was happy. About half a year later things went sour. The steam comes out in short bursts, it took longer and longer between the burts to produce steam and then it started leaking form the canister. Now it takes 30-40 min to steam one pair of dress pants and I have to have it in some sort of a tub because it tends to leak more that it steams. I hate it. I wish I could return it but I had it for 1,5 years. I will be buying a new one but an in built water canister will be mandatory."
2,Don't waste your money,I thought this would be quicker that ironing. It's not. It doesn't get rid of wrinkles as well as I'd hoped. How disappointing!! The name of this item is misleading. I would hardly call it a 'professional fabric steamer'.
4,Worth the $$$,"Overall, this steamer is a great value. You get ease of use, 90 minutes of steam, and very solid performance. If new to steaming, it takes a few times to get the feel of it. So, give it time. After awhile, you'll likely say goodbye to ironing forever. As steaming is so much quicker and easier on clothing, as well as a real cash saver when it comes to maintaining suits and similar items."
3,Don't use as much as I thought I would,It is large and takes too much time to set up and it really doesn't take out the wrinkles as well as a good old fashion iron.
1,steamer stanley would not buy,maybe I was being impatient but this steamer would take 15 minutes or more to do one linen shirt. I sent it back
2,Worked for about 1 year,"We purchased this model after our old Conair died on us after about 5 years. This one seemed pretty good for the first 8-9 months although I agree with others that the included hangar is pretty useless and we always seemed to be hanging up the steam tube backwards for some reason. The last months of it's short life, it began sputtering water out of the steam handle and would only output about 10 seconds of steam at a time with another 10-20 seconds of nothing. The last month or so it began leaking water from underneath the unit. In it's a last day, about a 1/2 gallon water poured out all over our carpeted closet while we were gone. I'm not sure if we had a defective unit with a crack in it somewhere or if anyone else has had this happen, but it looks like we'll be replacing it with a different brand."
1,The Mad Trapper of Rat River,"Well, I learned a valuable lesson and that is not to trust the ""reader's reviews."" The first few chapters of the story were sort of interesting but it went down hill from there. The detective work by the author was repetitive and boring. His story pretty much started no where and ended in about the same place."
2,Not so good,I purchased and read this book based on positive reviews by others. My opinion- the story of the the man hunt was interesting but it was down hill from there. Much of the detective work covered in the book was rather tedious and eventually became uninteresting. I commend the detective work of the author but that doesn't necessarily make it an interesting read.The Mad Trapper of Rat River: A True Story of Canada's Biggest Manhunt
2,"OK, But Incorrect Conclusion","I read this book, the story itself is riveting but the end is detective work that isn't all that exciting. The most dissappointing part of the book is that I later found out that the ""full-proof"" conclusion that was made is incorrect (via DNA testing). Dissappointing."
4,Mariachi Extremo,"The Good Things*Lots of good action scenes.*Very excellent, solid filming style and quality. A vast improvement over its predecessor ""El Mariachi.""*Not a bad story.*It's well written.*Not bad characters. Maybe not as good or memorable as ""El Mariachi,"" but they are fun.*Good music.The Bad Things*Ummm...The Questionable Things*A fair amount of absurdity. Some may like it, others won't.This sequel to is a tremendous improvement over ""El Mariachi"" in terms of style, action, cameramanship, and overall quality. Only the story and characters seem superior in the predecessor, but are still fun in ""Desperado."" Anybody who enjoys action films should enjoy this.The DVD has very good video and sound quality. It is mostly in English; parts in Spanish are subtitled. Includes a few good special features; commentary and making-of footage."
5,Great over the top action,"Banderas has been pretty stale in some roles, but he was pefect in this role. A funky score includes a great opening song sung by Banderas.Some movie snobs don't like this semi-remake version of El Mariachi but the sense of humor carried throughout makes it a great addition to any movie collection.Great extended cameo roles by Cheech Marin and Steve Buscemi"
4,A Shoot 'em up thriller,"This was a great action movie with a lot of bullets flying everywhere and some amazing action scenes paced throughout the film. Antonio Banderas brings back memories of Eastwood's ""Man with No Name"" movies and does a wonderful job in the film. This film would make a fine addition to any action collection."
5,This movie is a classic.,"You'll hear bad things about this movie from film buffs and intellectual types. If you don't know who John Woo is, this may not be your movie. But, despite the perphaps un-fantastic story, this movie is great. It's got everything, action sequences that are amazing, fantastic one liners, a gorgeous girl (Salma Hayek), a cool little cameo by Quentin Tarantino (who is hilarious), and tons of just fantastic characters and scenes. You've got to see the guy with the knives, or Banderas's ""band"" (you'll love them, I promise). I'm not great at raving about movies, so I'll just say that this one is worth owning, no doubt."
4,"You can't call it 'middle of the road', certainly . . .","Leave your brain at the front door and your cynicism in the next county, because 'Desperado' is simply a comic-book action film, little more or less. Style is the order of the day, and Rodriguez provides it in spades, with all his cast backing him up marvellously. The Tarantino factor seems a little misplaced, substituting gore for the normally balletic qualities of the showdowns, but the presence of the actors pulls it off with style.Simply put, this movie is what it is - fantastical action/shoot-out stuff, with hardly a thought spared for realism. And that, in the end, will determine your reaction. But let's face it - it's a great ride.At the end of this review, some mention should be made of Ms. Salma Hayek. Insert your own thoughts here. This reviewer's jaw is still being fork-lifted from the floor."
3,Superbit is a real improvement,"Robert Rodriguez remakes himself after El Mariachi, but in Desperado the spirit of his original work was crushed down by self-indulgence. The first 30 minutes are funny and entertaining, then the rhythm disappears.This DVD edition is superlative. I've never seen - and never heard - anything better. This DVD proves Superbit is a real improvement because the original DVD edition of Desperado was really a good one: the betterment both in audio and video is substantial. I'd like to add a note about the DTS track: well, this movie can be boring, but the audio experience offers listening pleasure and continuous surprise and enjoyment."
5,El Mariach pt 2,"Robert who? Until the release of this title no one knew who Robert Rodriguez was, What few know is that Desperado is actually the second in the El Mariachi Trilogy. It takes place years after the shocking ending of El Mariachi, finding the once budding guitar player, now Antonio Banderas, searching for the man who killed the woman he loved, and killing any and everyone who gets in his way. This is the high octane style thay we have come to associate with Rodriguez's movies. This edition of the movie has the choice of watching it in english or spanish with a multitude of subtitles to choose from. The wide-screen has all the benifits of a full-screen without the scrunched up or elongated faces. A must have for Antonio fans as well as Rodriguez followers."
4,Thumbs Up for Superbit,"I admit I was a bit skeptical about how much improvement I'd see with the Superbit version of ""Desperado,"" especially on a nice but not extraordinary 32"" Sony TV (but very good speakers). Glad to say, though, that I did notice significant improvement, not so much in the clarity of picture as in the truer colors. I also preferred the new DTS soundtrack over the old 5.1; the sound seemed to have better presence. It's a pretty severe features hit, though. My old version of ""Desperado"" is the one with ""El Mariachi"" on the flip side, plus there's a Robert Rodriguez commentary and a couple short featurettes. On the other hand, I haven't really dug into those features very deeply, and that disc is quite a bit more expensive. If the movie is what you want and you have a decent system with good sound, the Superbit is worth going for."
1,I thought this movie bit....,"Terrible acting sums this movie up. Along with completely boring plot. I almost fell asleep. I couldn't stand making it to the end. And when it ended. All I cared about was that it was over, not that the main characters survived."
3,"Blood-spurting, bullet-flying, love-making, entertainment!","This is the most pointless and hilariously loud film that explodes into outrageous violence and profanity when it is at its best. Robert Rodriguez never lets his movies run on logic or good plots, but the characters are always inventive and funny. Now if you're offended by trashy sex and gory violence, then stay away. But if you enjoy this Tarantino-inspired schtick, then this is an action-packed treat (filled with brilliant camera trickery)!"
4,Very nice audio....,"This is a great DVD. The video doesn't look any different to me, and I am viewing on a 60"" LCD projector (sony grand wega). I have a sony surround sound system, and the DTS is just awesome. I give this 4 stars because it is too expensive. I bought mine at best buy for less than half the price. At that price I would easily give it 5 stars. No extra footage or anything, but really, the audio is just the best. I am a big fan of DTS encoding, and was very happy to find this bargain. If you liked this film, you will experience it so much better with the DTS encoding (if you have surround sound). I don't think that simulated surround would sound anywhere near as good. SO, make sure your system can decode DTS. If it can, buy it, and enjoy."
5,Favorite shoot-em-up of all time!,"Though the last third drags quite a bit, what more could want from a movie that mixes John Woo, Pulp Fiction, Cowboy/Western, and just about every cowboy myth in Mexican lore.In fact, having seen the movie many times, the latter is what really sticks out. There are SO MANY wink-wink, tongue-in-cheek references and symbolic images to Mexican folklore -- the guitarplayer with a gun, two brothers one woman, the whole rebel who's still a GOOD CATHOLIC BOY, the beautiful Latina who falls for El Machismo in spite of her good sense -- that it could be The Pulp Fiction of such.Trust me. See it with somebody who understands the folklore, you'll get alot more out of it. Even if you don't, this is a friggin AWESOME movie. Explosions, LOTS of gungplay, erotic, yet tasteful sensuality, crackling music, funny jibe, really -- what more could you want??!!???"
2,A stupid movie of violent excess.,"Who cares what it cost or how few people participated? There's no character development, a bunch of ridiculous stereotypes and the jokes are not that funny."
2,Just say DesparadNO!,"This is one of those movies that made for great trailers in the theaters but fizzles fast when you watch it. There are maybe 3 bits in this movie that work. The best is Quenten Tarrintino's cameo. A lot was made of the violence but it looks mostly like 2nd rate John Woo.The action scenes don't deliver the tenseness necessary to get your heart pumping.This is because they look pretty but have no credibility,they're almost silly. Watch it for Salma Hayek(MMMMMm...Salma) or rent El Mariachi, the original and far superior film"
3,"okay, not great","There are some definite nuggets here, and addiction is a good way to look at workaholism and dysfunctional organizations. This was outweighed, though, by a couple of things.First, the writing is horrible. It reads more like a grad school paper. Clunky, turgid academic prose and organization.Second, it's written very much from an addiction/recovery perspective. If you're familiar and comfortable with all those ideas and terms, fine. If you're not, and are more interested in the simple organizational aspects, you might be a little put off.If that last bit describes you, I would recommend the following books instead:-Corporate Cults: The Insidious Lure of the All-Consuming Organization-Chained to the Desk (Second Edition): A Guidebook for Workaholics, Their Partners and Children, and the Clinicians Who Treat Them"
4,people issues,"I liked this book, I'm almost done with it and have found it an honest description of the issues in many companies. You might find it thought provoking, especially if you take the time to compare the many problems they talk about to some of the things happening in your organization. It may provoke some questions. . .like why is that guy never around, or why do people seem to cover for him.It doesn't cover every strategy that bad managers maybe using to make themselves look good at the expense of the company. One I can think of is the ""make all my employees attack each other, foster complex rumors about each other, all to the focus off my crappy ability to manage people"". The funny thing is there is some effectiveness to that approach, even though unpopular. The problem is I have rarely seen it used effectively because the managers usually just are doing it as a self centered way of managing people."
3,The authors are reaching....,"Oh boy....interesting analogy, but I believe that the cause of the woes of many organizations cannot be attributed to just this cause. For the sakes of an entertaining analogy it may entertain you."
4,Meade DS 2000 Series Telescope AC Adpater,The product works well. I no longer have to use 8 AA batteries to power my DS 2090 Telescope. The only drawback is the lenght of the cord. I wish that it were longer so that I could move further away from my house. Otherwise it works great!
4,good for the price,Heavy enough to last numerous trips. I cut mine in half as my cook pot is a small diameter. This gives me two for the price of one.
4,Excellent teaching tool,"These four posters are very useful in explaining diatonic and chromatic scales, the circle of fifths, and counting. they are well made and colorful, though I wish they were laminated. I have to travel from classes and, unfortunately, have no room of my own. So, the posters get wet and a bit beaten up after a while. Still, these were nice enough for my purpase to cause me to re-order them."
5,Thank You for your BOOK !!!,"Thank you for your book, James! It's invaluble source of information necessary to start. It's like ""The C Programming Language"" by Brian Kernigan, ""The art of computer programming"" by Donald Knuth. Undoubtly this book is monument in the Petri Nets area. Everyone, who wants to work in the asynchronous systems modelling field, MUST READ this book FROM COVER TO COVER."
4,nice product,Although it is very thin but it works. I like the feeling when I grab my racket. Will recommend this product to my friends
1,Piece of poo!,"Its NOT universal, I have an 04 Mazda 3 and it didn't fit... It also uses an adhesive vs. the better clip on kind."
4,Very Good,"This is a very good explanation of the Chenrezig Sadhanaand an excellent supplement to Dilgo Khyentse's""The Heart Treasure of the Enlightened Ones."""
3,An ambitious book,"Presented as an Encyclopedia, this book contains general information and one or several regional dolls from each country. The information is interesting but one would have expected more explanations about the meaning/origin of each dress/doll for the country. Some of the dolls are classified by topic (dancers, religion, brides...) which somewhat meets that expectation. The quality of the dolls is heterogeneous, from the plastic doll for tourists to the wonderfully dressed and hand-crafted ethnic doll. I could find similar dolls to the ones I own, which was really exciting, despite a few typos. In general, this book is quite complete since all kinds of regional dolls and countries are represented. Fewer dolls, with better quality and more analysis, might have been a good choice, like in ""World colors: dress and dolls"" by Susan Hedricks and Vilma Matchette. But it is a completely subjective point of view."
2,Theory,This product goes against all my beliefs. I bought this because a freind of mine was acting odd and I wanted to find out what was wrong.
2,DVD quite scratched but content excellent - a MUST SEE.,"This outstanding and important DVD was a gift and when it arrived here in Cape Town, South Africa, I was quite disappointed. It was quite scratched and stuck on the 58 minutes - 32 minutes of the second hour. I cleaned it but to no avail. When something has travelled such a long way (and yes it was properly wrapped etc), it is very disappointing that it is scratched. I was particularly looking forward to the 'positive' bits where they have some sane suggestions for alternatives. Most documentaries only create awareness of problems. ;-("
1,Propaganda for the Alex Jones Crowd,"The Zietgiest movies are more a cult recruiting tool than anything that ""we as a people must see"" These ""Films"" and I use that term Loosely are full of factual errors anybody with even minimal education can debunk. The Opinions offered give no real insight into society and rely mostly on fear mongering and Conspiracy theory. Anybody with half a brain should steer clear of this trash."
5,Life Changing Documentary!,Highly recommend. This documentary changed the way I look at just about everything in this world and the people in it. Helped me be a better person.
4,Early 1970s Brazilian pop,"""Eduardo Gudin""by Eduardo GudinThe first album by Sao Paulo singer-composer Eduardo Gudin, originally released in 1973 on the EMI-Odeon label. Most of the songs were co-written with Paulo Cesar Pinheiro, who was also Gudin's performance partner through the mid-1970s.Songs include:1. Olha O Que Ela Fez2. A Velhice Da Porta-Bandeira3. E La Se Vao Meus Aneis4. Labirintos5. Sozinho6. Sem Jeito7. Desperdicio8. Dia De Muito E Vespera De Nada9. Nem Reu, Em Juiz10. Chorro Do Amor Vivido11. Deixa Teu Mal"
3,The Original Rocketeer,"Republic loved to have kings in its movies (Roy Rogers, the king of the cowboys) and serials (King of the Texas Rangers, King of the Forest Rangers, King of the Rocket Men), usually because the serial hero has that last name (as with Rocket Men, Jeff King). Maybe it started when the studio did the serial version of ""King of the Royal Mounted."" The studio used the same excellent flying effects by the Lydecker brothers that had been used in its earlier ""Captain Marvel"" serial. Rocket Man's flying suit and jet pack proved such an enduring image that Republic used it again in two unrelated serials (""Radar Men from the Moon"" and ""Flying Disc Man from Mars,"" each featuring a different actor and character, not to mention a short-lived ""Commando Cody"" TV series) -- so much so that the relatively-recent ""Rocketeer"" movie did it for a new generation. But the original is still the most fun."
5,inspiration behind the Rocketeer and a good serial too!,Although this one runs a little too long it still holds up as an entertaining video. If you like the old time movie serials than it's right up there with Captain Marvel in the action department. I really loved this because it shows where creator Dave Stevens got the idea for the Rocketeer. Now why doesn't he burn his backside when he takes off?
4,THIS NEEDS TO BE BOUGHT TO DVD!!!!!!; 4.5 STARS,"THIS CLASSIC 12 CHAPTER SERIAL IS A DEFINITE MASTERPIECE. IN ORDER TO SELL SOME SECRETS TO FOREIGN POWERS, A CROOKED DOCTOR STEALS SECRETS FROM INVENTORS AND HE KILLS THE INVENTORS AND COVERS THEIR DEATHS UP. ANOTHER DOCTOR DONS A ROCKET SUIT AND HE INVESTIGATES THE DEATHS UNDER THE NAME ROCKETMAN. GOOD SERIAL. FULL OF ACTION AND IT'S INTERESTING. SERIAL FANS DEFINITELY WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS ONE! BUT, PLEASE RELEASE THIS ON DVD SOON!!!!!"
3,Another quick romance read,"One of SB's earlier reads. Laura Nolan is having to sell the old homeplace (the only home she has ever known that has been in the family for generations) to pay off her deceased father's bills. She was always known as the ""good, little, rich girl"" growing up-has never married or know passion. James Paden who is a self-made millionaire- returns back to his hometown to show the towns people that he is worth their respect by buying the Nolan homeplace and woooing Laura Nolan into marrying him as a kind of vengence. She will be another one of his trophies. He was the bad kid that stayed in trouble when growing up and whose family was poor and no good. Little does he know that there if fire inside Laura's body ready to break out and capture his heart. Sweet story. A quick read.... not one of SB's better books, there is better to read."
3,Not up to her usual standards,"I've read most of Sandra Brown's works, including most of her earliest works (I think this is one of them, which is why it's being reissued), and this book just didn't do it for me. The house is practically a character (ergo the title is the address), and I just didn't share the human characters' obsession with it. Better Sandra Brown novels exist (the Texas series, for starters)."
3,"It was okay, but there are better Sandra Brown books","Reading the first chapter of 22 INDIGO PLACE makes you have great expectations for the book. But it doesnt live up to any of them. Sandra Brown has written better books (ex: tidings of great joy) The character of James was good main character, but had none of the heartwarming characteristics of Brown's other heroes. The heroine was prejudiced and shallow. Like I said, the first chapter is probably the only one worth reading."
2,Not my cup of tea,"This was an okay romance from Sandra Brown's early years, but it comes from the era of romance novels where it was okay for the man to force himself upon the woman until she submitted, because he knew better than her what she really felt. It's not the violence of rape, but it still doesn't sit well with me and it puts a shadow over the entire story. I'm sure there are better romances out there."
3,Somewhere in the Middle,"I've read many of Sandra Brown's novels and liked them all. I even liked this one, but only half as much as any one of the books in her ""Texas"" series. James was a good character, much like so many of Sandra Brown's male heros. Not great, but not bad either."
1,Discussed,"I ordered 3 books at the time I ordered this one. Each one was from a different book dealer. The other 2 books were here within a week and now this book ""22 Indigo Place"" never arrived. It has been a month now and still no book. I will think twice before using book dealers again but definately will never use this one again."
2,It was OK but 28+ year virgin was a bit much even for a 1986 book !,"I borrowed this book for an over-night business trip, It was a light romance novel about a 'bad-boy' who made it good returns home to seduce the 'rich good girl' who is now has financial problems. I would not spend a lot of money on this book but it passed the time in a pinch."
3,Good but dated material - Uses ZBrush 2.0,"The DVD has allot of information to view. There are points were judicious editing could have helped streamline most lessons. With that said there is little or no glossing over. It's presented in its step by step production with explanations made for what is being done. You'll learn that sometimes getting the right look is not automatic - it can take multiples tries using the various tools in ZBrush. Ultimately you do get to the final build of the creature.When I purchased this DVD it was already dated material. It uses ZBrush 2.0 which introduced the original ZSpheres. As of this month Sept - 2009 ZBrush 3.5 has been released which introduces ZSpheres 2 and ZSketch - both phenomenal tools. If you are an owner of ZBrush 3.5, I would not suggest this DVD but wait for new tutorial DVDs using 3.5 or above."
1,Silbey's writing is rubbish,"I could not agree more with Yanni's feelings on this book. Silbey, a Professor of History at Cornell, would greatly benefit from taking the freshman English courses there. His jilted writing style is nearly unreadable. I enjoy reading about the U.S. Presidents quite a bit and have found some biographies to be masterful works. Silbey's book, while informative, is such a tiring read. I feel like I'm battling just to get through a page. I know that there are not many books written about Van Buren in general, but seriously, do not buy this book. It is rubbish. Sorry sellers - this product is 100% bunk."
3,vegetable juicer,Powerful motor and wide feed tube delivers juice quickly and efficiently.BUT-- Do not put the small parts in the dishwasher because the heat warps the plastic.
3,true to his sources,"I read this book to try to understand the relations between foresters and other arms of government in the British Empire, the history of forestry in the Empire and the dissemination of forestry from India. The book is pretty good on the second count, but not so good on the first. Barton scarcely mentions the relations between forestry and other departments -- the reason for this seems to be that he stays very true to his sources, in a way that verges on uncritical: foresters' analysis e.g. of shifting cultivation are taken as accurate, unproblematically and without attention to either the cultural/political lenses of foresters or the many reevaluations of the ecology of such practices. I'd like more context, and a more critical reading of his (almost exclusively official) sources."
5,Soccerfield Is GREAT,"I was told om Mark's books, and I didn't start with The Soccerfield Is Empty. But when I read it, I enjoyed it thoroughly. Both characters Mark and Taylor are well writen, Mark A Roeder does a excellent job with both characters. I highly recommend his books to straight boys/Men, I am straight and I like his books I read so far. Start with The Soccerfield Is Empty, and read his books in chronological order."
5,WOW! A+ nicely written gay teen love story,"I'm glad I found this author! I got a kindle fire for christmas and this was the first book I bought from Amazon. If your a gay jock you will like this book, whether your 16 or 60. Nice to read about other guys like myself. I really enjoyed the authors style, I lost myself in the book and couldn't stop reading. It's exactly the type of gay novel I like to read. The author made me feel like I was part of the story. VERY highly reccomended. A+++ I'm currently reading another book from this author and love it too!"
4,Romeo and Juliet from a gay prospective,This is a great casual read. Roeder does a very good job of conveying the conflicting feelings that all teens have in their relationships. He also does a great job of building up enough sympathy for the main characters that you definately feel moved at the end of this Romeo and Juliet tribute.I don't mind giving away the end because Roeder's references to Romeo and Juliet begin in the very first sentence.This isn't high literature but it is very effective and you will cry in the end.
5,Perfect for a small car,"I wanted to take my bicycle to Fl. from the midwest. I have a small old Cabrio, and was concerned about the rack holding the bike on my 1,400 mile trip. It was perfect for the long journey. I did check it each time I stopped, and found it very secure. I do wish that the bar holding the rack was included, since I had a female bike and did not realize it needed this attachment to hold the bike in place."
4,great fit,Was skeptical about purchase but after it arrived was very pleased with ease of installing and how the bike is properly secured. This is a very good product. Don't hesitate to buy....
3,Attention Women,"I had no trouble attaching this product to my mini-van. It's cleverly designed for this purpose. Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there. I have a standard ""women's"" bike. That is, the bar slants downward. After much aggravation, I realized there was no way my bike would fit on this rack. Further investigation found there is a bar that can be purchased (another $30) on Amazon, so I will be ordering it. My bike is very common (Trek), as are women's bike. The ad should have indicated this shortcoming."
3,2 Bike Car Rack,"Not sure how to rate the bike rack as it was a gift but I am rating the shipping and the way it was packaged. I received it with a 12"" hole broken in the box and it was not packaged in a outer box so the gift was revealed and sitting on my front porch. I would recommend a different shipping and packaging as this was not satisfactory."
4,"Works great, easy to install, not perfectly straight on our car though","This worked for us, and we're happy. The stabilizer parts were essential. I can't imagine being happy with a rack that didn't have those. Because of the particular height of our Hyundai Elantra trunk, the angle on the rack was somewhat upright. I.e. We couldn't get the bar to be level. But the bikes were then just held at a bit of an angle and it still worked great, though I think it would have been better if it had been flat. The closeness of the bikes required loosening the handle-bars on one in order to turn sideways, because one bike was small enough that it was held higher and got in the way of the other. But it worked. I might have gone with the three-bike option though if I'd known about this, because then we could have just spaced them out more and would have the three-bike option if we ever need it. But we're happy with this."
5,Great bike rack!,"I got this for my daughter to use at college with her ""07 Subaru Forrester which has a hatchback. None of the reviews said that it could be used with this model car but we tried it and it worked great. It is easy for her to adjust using the teeth cogs with fold down flaps for adjusting the angle of the bike rack and fits two bikes very comfortably without scratching the car. It felt secure when we attached her bike and it was lightweight enough and easy to collapse and put in the rear of her car. One of my favorite features was the stabilizer strap in the center of the bike rack. It lets you tie the strap around the bikes in a figure 8 pattern to keep the bikes from flopping while on the road. I would definitely recommend this bike for the stability, funcionality and price."
5,Essential Brazillian,"If you're like me and have only experienced Brazilian music in terms of a handful of composers and a slew of renditions based on a dozen or so tunes, you owe it to yourself to check out Gismonti. And if you've not heard his stuff, what better way than to get the Antologia? At once experimental and still rooted in the rhythms and sounds of Brazil, both CDs are packed with ear-opening compositions played expertly."
5,Timeless wisdom,"This is a true Unity book and is a great reminder of the Unity Principles. Clear and to the point with eternal wisdom and insight. Loved it, and will read it again. I recommend it to anyone who wants to get to the truth underlying the illusions of this world."
5,The coolest block of toons ever,"I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised when I ordered this gem of a dvd. The fact that the dvd contained 3 of the most popular 80s cartoons in one collection, sealed my order. It was complete nostalgia watching Dungeons and Dragons once again. Getting a chance to watch more Jayce & The Wheeled Warriors is always a plus. I picked up the UAV Jayce release earlier. So seeing that this dvd had different Jayce episodes, was another deal sealer. The other part of the dvd is Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs. I didn't really remember this show too well (I think it aired when I was 8 or 9), but after watching it, it turned out to be a cool show too.EPISODES Featured on the disc:Dungeons & Dragons: ""The Night of No Tomorrow"" ""The Eye of the Beholder""Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors: ""The Sleeping Princess"" ""Future of the Future""Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs ""Star Sheriff Round Up"" ""Little Hombre"""
2,Not so great the second time,"The book was received quickly and in ""like new"" shape. This was the second time I did this diet and did not like the results I got. Inlike the first time when I felt cleansed this time I was constipated for about 6 days. I thought I followed all the necessary steps and ate all the recommended food and supplements. I made a daily schedule for breakfast, lunch, and dinner based mainly on the recipe's which were not always easy to prepare. I think cabbage may bind me up."
3,Good book. Misleading title,"Book states one day, but must prepare for 7 days and after care. Interesting. Unsure I will use it."
2,"Not really ""One-day"" as it claims","Having lived in Germany I was already familiar with the idea of quick fasts and fasting groups to cleanse the body and periodically offset weight gain. I haven't tried this one because it seemed pretty complicated and requiring lots of effort, planning and the purchase of special stuff like supplements. I was also pretty put off when I read that there was a highly structured 7-day ""prequel"" to the detox. One-day huh?"
4,great detox diet,"The One day detox diet is a terrific way to flush toxins, lose weight and improve eating habits.A little redundant at times."
5,Fast Track Detox Diet,"This book is easy to read. Although the author is a little conceited at times, I plan to use this book indefinitely."
1,This is NOT a one day diet,"First, be prepared, the author makes a lot of statements for the benefit of her own ego. This was a turn off and detracted from the message. Now about the diet: if you want to get technical, yes the detox takes only one day. The problem is that you have to prepare yourself for the detox over a seven day period by following a very difficult diet. My guess is that if you follow the diet, you will get the results you want, but I gave this one a low rating because of the author's style and the misleading title."
2,not exactly one day...,"This is one of those books that sound too good to be true, and is too good to be true. The cover makes promises the context can't keep. There's a seven day ""prequel"" of very restircted eating, the ""one day detox"" of just juice, and a three day sequel of very restricted eating, all to be followed with serious dietary changes for life. If it was easy for people to eat like this they would already be doing it and they wouldn't need this book. There's a lot of good nutritional information here (although she said vinegar makes you acidic, when, even though it is acidic, it makes you alkaline when metabolized, which is what you want if yu want to be healthy). Bottom line is, if you need to lose 10 lbs quickly, can stick to a tough regimine for 10 days, and don't mind gaining the weight back when you go back to your regular eating habits, this book is for you."
5,This book makes fasting enjoyable!!,"If you've ever fasted before for religious/spiritual reasons or detoxing you know the issues that come along with it. Headaches, lightheadedness, weakness and not to mention those constant hunger pangs. That's what I've gone through on other fasts. Not only did I not experience any of those side effects but I learned so much more about what my body needs. I was so excited to fast using Ann Louise Gittleman's system that the losing weight part was just an added bonus. And lose weight I did. I lost 3 lbs on fast day alone and 8 lbs in total!"
3,A couple of cautions,"First a warning: Don't buy her Whey Protein Powder! I've had many of these mixes, and this one is VILE!I found this to be a pretty good experience. There were a few things in the book that I think will really help me in the future, such as the fact that drinking too much at meals dilutes your stomach acids too much. I was also horrified to read that the epidemic of obesity is partially caused by the fact that we spend our days chomping down the hormones that are given to animals to make them FAT!I followed it through to the end, and though I didn't lose any weight since I'm already a no-sugar, meat and tons of veggies Atkins-eater, I thought it was worth doing. But man, it is EXPENSIVE!"
1,Disappointed,"The book made sense to me, and I was excited to start the detox program. I faithfully followed the diet guidelines for the week leading up to the fast, then followed the fast to the letter. This included adding the fiber to the first and last drink of the day. Results? I lost two pounds by the next morning. Not the 3 to 5 pounds expected. But what disappointed me most was that I do not feel detoxed. I did not have a bowel movement during the 1 day juice fast, or the next day, or the next. I am bound up and in misery. I probably will have gained all the weight back by tomorrow and feel worse than before. I am following the three day sequel guidelines to the fast, but it is not working for me. I think this book is just another gimmick. I wish I never bought the book."
2,8 pounds in just one day?,"Well, I knew it was too good to be true. This diet, in order to work, consists of a 7 day pre-diet that is so low calorie and low carb with so many supplements that it's really the 7 days prior to the fasting day that kicks off the pounds. (Gittleman has quite the supplement list that she sells along with her book.) But like any other ""too good to be true diet"" you have to stick to a very strict post-diet in order to keep the pounds off. Otherwise, you gain more back than you had on in the first place. The one day diet is very simple and I can save you the money you might have spent on the book right now: Start early in the morning and drink one cup of diluted cranberry juice and then the next hour drink one cup of water. Drink one cup of water or diluted cranberry juice every hour, all day long, until you go to bed. Good luck."
3,Prefer the Fat Flush,This one day detox is actually ten days long. I read this after reading the Fat Flush plan to see if the one day detox would fit with my schedule better. I prefer the Fat Flush two week plan to this - the Fat Flush book also does a better job explaining the science behind the plan. I really like this author though and have recommended the Fat Flush to everyone in my life!
2,The Fast Track One-Day Diet,"I felt the title of this book was really deceiving. I want to lose many pounds - 'up to nine' as printed in the book in one day not having to prepare for 'THE DAY' over a whole week. Also, living in New Zealand I could not buy the sugarless cranberry juice anyway so it was a futile purchase.However, I agree with all the other information in the book which is really just common sense.I do hope someone really does come up with a miracle weightloss and NOT just another book written by a naturally slim person who thinks they know all the answers for the bigger people of this world."
2,Hate the lay out,This is simply too boring to actually read!!!! Much less follow a diet plan from it
2,"Lots of fluff, little information","Pretty much lots and lots of ""soapbox"" chat without much actual practical information. Not recommended"
3,Just an okay book,"Read it, was okay, not great, did not help me at all so far. Will try to read it again and see what I can do"
2,Misleading Title,"This is a very misleading title. I've tried fatflush and bought this book also. I like Ann Louise and think her advice is sound but for me very difficult to adhere to, like all diets. In this book yes you are detoxing for one day, but on a strict diet leading up to that day. I was disappointed with this book. Lose 8 pounds in one day and gain it all back the next."
5,Weight Loss and more,"Ann Louise's Fast Track is just that. This eye-opening book helped me to lose the last 5 pounds to my goal weight. You know how difficult weight loss can be when you get down close to your goal. Upon completion of The Fast Track, I felt more energized and clear headed. I definitely will recommend this plan to family and friends and will try again around the holidays."
3,Still on the fence,"I'm on day 3 and I'm determined to stick thru it but here's what I've had to endure; headache for 2 days, nausea the 1st day, hip and legs ache on day 2 (like a flu) and TODAY I got a rash on my arms and legs, which I read on Livestrong.com was very common on a detox diet. Note that I only drank 1 cup of coffee a day and I pretty much follow a vegan diet ( lots of beans, corns, avocad, no dairy and oil free breads). Im pretty surprised with so much negative reactions but perhaps I am more sensitive than others."
3,One day? More like two weeks,"This book does a good job explaining impact of toxins on your metabolism and need for detoxification. I found it useful and credible. But the program is quite demandeing and complex. First you need to plan your foods and and shop for them, then it really takes 11 days and you are warned not to skip a step. I have to admit, I still have to get around to it. The one day in the title is just a gimmic."
1,One day,It is by no means a one day detox program. The title is very misleading and unfair to the unknowing.
2,Fast Track is a couple of days then you do the one day,Fast Track is a couple of days then you do the one day.
4,Best Detox Diet I've found,This book walks you through every step of the process and does an excellent job of explaining why. Highly recommended!
4,Fast Track to information,"I started reading this book with the hope of losing some weight. I got much more than that. The information is presented in a logical and progressive format. The writer prepares the reader for what lies ahead very well. She lays it out so that you do this and then this and then voila' you are past the one day detox and are into the 3 day support phase. I followed the process and really enjoyed it. Plus, I plan to incorporate many of the ideas into my new ""seeking health"" lifestyle."
3,Not quite 8 lbs,"This is a very good book, but could be mis-leading. It is actually a 7 day pre diet (very strict) one day fast and 3 day post diet, so after 11 days I felt 100% better, but I only lost 3 lbs on the one day fast."
5,Good Diet Plan,The Fast Track Detox is a practical and easy-plan to follow. One thing great about all of Louise Gittleman's books is not only does she explain what to do but why you should do it in laymen's terms which makes it much easier to commit a restricted plan. I lost 4.5 lbs while drinking one cup of coffee per day. I'm sure if I gave up the coffee I would have lost even more. The greatest benefit however was the marked increase it energy I now have.
5,Plateau Buster,What a great experience! I lost 4.5 lbs in the prequel and 3 lbs on the fast day for a total of 7.5 lbs in all. The best news is that was last week and the weight is still off. Thanks Ann Louise! This has helped kick start my weight loss again after being on a stubborn plateau. I plan on doing the fast again next month.
2,Good Victoria Pratt effort,"The movie is not horrible, but you should choose almost ANYTHING else to watch if you have 2 hours to kill. Having said that, if you like Victoria Pratt as much as I do, it's worth buying for your Vicky collection. She's in about 7 scenes, always wearing skin-tight, hot outfits, especially the gym scenes. Get the DVD for easier access to her scenes and so that you won't have to watch the movie itself more than once. Her physique is buff, like it was in ""John Woo's Once a Thief."" A little fuller than her lean and cut Sarge character in ""Cleopatra 2525."" Victoria is a very big reason, other than Pam, to say ""thank you, Canada!"""
3,Not bad..,"This is not bad for an indie film. Usually, you have to deal with horrible sound, cheap special effects and lousy acting. The Hammer, Dice and the Dragon make this film enjoyable."
3,Pretty Pictures,"Having purchased several books in the past on various collectibles, I thought this book would be a little more informative. It does have lovely pictures of the patterns, but I would have like to have seen the focus maybe be on some key sterling flatware patterns, giving examples of various pieces that may be available in the pattern and a rough range of what prices would be like. Instead it is set up more to show various patterns by piece, which does focus on some patterns throughout the book, but some very collectible patterns are barely even covered in the book. If you are looking for something to help you learn a pattern and options it may have, I don't think this is the book for you."
3,Only leaks when you overfill,"Lots of reviews saying this Thermos leaks. I found it only leaks when you fill your liquids too high. Too high and the extra liquid leaks past the plug like cap. Only fill it to just below the cap and you should have no issues. As extra insurance, after I put the caps on, I tilt it over the sink to let any excess liquid escape. After that, no more leaks.BTW - this thing on Amazon is almost 40 bucks...go to Walmart and you'll get it for more than half off!"
2,Leaks :(,"This thing leaks like crazy... I wish it had a top handle instead of the side, because when you tip it over, it's just a mess. Sad, because other than the leak factor, the rest of the materials on it are super. Very sturdy and solid. I guess I'm going to use mine as a pitcher now or something. It's still really good keeping things hot, you just can't tip it over without leaking."
1,Not impressed,"After a year of limited use, my Thermos now leaks every time I pour coffee. It has never been in a dishwasher, never been dropped, and not used that much. I expected more."
2,Does not work for long.,"I bought this Thermocafe along with the smaller .5 liter version, and both stopped working in less than 6 months. Apparently the vacuum seals are made made of a cheap grade of plastic, and wear out quickly. Hot drinks are not kept hot, and cold drinks do not not stay cold."
1,Another Leaky Review,The top plastic stopper is two pieces of plastic glued together which is apparently prone to leakage. This thermos leaks like crazy when you try to pour. This began immediately.
2,Keep on shoppin' around,"A few years ago, I decided I wanted a thermos. It was a toss-up between this, and the classic green Stanley one. I chose this one because it has two removable rings at the opening, so you can really clean the inside. The smaller ring is adequate for pouring. Also, I like the collapsible handle.But, it does leak if laid down. I recently noticed the outer/larger ring has a crack, kind of along the threads. I'm not sure how long it's been like that.I don't know how well it holds hot/cold temperatures. I always nuke my coffee/tea.Otherwise, it has lasted a long time, so it's worthy of two stars. Next time, I'll try the Stanley."
3,Words of wisdom from an investment original,"I attended a conference many years ago, early in my career as a financial advisor. One of the speakers was Phillip Carret, founder of Pioneer funds. As a young advisor trainee, I hung on every word spoken by Mr. Carret. I took voluminous notes, afraid that I was going to miss some nugget of wisdom that could make me successful.30 years later, I found this book here on Amazon. I ordered it immediately, not knowing what it contained. What I discovered is a collection of quotes from the many writings from this early giant of the mutual fund industry. Recommended highly for readers interested in reading the classics of investing."
5,Mother in law loved it,My mother in law wore this to Captiva and evweryone wanted to know where she got it because they had been looking for one like it
1,Doesn't fit a Nano,"This seems like a pretty cool gadget, although it doesn't hold an iPod Nano. The description makes it sound like it holds any iPod"
3,ok product,"i was excited to get this product, unfortunatley it does not fit my vents in my car. the clips are too short and it will not stay attached. if your vents are appropriate for this product then i believe it is a good product, if not then it is a waste of money"
5,zero hour,"Towards Zero was a great book. The characters and story seemed realistic. While reading it I just didn't want to put it down. It kept me thiking from the part that Mr. Treves died until the end. I also have read Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None"" which was not as realistic as ""Towards Zero."" But there is something that may make you put down the book, the begining. It was downright boring. The author just keeps on talking about the characters' lives. But towards the middle things started to heat up and it got real interesting."
3,BBC Version confuses a good Christie Novel,"Toward Zero, to me, was a great novel. Read like a comedy of manners with ex-wives and former suitors visiting a seaside home for the weekend abound with murder involved. Everyone has a motive and everyone has an abili of some sort.However as a multi-cast audio production , this piece in mired in over shouted lines spoken in blurred sound bites. After the first 30 minutes, it settles down to a good mystery. You just have to have the patience of a saint to get past the first few rough patches of muck to get to the audio cream.When Philip Fox as Detective Inspector Leach arrives in this audio about 35 minutes in, the Christie text starts to sparkles. Leach is NO Poirot, but he has a head on his shoulders.Can I say it was memorable, my answer would be NO. try to get Murder on the Orient Express(Agatha Christie Audio Boxed Set : The Mystery of the Blue Train/Murder on the Orient Express/Death on the Nile)Bennet PomerantzAUDIOWORLD"
4,Towards Zero review,It was a good read or listen but it was short. I had hope for a longer version. I enjoyed the full cast drama.
2,A disappointing Christie,"I tried my best to get through Toward Zero, but I ended up putting id down and bringing it back to the library. I kept waiting for the action to pick up, and it never happened. A real disappointment for me, because I usually enjoy Christie mysteries.I really just entered this review to comment on a standard Amazon.com review phenomenon - that of any critical review of a work that has fans getting banged with 'This was not helpful' votes. What is it with you people? Are you so childish that you can't resist? The whole point of reader reviews is to give differing opinions. No one is kicking your puppy hear. Agatha Christie made her money, and she certainly isn't being done any harm by getting panned on Amazon. Jeesh, grow up!"
5,I want one!,"I purchased this little castle for my 10 month old for Christmas this year. She absolutely loves it--we have so much fun putting the princess in the castle, and then taking the princess out of the castle, and then putting the...you get the idea.The design is flawless, and the carrying case is perfect for carrying the castle and all three inhabitants. I wish all of my daughters toys were this cute and well made. Even the little dragon makes a rattle-y growl-y noise when you move him!I will most definitely buy toys from this company in the future."
3,Shares the author's insights on various aspects of life.,"This is a collection of eighteen essays, originally published in 1907, in which the author, living what he describes as a simple, gentle, and celibate life as a Fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge, shares what he thinks and feels about life, discussing aging, books, art, education, ambition, spirtiualism, and other topics. These essays are fairly easy to read considering the period in which they were written, and offer interesting insight into a way of life that no longer exists in the modern world from the perspective of a man who describes life as a romance, full of interesting things and people."
4,I liked it alot.,Houdini the goat is escaping from his owner and eating Sam Western's prize plants. I liked the book because it is very funny and interesting.
5,I love this book!,"I think this book is an excellent book for kids of all ages. It teaches you about animals and how to care for them. It also tells you about real life problems. This book is a great book and should be read! Kids can put themselves in Mandy's spot, and love it! I would rate this book five stars. This book is a great read."
3,Beware: Grandma is DEAD!,"I was so thrilled to find this book to add to a book basket I am building for my parents who will become grandparents at Christmas time this year. My dad is interested in Habitat and at 9 months pregnant, online shopping is my best bet so I took a chance on ordering a book I had not read. I was shocked when it arrived to find that the Grandma DIES! This book ended up being totally inappropriate for my very ALIVE parents! It is an excellent story of giving and has relevent social commentary about giving and grieving, beautiful illustrations but do be aware that Grandma is DEAD!"
2,Smells funny...,"The cologne I purchased was at a GREAT price, but when I received it, I notices that it smelled different than it does in retail stores. I thought it was just me, but every time I spray it on, it smells awful..."
2,Not for me,I agree With W. Lee. When you first spray it on it smells great. but afterwards it kind of stinks and does have a funny base smell. I like Crush and love Wave.
2,Doesn't last more than 5 minutes,"I bought this product based on Curve Crush, I used it for about a year and always received compliments on it long after I had put it on. This is NOT the case with Curve Chill. You can put on 15 sprays, and though it smells good (a lot like CK One) it hardly lasts for 5 minutes. I would recommend something else, maybe something that stays on for more than a minute. I can put it on right before I leave and by the time I get outside the scent is gone, no matter how close the other person is. With Curve Crush, 2 or 3 sprays would leave me smelling good throughout the day. Very disappointed. Not recommended."
4,The prdouct was good,"This Product was a gift, and the person that it was given to seem to enjoy the semll. Thank you."
5,I love this product....,"the sent is very light and easy on the senses, and last for hours, I will continue to order this and others...."
3,Cologne,This product work ok but it's kinda weak. I put about 15 sprays on and an hour later I couldn't smell it anymore. Maybe it's the body chemistry.
3,"Smells good, but.......",This has a good fragrance but I am concerned that the scent only last a couple of hour before it disappears. Will not purchase once it is done.
3,Alright kind of sweet,"I just recieved this cologne it was a birthday gift for my husband. I like it because of the price and the 4.6 oz, better than the competitors however my husband says it smells rather feminine. I like smelling it maybe he will like wearing."
2,The Hardy Boys investigate music piracy.,"""Burned"", the sixth volume of the Hardy Boys Undercover Brothers, is a letdown from start to finish.Not only do the Boys have to investigate the somewhat dubious ""crime"" of illegal CD burning and music downloading (haven't these guys ever heard of iPods?) but it finds them almost eagerly finking on their classmates - even their buddy Chet Morton!Of course, this being a Hardy Boys story, there is plenty of action. Unfortunately, there is very little detecting.So far, I've enjoyed the new Undercover Brothers series and I hope this poor story is just a bump in the road and not a harbinger of things to come."
1,Terrible presentation of a time honored story series,"This is a horrible deviation, a mutation, from the orginal excellent Hardy boys stories. A sad comment on the lengths a company will go to try to sell a product without even beginning to attempt to strive for excellence, must less put some interest and appropriate dialogue in the story. Shame on the publishers."
3,debz,"Although this product was recommended by my Dr. for toe nail fungus, it doesn't seem to work, I keep using it religiously, but I don't seem to be getting any results."
3,Warranty - maybe - maybe not - holds up as advertised?,"Wife bought a PROFESSIONAL Caphalon set many years ago (12-15) with a lifetime warranty, we added many pieces including a wok. While we aren't professional chefs we cook most nights, watch the cooking shows and etc. Never put this set from stove to oven. Didn't put them in the dishwasher. Wok by definition is high heat cooking. We believe we used the cookwear a lot but didn't abuse it.So anyway we returned our cookware under warranty and just got it back - warranty claim refused due to use of excessive heat. Sigh.So what to do, write a review is the only recourse - sue for $500? Hey we got good use out of the cookwear but at the time money was really tight and we paid up a little to get the best and the best warranty.So now we need some new cookwear and are wondering should we believe Capahlon's claims again on their relatively new products and how they will do over time, their warranty? Sigh the best we can conclude is maybe, maybe not."
5,In love,"I LOVE this set. This was the first ""real"" cookware I've ever bought. My husband and I did months of research before purchasing this set. We've had it now for about 2 months and I can't express how much we've enjoyed it. I've read several reviews that say food sticks and so on, but I think that perhaps those people think that because it looks similar to non stick, it is. It's not! Think of it like this: It cooks like stainless steel and cleans up like non stick (maybe even better!). We almost went with the All Clad, but we just couldn't get over how uncomfortable the handles were. Since I haven't cooked with All Clad, I can't compare the Calphalon One to it, but I will say they heat evenly and cook evenly. Clean up is SUPER easy! Just this morning I made bacon and french toast. I looked at the pans and thought ""There is no way I'll ever get this clean!"" I poured some Bar Keeper's friend on it and went to work with my Scotch Brite pad and within MINUTES it was spotless! Fantastic!"
1,Stickies pans ever!,"I purchased this set form Bed Bath and Beyond over the summer- six months later I CANNOT cook anything right on them. Even eggs stick, I got all the cleaners they suggested as well as lowered my heat while cooking but nothing works. I've never had to scrub pans so hard after making simple dishes. My kitchen aid pan from walmart cooks better than this 350 dollar set.DO NOT BUY!"
2,Does not hold up.,"I have owned this set for 5 years. It was a wedding present and I must say that it has not held up to the test of time. Almost immediately, the set began to show scratches and signs of stress. I was very disappointed in the quality of this product given the price."
2,Not nonstick,"We had registered for All-Clad pans for our wedding last year, and decided to go with a Calphalon commercial nonstick set instead. The person helping us highly recommended the Calphalon One infused anodized set instead, and said the demonstrations he had seen were fantastic. We bought that set and have had it for nearly a year. We hardly ever use it, however, because things stick so badly, even with oil. While the set looks quite nice and cleans up easily enough with soaking and Bar Keeper's Friend, I'm very disappointed with how it cooks and would love to be able to return it."
2,Disappointed,"We have had our 10 pc. set for 11 days and already two of the fry pans have small nicks in the inside surface. The nicks could not be reproduced once the pans were cold, so I can only guess that the polymer infused surface, once hot, become soft and vulnerable. We followed all instructions on using the pans -low heat, pre-heating, etc. One pan we have used daily to cook eggs. The other we used once. We wanted a set that tolerated metal utensils, so this set was especially appealing. Unfortunately, the nicks indicate that these pans do not hold up to regular use with metal. When we took the pans into the store, they agreed to refund our cost. They also said no one else had brought pans in with the same complaint."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"After careful consideration and after reading these ""5 star"" reviews, which BTW had to have been written by Calphalon employees themselves, because this cookware is terrible! EVERYTHING STICKS! My pots and pans look like they have been used 20 years. I went with this particular item because of the teflon/cancer links, and I wanted to use metal cooking utensils. The material the cookware is made out of is very porous, its very hard to rinse even soap out of, and very soft when heated. It is very easy to nic this metal with little force, and the actual cooking surface makes everything stick. Its hard to scrub clean and has never looked clean since I first used it. I have tried the Bartenders scrub, nothing works. I've done everything the manufaturer recommeded and this cookware set has left me EXTREMELY dissappointed! SPEND YOUR MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE!!! Shame shame Calphalon, your name use to mean something to me!!"
1,Worst set ever,"Like others stated, everything sticks except water (which discolors the pans from the calcium deposits). There is no excuse for making these so difficult to use...preheat, postheat, cool down, let the food rest. Sorry, I just want to make some eggs - not a science experiment. Besides, all the tricks in the world does not keep the food from sticking. The clean up is labor intensive every time you use a pan - soak overnight then the next morning scrub your brains out with bar keeps friend with mediocre results.I'm convinced The Emperor Has No Clothes with this one. I paid double the Amazon price a couple of years ago and I'm taking the loss and moving on. I just got a set of non stick Kitchen Aid pans for 1/4 the cost of the Calphalon One."
1,Doesn't live up to the hype,"I bought the 13"" skillet about 2 and a half months ago and am very disappointed to find that there are nicks and chips in the inside surface of the pan. I never used any metal implements sharper than a table fork and didnt scrape hard with that, mostly only used a plastic spatula on it. Cleaned only with a Scotch-Brite pad as recommended by the manufacturer.Pan still works fine but I have stopped using it because of the damage to the cooking surface since I don't want to eat the advanced polymer. Plan to send it back to Calphalon with a letter of complaint.I thought these pans were my dream come true, a semi-nonstick pan that would stand up to everyday use without damage-- but it's really not much better than a cheap teflon nonstick counterpart. Don't waste your money!"
2,Mixed Review for Calpalon One,"I bought a whole set of caphalon one sort of on an impulse a couple years ago based on what a salesperson at William Sonoma said. I find them very easy to clean following the manufacture's recommended cleaning methods. I don't find the food sticks too much. It is similar in performance to my 20 year old magnalite (out of buisness) or stainless pans I've used. To limit sticking you'll still need good cooking technique. It isn't like a non-stick pan but you'll get better browning than non-stick. I try to treat the pans very well, but even so they are getting small dents in the bottoms of them. I don't even understand where they might be coming from. I don't see any such damage to my regular old stainless pans or any of my other anodized pans, which are much older. They still cook ok, but I'm worried about longevity, and it isn't going to help with food sticking."
1,truly disappointing false advertisement,"Does anyone think this is non stick or is it stainless steel with a color coating? I thought I was making a smart decision but I can not cook anything, stir fry, deep fry without food sticking to the bottom.I would not recommend you waste your money on inferior product. Spend less and get non stick."
2,Chef Review,"I am chef trained at the Culinary Institute of America. When I got married over a year ago I put these pans on my registry excited to finally have a really good set of pans like my parents. I was looking for the perfect pan that combines restaurant quality with home ease. Overall, they have been a big dissapointment. The 12 fry pan lost the flat bottom after it's first use. Food does stick to the bottom of the pans. I have learned if you leave the food, like a piece of chicken, in the pan till it's almost burn point, then, and only then, does it become ""non stick."" I will use these pans for a few years and then trade in to Calphalon under the warranty to something different."
2,"Durable yes, beware of sticking","I am nothing close to a professional cook, but was really taken in by the reviews and descriptions of this new Calaphalon line. So I splurged... While I do love the durability and ability to use metal utensils, I just can't get over how badly things stick - everything from eggs to pancakes to burritos to sauteed spinach. No matter how much butter and oil I use, no matter how I try to follow their instructions of letting the food ""warm"" for 10 minutes outside of the fridge before cooking, etc, I've just never seen such sticking. Maybe you need to be a better cook to appreciate these pans... I just want to be able to cook omelettes. Guess I should have gone with non-stick."
1,Beware of False Advertisement!! STICKS LIKE CRAZY!!!,"The ultra catchy advertisement of this ""revolutionary"" cookware and reading the positive reviews were enough for me to buy the Calphalon 10-piece set. I searched all over to find a vendor that delivers overseas and had the set shipped in. The high price PLUS the high shipping charges (overseas!) and customs didn't matter. I had to have it! After a month of trial, I am DEEPLY disappointed. I CANNOT believe Calphalon advertised them as NON-STICK. Everthing STICKS. It sticks so much, everything from meat to fish disintegrates into burnt glue on the surface. Now I can hardly understand where these people with racing reviews are coming from. What are you people cooking?!?!?"
5,Sturdy and well made for the price,I bought this to use as a display for handmade Christmas ornaments at a local gift shop. It came unassembled in a shallow box that I can use to store it when not being used. That also made it easier to transport. Assembly is easy. It is heavy enough construction to hold heavy ornaments. I put a cloth at the bottom to hide the base and it made a very nice display. I looked at a lot of ornament holders and am happy I chose this one.
3,Nice,"This is perfect for lightweight ornaments. I had a heavy Lenox crystal ornament that caused the tree to lean, but it works great on the others."
5,just what i needed,"I collect the paint ponies and horse of a different color ornaments and needed something to display them on ...this worked well. will be adding so ""welds"" to the arms to hold more..."
2,"Heathens, beware",I think you must have been raised Catholic to appreciate this book. The guilt! The remorse!
5,Look great!,"Bought this for my step-daughter for Christmas and they look great! She hasn't worn them yet, so I'm not sure as to the comfort! They came quickly though!"
1,"Not a good read.,",I have read many books. This is by far one of the worst pieces of literature ever produced. I do not see any redeeming qualities in this book and will not suggest anyone even look at the hideous cover. The author does a terrible job. I am sick by reading this book. So sick I can no longer type.
1,Plagiarized Story,"This book is a plagiarized rewrite of the Jim Kjelgaard classic. It was not authorized by the Kjelgaard estate. The last authorized printing of the Kjelgaard story was the expanded edition ""The Hunter Returns,"" by David Drake and Jim Kjelgaard which, sadly is out of print, as is Kjelgaard's original. But being out of print does not mean the story is up for grabs. The copyright is still held by the estate and Frank X. Harris has no legal right to the characters and situations which he has usurped for his own thematic purposes in this poorly written knock-off. Please purchase the legitmate versions of this story.Fire-HunterHunter Returns"
1,Makes Me Sick to My Stomach!,I can't believe the blatant plagiarizing by this so-called author. Did he think no one would notice or remember the original classic with the same name and characters? How Rude!!!
1,The Worst Kind of Plagiarism!,"It is absolutely unbelievable that someone would stoop so low as to plagiarize the work of a beloved author, Jim Kjelgaard, who died in 1959. Fire Hunter was one of over 40 books that Jim Kjelgaard wrote. Even IUniverse, the vanity publisher who will publish anything that a so called author will send to them, pulled this book off their site due to them finding out it was a plagiarized work. Check out the IUniverse site for yourself to see that they no longer carry any book by Frank X. Harris anymore. Even when you search by the ISBN number, ""his book"" (and I use that term loosely) doesn't come up. Why Amazon is still listing this book is pretty unbelievable. What an incredibly shameful thing to do for both Amazon and the plagiarist."
2,Bad Quality,"The quality of this DVD set is bad. the originals could not have been this bad, I hope. I guess they did their best."
5,Worth a re-read,"This was the collection of stories that helped me find my voice as a writer. While reading Grass Fires, it became clear to me how important it is to tell your story in a patient and relaxed manner. Let the reader quietly observe the story's characters as the events unfold; nothing dramatic or spectacular or shocking needs to occur to hook the reader, so long as your voice is honest and observant. I was amazed, and still am, at Mr. Gerber's ability to tell a simple story that, I know as a writer, is extremely difficult to pull off. These are simple stories about everyday people, going about their everyday lives, while dealing with those little complications that keep us reading."
1,Not so great - unless you want 100 year-old material in a new cover,"The book essentially repeats the theories and provides descriptions of electrical concepts that have been taught the same, old way for years. There's nothing new here, and a great many books from the 1960s offer better discussions and explanations. Save your money."
4,Fuel Injection System,Its good couse the information enough for beginner and intermediate in mechanic world. Thanks
2,This is the Haynes Book,"This is the Haynes book. It gives good, basic info on the 300ZX but nothing on specifics. Compass system is not mentioned, headlamp sensor, lightbulb replacement in the automatic temp control unit ect."
5,a very yummy winter warm-up,"I drink a lot of tea, particularly herbal tea, and I like to have a wide variety or options so I don't get sick of it. Sadly, my grocery store doesn't sell a variety pack so this was perfect! Without a doubt, the Ginger Twist is the best tea in this set but they are all good. I also enjoy the silly little messages they put on each tea bag. For my husband and I, the 6 month subscription of this was perfect as Amazon sends us more just as we run out."
4,great herbal tea selection,"Nice herbal tea selection. No caffeine, thats just what I was looking for. Another great peppermint tea. Chamomile tea is nice too. Again, got way too much lemon tea that just got passed on to friends and my mother."
1,Dear God!,"There is a reason Coleman Barks's free ""renderings"" of Rumi (and of other medieval mystic poets, including Hafiz) sell so well: they're often witty, poetic, even sexy. Whereas there is none of that in THIS collection by Crowe. Instead, you get at least 30 repetitive pieces (I lost count) out of 100 that all begin or contain minimal variations on the line ""Winebringer! Bring me more Wine!"" What this collection is I don't know, but it's neither scholarship nor poetry. ""Poor Hafiz!"" (as the Persian sometimes refers to himself) has taken on a new meaning indeed in the hands of someone like Crowe."
4,Edgren's Italian Dictionary,"This is an adequate dictionary-- lots of words, only short definitions. I need it because I'm reading Dante in Italian, and want the Latin etymologies of his vocabulary."
3,Wodehouse is great; Davidson does well,"This refers to the audio version. The stories are entertaining. Davidson does a good job. He is a versatile reader and always keeps your interest, although I must admit that he is not my favorite Wodehouse storyteller. To each their own - but the very best Wodehouse readers, in my opinion, are Jonathan Cecil and Martin Jarvis."
1,Don't Buy This !,"This awful bootleg has been issued and reissued for over 30 years. I have it on LP. It's an amateur recording made at the September 13, 1969 Toronto Rock 'n' Roll Revival held at the football stadium of the University of Toronto.Why does it sound so bad? For one thing, the concert promoter (Detroit's ""Uncle"" Russ Gibb) was a cheapskate, and provided only the minimum P.A. system, and this did not include stage monitors (which is why you often see photos of singers of that day singing with one finger in an ear so they could hear themselves).My guess is that, ""Ain't That Just Like A Woman?"" and ""Goin' to the River,"" the two songs obviously not sung by Alice Cooper are by '50s rebel Gene Vincent, who the Alice Cooper Band, formerly known as The Spiders, often backed up. He played earlier that day.All this junk does is make money for the bootleggers."
1,Not Appealing at all,"Like the first book ""Undeniable"" this one was written in a very juvenile writing style. I had hoped for some improvement in her second book that is why I gave her another try. The constant repeating of phrases, thoughts and goofy love sequences were just too much. If you must give this a read, purchase the book second hand---better yet borrow it from someone and save your money. I will pass both books on to others and not keep it in my collection. I have take KM off my list of future authors. If there was a zero rating I would have selected that."
1,Disappointed,"Maria Kristina Keir: is my super soprano / mezzo-soprano diva.We bought this album just because she was on the cast.Mind you, her voice is unparalleled...but the album doesn't show it off, and the musical recording on the wholewas a disappointment..at least in comparison to what we have listened from her other albums,TryCaldara - Maddalena ai piedi di Cristo, which is an absolute wonder, totally out of this world...also,Monteverdi: Scherzi MusicaliLamentazioni per la Settimana SantaPer il Santissimo Natalethe price of the album was not proportional to the quality of the work.that is why I am really disappointed."
5,The Charlottesville Book Lady Loves Baffled About Baby,"This is a terrific resource which I highly recommend to new parents and/or baby caregivers. It is extremely user-friendly and is great for anyone (most of us) short on time. I was especially impressed with the detail and quantity of information given, and found the narrator to be both professional and warm. The CD format is a terrific twist on a very functional must-have item for expectant parents, childcare providers, or anyone who loves babies. It has now become my shower gift of choice!"
1,Worst Most Sagging Piece of Junk Ever,"Do you want a net that slowly loses tension as you play? I mean do you want to visibly see the net tensioners sliding their way up the rope as the net sags. Are you sitting at home thinking, man what I really want is a net that's super loose at the bottom so there's no way I could ever play a ball off of it? Well then this is the net for you. You'll love having people over for a game and tightening the net every five seconds. Your friends and family will be amazed at how poor the quality is, and wait till you tell them how much it costs! They'll be even more amazed. This is literally the worst volleyball net I have ever owned, it's going back tomorrow."
2,Instructions stink,The instruction on how to assemble are horrendous. Plan on spending hours trying to figure out what they are talking about !!!
4,Great V-Ball Set!,I purchased the Park & Sun Tournie Flex V-Ball set for a family reuinion. The set was easy to set up and very strong and sturdy. All I had to purchase extra was the ball. We had a great time playing for hours and look forward to many years of fun with the set at other family and friends gatherings. Highly recommended - great quality product. Worth the extra money because the cheaper sets are so flimsy.
4,Good product but shady delivery,"We got the net set in good time, but the box was pretty beat-up. As you might expect, when the box is beat up, there's probably some tiny thing missing. Yup, there's a plate at the bottom of one of the poles that was missing. Not a big enough deal to make a stink about it, but it still stinks to buy something and have a part not be there.All in all, though, the net is fantastic and sturdy. It's easy to set up and take down, and the net itself seems good quality."
5,For the money it can't be beat!!,"I read some other positive reviews and that is why I bought this net. It is really good quality and easy enough to set up and take down. I would suggest getting different tie down stakes although they work, but come out easily if hit. All in all it is a great net."
4,Park & Sun Tournament Flex 1000,"nice heavy duty net & poles and rope.. the only downfall are the stakes used to hold the poles they look like 12"" nails and come right out of the ground, so i went to home depot and bought anchors $40, no problems"
4,Not the best but a good yarn,"In the future scientists discover that the sun will be going Nova soon. A desperate race against time ensues in which we attempt to create vessels for fleeing into space and preserving the race.David Jones, a happy go lucky writer and pimp, has become semi-famous with his novels. And now the world is coming to an end! But all is not lost. A new invention, a transmat booth, enables one to travel at faster than light speed. Calculations are set and a few of these are set off. Of course David gets invited and learns that during the flight - which may last for hundreds or even thousands of years - he will be only swirling atoms without a distinct physical shape. Only when they find a good planet will he materialize. He leaves behind the woman he loves and shoots into space as the Earth melts."
3,Les Paul DVD,Did not meet expectations which is probably my fault...this is more of an instructional DVD not performances
2,"Began life as a very good, enjoyable LP but a remastering mess",I owned this LP of the lovely Dvorak Sextet and the passionate Smetana Piano Trio many years ago and enjoyed it greatly. A very nice performance of some outstanding Czech chamber music. I jumped at the chance to get this CD when I learned it had been reissued and am very disappointed to report that the remastering has ruined the underlying recording. The CD remastering is unfortunately very muddy and the tonal balance of the instruments is distorted. Look elsewhere.
5,awesome as always,Harold Budd cant really put a foot wrong - he is an amazing musician. this is a great selection though nothing really new not available on other cds - but I loved it
5,Great African Thumb Piano Music!,The music you here on this CD is hard to find anywhere else! And the intricate rythms and patterns make it sound ahead of it's time. Hugh Tracey recorded this back when rock and roll was in its infancy and bathrooms and water fountains were still racially segregated!
4,I had a little trouble getting to sleep after reading this!,"The best part of Alvin Schwartz's book was trying to figure out the end of each story before I actually got to the end. Sometimes I got it right and sometimes the story had a twist. The length of the stories are perfect for younger ages of nine or ten but I think older kids would enjoy the book also. The illustrations that go with the stories sometimes made you think a particular story would be scarier than it actually was. Overall I enjoyed the book. It didn't take up a lot of time, I was done with it in one night!"
2,more scary stories to tell in the dark,"I would give the book three stars on the cover, one star on the book, and two stars for the summary in the back of the book. I think the book sounded interesting and looked good, but the stories weren'tscary and interesting. I would have given it five stars if it was scarier and more interesting. I think that ""wonderful sausage"" was the best story out of all the stories. I thought it was the best because it was scary and interesting. It also talked about the guys arm being cut off and eatin like sausage. The auther of the book is Alvin Schwartz."
2,Not scary,"[Written by my daughter] At thirteen and a half years old, I read some of these stories laughing at the end because they were so pathetic. I fail to see the gore in here. There are no descriptions at all, and the plots are uncreative. It's basically the same thing over and over: someone thinks that they won't die but they do. If I were younger perhaps I would enjoy it more. So if you are looking to get this for someone under fourth grade, by all means, they will like it. But for those who prefer real, set up and descriptive horror, get a Steven King book or something. Of course, this is coming from a girl who is read stories about women who kill their husbands with lamb chops and then feed it to the detectives, but, you know, that doesn't make the book any scarier.In summery: It stinks. It's not scary. Don't buy it."
4,Fantastically Frightening Follow-up,"Alvin Schwartz goes back into the rich history of urban legends once again and offers up a wonderful collection of many stories I previously had never heard of before as a child. Artist Gammell again captures the sickening essence of the stories with illustrations both haunting and disturbing... yet always fascinating! Again, ignore the suggested age range, as the stories collected here are sure to give readers of ANY age the willies and the desire to sleep with the lights on..."
1,Shouldn't they be SCARY??,"These stories [stink]. They are all so similar and repetitive, with either no ending or the same ending. Don't buy and scary stories books for the stories, the only thing making this book worth more than a penny is the AMAZING ILLUSTRATIONS!!!. No one older than five would be afraid by these."
1,Worst mistake I ever made...,was buying my daughter this book! It's been at least two weeks... and bedtime is still a nightmare. The minute the lights go out she starts thinking about this book and the tears start! Ugh! We learned the hard way that our daughter wasn't ready for this type of book. If your child is at all sensitive to scarey stories - avoid this book.BUT! If your child loves spooky stories/movies - this is the book for you! It is well written and the illustrations are very scarey (my husband LOVED it!)
1,an easy ZERO... the software forces you to choose 1 star,"I urge adults to really think carefully about what is in this book before they expose the children in their lives to its quite stark cruelty and depravity. There is really very little here that is scary in the sense that youngsters crave - suspense - but rather there resides some genuinely disturbing scenes of merciless, mindless, violence. Serial killings, cowardly murders, extreme cruelty to animals - we'd never let our nieces and nephews, sons and daughters read about the BTK killer in the newspaper, but we blithely hand them this book because it presumes to represent folklore. If they wrote this in school, they'd be sent to the psych for fear of being the next klebold."
1,The Gayest Stories Ever?,"These stories could not raise one goosebump on my entire body. I read this to preschoolers and they didn't think they were scary at all. They laughed at me for reading the stories. They said that they were the gayest stories ever. I have three uses for this book: a coaster, firewood, and toilet paper. This book is NOT worthy of being read. The only reason it got one star is because that's as low as it would go, plus the illistrations made the book 0.95% ""spine-tingling"". I better go out and find something REALLY scary for those preschoolers..."
4,Joe's review,"After reading the book More Scary Stories by Alvin Schwartz I came out laughing, confused, and somewhat grossed out .The kind of book that those kinds of emotions come out of it is a real page turner. Although this book is made up of stories that come from all over the world, it is still a book that I think many people would read.This book has many good qualities to it like how it can make you burst out in laughter or make you lose your lunch. This book has stories about a man who got revenge on his old friend and his dog. Also there was a man who was dead, but didn't know it. Another story is about a perfect girl who got pranked. My favorite story is about a ship and its crew that saw a dead body that comes out of the sky.This is a good book for a moderate reader because it has a lot of dialect in it that can be difficult to read."
