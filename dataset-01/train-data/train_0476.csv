2,Very disappointing,"Repition and the lack of depth to the characters, apart from Dorrie, made this a dull read."
4,Flows like water.....,Extraordinary.... simply Shield at her best! This is the best sory I've ever rad so far! Shield described Larry as a character of typical Canadian that really gives a true impresion on what is really like to be Canadian. The stories flow like a river eventhough the ending of the dinner party doesn't give much excitement as expected! Still.. this is highly-recomended!
3,Maze for the Mind,"What I didn't get immediately, but then dawned on me Eureka-fashion at three o'clock in the morning, was that this book is structured like a maze. Yes, think about it - it keeps looping back and more is revealed about one thread of story each time. If you took the trouble of tracing the paths of the maze diagrams in the book, you would see that.Now why didn't I see that?The writing is very good prose, and the descriptions often very rich and sensual - especially of the Harris tweed jacket (I own one) which I read three times, before reading the rest of the book. However, the tale lacks an emotional centre ... its like a well-written story about ... what? Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of ""about what?""/slice of life stories which sizzle - but this just wasn't one of them. I felt exactly like ... completing a maze and finding an ugly stone fountain at the end. Exactly. Unfortunately."
1,Boring! Boring! Boring!,I didn't care for Larry or the author's writing style. I was suprised at how highly the book came recommended.
2,Larry just stood there and let life happen to him,"John Lennon once wrote ""Life is what happens while you're making other plans."" Lennon never met Larry Weller, a man drifting down the river of life with no rudder and no destination in mind.Larry Weller is a male character dreamed up by a female author, and save for one passage on genital slang, Larry's interior monologues are about as interesting as two-day old Wonder Bread. Good thing men aren't really as dull as Shields makes out; I'd have to give up and move to Mars.Only the final scenes -- Larry's Party -- give a glimmer of the talent this woman holds in reserve.Like so many other people, I was annoyed and frustrated by the gimmicky structure of the book. There was no need to continually reintroduce background material. I wondered if the chapters were not in fact intended to be short stories. Certainly the Larry's Party chapter could stand on its own as a story.A disappointing read."
3,Tedious,"This is a complicated and tedious book. I spent twice as long reading this book as I usually do, and almost put it down once or twice. Ultimately I'm glad I stayed with it. The look inside Larry Weller's mind was unusual and kind of scary. He ended up being a very successful man while being a victim and a doormat along the way.I guess we all do this as we try to make our way through the complicated maze called life. The dialog in the party scene in the last few pages makes this book worth reading. I would say that I predicted the ending, but truthfully it was probably just what I hoped would happen! It makes me wonder how many opportunities I've missed simply because I was not ready to understand them."
1,This book was not helpful at all,"After reviewing all the choices in this category, I purchased this book because the description promised solutions to e-mail overload. As a busy entrepreneur running a 10-person team from a home office, e-mail is a very big part of my workday. I was looking for solid strategies to help me use this tool more efficiently and effectively. Instead, I got an eye-glazing management analysis, pitifully short on solutions. Directed at managers and employees of large corporations, the book is all but useless for anyone else. The so-called solutions were just short of insulting. A few standout examples: ""Don't send unnecessary e-mails""; ""Don't read every e-mail you get""; ""Pick up the phone instead of sending an e-mail."" Ya think? Maybe there really is no solution, but after slogging through 189 b-o-r-i-n-g pages, it would have been nice to come away with ONE solid suggestion that could be implemented. I can't say I got even that."
5,Increased Business Productivity,"I enjoyed this book because it helped me increase my business productivity by redefining my e-mail habits.Christina Cavanagh outlines the dangers of e-mail, including viruses and lawsuits. She also shows the productivity decreases caused by spam, e-mail ping-pong, and inappropriate use of e-mail as a communication medium.More than that, she gives practical suggestions on how to increase your productivity using this essential business tool."
4,"I agree, where's the foremost poets?!","johnny dangerous offers the most brilliant piece of house music i have ever heard with open season...my god what a killer tune. i played this during a dj set i was doing at a party and EVERYONE runs up and goes OH WHO's THIS?! its such a classic tune, no wonder johnny dangerous has been collaborating with everyone from missy Elliot and beyond. the rest of the cd is filled with decent tunes, like dntel's anywhere anyone which i found comes in a close second for best on the cd. most of the other tunes are not bad, but generic german house music. if i were you i would buy the formost poets debut album instead of this. also check out another brilliant piece of work by foremost poets called moonraker..classic house tune"
4,WHERE IS THE FULL FOREMOST POETS CD?!,"This is a great jazz/broken beat/funk/house comp CD, but my burning question is...after sterling singles like MOONRAKER and now OPEN SEASON, where oh where is the full-length debut from FOREMOST POETS aka JOHNNY DANGEROUS? They make intelligent, twisted, spacey tech-house and need to be heard!"
5,Layman's pleasure,"I am not a medical doctor, so Dr. North used just enough medical jargon to make the novel real, but not so much a layman was lost. It was a great, quick and enthralling read. Wonderful first novel, and we all anxiously await what suspense the next will bring. Buy this one, read it, and then put it away, as this author could really take off."
4,Sincere First Effort,"In House Call, Darden North successfully experiments with various literary techniques that ensnare the reader in this realistic Southern environment. North's return to modernism is by far the most appreciable aspect of his novel. The character descriptions are obviously well thought out believable. My main qualm about this book is North's Russian, in general, and Dostoyevskian, in particular, approach to the ending. This concerns me on the basis of innovation, not quality. I expect North's second novel to encapsulate the South as perfectly as House Call did. Perhaps he can shed new light on the plague of Southern reverse discrimination."
3,Not a story worthy of an OVA,"I was hoping the quality of the anime would be a step up from the two previous series and the movie, but alas no. However visuals aside this particular story is action from the word go. There's not a lot of time for funny business (but it's there). Ryo and friends basically stumble into an international incident in Japan, which begs the question of 'how is that sooo convenient?'. Since there is so much action in such a short amount of time, it leaves you feeling somewhat cheated for story, however it probably only feels so, in the way the anime is conducted, but still, it's not a strong story to make a special anime out of."
3,IT' OK,You cannot tell from the picture that this is a one piece unit. No real explanation from the ad on how it is to be installed. I thought this was a frame with a door insert. What I got was a one piece unit with a spring loaded clips. Makes it difficult to install around studs. Nothing for the spring loaded clips to grab onto. I had to buy velcro strips to make it work.
3,review,"there is a ridge in every corner so it did not fit like i thought it would , but i can make it work"
5,Favourite record,"I have the vinyl disc of this bought in 1981 in Paris. It is worn out with playing and is my favourite disc of all time, especially ""Barbara"". Not on iTunes. Almost I am in a dimly lit Parisian nightclub with masters of the genre. Les Feuilles Mortes is the ORIGINAL but original autumn leaves. Nothing is more authentic, or more haunting."
3,A little book,"I just give it 3 stars, but it is what it says. The ""Little""... This book is in a microformat. No photos, just some illustrations, but it give you an idea how you can make vintage bodice."
5,amazing,"its too bad jann has only had one hit... she deserves so much more recognition. this cd is amazing. the perfect cd to smile to while remembering the past, or to cry to while doing the same. jann's lyrics are wonderful. this is my favorite cd in my collection, i never get sick of it. i was dissapointed with living under june, maybe because i got this amazing cd first. i hope she comes out with another this brilliant. this is a must have cd for everyone!!"
4,"Good, yet depressing...","Jann Arden sure must have had a lot of pain inher life. She sure sings with depression. But you can tell she's happy on some songs, ""To Sir with Love"" especially. But on ""Weeds"" she's talking about a dead friend and on ""Shooting Horses"" she talks about hope shining through on a rainy day. She is very talented and I have both her albums. I hope she does another one very soon. But she gets only four stars because if you're happy, these songs can get you down."
1,Wake me up,"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Great voice and songwriter, but come on! Get over the slow, boring songs Jann! Get some happiness into your life!"
4,Buck up little cowboy,"Best Tracks: Wishing That, Saved, Leave Me NowThere are artists that write best when they're (apparently) down. Jann may be one of those people.If you're prone to slip in a CD about love-gone-wrong when you're life is down this CD should be on your shelf.The good news is that even those the messages throughout this CD isn't necessarily one of hope, it's still a great album. And not one to get you down.I really like this album. A solid score on this one."
4,"Penzler Been Very, Very Good To Rico","Written in a straightforward and almost colorless style, this book reads a bit like a docudrama, or even a long film treatment, so it's not surprising to learn that the author went on to a very successful career as a screenwriter. Author Burnett gives us an entertaining peek at a presumably typical rise-and-fall in the Chicago underworld of the early twentieth century, long before this type of material was well-mined by others. As usual, we are indebted to Otto Penzler for a beautiful edition; the jacket art is a deco masterpiece."
3,Little Out of Date,"This was a quick comic book read, told in journalistic face paced sparse style. It's about a Chicago Italian-American gangster who makes it big, takes a fall, and then gets justifiably rubbed out. Not much of a message here, but plenty of hard-nosed action."
1,do not waste your money,"the book contains virtually nothing that is not available free on the internet; and the internet is organized; the book has no significant table of contents and no significant index; the publisher and author should be ashamed of charging 31 dollars for a book that contains virtually nothing but HOWTO'S; other peoples work: HOWTO'S; yes, the same exactly as you can find on virtually any linux site on the internet; the HOWTO's are thrown together in total disarray; they are made useless since there is no organization and no way you can look up anything;"
5,Very complete!,This book is chuck full of learning and reference material. Each chapter is independent. I like that you can select a chapter and understand it without needing to have read any others. This is a good book choice to learn Linux Administration. The subject matter goes deep enough in most topics that it is worthy of reference shelf space.
4,"Another Linux Book, The Complete Reference",At this time I will leave my review open I have not finished bookwill re-evaluate in 2013 Okay Mates
4,Good for flat surface (not carpet),"I've owned this product since 2001 and I've been very pleased with its suction power. The hole is small depend on what you plan to use this for.I was looking for a product to use in my bathroom, on a daily basis, to sweap the floor clean of hair (after blowdrying). It served that purpose really well.It is useless for furniture or carpet but it's great for PERCISION cleaning and getting to tight corners or cracks.Also, as is the case with ANY OTHER cordless product, it's only good for so many charges and eventually has to be replaced. I'm very happy with it's lifetime though (~5 years) of almost daily usage.PROS:- Light weight- Holds its charge better than most other similar products- Cordless- Powerful suction- Washable filter (no need to replace, just wash it in your sink)CONS:- Only useful for ""bare"" areas- Not useful for furnitures or blinds- Charger base is not a perfect fit and once you snap it on, it's hard to remove without extreme force."
2,Died a young death,This worked ok and I even liked the spout for vacuuming up cat litter in tight spaces but alas it died an early death after only two years.
4,Great movie,"A very good movie, wrongly crucisfied by the critics. I was on the edge of my seat watching this film, and you could never tell what was going to happen. Drew Barrymore proved in this film she was going to be the great actress she turned out to be."
4,It was a good movie and keeps you guessing.,"There were a few parts of the movie that could have been better but if you liked the original ""Poison Ivy"" then you will like this movie. Overall it was a good movie."
3,Drew is fantastic in this film.I saw this film.,I saw this film about a year after it was released an I enjoyed it. It's one of those films you don't know who you can beleive or trust. It's a great film and I try to watch it every time it's showing on cable.
1,A single redeeming scene,"This was the worst movie I've ever seen. The only thing worth watching for is a young Drew Barrymore in a bikini. This film had the worst overacting I've ever had the disprivalige of seeing. Who ever wrote this script ought to be embarrased. Oh well, at least I saw it free on cable."
3,I think it is because Drew is in it or else......,"....... I would never have bought it in the first place.This is really a stupid movie. It is all based on sex and getting revenge.This is definitely not my fav movie of Drew.The movie is about this guy who is obsessed with Drew. But he's really dangerous and violentIn a way she likes it at first, but then he almost tries to rape her, and it's not all that fun anymore.The rest I think you should see for yourself, if it only were to be because of Drew.I am giving it only a three because Drew is in it."
2,Very disappointing,I bought this game for my 5 year old son. I ended up playing for him. The movement of the heroes is very sporadic. I even had a hard time getting the men to slow down so I could get to the hotspots to click on them. They were very jumpy and he was getting very upset because he couldn't click on anything. The game itself was ok. It only took us about 2 hours to finish it. I probably won't buy any more Rescue Heroes on CD Rom.
3,Redwood Film Producer Has it Right!,"My sentiments exactly! I was really looking for a video time capsule of the Martin Show in chronological order, as they were originally produced . . . .instead, I get no semblance of thesequence in which I ""remember"" a particular show. We all have selective memories and as a kid growing up in Virginia in the 60's . . .I remember times and places and the reactions of family members to certain episodes that cling like barnacles to my psychic waterline. I did hope to re-kindle a fleeting glimpse of that time by veiwing the Martin Variety Hour. I will be patient andwait for it to be Done Right next time. Great Review!!"
2,cute but sooooo uncomfortable,"They are really cute, but they are so uncomfortable that I never wear them. The arch is so high and curved that it's painful. If you're one of those pain & beauty people then go for it, but the thing is it's really not a high quality shoe so there's no support. I wouldn't recommend."
2,sucks unless you like cheap shoes,"bad quality, not comfortable at all, I returned thess, they are basically a really high heeled cheap shoe. and if i remember correctly were too big"
3,Alex G,was surprised when we received the items that what was sent to us were tester bottles that clearly state not for sale. They do not have a top or a box. On the upside it is the correct fragrance. Wish they would have stated that they were tester bottles
1,Adult Web Page PHOOEY!,"In the first place, this item is NOT a book, it is a very thin sheaf of individual pages stapled together and in NO way does it resemble a book. Secondly, the information contained within this pamphlet has in NO way shown me how to establish the aforementioned Adult Website as advertised. I very eagerly read the pamphlet and found NOTHING to help me in establishing a profitable website."
3,Decent Value,There is some helpful information in this book. It is a little rough to read due to a few typos but overall not bad.
3,"Poorly writen and edited, but modern in outlook","This text provides a modern point of view on quality. It incorporates the quality philosophy of Taguchi and the most basic of Taguchi methods. Accordingly it has a great deal to contribute to design and operations professionals.Unfortunately a boring writing style and editing errors seriously detract from the value of the text. I may be charitable in calling some of the errors editing errors because they really are beyond what a proof-reader could be expected to catch: they are in the conceptual realm. I have not given the entire text a careful read, in part because the errors I discovered at the beginning of the text undermined my confidence in the text's presentation of subjects I knew less about."
2,twist and not,"The bowls are nice for storage which I felt was a bit pricey. As far as chopping goes, unless you're chopping loads of bulbs, get out your knife and chopping board."
3,Is this really pat?,"I'm a long-time Pat fan but am not impressed by this CD. There are a couple of good songs, but the majority are soulless. It sounds like Pat spent too much time with a vocal coach which has him singing in a generic voice. My wife thought it was someone in Pat's family singing but not him. There are a few songs where Pat sounds ""right"" but not in most of them. Not worth the money."
2,Hoped for better,"I agree with many on this, Pat, please take a long hard look at what got you here...your fans. You had a good sound and good lyrics. I'm not expecting songs about drinking beer on every CD but the sound needs to stay the same...ish (no I do not mean exactly the same, just more like Three Days or Lucky Ones). Like others said, take your lessons from Jimmy Buffet - he sells out large stadiums and has very loyal fans without giving into the ""contrived"" or ""over-produced"" sounds. I don't mean to be too critical here, many artists fall into this path. Just, please, your long time fans (young and young at heart) want the ""old"" Pat back! I don't feel as connected to the music on this CD as I do to Three Days, Lucky Ones, etc."
2,long wait...broken case.,"i oredred three CDs from different places on April 14th.the first two arrrived within a week,long before the delivery window expired. This CD took the full three weeks,plus two days to arrive.Now ,I know it is a long way from New York to Texas,but....really? Then,when I opened the envelope,the jewel case was broken..Front cracked,and hinge broken off.I know it was only a 4 dollar CD,but I wont be ordering from this seller again."
2,Pat green seems to have gone mainstream.,"I have boycotted nashville country music now for the past 10 years. Probably around the time mark chestnut and sammy kershaw started to fade away. I don't know what happened to country music, but it seems that Pat, who I thought was going to bring country music back, has really started to go all rascal flatts on us. If you think this album is good, try his older stuff back before nashville could get theyre badonk adonk, toby keith lovin money snatchin pop genre lotion soaked hands on it. I only hope cory morrow doesn't fall into this landfill. Check these real texas singers out like randy rogers, steve earl, robert earl keen, kevin fowler, roger crager, towns van zandt, stevie ray vaughn,jack ingram, jerry jeff walker, gary p. nunn,rodney crowell, chris knight, derryl dodd, charlie robison, to name a few. I guarantee you'll like any these bands"
5,Sounds Just Like It Should!!,"This is a great CD! People who say Pat Green ""sold-out"" are the same people that would complain if he churned out CD's that all sounded the same. When you're on top, people want to see you fall and some people are bothered by him earning a wider range of success. The music is great, it's just not like his early stuff. He writes songs about where he is in his life and he's grown up just like you'd expect. But the new songs are still the great sing-along in your car at the top of your lungs quality we love Pat Green for."
2,Are you sure this is Pat?,"I am very disappointed in this CD. Not because the music isn't good, because it is. But because it is just not the Pat Green that used to play in Stillwater. The passionate, soulful Pat Green. Back then he sang about things that he believed in and loved. Now he is singing what Nashville tells him to. And this coming from the guy who sang ""Nashville Sucks"" with Cory Morrow. There are a ton of country singers out there that could have released this CD and it would have sounded exactly the same. But songs like ""Southbound 35"" and ""Three Day"" can only be sang by Pat Green. He needs to revisit his roots and come back to the red dirt country music that he was born to play. Will the real Pat Green please stand up?"
5,"A timeless, beautifully illustrated classic for young children","This Caldecott Medal-winning book has been a classic ever since its original publication in 1941. Rachel Field originally wrote this simple, endearing prayer for her own little girl, but countless young children and their families have been blessed by it over the years. The prayer itself has wide appeal, as it basically just asks God to protect the important things in any child's life - family, friends, toys, and all the other children in the world. The really exquisite, life-imbued pictures of Elizabeth Orton Hand illustrate every part of the prayer, allowing young children who have not yet learned to read to follow along with the prayer as it is read by a loved one. I've no doubt that the reading of this little book could easily become a nightly ritual in many a household. Kids will love the wonderful, colorful artwork, while Christian parents will value the message being communicated to their little one."
5,Great,This is such a sweet book to end the evening with your children. My children loved it and I am now sharing it with grandchildren
4,nice metal whistle,"i purchased this as a precaution device. maybe i may get lost in the woods and it may make the difference. one can not whistle sometimes naturally by mouth nor yell, so here is my back up. it will be on me when wondering the woods."
5,Best Whistle I've Used,"I've been officiating swim meets since the late 90s. I recently had my bag containing my officiating stuff stolen, so I had to buy replacements in a hurry. I put a regular whistle in my shopping cart, and decided to buy a backup whistle, and a link to this whistle appeared on the page. I had heard about the brand, so even though it was more than double the price, I ordered one. I used it a few days ago, and it was great. It is solidly built, and the sound is strong and clear. I would not hesitate to buy another one should I lose it, and since (sadly) I lose a whistle a year, it won't be long."
4,nice piece,nicely made and very loud. This isn't the one I ordered but its just like it. Mine was gold brass. But the gold quickly tarnished.
5,Good customer service,"Initially I had an issue with my order. The vendor was attentive, understanding and professional. The issue was resolved and I am very satisfied."
3,ok,it works very well but the battery life in the sensor dosen't last to long maybe a couple of days before you have to replace it with a new one.
4,"Wow, Cheap but good!","It is cheaper, but compared to the other headphones that are out on the market that cost more these really hold their ground. They stay in your ears while moving and about the sound is better than I though it would be, I would say if you don't have a lot of money to spend, but still want something that isn't cheap-o, you might want to check this out."
5,Fiesta Small serving bowls,I purchased 4 of these bowls to go with my everyday dishes. I was interested in an attractive way to present single servings and these do the trick. I can put small amounts of food in these delightful little dishes and control my consumption while enjoying the attractive bowls. They arrived safely individually packaged in a timely manner. Thank You Amazon!
2,Very poor glazing,The glazing was defective on both bowls. This is the only Fiesta item I have ever had a problem with!
4,Good product but...,"Kitchens Etc put price stickers on the outsides of each bowl. These are not coming off easily at all. Each one of them has a sticky, white adhesive mess on the side. The bowls themselves are cute."
5,great for wood floors.,The Persil sofix Parquet floor cleaner is the only floor cleaner I use on my wood floors. It is a breeze to use and your floors come clean and look great with very little effort.
1,Not really needed.,Buy an audio CD of Kitaro. That's enough. Nothing special with DVD. Kitaro's music is good but in this DVD you only see the face of Kitaro and instruments. My idea is; its better to buy Kitaro' s Audio CD. In fact I am using this DVD as an audio CD. I close the monitor and listen to music only.
3,Un CD en un DVD,"Como siempre la música de Kitaro siempre increíble, pero este DVD desperdicia la capacidad de imagen completamente para convertirse desgraciadamente en un buen CD de música."
2,Poorly packaged for shipping,Arrived in bubble envelope and I was forced to return it because it was crushed and the foil was as bad as one I needed replaced. Refund was quick but my face paid the price in nics and scratches because I had to use a damaged shaver for another week.
1,Broke after a few shaves,"First off, the foil came quickly and at a good price - but the moment I started shaving with it, I noticed that it hurt a bit...the foil itself seemed thiner. Then after a few shaves, the part started to fall apart. I can't use it now."
4,Thule 669TT Rooftop Cargo Box,Excellent value. Large and holds lots of gear. Attaches very simply to the roof top crossbars on our Honda Odyssey. Can put it on or take it off in 10 minutes once I got the cross bars lined up and the cargo box assembled the first time!
3,Looking to Buy a Used/Broken JVC GR-SXM740U any condition,"Hi,We dropped ours and would like to purchase a broken one so hopefully we can repair ours. If you have a JVC GR-SXM740U Super VHS-C Camcorder with 3.5 LCD by JVC that you would like to sell cheap please contact me. Thanks,cricketbags@hotmail.com"
4,if only I got 2 of these.,"The color is lovely, but I actually need 2 for the length of my window, and now it is out-of-stock."
3,Video Vault,"There are plenty of software out there that can do a similar job of organizing your psp movies once converted. This does not remove the copyright protection btw, but makes an interesting tool should you need GUI goodness to organize movies.-Sgt of Marines"
2,Yuck,"So I pretty much like all foods, but have four picky eaters, even I don't like these...we love multiple other brands of organic fruit strips/ ropes but no one likes these. I do love that there is an organic apple in each one, but since no one will eat them, it's pointless. I think it's the texture. It's thicker and not sticky? The taste is ok...I guess it's just too different than what we are used to."
3,May suit your needs,"I bought this just to get caller is at a location where I had no phone jack. When I tried the transmitter and receiver in different rooms, it worked intermittently. When, however, both units are bin the same room, it works well. That suits my needs, YMMV."
2,Solo play underdeveloped,"I just switched over to a Mac from PC and was looking for a game program that included backgammon. The reviews all seemed very positive. The graphics are nice enough, but the solo play feature for backgammon is a very bad joke. The game repeatedly makesreally stupid moves. The implementation of the doubling cube also problematic. Since the game does not stop between rolls, one can only implement a double after your roll. Not very satisfying."
3,Fun but could be better,This game is fun for a short time but gets boring really quick. The computer player comments get old really fast.
5,Must have book in a childs collection,We actually bought this book from Harrod's in London when my first child was young and it was a favorite. Now with my other two children it is in their top 10. We love the story and the illustrations. Brilliant book.
5,A Great Set,"If you or a friend has never seen an episode of Monty Pythons Flying Circus, this is a great starter kit for you. I mean, theese are classics, ""Lumberjack"" ""Vocational Guidance Counsellour"" ""Sir Edward Ross"" ""People Falling from buildings"" ""A bit of fun"" ""Science Fiction Sketch(Full half hour) And ofcourse ""Dead Parrot"" and although you can find most of theese skecthes in the film ""And Now For Something comptley Differnt"" This is still a good buy."
5,Simply Lovely,"This audiobook is just lovely. I bought this for my 8 year old son for Kwanzaa, and we are both captivated. It's usually our ""traveling music."" The soundtrack is brilliant, and the stories are just the right length for a listener of any age. My son and I are both very visual people, and we are both practicing more attentive and active listening. We don't get ""lost"" in these fables. The variety of narrators also keeps it hopping. It's fun to see if you recognize the voices as there are quite a few Hollywood A-listers narrating. My only recommendation is that you purchase the book as well as the CDs. The book would be a great supplement to those trying to improve reading skills."
5,super,This is one of my 4 and 6 year old daughter's favorites. The readers are all a-list actors. The stories are beautiful. So much better than the average kids storybook.These stories are probably ones you have never heard before. A couple are a little scary for my girls but they are sensitive. All you do is fast forward.
2,Childrens Book,Got the book and even though it was in good condition it had library stamps on several pages. I was hopping for an unmarked book so not too happy with purchase.
5,What a Surprise!,"I became aware of this book/cd listening to a radio promotion for it. My sister lives and works in South Africa within the AIDS support community, I thought she might enjoy the acknowledgement of her efforts. I bought two copies one for me, one for her. Turns out it is not yet available in ZA - so my sister will be able to use the US discs I sent to entertain and educate her HIV kids. What more can you ask for. Excellent narrative performances by Artists who truly care."
3,There's Better,"Yes - the cause is 5 stars; the stories, less than 5. I've heard 6 so far and I thought only one was good (the very first one). Several are relativly long but do not use the duration to tell anything deep, particlarly interesting, of value... they are just stories. I don't find these anywhere near as good asTell Me A Story: Timeless Folktales from Around the World, which I believe include some great African tales."
4,"Wonderful, but should have been twice the length","Why not five stars? I'm knocking off a star only because of the record label's stinginess.This is a wonderful CD. It's an entirely enjoyable extension of the 1960s Warwick-Bacharach sound. If you're a fan of either Warwick or Bacharach (as I am), it's a must buy.But why oh why did Spy Records not release this as part of a two-album-in-one CD? That's certainly the standard nowadays for recordings of this vintage. It would have been easy to do. The same label has just released three other 1970s Warwick albums on CD.At the very least, bonus tracks should have been added. The CD booklet mentions three other Warwick-Bacharach songs from 1974, but says the trio ""remains in the Warner vaults, hopefully for a future release."" Why weren't they added to this one, which is barely 37 minutes long?I suspect, after Spy has squeezed every dollar from the single CDs, it will combine them in the future. The question is: Are you willing to wait?"
3,The main event makes the night,"Forrest Griffin and Quinton Jackson are coming off their stint on coaching The Ultimate Fighter Season 7. Jackson previously said he would bet his purse that their fight would not go to a decision, while Forrest's new style after being KO'd from Jardine is a stick and move style where he tends to outpoint people. Whose style is successful? Purchase to find out.Ultimately many of the fights on this card were a tad disappointing, but still entertaining if you are an MMA fan. Definitely a more technical event than electrifying action. Depending on what type of fan you are and what fighters you like is what you should take in mind in considering this purchase."
2,This thing is awful,"The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is that it does, in fact charge the phone. As long as it stays plugged in. Which is not very often. Of course I think it was on sale for one cent so you get what you pay for."
5,The best camera ever,I bought this camera about a month ago and it is still working. It is really durable and can handle a little roughness. It tends to eat batteries so keep some handy when you know you're going to be taking a lot of pictures. You'll need a memory card because it can't hold many pictures. I have nothing to complain about. The camera is easy to use. The software is easy to use as well. Two thumbs up.
3,"good book, but beware","I loved Girl with a Pearl Earring and was thrilled when I found this book! I would certainly recommend it for Tracy Chevalier fans, history buffs, or lovers of french language and culture. But my recommendation comes with a warning: This was not, in any way, a happy book. It is actually very morbid.Very little indication of this is given by the summary or reviews, I was caught off-guard. So be aware. You should definitely read this book, but I would personally suggest checking for it at your library as opposed to buying it because you may not want to read it over and over again."
3,Blue used to be my favorite color!,"Must admit that the book is a fast read and there are parts that are very beautifully written, but it took me awhile to figure out the relationship between La Rousse and the modern heroine's hair turning color,why she suddenly seemed to find her husband so unappealing when he didn't seem to be very well defined and had none of the characteristics of her forebear's overbearing and boorish husband. I think had Ms Chevalier stayed in the present and focused on the modern woman's isolation and loneliness in a foreign country without the outlet of her own profession the book would have appealed to me more; on the other hand the story of the medieval woman who allows herself to become involved with the more highly placed neighbor's boy may have been worth exploring more deeply. The combination of the two left me perplexed and I still haven't figured out the ending. Am going to try Fallen Angels though, because I loved Girl with a Pearl Earring."
4,This book was just alright for me.....,"The book is about a young Catholic girl growing up in France when it was mostly Protestant, and the trials and tribulations of this.The books also tells the tale of a girl who moves to France and searches for her family and how they intertwine.Not my favorite from this author but not the worst I ever read either."
3,Not a Pearl,"It's obvious that this is the author's first book. However, that said, it is enjoyable and a joy to see how far she has come... especially when beginning on a fairly high note!"
4,A good first novel,"You can see that Tracy Chevalier has talent in her first novel. This novel is about 2 women (one from the 16th century and one from the present day). Ella Turner does research on her family history in Europe and discovers that she has some common ground with her ancesters. The author has a gift of describing things that really put you where there characters are. I can't give this recording 5 stars because of the foul language that is used (both curse words and taking God's name in vain). I won't spoil the ending, but it is a good mystery right until the end. This review is for the audio cd."
2,"Okay for a debut, but not spectacular","At first I was intrigued by the stories of both Ella and Isabelle, but as I got further in the book, I found myself skipping chapters to read the story with Isabelle, who is a much more interesting character than Ella. Ella just seems to be angry at everyone, and deceiving. And I can put myself in Ella's place since I lived in Naples, Italy for almost 4 years with little knowledge of Italian. So all in all, it's all right, but I much prefer 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' over this."
4,A Mini-Vacation,"I look for books that will provide me with ""an outer body"" sort of experience where I become so absorbed in the storyline that I feel like I'm hovering over the characters in the book. This novel, with its dream-like quality, pulled me right in. Chevalier's novel takes place in the Toulouse region, which I visited last summer, but the focus was more on the characters and the Calvinistic conflicts than the regional charms. She pretty much nails the French intolerance of nonFrench-speaking visitors who are ignorant of their customs, but also shows how they can warm up when the conditions are right. The Isabelle story was detailed, rich and emotional, while the Ella story tended to be a bit shallow and at times tedious. The tie-in, however, between the two characters and of the past and present, motivated interest and kept the pages turning to discover how it all played out. When I finished the last page, I felt like I had been away for awhile and had returned from a rewarding journey."
2,too ambitious,The plot involving past intruding upon present is not unique. Character development was thin as was motivation for action. Writing style was however good and redeemed an otherwise disappointing story.
4,New type of novel for me,"I guess this could be considered a Romance Novel, but I have not read any (other) Romance Novels. But the romance part is only a sideline to this tale. It was an enjoyable read and for me sparked an interest in history. The historical parts are what really captured my interest. I like novels that move around in time and space in a fluid way and this feat was accomplished well in this story."
1,not great at all,"This book wasn't as I expected it. It was morally wrong, and put the worst kinds of thoughts into my head. i detested it. besides...through reading the story(other readers may disagree) i thought that the characters had no depth. ella bugged me because she was always running around with someone, and she never really said that she loved them. isabel bugged me for just about the same reason. i wish the book would've lasted as well as it began"
3,Good Qualities but needs more revision,"I had read Pearl Earring and Lady and the Unicorn and really enjoyed both. This book, however, lacks the sophistication and is really not pulled together very well. I had a hard time following the charcters and often had to look back to see who she is talking about. It was very disjointed and it seemed with some revisions she could pull it together and make it a much better story. Her underlying ideas are wonderful--the rich history and the way of life contrasted across hundreds of years. Thankfully, she has become a better writer after this first novel."
3,Entertaining; Simplistic,"Although I did find this book to be a page turner, it didn't make much of an impression on me. Some novels remain in your mind long after you've read them, you feel you know the characters and you're sad to see them go as you finish reading...Virgin Blue was a disappointment in this sense. I was left unconvinced, of both the characters' solidity and of the events that took place.Also, I was a little disturbed by the way the author described the main character's having an affair, as if it was totally fine because she was just sick of her husband--an example of the author's over-simplification of a rather complicated issue.An easy read, but nothing to write home about."
2,Depressing!,"I really enjoyed ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"", so I was very much looking forward to this earlier novel. Whereas ""Girl"" seems to focus around a young woman who is a strong, moral person caught in difficult and oppressive circumstances, ""Virgin Blue"" features less admirable, unlikable characters who make poor choices all around. So we have adultery, abortion, child sacrifice, and wife-beating, not to mention a historical backdrop of religious persecution and bloody repression. Add to this some miscarriages, rabies, deaths in childbirth, accusations of sorcery and witchcraft, men who are insensitive clods, loneliness and isolation, etc. I know people make bad choices in life, and that life in 16th Century France had hardships I couldn't begin to imagine. But what a depressing book to read!"
2,"Not terrible, but not as good as her other work.","I do not like to start a book and not finish it, but I thought seriously about doing that with this one, as well as ""Burning Bright"". I thought the present day character was whiney and flakey and was terribly depressed with the ""historical"" part of the novel. It's been a while since I read this but I remember thinking ""what the heck this all that have to do with this?"". And then wished I read something else. I was moderately entertained but it was utterly forgettable. Nothing gained. But still, better than ""Burning Bright"". If you've read any of my other reviews, you know how much I am working to keep others from reading that horrid ""novel"". This was better than that one, but still don't highly recommend it. There's lots of better stuff to read."
2,"Girl with a pearl earring is masterpiece, this is failure","This was disastrous. At first it was okay. Two women, same family, different centuries... but after awhile I was totally confused. What in the world was going on? There were too many issues being adressed, and the end is disgusting... it was pointless starting this book, and I regret ever having purchased it."
1,Extremely displeased!,"I ordered 2 different books from 2 different sellers. I received one within 3 days of the order, the other (Virgin Blue) came in 3 weeks later. A week after I received it I sat down to begin reading it only to find that the first 54 (yes fifty four!) pages are missing. If there were negative star ratings, I would go with -5!"
2,Nice idea! Too bad about the execution...,"Tracy Chevalier had a terrific idea when she thought of the plot of this book. The concept of a modern woman who investigates an ancestress, and has her life forever changed by the mysterious story of that long-dead woman, is truly a brilliant and compelling one -- a plot that makes for an amazing, hauntingly well-written book which everyone should read. Unfortunately for Chevalier, that book is A.S. Byatt's _Possession_. Comparisons may be odious, but _The Virgin Blue_ tries to do something so similar to Possession, that its failures are painfully glaring next to Byatt's success.Nice story concept, not bad writing, creative twists - but the characters (particularly in the modern time) are ill-drawn, their motivations (particularly the narrator's) are murky, and the end leaves you with a stale taste in your mouth. Try Possession instead; you won't be disappointed."
1,Tepid Reviews Well Deserved,"I agree wholeheartedly with the Publishers Weekly review cited on this page. The PW reviewer found the main character unsympathetic, due to her baffling dissatisfaction with her almost perfect husband, and her preference for a local Frenchman with about as much continental appeal as a manilla envelope. Chevalier used him as a writer's tool for helping unveil the ""big mystery"", but I don't think anyone could really call it a ""mystery"" because it was obvious from the earliest chapters of the book. For about a hundred pages I asked myself, ""When are these dopes going to figure it out?"" It was tedious slushing through the development of the romance, which took us even farther away from getting to the point. This book was my summer reading, and when I finished it,The Virgin Blue: A NovelI felt I had wasted my time. I don't know if I would have even bothered if I'd known it was a first novel."
2,Not up to Chevalier's usual Brilliance,"I enjoy novels that inspire me to be more than I am right now. Barring that, I enjoy novels that are vivid enough to let me live in another time and place for a while. But not all books are that noble, nor do they all need to be that noble. I also enjoy a good read, a book that holds my interest, that's funny or otherwise engaging. Unfortunately, The Virgin Blue was none of these for me. I disliked the historical character almost immediately. It took me about half the book to dislike the modern character. They have no emotional skills, no center, but are just buffeted about by the events in their lives. I got about three-quarters of the way through the book and realized I just didn't want to live with these two any more.Susan Lynn Petersonauthor of Clare, a novel of Irish immigration"
4,entertaining,"The Virgin Blue, being Tracy Chevalier's first novel, isn't as compelling as The Girl with the Pearl Earring, still it was interesting and a good read. I liked her descriptions and the mood of the book, although the characters could have been better developed. Still, it's worth checking out."
2,A Downer,"I ususally love historical fiction. This could have been a great book,it had interesting thematic elements & plot but in it there was unecessary sexual violence and many things are never resolved in the story. It leaves the reader hanging. I read it in two days because I was really interested in the plot. The story kindof got out of control and then it abruptly ends. It left me a bit depressed. I don't think I will read any more of this author's books, if they are all like this, which is a shame because the plots seem like they would be very interesting. I guess I just don't like this author's style."
5,A Beauty,The best novel I've read by Chevalier. I was awake until the wee hours of the morning to read the last section of the book and ended up missing work. The language is exquisite. I'm jealous of those of you folks that still have the opportunity to read it for the very first time around.
1,I give up!,I can't seem to finish this book. I love the story of Isabelle but Ella's story makes this book intolerable. I'm on page 170ish and just read that Ella is a midwife. I realize now that it was mentioned earlier in the book but I forgot. It's just not believable. Ella's character lacks self-esteem to the point of it being annoying!
3,Lacking Strength,"This is my least favorite of Chevalier's novels. I found this story depressing, at times confusing, and with characters I could not relate to. For instance, why did Ella lose feelings for her husband? He certainly wasn't cruel like Etienne.The reincarnation and dreams seemed typical and cliche. Chevalier's other novels always had something unexpected, but this failed in that regard. I knew what was going to happen before the ending was revealed.I loved the descriptions of french life, but THE VIRGIN BLUE is missing the strength her other works have."
2,Didn't deliver,"This book had a lot to offer in someplaces but ultimately did not come together. The protagonist in the modern world never won me over, and the autor did not reslove what became of the person I learned to love in the story, old world Isabelle.All in all, this book felt like a draft that was hastily ended."
3,Disappointing,"This book feels unfinished. Many of the characters are not well drawn, especially the lead character Ella. I found her totally unsympathetic and quite a whiner. I really didn't care whether she resolved her many self imposed problems. The premise was intriguing but the book was choppy and the ending--after so many pages of prose--was abrupt and unsatisfying. What happened to Isabelle? Why did her favorite son leave her stranded on the road? Did she return? Many, many unanswered questions left me frustrated."
5,AWESOME!,I could not put it down. Chevalier puts you right in the room with her chacters and you feel all their pain and joys. This is the third book of hers I have read and she again has captured me. The historical accuracy mixed with her character builds make for a perfect read.
2,Contrived?,"Unlike other reviewers here, I have not read Girl With a Pearl Earring--not sure I want to, either. I found Virgin Blue to be somewhat contrived and unconvincing. Chevalier's characters suffer from underdevelopment, and I did not feel particularly invested in their (surprise!) intertwined lives. Actually, the only thing that kept me reading this book was my desire to learn if the plot was really as transparent and predictable as I took it to be (it was). Chevalier's intentions are admirable, but in this case her delivery is not."
2,Good airplane read.,"A little ""lite"" in the character department, sugary and overly dramatic in places. But an easy read, and quick, good for travel, and if you finish it, you'll have no qualms leaving it behind for the next person to read. More than one star, at least. I preferred the historical sections a bit better, but who knows how accurate those are, just easier to imagine it might be."
4,A mysterious treat,"I loved this book more than Girl With A Pearl Earring, my first Tracy Chevlier book. I was totally engrossed in the mystery and the suspense, and the way the two women were linked together. I did not find the character of Jean-Paul to be chauvanistic at all (as he's been described elsewhere) and I was rooting for he and Ella to be together despite her bland husband.I also found the historical part of the book mesmerizing and interesting. Chevalier really has a way of painting an amazing, enigmatic story.This was definitely one of the few books I've ever read that I was so sad to see end."
5,Better than Girl with the Pearl Earring,"It's very interesting to me to see the wide range of opinions on this book. Clearly, if you are a Tracy Chevalier fan you will like this book, but whether or not you love it will depend on the type of novel you generally enjoy reading. The Virgin Blue has much more of a suspense element to it, so if you enjoy reading suspense-type literature this will hold your attention more than Girl with the Pearl Earring. I enjoyed that novel immensely, but it took longer to get into than this one. And I must disagree with the reviewer who took exception with Ms. Chevalier's portrait of the French. Having lived in France for 2 years and travelled in other parts of Europe, I think the author's description of certain characters, while stereotypical, are accurate portrayals. In any case, I loved this novel and hope you will give it a chance."
4,Contrived coincidences of the French connection,"Well, it's not Girl with the Pearl Earring, that's for sure, but still, I liked this one. Perhaps it's the lure of midwifery that pulled me in (I'm a midwife and author of BABY CATCHER: Chronicles of a Modern Midwife, Scribner 2002), but I found the parallel stories of Ella and Isabelle captivating. Ella's story is told in present-day 1st person, while Isabelle's is told in 16th Century 3rd person. Both women are midwives, struggling with displacement and parallel desires. Ella is driven by a recurrent dream in blue, the typical blue color in which the Virgin Mary's robes are painted, to delve into her past and finds many coincidental connections with Isabelle.Worthwhile; not stellar."
1,A disappointment,"An interesting premise but clumsily executed. Reads almost like a draft. Characters are undeveloped, motivations are not plausible and main character, Ella, comes across as decidedly whiny, self-centered and not particularly likeable.Chevalier clearly overcame the problems evident in this first novel with her second book (the third was good but less successful). I wonder if this one wasn't rushed into print based on the success of ""Pearl Earring""."
3,entertaining but a bit amateurish,"I'd have to say that I agree with the general gist of the reviews. I found this book to be far less graceful than The Girl with the Pearl Earring, although it kept me interested nonetheless. The symbols that run through the book as well as the connections that Chevalier makes between Ella and Isabelle are a bit contrived and overdone. In addition, Ella's psychology and motivations are somehow not believable. They don't ring true. Nonetheless, one must remember that this is actually her first novel. And it is an engaging story that is certainly worth reading."
2,EllA was A SELFISH WITCH-HATED THIS BOOK,"I read Girl with A Pear Earring and couldn't wait to read this book.I was very disappointed. The main character, Ella, was a selfish and very unlikeable charachter. Really ruined the book for me because I really thought she was a poorly developed, shallow character, who was not well thought out at all. I couldn't really care less about her dreams or her life, I was really hoping she'd drop dead and her nice husband would find someone else.The historical aspect was interesting but the author tied the lives of these women together in a very halfhazard way. I felt the author was building to a climax that was supposed to be stimulating and exciting but was just confusing and fell very flat. A disappointing read."
2,Chevalier's success,"Ms Chevalier wrote a brilliant first novel: girl with pearl earings, and a second followed - Falling angels- which touched a different subject but was also a fantastic novel.However no author should rush to a third one as she did. I have the impression the commercial success pushed her to write a third one too quickly. The Virgin Blue has a good idea, a lot of research was done, but it goes so fast that the whole story quickly becomes fake, full of stupid coincidences that fall from the blue and make no sense at all. The end is sudden, uncomprehensible, ""invraisemblable"". A ridiculous finale! I am still rather angry with the end because it left lots of details unexplained, which is not Chevalier's style.Ms Chevalier, take an advice: slow down... and tell your publisher you have a name to preserve and that you will not be pushed to write ""just another novel""."
2,not as good as Chevalier's others,"I felt this book was a bit predictable and cliche. I enjoyed some parts, like the alternating storylines and perspectives, but as a whole, I did not like the book. I feel a little guilty about this as I enjoy Chevalier, but this book was just not for me."
4,Interesting Book,"Many have not enjoyed this book, but I did! I liked reading about two related women and their lives hundreds of years apart. I like the theme of having a connection with ancestors, and it makes me wonder what I do or say that is drawn from my roots.The main character was self-centered, weak and not particularly likable. Her husband was out of touch with her, but she didn't do much to help him understand what she was going through. He was uncomfortable with her skin condition, which I think was part of why she drew away from him.The book was an easy read."
4,Good deal.,My father loves the videos but makes him sad what was done to our ancestors. Any history buff should get this set.
4,"Good collar, but....","We loved this collar at first, until the puppy grew. She is a 6-month old puppy so she's growing like a weed, and this is her 4th collar so far. It is not a 14-20"" collar as advertised, as Lil's neck measures 15"" around and we had to cut the collar off of her since it doesn't have a clasp. It would not slide over her head, and we had it adjusted all the way out so I know it doesn't expand to 20"". This is by far the best style of collar, especially while training, but keep in mind that they do run smaller than advertised."
5,Gotta love Lupine dog products,We've had several Lupine dog products and this like previous is very good quality. This particular colar doesn't snap together it slips over the dogs head and then has a loop for shoker like capability.Lupine has replaced worn leasshes for us a couple of times now so we decided to try the colars also. Good stuff so far. We're very pleased.
5,"Strong Collar, Great Looking","Looks great, cleans easily and is very sturdy. Holds up really well to dogs playing rough at the dog park! I get a lot of compliments on it!"
5,Definitely the best!,"I had not heard of Lupine collars until I rescued a dog last year and she came with one, I changed the collar to a brand new one that I picked up from a local pet store and a couple weeks later my dog started having a reaction to the collar and had these unsightly hives on her skin. I took her to the vet and after about $300 later I found out she'sreally sensitive and the Lupine collars are the only ones that she doesn't have a reaction to. In addition to this, I don't know any other company that offers a lifetime warranty even if the product is chewed! The collars are made extremely well, not cheap at all! and I honestly don't think I would ever have to use their warranty for anything other than my dogs chewing it."
3,Does the job... but that color...,"This martingale-style collar is just what I was looking for. My dog is unable to slip out of it, which is the point. I hope that as it becomes more worn and softer, it will loosen more easily. After a few weeks of daily use, it is still stiff enough that ones the dog tugs so that the collar tightens, it will not release again. The color in the photo is a bit deceiving. The collar is a bright fuchsia leaning toward pink, with plum colored flowers. If I had realized just how very PINK this was, I would have selected a different color and style."
3,"GREAT product, missing ONE important feature...","I have had several Lupine collars and the product is absolutely the best there is. These can't be destroyed!! The colors stay sharp and it doesn't fray no matter what you do to it (and we're pretty harsh on our dog stuff around here).My ONLY complaint is that this collar doesn't have a 'click' buckle to open and close the collar, it has to be slipped over the dog's head. Kennels do not accept these types of collars and they're not ideal for dogs with great big heads (like mine). I assumed all Lupines had buckles on them and didn't even think to look more closely!!"
5,Fantastic company!,I've been purchasing Lupine collars and leashes for years and the company is absolutely amazing. The designs are great and the collars are study. If your dog chews the collar or like my dog is just really hard on it they will replace it. If that's not customer service I don't know what it! The product arrived exactly as described and on time.

4,Sharp knives,"Works great, is easy to use. Not the ultimate answer to sharpening your knives forever, but it does the job on a regular basis. Would purchase again."
5,Simple sharpener,I bought this as a simple way to keep my Global knives sharp. It will not put a factory edge back on the blade but it will keep them sharp and do so quite simply.
4,Easy to use,"This sharpener worked great, restored the lost life to my Global knifes that hadn't seen a sharpener in over a year. Only problem with it is the blade can get stuck if you put any pressure on it. I found it easiest to just let the weight of the blade be the only force applied, then just guide it with your index finger on the side of the blade."
3,"A good introduction, but an introduction only","For those who dont know what Six Sigma stands for (say, 3.4 unhappy customer experiences per million opportunities), this is a good book, especially if his/her company is not yet a practitioner of Six Sigma and he/she just doesnt want to appear ignorant in front of other business executives. It's short, but has covered, though briefly, the key tactics and tools. The ""key learnings"" section in the end of each chapter and Chapter Six ""The 10 common questions about Six Sigma"" are definitely pluses. However, if one really has to work it out, I am afraid this would not be the optimal choice.p.s. I am obliged to disagree with the author a Six Sigma Consultant's descripton of Six Sigma as the ""Most popular management philosophy in history"" and a surefire weapon for business warfare."

4,Very cute,I got as a gift for my brother - he collects these. I was a little disappointed when it arrived and was plain. I wanted some buckeyes on the helmet like you see on the players helmets. On Christmas day he opened and inside the helmet was a sheet of buckeye stickers. I was very pleased. Although the description should have told me that so I didn't waste my time looking for them.
3,Bizarre collection...,"What a weird selection of an actor's work. It would have made more sense if they did a Scorsese/De Niro compliation. Now there's a winning collection: Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Mean Streets, and The King Of Comedy.But if you're a fan of everything De Niro, this is a cost effective means of expanding your collection."
2,Blu RAY POOR quality,"Blu ray DVD movie Heat not very good quality packaging very cheap, I buy a lot of DVD's I will not"
4,A Decent Compilation,"I am a very big Robert De Niro fan. This has some of his greatest roles, but I strongly think that they should have replaced the Bronx Tale with Taxi Driver. Robert De Niro is one of the greatest actors to ever grace the screen, this collection shows us why."
2,"Love DeNiro, but bad selection of one of America's greatest!","What about Once upon a time in America, The Untouchables,Cape Fear, Men of Honor, The Godfather, Taxi Driver and 15 Minutes? I would have purchased this collection in a heartbeat if it included his best work. The films in this collection are good, but does not reflect his all of DeNiro's most popular performances (with the exception of Goodfellas). This collection is like qualifying for the olympics. A little taste of what you can do before you collect the gold metal. Analyze This should have been in a comedy pack along with Meet the Parents and Raging Bull. Wag the dog, although ok, should have been left out."
2,Choices could have been better!,"I only agree with 2 movies on this set. ""Analyze This"" & ""Goodfellows"", it would have been better if ""Once Upon A Time in America"" were included. They could have left out the rest, I'm sure glad they didn't add Rocky & Bullwinkle to this set. He is a great actor, and the choices could have been better, for that reason I give it 2 stars...."
1,Disappointed,"For such a great actor, I expected to see his best films-not a collection of his so-so films. The movies are good, but it's a huge diappointment to true De Niro fans."
1,What the He?? was that?????,These guys are not cool just goofy. The reviews here were definetely written by band menbers and or friends. Good if you like to hear primus mixed with rack a billie.... No thanks
3,not great,"I purchased this to help my son practice his math. It was fun for about the first 15minutes then he quickly lost interest. The positive points are that you can set the level and type of math problems and you can enter a set of your own problems. The bad part is that the game only consists of 3 short simple games that do not hold your interest. The pinball game is frustrating because the ball will hit the wrong answer while you are still working on finding the write answer which then messes up your ""grade"". My son (9) found it very disappointing. I would recommend finding another game with more content."
5,great game,I bought this for my nine year old. He has trouble in math. He loves it and it makes him learn to do his multiplication without counting on his fingers.

3,1.5 Charm,"Camelbak makes a great product. This is an excellent small pack, and is great for a short ride. The key area is what it says, it will hold a very small keychain. There is not enough room to carry a small tool kit, so keep that in mind. I will probably upgrade to a pack that has the bungees for a jacket and a little more room for tools. This pack is more geared for a teen, or a rider who has support."
4,Overall excellent hydration pack within limits,"I have found this to be quite adequate for trail runs and shorter bike trips. I am small, and it fits perfectly. My only problem with it is that the capacity simply is not enough for longer rides. It is okay on the trail runs as I normally in a location I can refill, but when you are out on the highway in the middle of nowhere, you want a bit more liquid than this one holds. On the plus side though, it rides well and is extremely comfortable. I solved the problem by simply buying different capacity units to use for different events. This is a good product, but I am marking off one star simply because it does not hold as much as I thought it would. Probably more my fault that the product though, I must admit. I should have researched a bit better. That is one of the problems you have buying online without seeing the actual product."
4,Great Fit,"I love the fit of the Camelbak Charm and I have very little bounce when running, even when the bladder is empty. I regularly use it on my runs. Anything over 6 miles though and I have to fill it up at least once...especially in when running in the desert heat. This can be annoying, but I plan my runs around where I know I'll be able to refill. Unfortunately it doesn't have nearly enough storage. I put my key and cellphone in the zippered pocket and keep my gels in my shorts pockets as that's about the only things that will fit in the Charm."
2,Not impressed,"This is small, so it fits nicely against my back for trail running. However, the mouthpiece leaks. This is quite annoying.Doesn't hold much water, so only good for short trail runs. I wouldn't recommend."
1,Too small,It sounded larger but 1 1/2 liters is pretty small. I wish I had gone to the store to see it instead of buying it online. I would not have bought a Camelbak this small. The small zippered pocket us barely big enough for a cell phone a driver's license.
1,silverware marks,These bowls catch every stroke of silverware that touches them. They mark up very easily (hundreds of silver lines) and have to be cleaned/polished with a cleaner that Pfaltzgraff provides. I'm going to buy some replacements.
3,"Spacey, diverse, mellow alt-rock","3 1/2 starsFocused, even in it's apparent lo-fi laziness of summer sloth, there are plenty of beautiful, soft ideas flourishing about, although many might not have been brought to complete fruition. Nevertheless, the breezy nature of the material serves the theme well, and all fans who seem disappointed in the face of greater, subtly intense musical statements on other records must step back and realize this is still an accomplished effort from a solid unit. The cheerful moods of the sun in summer are translated, distorted, and satirized all in an easy to digest format of pseudosunsoaked fun. For all it's simplicity, the production values imbue even the slightest melodic experiment with a tonal depth that gives more replay value then your typical straightforward alternative rock, which is one of the key ingredients that has helped separate this band from countless imitators."
3,"uh, what happened?","i was really looking forward to this album, but i'm fairly disappointed. for a rock album of 2003, it's very good. for a yo la tengo album of 2003, it's just okay.highlights: ""little lies,"" ""season of the shark,"" and James' song. overall, georgia's songs are the best.lowlights: track #3. in fact, nearly all songs that ira sings lead on simply aren't up to par. he's gotten into this faux jazz thing, which doesn't do YLT justice. they are a rock band, and sound much better rocking out than tickling the ole' ivories. but the problem isn't just with the new sound...it's also with the lack of inventive lyrics (see track #3).oh well...YLT are still the greatest modern band alive to me and i'll forgive them...this time."
1,What have you done with the real Yo La Tengo?,"A decade ago, YLT were crafting dense, textured, genius guitar rock built on layers of melodic feedback, elegant composition, and sweet (but dark) lyrics and vocals. This CD (and the last one, for the most part) sounds like they have been heavily sedated and/or hijacked by the band Luna (although without Luna's wit). The lightweight guitar strumming and breezy vocals on display here amounts to perhaps the most precipitious decline in any rock band since... well, since forever, as far as I can tell. Please, please, bring back the brilliant musicians who wrote Ride the Tiger, Painful, May I Sing With Me, and other stand-outs of intelligent rock music."
2,Uninspired,This CD is bland and unispired for the most part. It seems as though YLT has traded in the pop/distortion style of Electr-O-Pura and I Can Hear The Heart...for a slower/minimalist style that is dull and forgetable. Hopefully they will return to the more uptempo stuff they used to make.
5,YLT always one step forward,"Summer sun is the natural follow up to the most acclaimed ""And then..."" just for the moving cover of Big Star's ""take care"" with Georgia singing softly it would be worth acquiring this album. The rest is full of nuances which appear the more you listen to it.play it over and over and you will be amazed by the richness of YLT's sound.This is YLT at its best. Fresh sound for the forthcoming summer"
3,"good, not great","This is a fine album, and certain of the songs are real standouts - I particularly enjoyed the dissonant piano touches and acoustic bass work on ""Don't Have to Be So Sad."" However, Yo La Tengo is a band that has seemingly broken new ground with each new release to date, and this album doesn't quite live up to that standard, at least in my mind. As a rehashing, or refinement, of some of the ideas first presented on ""And Then Nothing...,"" it's excellent, and I appreciate the fact that they chose to create a work with not a single one of their trademark feedback-drenched rock tunes present.If you're a fan of their previous works, by all means add this to your collection. If you're curious about the band, try I Can Hear The Heart Beating as One, or Electr-o-pura, for starters."
4,Good western!,"This western was overlooked and underrated - probably because there are no brawls or shoot-outs which there normally was in the westerns of the 50's. Gregory Peck gives a fine performance of a gunfighter who wants to change his life - but the world won't let him. Quiet and believable with a good script, this western in B/W comes out pretty good and ranks among the best of the genre. A must for all fans of the western movies!"
5,Very Tight Anime Fighting Title,"I have no clue why someone could give this video less than 4 stars. It's one of the best action flicks I have ever seen. The dubbing was EXCELLENT and the animation was super smooth. The fight seens were incredible especially the special moves. They were bright and spectacular and the story was also cool. There is drama in this video but can be really funny at times. This video is well worth a look. Especially since its so cheap and its 90min! Can't beat that. Think about it...Scantily clad waitresses fighting, and the loser has to take it all off. I'd recommend it to 17+ since it does have mature situations. Great video! BUY IT!"
3,Variable Geo - An interesting take on the fast food industry,"Variable Geo is based on a fighting game, and for that reason alone I was unsure about how to aproach this video (anime based on fighting games don't have that great of a track record). The character designs in this video helped to enhance a story that sometimes pushed the bounderies of believability, providing the characters with an extreme amount of personality. The fights between characters were good, but be advised that there is a lot of skin shown (gratuitious fan service). This isn't an anime you should watch for a serious plot, but for those days when you want to watch something silly. Overall, a good video game translation, and worth looking into if lighthearted action is your genre of choice."
5,Good anime... well worth it!,All I can say is... this anime was good! If you have played Advanced V.G. 1 or 2 you will definitely like this anime! There needs to be a sequel!
1,Very Disappointing,"Although the visual quality was good, the story line was poor to non-existent at points. There was little combat and what there was ran by very fast and without and sort of challenge. This was not what I expected from a combat show.I was very very disappointed in this video, and would recommend NOT BUYING it to everyone."
2,Fatal Flaw: Takes a Silly Concept Seriously,"In 'Variable Geo,' waitresses who are also experts in exoteric martial arts styles battle in a series of matches to be named the world's battle queen. There's a darker side to the Variable Geo tournaments... and our heroines end up running headlong into it.I thought 'Variable Geo' sounded like a hoot, so I picked up up. The first ten minutes are the tone I would have expected... but after that, the concept of warrior waitresses is started to be taken seriously not only by the story, but, the episodes assume, by the viewer as well. It's a flaw that turns what could have been a fun romp into a rather excrutiating 80 minutes.To make matters worse, the first three episodes end on a cliffhanger. I imagine this means there's a 'Variable Geo II' on the horizon. It's a sequel that I at least will be ignoring.On the techincal front, the animation was average and the voice acting (in the English dubbed version) was slightly above average."
3,Technique de réparation et d'entretien des MB type 107,"Si vous souhaitez effectuer vous mme la restauration mécanique de votre mercedes type 107 à moteur V8, ce livre est pour vous. Moteur, freins, climatisation, faisceau électrique, c'est assez détaillé, mais il faut avoir de bonnes connaissances de bases... et un outillage de pro pour vraiment en profiter. Nombreuses photos NB, schémas, coupes et tout en Anglais, modèles US."
1,Not so complete,"I expected this manual to be as complete as other Auto repair Manuals, however I was rather dissapointed on that this manual was net very deep into system especially the the fuel injection. Stick to manufactures repair manual if you can or CD"
3,normal haynes fashion,it seems to be as complete as any Haynes books I ownit gives you the basics and some inportant infobut not complete
3,Pretty standard workshop manual,"Decent for entry level learning about the model and basic jobs, although the Mercedes factory manuals are better. The ones on CD are poorly scanned, so wait and find an older hardcopy on ebay."
1,BAD BAD BAD BAD,"By the time I received this book it was worth $35 and I waited a month for it to arrive. The book it,s self is probably worth maybe $2 and the contents a $1 so as you can tell I was not very impressed with the book"
2,anyone tell me ?,Anyone out there know if this book covers 380SL and 500SL 1981 model year onwards. Amazed that Haynes haven't seen fit to publish one or at least tag a section onto this book.
2,Aristocrats -- the miniseries,"If costumes are all you're looking for in a costume drama, then go for it, because you won't find much drama. There was something anachronistic in the perspective of this period piece, which perhaps could be attributed to poorly adapted source material and some smug voice-overs. I could find little that was compelling in these upper class historical characters, all unlikeable in their various unremarkable hypocrisies. Particularly puzzling was the portrayal of Sarah by Jodhi May, a blank performance that might have aroused sympathy for the character had she suffered trauma or brain damage. Since there was nothing in the narrative to explain such strange affect, it was merely annoying. All in all, this was a long, boring film."
2,Disappointing,"As a lover of alot of the BBC films By Austen and films by Dickens, I thought to give this film a try. Sadly, there are several things which put me off. One - they loop certain characters voices and it just doesn't work, especially the narrator's character who starts out as a young girl. Two - in the last part of the 4 part set, they literally changed all the actors!! I have never seen this before and it ruined the whole viewing experience. All they needed to do was to ""age"" the existing cast as usually done in these types of films- Instead they just replaced the actors for some odd reason. As they have taken the viewer through their entire lives, marriages, deaths in the family and changes in the world prior to the ending, to suddenly throw in new actors in all the main characters during the finale is really terrible. Also- I did not find much chemistry between any of the men and women who ended up married or even having romances. I would not recommend this one."
2,"Empty Characters, Strange Pacing","Based on a true story, Aristocrats follows an English aristocratic family, who claims royal blood and status via Charles II bastard lineage. The convoluted timeline in fits and starts, takes place prior to the American Revolution on through to the Irish uprising of 1798.The story starts out interestingly enough, but at about part 3 of 6 you begin to wonder if there is a point to the story. The last 3 parts are simply depressing. More than anything, the timeline begins to rapidly fly by without any specific storyline accountability nor historical grounding. The casting is odd in general. In particular, as the characters age, the casting changes are really horrible choices that offer no consistency or context of character and plot.If you've nothing else, you may find this a mild diversion. But all in all, this doesn't measure up to the BBC's standards."
5,If you love historical dramas...,"I just loved this series. Many historical/period pieces are old, or dry, or dull or whatever. This one was long-throughout the lives of I believe 2 generations. And it was certainly not dull! It was worth the money."
5,I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE, AFTER I BOUGHT IT I SAW IT ABOUT A HUNDRED TIMES THERE AFTER...IT IS THE MOST ENTERTAINING MOVIE IVE SEEN YET I NEVER GET TIRED OF WATCHING IT..I ADORE THE COSTUMES THEY ARE FABULOUS! I AM A HUGE FAN OF THESE TYPES OF MOVIES AND WAS GLAD TO HAVE BOUGHT THIS SET TO ADD TO MY GROWING COLLECTION."
4,Great story and visually stunning,"Not too much to say, except it was absolutely beautiful with the costumes and decorating looking so authentic. Storyline was pretty good, but I was honestly distracted by all the beautiful furnishings and costumes! Just gorgeous, will probably rewatch this set in 6 months time."
2,Flat Aristocrats,"Like many sagas, this series suffers from too many characters and too little development of characterization. Even the main characters are so dull and broadly drawn that it is impossible to feel either sympathy or revulsion for them. Like a soap opera, the plot merely rambles along, never seeming to progress toward any culmination other than the family's aging. Characters are sometimes introduced and killed off without any intervening significance to the action. There is practically no interaction between the master and servant classes, an element that usually adds interest to British period pieces. Those in service are treated as truly unseen, and the few Irish peasants presented are wooden props. If one turned off the sound and simply viewed the lavish, intricate costumes and settings, the series would probably be just as enjoyable."
2,The Book is Better,"I watched this on Masterpiece Theater and was intrigued enough with the family story to buy the book. The characters and the historical context are much better developed in the book and you don't have to listen to that extraordinarily whiny, droning music."
1,Disappointing,"I realize that the film needed to be true to the lives that this group of individuals lived, but I was very disappointed in the content. I do feel that the description should have warned that it would not be suitable for family viewing. I also felt bored by the content and couldn't bring myself to watch the second DVD."
3,"Not Bucket's best, but good","This is one of Buckethead's more experimental albums. This CD reminds me partially of Inbred Mountain and Kalidiescalp in the sense that each song seems to follow this formula: Riff>riff>solo>riff>weird-noise>riff. It was origionally a tour-only CD, and used to go on Ebay for ridiculous amounts of money. But it has been repressed and can now be obtained through Buckethead's official online store for a reasonable price at TDRSmusic.com"
4,cas,"Not bad. I liked season one through three better. More epsiodes, same price as box set 9, and better summury."
3,yes the show is amazing...BUT,"the price is just too much.buying what they call ""seasons 7 8 9 and 10"", which isnt even the complete story, is over $130. whereas i bought the full stories of season 1 and 2 for much much less.this is just a money grab plain and simple.nobody thats seen Bleach questions its quality. it hurts to put less than 5 stars as a rating, but i just cannot in good conscience put more than 3 stars as long as these prices stay this high.its the price thats preventing people from buying it, and its the price thats causing all the complaints. so please stop telling everyone to stop complaining..its just not right."
2,Long shipping time...,This product took a long time to arrive... unfortunately the baby is taking even longer and the pills aren't helping.
1,blue cohosh is a bunch of pish posh,"well, i was told that this product was supposed to help enlarge your breasts, but apparently it doesn't. at least for me, it didn't work. nothing against the seller. the shipping was quick and everything arrived as i was told it would. the product just didn't do what i thought it would is all."
5,Awesome,"Oh, my God. This is really awesome!!!!!! I love the sound, and the voice is incredible. The musicians are brilliant. The songs are so beautifully written. What a talent. This is not like any spiritual music I have ever heard before. It is like the Beatles went to church. I love this CD. Buy this and pop it on in your car on the way to work and it will help you sail through your day. Inspirational. Wonderful."
5,TOTALLY AWESOME TEASER!!!,"This is definatly worth getting. It has awesome songs and a cool thing at the end, but thats a surprise. I dont care if NOFX has War On Errorism comming out May 6th, get this teaser!!!! NOFX has totally outdone themselves."
5,Awesome NOFX ep,Best thing NOFX has put out in a while you get 4 new tracks it a teaser ep for there new album coming out in may i think it is. this has 4 songs and there all good and it has a 5th track advertising there new album.BUY THIS!
3,It's OK,"This is a bad teaser for nofx's worst album, The War On Errorism. Mediocre is a mediocre song, The idiots are taking over is an okay song but not that great and Franco unamerican is bad in nofx standards. Hardcore 84 sounds like an 80's punk rock song but with ridiculously polished production, not what I want to hear in a hardcore song. And the commercial at the end is pointless. It's OK."
5,A preview of The War On Errorism,"A band who shuns the media, with insularity and a fixed opposition to [success] is more quote-unquote ""punk"" by that idea alone. NOFX could be playing toe-tappin' countrified tunes about sowing your oats, but they would still be the real thing to me. With this short release, a justifiably cynical appetizer to their impending ""The War On Errorism"" album, you get Fat Mike, El Hefe, Melvin, and drummer Smelly fiddling with clichés while laughing at the ""scene"" on ""Medio-core"" (""how was the band, they were okay - not great, but pretty good - they played the songs I knew they would, some old some new, same formula stays true we can concur""). Yet when it all ends the whiff of creative disgust stays in the room with you. When their Rock Against Bush tour visits your college campus, you'll get to see the most spot-on-tight, and seriocomic speed-rock (new genre) laid to wax since, well, their last album."
1,False Conclusions reached by Ignorent Logic.,"As other reviewers have already pointed out the author makes a vain attempt to reduce the siddhis to nothing more than shifts in our everyday perception; no more than cryptic word games. The Author's conclusions are utterly ludicrous and are reached through no reasonable amount of logic whatsoever. He tries to explain away and pronounce dead wrong things that 2500 years of Indian scholars and Yogic Ascetics know to be fact. This is by far and away the most ignorant, westernized interpretation of any area of Yoga I have ever seen. I wouldn't be speaking so harshly if it weren't entirely warranted. Trust me. If you want to learn about The Eight-Fold Path and the Siddhis I highly suggest you look elsewhere."
2,Moderately Interesting,"This little book reminds me of the old Readers' Digest digests that one left on the commode. If you're in a hurry, and seek only the most ephemeral of companionship with THAT, then this book is for you. Otherwise, keep on shoppin'...."
2,Last Act in Palmyra,I am reading the Falco books in order and have been very pleased with the series to date. This one did not live up to the previous books. Repetitive investigation so much so that I put the book down several times from boredom. I will try the next book however.
3,"Eagerly anticipated ""Falco"" novel","As always, I eagerly await the latest in the Falco detective series. I was somewhat disappointed with this one however. I missed the usual sidekicks in this novel (Petronius, siblings, etc.) and found the novel to be a little long-drawn. Once Falco narrowed down his suspect list to two, it seemed to take forever to solve the case. I also missed the deity + metal title of the novel (although I guess she had to run out sometime). All in all, it was fair reading."
4,"Not the best Falco novel, but entertaining","Who killed Heliodorus, why has Vespasian sent Falco on yet another wild goose chase, is Musa the right hand of Anacrites and what is Helena Justina, high born daughter of a Senator, doing trekking across the sands of Syria with the impovershed albeit irristable rogue Marcus Didius Falco anyway? The Last Act At Palmyra is an entertaining read but don't expect any depth. I knew who done it halfway through the novel. I enjoyed Davis' style, but wish she would get back to some of the depth of the earlier novels such as Silver Pigs which wasn't as heavy on humor but had a lot more mystery to recommend it."
2,Not the best,"I really enjoy the Falco novels, but this one was disappointing. I purchased it soon after it was published, started it, but left it unfinished until recently. I finished it and started Time to Depart which returns to Rome. I feel that Last Act leaves much to be desired, but enjoy the other titles in the series. Keep up the good work."
2,A low point in an otherwise enjoyable series,"I have been happily ploughing through the Falco series over the past few months. This entry was most disappointing. It has Falco traipsing all over the far eastern reaches of the empire through town after town. Nothing much happens as Falco searches for a murderer in his midst and inevitably finds him. I found the travel to be repitious and I was bored by several pointless side plots.Also, is it just me or is this book particularly crass with language and blantant profanity? I'm not adverse to ""realism"" in my reading, but the tone of the books seem to have changed for the worse with this entry.I have the next in the series, Time to Depart, and am hoping for a return to form."
2,The only disappointing Falco,"The only misstep so far in a wonderful series. I was so eager for the book, I got a copy of the British edition, before it got to the US. But I was disappointed. Somehow this just just doesn't get off the ground. Could Davis be tiring of Falco? It seems to me that she is. Maybe it's time to DO something, Lindsey! Make some real changes in tbe characters' situations or kill them off. Real dullness in the supporting cast and plot, and the main characters (besides Falso, who always has a life of his own) pall."
5,Excellent and practical,This is the best book I have seen for Children on the topic of grief. It speaks simply and practically on this sensitive subject and is beautifully illustrated. The memory book section was particularly useful as is the guide for adults. A true must have as a resourse to help grieving children!
1,terrible,They should have put in the description that this is very biblical about the master creator not at all what I was looking for.
2,Lousy Purchase,It's filmmed in some lady's kitchen! I purchased hoping to learn something great and wonderful... but it's just a lady pretty much reading the wikipedia page in her kitchen. Very disappointed.
1,oooohhhh this is bad,"This was a way to make money putting out a really bad product, using the face of a beautiful boxer puppy.OOOOOOOHHHHHH this is bad!!!!!!!"
1,One big con,"Keyboard has great features but, unfortunately, it is coated with painting that contains lead. Lead is known to cause cancer. This is specified in the user's manual but not on the box. I think any prospect buyer should be aware of this fact."
5,Very good controller,This Semi-Weighted USB MIDI Controller it's much better than oxygen 61. If someone is thinking to buy a keyboard controller this item is and excellent device.M-Audio AXIOM 61 Advanced 61-Key Semi-Weighted USB MIDI Controller 9900-51413-10
4,Good board,I really like this keyboard. It's picked up natively in Live and windows. My only complaint is that it has some very complex features and comes with software that I'll never use. The enigma software didn't seem to have any use since my software worked with the keyboard automatically.
4,Good product with some minor flaws,"This is a good midi controller for the price. One of the complaints I have is that the keys are sticky when first played after any extended period of rest. The action is okay. I had expected it to have a little less of a cheap feel. I do wish the knobs did not feel so notchy, but I can live with it. Pads have to be hit with some authority before it registers. Overall board functionality is excellent and for an entry-level controller it is miles beyond using a mouse and computer keyboard only for programming. Product recommended - just remember you get what you pay for."
1,It'll probably die on you,"I got mine and used it about twenty minutes after getting it. Stuck it in the closet while I set up my studio. . . Couple months later pull it out to work on some piano stuff for a covers gig and, lo and behold, the magic blue screen.In the midst of trying to get support on it and it appears to be working. Stinks having to pay UPS to send it to NJ, but that's cheaper than getting another controller...I don't know how widespread it is, but I've seen cases across the Axiom line. Seems like Avid is doing repairs though.So, other than not working at all, this is a great controller. I'll follow up once I get to use it for more than Mary Had a Little Lamb on my laptop.Beware"
1,"Not the ""Perfect Fit"" claimed","The mirror was oversized - too oversized to work. If I took it to a glass company and paid extra to have it trimmed down it might fit, but that would negate the whole point of buying a ""perfect fit"" replacement to begin with. Was a waste of time and money. I cannot recommend this product."
5,Outstanding !,"Originally saw this movie on late night tv - had no intention of watching it, but after 10 minutes couldn't turn it off. The characters are fascinating, the videography accentuates the contrasting settings in which each of them lives. This has become one of my all time favorite movies!"
2,c'mon now -,"beautiful pictures form a pointed, narrow exposition of postwar Vietnam - Saigon, anyway. but content yourself with the pretty ripples, for peer through the surface and you'll see no fish. ""lyrical"" may be a worthy assessment, but let's temper that with ""languid"".."
3,"good for reading, bad for playing","This is an affordable book that is fine for following along while listening to the music being played by someone else, but very frustrating to play from for oneself. The book does not open flat on a piano stand, and keeps falling when the pages are turned. It needs constant propping up by other books, which interrupts passages that have not been memorized (especially for non-professional pianists like me with a poor memory). The Schirmer editions are a bit better in this regard, and the Peters and Kalmus editions open even more flatly than the Schirmer volumes. I will not buy a Dover piano book again for playing -- only if I intend merely to follow a score while listening. Dover editions are cheap compared with those published by other companies, but you get what you pay for."
5,Treasurehouse of Joseph Smith's Teachings!,"""Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith"" is the most important book any Latter-day Saint can own, outside of the Scriptures. His early teachings from Kirtland to the last days at Nauvoo are chronologically recorded and easily accessed. Included the famous ""King Folette Discoures,"" and June 16, 1844 sermon. This is Joseph Fielding Smith's most imporatnt work ever."
2,kindle version does not have page numbers,"the content is great but I wanted this book as a study aid. It is often cited and always by page number. The kindle version does not have the original page numbers, making it almost worthless for a reference. If the publisher would update it to have page numbers, which I believe are essential for a work like this, I could give it 5 stars."
4,Lifelike & Loveable,This is a well made life like Penguin.....Great for someone who adores the animal & prefers a stuffed animal to represent the real thing.
4,Plush Emperor Penguin,This is a beautiful plush toy that is crafted well. Very realistic. My son loves penguins and he will be so excited to open this for Christmas.
5,really just a biography of Lenin,"Amazon's page says this is from 1998. That was just a reprint. The original is from 1965.And it's mistitled. It's not so much a history of the movement so much as it is a biography of Lenin, but on that score it is superb."
5,Short Review,"After answering the poll about 2009 videos, I pulled out my American Belly DanceLegends to watch again. While I was at Amaya's Wise Woman Retreat in early2008, she had given us on overview of the project honoring these wonderfultrailblazers of American dance, so I was really excited to see the finishedproduct when it came out.Kudos to Amaya for doing such a wonderful job. Amaya fuses her narrative withbreathtaking photos and video, giving us a great overview of these pioneers ofAmerican belly dance. I was introduced to a few dancers that I had only heardof by name if at all. The video really helped me put many of the puzzle piecesinto place regaring our dance heritage.Thank you again, Amaya, for the many hours put into this labor of love and formaking the information and footage available to us. I highly recommend it toanyone interested in learning more about the hisotry of Middle Eastern or bellydance in America. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that there will be a Volume 2!"
2,All fruit but flavor is off!,"Love the idea of being healthy, but the flavor of this one isn't great. Like the sour apple better."
3,Good snack,"I probably would give the raspberry four stars if I hadn't tried the strawberry first, however they are good and wouldn't discourage anyone from trying them. We will probably buy them again, but not right away and only once in a while for a change."
3,Not my favorite,"Okay, I have to admit that I am not sure what I expected from this fruit snack but it is not my favorite. The texture is odd for me and a little challenging to eat. The calorie/nutrition value is awesome and the flavor is good. They are definitely convenient, easy to carry in purse/car/desk/etc... and the price is very reasonable. You may have better results than I if your expectations are lower to begin with."
4,Dionne Meets The Motown Sound,"Dionne Warwick working with the pioneers of the ""Sound of Young America""? This can't be good, but surprisingly it's one of her more consistent albums ever. Ms. Warwick stepped out of her comfort zone and showed the gospel-based soulful side of herself. Despite hating the album because it was recorded differently from the way Bacharach and David recorded her, she showed that she could hold her own with the soul shouters like Aretha and Gladys. This is an album worthy of a listen and ownership for your collection."
5,no excuse workout & great for traveling!,"I loved Kira's Total Body Tone dvd, so I got this one for when I travel. It's a great workout and you only use your body! I like that it is more athletic than pilates and that there are options to make it easier or harder. I also like the choices of a whole body or body part workouts.This dvd contained no music. I think omitting the music is a good idea, usually I find music on exercise videos can get monotonous, annoying &/or be a distraction.I would recommmend this dvd as a great workout especially when traveling!"
5,A great no excuse workout,"I like this workout because it is simple to follow at home and convenient. The two small workouts of upper body and lower body make it easy to fit at least one into my day. The instructor is no-nonsense, easy to understand and pleasant. I will definitely get more of her workouts!"
5,I LOVE ALMOST ALL HER CD'S.......,i wish selena never did die. all my friends say i look like her and i am 12 years of age i just wanted to say i love selena and she'll always be in my heart WE ALL MISS HER
5,The Best Selena Collection,This set is the best collection of Selena's music available. It contains selections from every period of her career. Many of the selections are not available anywhere else. This is a fitting tribute to a truly talented artist.
5,Selena was a shining star and still is.,"I love Selena. She had an enchanting voice that awed us all. Her CD is just superb with the glowing success of ""I Could Fall in Love"" and the title track, ""Dreaming of You"" which is a favorite of mine. Long time ago, I told my parents about the movie ""Selena"" and so we rented it. We were shocked by the ending and couldn't help watching it another time. My parents immediately went to the store and grabbed her CD. She has since been their favorite pop artist. I still find my parents and myself sneaking the CD into the stereo because it is just so irrisistible! Selena touched so many people and it is a shame she died. She was a beautiful young lady with a one-of-a-kind voice. Her melody fills my living room with rich music and the Spanish songs are even more vibrant. We will never forget the one and only Selena."
4,"Selena's ""Anthology"" is incomplete","...Gone from this set are the cuts that would've rounded it out, such as live tracks, some hits, some MORE English songs that didn't come from the crossover CD, et cetera. Also, the CDs themselves could stand to be a little longer. Each one is about 30 minutes long - not like the people who put this together were hurting for space to put some more songs into this set.Now, the good stuff: You can tell how old Selena was by the phrasing in her Spanish songs on this set. She sounds lovely as always, and this set is worth the money you'll spend. Some of the remixes on this set are worse than the originals; some are better. It's a mixed bag. However, I am not the typical Selena fan, so you won't get any gushy sentimentalism about how wonderful this set is simply because it's Selena. It is great, and it is Selena. ... it's actually very good. Buy it and judge for yourself."
5,Great find on Amazon,I own a beautiful entertainment cabinet with lit curio cabinets at either end. I proudly display all my treasures from aroundthe world in the cabinets that have built-in lights. I have however found it very difficult to find the proper bulbs for thelights. When I finally got smart and looked on Amazon I was thrilled. Great price and the bulbs last a good long time! I'm set for years ! Thrilled to have them !
4,Great Movie,"When my friend saw the movie & told me it was about gays, it took away from my enjoyment. If you watch it as just a movie about friendship, it is much more enjoyable and not as political. It's a good movie anyhow, though not quite as good as the book. It has good points that are brought up, and shows Mr. Gibson @ his best. I'd recommend it, but it's not a must- see."
5,"Watched this movie on a whim, glad i did","This movie was set in New England in the late sixties, but it could have been set at anywhere and any time with equal effect. What i took from this movie was an appreciation for education, friendship and loyalty. I think that we all have had a favorite teacher that inspired us and we could relate to. This movie is about a man that lived alone and struggled with a lot of guilt, with physical and emotional scars but had a rare chance to redeem himself as an educator, and a man, in a conformist affluent town that mocks and ridicules him because he has aweful scars on his face. MR McCloud (Mel Gibson) happened across a boy who needed help, both academically and otherwise, and made a man out of a boy, while helping to make the troubled boy's dreams all come true. The acting was impeccable, and the story was very touching. I love this movie and recommend it to anyone, if you are willing to risk a tear. Great job to Mel Gibson and thanks for a touching movie."
4,Heart Gripping Story,"Mel Gibson did an awesome job, as did Nick Stahl. The story line is heart gripping. You'll find your heart going out to both of the main characters that Mel and Nick play. I watch lots of movies, but am very selective as to which ones I'll actually purchase. This one definately made my ""To Buy"" List"
4,1993 Movie Well Worth Watching,"Amazon.com shows this is a 2004 DVD. That might be when the movie was released on DVD, but the movie is actually from 1993. This is certainly not a ""high-definition"" type of quality DVD. Honestly, the filming is not all that great. Having said that, the overall story is good, and I enjoyed it. None or really ""Oscar Performances"". But again, I still enjoyed it and thought that it was well worth watching. Even though I really wanted it to be a true story. . . It's not."
4,The Man Without a Face-Mel Gibson,"A well done movie. Good story about the truths of how people will jump to conclusions without finding out for themselves what is really gonig on. ""Pay attention to what and who your kids are talking to people!!"" I liked the acting in the movie all around and thought Mr. Gibson did a great job putting it all together."
2,Read the book instead,"Isabelle Holland's The Man Without a Face is a strong, daring work that deserves wider attention than its placement in the ghetto of ""young adult"" fiction. Unfortunately, Mel Gibson's film version does to the story what the car accident did to the visage of his character--disfigures it beyond recognition.Here the original is bowdlerized and trivialized. It's decent enough entertainment, but it should have been so much more.Read Holland's novel and skip the movie."
4,Oscar worthy film --- 2 thumbs up. Way up!,"If you have a good heart, you'll find this movie to be very warm and touching. This is as good as drama movies get. Not only can you learn a lesson from this film, at the same time it is a very entertaining film. If you want to see what a good actor is like, then see this movie."
3,It's a book of quotes.,"This is a collection of quotes. Quotes that are divided up and categorized under ""aspects associated with the Zen tradition."" Categories like:Be here now,Be yourself,Work,Creativity,compassion,joy,perseverance mindfullness, ....etc, etc, etc.I love quotes as much as the next quote lovin' gal. The sub title ""Tasty Morsels of Wisdom from Great Minds East & West"" actually means that there are quotes from everybody, everywhere. Great minds, yes. There are a lot of really good quotes here. But, it is a book of quotes. If that's what your looking for, then it's a great book!"
3,Solid DVDs for basic operation,"This DVD set shows you the basics of how to grow both indoor and outdoor - beginning with set up through curing and everything in between. However, it does not go into much detail regarding problems that come up. Also, the first DVD is really all you need. Most of the second DVD is a repeat but it does contain some new material and the third bonus DVD is just that: 95%+ of just showing you gardens Jorge visited. I would buy just the first DVD and one or two books of details instead of the three DVD set."
5,Another strong album!,"This 98 release from Los Angeles Azules is another example why they are one of the best spanish groups ever. Right when you play the first track (Me Haces Falta tu), you may never want to stop playing this CD. Although it may never come close the huge success thier ""Inolvidables"" album had, its still an excellent album. Get it ORITA (NOW)!!!"
3,Swing review,"Turned out to be simply not my kind of ""mystery"". Some of it got a little preposterous for me. I think it is overrated."
5,Great read succeeds on many levels,"""Swing"" succeeds because of Holmes deft handling of multiple levels of the novel. When narrator Ray Sherwood despairs, I was convinced of the emotional sincerity. The verbal humor matches the best of modern noir authors. The suspense and mystery are an important part of the novel and handled well, but the support from other aspects of the writer's craft make the book much more interesting and much more satisfying than typical mysteries.A special note must be made about the music that suffuses the book. Even without the CD, Holmes musical knowledge brings a depth that cannot be faked. As an amateur musician, I was fascinated to learn about the musicians' craft and life on the road as a musician in the hey day of the big band era. As of the date of this review, the songs from the book are also available at: http://www.rupertholmes.com/writings/swing.html"
4,Easy Reading,Enjoyed this mystery and found the author covered the San Francisco Bay Area very well in that time frame. Builds a story very well. Recomend for vaction reading.
4,Didn't See It Coming,"It took a while for this story to unfold, but once it did, it was great fun. I had never heard of the Golden Gate International Exposition, and found the historical facts and pictures to be an added plus to this quick paced book. I would have given it five stars, but the the author went into too much detail with the music composition stuff, and since I have no idea how to read music, let alone write it, those areas of the book left me a little confused.Highly recommended to jazz and swing lovers."
4,A fun fast read.,"I ordered this book initially because I love his music. What a wonderful surprise when I opened it and stepped into a different time and place. The detail was wonderful and the story kept me guessing until the reveal. I found out quite a bit about the industry, and the expo that I never knew. The characters are well crafted and you care enough about them to wonder about their backstory and their future. No spoilers here, you'll have to read it for yourself to find out the story."
1,P-Trap,Received Chrome P-Trap. When contacted the vendor said his website stated the item was chrome. Return was offered.
1,Not What I Ordered,I Ordered the DVD but was sent a VHS.I returned it with a note explaining reason and 2 weeks later received another VHS.....I gave it to someone who could use it........
4,Jabra BT130 Bluetooth Headset,This is a real value for the price. The only downside is that the blue light blinks all the time when the headset is on. Otherwise it is comfortable to wear and the sound quality is very good.
4,Good reliable BT headset,"Overall this headset is pretty good. It paired easily with my RAZR V3c and operated with no problems. At one point I changed the 'name' of my phone and the headset had to be re-paired with the phone. That took a little twiddling but after a few power cycles of the phone and handset it worked fine.My biggest complaint is that the earpiece isn't as comfortable as it could be. The part that sticks in your ear is just a large knob-like thing that doesn't have any contours to fit your ear shape; it just kinda leans against your ear. Other Jabra products I've used in the past have nicely contoured jels and I was hoping to be able to use one of those on this piece. The piece is not entirely uncomfortable; I only use it on my commute to and from work and it doesn't bother me too much, but I can't vouch for those of you wanting to use this 8 hours a day.Overall though I like it and for the price it does everything I need it to do and is very reliable."
4,Price Alert,"I got 2 of these free with my new phones, I opened one of them, the sound quality is great, it is light and fit well, the only negative point is its white color rim. if you don't mind that you can get it new for 31.99 listed on Amazon.com under Electronics (seperate from this one)"
2,Surprisingly poor design,"I use lighting devices like this every day to light candles at our bed & breakfast establishment. I was excited when I saw that Zippo had put one on the market because I was aware of Zippo's reputation for elegantly designed, reliable lighters. I have been disappointed to discover that although the thing looks pretty and appears to be well-made, it is clumsy and awkward to operate. The safety button is in the wrong place to be comfortably depressed while striking the lighter. Compared to other devices of this type, the Zippo does not have much distance between the flame and your hand making it difficult to light wicks that are down inside jar-type candles. Also, the fuel-level indicator is nearly impossible to see making it difficult to know when the thing needs re-filling. I am much happier with way cheaper such devices that are more versatile, user-friendly, and ergonomically designed."
1,The Worst,"I haved had the same problem as the previous reviewer. Low to near non-existent flame, even on high. I added more fuel, but to no effect.Leave this one alone."
5,"Wonderful, Expensive, Indespensible","I absolutely love this spatula. It is small and thin and flexible. Even though it is flexible, it is a lot sturdier than other flexible spatulas I have tried. I can wash it in the dishwasher. It feels good and well balanced in the hand. The handle is nice and easy to grip even with a slippery hand. I use it all the time now that I have forsworn plastic and non-stick utensils and cookware. Unfortunately it is terribly expensive. I also own the larger version (the fish spatula) and it is also good but I find this one more useful."
3,"Great functionality, but NOT stainless!","We had this fabulous little fish spat for a little over a month when we started to notice surface rust along the handle and neck! What a disappointment because up until that point we were using this for just about any cooking application you can imagine. It's definitely versatile, and its small size makes it easy to maneuver into small cooking spaces like stoves, etc.If you can stand to look at surface rust on a supposedly ""stainless"" steel product, it might be worth getting, but at the price global charges for this, it wasn't worth it and we returned it to amazon within our 30 day window."
2,ONLY FOR DIE HARD BRUCE LI FANS,"This early Bruce Li movie is a biography of Bruce Lee but a very ill researched one. When Bruce Li made this movie, he apparently wasn't very good at martial arts and like all of his other movies that were made around the same time as this one, the fight choreography is awful. Some of the far too few fight scenes feature Li wearing a hair piece and these fights appear to be cribbed from another movie. There are two versionsof this film. The other one is now impossibly rare and is entitled ""The Bruce Lee Story"" which features a completely different dialogue track. The ""Bruce Lee A Dragon Story"" is reccomended. To be honest, I don't reccomend the film at all unless you're a big Bruce Li fan"
2,Meh,"I've read a few books by Leanne Banks and they all seem to have the same lead men and women. Women who are shy but have unexpected bursts of gusto, are virgins, and always putting themselves down until the male shows them they are special--felt more simpering than simmering."
1,Invalid Serial Number,"Beautiful game, if you own a PC. After recently purchasing a MacBook, I decided that Civilization III was a must have for my new computer. After installing this game on my mac, I found out the provided serial number was invalid.Ratings:Aspyr-0 out of 10Civilization III-9 out of 10ASPYR STOLE MY GAME!I will probably torrent this game, as I purchased it legally, and was given a broken game."
1,software does not work on newer Macs?,"Shipped on time but thisproduct does not work on my 1 year old MacBook pro - I have re-installed it several times, no response from Aspyr on problem."
4,Civ III Complete for Mac,A classic game formatted for the Mac. Still great to play the older version versus the newer Civ IV and V renditions. Does take some drivers/mods to play on the new Macs. Aspyr games rep helpful with these issues.
3,fighting is bad,i found that the defence on all the units is massive compared to the attck. and the bombardment feater is pittifull it takes the point out of cannons. overall the games defencive nature made it way too easy. i could beat the game easly with a few highly concentrated attaks and waiting and waiting and waiting. the diplomatic relaitions was made much better but one had to have ten units to take down 2 fortifyed units in a city. (exagerated) this made the game imposible easy if you played peasfully and defencivly but imposible if you play all all out war. you just grind forward inch by inch and it becaums more a resorce war then stratigy. i found i was bord with all dificultys fast. i however loved civ2 with was great and much more dificult.
5,i have a question,i used to have the origanal civ three and it was great. does this run on a mac g5? on the product page it says mac but on the checkout it says windows dvd. ??? is that normal or am i acedentally going to buy a microsot game???
2,Disappointing,"Civ III is a wonderful game -- if it'll run on your Mac. The box is seriously misleading (it says it supports iMacs), with the result that I bought it for my new Intel iMac, only to have it crash and crash hard every time a city changes hands. I contacted Aspyr and they inform me that there is no fix available. I am a diehard Civ fan but I'm pretty disgusted by this."
3,Just like PC - but read on...,"This game will not support fullscreen play on a MBP. I called up the company and they told me the video card that is in my MBP is not supported because it was not available when the game was released - note to them: No video card still in use was out when this game was written a decade ago. I have this game for my last PC that still works.Game play is just like PC, just the buttons are different. Really wish I could play it using my entire screen instead of a 8""x9"" window. I have a really large screen, and can only play using less than half."
2,WeloveEnglish,"This book was written by a crazy lady, with 7 chins. I'm sure it will enrich many children. I loved the part where the llama eats the woman with several chins. It wass my favorite part. peace out homie G!!!!!!polonium"
5,My wife loves it,She loves to look up the history of common phrases. Would make a great gift for anyone at any time!!
5,Brings back old memories,This is a nice robot that brings back nice memories of watching Lost in Space in the 1960s. These are old items so they are all of variable quality due ti their age and condition after storage. It even talks and can be set to detect movement in a room to sound an alarm. Anyone who loved the Lost in Space tv series will love this item.
1,Boring...,Boring and horrible even by B Movie standards. Why did they even bother making it?It's Just a bunch of Jersey/New York Trash with annoying accents. Nothing Scary.
2,Oh PUH-leeze!,"Bffff. I gave it two stars, maybe it deserves 2.5 stars. But it's definately not worth OWNING - no matter how cheap. It's all about an old ghost tale - which would be worthy of a move, just not this one. The acting's bad - they tried to make the movie all about suspense and fear, but they failed! OH, and . . . WAY TOO MUCH SPITTLE!"
2,B-rate horror movie,"This film has enough suspense to raise the heart rate a bit, but one is never sure of the what/where/why of the monster(s). Suspensions need resolutions, and this movie offers none. If you are out of coffee and need a bit of stimulus, watch this movie; if you are looking for a decent plot behind your dose of thrill, go to the store and buy some more coffee - coffee gone, coffee bought. Ahh ..."
2,"Oh dear, dear me","I was SO looking forward to seeing this. Had read some very promising reviews (although it seems that people involved with the production like to write rave reviews all over the place for Dante's films!).I could overlook the ropey acting and the cliches if the film actually went anywhere.It has the lamest plotline and ending that I've seen in a film for years. Yes it does capture a feel of horror films from days gone by but unfortunately, it's all the sucky ones!Ellen Sandweiss should have saved her return for something better!"
1,Satan's Cheese factory !,"I love all types of horror movies but this movie fell VERY short of my high expectations of it. Having liked what I read on the dvd's back cover and having paid $12.99 for it I really thought I was in for a treat. But after watching this demented effort at horror I felt ripped off, lol. This movie was boring cheese. The movie had bad casting and was very slow moving. The characters and the story line was completly pointless. I like horror and I like cheese but I wasnt expecting this movie to be so cheesy. This movie now sits in my DVD cheese section right next to movies like ""Chopping Mall"",""Trick or Treat"", and ""The Gate""."
3,a great treat,this is a horror film for real horror fans. dante is a genius and i thank him for bringing back real horror films. it is not the camp garbage that hollywood has been sending us. john c
1,"MY OPINION,","I picked this movie up at WAL MART for 19.79 plus tax. I wish I would of read Frank T Miller;s review on this movie before I opened it and watched it because I may have taken it back to get my money back. I watched this movie expecting it to be a knock-out horror flick. The mute so called psyco female in this moviedid nothing speechwise but give that giggling oF HE HE HE, HE HE HE, Like in the evil dead movies. It's a movie that if your a new watcher to horror flicks it might give you a BUZZ but all veteran horror fans forget it. It's a movie I would never waste my time to watch over again."
4,"""I.... await your...punishment....""","For Americans, young British viewers, and fans that haven't seen this serial since it aired, well, you're in for a treat. The TARDIS crew lands on Earth in the future, only to discover that the world is in another ""ice age"". Meantime, scientist from the Britanicus base have uncovered aliens beings frozen in a glacier! Episodes 2 and 3 may never be discovered, but the telesnaps with audio, and the CD help flesh out the missing footage(much better than ""The Invasion"" release). All the regulars are in fine form, especially Deborah Walting as Victoria, proving she's more than a pretty face. The guest cast isn't that bad. Clent is great, unable to admit that the computer might not know how to solve their problems. And let's not forget the Warriors, with their hissing and huge pressence. Like ""The Seeds of Death"", it's also has a wonderful soundtrack. The dissident vocals during episode 1 give a creepy feeling throughout the story. Great design. Not to be missed!"
3,A Better Troughton Serial,"This story really is one of the better second doctor episodes. I never saw an ice warrior episode and found it to be an excellent introduction to these menacing monsters.To fill the gaps there is a narration with stills. I believe its one of the best narrations available and really does a very good job on summarizing the missing episodes. It also comes with the audio for these episodes which is a nice treat.If you are a Troughton fan, you'll love this video. If you are like me and dig the colour episodes, you'll still love this episode. It is a great introduction to the Troughton era."
5,"Pat Troughton's Doctor a marvel in ""The Ice Warriors""!!!","It took several years, but Patrick Troughton's doctor has completely won me over. Not that I did not originally like Pat's performance. From the start,I enjoyed his Chaplin approach tothe character, his ability to use brain over brawn to defeat his enemies. The problem is that there are so few complete serials of his era (the number to-date is only six). This is why ""The Ice Warriors"" is a complete joy to watch! The very first Ice Warrior story is a good, filled with suspence, solid supoorting characters and quips of humor. Still, the reason to buy this is tape is Troughton. Well established as the doctor at this point, Pat does a remarkable job of mixing humor, believable fright and underestimated self-confidence into the doctor that it reminds us what a superb actor he truly was. A must for all Doctor Who fans!"
5,A pleasure...,"Until this video came out, there really were only 5 different adventures that represented Patrick Troughton's time as the Doctor, sadly they do not represent the best of his time. This adventure does. Although parts two and three are missing, the accompanying CD (located underneath the wraparound label along with a 48 booklet of neat facts) gives the complete soundtrack to the episode and since you do see episode, 1, your mind can easily ""see"" what's happening while listening to parts two and three, losing basically nothing. But even so, they cover all the bases, giving a pictorial recap/synopsis of the two missing epidoes. Truly a treat which I think we'll see more of. Sadly not every adventure has the luxury of missing only a few early parts, leaving the meat intact. Still, enjoy!"
4,"A nice look at rare ""Who""","On it's own, a solid (if unremarkable) episode, uplifted by the fact that there is so little available from Troughton's era. (Due to bad luck, I don't think I've ever seen an entire Troughton story, except for his multiple Doctor ones.) Despite the bad science in the writing, the possibility of another Ice Age in the near future is very real (even with global warming.) The Martians themselves are way cool! The soundtracks for episodes 2 & 3 are fun, like listening to a radio play. I'm glad this is now part of my collection."
5,A treat,"It was really nice to see this finally on video. Troughton is a great Doctor, and the Ice Warriors are among the best foes (even though they never appeared again after the Pertwee years). This is their first encounter. Although two episodes are missing (lost), the video does a very good job of filling them in with stills and narration."
2,Did I miss something?,"While this was an easy read and well written book, I felt like Nouwen kept repeating himself throughout. I don't doubt his experience and am happy for him that he found such peace and definition for his service in life. But as for myself, it did nothing to further my spirituality or make me feel comfortable or peaceful about death. This came highly recommended and I wound up speed-reading through the last third of the book to get through it."
2,Not so good,"I rented this because...well I honestly don't remember why. It was okay at the beginning and then it just got weird with people floating in the air, dead whales on the beach, walking on water. It was just a little too weird as I said. I don't reccomend it. It wasn't very good. I would reccomend Charmed though if you like this sort of thing, now that is a cool witch show.Another note, I practice Paganism and I wasn't the least bit offended by this movie. It's all in good fun..."
2,"""MAN CREATED GOD. THIS IS OLDER THAN THAT.""","How I'd love to recommend a movie with that line in it, but The Craft is simply not that well crafted. It's your average bubblegum teen angst flick about three vexing high school girls with Like Whatever accents and disheveled hair. The DVD promised wiccan horror, and it is probably a gallant effort for its measly budget, but nothing here really for anyone but standpat Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans."
1,Shameful,"This movie has as little to do with actual Witchcraft as the Lion king had to do with actual lion life on the Serengeti. This movie was not about Witches, it was about ignorant people using Magick towards selfish ends. Using magick does not make one a Witch. Following an incredibly ancient religious philosophy that precludes harming others does. I have personally known some very powerful Witches and if they or I could do half the things these children did in this film, we would not be persecuted as we have been for the past 2,000 years."
4,Chic,Almost gothic and minor classic witchcraft flick starring Neve Campbell in a coven of witches. I thought it was very cool and chic.
5,Craft for Cassie,"This product was recieved in perfect condition, and with a very quick response time. I would recommend this seller to anyone."
2,Not quite,"As a practicing witch/wiccan, I can say that this movie does a terrible job of portraying the Craft. As Hollywood drivel it does a fine job of stimulating the imaginations of 15-year-old girls. However, the extreme innaccuracies in this movie have only made ignorant people take my religion less seriously. If you are a witch, this ludicrous film will give you a chuckle, however, once you stop and think about it, you will be equally appalled."
2,"Not exactly ""magic""","This movie had a strong story line; it could've been good.But sadly its focus on darkness and death kept that from happening. It put true magick -the Craft- in a very bad light, in my view. And the ending showed the only really likable character (Sarha) turning dark & vengeful.True Wiccans will not be happy with this director's portrayal of their religion."
4,"Nice entertainment, poor witchcraft portrayal!","When this movie came out I was very excited! 'Finaly a nice portrait of witches!' I thought. But when I finaly saw it it came to be a deception in that matter. I study pagan religions and been into wicca for some time, and I can tell you wicca/paganism has got nothing to do with that mumbo jumbo the girls do! I only liked the occult store witch, she had something to do with the whole subject. Still, even if you know what wicca's all about, you should abstract from it and see this movie, because it's very entertaining, specialy if your a teenager in his/her wild years, but hey! don't go and fall into that misconception about witchcraft! If you're willing to go deeper into it read some good paganism books first!"
4,a great pagan morality tale,If you are trying to teach older pagan kids the consequences of negative magic this movie is excellent. A member of Los Angeles Covenant of the Goddess was their technical advisor and while she couldn't prevent every error she did what she could. All the basics are there plus its a pretty good story.
4,"Good, but a bit unrealistic.","I think this is one of my favorite films of all time, but I'm just getting into Paganism and I think this film goes against everything to do with the religion and they totally abuse their powers. Yet it's still a good movie, it's just a shame that so many people see this film as real witchcraft."
4,A fun flick,"I have been Wiccan for several years now, and I have to agree that The Craft is not a very accurate example of the Pagan religion. However, it did not offend me in the least. It's a fun movie, no matter the accuracy of it, and the underlying story deals mostly with everyday teenage life, and what we have to go through. There is also an important moral included in the story, about not letting power and greed destroy you.Fairuza Balk, who plays Nancy, was and is a practicing Wiccan. While she, too agreed that the movie was not completely accurate, she had a fun time making it, and I see no reason why others shouldn't have a fun time watching it. This movie remains one of my favorites, and I never get tired of watching it."
3,Offensive to Wicca,"This movie was quite offensive to the Wiccan religion. First of all, they kept showing those so called witches in black clothes, when in reality Witches dress like everybody else. (I do, anyway.) Second thing, real Witches NEVER cast spells to make someone's hair fall out, or to make one fall in love with another. Ever mind the rule of three, what you give out comes back to thee.....those witches seem to have forgotten that. But I like how they used phrases like ""blessed be"" and ""perfect love and perfect trust"", that makes the movie somewhat more authentic. And I'm glad that they did a movie about witches altogether. Even though ""The Craft"" was insulting, like I said before, it was interesting and catchy at the same time. That's why I gave it 3 stars--for creativity and interest."
3,Not Bad,"The sort of film to watch when bored, so long as you don't think that is what witchcraft is about.scary in bits with a little humour, one to watch when nothing else is on."
5,The Best Witchcraft movie EVER!!!!,"This is the best witchcraft (wicca) movie I have ever seen. The whole plot is good and it gives witches a good name **for once**. It sets some things straight, like the myth ""witches 'worship' the devil"". We **cause I'm a witch too** do not worship Satan or anything evil, and this movie helps to prove it. And it has a moral to it. If you break the law of three, **in other words if you abuse the power you are given** you will be punished. So if you are planning to buy or watch this movie, I suggest you do. Merry Meet and Blessed Be. -BuNnY"
4,The Craft - Awesome!,"The Craft is a great movie. It's much better done than most other movies with a witchcraft theme because it's not a comedy, like ""The Witches of Eastwick"" or ""Hokus Pokus."" The special effects are good. Send me an email and I can tell you a true story about what happened to the cameras and crew when they tried to film the ""invoking the spirit"" scenes!I give this movie 4 stars!"
4,Fairuza Balk deserves more credit!,"Fairuza Balk made this movie great. If it wasn't for her, i probably wouldn't have liked it nearly as much. She's an amazing actress. And she was definitly perfect for this role. There is something about that beauty of hers that is kinda of dark and creepy, but in a good way. She is the only ""witch"" out of the group that sort of makes it look real.Overall the movie is good, definitly worth a watch!"
4,A Younger Practical Magic,"I loved this movie. A lot of the genuine practitioners say this movie gives the craft a bad name. I'm a practitioner and I loved it. If they tried to keep it real we'd have a movie about the girls going into the woods to work on personal development and discover their relationship to the cosmos. Most pagans I know LOVE campy witch movies. We liked Bewitched, Witches of Eastwick, and Elvira and we were never confused about whether it was real religion. As to the claim that the movie misrepresents paganism... people who use this movie as a reason to hate witches were really never going to come over to our side anyways.Good movie and the two main characters interacted well."
4,Pretty Good,"This movie is very entertaining. It remains true, for the most part, to the basics of witchcraft. It illustrates very well the 3 fold law. Those who have been offended might want to consider the portrayal of Good Witches, not only Sarah but also the shopkeeper, who seems to be a true witch who follows closely Wiccan laws."
1,I've rated this before as ONE STAR. I'm rating it AGAIN as ONE STAR.,"The disk came in scratched. If I were to return it it would cost me more than buying the original disk did. Why am I reviewing this twice? I gave it a one before. I'm giving it a one, AGAIN.ONE STAR for scratched DVD."
4,Over all good deal,"To be honest I haven't watched the movie yet, but the movie was in great shape. It doesn't show any sratches, and my friend watched it so it must work good. The price was great. an over all good deal."
3,Angsty Blast from my High School Past,"Yes, it's a little over-the-top and angsty, but so was I and most of my friends in high school. The movie is a lot about fitting in and about bullies and about not falling prey to all the b.s. And, of course, about witches and magic."
3,Movie is entertaining but it's not real Witchcraft,"Movies is about fantasy and of the imagination. Make sure you take that into consideration when this movie discusses the Witchcraft magic. It's made-up and therefore not true. But other than that, it's a good movie."
3,I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY DUMB..,"HERE YOU HAVE 4 HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS WHO PRACTICE WITCHCRAFT. SOUNDS GOOD, BUT THE MOVIE DOESN'T LIVE UP.YOU HAVE 3 GIRLS WHO START THEIR OWN GROUP BUT THEY NEED A FOURTH GIRL TO BRING THEIR POWERS TO THEIR GREATEST. YOU KNOW, EARTH, FIRE, WATER AND AIR. THEY GET THE 4TH GIRL, AND THEN THEIRS LIKE A BIG POWER STRUGGLE BETWEEN HER AND THE ""LEADER"" OF THE GROUP. THE ENDING IS OKAY, AND THE POWER STRUGGLES BETWEEN THESE 2 GO FOR PRETTY GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS. I THINK THE STORY SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. THESE FOUR GIRLS ARE EXCELLENT ACTRESSES THEY JUST NEEDED SOMETHING BETTER FOR THEM TO GIVE THEIR GREATEST."
2,Interesting but not Accurate,"I have a love-hate thing with this movie. When I first saw it I just got scared but in the past few years I have come to reasearch Wicca and now this movie just irritates me.The cast is fine, the plot is fine, the special effects are fine. But...it promotes an idea which some people have been trying (very hard mind you) to get rid of for over 100 years.Wicca and Witchcraft in their original form are not like this at all. The closest this gets is right at the end where one of the girls sees that good is the only way.The rest of it is Hollywood junk being promoted and once again it is Wicca which sufers. This is the reason for my 2 star rating and the only reason it got 2 is becuase it is the storyline and not the actors or their work which I don't like. If you look at this movie completly on it's own then it is quite good and sometimes nicely scary.But I can't get past the terrible stereotypes which keep coming up so 2 out of 5 is what it gets."
3,Fiction at it's most entertaining..,"This is a film made purely for entertainment purposes. I can undestand why some people wouldn't like this movie, as I am a witch(not the back-stabbing 'paranoid' black magick type) and I find it offensive at times about how witchcraft is portrayed.Other than that, great acting by Neve Campbell and Fairuza Balk(a real witch too!!). Basically tells the story of Sarah, a newcomer to a Catholic school who is eager to make friends and incidently turns up in the wrong crowd. Some truth in it of course, but mostly just promotes the message that witches they can get whatever they want, whenever and however they want whether anyone likes it or not. Includes a cool levitation scene and some special effects. Not the most startling movie but a must see if your into the whole mystical and rebellious teenage stage.."
5,The Best Witch Movie Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I feel that the story was well planned out and that the actors really fell into their parts. It was a sexy and on the edge of your seat movie. I wish that Hollywood would come out with more movies like this one. The quality was amazing.
4,Witch power!,"The Craft starring Neve Campbell is a cute, fun, and edgy comedy. Robin Tunney and Fairuza Balk also star, I really like this film, has great energy and the plot is pretty cool. Sometimes I wish I could be a witch, lol. I highly recommend this chick flick fantasy, enjoy!"
4,Modern Classic Nastiness,"I love this movie, after purchasing the DVD and watching it again I have to say it's close to a modern classic as you can get with this type of movie. Thrilling, sometimes scary, often just nasty bitchness that is fun and entertaining."
4,"Not to be taken Seriously, but lots of Fun! Great Sp.Effects","This is, quite possibly, one of the goofiest portrayals of Witchcraft I have ever seen (and I live with a Witch). However, despite the fact that there is not one accurate reference to ""The Craft"" in this movie, it has inspired an amazing number of young girls to seek Literature about the subject and has broken-down a lot of the silly barriers to discussing the subject. Anyone who takes this movie seriously may need counseling, but it is great fun! The characters are perfect for their parts and I must admit this is a very...um, ""visually pleasing"" film. I really enjoyed The Craft and I know countless young women who have been affected by the film. However, one must keep in mind: This is JUST a movie & Hollywood's version of Witchcraft. If they were really like that I would not be living with one! Anyway, have fun and enjoy the mythical adventures of these teen ""Witches,"" then buy some books to comprehend the reality of Witchcraft."
1,Horribly OFFENDING,"If you are going to make a movie called ""The Craft""(which IS a religion by the way), then make one about another religion. Call it ""Judaism"", and fill it with lies about Jews! If that last statement was offensive then you can see why we as Witches are offended by this movie."
1,Which witch is which,I do not understand how this video deserves a star. It is one of the most flakiest movies I have ever seen. Ok a girl does some magic trick with her pencil and ta da! She's a witch! And how corny is it to use your powers on a guy to get him? Don't waste your time watching this video because it really sux.
1,GIVE ME A BREAK,to tell you the truth some of this portrays real witchcraft but some of that stuff makes me laugh i know from experience. i practice it. it was a good movie but it isn't real. i am real and so it true witchcraft
1,Lame,"This isn't a horror movie although it claims itself to be. It's more like an epsiode of Dawson's Creek with Samantha from Bewitched thrown in. If you like real horror movies, run from this one. Seriously! Tom C."
1,Anyone who watches this movie is pyscho!,"If you watch this movie and liked it you are pyscho. This movie had no plot value except to try in cash into the teen movement that was started with ""Clueless"". This movie was one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen."
2,Oh please!,"This *wasn't* a very good movie on it's own merits, and the only reason it got so much attention was because it was a well-promoted flick about a controversial topic. The acting is barely passable, the direction is lousy, and the only outstanding thing about the movie is the soundtrack!Furthermore, anyone with any sense can tell that this movie is NOT about Wicca or the Craft, but is Hollywood's concept of what will sell a movie. If you're in the mood for some fluffy mindless entertainment, this movie is for you. If you're interested in learning about the Craft as religion or magic, buy a few good books and remember that movies are pure fiction!"
1,Not what I expected,"Think twice before you watch this movie. It may seem like a harmless school magic chick flick, but this is a deranged movie with a deranged plot. There is nothing fulfilling about this movie."
4,This movie is really good and is worth checking out!,"The Craft is supposed to be a horror movie but like some horror movies now it's not very scary. The story line's really good though, a girl called Sarah moves to her new school, Eastwick high,she runs into 3 girls, known as the bitches of Eastwick, who have a vast interest in witchcraft. The girls are really nice to her at first but then turn evil on her."
3,"Unrealistic, but entertaining","This movie was okay for entertainment value, but in no way was any of it real withcraft. I study wicca myself, so this movie was just a little annoying to me. The flying around, crazy wind, and changing of face, eyes, hair, whatever was just way too fake. Witchcraft is a very carefully practiced ritual through positive faith in your prayers and meditations. Nevertheless, I have the DVD and it is a pretty good movie. For those wannabe witches out there though; I suggest you buy books on real wicca, tarot card reading, palmistry, getting in touch with your inner spirit or guardian angel just to get started, instead of trying to copy this movie. The things that the girls in this movie are doing (light as a feather, stiff as a board) are things that me and my friends were acting out when I was 12 years old!"
4,craft,goood movie! Nice flashback from the past. I got it for my teenage daughter as a gift and she loves it too.
4,Teen Angst with a magical twist,"Dozens of movies & TV shows were made about the angst of being a teen in high school - especially when you don't belong to the popular crowd.The Craft tries to give it a little twist - what happens when the least popular girls in school get their hands on some sort of power - and become witches? Can they handle the power and use it wisely?The cast is young and talented, and the disk has many special features, including a director's commentary."
5,Good movie,"I really loved this movie, despite all the critism it received from the real wiccans. It has a good plot and good characters, even some character development. This is meant to be a FUN movie, not realistic. In the movie the girls never mention Wicca, but only witchcraft/black magic. I can understand that it does not portray everything correctly, but is hollywood ever accurate? I am a Christian, and I have watched a few movies that are wrong. Take the exorcist for example, the main priest smokes and drinks. Priests are not permitted to do these things, atleast not in the Catholic church. I understand what the Wiccans are saying, but don't take it too personally. Well now that I've put in my two cents I just have to say that this movie is awesome. It sparked my interests in learning about Wicca and other religions, even though it is not exactly correct."
4,"Fun high school movie, not much horror","Before the television show Charmed appeared you could watch The Craft. Not much difference between the two (I'm trying to think of why The Craft has an R rating), except that on Charmed the witches were mature enough to think about their powers in a more responsible manner. The young ladies in The Craft just do things because they want to without considering the repercussions, and that makes for an interesting story line. The Wicca parts may not be accurate, but it's fun watching Robin Tunney's character adapt to her powers while in new surroundings, and the ending doesn't disappoint."
3,"My soul opened up when I heard ""Do Something.""","I'm truly feelin' the jazzy soulful rhythms of Macy Gray's ""Do Something."" That song speaks to me and puts me in a positive frame of mind - it's like that song just exudes positivity - I love it!"
4,Macy Gray: Do Something,"Definatley feeling Macy like a cool summerbreeze. You can feel the ""Arrested Development"" in her lazy, hazy, Billie Holiday kind of blues. Listening to Macy you'd think she's definately sat ""Under a Cherry Moon"" at one point or another. You can hear the influence of funk vibes of artist like The Artist Formely Know as Prince. Gotta Love her raspy style and moody grooves, Millie would be proud. Definatley the perfect addition to a late night, dim light, incense burnin, layin back in the cut, with whoever, doin whatever kind of evening. A must have in your CD collection."
5,Awesome Recording!,"In the moment I heard the track ""Still"", I was hypnotized by it. It's a great song and it has substance to it. It makes you think and Macy Gray is a GREAT artist."
3,Great,"When I first heard the song, I also fell in love with it. Not to tight on the entire album, but I will def. search out the single. Peace"
2,"Great movie, bad matting!","First off, I REALLY love this movie. I wish I could do two raitings, one for the movie, and one for the disc, but I can't, so this is only about the disc.My biggest dislike is that this movie was not put to disc using the anamorphic widescreen technology. Instead, it was matted with the black letter box bars, essentially hard-letterboxing the picture. This wasn't of much concern to me when I originally purchased the movie, because I was watching it on an SD 4:3 TV. Now that I am using a 16:9 HD TV, what I get is letter box bars, AND pillar box bars, essentially reducing my 32in TV to a 22in TV.I am hoping for a blu-ray version to be released so that I can see this film in all it's intended glory.Don't get me wrong, pillar box bars have their place when viewing 4:3 content on a 16:9 screen, but when the picture is supposed to be 16:9 or better (2.35:1, etc...) then having both pillar box bars and letter box bars together just makes me feel cheated."
4,Action movie w/ character development,"This movie just showed on the FX channel so I watched it after seeing it for the first time since it was first released on cable. I had forgotten a lot of the plot but the characters are unique and maybe because a woman direct it, the Angela Basset character is very strong. Anything with AB is a plus. Fiennes can disappear into roles and I don't see any of his other characters in this performance. The plot itself is a bit thin, but it unfolds through a lot of character interaction. I prefer this type of scifi movie to one where theres just a lot of shooting and special FX (that's right SW, I'm talking to you)."
4,entering the new year,"i rented this video because it was at the video store. and then becoming a great ralph fiennes fan, bought the video. james cameron is always creative (not having watched the titanic) i can only appreciate the terminator series and this movie - strange days. the performances are believable. ralph fiennes does an outstanding job of someone who is addicted to his discs, and a woman he loves and yes life too. angela bassett brings more to her role as a woman who is not afraid to be tough and vulnerable. either way the movie was/is timely. it shows the decisive moments that we are faced with in this new year and for that i give it a thumbs up! maybe after the new year people will look at this cleverly drawn interpretation at LA on the edge with a laissez-fair attitude. I felt it was timely."
2,A waste of terrific actors,"As a longtime fan of the cult film ""Blade Runner,"" I had hoped this film would be in the same vein--and maybe it will, in time. But the convoluted plot is too much even for this great cast--Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Lewis, Angela Bassett, Tom Sizemore--hey, this should have been a great film. But the actors struggle bravely to not much avail. The one clip I enjoyed was Fiennes' and Bassett's sexy kiss at the end, but it was pretty unbelievable that two people who had just been almost beaten to death could have mustered up much erotic drive. Fiennes fans will enjoy seeing his usual brilliance, but don't expect another ""Blade Runner."" END"
2,You can find better sci-fi in Blade Runner & Dreamscape,This was a sub-par bit of sci fi that recycles the 'future is desolate' idea of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and the 'wouldn't it be interesting to explore the thoughts and experiences of someone else?' idea of Dreamscape. People in a gloomy almost Y2K LA jack into other people's lives. A couple of the life experiences available for public consumption turn out to be killings. The talented actors waste a lot of time flailing around trying to figure out among other thing who the killer is.The voyeuristic... murder mystery portion of the plot is an interesting idea but so it's cluttered with a bunch of cheap false leads and worse Ray Fiennes character mooning over Juliette Lewis as to kill the story idea. The actors do their best and the special effects are little more than good film editing. Mostly it's a way to [spend] two hours but you can definitely get better science fiction for your money.
2,"Not bad, but not that good","There definitely is an audience for this film, though many of them might secretly like to see a snuff film, too. Some of the edgier scenes in this one - and there are plenty - come uncomfortably close. Younger viewers weaned on ""Natural Born Killers,"" ""Pulp Fiction,"" and the like will get a kick out of this, but if that's not your thing, steer clear. Not worthless: Juliette Lewis is nude in several scenes. She does, however, sing."
2,Misogyny and lousy direction sink movie,"This film doesn't just pale in comparison to its cyberpunk cousins ""Bladerunner"" or ""12 Monkeys,"" it turns ghostly white and dies. The film misses the mark because it can't decide what it's aiming for, and so it resorts to tired old Hollywood formulas. For example, the film nominally decries misogyny while at the same time offering viewers voyeuristic scenes of women being murdered, raped, groped, and screwed. (And that's when they're not stripping and standing around 90-100% nude.) Bassett's strength gives the movie some female force, but only by putting her macho boots up the noses of the bad guys and gals. Interestingly, the film portends the LA police's CRASH unit--a murderous group of fascists which has come to public light since this film was made. But that real story of CRASH is far more horrifying than this weak drama."
3,3 stars but only for Rafe's hair.,"This movie is unwatchable but if you're into hotty Brit actor Rafe then by all means have a look. First of all, mix yourself either a Mojito or a martini...or several. Trust me, you'll need it. The key is to put the ""movie"" on mute and have the remote at the ready for every time Juliet Whatsherface, Angela Bassett or Tom Sizemore is on-screen. Simply FF. There's no reason to put yourself through that kind of torture. There's also no reason to put yourself through the torture of the clunky and embarrassingly cheesy dialogue. Katherine Bigelow should be ashamed and publicly humilated. Jesus Christ."
1,Boring with a bit of the old Ultraviolence,"I'd like to rate this negative 5, but 1 is the lowest Amazon offers.This movie seemed very pointless. Boring. It has almost no plot and goes nowhere. The characters are unlikely and poorly developed. I turned this movie off 3/4 through it. I can only say that about maybe 5 movies in my life.What finally made me turn this off was a very sick scene involving rape, torture, and murder. I've seen movies that are rated X that were cleaner. I'm no prude, but this was a disgusting movie.Save yourself some time and watch a porn video."
2,"Great Film, Problematic DVD","This is a great film, and perhaps Bigelow's best before she went on to win an Oscar for ""Hurt Locker."" Unfortunately, I see no indication that this isn't the same disc that I have, which is also stated to be 2.35:1 widescreen. On my widescreen TV this displays the way widescreen releases did on not-so-widescreen TVs back in the day: letterboxed, with black bars above and below. But the extra width of the TV means black bars on the sides as well. Letterboxing on widescreen TVs is really annoying. It would be nice if this was re-released in a manner that does it justice, perhaps as a part of a ""Bigelow Collection."""
5,GREAT TECHNO THRILLER!,"With technology advancing as fast as it is, and the millenium close at hand, this is a MUST SEE movie. If you are a Juilet Lewis or Angela Bassett fan, this is a MUST SEE Movie. If you like techno (The Matrix) type movies, this is a must see. YOU JUST MUST SEE IT!"
2,Great picture and sound - lousey movie,This was a huge let down as far as plots go. The movie dragged on and on. My friends and I almost fast forwarded to the last chapter to finally find out what happend in this painfully written sci-fi. My advise would be to rent it for the DVD aspects and keep the $ for a better title for the collection.
4,Intense thriller,"Suspensful, good acting, interesting premise, a little too violent to rate it 5 stars"
4,"Dark, Suspenseful and a whole lotta fun!","This movie proved the versatility of Angela Bassett and Ralph Fiennes as actors. They can go from seriously dramatic, or comical or hardcore unlike other actors who seem to play themselves in every film but still manage to get an Oscar! *pay attention Jack Nicholson* I had a great time watching this movie with it's quick pace and storyline. Although there was just one tiny lil'flaw. I loved Juliette Lewis in "" Natural Born Killers"" and ""The other Sister"" but she was seriously miscasted in this one. She looked out of place, and gave a totally inconvincing performance as a woman who would be enticing enough to cause Fiennes's character to obsess over her. Otherwise, Sizemore and Wincott made up for Juliette's mess of a role and I only wish that I can see more of Wincott and his creepy voice."
5,"Innovative, entertaining, informative","A new approach to financing public education that makes sense for the 21st century. Should be read by school board members and members of Congress and all others concerned about the future liabilites Americans will have to those who have retired. This book should start a new public discussion but is being ignored for lack of publicity. Easy to read economic analysis, sprinkled with humor and cartoons."
1,Mistakes Galore,"Sorry to burst anyone's bubble but Velikovsky's work regarding ancient Egypt is not scientific & full of errors.Anyone interested in egyptology or history of Ancient Egypt mustnt depend on Velikovsky;s work as he fantasizes alot & mixes myth with what he wants to be fact, not to mention lying through his teeth about several papyruses allegedly speaking of the exodus, while ommiting a few words that bring down his theory to the ground only to make things go his way. The guy seriously lied & is no way an authority in the field he wrote."
4,Excellent historical comparison of Bible with other sources,"In this book Mr Velikovsky compared the Bible's historical events with those evidenced in particularly Egyptian sources but also other Middle East sources. The author seemed to do an excellent and exhaustive job of finding parallels that, according to his conclusions, showed that the contemporary historical time charts were out of kilter by about 600 years. It takes some serious powers of concentration to get thru this book and keep up with all of the names and comparisons used by the author (this is not light reading)."
5,An excellent piece of research!,A must read archive of information for anyone interested in ancient Middle-Eastern history. Velikovsky succeeds in correlating historical writings from several different cultures to resolve many of the problems related to dating events in ancient Egypt.
4,without getting too excited,this product was exactly what I needed. It arrived ahead of schedule and in excellent working order. I would not hesitate to purchase from this seller again if the price was right.
5,Love it,I love this little fan. I just started using it tonight and I'm already pleased with it. I ordered it to keep mine and my wifes laptops cool as we play games and already the heat's not coming up through the keys anymore. The 2 speed is about the same noise level as the fan on your laptop running. The 1 speed is near silent.
4,Air king clip on fan,Fan works well. Would prefer it was all plastic because I use it in a small bathroom. Could be more powerful but it is adequate. Amazon handled the shipping very professionally
5,Quiet and convenient,"My sons have a bunk bed, and the top one gets really warm since it's so high. We bought this and it clipped right on the side rail, keeping things nice and cool and without being obnoxiously loud."
4,"quiet, solid, but wish it moved a little more air","The title of my review says it all. I believe the fan is a good value.I dont't really see why there are 2 speeds, they seem about the same to me."
3,OK fan for the price.,"The wattage specs are truthful: 9W on low, 12W on high (confirmed with a Kill-A-Watt). Other specs I'm not too sure about: CFM of 190 on high seems a bit optimistic (I can feel a very slight breeze at 3 feet), and the 37 dBA noise level probably doesn't include the annoying grinding/vibrating sound the motor on mine has (on either speed).The design doesn't seem very efficient. They could have used a bigger fan in the enclosure, and the big ""Air King"" circular plastic center piece is larger than the fan hub, so it's impeding some of the airflow.Regardless, I got it just to clip on to my desk to give some HDD docks some cross-breeze when in use, so it satisfies the requirements."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY-MINE CAUGHT FIRE!!!,"Within the first 5 minutes of turning it on the think caught fire. I bought it to use in my bunk in Afghanistan, but luckily i decided to test it out first. I clipped to my desk and I smelled a strong electical buring smell as soon as I turned it on. The a 'pop' and a puff of smoke and a small flame. I yanked it off the desk and threw it outside in the dust before it set off the smoke alarms. Total POS and a waste of money!!! I hope Amazon will give me a refund."
4,Works like a champ,"(+) This product has lasted over 4 years of off and on use. It is still very quiet which was one of requirements for me cuz I use it in the office. It so quiet, I have forgotten to switch off and let it run over a the whole weekend a few times.(-) I wish the clip was a bit larger. My table is over two inches thick so I have re-seat every couple of months or so. Despite falling off a few times from my standing desk it still work fine though."
2,"Fan tick, tick, ticks","I'm searching for a fan to use in my bedroom as white noise at night, but this fan started ticking pretty loudly about 10 minutes after I plugged it in. Still searching..."
4,Great fan - but not what was advertised,"This fan is awesome, perfectly suited for my small area, however it isnt what was advertised. I ordered a clip on fan - like what is shown, and received one with a standard fan base. Not worth the effort to return, so I will settle. Fan works well, and is quiet - just wish it would have been clip on as advertised."
2,WEAK!,"I don't know who are writing these reviews! Yeah, the fan is durable. Yeah, it clamps on well. However, unless your face is 2 inches from it, you can't feel a thing!!"
4,"Good, but could be a little better","I ordered this fan to help with some of the airflow in my room while deployed to Afghanistan. I clip it to the end of my bed and it seems to do what it's advertised to do. The power cord is plenty long enough and seems to be well built, rather than some of the cheaper ones I've run into. The clip is sturdy and the fan stays in it's position thanks to a little screw that allows you to tilt it up and down to your liking. My only complaint about this fan is the amount of airflow. As I mentioned earlier, I have this clipped to the end of my bed. On the highest speed, I can barely feel a faint breeze on me. At the end of the day, I'd recommend this fan for someone looking for a little bit of a breeze at a close distance."
3,Of course it's quiet,This fan is quiet because it doesn't blow a lot of air. The fan I had that this was is replacing was the same size but blew about three times as much air. Definitely over-priced for a fan lacking in power.
3,clamp is kind of cheap,"The clamp is of poor design and quality compared to other brands I have owned. I am hoping the quality and lifespan of the motor is better, because that is always the weak link of these little fans."
4,Average fan,Good fan. Not quite as powerful as I'd like but it's super quite. I purchased for sons top bunk and he has to place it right by his face. The quality of the fan looks good just wish it was a little more powerful.
3,clip on fan,I use the fan to blow air into the cockpit of my airplane in the hot summer months while I am fixing various items. The cockpit is extremely hot without the fan but fairly nice with the fan on.
3,clamp issue,"I purchased a couple of these at my local hydroponics shop and I'm currently using them in a DR120 (dark room 3x3x7).I was expecting the clamps to be stronger (main reason I'm sure most people buy these.). So far I've had both units drop to the floor ... what would happen if I was away on a trip I'd be really pissed off to find them laying on the floor, wasting energy not doing their job, and there's also the possibility of them falling and harming other equipment//plants.I would have given these 4/5 if not for the clamps ... they pretty good fans for an inexpensive 6"", they're super quiet, and use very little power.I'm thinking I might have to tie them up, hang them, tape them, etc etc ... which kind of defeats the purpose... also I'm thinking of clamping them from the top poles instead of the sides of my DR120 ... but the CFM might not be strong enough."
1,Air King 6-Inch Fan,"This is a fan? I stood right in front of it and didn't feel any air movement.Not worth the money.Get a Holmes Fan, they have the right blade setup to get air to move."
5,Great cook book,"Thisis one of the best, common sense nutrition books I have read in awhile. It is written by 2 authors. One is a vegetarian. Personally I do not feel being a vegetarian is the most healthy choice but that does not negate all the fabulous information on eating and cooking in the book. Personally I just ignore any pro vegetarian propaganda in that half of the book. Both authors know their food well."
3,Not as much history,"It was a cute book but didn't contain as much historical facts as I would have thought. It is a counting book, that holds true. Each page alternates between 1 pilgrim ....., 2 Indians, and so on up to 12. There are some vocabulary words that my kiddo would have been last on had I not been able to fill in the blanks- the book doesn't do that. However the pictures are beautiful and kept her asking questions."
4,Clever integration of Pilgrims and Native Americans,"This book provides a nice addition to the library of Thanksgiving stories. It alternates typical day to day activities of Pilgrim and Native American children to give children perspective of life at that time on a Thanksgiving unit. The language is rich and the pictures are lovely. I used it with my beginning ESL adult class and some of the language was too high for them, but American speaking children would not have trouble with it. Lovely pictures."
3,Not so great - but a suggested solution,"I bought this because I needed to scan a few dozen very old negatives of varying sizes. I couldn't find much in this price range, and none of the other models seemed to stand out. That being said, I pretty much agree with the criticisms that other reviewers remarked on: It's very slow, software is not very good and is confusing, and it doesn't look like a lot of engineering thought went into it.After being frustrated, I bought a third party software package that is used for scanners ([...]) and found out that most of the problem with speed must reside in the HP software. The Vuescan software package speeds up the whole process by a factor of 3 or 4, and is easy to use to boot. So, my recommendation is either to return for something better, if you can find something, or try this software (for another $40.00) or something similar."
1,Disappointment,"I spent the best part of a day trying to install the scanner, without success. After the second call to HP Tech Support, it was declared defective and to be returned. I accepted a second G4050 scanner. Spent another day with phone calls and no success. I would then spend two consecutive hours on the phone to HP Tech Support, with no success. Later that day a repeat with a different technician for another two hours. I returned the device with regret, because I liked the ability to scan sixteen 35mm slides-if it works."
1,Not Vista compatable,I purchased the G4950 from Amazon at the recomendation of HP since HP no longer supports their other scanners in XP. This scanner will not work with Vista. I have been on the phone and online with Hp 4 times in one week and the scanner will not work properly. I am sending it back to Amazon. BEWARE OF VISTA AND HP.
2,Poor service,"The scanner arrived and appears to be of good quality, but shipped without the template needed to scan slides. Since my company bought this machine solely to scan our slide collection, this renders the scanner useless to us. Contacting the seller proved fruitless, as their policy is that if you do not notice missing or damaged items within two days of arrival, they will not solve the problem. I will never buy from this seller again, and I urge you to do likewise. There are better sellers out there that deserve our business.Update! I contacted HP customer service about the issue, and they are sending the part, since the machine is well under warranty. Thanks HP!"
1,Awful scanner,"This is an awful choice for scanning slides. I am a professor and this device was bought for me by my department so I didn't have a choice. My main intention was to scan lots of slides. The scanner simply does not focus. All of its scans are blurry and bad quality. When we complained, the HP reps did some testing on them and somehow convinced our computer support person that there is nothing wrong with it. I do not recommend anyone to purchase this item. Its support service is also evil."
1,As slow as it gets,"I ordered this scanner with high expectations generated by the good specifications and the quality brand name of HP. The device itself is sturdy and well manufactured as one would expect. However, I was more than disappointed by the extremely slow performance. It is nearly impossible to scan slides with higher resolution than 1200 bpi. The data amount prodcued and hours spent on scanning only one slide are risicolous. In addition, the software is completely counter-intuitive and buggy, overriding settings and behaving in an inconsistent manner.Conclusion: Sent the scanner back to the internet shop."
2,Garbo!,"I am so sick of HP products. I told myself NO I would never buy one again, but they had to have this thing on sale and I suckered myself into buying one. Was not happy at all. Driver issues, speed issues, and it kept freezing my brand new computer. I thought, wow guys, its no wonder you shut down your computer department. This company sucks!"
1,terrible software & support,"I used this on slides with tolerable quality results, but when I had to reinstall the software on XP, the nightmare began. After many uninstalls, reinstalls, registry cleanups, internet searches on why the endless loop of ""Please wait while windows configures scan"", no help from HP, I'm ready to pitch this HP scanjet G4050. Terrible software and clueless support."
3,HP Scanner program the worst.,I have bought TWO of these scanners. On both occasions (at home and at work) the HP scanning program that came with the scanner failed to work. I got the scanners to work only after using an outside scanning program. The scanners are great once you get them going. The HP site was no help at all though.
1,Poor HP Support,"Upon receipt of this HP Scanjet G4050 I tried to install. I have Windows XP professional, and it would not install. Contacted HP Support and began what turned out to be many hours of e-mails and instant messages with HP Support agents some place in the World. I did everything they told me to do, without any success.I was told to do certain things that required shutting down the computer which caused me to lose my instant message conact at HP, and then I had to start over with another agent who really didn't know how to resolve my problem. I have one computer, and their final solution was for me to install on another computer. I suggested they send me known good CD, but no comment from HP. I asked how to contact HP Support management, and that too was not answered. So, I am returning the G4050, and no doubt will not buy any HP products in the future."
1,HP Disappointment,"Color of scans was too saturated and unrealistic when compared with comparable scans and original slides. Software is quite user unfriendly. Scan speed unacceptably slow for adequate resolution of medium format positives. Did not live up to specifications and fell far short of expectations, so it was returned immediately. I am very disappointed in this product and it does not seem to live up to usual HP standards."
5,Great slide scanner,"After reading all of the reviews I was a bit worried about the ease of scanning slides with this unit. I am totally happy with it! I have easily scanned 100+ slides in a very short period of time. The template that holds the slides in place sits directly on the scanner's glass. Then you just lay the slides in it- very easy! I have the default setting at a very low resolution to get many slides scanned quickly- I can't believe how true to color and clarity I'm getting!! It takes about 5 minutes to scan 16 slides, cataloging is very easy with the software.So, go get this scanner and bring back to life the great old slide photos hidden away in your boxes!"
1,Slow,Slow as molasses and reverts back to its default no matter what I selected. As annoying as can be. Don't waste your money. Put it towards something speedier and more intuitive.
4,HP Scanjet G4050,"I have had almost every brand of scanners over the past 20 years. Most are in a pile in the basement. What I found over time, is that the various manufactures quit supporting the particular models so that when new operating systems come out, drivers are not available. This is not the case with HP.I do quite a bit of photo restoration and my Scanjet 4670 started to give me stripes on the photos (mostly sepia). I really liked the vertical see through scanner but had to have one in a hurry to finish a job. I ordered the G4050. The delivery time was excellent (via UPS not USPS). I was able to track the package to my door with no problems.The unit installed with no problems (Vista 64 bit) and was running in minutes. The first picture came out perfect. I was back in business.I would have given this unit 5 stars instead of 4 but I am spoiled by the small footprint of the 4670 against the flat large footprint of the G4050.The bottom line is this is a lot of scanner for the money."
1,WARNING!,"This scanner is NOT compatible with the current Macintosh operating system - OS 10.6.HP insisted a new driver would be available in October, but nothing has been released as of 20 November."
1,HP G4050 Scanner,All efforts to get this scanner to operate in either Windows 7 64 bit or Linux are a waste of time. I cannot understand why HP would ignore giving support for this expensive product.
1,Poor Quality Control at HP,This product has issues and least of which is being able to work. I purchased a new unit but received a used unit. The install CD had a large scatch on it and I was not able to load the software. Amazon shipped a second unit which took me some time to install but at least it was a new unit. After spending 3 hours on the phone with HP help desk it was determined that the unit was broken. I would recommend another scanner before buying this unit.
1,Poor performance on slides,"If you need to scan photos or documents this is an alright scanner but there are others less expensive that do that well. The idea of being able to batch scan 16 slides is the reason I bought this scanner, unfortunately it does a very poor job even one at a time. The results were grainy, banded, and lacked detail depending on the settings I used. I tried technical support but received very poor support on HP chat, the rep even forgot what we were talking about and started asking about the documents I was scanning.So if you are looking for a decent slide scanner this is not one to even try unless you just want to make small prints (fair 4 x 6 or less prints could be done with some Photoshop work on them)."
1,Trouble with my first scanner,"I'm in Europe now with my Scanjet G4050/CN186AB0ZP. It has worked only in elementary fashion. It does not do OCR, it does not look up program updates. Its CD L1956-10025 ""for Mac"" says ""you cannot open the HP Scanjet install.app because PowerPC apps are no longer supported."" Each attempt of contact to HP leads into nowhere, ""We are unable to locate the e-mail hp for product support."" The website hp.com.at has disappeared."
1,Access is Denied,"Get used to seeing that message if you waste your money on this scanner. Just ended an hour long phone call with HP customer support trying to install the software on windows XP. They know about the problem. The installation package includes the ""Access Denied Utility"" which was ineffective on my system.They are researching the problem and promise to call call later. In the mean time I have an attractive $250 paper weight on my desk"
2,HP Scanjet G4050 scanner,"The product arrived with a power cord that didn't fit. The product was advertised as being able to scan multiple slides/negatives, but the needed templates were not included. The software was also not included. I spoke with the seller and was very pleased with their quick response. They were extremely nice and told me to return the product for a full refund. I would have been willing to keep it if I could have obtained some templates for the slide/negative scans, but was unable to locate any.While it was very inconvenient for me I was very pleased with the seller's response to the problem and would shop with that seller again."
4,My scanjet G4050 review.,"This machine serves me very well. I only have one problem with it. The image on-screen is not very well defined or I am not doing something right. Overall, it's fantastic. Worked fine, right out of the box.If anyone out there knows how to fine tune the image on-screen, how about shooting me a line or two, and share your knowledge with me about my issue. Dr. Love"
1,Great Paper Weight,This Scanner is a pile of #%$@!. It's as slow as molasses and the quality of the scans are like a $20 digital camera. It is definitely NOT for professionals or for those who value great images.
1,Difficult Product - Stay away from HP in general,"I've owned several HP products, i.e., 2 printers and this scanner. They are uniformly difficult to use, with very bad software. I've needed to reinstall the scanjet software over a dozen times. Every time I use the scanner, it is a different nightmare (software components missing that need to be reinstalled, interactions with other software, the scanner doesn't respond). My HP printers are also garbage. I would never buy anything from HP again. They make junk."
1,"Not designed for 16 slides, poor sensitivity","We had an older version of this scanner that scanned 25,000 slides before it finally wore out. We purchased this new version. The new unit appeared to have a CCD with poor sensitivity, plus a light leak. Could barely scan 4 slides when specs said it would scan 16 like the older version. Sent unit back as faulty, but ordered another. The next unit had no light leaks, but still poor sensitiviy. Still would only do three or four slides even with updated software. HP tech support claimed that was just the way it worked, and nothing much they could do. Returned this unit, and are sending our slides to Costco to make DVDs.Scanjet G4050 High-Speed USB Photo Scanner, 4800 x 9600dpi"
5,scan,"WORKS GREAT. I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS. DOES EVERYTHING I WONTED IT TO. COULD NOT BE HAPPIER.SCANS SLIDES, NEGITIVES AND PRINTS."
3,Bulky but very nice quality.,Bought it for my mother for Christmas. She said it was easy enough to set up but it does take up alot of space. Her passion is geneology and she shares pitures with family members via internet. She had some negatives of her mother who passed away before I was born. She had some of them restored years ago at photo store but we live in a very rural area and this just works better for us. It really is the best thing I have ever bought her.
3,Problen]ms if you have both HP-G4050- and Photosmart D7360,"I bought this form Amazon, it was defective, and Amzon was fast in shipping a repalcement. My problems started when I installed the HP supplied software version 8.2 for Windows Media XP on the HP computer. The installed scanner would not work. Had four days of back and forth e-mails with HP help center.Did every thing they suggested, none worked. At last HP help center suggested going to HP website and downloading a new version of software (9). Was confused because similar version 9 for Microsoft Vista. I was told it is new software for XP Media Edition and once this software was installed it works. Still lot of bugs, for example can not remove the old version (8.2) from the computer, and often the system stops responding. HP needs to improve their software and software patches.I normally do not post any comments, but if you have HP Photsmart Printer, beware of the software incompatiblity between HP G4050 and Photsamart D7360."
2,"Solid scanner, fuzzy focus on slides & negatives","I've owned this scanner for almost a year and find it to produce good crisp images when scanning photos, but slightly fuzzy images with scanning slides or negatives, regardless of the DPI setting. Color rendition is excellent. I'm likely to upgrade to the Cannon 8800F since my main reason for getting this unit was to scan 1000+ slides and I'm not happy with the quality of the slide scans when compared to other options that I've tried. The best scans I've seen come from a Nikon film scanner, but, unfortunately it does not work under vista, takes only one slide at a time and takes over 5 minutes per scan."
2,Mac Users avoid: Not Snow Leopard friendly,"The slide portion doesn't work for Mac Users, even after recent driver updates, it is a known issue on their forums. I was really hoping to use this for slides and that feature doesn't work at all on the Mac OS. TMA adapters could be better fitting and explained (manual is weak). The pictures have been fine in scan quality. A tip sheet would have been nice too, because some of it's features (Enhance Colors) over do it on recent color photos, but it worked fine for faded or old color photos. HP Support is non-existent, M-F 9-5 during the week only , without response to emails is unacceptable."
1,HP Scanjet,"I have just gone through one of the worst experiences with a product company ever, and that's saying a lot. After several months of trying to get the ScanJet to work with Vista the service rep announced .. ""sorry you are out of warranty!"" I reminded her that the manual said one year from date of purchase and that HP could repair or replace with comparable product and she said she would get back to me. Guess what HP has not responded since. The box the scanner came with clearly stated Vista compliant so I am of the opinion that their product is not only defective but that HP is utilizing deceptive advertising. Such a sad development for what I have always held as a quality company."
1,Junk From The Get Go,"This scanner threw a lamp error right out the box. After a little coaxing, I managed to get it to make a single 600 dpi scan that lasted about 4 minutes, possibly longer. I loaded the next photos and it threw the error again and continued doing so until I jammed it back into the box for it's ride back to the store. Of course, included is the CD full of useless HP software that gets installed when you install the scan application. Who knows what you need and don't need? HP sucks and the only reason I bought it was because the store was out of the Canon scanner that I was looking for when I walked in. Look into the Epson or Canon line of scanners."
3,"Nice, good quality, but slow","Nice scanner, good quality, but slow. It is average speed for documents and photos, but it takes several minutes to scan negatives and if you just let it work on automatic it does not scan the entire image. The scans are high quality and it is easy to use. You just have to sit with it and make adjustments on every scan."
2,Would recommend this product,"HP Scanjet G4050 Photo Scanner (L1957A#B1H)Up and running in 20 minutes on a Vista computer.I am completely satisfied with tho photo scans that I have made so far and have recommended this to some friends who are looking for a scanner to scan old pictures.EDIT 01/2011: HP has yet to come out with windows 7 support. Now that all of my computers are running win7, I own a brick."
3,Super slow install,I have installed hundreds of products to a computer. But 45 minutes to install software for a scanner is a little ridiculous. The scanner is also on the noisy side. Some of the features it offers is pretty nice. Not a bad scanner but plan a lot of time for an install.
4,Purchased elsewhere after damaged shipment,"Unfortunately the HP 4050 purchased through Amazon was damaged in shipment. Processing of refund was smooth, but slow because of UPS intermediate process. Rather than try another shipment I went to a local source and found that they had the 4050 on closeout. So I got it for $50 less than it would have been through the Amazon source.The scanner itself seems to work as advertised. Instructions and manuals are very sketchy, but I have been able to muddle through. Sometimes cold restarts are required if false starts or changes are made during process. Processing of 16 slides at a time is slow, especially if multiple processes such as cleanup and color correction are requested. But the time it takes to catalog and add metadata for the images is similar to the processing time, so can go on concurrently for the previous set and no time is 'lost'.I didn't need the HP photo storage and organizing software automatically provided."
2,"Slow, kept giving errors, big/heavy",The main problem with this scanner was the fact that I was trying to scan old slides with it. However after about five minutes of scanning it would throw an error and tell me to restart the computer. The software included is not so great. The scanner itself is very slow and it wouldn't let me scan at full resolution because of a 2gb size limit. Bottom line...it's being returned.
5,HP Scanjet G-4050,"I read many reviews about this scanner before I purchased it. Many were negative and a few very positive. My review would be in the very positive. Yes, it is slow to warm up, but once warmed up it scans faster than any I have used or viewed in the process of scanning, in this price range and some even way above this price range. I have scanned about 3000 pictures with this unit to date and all have been perfect. The edit software leaves a lot to be desired. I can't imagine why HP don't update the older software ""Photosmart Premier"". That was a good software, but won't work with Windows 7. I scan into a scan file and then import the scans into Photoshop Essentials for all my editing needs. The scanner is great though."
1,HP Scanner Problems,"I received the scanner in a timely manner, in good condition. The software was easy to use and hookup instructions simple and clear. Unfortunately, the scanner would not work. After following the ""problem"" guidelines, I finally called in a professional computer tech. After three hours, we gave up and the scanner was returned. The company was very helpful with the return. No idea why it didn't work."
1,Not User Friendly,The scanner was bought new from HP and is not user friendly. The directions tell you to take off a part of the scanner in order to scan slides - You take that part off and the scanner keeps telling you it is still on the scanner.You scan photos and have to keep rescanning since it decides what part of a picture to scan - I have tried to scan a photo but it picks only certain part of the photo to scan.I have had to keep rescanning some pics since the scanner does NOT use the entire bed of the scanner. It only uses a portion.If I could give the review a negative number I would - Now I am trying to get the box back together in order to return the scanner to HP.
1,D.O.A. -returning ASAP.,"It scanned documents fine, but when scanning film, it made a mechanical clicking noise like it was grinding some plastic gears. It did this just after the preview scan, and also during the actual scan, a few times per scan.I chatted with an HP support guy who walked me through some diagnostics and a test of the lid, and we confirmed it had an issue.I'm using Windows XP."
4,Good Scanner,"I bought this product to preserve old family photos and keep records of our negatives. The scanner is good for this if you're on a budget.Many reviews I read had trouble with the HP software associated with this scanner. I did not have any trouble installing anything. Scanning pictures/photos is easy and software is easy to use. The photo program it comes with is limited (if you're comparing it to Photoshop), but for someone who doesn't want to learn Photoshop, it's great.*scans glossy photos better than matte photos*scanning negatives is trickier (more settings) and you really need to make sure your negatives have no dust on it*negative slide tray was a little difficult to useValue: 4 StarsSize and Style: 3.5 Stars (it looks great but it's bulky)Scan Time: 4 StarsScan Quality: 4 Stars (great quality without paying a high price)Included Photo-Editing Software: 4 Stars"
5,"Great scanner, great support","I purchased this scanner for the purpose of digitizing our family collection of slides, photographs and other important documents that I want to save electronically. The setup was easy and the instructions were clear.I encountered difficulty making the connection between the scanner and my computer. So after trying all of the suggested troubleshooting steps, I called the HP support line received excellent patient assistance which has resulted in wonderful scanning experiences.I would make the same purchase all over again."
2,"Ok for scanning prints, terrible for slides","I bought this scanner to scan slides. The 16 slide tray was great, but that is the only good thing I have to say about this scanner. The software is terrible, hard to use, doesn't remember settings, with some settings reverting back to default settings even while running. Scans of anything even slightly dark result in very visible noise. If you have the dust removal feature turned on, the noise gives it fits. Scanning bright colorful slides, or bright prints seems to work ok, but there's a lot cheaper printers that can do that."
3,OK with some problems,"On the plus side, the scans have excellent color reproduction and the images are sharp and crisp. On the negative side, at 200 dpi it tends to pick out every little flaw in photos; matte-finish photos have a large amount of ""noise"". Worst of all, my unit arrived with a foggy film on the underside of the scanner glass. HP has directions for cleaning the underside of the glass on their website and it was just a matter of wiping it down with a microfiber cloth, but one shouldn't have to take it apart and put it back together after just taking it out of the box for the first time."
1,G4050 Flatbed Scanner,I really can't say anything about this scanner as I couldn't get the software installed on my HP Vectra running Windows 2000 Professional with 2gb memory.I tried HP's help but still couldn't get it installed so I returned the product.
1,Cheap cheap cheap!,"Very disappointed. Cheap quality. I wanted to send it back, but waited too long for a return. Glad I only paid $6 for it. I have since thrown it out."
3,"Worth reading, but a bit dry","I enjoyed the book but not as much as I had hoped. It is filled with so many superflous details, that at times I was lost waiting for the author to reach his point of deliever the information I was looking for. If someone is looking for an indepth book on the history and geography of Israel and the surrounding region, then this is a great read. However, if basic information concerning the geography of Isreal (especially during the first century) is what you are after, then pass on this one."
1,Lacks depth and interest,"I didn't enjoy this book. It lacks any kind of insight or depth into the main character's thoughts and emotions; none of it rings true. She is hopping around, half way engaging in activities, focusing on trite musings, and ultimately little is gained. The author spreads the story out over several improbable topics and by the time she gets to the convenient spiritual hallucinations, it's lame. The writing is unengaging. Skip it."
2,Its not all that good.,I bought this item and hearing is great but the people can't hear me on the other end. I wouldnt recommend this.
1,Jabra C250 EarWave Boom Headset,"Absolutely, utterly, phenomenally, completely useless! This is a slightly different design than the Jabra that I have used for years and, being the same brand of device and just a slightly different looking design, I thought that it would be comparable....NOT!!! All I get from the people I am trying to talk to is, ""What?"" and ""Where are you? What's all that noise?"" ""What?!"" I highly recommend AGAINST anyone buying this piece of junk and I think that Jabra should be ashamed of themselves for selling it!"
3,Not sure about these yet,"I bought these for my cell phone. Of course, they did not fit, so I bought the adapter that I am still waiting to arrive. The fit is a little unusual but I think it will work. For the price, it was too good to not give them a try."
1,Better to spend a little more and get a good one,"The earpiece does not fit properly on mt ears and ehrnever I talk, people on other side complain that I am not audible.finally decided to buy another one."
2,Uncomfortable and bad sound,"All my bluetooth headsets were not performing well. Several cell phone reps suggested a corded headset. This one seemed to get get good reviews, but truly, it was uncomfortable and the sound quality was poor at best. I would pass on this and try something else."
2,doesn't work as expected...,"this headset doesn't work on my Samsung M240 Sprint cell phone even though it fit. There is no output sound in the ear piece, so you can't hear the caller, however mic sound worked fine - other side can hear you, but you can't hear other side! It either could be incompatible or defected."
1,Quick shipping - product does not work as described,"Ordered this for a Nokia phone, unfortunately it does not work with said phone, even though the description said it was for Nokia. Oh well."
1,DIssatisfied!!,The order came incomplete. HiTechCloseouts promised to send out the items but nothing has arrived. Amazon will not intervene yet they promote these vendors!!!
1,Not at all what I expected,"A leading consumer magazine recently awarded the JABRA EarWave boom headset its highest recommendation. I cannot imagine why. To hear with it at all, I must hold the ""ear gel"" speaker in my ear canal with my thumb. The microphone ends up over three inches from my mouth, and people on the other end cannot hear me. I'm going back to my one-size-fits-all cheapie from the discount store. Color me very disappointed."
1,Too smal,"This item is horrible, I couldn't fit it on my head, a headset it supposed to do that. Also, the mouth piece and the ear piece are so close together I couldn't even put the ear bit in my ear. Overall, this item is a piece of crap. I demand a refund"
2,Kinda Crappy,"Plug this in. Sometimes it connects; sometimes it doesn't.I hear callers just fine, but they ask if I am in the bathroom when I wear this.If I leave it plugged into the earphone jack of my phone, it somehow manages to turn my phone off after a few minutes of non-use.I would send it back, but my total cost was only $3.My phone is an older Motorola v365, and I'm sticking with to my BluetoothPlantronics 510 [Retail Packaging]. Maybe this can be an emergency backup."
3,It Will Break,"It has great sound quality. The sound is clear and precise.It fits perfectly around the ear. It comes with several different sizes of earpieces so you are sure to get a perfect fit - and the earpieces are soft and comfortable.The microphone section is placed perfectly. The length of the 'stem' is neatly placed and shaped so that the person on the other end hears clearly.I loved this headset BUT (and this is where it drops two stars in my opinion):It has 3 little holes on the curved section that goes above the ear. Those are weak points. It will break at one of these holes GUARANTEE - the hole closest to the earpiece. That's definitely a design flaw and it renders what would otherwise be one of the best boom headsets, useless."
1,Junk,"This didn't work very well at all, poor audio quality, not worth the few dollars it costs. I did't even bother returning it, which is a shame, because electronic junk is a real bane."
1,Low quality...you get what you pay for,"I found this ear piece to be very uncomfortable and the sound quality poor. I was hoping to find a version like a pricier Panasonic headset. The photo looks similar, but there is no comparison. I guess you really do get what you pay for. I tried this for a week, and now it never gets used."
2,Can you hear me? I hear you!,"This product needs to be shipped in better packaging so that it does not suffer damage in shipping. That being said, the one I received did not allow me talk to people, yet I could hear them. The Microphone was defective. The seller refunded my money.I would recommend this seller and would purchase from again."
1,This mic doesen't work,"So I ordered 2 of these for $6.50 and I thought they would be ok mics. Nooo. These mics broke as soon as they left the package. I could here out of them perfectly but the mic part was not working for both of them. If you plan on ordering this mic because it's cheap, don't be fooled. Order something else."
2,Not good,"The ear piece seemed to work pretty well, but the voice quality from the microphone was quite poor, unclear and seemed to almost echo."
1,Talking in a Tunnel,Buy or get a freebee$5 headset and it would be 10 times better. I sounded like I was in a deep tunnel when I finally heard my vm greeting! Not to mention the complaints I received from the receiving parties. Boom makes no sense; ends at my cheek and doesn't feel secure at all in ear. Why they released this with obvious quality issues is a mystery. Tried it with both cell and cordless. same same
1,Did not work upon receipt of item,"Like so many items of this type, it has a low quality. The microphone worked, but the earphone part did not work at all."
3,Not bad,The EarWave works great and does what it should. The problem I have and the reason why I gave it such a low score is because they usually do not last longer than three to six months. I use it in place of my bluetooth device and usually have to buy a new every few months. The wires begin to short out usually within the first six months.
1,Did not work,"I purchased the C250 along with a Samsung BlueTooth for my wife. Unfortunately, I shouldn't have been so cheap--the Bluetooth (also from Amazon) was only about $20, and the Jabra was a only a few dollars. I figured I would leave the cheap unit that doesn't need to be recharged in my car. The Jabra never worked with any of the cell phones in my family. A little quality-control could have ensured that customers receive a functioning product. I am not sure if the Jabra I purchased was new, used, or returned since it arrived in a plain, unmarked, unsealed plastic baggie with no documentation."
1,Buyer beware.,"I purchased two of these. When I received them, one did not work at all, so I returned it immediately. The other one ""appeared"" to work, however, I've used this product less than a month and I am getting complaints that my voice breaks up and sounds muffled when I'm using this headset. I don't recommend this product due to the poor quality and dependability of this item."
5,Great Headset!,"In CA a new hands free law is going into effect. Between myself, my wife, our three kids, and a vanpool we needed to find a good inexpensive headset to keep in our cars. The Jabra C250 really fits the bill. We have used them on a Motorola, Samsung, 2 different LGs and 2 different Sanyos without a problem.I would rate the sound quality as excellent and the microphone quality as good. You do have to talk clearly and with a little volume, but overall everyone can hear and understand, at least clarity-wise, what we are saying.The headsets are comfortable and although they feel a little loose, we have not had a problem with any of them falling off. Overall an excellent product.The best part is for $11 a piece, including shipping and a small camera case, everyone has a quality headset in his or her car that never needs charging so it is always ready to go.Great headset!John"
1,Nobody could hear me,"So, the headset fit pretty comfortably and the sound was great. The only problem was everytime I used it nobody on the other end could hear me! I ended up returning it for a body glove headset that works great."
5,hate the blue tooth,"I usually just dont answer the phone when driving and I hate staying on long calls, so the blue tooth headsets are always no charge. I prefer the corded headsets. I havent had any problems with this piece."
2,phone headset,"This was uncomfortable to wear and hard to hear, but is suitable if you have no other device to talk on your portable phone and aren't in a noisy area."
1,Defective crap,"I bought the Jabara C250 EarWave Boom Headset 2.5mm from Happy Cellular. This was my first time buying from Happy Cellular and my last. I didnt buy this product blindly off Amazon / Happy Cellular. I did my research at a local Verizon store for my specific phone and merely looked up retailers that offered the same. After a 2 week wait, it arrived. I plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked. I brought it into my local store and was told I picked the right model but it was essentially defective. Upon filing a claim, Happy Cellular did live up to one aspect of happiness: they provided customer service and a refund at my request."
2,"When it works, its great. WHEN , or if you can get it to work.","I gave up and threw mine away when it would not work correctly on any device. Ear phones on one, Mic on another. Poor Quality. I expected better from Jabra!"
5,Works Good!,"A bit flimsy, but; I've had no problems with this product. The price was good also, plus shipped free. Works for me. Thank You."
1,ALready broke,This product is horrible I have had it for about a week and it is already not working properly. I am going to send it back if I can find the paperwork.
1,not so loud,"sound is too low volume. I've used 2 or 3 different earpieces on the same phone and this one is the worst. Directional little rubber dealy doesn't help and seems to direct sound into the skin on my ear rather than toward the ear drum itself.Maybe it will fit someone else's ear better.I still use it, when I can't find any other one."
5,Headset for cell phone,I am very pleased with this product. Its light and fits in my ear perfectly. It comes with four different ear buds that will help you find the best one suited to your ear. I use it in the car on my cell phone with the windows down and my friends never complain about not being able to hear me. The mike itself is not very close to your mouth but picks up everything loud and clear. I use it as much as i can. A great wired hands free head set.
4,Decent,"Tried many different bluetooth devices, finally gave up......Great quality hearing and speaking....earpiece alittle uncomfortable is my only complaint....they have different size earbuds that come with it but still can't get a perfect fit....but overall recommend."
1,Poor Microphone Quality,"This model, the C250 EarWave Boom, is one of 4 Jabra headsets I have ordered. I continued to try different Jabra models because the ear piece is by far the most comfortable and best sound quality I have ever used, however, all 4 Jabras had very poor microphone quality. With each one, the persons on the other end could not hear me. Disappointed. I ended up getting the Ge Tl26593 Earset Microphone by Jasco, which has been the best so far."
2,"Ordered 3, only 2 worked","I ordered three Jabra C250 EarWave Boom Headsets for 2.5mm Plugs. One for the house and two for each of my cars. However, only 2 out of 3 worked when I first tried them. It was too much of a bother to return the one that didn't work. Now I use the other two. They are ok. I feel like I have to talk louder than usual though."
3,Jabra,"Not bad for the money $3.50! However, the microphone is not great and some people are not hearing me loud enough. The sound from the headset is loud or low sometimes and I had to adjust the volume contanly. After every call the end call sound is very loud which is very anoing. But I'm cheap and for that much money it does the work for me"
3,Beware of Vendor!,"I own two of these headsets, like their simplicity and reliability, so I decided to purchase a couple for a friend. The new ones are awful -- can barely hear caller. (Caller can hear me fine.) Tested on three phones, same result.All I can guess is that the product I purchased from this vendor is a refurbished or gray market product -- quite inferior to the two I currently own and use regularly."
3,Good Qulaity with lots of extras but not for me.,"I am on the phone 12-14 hours a day, mostly on a landline phone and had been looking for regulat headsets, when I came upon these pieces for throw away prices. Lots of attachments came with this piece but it was very uncomfortable for the ear and for listening. But how can I complain about the price, so now its in storage. Please refer to other reviewers for more indepth information."
2,Not the same as the Jabra C250 purchased at Walmart,"The price was right and the delivery was quick. It was not the same, however, as the Jabra C250 purchased at Walmart. The one purchased at Walmart was more but it has an ""answer/end button"" located on the earpiece. That is a really great feature. Because the model number is exactly the same, I assumed it would be the same."
2,Doesn't Last,"I bought one of these as my first hands-free and absolutely loved it. Unfortunately it stopped working after a bit over a year. I thought it was a fluke and bought a second one. That one lasted me 8 months. The company claims this is normal and won't give any kind of refund/credit/etc--they say it's not defective. If that's the case, then I strongly recommend NOT buying this unit. It should definitely last far longer than that--I only used mine approx 4 hrs/wk while they lasted and I consider that light use. Good luck."
4,graete headset.,This headset is a alsome thing to buy. i have a few.It sounds cristle clear. If I was you. I would buy it.
1,Bad Product,I was excited to get this product until it broke in my hand as soon as I opened it and got it out from the bag. I taped the ear piece back together but I can't hear a damn thing. I'm not sure if it is b/c of the ear piece being broken or if it is poor quality. I would not try this product again. I looked at newer versions from the same company but they all look poorly made.
3,price ant too bad,I gotten complaints that I sounded far away with this headset. I also have a hard time of hearing even though its an in-ear bud. It has it good days and bad.
3,Jabra C250 EarWave Boom Headset,"The headset is OK... not great... just OK. The sound is crisp and clear BUT the ear piece doesn't fit snugly in the ear. The ""hook"" that goes over the ear is flexible but it can't be adjusted to where it will stay put making it possible for the headset to fall off of the ear with the slightest movement of your head. I would not purchase this item again and would not recommend it to my friends. Overall, I would say that I'm quite disappointed."
2,"after multiple Jabra purchases, I switched to plantronics 500mx","I have purchased maybe half a dozen of these Jabra things since 2006. They work well enough but they always eventually crap out. I don't mishandle or over use them particularly, either, they just crap out after awhile. They're fine if you can reconcile yourself to having to replace them periodically.Last time I bought multiples and the last one just died. There don't appear to be any particularly high quality, over/under the ear wired cell phone headsets out there, but I decided it was time to try something else.The plantronics unit costs more and got generally more favorable reviews, although they seem to crap out periodically, too. Oh, well. Gotta choose from what's out there."
2,"Nice wired headset, poor design.",I was slightly disappointed with the design of this product. It's hard to get the earpiece to stay put comfortably. Awkward to use compared to similar products.
5,Love this Jabra for home use,This Jabra C250 EarWave Boom Headset came to me in good condition. It is very good to use in noise free conditions only.It works well for me.Thank you
4,Very good product,"This product works very well. I can hear fine, and most of the time, they can hear me fine on the other side too. Sometimes they say it's a little hard to hear me. Makes it much easier and safer to talk and drive at same time!"
3,Tinty,"Those who I talk on the phone with (a regular phone/not a cellphone) say that I sound like I'm speaking in a tin can. I guess for 4 bucks, I get what I pay for..."
1,Wrong product sent to me,"Gee, it would be great if I could review the correct product. You know, the one I ordered. That's not what I received. And since, I've had a hell of a time getting any satisfaction from this seller. Then, I reviewed the buyer comments on this seller (many many scathing reviews) and realized I never should've bought from this seller to begin with. BUYER BEWARE. The company has since told me they sent the correct product (and that it was delivered to my home). I can promise you it was not. I can also promise you that if I had the correct product in hand, I wouldn't be spending my time and energy complaining about this. I'd be done with that seller once and for all. As it turns out, I'm not. And that's a real drag."
2,Faint volume from mic makes it a no-go,"Bottom line: can't use because the volume of my voice is too low for people to easily hear. Bought off of ebay after my c200 cord was cut. The c200 worked well, but this c250 with the longer ""boom"" mic extension was not as loud. Jabra headsets are very comfortable and easy to wear all day. Reasonably easy to put on with one hand once you get the hang of it. I am not sure if my problem was unusual, but these corded headsets seem to be hit or miss. I have had other brands where the sound quality is not very good or too low.I will just reorder another c200 and take my chances with that."
5,Remarkably confortable.,This headset is very light and comfortable. The earpiece is angled at 90 degrees to fit directly in to the ear canal. Fidelity is great at both ends.
4,"Works well, good sound quality.",Today I received the Jabra C250 and the Jabra C500 headsets. The C500 is better designed for use with cellular phones but the sound quality in the ear piece and microphone is not as tood at the C250. The person I called compared the two devices and said the C250 was like AT&T wireless voice quality (talking in a tunnel). The C250 was also a bit more comfortable in my ear. All things considered I would buy another.
3,Work well but for only about 2-3 months,The good news is they are inexpensive. The bad news the only work for a few months before they go dead. For me they worked out ok but the hastle in the end made me switch to another phone with Bluetooth.
1,Not what I was hoping for,"This headset is stiff, doesn't fit completely in my ear, and the sound quality is awful. Now I know why it was so cheap. Don't bother!"
1,Headset makes you sound like you're in a tunnel,"I bought this headset because I had purchased a Jabra ear bud headset for my cell phone and I love it. I needed a headset for my regular phone since I spend a lot of time on conference calls. The headset was very reasonably priced, but the first time I used it, the people on the call said I sounded like I was in a tunnel and muffled. Needless to say I'm no longer using it."
3,Headset,Nice unit but does not work well with my Garmin 660 plug in. Incoming voice is good but poor audio going out as all wireless or wired headset are.
1,Stay away from this headphone,"This headphone is awful. The boom barely goes to my jaw, and NOBODY can hear me on it. They also hurt my ears. I've never experienced this sort of problem with any other headphone, including small ones. Spend your money on something else - these simply don't do the job."
3,Cell Phone Headsets,We purchased 3 of these because of their low price. They work ok but my husband has had trouble hearing the other person who either has called him or he has called. Overall the headset is ok but we probably would do some more searching next time before buying these again.
3,"For the price, an excellent ear-piece.","I ordered one to try and was not disappointed. The sound quality and volume are excellent, and you sure can't beat the price. I ding it one star as it can be a bit cumbersome to put on, particularly when wearing glasses. This is a minor issue however, as I have ordered two more pairs.I have just reduced my rating by one star. Of the 2 additional headsets, one did not function at all (being replaced). Also, unlike the previous 2 units I have purchased, they came with the shortest length ear-gel. This makes it very difficult to use, at least for me. I must constantly push on the unit to get adequate volume into my ear.These work very well, just be sure you are getting the appropriate length ear-gels."
3,Good sound but minigel is too big,"The sound is good. I use it with a Samsung phone. However, the minigel is too big to fit in my ears. I have to leave it hanging loosely on my ear. It's okay if I'm just sitting, but doesn't stay put if I'm moving around. It comes in a small, clear plastic bag. If the minigel fits your ears, I think the product is worth a try."
1,Could not hear at all,"I bought two of these Jabra headsets. Neither of them worked with the two phonesI tried them on. I couldn't hear *anything* with either of them. Although callerscould hear me. I bought another headset, which worked fine."
2,Difficult fit,"This Headset is difficult to adjust for a proper fit of the earpiece and microphone. It's uncomfortable. Unless the shape of my head is unusual, I would not recommend it."
3,Share your opinion 3 Select a review type * video camera Video review * Written review Select the video from your,they have contacted me and are working with me to fix my unhappiness with then a company that is will do do this i have give better rating to and say thank you for your help and to make things right
1,not working,"I received my Jabra C250 and when I went to use it for the first time, (3 or 4 days after it had arrived) it did not work. I've had a good experience with using my Jabra bt250v for many years, but the Jabra C250 did not keep that positive experience going and I'm returning it to amazon this week."
3,Lots of potential - but flawed,"Overall ,this has a lot going for it. Cheap, comfortable, and superb sound quality both on the incoming and the outgoing sides. But it also has some issues - or potential issues that everyone should at least consider.1. of the two i bought (surplus, OEM planet), one was defective upon receipt. The wire was broken at the connector. Note that others have reported this fault too. This speaks either badly for QC or for the nature of these surplus units being sold.2. Mine has very low output (mic) volume. The clarity is excellent, but sometimes you must shout to be heard. Again, scanning the reviews it appears some find this fault and others don't. unit to unit variation? Fit? Who knows.I've had one that i bought ages ago (from Verizon) for much more money. Its been a workhorse. I wonder if the standards have slipped, or if i'm unlucky ( and so are others)?Just_me"
4,Works with some phones better than others.,"I received two of these as gifts. They both work the same, so I don't think either is defective. What I've found, though, is that when I use it with my Uniden TRU 4485 cordless phone at home, the person on the other end of the line can barely hear me. Whereas, when I use one of these headsets with my Motorola V180 cellular phone, the other party can hear me just fine. In both cases, I can hear the other party at a decent volume. The clarity of sound I hear on my end is good in both cases, as well. I've also found the headset to be lightweight, comfortable, and relatively easy to put on and take off. It also stays in my ear fairly reliably."
1,really poor quality on the 360,"Just received it today from A1 Accessories. I bought it solely to use on xbox live so I wouldn't have to keep moving my other headset that I use for work (I work at home). My friends kept asking me to repeat myself. One said that he had to turn down his tv volume so he could hear me (no lie). I switched back to the other headset and I was back to crystal clarity. After that, I threw this one in the trash.. Good thing it only cost me $5 or so."
2,Too much static,"I recently purchased this item because of the high user ratings but it was ineffective when driving on the highway. I'm thinking the mouthpiece is too far away when there is heavy traffic. It worked fine for the first few days and then listeners kept telling me they couldn't hear me because of the static. I stopped using it. It was very comfortable though. So if you do rural driving primarily, maybe this does warrant a high rating."
1,Junk,Decent sound in the ear but microphone sound quality was TERRIBLE. Everyone I talk to says I sound like I am at the bottom of a mine when I use this thing. Pure garbage.
2,"Works, but low volume and poor sound","A few years ago, I purchased a Jabra C250 along with my phone. I was quite happy with it - the fit around the ear was comfortable and the sound quality was good. Then two weeks ago, it just died in the middle of a call. Since I had trouble finding an earpiece that fit comfortably before, I decided to purchase the same model again as a replacement.Unfortunately the new Jabra C250 I received from Amazon about a week ago is not of the same quality. Even with the volume turned all the way up, I can barely hear the other person. The sound quality is also not as sharp. I did notice that it said ""Made in China"" on the package, which is never a good sign. And the price was suspiciously low. I guess you get what you pay for. I'll be looking for a new earpiece."
1,Does not work,"I complained about the first Jabra C250 because I could not get it to work. I plugged it into a Panasonic portable phone and did several test calls. There was no sound at all coming through the earphone. I asked for a refund, but they sent me a second headset. It did nothing either. I pressed the button on the mouthpiece several times, still no response. I also plugged it into a cell phone & a different portable. No sound came through those either."
2,Does not work well with Xbox 360,"I bought this earpiece to plug into my Xbox 360 controller and it has had difficulty maintaining crisp, clear audio. For the price it was worth trying, but I wouldn't purchase another one."
4,KATELAND,"STORIES FROM THE DARK SIDE...True kidnaping stories, its bloody and brutal, these people are snached and injected, then find themselves in some celler, and dont even know why they are there. And there is something eles they dont know, that they are now in some other country. It could be Manila, Brazil, Mexico or Colombia. They are blond hair, blue eyed young ladys. Or wealthy business men. Scientists and Children. Some are tortured and put through hell. There is a special squad formed to help these people and get them out. They call themselves HALO CORP. Dressed like soldiers, with helments and guns, they go in and get these people out, and they are often successful. This is not a film that everyone can watch, it hits you hard at times. They are actors in this documentary, but you do see some of the real victims as they tell of there shocking experiences."
4,caregiver delight,I thought I was the only 1 caring for an aging parent and this book certainly helped me realize I was not alone and gave me many good tips about self care and caring for tips from the parent . I would recommended the caregivers
3,Not quite what I was looking for,"I was hoping that, along with comforting words, the book would be centered on God and the Bible. I don't doubt that it can be helpful to those dealing with the daily struggles of being a caregiver, but without the Word of God, it is only human comfort, not the powerful comfort that brings the ""peace of God, which transcends all understanding"" (Philippians 4:7). If it helps you, however, God bless you and keep you."
1,A rip-off on Harry Potter,"I got this as a gift, and was pretty disappointd in the content. Its pretty thin and its not written that well. Basically a list of stuff in the actual books. A cheesy way for someone to make $ I guess. Dont waste your bucks on this one!"
1,Good Printer -- Boneheads at HP,"The hardware is good, but don't expect the advanced functionality to work well. Boneheads at HP have refused to update the software for this printer. My printer was only a few months old when someone made the decision not to provide Vista drivers for the advance functions."
2,All-in-None,"2 stars -- one for faxing and one for copying.Don't look to this machine if you need any scanning capabilities though, esp. if using a Mac. Can't get it play nicely with Vuescan or Adobe Acrobat; i.e., neither program can detect the LJ 3800. So, that forces me to use the hp Scan program, which is clumsy to say the least.1. I'm used to the 2-step Preview/Scan process that every other program uses, but it doesn't seem to work this way with the 3380. Not sure what's up with this.2. Saving the scans also is a bear. After I save one scan, I expect the program to remember my destination folder instead of forcing me to set it every time I want to save a file. What a drag!"
1,One of the worst...,"This is, in my opinion one of the worst Doctor Who Serials ever! The only things we see in this is a rapping ringmaster that can't rap and Ace proving she's normal by claiming that she has a problem with clowns. All together you can skip this one and you wouldn't miss a thing."
4,"""Let me entertain you...""","The intrusion of junkmail materialising in the TARDIS, leads the Doctor and Ace to the Planet Seganox, where the main attraction is the Psychic Circus, where clowns are sinister, and the audience has to perform for their lives! After an inauspicous debut for Stephen Wyatt with ""Paradise Towers"", ""Greatest..."" is like Hamlet! One of the most psychadelic Who stories since ""The Claws of Axos"". Everyone involved is in fine form, even with the production nightmare. The last two seasons of Who are filled with layers of intrigue and mystery, something lacking in the program since the Hartnell and Troughton eras. Some might say that this adventure is a metaphor of the production, the fans and the program's adversaries(such as Star Trek, the executives of the BBC, ect). Whiz Kidd is every Doctor Who fan in an exagerated form. The Doctor leaving the Circus at the end as the tent explodes is not to be missed! ""You ain't seen nothing yet!"""
1,Two Words- Rapping Ringmaster,"This story falls under a very small category of Dr. Who for me... episodes I'm too scared to watch. From the moment the rapping ringmaster cracks his whip and starts to gyrate to the corny rapping beat you know this is going to be a pretty bad episode. The character names are ridiculous... Pig Pen, Kingpin, and Flower Child. The particulars of the plot are annoying... people going out to perform for the Gods of Ragnorock. We've got a corny, nerdy fan boy, an effete English explorer, and a Werewolf with all the scariness of a member of ths cast of Cats. How could even the most talented actor do a good job pulling off a story with names, costumes, and dialogue like this! There's also a scene where the doctor performs vaudeville style which just doesn't work on TV. The decline of Dr. Who was not Sylvester Mckoy&#65533;s fault however. He was a good Doctor on a bad show. Nor was it John Nathan Turner&#65533;s fault..."
2,Passable Offal,"I actually disagree with those who consider this one of the worst ever episodes of Doctor Who, a hard standard to meet by any stretch of the (my) imagination. This episode is perfectly representative of what Doctor Who was becoming by the era of the last two Doctors: Underfunded camp pantomime dreck -- Precisely what the BBC execs. always intended for the show, and precisely the excuse they were looking for to drive the ratings low enough to justify cancelling the rotten thing. Setting the whole absurd episode in a ridiculous circus tent was pure brilliance and drives the point home beautifully.- M. Grade, professional Who-hater Esq."
4,Muzak for hipsters,"This album is the quintessential illustration of Sunahara's unique place on the pop continuum. He's the spiritual successor to Martin Denny, Esquivel and other seminal lounge artists. That's not to say that his music sounds like retro-lounge. Rather, it seems to be inspired by the same values: a love of soothing music and gracious living. On his other albums, Sunahara has dabbled in funky jazz. On _Love Beat_, the funk has been drained out and we're left with pure and seamless background music."
2,An Over-view of the Subject.,"For my purposes the book is a waste of time. If you know pretty much nothing about the subject, it's okay. But the author's schemata is not standard practice. One of the other reviewers noted that the book doesnt address the realities of the criminal justice system, and theyre correct. Criminal Justice is not CSI or LAW & ORDER. It's more like Kabuki Theatre, where the players act-out rigid roles and the truth be damned. I'm thinking of a local event where the victim phones 911 when a rapist comes into her home, the police refuse to even search the residence when they respond, and after she's raped the detective insists she made the whole thing up. Except she didnt. Lawsuits for incompetence cost police departments fortunes. I suppose if PDs used some sort of script to do their work it would be something like what this book offers."
4,Great way to learn the basics,"This was the required text for a Hebrew class I am taking. I found the book easy to understand and use. Each chapter is summarized with a list of ""shortcuts"" that are very helpful in understanding the basics of Hebrew. The only negative is that the enphasis is on mechanics. Much of why things are as they are in Hebrew is becuase of how it is spoken. That perspective had to be added by my professor.I'm not planning to become a Hebrew scholar, but would like to understand what I am reading when I use a Lexicon or other tool. This book is excellent for someone who wants that kind of understanding."
3,"Useful, but ....","This is a good and useful book if all you want to do is check out a particular word or phrase in a Hebrew lexicon (i.e., BDB) but it is in no way a substitute for a regular course of study in Biblical Hebrew.If you really want to understand Biblical Hebrew and work with it, you need to settle in for slogging through to the end of a couple of semesters of study.On the other hand, if what you really want is a 'once over lightly', this would be an excellent choice."
4,Best movie,Dustin Hoffman plays this character to the tee. It introduced a whole era of cross dressers. You will love it.
5,Dustin Hoffman UNSTOPPABLE,"Anyone who says this movie plays off of other cross-dressing movies is seriously mistaking. Tootsie enhanced it. With superb acting, hysterical script, and great direction Tootsie is the funniest movie ever created. The timing Dustin Hoffman has makes the whole movie worth watching over and over and over again. YOU MUST BUY THIS MOVIE!"
5,Tootsie 25th Anniv Edition,"I can't believe this movie has really been out for more than 25 years! It is still as fresh and funny as the first time I saw it. Marvelous performances by great actors (Jessica Lange, Teri Garr, Bill Murray, Sidney Pollack and others). I have to say that this performance is one of Dustin Hoffman's best of his career. He was absolutely outstanding - so believable and vulnerable. It must have been a difficult character to play but he totally nailed it. This is still one of my all time favorite movies."
3,Great Transacton,This was a great purchase and at a great price. It arrived on time and in perfect condition. Once again I find on Amazon what exactly what I'm looking for and can't find locally. However the movie is not as good as I remembered it being.
5,funny and provocative,"The DVD about the making of the movie is worth the price of this excellent set. And, except for the music, I think the movie holds up VERY well over time."
5,Dustin at his off-beat best...,"I guess I've seen this at least five times over the years, but it is always enjoyable. Hoffman is fascinating to watch as he switches from failed male actor to successful female TV star. An excellent supporting cast helps as well, and in fact, all the elements came together for the production team on this project. If you missed it, make a point of remedying that gap in your knowledge of successful movies."
4,funny movie,"This is the funnist movie. A man cannot get a job on a soap so he dresses as a women, tries again & get hired. He even has a man want to date him as the woman"
3,No thanks,"I am hoping that it is not just myself that feel sthe two biggest grossing movies with male/female switching roles are played by in this case Dustin Hoffman and in the case of Mrs Doubtfire by Robin Williams.This may seem a case of what i syour point,and i will tell you both of these Actors Hoffman especially is fantastic as the male he plays in so many movies,as is Williams in the right movie not some of the drivel that he has unfortunately taken on at times.Anyway that i sthe case here,i cannot get past the fact that that is Dustin Hoffman as a woman,and my goodness he makes an ugly lady.Having taken that into account the movie is alright,nothing special but a bit of light entertainment.I am definitely a fan of Hoffman's and this movie did very well for all concerned,i am forever grateful that he put away that dress and hairstyle having said that.Ian."
3,Transexuals hit the mainstream...,This movie is about a post-op transexual who runs for a political office. She falls in love with a woman and begins to question her choice to have gender reassignment surgery when the object of her affection refuses to have gender reassignment surgery herself. Odd film but good acting.
5,The best film comedy of the 1980s,"The story of a ""difficult"" actor finding success by dressing as a woman is turned into one of the all-time great film comedies. Dustin Hoffman's performance in the lead role is quite simply stunning and Jessica Lange has just the right touch of aloofness as a soap actor and love interest. Aside from the hilarious comedy it is also a film of great humanity and warmth. The ""It might be you"" segment about half way through - masterfully sung by Stephen Bishop - is one of the greatest moments in cinema. Definitely a must see."
5,"Great movie, greater meaning behind it.","Tootsie is a great movie. I loved it as a kid and will still watch it anytime it's on. Dustin Hoffman played Dorothy which such class and he recently elaborated on why he took the part on AFI's 100 Years/100 Films special. He said to his wife that he had to play the part and she asked why. He said because he would make an ""interesting looking"" woman and he began to realize all of the wonderful women he never had a chance to know in his life because of their interesting appearances and just dismissing them, as Dorothy was dimissed. He was almost in tears as he said this, which teared me up. It's THAT passion that he put into the character of Dorothy and made the story so much more than the script intended."
5,Tootsie-25th Anniversary Edition,"-Tootsie, what a truly entertainment--not only did Dustin Hoffman do a GREAT performance of being a WOMAN. Love--Bill Murray, as Dustin's room mate in the story, he is so funny."
5,Harvey's favorite treat.....,This has been our miniature dachshund Harvey's favorite treat for a few years and now we can't find them anywhere. They had great ingredients and every dog we've ever offered one to just loved them. What gives...why can't we get them now?
5,I bought the 1st set and the 2nd set the very next week!,My headline should tell you what I think. It is a great set to own. I enjoy them each time I watch. Farnon reminds me so much of my boss it is scarey!
5,All Creatures Great & Small Series 1 & 2,"I have looked at both series over and over. Please, please hurry and produce the next volume of programmes. Definitely the best television series I have ever seen. The programmes are classics and the attention to detail, the acting, the scenery is out of this world. One never tires of seeing them, I will keep checking with Amazon.com for Series 3, 4 and so on until I have exhausted the programmes produced. Hurry!"
5,Love the series!,"Excellent series about a country vet's life and adventures during the 30-40s. Set in the lovely English countryside with funny characters! The books were beautifully written, and the series follows very closely to the stories from each one!"
4,There is always a but...,"I gave the book four stars because, for the price, it's got a lot of good information and stretches. The flexibility assessment, while long, is interesting to see where problems are. I always thought my hamstrings were too tight; turns out it's actually my calves.However, the stretches can be confusing, and I didn't realize at first that I was doing one of them completely wrong.Also, the book claims that you can do a complete routine in 20 minutes. I don't know how they do it, but it takes me over an hour to do all 59 stretches. 2 s (stretch) + 1 s (rest) * 10 reps * 59 exercises = ~30 minutes, plus some of the exercises are both sides, plus time to change position, etc...so maybe after I had all the exercises memorized I could get it down to 45 minutes."
3,It helps to get the DVD,Gave the book 3 stars just because I too was having problems figuring out the exercises in the book and decided to get their DVD. The DVD takes out all of the guess work and gives you 48 mintues of great exercises. Book: 3 Stars. DVD: 5 stars.
5,"I'm a ""flying-by-the-seat-of-my-pants"" student!","I ordered two weeks before classes started and I received my book the following week! Thank you for your prompt, professional and perfect care of my needs! And you didn't even know my time schedule!"
4,Give Credit Where Credit Is Due,"I learned AIS from a 2 day hands on course from Aaron Mattis, the author and Inventor of AIS. He developed the techniques found in this book, and should be given full credit from the authors. I encourage anyone interested in learning more about AIS, to contact Aaron Mattis in Florida and find out where he will be teaching his Courses. He's an excellent instructor, and was the teacher for the guys that wrote this book."
2,Of limited use,Took a few exercises out of it for my core routine (I am a runner and need to do core exercises).But it is not a complete book of exercises you need to do as a runner; too narrow.
4,A Great Stretch,"I saw Jim Wharton at a clinic for the Avon 3-Day Breast Cancer walk in NYC. I was very tight and stiff with reoccuring pain in my ankles and knees. I already did a good stretch routine in addition to morning Yoga, but I couldn't build flexibility. After just a few weeks of using this stretch program the stiffness and pain started going away. I could also get more out of my workouts and my flexibility was up. The book is pretty easy to use. You look up the activity you do and the book matches it with the right stretches. The stretching routines are long, but there are a lot of muscles to be dealt with. The diagrams are a little confusing but can be figured out. The written discriptions are easy to work with. I think this is a great book to use as an alternative stretch program."
1,Desperately needs revision,"Here is what is wrong with this book:It needs about 4 times the amount of illustrations. There should be three or four of each stretch showing it from different angles. It would also be helpful to highlight which muscles one is supposed to be stretching, and which ones one is supposed to be contracting. Since I didn't major in anatomy, I had to use google to figure out what I was supposed to be doing. I'm betting most people who buy this book will not have as much perserverence as I had.After trying the stretches for about 2 weeks, I didn't see much improvement. Then I caught a Youtube of the Dana Torres DVD. I tried the stretch as shown. It was challenging, but the instruction was clear. And better yet, I immediately did the deepest forward bend I've ever done.I ordered the DVD and gave the Wharton book away. I only wish I hadn't squandered my time and money on it."
2,Not good for injuries,"Although the book provides some good ideas for stretching, I found the shortened stretching to be almost ballistic in nature. The exercises really aggravated some old sports injuries after several weeks of following the routine. Also, the routine is long; don't believe the authors when they tell you 20 minutes to complete."
2,Not a very good book.,"I thought this book was put together very poorly. I have been lifting weights for about 9 months and am looking to add some stretching to my routine. The thing that attracted me to this book was the quantity of stretches it presented. I also think that the program, in theory, makes sense. That brings me to the issues I have with this book.The stretches were poorly illustrated and described. Stretches that require any sort of 3d movement were especially difficult to decipher. The learning curve for this program, in my opinion, is to big for beginners. I also don't see how this program could be completed in 20 minutes. This book could have potential if the section describing the stretches was completely redone. Then at least it would be useful as an encyclopedia of stretches."
5,a must have for any level of fitness,"I am a certified fitness trainer and although there is an ongoing debate about the usefulness of stretching pre-workout, I am here to tell all of you who read this that Active Isolated Stretching is the answer to warm-up stretching and the Whartons Book is very easy to read, follow, and understand. I recomend this book to anyone who has a habit of over stretching causing muscle soreness and tightness."
2,Poor illustrations make book almost unusable,"The pencil drawings are terrible. In the pictures requiring you to bend your knees, it's almost impossible to tell whether to bend the knee toward the chest, at a right angle from the body, etc. The text doesn't help clarify matters in most cases, and besides, if I'm actually doing the stretches, I don't want to take the time to read the wordy descriptions.The ""sports-specific"" section is anything but. For the most part, they instruct you do to all the stretches, maybe in varying order. Far too time consuming for most people.Finally, I found it quite difficult in some cases to ""contract the opposite muscle"" to make the stretch effective. And in any case, I find that focusing on the opposite muscle contracting takes the enjoyment out of feeling the stretch."
4,owney's life,A good first-person account of Owney madden's criminal life. The author portrays himself as Owney and describes his life--good and bad.
1,"What does it mean "" great canibbalism film"" ???!!!","What does it mean a ""great cannibalism film"" ??!! Is ""CAnibalism"" now a genre of movies, like for example comedy, horror, suspense, drama, etc ...?? This movie is a bad joke, an unbeliavable display of bad taste as I have seldom seen before. I'm not a little bit shocked by the free violence displayed all along, that's not the problem. The problem is the sheer stupidity of the screenplay, the kind of movie that you cannot stop thinking: ""Oh, boy, why did someone spent some budget on this ?"""
1,"Well, how unfortunate......","This actually had alot of promise to it. But sadly, bad acting and a stupid screenplay ruined what could have been a great horror movie. David Arquette also ruined it with his appearance as well. What really got to me was this: that the villain in the movie got powers from eating the flesh of other people. This is a highly unrealistic idea. The villain should've just been a vampire instead!"
4,I'm a vegetarian...,"...and I loved this movie! I missed it in the theater, but caught it on video, and thoroughly enthralled, watched it again. Not having had enough, I rented the DVD later and watched all of the commentaries. And now I'm ordering it on DVD. It's that good. I've never seen a movie that blends horror, history, mythology and humor in this fashion. The scenery (the movie was filmed in Poland and Slovakia) and the music are breathtakingly beautiful. The characters are interestingly developed (I've never seen Jeffrey Jones play a role like this) and the story moves you right along. You don't have to understand the concept of cannibalism, or be sympathetic to it, to enjoy this film. Clever, memorable, and a good story as well, that stands on its own strength, rather than relying on big names."
2,The other red meat...,"Curious film. More different then entertainng. Passable direction, but not particullarly stylish or artful. Opportunities to make an audience tense, or shocked, were not taken advantage of. Things just happen, without the enjoyable rollercoaster ride of tension and release. Some good actors, doing a decent job. Scenery in the mountains during winter was enjoyable. Soundtrack is an example of inept composition, and didn't seem to fit what was occuring on the screen either. Composing music in general, and composing music to heighten the effect of a film story, are two different things. A one time watch curiosity, at best. If you enjoyed this film, may I suggest ""Brotherhood of the Wolf""...a much superior French film."
1,A MASTERPIECE ? !,"Well, if this one is a master-piece, I'll start to write my own screenplays from now on ... THis movie is so bad, so horrible. I'm not talking about the canibalism, I don't care about it at all. I'm talking aboud bad direction and bad acting (except for Carlyle) and a totally unconvincing plot, full of holes. It's a total disgrace to the industry of film-making that studios accept to shoot this thing. What a shame .."
1,Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen!,This was the worst movie I've ever seen. I had to force myself to sit through it. By the end of the film I felt really nauseous. I've have not been able to eat red meat since viewing this film. Honestly I thought i had a stronge stomach but the extent the director goes through to show the murder and cutting up of the victims is un-necessary to get the point and effect of the movie. I stronglly advice those with a weak stomach not to watch this movie.
1,what?,"this is the last time i buy a movie based on reviews. this movie absolutely sucked. gore? you've got to be kidding. the plot sucked, the effects sucked, it made no sense. the soundtrack was the best part of the film. the cast was great and it had lots of potential but fell way short of anything but 1 star. next time i will research the people writing reviews more than the movie itself to make sure they have an idea of what they are commenting on. 101 5 star idiots and counting."
1,EAT SOMETHING ELSE,"I can't say anything good about this ""movie"".The idea is bad, the movie is bad, the actors are regular, and the story is bad.Ravenous is one of that films you could use to start a nice fire."
4,Not for the faint-of-heart,This extremely gory tale is just one of those movies that affects you after you see it. It just stays in your mind.I think anyone that is not intimidated or easily grossed out by blood should give the film a chance. The setting and music is excellent as well...
5,Overlooked Cult Classic,"The first time I saw ""Ravenous"" I wasn't sure what I had gotten my teeth into, but by the end of the film, I realized this under-rated and overlooked film was going to be an instant cult classic. Guy Pearce underplays his role perfectly, Jeffrey Jones does very well in support, and Robert Carlyle is evil frontier sophistication incarnate. And the theme music stays in your head. The problem is, how to approach your friends about it: ""Hey, why don't you come over for dinner, and we can watch this great movie on cannibalism!"" Yeah, right. The trick is, don't tell them what the subject matter is, and by the time they figure it out, they will be hooked on the movie, too. Everyone I have tried this approach with have eventually gone out and purchased the DVD for their own collections. About the only disturbing thing is, every time I see this movie, I feel the urge to go to Black Angus for a Rib-eye, Medium Rare. Coincidence?"
4,It was fun,Was it a groun breaking film. No. But it was a great deal of fun.It was interesting how the film made steak look revolting but a stew look absolutely appetizing.
3,ewwwww- boring,"I heard about this moving like it was going to be great. When I got it the plot seemed to go on forever with very few twist, and rather predictable. The picture was not great, aand was not a horror movie at all in my opinion... I expected more."
3,Good movie,"I missed this in the theatres, and I think that was a mistake on my part. This movie tells a tale of men gone mad due to cannibalism. Most striking is the way Bird presesnts a story set in the 19th century in a very modern way with a wonderful score. The music often makes the movie, and this is one of those cases where it really makes it a good movie. I was hoping for a bit more after a promising start, but a fun ride indeed. Bird is a director to watch."
5,A great horror movie!,I just watched the other night at a friends house. Now I am like this is one of those DVD's I must have. This movie is funny in its own way and yet sicking. I found myself laughing through a good chunk of it. Ravenous is now like in my top ten movie list along with Trainspotting.If you haven't seen this movie at least rent it. Just don't watch it at like 3am in the dark by yourself.
4,want to convert to vegetarianism?,"I saw in the pro reviews that this movie had mistakenly been passed for dark comedy and flopped anyway. I understand it. This movie flopped because it's very very special and is not appealing for a large audience.I discovered this movie by chance and mistake : I was with a friend who loves cinema and we wanted to see a movie, this one was on show, and we chose it by chance (well, maybe *she* had heard of it or of the realisator). It was a shock. This film may have some humor, but it is first and foremost gore, heck, it made a major meat eater like me a vegetarian for a fortnight.well, this said, it is excellently made, and I enjoyed it tremendously. it does show a very interesting angle on cannibalism, and I think I remember something about the legend of the Wendigo. (heck, I wish I could see it again, but I got no budget for DVDs, want to gift me with it?). For the strong of stomach, but a real good piece"
4,bloody great,"We all know this one bombed at the box office and few good celebs thought this one was good like Leonard Maltin and Roger Ebert and I do as well. I liked it from beginning to end. Cannibalism is great in this movie and it sets up the feeling of a hungry guy. Carlyle and Pearce's battle at the end is the treat with them sticking any weapon into one another. a great story told and a funny performance by Arquette, though he dies here and I hope im not spoiling this for someone"
4,It will consume you.,"""Ravenous"" is such a surprise film. Normally, I wouldn't be interested in this sort of film--White Zombie being played in the preview, David Arquette, lots of blood and gore, but once again, this is simply proof that mass-marketing can conquer one's desire to see a film. Luckily, there was something that made me want to see ""Ravenous"". So when I finally did watch ""Ravenous"" I was VERY pleased. Sure, there's lots of blood and gore, but there are also serious dynamics that some might even relate to the sexual politics of meat (Refer to the book by Carol J.Adams). The music is beautiful (mostly by Damon from Blur), but sometimes did not seem to go along with particular scenes. The acting is superb. Those who are like me, will be happy to know that there is no White Zombie or much David Arquette in the film. The ending is symbolically beautiful. Not for everyone, but totally enthralling. Oh, and the ending (music and all) struck me as oddly reminiscent of a Hal Hartley ending."
3,Disappointing,"A great concept and mostly a great cast that are sabotaged by a horrible score, clunky directing, and goofy one-liners. Just as the film begins to establish a creepy mood of the 1840s wilderness, a character tosses off a jokey, anachronistic one-liner or the music lurches into something better suited for a sit-com. And David Arquette's wacko character is totally unbelievable and a huge distraction. Pity--this could have been a much better movie with just a little extra effort."
2,1 star for Guy Pearce and 1 star for Robert Carlyle,"I am a big fan of both Pearce and Carlyle and thought they were both very good in this disgusting movie. I didn't even want to rent it. or see it in the theater...why would i want to watch a movie about cannibals? my husband was the one who picked this one.. i would never take that responsibility. The whole premise of this movie is disturbing, and i don't think that eating human flesh could make one anymore virile than chicken or steak. (robert carlyle said something like that). this was a sick film, althought the ending was a fitting one. better off watching l.a. confidential or Full monty if you want to see a good film with both these fine actors."
2,Raving Lunatics more like it...,"Ravenous plays like vampire movie, offering more supernatural guidelines than I expected. If Dances with Wolves crossed paths with Hannibal Lecter and Bela Lugosi, you would get this amusing, though rather convulted story involving the members of a remote mountain outpost in the Sierras. It was offbeat, bloody, and tasteless, somethings I generally admire in a film. But this movie falls short for some reason. I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe it just doesn't have enough bite."
2,primitive cannabilistic vampires of 1846,"this movie has a good plot, but i recommend this film to older adults (ages:25 and up)the movie has alot of blood scenes. this movie is about a primitive cannabalistic vampire who is out to hunt for food(humans)the movie has okay action,it has suspense. Guy Pierce is the main guy in the movie and he plays a U.S. Army Captain. The movie could have used more fight and gun attack scenes, but it is good. The ending of the film is not the typical way a movie should end especially for the protagonist, but you have to get the big picture why it happens. Recommended it!"
3,unsure,This movie was good the last time I saw it. However when I bought it this time I was unaware of PAL codes and was unable to play the disc.
4,New Cult Classic,"A masterpiece that eludes classification. Its genre is a hodge-podge mixture of horror, western, period, comedy, thriller. It's a man's journey to find courage. It's a disection and exploration of humanity's darkest side. And it's shockingly funny in both dialogue and the unexpected. Its last scene is haunting, gruesome, and will leave a bad taste in your mouth, underscored by a hypnotic soundtrack that will only enhance the unwholesome atomsphere. You desperately want a bath after this thing is over and a plate of fresh vegetables ... and you won't know who to trust."
3,"A nostalgic, inaccurate tale of 1881 Tombstone","I am sorry to disagree with most of the reviewers of this film. John Ford, as usual, presents a sentimental tale of Wyatt Earp in Tombstone, but he was notorious of disregarding the locals and the actual events. The most glaring mistake was the gunfight at the OK corral which the movie'Tombstone' accurately showed, but not in the present movie. I have been to Tombstone many times. The most ridiculous mistake was casting Victure Mature as Doc Holiday. This was a joke. I have seen Mature a few times, he was a big, husky guy just right to play Samson. Google 'Doc Holiday' and see how he looked like. He was a sickly, skinny, man. But, John Ford was a master in presenting the 'spirit of the west' that we all love and cherish."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:If you want to come away from a movie thinking that the Old West was the most slow, boring place in the world then My Darling Clementine is the movie for you; unexpectedly beloved, this John Ford ""classic"" is only sucessful in showing that even the gunfight at the O.K. Corral can be made dull by the right director."
2,Complete Fiction,"While there has never been a completely factual account of the life of Wyatt Earp (""Tombstone"" comes the closest), this film is completely fictional. First, Wyatt isn't even married in this version, and he becomes enamored with a woman named Clementine; thus the title. Doc Holliday was a dentist, but in this film, he is a surgeon who operates on a wounded bargirl he loves.As a piece of Western Fiction, this film would be alright, but since it was decided to use the names Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday and the OK Corral, the entire project is distracting. The only accurate facts in this film, are that there was a Wyatt Earp, a Doc Holliday and an OK Corral. If it wasn't for the excellent performances of Henry Fonda, and especially, Walter Brennen, I would have given this film one star."
1,A REAL CLUNKER,".....This is probably the worst movie that Ford ever made. I video taped this movie because of the stature of FORD & FONDA but after watching it once I deleted it because it was not worth saving......It would take a tome to recount the many absurdities in this film starting with the location, Monument Valley, which is far removed from Tombstone, to the casting of the burly robust Victor Mature as the thin, frail, dying of consumption, Doc Holliday. Mature's range as an actor was limited, he was in his milieu as Sampson in Sampson and Deliah, but to attempt to pass him off as a refined, educated, intellectual pushed my credibility beyond its limit......FONDA played the frontier lawman EARP as an addled Aw Shucks Ma'am simpleton and was totally unbelievable.....The Gufight at OK Corral has been distorted enough by historical mythology without corrupting it more by ridiculous and nonsensical movie farce"
5,Back to the OK Corral,"Amidst the many film treatments of the events leading up to the gunfight at the OK Corral, this very early one looms large. Henry Fonda is wonderful (as usual) in the role of Wyatt Earp, and Victor Mature, though a bit robust for the frail, tubercular Doc Holliday, does a great job of evoking his intelligence, erudition, courage and even illness. Highly recommended."
5,Great gift for the husband,My husband loved this movie! I bought it for him because he loves watching westerns and he greatly enjoyed it. He still enjoys it! It is one of the greatest westerns ever!
3,great old movie,"My customer is very happy that I could find this movie for him, so he could add it to the collection he plans to take on his cruise around the world."
3,Passable,"My main problem with this DVD is that it is a 2 sided DVD and therefore lacks a cover picture on it, one side has the final release film after the studio heavies ""improved"" it with the other side being a pre-release version missing about half an hour.With the release of this DVD one scene was changed to allow it to flow better,{a scene with the approach of a stage coach was re-used and darkened to simulate night and a seated Henry Fonda snipped out, also the rattle of a bell is changed to allow for this and is described in the ""extras""}"
3,This is not an ALL IN ONE,"I actually sent the machine back and am glad I did. Check out the Xerox DocuMate 250 which I bought instead. This machine may be wonderful, but you have to read before you buy. I skimmed over the tech data and got confused. The 3020 is NOT all in one. It is two of the three. The 3030 has the fax capabilities. The 3020 has only the printer and scanner. I pass this on, so you won't have to go through the inconvenience of returning it, because you can't carry this machine back to Office Depot. They won't accept it. Tech Depot is a separate company, though both of the same parent."
4,A most pleasant surprise.,Daughters of Danang is one those movies (documentaries) that sneeks up on you and hits you between the eyes. This movie is a real tear jerker especially because you know you're watching something very real... not staged. If you have any interest in the human dynamics when cultures clash...you have no choice...this is a must see.
3,disappointing,"Airlifted eurasian baby returns to her homeland as twenty-something, is freaked out and disgusted by Viet culture and birth mother. This movie could have conveyed a universal message about quests to find ones' roots, but instead it depicts an idiosyncratic event. The young woman of mixed racial ancestry was raised by insular and uneducated southerners who seem to have mistreated her, and so she became a self-loathing, ethnocentric redneck. Anyone else going back to examine her ethnic roots would probably read a book first and have a minimally realistic understanding of what she was about to see and experience. The culture clash is explained entirely by the adopted southern attitudes of the main character."
2,GOOD RIDE,"ONCE THIS MOVIE GETS STARTED, IT'S WORTH THE WATCH. THEY EVEN GIVE YOU SERVERAL DIFFERANT ENDINGS. IN MY OPINION THE ONE THEY HAD AS THE ENDING WAS THE BEST. LEAVES IT OPEN FOR AN SEQUAL FOR WHICH THEY DID. HAVENN'T SEEN IT YET. BUT I WILL SAY THIS JOY RIDE IS WHAT IT IS. ENTERTAINING AND CREEPY. YOU NEVER GET TO SEE THE VILLIN. I ENJOYED IT AND IM SURE YOU WILL."
4,Hot-Wired Thriller!,"Stalked by a vengeful trucker, three friends race for their lives-it's a thrilling nail-biter with 4 mind blowing alternate endings!I recommend this to anyone who loves thrillers and on the edge of your seat entertainment!!***Check it out!***"
2,Starts well but then..,"Boy oh boy. Where have I seen this movie befor? Oh yeah it was called ""Duel"" and It was much better..This movie starts OK but once the main plot is laid out the rest of the movie is just funny in a bad way..After they trick a Horny low IQ truck driver to a motel room to meet a fictional woman (just for laughs) and hear him kill a person (or did he)? they become the subject of the truckers vengence. I watched curiously as the truckers IQ shoots through the roof.. He suddenly can guess their location on a long stretch of highway with such ease with no logical explanation except that he is a genius.. too bad he fell for their stupid practical joke... if he didn't we won't have this movie.Great candidate for a Rcoky Horror Picture Show like midnight show.Watch ""Duel"" insted. Great movie."
4,FASTER AND MORE FURIOUS,"This movie is AWESOME! Very scary at times. Poor Paul Walker, always getting in car chases. A faster and more furious ride for Paul. Very scary at some parts and is definately worth owning."
5,Never mess around with psychotic truck drivers...,"This movie was total freakishness. It was a disturbing, believable account of two prankster brothers who are forced to learn a lesson that they will never forget. The acting was wonderful, the direction was great, and the story and plot were totally convinving and were not too drawn out. Not your typical Thriller or the typical Teen-Slasher-Movie like ""Scream"" or ""Urban Legend"". The end will send chills down your spine!"
3,Dumb,"A pretty dumb teen horror flick that tries to capture Duel, but doesnt get that far. Sobieski, who's normally good, is just not that great here. Maybe it's the wrong vehicle for her."
4,I'm not your Candycane!,"This was one suspenseful movie! Two of my friends sat me down to watch this one, and I was very happy with it.The plot has been summarized before, so I will avoid that. This movie is very much a tale of suspense that you will keep thinking about for days. Paul Walker and Steve Zahn do really well in this film, but I'm not crazy about Leelee Sobieski. I've seen her in other films, and her acting is the same in all of them, lukewarm.The first half of the movie is really good and you can really get into it, then Leelee's character is introduced and it starts to drag. This is a good movie to watch with a bunch of friends sitting there yelling at the screen.The alternate endings are also very fabulous. Check them out if you haven't seen them yet."
1,Was this a comedy?,"After watching Joy Ride in the theater, I must say that I left more scared by the acting and writing than I did by the plot. The writing was horrible and the logic in the movie terrible. While movies don't necessarily have to be the most realistic portrayals, they should at least be believable. Stupid things that needed explaining were never explained, such as how the truck driver actually knew which car the brothers had. The line ""Candy Cane"" was basically all I left the theaters with. While the idea itself was pretty shaky, it could have been done well. It wasn't. If you want to be scared, don't see Joy Ride. All you will end up seeing is a generic, poorly planned scary movie that really doesn't scare at all."
4,Great Movie with a lot of extras!!!!,"Joy Ride was 100% better than I expected and the extras on this DVD was the best I've seen yet!!! The movie handles about two brothers playing a joke on this truck driver and he ends up going crazy and tries to kill them. The movie didn't lack at all and entertained me very well... the only thing I ddn't like in this movie was the actual ending (Not the deleted ones), it made me somewhat angry BUT there are 4 different ending and on the back of the DVD it says not only deleted scenes, but a whole new movie and they were correct! The deleted scenes that include the ending start somewhere in the middle of the movie and goes all the way until the end, and the only thing i have to say is that the different ending made me happy so i was no longer dissapointed after i watch the other endings! This is a great fil and is a MUST BY!!! The acting was also very good, especially from Steve Zahn and Leelee Sobieski, they played these roles very believable!!"
4,A very scary Joy Ride.....,... Yes at times it had classic horror film happenings which we saw coming but all in all it was a very edge of your seat thriller. We definitly recommend this film for a fun two hours.
4,Worth Your Money,"Joy Ride was a great movie. Aside from some ... opinions that obviously havent seen the movie, it isn't reminisiant of Scream or horror pics. ...This movie has an eerie feeling and is good at freakin you out. The psycho in the truck is well put together, obviously scarry, and yet you can understand how he feels in one scene with leelee sobieski. Also you never really see him which makes him even more freaky. The only reason for the lack of a fifth star is that the ending is somewhat not resolved. Otherwise for the that this movie is definately worth your money and is very enjoyable."
5,Excellent movie!,"Has all the elements and then some to make this a thriller. Don't know why it didnt receive more publicity. Acting is excellent and the mystery of character: ""Rusty Nail"" is veiled by allowing us to only hear his voice intially. Won't say anymore so as not to spoil it."
2,mediocre,"Not particularly scary, and rather ridiculous at times. It wasn't horrible, but it was still a let down. I was a little impatient about the film just finally ending."
5,Great Movie!,"I watchied this movie last night and I was on the edge of my seat. I loved the action and suspense. I think that I've seen a movie like this before, but I don't recall what the name of it is. Anyway it was a great movie and I highly recommend it."
1,When will good movies be made again?,"I saw a screening of this early on, and I have to say...""Why""? Not only is the writing horrible, but the acting... Did they even reherse for this movie? I personally think that John Dahl (director) had a late phone bill or something, because I highly doubt that the director of such movies like ""Red Rock West"", and ""The Last Seduction"" was actually excited about this hideous work of filmmaking. My advise, if you like bad acting and no resolution, be my guest and watch... But for those of you who like plot, acting, and resolution, waste 8 dollars at the zoo..."
2,"Cliche, but with one BIG redeeming virtue.","Joy Ride begins with some of today's best young actors playing interesting characters in interesting situations. You're led to believe it will be a sort of ""buddy"" movie, as two slightly estranged brothers must take a car trip together, thus getting to know one another again. It then quickly becomes an exciting thriller with a fun B-movie sensibility.I'm a big fan of genre films and really enjoy a good B-movie. Joy Ride, however, ran out of ideas about half-way through the film. That made for a fairly boring, and downright annoying, last act.The movie has one HUGE redeeming virtue, however. Paul Walker has a surprisingly long scene where he is completely naked. Completely. Naked. Paul Walker. Completely. Steve Zahn is completely naked too. Naked. Completely. Those scenes alone make this worth the price of admission. Rumor has it that the nude scenes were added after the movie tested poorly. If so, then viva la focus group!"
1,3 Commentaries??,"After hearing about how great it was, I finally watched the DVD. Rusty Nail? Candy Cane? C'mon! This film is not a ""Modern Duel"", not even close! This movie is not Campy, Horror, or Funny. Seriously, what did those 2 Fools think would happen by playing a joke on an obviously strange Trucker? Did you think that guy sounded anything like a girl? Why install a CB? Would you buy a car just to pick a girl you already know well? A nude scene of the 2 guys?(Sorry fellas, Leelee remains fully clothed)And these people are supposed to be in college? All Unexplained. If you liked the film, the DVD is great looking & nice sounding, with alternative endings, and 3 yep, count'em 3 commentaries. Which I think is a shame, as much better Films have 1 or none.."
3,Joy Ride it to a Corn Field,"A movie that made me want to kill the brother from jail, and kill the writers for a terrible ending. The beginning is gruesome and looks like someone who maims for fun, but only falls apart with a broken down script. This is a movie that could have been. Drop the corn field, the ice man, and make an ending as terribly disturbing as the beginning. This movie should be remade to go to the heights of terror as the beginning. A three star/ 70 points out of 100 movie."
5,"""Hey, can you do a woman's voice?""","Hardcore horror and suspense fans really get a tasty treat of something different with JOY RIDE, and boy, we really needed it! It's about three kids; Louis and Fuller Thomas (Walker and Zahn) whom are brothers, and Venna (Sobieski), and we never learn her last name. Louis is driving across country to pick up Venna from Colorado, but then, before that, he decides to go to Salt Lake City, Utah, to bail Fuller out of jail. While driving, they fool around with other drivers through their CB radio. Fuller forces Louis into imitating a woman, and he says sexy things to a driver known as ""Rusty Nail."" They get Rusty Nail to come to a motel that night, thinking the woman is there. He ends up killing another man and the boys are thrown out of the state. Once on the road again, they encounter more trouble with Rusty Nail and things really get heavy when they get Venna.Definately see JOY RIDE if you want a tasty suspense film! Trust me, you'll love it!"
3,Entertaining But Not Perfect,"Joy Ride is an all right movie and gets your heart racing. In my opinion Duel, ( which this movie and many others have patterned after ) is still much better after being out 30 years. Also Road Rage is a better film of this genre as well. The acting is fairly decent and the plot is good up to the end. The end is unbelievable and corny. The culprit's plans turn out to be a big disappointment. Joy Ride IS worth your time, but some may find Duel a much better film about road furry."
4,FUN! FUN! FUN!,"Even if daddy takes the T-bird away, darn it! This movie is outrageously entertaining. I was in suspense, I wasn't sure who would live and who would die (anybody is game here), I've never been so impressed with Paul Walker's acting, Steven Zahn can play serious(!), and Leelee was really a good choice. I was a little nervous about her at first, but she made more than many actresses might have with her character....To get to brass tacks: the simple premise of a prank backfiring because the dupe turns out to be a psycho seems like it could be very unoriginal and thoroughly predictable. This movie was NOT. It was tightly directed for one, by gifted director John Dahl, well acted, tense and dark script, gorgeous cinematography (neon lights are just beautiful in this film), and a stunning climax! It's closer to five stars than four but I don't want people to think this is the next Psycho. It's not a brilliant film overall, but it IS brilliantly executed."
3,Waited for 2 months,"Believe me, I thought I would enjoy this movie better than what I actually did. I had been waiting for this movie to come out 2 months prior to the release date. It kinda reminded me of a ""Jason movie"". I hate movies that leave the ending open for a sequel(s). Not knowing who the killer is, is a killer. In all, the movie plot was pretty good, but very predictable."
5,Joy Riding is dangerous territory,"What a movie! If anyone wants suspense, this is the movie for you. Paul Walker is beautiful, too. That's another reason to escape life for 1 hour 50 minutes. Go see this roller-coaster ride of terror. You won't regret it."
3,Heralded as great..but....,"I had high hopes on this flick due to hoopla, even in this realm of reviews. But alas, i was a bit disappointed. Now don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad movie at all, just not the thriller I was hoping for. I gave it a 3 but it takes a lot to scare me, so judge for yourself:)"
3,Pretty Good...Could have been better,"This movie was good it just needed a bit more scary suspense scenes and a little bit more of a ""DEEPER"" plot so to speak. This movie is worth renting. And if you like ""Scary Movies"" I suggest renting it first and then making your own personal decision on whether to buy it or not after you watch it."
3,A grisly and fastly-paced thriller,"Reminiscent of Speilberg's telemovie DUEL; this horror film focuses on two young males who play a dirty trick on a seemingly ""innocent"" truck driver but only end up being his desired victims when their little joke turns sour. Stylishly photographed (Jeffery Jur) and creepier than one would expect with its expected fair share of grizzly moments. Although contains an abundance of noticeable plot holes (especially the ending), it still entertains without trying to be anything too special. Filmed in 2000. International title: ROAD KILL."
5,John Dahl is a genius,"Add Joy Ride to the list of must-see Dahl films. Like The Last Seduction and Red Rock West, Joy Ride takes quirky characters and sticks them into increasingly bizzare and dangerous circumstances. And this time around there's plenty of sction to boot. Walker is much better than he was in TFATF and Steve Zahn is as usual outstanding."
3,Be nice over the CB.,"Perfect show to see for my upcoming trip to SLC, Utah with my trailer in tow.Will watch show somewhere in the middle of Nevada at night!"
4,A Nice Little Chiller,"Joy Ride is a good scary movie. What makes the film scary is the lack of a monster, the villain is a real crazy guy who can easily find you.John Dahl makes the film suspenseful with it's dark tone and swift camera angles and the cast all play their roles effectively. I give it *** out of ****."
1,...,"This movie is about a prank gone bad, the prank is watching the movie. This movie makes no sense, how does this guy follow them around in that big truck without getting noticed. And the ending is so unbelievable. This movie is just bad, watch at ya own risk"
1,Copy Cat Killer,"I saw the movie Jeepers Creepers about a week ago. I liked it. I especially liked the truck chases. Anyway, I saw the preview for this movie and at first it looked cool, but then I realized that it looks like a poor take-off of Jeepers Creepers..I mean, the car chase?Where did they get that from? Hmmm... Maybe JEEPERS CREEPERS! Can't the writers of Joy Ride think of their own ideas? And, what about that lame thing the killer says ""You really should get that fixed!""""What fixed?""""Your back headlight!"" hahha how lame is that..It may have worked in Scream but I don't think it will work in this movie. My predictions for this movie is that the killer ends up to be some old guy that kills 10 people every 23 years, has a hook thingy he holds in his hand to slash people with, and wears a mask of some ""ghostly image"".. Oh yeah, and he probably wears a raincoat or hat when its not even raining! All I can say is, I'm waiting for this to come on T.V."
5,Superb movie - an outstanding masterpiece,"Joy Ride represents the metaphorial zenith what a thriller should deliver on a regular basis. Instead of providing the audience with overabundant gore and exceedingly outrageous cleavage and nudity, why not just tell a comprehensively sound story that amuses with ingenuity rather than excess. Charged with indulgenty clever shrewdress in its presentation, Joy Ride demonstrates acutely the rather sparkling joys of suspenseful storytelling that as of late continue to be ignored by a majority of the Hollywood establishment."
5,A SUSPENSEFUL MOVIE IN THE STYLE OF DUEL!!!!,"THIS IS A VERY IMPRESSIVE AND SUSPENSEFUL MOVIE. IT KEEPS YOU INTERESTED FROM THE GET-GO. I REALLY ENJOYED IT. I RECENTLY VIEWED DUEL FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IT WAS VERY GOOD ALSO. THIS MOVIE BORROWS A BIT FROM THAT FILM, BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT BUILDS IT'S OWN PLOT. IT'S A THRILLER AND AT TIMES IT MAY EVEN SPOOK YOU A BIT. ONE THING IS FOR SURE, I NEVER WANT TO ENCOUNTER A SITUATION LIKE THIS.SEE IT IF YOU HAVEN'T AND TURN THE LIGHTS DOWN LOW AND RELAX. LET THIS FILM TAKE YOU FOR A RIDE- A JOY RIDE!!!!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST THRILLERS THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!"
5,Help Me Live: 20 Things People With Cancer Want You to Know,"Couldn't believe how fast I received this book, just a day or two at most. This is an excellent book that everyone should read."
3,Not the best - not the worst,"Although a great concept, I found her writing style to be too simple. Still worth the read, easy to read and you can get a few good tips."
5,Help Me Live: 20 Things People with Cancer Want You to Know by Lori Hope,"Well written book with heart and soul. This is a very helpful book to all who read it. I feel this should be on the must read list. This has been so helpful to me and many others, I thank the author for sharing and taking the time and effort to create such a wonderful book. This is one everyone will want to pick up and read. I believe this reaches out to everone whether it is cancer or something else. The principles shared in this book will be usefull to all."
3,Contradictory,"I should preface my comments by saying that, though I have not lived with cancer, I have lived with cancer around me. Both my parents and one of my oldest friends (diagnosed at 35) died of cancer. I have been to numerous treatments with a non-Hodgkins cancer patient and with a terminally ill young mother suffering from breast cancer. While this book gives good insight, it has way too many contradictions. Hope admits this--that what is salve for one is like a knife for another. While it's shocking to read what some people will actually say, the people who would take the time to read this book aren't likely the ones who would say such things.Having been around entirely too much cancer since the age of 10, I would simply say, think before you speak, say it outloud to yourself before you put your foot in your mouth, and be there in whatever ways you can."
5,Workhorse mouse,"I got this mouse in 2007, and it finally ""passed away"" in mid 2012 when the left button stopped working reliably. All in all 5 years of use I consider pretty great for items like a mouse which are full of buttons that actuate over and over again.Ergonomics wise I got used to the Diamondback after a few weeks, however it's a very long and narrow mouse with broad top buttons and narrow, small side buttons. I'd advise getting your hands on one (applicable to this or any expensive mouse, really!) prior to buying if you can.In retrospect I would have been better suited with a shorter, broader mouse with more space for the last 3 fingers on the hand, but I still don't feel dissatisfied with the Diamondback at all."
2,Paid by the word?,"While I have enjoyed some of Ms. Perry's mysteries, this one, although well-plotted, had me grinding my teeth. The book is nearly 400 pages, but the story is closer to 200. Ms. Perry repeats ad nauseam the characters' thoughts and conversations, going over the same ground again and again. One wonders if she has no editor. Or perhaps she's being paid by the word."
2,Incredibly boring,"I was drawn to main characters of the series - all three of them are really charming. I also think Anne Perry has a gift to think up really interesting crimes and plot twists. But so far I only enjoyed two first books in the series. I hoped against hope, but the rest were boring, boring, boring. Constant repetitions and totally unnecessary conversations, it drags on and on. I hate wasting my time on that."
3,"good book, poor reader","As a long-time fan of Anne Perry, I decided to check out this one as a book-on-tape (after all, that's how I stumbled on my first Anne Perry novel, Pentecost Alley). That was a while back, and I am now reading the novel, because I finished the audio version with a bad taste in my mouth. I confess, it is a different experience to read a mystery when you already know the resolution. Basically, I am advising people to check out the book, but not the audio version. I was very disappointed with Mr. Jones' representation of Hester's character, among others; listening to him read, she came off as a whining shrew. My advice? Read the book, skip the book-on-tape."
2,"Tedious, overdrawn courtroom drama","I have admired and enjoyed Ms. Perry's style, plot development, and particularly her characters. ""Breach"" is not her best as it is unecessariliy prolonged and repetative; it almost says 'maybe you don't understand this. so we'll go over it again'. But she'll rebound, probably better than ever"
3,not bad ... but not her best one,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers - we were cheated of an ending somehow, but I didn't really mind that lots of things were left to my imagination. And let's be honest - did you really want the story to ramble on after these final words we all waited for? I have to agree though that Perry gets more and more of a women's lib writer in her books and I cought myself skipping these long monologues in favour of women's rights. We all are aware of that Ms Perry! And please, we all know that there are some pretty strange coincidences in life, but this one was a little too much...Certainly not her best book, but not the worst either - that was ""Brunswick Gardens"". I will keep buying her books anyway, I have grown too fond of the characters to stop now..."
2,Reader is cheated of an ending!!!!!,"I was very disappointed with the latest Perry book. She spends a great deal of time developing characters and plot, and for the first half of the book you have to wonder where it is she is trying to take the reader. Finally the plot starts to thicken and she takes you on a roller coaster ride through England. Then, just as fast as she gets your attention, she ends the book without a conclusion. I felt cheated and left hanging! It was almost as if she got tired of writing, or the last two chapters got lost in the mail??? She spends over 300 pages setting up a great murder/mystery and then poorly sums it up in less then 15 pages, leaving the reader wondering what happens to the murder and the other characters who are connected. I can't say I will be reading many more Perry books in the future if this is how they will end!"
2,most boring of monk books,"This plot of this book was totally unbelievable. The book could have been half the size if Ms Perry had put that downtrodden Victorian female soapbox away after a few uses. And how could Ms Perry,an English femme fatale, confuse Shelley and Keats?"
1,incredibly disappointing,"I have very much enjoyed the Anne Perry MONK novels until now. But I guessed the secret only a few pages in, and I found the plot twists incredibly problematic, and actually, misogynistic."
3,GREAT BOOK POORLY READ,"Simon Jones' reading was disappointing and irritating. It was choppy and brusk, nearly without any emotion or 'feeling'. His voices tended to be the same- nasal and abrupt for men, breathy for women, so it was difficult to tell the characters apart. His unfortunate treatment was very distracting for what is one of Ms Perry's best books and will discourage me from purchasing any more read by him. If you enjoy Anne Perry and wish to listen to her works on tape, I would recommend David McCallum's performances of her Pitt books- they are excellently done. Bottom line: read the book or try the unabridged by a different reader."
4,Dress for Success,"In this novel the Jane Austin predatoryworld of high class female society in the Victorian agetraps and railroads a man into a marriage he doesn't want.A woman and her daughter assume that he has consentedwhen he had no intension of being more than a family friendwho owed his living to the father's patronage of his architectural genius.I had just been reading ""The Hours""The Hoursand after that "" Mrs Dalloway""Mrs. Dalloway.The glib supposition of history is that Virginia Woolflike the woman of this novel was supposed to have committed suicide.Anne Perry as admittedly an English woman of literary geniushas another understanding/ solution of the case:it is another William Monk murder investigation."
4,Super book - what happened to the ending?,"I've read all of Anne Perry's books and consider her my favourite mystery author. I thoroughly enjoyed ""Breach of Promise"", even though the coincidence tying the plot and sub-plot together was a bit hard to swallow. I was disappointed, however, that the book ended so suddenly. I know that Anne Perry wraps up her books very quickly, but this one was a bit too abrupt! Nonetheless, it was very well done."
4,Twists and Turns Galore,"Twists, turns, and surprises make this one of her best. With a more vivid illustration of three very interesting characters-- including an illumination into the enigmatic Monk, readers will be treated to a divinely layered story with the smells, sights, and sounds identified with Anne Perry books.The only possible improvement could be a less-hurried finish with two of the major storylines still left open. Give us the fun of watching the self-righteous receive their dose and restoring the fallen!By the way, if you're interested in period mysteries-- be sure to check out Caleb Carr. Very hearty reading for a cold winter's night-- just remember to lock the door! :)"
5,Could not put it down,"This was a page turner from the start. It was Anne Perry, as usual, at her best. Don't be tempted to read the last few pages first, you will be very upset with yourself. Miss Perry has done her homework again and given us a look into Victorian life as noone else can. The best Monk since ""Face of a Stranger""."
5,Nine Lives Hits All the Bases,"The GOP convention is coming up in Manhattan. Wait until the delegates read this book. They'll quake in their boots. A terrorist homicide bomber strikes Grand Central Station, and all hell breaks loose. The bomber is called Felix the Cat, a cunning extremist and a failed screenwriter. His adversary is Denny Delaney, a New York detective fighting his own demons, alcoholism and an inability to connect with his wife Monny.This book is a grabber; it'll keep you up at night turning pages as Felix and Denny duel in a battle to the death through Felix's nine lives, his nine assaults in New York and Washington, D.C. Felix is fascinating, and Manhattan comes through as a character more than merely a setting. This is a page-turner, a great read. Don't miss it!"
2,With every page I turned...I died a little inside,"When a Middle Eastern terrorist bombs New York's Grand Central Station NYPD cop Denny Delaney must work fast to track down this evil doer. Problem is...he spends more time drinking and whining than doing his job. The bad guy keeps getting away with stuff and the cops seem like boobs. The story is poorly written and, I'm guessing, never edited. It is readily apparent when reading this tome that the author has a very high opinion of himself and a very poor opinion of his readers. Run! Run far away from this waste of good trees."
2,Lacking,"Yes, there is some good information and discussion in this book but for the price I would expect it to be more complete. For example, there is absoultely no mention of interactions between two categorical variables. I guess the authors ran out of steam. Also, the writing could have used some more refinement. I'd stick with Jaccard's volumes in the Sage Quantitative Applications series."
4,one-step guide to interaction effect,"A colleague recommanded this book, when I was struggling with multip-effect interaction. The book proved to be an apt and excellent choice for this kind of problem. There are several chapters detailing the interactions, unlike many other regression textbooks, which tend to skim over this subject. If the authors could be more succint in their writing, this book would have definitely deserved a 5-star."
4,Husband Christmas gift,I got this CD for my husband for Christmas. He really likes it. It is a great combo of music and lyrics.Will buy more of this group.
4,Bridge of Highs,Love all the Howlin Wolf lyric references and Robin Trower guitar leads.Check out Mighty High...In Drug City.
3,Not Their Best.....Not Their Worst,"I think few would argue that Blast Tyrant & Exodus are by far the Clutch's best. The song writing on this release is just not as strong. This one reminds me of Pure Rock Fury which also had weaker songs. It also has hints of Elephant Riders in that it is a very organic rock album but Elephant Riders in my opinion has much better songs. Beale Street has some great straight ahead playing and is rock solid but I was just hoping that Clutch would continue in the direction of their last two albums but take it further. In addition, lyrically the album is not as strong as it's Blast Tyrant or Exodus either. I will say that the mix is great and the album is rockin' but it just isn't their best. But even a so so Clutch album kills the other garbage that is out there."
4,Another Hit for Clutch,This is one of Clutch's best works. The songs have a lot of blues influence like you would typically find on Beale St. with a lot of hard rock guitar solos. AWESOME!
5,5 star band. 5 star album!,This is a great CD. I am enjoying this CD a lot. It's straight up Rock 'N Roll. Every song is jammin'.Thanks again Clutch! You never let me down!
3,A disappointment,"In the past Clutch has always stayed just far enough away from southern rock to not be lumped in with those bands. On this album they cross too far into that category and it becomes their most predictable sounding and bland album to date.If you are a first time listener to Clutch, skip this album and buy the self titled album 'Clutch', Elephant Riders, or Blast Tyrant. All three are far better than this."
3,Could have been better,"Every Clutch record has taken a while to grow on me, but this is the first one in the band's history that just never has. I don't mind that it's bluesy, I don't mind the keyboard player, I don't mind the Leslie cabs, I don't mind Neil singing bass, but I do mind the lack of compelling narrative and I definitely mind the inclusion of the ""One Eye Dollar"" remake in the track listing--there was nothing wrong with the original version and this one doesn't really add much to the album other than padding. A couple of tracks certainly do ""rock"" in the traditional sense, but the mish-mash of world religions, science fiction and citizen's band radio conversations that have always elevated paranoid convicts, truckers and fishermen to godhood in Clutch songs of old is spread a little too thin on this album for my taste. It certainly isn't bad, but it seems shallow in comparison. I guess I'm just one of those people who pays too much attention to the words."
2,Konami didn't try hard,"This game was bad, had no new story and the graphics remained the same. Enviornment still remains to be unfinished, lack of charecters and no new weapons. The list could go on but the bottom line is that the game sucks. 4/10."
3,Poor Silent Hill,"After Silent Hill 2, I was sure Silent Hill was one of the greatest game franchises ever. Then Silent Hill 3 came and it almost ruined it. Silent Hill 3 uses the same engine as Silent Hill 2, so it's not terrible but the story is total trash. That's pretty amazing since SH2 delieverd the most epic storyline in survival horror history. Silent Hill 3 is bad but it's still got a lot of what makes Silent Hill good. Silent Hill 4: The Room, is another story, that's when konami totally sold out the franchise."
4,Heather has just open a door way to Hell,Sillent hill is with out a doubt the scariest game ever made.Resident Evil is mostly just action and gore. This game isDisturbing and will scare the s**t out of you.The story is a little confusing. It got a little religouse to me than horror. The 2nd one was with out a doubt a doubt the most brilliant smartest survival horror game ever made.3 IS also brilliant and smart. The game is also kina depressing when heather finds her dad. The over all basis of this game is scary as hell. Im not very hyped up for the 4th one. The story seems kina crumy.So if you love survival horror game and arnt afraid to play it than buy this game now. You wont be dissapointed.
5,Great game. Don't let the controls scare you.,"This game ise a follow up of the first Silent Hill and it will answer MOST of the burning questions you have about the game. The story is great and features plenty of plot twists. As for the game itself... it's scary... play this in the dark if you're brave. You'll be making your way through som truely disturbing moments, things that you might only see in a nightmare of your own. It's that scary. The controls... people have alot of bad things to say about the controls, but honestly, they're a hell of alot better then Resident Evil's ever was. That's all you need to know right? Besides, the game isn't about pulling off fancy moves, it's about making you shake in a pool of your own fear sweat. And that's exactly what this game WILL do.If you don't get scared, and i'm being 100% serious about this, you should go see a docter or something, because you obviously are way to desensitized."
5,The best game to keep you playing,"I love this game ,its worth buying and to start a collection of the most scariest games ever. It will keep you glued to your seat and believe me you will get a chill, I love it"
5,Awesome Game,This game is amazing. The graphics and the suspence is enough to kee you going. Definatly recommend :)
2,Not Impressed,"Ha you fools all of you, you clowns!!!! HA HA HA! RESIDENT EVIL 4 is going to beat the pants of this piece of crap! HAHAHAHAHA!"
3,How can you review something you've never played?,"Man, the screenshots of this game look creepy. Too bad it doesn't look like anything relatively new. I mean, I'm giving this thing three stars, but I might be horribly off and it may deserve five stars, or only one. My point is, and I know this will fall on deaf ears, but why do people give things they've only seen pictures of a perfect score? YOU'VE NEVER EVEN PLAYED IT! HOW CAN YOU JUDGE IT?"
3,SH2 vs. SH3,"SH3 is too short. SH2 lasted about 13 hours for me, and SH3 lasted about 7 hours. But it was fun while it lasted.SH3's extra scenario is almost exactly like the normal scenario. Where in SH2 the extra scenario is different.So in my opinion, SH3 was just lazy game design.The monsters in SH3 are lame, NOT at all scary. In SH2 they were ACTULLY scary.Now, SH3 is actully fun. But compared to SH2, SH2 is much better."
2,"Compared to SH2, this is crud","This game is basically a just an add on to the first SH. While the second game had an amazing storyline with great plot twists, this has a plot so shallow it made me sick that I paid this much money for it. Waaaaaay too short. For the kind of money I put into it, I expected way more. Graphics and sound are great as ususal, but that just underlines the pathetic plot. Save your cash for SH 4, which I hear they are working on. But I'm renting 4 next time, instead of running out and buying. I learned my lesson with this dud."
4,One of the best Games,"Okay look if you want a game that lets you run around and shot stuff go run a search for Halo or something because Silent Hill isn't for you. The Silent Hill series takes brings a Hitchcock vibe to video games where the story is as intrigue as the graphics are beautiful (in a weird sort of way). Although I think Silent Hill 3 was a low point in the series, it was shorter then the proceeding games (I took five hours to beat- but a LONG five hours), and for me it wasn't as scary as the second or the first (which I still haven't beat- I think my game might be cursed or something ;). But on it's own Silent Hill 3 is a great game that provides a mild cerebral scary that many horror games can't match."
2,Over Hyped!!!,"Silent Hill 2 (SH2) is a classic. Silent Hill 3 (SH3), I just wasn't sure about. I bought it because I enjoyed Silent Hill 2. But after 40 min saw no reason for what I was doing. There very limited ammo so all you really do is run around trying to avoid unrealistic monsters. If you've played silent hill 2, you've been there and done that SH3 is a replica of SH2 with a little better graphics. Now if you enjoy running down hallways buy it or else to what I did, return it and get Fatal Frame 2 (FF2). If you like SH2 I would suggest getting FF2."
2,Oh my god...just shoot me already,Silent Hill 3: I'm not sure maybe it's just me...but This game sucks. I'm glad I just rented it and didn't waste my money buying it. When I was playing it felt like all my controls where ass backward. I gave it 2stars because of the soundtrack and graphics.
3,POP GOES THE FRANCISE!,"Okay, this did not kill the franchise, but it was trying to close it definately. It tried in vain to close any plot lines and stifle any sequels so that the developers could move to other projects. That said, this is the weaker game of the original trillogy. It is linier unlike the first two games (Okay, they were liniar too, but they felt larger, as you could litterally wander around a ruined town all day). This game was shorter too. The monsters were just as mind boggling, but one had the impression that they were running out of ideas, or at the least recycling old ideas anew.The Combat is tired, old, and stale. The enviroment is uninspired and smaller. The characters are not as involved. It just does not feel as good.But I liked the game. I like it better than the fourth game and onward. Is it perfect (Like the 2nd)? No. It's flawed. Is it good (Like the first)? Yes.Get it if you are a collector. If not, then don't bother. It adds closure to the first game, but only just."
5,An experience I will never forget.,This is a Brilliant game and one of the best games I have ever played. A master peace from start to end
2,Not my Cake.,"I loved Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 4, I didn't mind Silent Hill at all either but this one just seems like Konami was trying to get male fans and give them something they want - an ugly chick in a miniskirt going around in a dark grousome atmosphere and find it 'sexy'. I disliked this one for this reason. The gameplay I didn't enjoy either. So this one was out of me. I own the game and prefer the other 3, this one was the crappiest of the lot. Don't bother with it."
1,poor controls - too bad,"I'm not sure if I would have liked the game or not - the controls were so poorly implemented, that I quit the game after an hour of extreme frustration. I've been playing first-person and third-person games since Doom 1 days, using a PC. The basic mouse/keyboard control has long been perfected, but the game designers just don't get it. I routinely purchase a good made-for-pc first/third person game and _start off_ on the hardest level and enjoy the game immensely (Deus Ex I and II, all the unreal games, all the doom/hexen/heretic versions, all the Dark Forces/Jedi Knight series, Halo, etc, etc.) These games all have one thing in common: a GOOD adjustable interface. This game simply does not -- I tried various combinations/settings, but it's goofy indirect interface does not work for me. I just wish _someone_ had told me _before_ I WASTED $30 on it. I'll be adding KONAMI to my list of ""AVOID THESE"" ...."
3,Silent Hill 3,NEW SILENT HILL 3 BETTER THAN THE 1ST BETTER THAN THE 2 BETTER EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
1,STOP REVIEWING GAMES BEFORE THEY COME OUT!!!,"I gave it one star because all silent hill games that came out before deserved one star, and people are giving this game a good hype before it even comes out. (like they did with part 2, which was extremely boring by the way)"
5,So far very impressive,"I spent quite a lot of time online looking for a tent that would be a good balance between price and quality. After reading many reviews i stopped on this tent for the combination of brand known for its quality, size, weight, and of course price.As compact as it seems when folded, the tent is rather big. We were two people in it, and could easily fit in all our gear. My first camping with this tents was in Adirondack in late August. On the very first evening it rained and actually rather heavily during the night. The tent was dry and kept the warmth pretty well. I did by a tarp for it, to place underneath and i assume that helped.So far, i am happy with it!"
4,Much worth the price!,-Easy to assemble-Compact-Light weight-Easily portableThis is what you need for occasional camping and is undoubtedly worth $50.
3,small but simple,"nice for the rare summertime overnighter - a bit small, two people take up all the floor space as the edges tend to pull up off the ground; nice for 1-2 times a year or for the kids to camp out in the yard"
5,this tent's outstanding...,"my girlfriend and i have used this tent all over the state of Fl. although it's not like camping in ""the great northwest"" which is where i was raised, this tent is still very impressive for it's cost and efficency. we were caught in a ""gator gusher"" thunderstorm before one of the hurricanes hit central Fl. in 2005. it shook and swayed in gust's to 40mph but we never got so much as a single drop of rain inside."
3,Long Gone Hardscrabble,"As a faithful reader of Corey Ford's Lower Forty stories in Field and Stream in the late 50's, I wanted to like this book a lot. The problem is that the Hardscrabble of the 1950's doesn't transport well to today. Those lovable characters that I knew in an Upstate New York town much like Hardscrabble, are long gone. The hardware store has been replaced with a Gap and the general store that was filled with old curmudgeons is now a Starbucks populated with twenty-something latte drinkers. Ms. Morrow does an admirable job trying to resurrect the old place, but the lingering feeling that many readers will have is that old Hardscrabble is a faded photograph that is best left to the past and not ""colorized"" for the 21st Century. If you want the real Hardscrabble, read Corey Ford. Ms. Morrow is a good writer; she should apply her considerable talent to the word beyond Hardscrabble."
5,Jarre-Jar Binks stalks the Temporal Plane!,"In the very beginning, I bought my first CD by Mr. Jarre. 'Twas a live recording from his concert in Hong Kong 1994. I must say the music was indeed of me likin', particularly to mention the magnificent Chronologie themes!I found, however, myself more than a bit disturbed by that bloody applausing at every turn, not to mention the speaks in Chinese. ""Arrgghh!"" would be the proper description of me reaction, mayhaps.Thus I gathered what little monetary possessions I had set aside during the course of years and purchased the studio-made version. Now I am a happy fella indeed, thanks to Mr. Jarre!"
3,Not completely satisfied,"The songs are very Jarre-like. #4 Is the best track in my opinion maybe that says enough. The live in Hong Kong interpretations of songs like #2, #3, #4, #6 and #8 are far more great."
2,His Oley True Spirituael,"I just kinda found this albumb looking for spirituael music. I listened to maby 5 difrent albumbs of his and althou this one kinda reminds me of Transylvania Saterday Night Feaver, It is the onley one yet that can realey see true spirit in. It is well done spiritualey at that. All are good for comon relaxation though. If you seek spirituael music and are deep in it, this is the one reguarding this artest. You may also wana check out Kitaro, Enigma and Enya. hey are among the masters. All good."
3,Nice but ....,"This CD contains exceptional tracks (1, 4 and 6). Unfortunately, it contains some real bad ones. It is a pity that the celestial theme of the beginning of track 5 is not developed into alarger track. As a final comment, Chronologie 4 is quite nice!"
3,a little bit dry for reading,"this book was informative for sure but I found it to be a bit dry, I pretty much had to make myself finish reading the book, I would say it is informative without being interesting..."
4,Think like a Samurai,The book will help you get into the mind of the Samurai. Has an excellent description of an actual sepuku ceremony.
5,great toy!,"We ordered this toy as a birthday present for our son. He loves all the toys bruder makes and they are probably the best, most durable (3 year old boy proof) toys out there. They are realistic and fun. I recommend these toys and seller. Shipping was quick and it was here before the estimated date. Very satisfied"
3,one and one,"I got two of these, and I was very happy with one and a little disappointed with the other one. The bearings were covered on the first one, but exposed on the second one. Since I didn't have two caps for the tops of them when I installed them, I used the one cap I had plus a glob of grease to block dirt on the exposed bearings. Still, I thought that was pretty strange."
1,Cheap!,I recently purchased this shirt from Ultra force and was very disappointed. The material is so thin I can see right through without even holding near light. The lettering on the front isn't properly centered and is also thin and cheap. Obviously an inexpensive and unprofessional job of making a shirt. Do not buy from this company!
1,Don't Bother,"The movie is supposed to be a parody of the Italian cannibal jungle films ala Umberto Lenzi. It will probably amuse those who can't get a date and are stuck in their dorm, or cave but you'd be using your time more effectively if you counted out of town license plates in the mall parking lot."
5,scenes easily displayed in my mind,"Who would have known that the book, about young love, would have taken such a drastic turn? How sad for Dan to have to wait so many years for a new, tangible love to enter to his life.... but how inspiring in the way he found another. Scenes were easily displayed in my mind all throughout the book. I graduated a year ahead of Mr. Thomas in high school, and surmised, from cover to cover, which actual landmark, event or experience he drew from that perchance slipped onto his pages. I was able to easily identify with Dan, who thought he had everything his life needed, only to have his life change beyond his control. I must agree that it is refreshing to view life's disappointments and the path to rebirth from a male's point of view. I await his next novel."
2,spiderman valance,you can get a much better looking valance at wal-mart and u don't pay shipping or the wait and it cost less that would be my anwser also there is very little of spiderman shown on valance but not the one at walmart
3,Decent Effort,"The storyline was good, but it was very predictable and the characters were completely unlikeable...from the whiny, wimpy Julia to the arrogant Thomas to the diamond-in-the-rough Cal.Pick it up used or from the library. It's decent, but not worth the full cover price."
4,Buyer Alert !!!,On my copy of this DVD set the first DVD had the first and second episodes reversed. Make sure if you watch this that the episode identified as #2 is the one you watch first. Episode # 1 should begin with The Rector's wife doing some office work. Episode #2 begins with a sort of pastoral country village scene. The second DVD doesn't have any problem.
2,Great production but faulty product!,"Hello! I just want to alert everyone to the fact that as wonderful as this production of The Rector's Wife is, the dvd version of it has the scenes mixed up and it's difficult to navigate around to find the correct order! I know the book well, and would assume the televised version would certainly follow that order, whatever necessary alterations would have to be made to translate the print into the movie otherwise. I accidentally put this review on the seller's page, but it should have been placed on this product page. Apology to the sellers!"
2,Not so good,"Great acting all around but very weak and unrealistic storyline. I highly doubt that the intelligent woman portrayed by Duncan would risk everything by engaging in a sordid sexual liason with the brother of her husband's immediate superior. Come on! And I'm sure the Arch Deacon wouldn't so lightly brush off the knowledge of Anna's adulterous affair with his brother (which occured in his own house). As a clergyman he would surely condemn their actions and offer couseling to help get the family through this destructive episode. The real problem with this movie is precisely that it does not make any moral judgements. Anna's actions are protrayed as being totally pure and justified. The heavies are her overworked and depressed husband and the church ladies who are just trying to help (as church ladies do). In return, Anna gets to have sex with another man. This is moral relativism at its worst. Not worth a repeat viewing."
3,"Laudable effort, troubled concept","As a document of the alternative globalization movement, this CD/mini-book presents a well put-together statement of purpose.From a purely musical standpoint, it falters somewhat. The emphasis is rightly on third world artists -- but nearly all of them possess some level of first world cachet. Far more fascinating than performers already caught up in the western machinery would be an exploration of the talent that finance-driven globalization marginalizes -- the street musicians and subsistence entertainers.The thought, I'm convinced, was that bigger names like Lee Perry and Femi Kuti would draw needed attention to the cause. The miscalculation is the notion that selling westerners what amounts to a feel-good CD does anything for an anti-globalization movement.The essays contained in the costly packaging are the crucial part of this release...the CD is merely a nice value add-on with some enjoyable music -- some of which even tackles global issues."
2,A Middling Book by a Great Author,Babe Ruth was a great hitter. But he didn't connect with the ball everytime was was at bat.Farley Mowat is a great writer. Sadly not all his books are home runs. If you would like to read some of his best then try:-And No Birds Sang: The Farley Mowat Library-The Grey Seas Under: The Perilous Rescue Mission of a N.A. Salvage Tugor-The Boat Who Wouldn't FloatNot every book written by a great author is a good book - we all have our off days. But that should not stop you from reading his best work.
4,Enter the Spa world...,"The main reason I bought the book was for the detailed explainations on the Spa Therapies, Cuisine, glossary and most importantly the list of spas and their services. This book is better than most in the details of spa products and rituals. Only ""The Tropical Spa"" is better as it has lots of details on Balinese Spa products (and lots of big colorful pictures)"
3,Family history.,I was a little disappointed with this book. It was a partial reprint of another book that I purchased at the same time.
2,Doesn't do justice to the guitarist.,"I've seen BB King at Winterland, San Francisco; Paul Masson Vineyards in Saratoga; and at the Catalyst in Santa Cruz. He is a wonderful entertainer. However, this is a poor knock-off album. It sounds like someone recorded these songs separately off the radio."

4,Price was right,Kid was amazed with the smoke and I am satisfied. Thought it may be possible for more smoke production - maybe not. This was my first experience with smoke.
1,Who would wanna?,"Maybe some desperate man like Joan Sebastian would wanna get with an ugly girl like her, but I think she is absolutely nasty looking! Her voice has never been great, but it was better before. She struggled to hard to record this CD."
5,Graciela at her finest on 'Robame Un Beso',"This CD is perhaps Graciela's best album to date. The slow cumbias, ""Es Brujo El Amor,"" and ""Intacta,"" are excellent for dancing. ""Y Llore"" is a tango-flavored ballad that is sure to catch attention. Graciela has a teardrop in her throat when she sings ""Apuesto,"" a very emotional ballad about lost love and disillusionment. The only downside to this album is that it is only 29 minutes long. Listeners will surely wish that she had added a few more songs to it."
5,Graciela- The Queen Diva!!!!!!!!!!!,"Graciela has an overly EXTREMELY GORGEOUS BEAUTIFUL voice!!!!!! She is an angel!!!!!! I don't know what I would do if I didn't have her albums to listen to everyday! She was blessed with gorgeous looks, a gorgeous voice, and an incredible set of lungs-her voice is so powerful it blows me away- it's MAGNIFICENT-i am in awe of how she is able to sing so strongly, and yet it sounds SO EFFORTLESS, like she is just a songbird who soars through her music-i loved every song on Robame Un Beso-my favorites being ""Robame Un Beso"", ""Es Brujo El Amor"", ""El Ultimo Beso"", ""Ventarron"" ""Y Llore"", and ""Intacta"", and ""Apuesto."" I often compare the strength of Graciela's voice to Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, and its femininity to Selena's and Ana Cirre's voices. Graciela has the BEST voice in the world-i will buy every album she makes forever. I love you Graciela!!!!!!!! love, Jenny C"
1,A very forced voice.....,"The songs on this CD are not good. The song ""Robame un Beso"" sounds very, very forced. It seems like the artist was struggling alot to say that phrase on the song. All the other songs seem very unoriginal. It's not worth listening to!!!"
2,Getz phones it in,"After ""Getz/Gilberto"" the second best selling Jazz album of all time behind ""Kind of Blue"", the record companies were anxious for another golden egg.However this is one of the worst periods in Stan Getz life, the 70's. Personal problems, and he was locked in the the bitterest divorce case in history, went to the Supreme Court! Things added to his orange juice...Joao Gilberto also has a good reason to have a grudge against Getz but it doesn't show here, he is as mellow as usual. A trooper. His singing and guitar & Heloise hold the day, while Getz pretty much phones it in. What's good on this album comes from him.For better Getz, pick any other decade or his life. For some reason all of the Getz Columia recordings are really bass thin and harsh. This one is less so, but no exception.See my list for many better Getz recordings."
3,"Great Music, Horrible Production","I don't think the playing is as poor as others have claimed, but the production quality is just miserable. I can't believe that Columbia can't re-master this and at least take out the most obvious flaws in volume, ""muddy-ness,"" etc. I'd be happy to buy it again if it sounded better!"
4,Underrated,This also has been a favorite of mine for thirty years. There are flaws but also many gems. Getz may have been in a bad way but his solos flow perfectly with the music. Gilberto is a joy as always.
2,Didn't fit my vehicle!,"The trim piece was fine, it just didn't fit my application like it was supposed to. I had to do major trimming to make it fit. This was very disappointing. Problem is once you order it and get the car apart, you have to make it work. Good luck."
2,impossible costume!,"Don't buy this costume. It is definitely not worth the money. The skirt and blouse are ok but the hat is ridiculous! The rim has tubing in it to help it stand up but unfortunately it is that collapsible tubing that is used in childrens' toys and there is no way to straighten it out. The hat just stays twisted no matter what you do.Also the crown of the hat is very small.I actually had to cut the crown off to even slip the hat on my head.It is sized for small child.The hoop petticoat is also a joke. It is made with the same silly tubing for hoops.There is no way to unbend these hoops. Once out of the package they are crammed into to, they just stay twisted.If the cost was around $50 for the skirt and blouse, it would be ok but it is definitely not worth this big price tag since other items are not usable."
2,Yuck!,"Picked this book up as a trashy murder mystery to read over a weekend at the beach. Good thing my expectations weren't high. Seemed as if a few chapters were missing, leaving numerous loose ends - I'm assuming this is a ploy to encourage me to read the next in the series, but I'm really not that interested. The book was obviously written by a male - every woman coming in contact with Stone seems to remove her clothes and throw herself at him. Any author who uses the word ""randy"" multiple times in a novel should be suspect!"
1,Pathetic!!,"This has to be one of the worts books I've ever listened to! It was very poorly written, the 'hero' is a stereotypical macho lawyer/PI type who constantly has naked women throwing themselves at him (to whom he couldn't possibly say no)and the courtroom scene had me yelling ""objection!!"". It was read in a bored monotone, the Mexican characters sounded like Speedy Gonzales and Stone's Italian friend seemed to have a constant sinus cold. The female characters were all weak, whiny, and sex starved, or sex starved and deranged! The so-called mystery is never even solved! This is the first and only Stuart Woods book I will ever read or listen to. Thoroughly amazed he ever got published."
1,A Waste Of Time!,"This is a shallow, predictable book by an arrogant writer. Not convinced? Read the ""author's note"" on page 337 before you waste your money."
2,A major disappointment if you're a Stuart Woods' fan!,"This Stone Barrington thriller is as lackluster as they come. The plot has some potential for development into a decent storyline, however, Mr. Woods has become lackadaisical in creating interest in Stone and the other characters we have come to know and love. The unsettling ending just adds to the frustration of getting this far and feeling disappointed once again. Better luck next time, Stuart. You don't get my vote on this apathetic tale."
1,disappointing read,i have enjoyed all the other books that mr woods has wrote about stone barrington but this one was very disappointing. i fealt that he just threw alot of words together and didn't gave alot of thought about it. i am tired of arrington. she is a person that i can not like she got her man then she didn't want him anymore but she still wanted what he could gave her. i thought that dolce could have put life in his books for a long time to come instead he has her go crazy. what a shame.
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible","This was one of the worst books I have ever read. I kept reading because I thought it had to get better. I had read The Run and loved it. This one did not compare in any way. It had no beginning, end or middle. It just went on and on with sex thrown in for no reason. a complete waste of time."
4,Fantastic!,"I just started reading Stuart Woods,he's just an explosive writer! This Stone Barrington novel was great! It's a ""who done it"" and an ""are we really married?"" all rolled into one. This character (Stone)is what every woman wants in a man. He's smart, well dressed, has money, can solve problems and is even sexy. The ending of this book surprised me."
2,"Very Dissapointing Book, Lacks imagination","Stone Barrington is one of my favorite characters in the mystery book arena, so I was eagerly awaiting the publication of Stuart Woods new book L.A. Dead. I must say I was very dissapointed. This book lacks imagination and the usual flair they have. I was bored a great deal of the time, really up to the last third of the book, when the book finally got unboring. The first half of the book goes into the plot and getting Arrington ready for trial, and takes too long and is unnessary. Nothing else developes. Oh yes Stone's jilted fiancee is stalking him in L.A., but I didn't find that too entertaining. I would definately check this out at the library before spending $24.95 plus tax on it.I hope Stuart Woods uses more imagination in his next Stone Barrington book."
1,i havent recive the book,i havent recive the book can u please help me because the book was for my brother. i send the book to prision and i call and they said that there are no book in my brother property.
1,Who does the author think he is?,"I have read all of Stuart Woods' previous books -- and loved many of them; however, the latest ""Stone"" novel is the worst book I think I have ever read. It has a reasonable plot, but very shallow characterization, poorly written dialogue, and contrived situations to create conflict between Stone and his lady friends. The author does little to make you like the characters, even the main character. Sad to say, I know Mr. Woods can do better. (Note to author: What happened, Mr. Woods? I am very disappointed and may not continue to read your work. However, I doubt that you would care -- the little note from you at the end of the novel certainly puts your readers in their places.)"
2,Let down from the beginning.,"This is the third Woods novel I have read, and I thoroughly enjoyed the first two. LA Dead misses the mark badly. It is almost as if the author is too caught up in painting the Hollywood jet set that he forgot there is supposed to be at least some mystery and suspense. This novel has niether of these attributes. The characterizations are overdone. I cannot recall an appealing female in the plot. The ""non-ending"" is a perfect fit for this most imperfect novel."
1,Pretty bad....,"This is my fifth Stuart Woods book, and it was dreadful. His characters are horribly drawn, and don't even remotely resemble what they were in earlier books. The character of Arrington went from an interesting woman, to a horrible cliche of one. For a woman who supposedly respected her husband, I don't think there was one mention of ahh gee....my husband is dead. The other women were written very badly too, and Stone seems to have turned into a male version of a skank. Men can be sluts, and for someone who is supposed to have a measure of integrity, Stone seems to have lost his. The minor story in the book is the murder and mystery. It was treated as a sub plot to the horrible depiction of the characters.Don't buy this book. There are better and more realistic books about the movie industry out there."
3,Audio CD Review; Just 'OK',"This is the first Stone Barrington novel I've heard by Robert Lawrence; the others were read by Tony Roberts. So for those of us listening to audiobooks, we get to rate the story itself AND it's telling. I find the story to be just 'light reading', or what my book group calls beach trash; mindless, a little mystery, a little sex, a no-brainer. Other Stone Barrington stories have had more depth. Also, Robert Lawrence reads in a flat tone of voice without any real enthusiasm. He sounds as if he's reading a textbook. Tony Roberts reads with much more life.I recommend Joe Mantegna reading Robert B. Parker's ""Spenser"" novels, and Tony Roberts reading the Stone Barrington series."
5,LA Dead,"We now have read ALL of Stuart Woods books and this one is as good - or shall we say ""GREAT"" as all the others. Everyone of Stuarts books keep us wanting to read more and more. We are now waiting for his newest one of the Stone Barrington novels. We are having withdrawel symptoms. Hurry up - write faster, please. Your fans, Helga and Ray"
1,Not a brilliant audio or novel,"I listened to the Brilliance Audio edition of this book and was very annoyed by the special effects applied whenever the character speaking was on the telephone or on television. Not only were they jarring, but the volume level often dropped at those times, forcing me to rewind or miss something since I couldn't hear it properly.The novel itself is not very good, either, as other reviewers have noted. I've enjoyed others in the Stone Barrington series, but this one seemed an excuse just to hook Stone up with many women who were not his wife, talk about various wines, and not resolve any important points brought up in the plot. As usual in Stuart Woods' books, there were several continuity errors that should have been caught in the editing process. Maybe they were left in to distract from the overall weakness of the book."
1,A Real Disappointment,"I hated this book and only finished it because it was a murder mystery. I have never read any of Woods' books before, but this Stone Barrington comes off as an idiot. After marrying a woman with ties to the mob, he then loses all feeling for her when a former love, Arrington, is suspected of murdering her movie star husband and he must come to her aid. Lots of sleazy, one dimensional characters with no morals abound in this book. The book was flat, the character Stone unapealling, and the characters very poorly described or not at all as far as their physical appearance and background. I hate myself for even finishing it, I only did it to find out who committed the murder. And after being dragged this way and that a few times, it's really no surprise."
3,L.A. Dead potato chips for the brain...,"If you've read the other books concerning Stone Barrington you most likely will read this one simply to keep up with his latest antics. That way when the next escpade comes out you will be up-to-date. However I would caution anyone who picks up this book with the intent of finding a story deeply engrossing, mature or politically correct. I on the other hand like the occaisional frivolous, airy, fast-and-easy to read book. L.A. Dead fits those requirements. One thing I would like to express to Mr. Woods---Barrington's charm is the way he likes (and does)sleep with every female he comes in contact with, therefore don't ever let him get married again. And please, please, please get rid of Arrington for good."
4,Good Book,I did enjoy this book. I like reading a series in order but started with the sixth book. Anyway it was good enough to keep me reading the others.
3,More Of The Same,"For lovers of Woods and Barrington. The main thing I find annoying about the Stone Barrington series is that the books rely too much on one another. It is possible to pick them up randomly, but I don't recommend it. Woods is a master story teller and he has done a fine job fleshing out his characters, but if you are in for a penny, why not be in for a pound? Do yourself a favor and read the series as it was written. You'll be glad you did.BJ NeblettElysian Dreams: Where the Past Meets the Present"
3,STONE BARRINGTON ** BOOK SIX,"Stuart Woods gives us L.A.DEAD the sixthe installment of the Stone Barrigton stories. They should as with any series be rad in order. For me this one misses and is the worst of the first six. Stone cancels his wedding to Dolce torun to the rescue of Addington in California where she is accused of killing her super star, movie star husband. The plot is weak and the characters just plod along. Addington has been a good repeating character but not in this one. Will surely keep rerading the series but this book falls short. SERIES RECOMMENDED"
5,Best writer in North America today!,"Stuart woods has done it again: you want to get to the end to find out who did it, but yet the writing and the story are so good that you want it to go on forever. You can't put his books down, nor do you want to. L.A. Dead is terrific! Just when you begin to figure the plot out, he throws another twist in and it becomes even more spell-binding. His prose is terrific and there are few wasted words. He'll grab you on the first or second page and from there on, you can't put it down. Get this book now, even if you have to buy it in hardcover, like I did, breaking one of my cardinal rules about only buying paperback."
5,LA Dead,"I have read all the Stuart Woods novels, and I prefer his earlier ones such as ""Chiefs"", ""Run Before the Wind"", and ""Under the Lake"". For me, the Stone Barrington novels have been hit or miss. If the word ""dead"" has been in the title, the novels have been very good (""New York Dead"" and ""Dead in the Water""). ""L.A. Dead"" is one of the best of the Stone Barrington books. Stone goes to Italy to marry Dolce Bianchi, but before the religious ceremony takes place, Stone learns that his actor friend, Vance Calder has been murdered, and that the prime suspect is his wife, Arrington. Arrington is also one of Stone's former lovers, the only woman that Stone truly loves. He goes to California to help Arrington fight the murder charge, with the help of big-time lawyer, Marc Blumberg. Stuart Woods is one of the top suspense writers today, and ""L.A. Dead"" is one of his better efforts."
4,Brilliant,"What can I say Stuart Woods is a definite leader in novel writing community. I love reading Mr. Woods' novels and have never been disappointed. LA Dead was done in his usual elegant style. Stone Barrington is one of my personal heroes in the Woods' series of novels. LA Dead had me hooked from the beginning -- opening with a marriage and ending in the courtroom. This novel kept me wondering who did it, although some of you will say you had it figured out from the beginning but for those of you like myself yes I guessed but I was never sure until the end. Mr. Woods is definitely a master in this arena. If you're looking for an enjoyable reading experience checkout LA Dead and all of Stuart Woods' other novels because they are worth it."
1,Terrible customer support.,"The unit stopped working less than two weeks after I purchased it. It would be fine if RCA lived up to its warranty obligations and replaced the unit. However, they claim they have no units in stock and do not know when they will receive any. To add insult to injury, they will not contact me to let me know when they do arrive. I am supposed to call them once a week to find out the status of their stock. When I told their customer support representative that this was ridiculous he actually said ""too bad, it's our policy."" This has been the single worst experience I have ever had with a company.Unfortunately I cannot comment on the actual functioning of the unit since I do not have one that works and have no idea when and if I ever will."
2,More like Mary Silliman's Bore,"Granted I had to watch this movie for class and write a paper for it. I'm sure it's a good movie in its own right, but I didn't like it."
3,Helpful for those just getting started,"No one person can tell you all the tricks of getting into the Radio and Television business, but advise is necessary. As a college student, I found the book helpful and it led me to do my own in-depth research. This book really got the ball rolling for me. It should not be your career bible, but it is a helpful resource."
5,Good gloves,"reasonably priced work gloves, have an old pair I have had for quite a while, glad to find another pair."
4,A washable glove,"This is a nice washable glove that is comfortable for light work if this something that you have a use for, but don't keep you warm in very cold temps. Wares better than expected, but for the price it's good if you can get a good deal."
2,Way too small,I have two toy breeds and one has difficulty getting through the door. The small size may work well for cats but only the smallest dogs can use it.
3,"wrong color, missing parts",the door delivered was not satin and I needed to buy a few small parts to install the door. I needed the door immediateluy or I would have sent it back. I bought a second door at Lowes as it came in satin and with all the parts needed for installation
3,Functional for purpose intended,"My cat goes in and out as needed though is still somewhat leery of getting stuck. She has been using it for over a month and still needs some encouragement. What I would like to point out is that I have an insulated slider that has double paned glass. Due to the tracks and the thickness of the slider, the locking mechanism offered with the pet-panel does not line up. Therefore, to lock the slider, I just put a piece of wood in the track. Also, as others have mentioned - I needed to add more foam strips to close the vertical gap between the slider and panel. So, the pet-door is functional in that my cat will use it. The other issues have been solved in the ways I have mentioned. I am glad I bought it as it makes life easier for both my cat and myself."
4,"Door works well, in theory...","Ordered this (large - satin) for my 76lb mix. She has yes to figure out that she can push the flap to walk through it, but we are rating the door not the dog ;). I am sure she will catch on, till then we leave it taped open when we leave the house.Door installs well, clear instructions. The latch wont install on my existing door because it is beveled, thus putting the latch out of line. I'll make something custom.Solid built and the ""satin"" matches bare aluminum well. The magnetic flap seals ok for the moderate temperatures here."
2,Pass on this,If you can put a through the wall dog door than I would do that. This is just not a great product. The instructions are lacking. And with the many different types of sliding glass door this may or may not fit well on your door. For the price the materials are not up to par. The black rubber flap to keep out the draft stayed on for about 3 days. After than nothing would keep in stuck to the dog door. If you need something right away this is an ok stop gap but I would not buy it again.

She was Romilly who lived among the beasts of hill and forest and communicated with them, who tried humanity and turned it down for its evils and jealousies. She had the MacAran Gift, the rare laran that conferred mastery over hawk and horse.There was war in the lands of Darkover for this was the age of chaos when usurpers took the throne and the true king wandered in disguise with a price on his head. Romilly wanted none of all this, but there were those who shared her talents-the men and women of the Towers. And for them Romilly was the key.Whether male-garbed or beast-minded, she was also human. And duty to her own true kind pointed her to the ultimate decision."
2,"One great idea, several ok, and the rest filler again and again","I had heard a few really good things about this book. Unfortunately it was like watching the trailers for a mediocre movie on TV and then going to the movies - you know the rest, all the good stuff was seen in the 30 second preview.Being fair though, there is a point or two that makes a lot of sense - perhaps even an ah-ha moment. However, you'll get all you need out of this book in the first half. The second half of the book really disappoints in that we have the same items repeated over and over again. Did I say the second half of the book has the same items repeated over and over again?"
3,Thin on content,"The content is good - what there is of it. And there isn't much! Somewhat overpriced, I think. I only bought it because someone whose opinion I respect raved about it, and how much of a different applying the technique had made to his sales closes. I agree it's a very, very good technique.But the book's expensive for a single idea, said over & over."
4,"Well written, must read","I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to make a living, a life and a career in the art of selling."
1,Condescending and unrealistic,"I have been in insurance for 16 years now, and attended all kinds of sales training. The Wedge was easily the worst. It uses a ""perfect"" sales call as an example, and requires you to memorize a script. Unfortunately, no sales calls are perfect! The Wedge also assumes a naive and unsophisticated client who will not be patronized by your assumptions (i.e., ""so when the incumbent came in and did a claims review...""). Save your money and look elsewhere."
1,"Can you say, Get to the point?","Prior to boring the reader to death with mindless examples of common wrong headed sales experiences, it wastes nearly a hundred pages saying the same thing over and over. The reader is left begging the author to just get to the point, that being consider your competition as much as you do your prospect, then point out their deficiencies by asking questions.A good idea is so diluted and convoluted with the authors illusion of writing a sales classic, that few will make it to the end of this travesty."
3,Aging Well is helpful,"The most useful information I found was the four areas listed for seniors to follow in later life. The recommendations were based on several comprehensive studies which followed people throughout their lifetimes. I did find it odd that in the beginning the author completely overlooked work done by Abraham Maslow many years ago, and instead insisted that he (the author) had been the first to study healthy people. This, however, was a small thing overall and didn't take away from the relevance of the information."
1,"Aging well, Harvard Study",I never received this book and am glad you remind me of the fact I ordered it. Please let me know when I may expect it.
2,Liberal bias,"Given the usual tendancy of liberal academicians to deny their obvious bias against moderates and conservatives, it was refreshing to see Vaillant admit a few of his biases (and the biases of other liberals). He admits that, contrary to his expectations, conservatives do not age any worse than liberals. He had expected conservatives to age poorly because he thought that conservatives were not ""as loving"" as liberals--presumably because conservatives have some set of moral standards, whereas liberals do not have any such scruples. Vaillant also admits that social scientists have a tendency to display ""contempt"" for Christians.In general, Vaillant sets his own personal spiritual musings above any recognized religion, dismissing as ""immature"" anyone who expresses convictions regarding any and all traditional monotheistic religions--especially Christianity. Unfortunately, Vaillant is utterly unaware of how pompous and immature his own posturing appears."
4,Aging Well,I am only part way through the book ... but the book already is very helpful and insightful. I would recommend this book to others as this book was recommended to me.
5,Best nonfiction book I have read,"While one cannot take the author literally as to each item or recommendation (and the author probably does not expect you to), this insightful text has many great ideas for staying young and living a full rewarding life, regardless of your financial status.This should be required reading to pass 30 years of age!"
1,They didn't even use an original title,"Skip this one and go for the original AGING WELL by Dr. Jeanne Wei, which came out a couple of years before this..., which even uses a similar jacket design! AGING WELL by Jeanne Wei is much more comprehensive and practical than this new pretender, and I learned a lot more about how to manage my life to stay young."
5,Certain Times,"There are just certain times after midnight that nothing else will do but a Miles and Coltrane mixer. Like scotch and soda, gin and tonic, vodka and cranberry, these two just glide together. Put some ice in the glass, mix yourself a cocktail, sit back with a companion, or by your lonesome and let the chords and groove chase your early morning blues out the door! The only glaring bump in the buzz is that their wonderfully rendered ""My Funny Valentine"" is not on this compilation. This is nonetheless all good/BEK"
4,Good but inevitably omits too much,"The four stars is for the desirability of the record; the tracks deserve five stars without a doubt. In fairness to the music company, it must be said that the tracks chosen are NOT ""below par"", and they DO give an adequate impression of some of the best music performed by this extraordinary quintet. The trouble is, however, that anyone with any serious interest in Davis's music would, if buying just this record, soon want all of the CDs from which this selection has been taken. As usual, therefore, it is not really a good idea to buy a selection, but that argument applies with the more force in this case because Davis, Coltrane, and their group left us SO MUCH of significance. So my advice is NOT to buy this if you feel you may very well want to buy more CDs of this group, and even if you haven't yet made up your mind that you will, it is, I feel, best to keep your options open from the start. - ..."
5,Miles & Trane,"I am completely enjoying these artists. I am somewhat new to this music, but I find it very deep. You tune in on a different level with Miles Davis and John Coltrane. I was also amazed at Davis' productivity. Good purchase."
3,fun but difficult,Most of the games in this book are difficult for even me. The directions are not the clearest and sometimes I think you'd need more hands but over all the ones we are able to use are very fun!
4,complicated,"I love the cultural variety, photos and stories of these string games. If your child has already done string games, or is older, this would be terrific! I bought this for my 6 year old, who is both very bright and very well-coordinated with her hands, but these require so many steps and are complicated enough to be quite overwhelming for her. Don't buy this for a young child!"
5,A book that goes beyond test prep,"If you're looking for a quick way to pass the ExCET, this isn't the book for you. If you're willing to put in some time and really read, analyze, and discuss the passages in this book, then you may be on the right track. ""Becoming a Teaching in Texas"" isn't going to pass the ExCET for you, but it will give you an excellent structure in which to think about the way you've handled classroom situations in the past and the way you will teach in the future. I received this book as part of the $3000+ Project PACE program in Region One. This book was worth more than all of the workshops and Blackboard courses combined."
2,Copyright crazy,"Sometimes buying software is a crapshoot. I took a chance on this because it promised to let me extract ""clips"" from my movies. Well...anything (almost) out of Hollywood or rented from your local Blockbuster's etc. is copyright protected to the point that this suite is truly useless. I got the Mac version so maybe something for Windows willallow this to perform properly, although I doubt it. Save your money...this doesn't work worth a damn."
5,valuable addition,"Contemporary classical music is not the mainstay of my collection, so this is totally new music to me. CD is a valuable addition to my collection."
4,trying to get inside an abuser's head?,"I felt like this book was trying to understand what they could be thinking, why they are cruel and controlling and how to talk to them in a way they could possibly understand. The authors' previous books talk more directly to the woman, helping her to understand abuse, change her actions and give her a tool to confront the abuser (a written agreement). In contrast, this book talks more specifically about the deadly ways that the relationship works- the toxic interactions, the abuser's wrong thinking and unrealistic expectations and how the abuser's soul was damaged. It's not an easy book to read- it dragged up a lot of pain and anger relating both to ""how could he DO this? and ""why would someone do this to him as a child?"" But it was helpful on the recovery path."
3,Blah.,"Compared to her other book,The Verbally Abusive Relationship: How to recognize it and how to respondthis was insipid. I think some of what was covered in the prior book should be recovered since I did not understand what she was going over some of the time. I did get some help out of the book though and if you follow her recommendations to get somewhere with you man it will or might work if he has the ""qualifications"" recognizable for his changing."
4,The Verbally Abusive Man Can He Change?,"I recommend this to ANY woman who is having relationship issues not just those who are completely aware of verbal abuse. If you find after a few years in the relationship that you are no longer who you use to be, or you feel like your going crazy for no apparent reason... or have uneasiness whenever your significant other is around but you can't pinpoint why - there is no physical abuse going on... you just constantly feel like your walking on egg shells. it may be verbal abuse that is going on, and this is something that is hardly recognized by anyone, even trained counselors unless they are trained in verbal abuse."
5,The Verbally Abusive Man,This is the BEST BOOK on Verbal Abuse I have ever read. I learned SO much andhave my confidence back! Thanks Patricia Evans!
3,I didn't buy into the entire message . . .,"Although I found ""The Verbally Abusive Relationship"" highly useful in helping me understand the dynamics of an abusive relationship, I did not find this second book very useful. The item that was most difficult for me to accept was Patricia Evans' contention that the male's ""dream woman"" ideation drove his abusive behavior. Since much of what the author says centers on this ""dream woman"" concept, I had a hard time getting through the book. However, I am not a mental health professional, and I may simply not have the background needed to fully understand the author's thesis. Also, I have come out of the abuse situation described in this book, and the memories of the horrors may render me incapable of accepting such a lofty and theoretical description of the abusive male."
3,Worked well before it broke,"I have had this umbrella for maybe 2 years, but today it just all of a sudden stapped when I opened it. Now I live in Georgia so it really hasn't got much use over the last 2 years, so from my point of view I am not exactly sure how sturdy these are. I had used it the day before with no problems."
2,Beware expiration dates,"I have purchased this product in stores before, so I knew I would like it and decided to buy a case. Everything was as expected, but the ""Better if used before"" date on the case and the individual boxes was February of 2006. Now, I realize that these things don't go bad quickly, but I still think selling something THREE AND A HALF YEARS after the ""use by"" date is unacceptable. I will hesitate to purchase more food items from Amazon."
4,Are you in for a mega-crunch?,"Kashi means it when they say crunchy: these granola bars definitely pack a big crunch--but a little too hard though, I think. Don't get me wrong, they taste great--pumpkin seeds, flax grains, and pumpkin-pie spices are a great flavor blend. I just worry about chipping a tooth eating these; they're unusually hard to bite down on and chew. At least that makes them take some time to eat, which helps with portion/appetite control. Tough texture aside, the ingredients don't raise any obvious red flags (no HFCS, hydrogenated oils, etc), and there's nothing heat sensitive about them, so I'll definitely keep them in mind when I need a small snack for the road."
2,Don't kid yourself. It's a candy bar.,"These bars do taste great, but that's because they have a whole lot of sugar in them. Look at the label. The second listed (and thus second most predominant) ingredient is ""evaporated cane juice crystals,"" which is just a euphemism for sugar.I thought I was buying a healthy snack bar. Well, it maybe better than a Snickers Bar.... but not much.If you want a great tasting candy bar, buy it. But if you want something healthy, purchase another product."
3,Almost as hard as a rock,"These bars are so crunchy, I have to break them into pieces before biting into them.The pumpkin spice has enough sweetness to satisfy me and contains a good amount of protein and fiber, much more than the average granola bar sold at the supermarket. So far the only other snack bar that surpasses Kashi would be South Beach Living Cereal Bars with 10 grams of protein compared to the 6 grams in Kashi. The average protein being simply 2 grams. I have to add that although Kashi uses some of the most natural ingredients, their products don't contain many vitamins, if at all.So I'm probably going to stick with South Beach cereal bars. Plenty of vitamins, and yes it does have corn syrup and artificial flavors, but it tastes really good and won't chip a tooth. The Cinnamon Raisin flavor is better than the chocolate, It's like eating a cinnamon raisin bun, but much healthier. =)"
5,Toddler's Favorite,"I got this book for my older son who loves all sorts of animals. He quite enjoyed it but I was quite surprised when my little 18 month baby wanted to read it too. True, she loves birds. She loves to go down to the park close to our house and feed `duckies'. When there are birds in our backyard she'll point through the back window at them, until I look, saying all the while, `bir, bir'. Just a couple of days ago she took the book out of our little-person's book section, walked over to my wife, took the book that she was reading out of her hands and put ""Birdwatchers"" into her hands. She then crawled up the couch and sat herself down in my wife's lap, waiting for her to start reading the story. My son liked the last page of the book, but my little girl will look on each page for any little birds that are there. It is quite a good book for any bird loving child's library or adult too for that matter."
1,companies who market cat's claw INNER BARK take advantage of people's ignorance...,"....because the inner bark is not the part of the plant with the health benefits! It's only the ROOT that has medicinal properties significant enough to be actually have an effect on a human body. And the companies know this, but of course they can get the inner bark for much cheaper and then market it to people who don't know any better. Very unethical.Also, heed the alcohol content. Anything more than around 10% is excessive, serving no purpose other than diluting the product and creating a repulsive ""chemical"" taste."
4,Neiko caliper,"This is the first caliper I've ever bought. Compared to the other calipers in use in my engineering class, this caliper is easy to read, accurate, and sizable. It also comes with a replacement battery, a downright wonderful thing.The only downside I can perceive is the enormous force needed to move its jaws apart and together. The amount of force I have to put into tunrning the slider is worrisome; as the electronics assembly is constructed of plastic, I'm afraid I'll strip or torque the thing right off. In the instructions, you are directed to use a few drops of clock oil as needed to lubricate the sliding assembly, and I am now off to buy some.Overall, a well functioning machine, but I would want something better if it were for daily use."
1,Poor Quality Control,"I purchased this knowing full well that this value brand probably was going to be slightly inaccurate. I was fine with it being off by a couple of thousandths or so, but the product I got was terrible!The reading would fluctuate by over 2 tenths! TENTHS! It will read 1.8"" when it should've read over 2 inches. Even opening the caliper very slowly, the number would sometimes jump down by .3"" before returning to the correct value a few hundredths of an inch later. I'm going to try for a replacement. Hopefully the one I received was a fluke and if the replacement is better, I will change my review."
1,"Not heat treated, wears badly","I use this caliper for reverse designing of parts so it doesn't get used very much. I have 30+ years experience in manufacturing much of which was metal machining.I was measuring a part and the measurements using the inside surfaces seemed to be off approx. .007 inch. I calibrated the caliper and sure enough it was off that amount. Closely examining the measuring edges revealed that they were greatly worn. I have a Mitutoyo caliper that is 30 years old, was used daily for many years, and is still in fine working order. I'll order a Mitutoyo now to replace this one."
1,Just plain junk,"If the price looks too good to be true, there's a reason. This thing was off by several thousandths and could not even return to zero within a thou. This might be good for a hobbyist, but if you need to accurately measure anything, then do not bother. Best thing I can say about this contraption is that they cheerfully refunded my money."
1,Not as described,"I'm not happy with this. I bought it because the picture and some of the user reviews said it had a fractional inch mode.However, the one I got does not look like the one in the picture, does not have fractional inches and does not include the spare battery."
4,value,"As a machinist by trade, this caliper (along with its 8 inch counterpart which I also own)is not as completely accurate and dependable as I would have hoped, but it does seem to repeat and show true at least within a thousandth or two, which for the money I would say is completely reasonable. It's no mitutoyo by any stretch, but as long as you don't need to be any closer than a thousandth or two it will work just fine for you."
4,GREAT BUY,"This tool is a must for every Engineer and Handyman. I bought about 12 of these items to sell to customers and they all love it, not one (1) came back to complain of it and that's about 1 year now.GREAT PRODUCT for the PRICE.RAL T"
1,Disappointed,"After being urged by an associate to purchase this Neiko Digital Caliper, I purchased it and was anxious to put it to work. I brought it along on an important project during which I would be verifying dimensions on a large number of SKUs. It quickly became apparent that the readings were not consistent. Smaller dimensions came in OK, however, when I would go past about 7"" or so the accuracy seemed to disappear. This was very frustrating and I reverted to using my tape measure instead for nearly the entire project. At this point I consider the purchase of this product to have been a complete waste of time and money. The saying ""you get what you pay for"" has been proven correct in this instance."
3,"OK, not great","The caliper got loose in its case and knocked a chunk out of it, so that the bottom of the caliper was sticking out of the hole in the case. Display was blinking because the battery was already partly dead. Otherwise seems reasonably okay."
4,Good Caliper for the price,"I'm only using this to measure consumer products and I find that this meets my needs. However, if I was going to use this in a shop where it was going to get tossed around, I'd consider something with a little more strength to it."
2,Good to a point,Well the Caliper is great but you might as well buy your own batteries from the start. I got two Calipers and both came with two batteries each but none of them worked.
4,Better then Expected,"Received this caliper not sure what to expect. After testing it out was more then pleased with its accuracy. I loved the ability to swap between SAE and MM as some of the instructions that I have are giving measurements in Metric. I give it 4 stars, and for the price it definitely can't be beat."
2,Cheaply Made,"Purchased 6 of these as a trial for shop use. 2 were received defective and replaced without having to send defective ones back. Good thing because we have stripped the defective ones down to replace parts that keep breaking like the thumb wheel and end plate which the screws just randomly fall out of. On a good note the calipers measure accurately when run through calibration procedure. Outside jaws, inside jaws, depth and step all measure good. Too bad the calipers are made so cheaply. Will not ever buy again."
3,Works great except for the thumbscrew,"It's funny that all the fancy stuff on these calipers work great. I like the decimal fraction conversion etc. I just can't get the thumbscrew tight enough to really lock it on a specific width. Not really an issue for measuring, but if I am using it a compass or marking multiple pieces with it, the calipers will slip.Overall I am happy with the product."
1,Beware,"Based on the previous good reviews, it sounds like I got a lemon. My set of calipers sometimes loses its mind. The digital readout will start incrementing even without sliding the caliper jaws. If I leave the calipers on my bench, I sometimes come back and find that the readout has climbed to a ridiculously high number like 90"" (the calipers are obviously only 12"" long).If I pull the calipers out quickly it will lose count along the way. Full travel of the calipers should be 12.065"", but if I pull them open rapidly it only counts to 11"" or so.For me, these were a waste of $40. I tried to cheap out since my work isn't typically critical to more than .010"", but these are horrible. I bought a $125 economy set out of McMaster instead and they work great."
3,Ok for what it is.,"not a heavy duty caliper. Broke 1st time dropped, our mistake. Had to replace battery, yesterday 1/4/13, not long after it was put in service. Thought battery should have lasted longer. Granted, it is not an expensive caliper."
4,Blast Off into Color,"This is the first episode of the second season of the 1960s television show, Lost in Space, and it is also the first episode that was ever aired in color. It features the notorious Dr. Zachary Smith attempting to swindle the elixir of life from a prospector who is destroying the planet that the Robinsons are marooned on, from the inside out. As the title indicates, a ""blast off into space"" eventually ensues in this campy clasic which is a ""must have"" for any fan of the series."
3,King of California,"The King of California is a quirky, film with one of my favorite actors-Michael Douglas. He is just out of a mental hospital and already following clues to find a lost Mayan treasure trove of gold coins. His teenage daughter, who has been taking care of herself since he was put away, wants to believe him, but has a hard time with the whole lost treasure premise, and her father's random night wanderings and quirky behavior. But as she is pulled further and further into her father's psychosis, we are pulled in along with her. It is a silly, twisted story, but sweet and tender at the same time and I have to admit, has a very funny and bizarre ending. I think my twenty-year-old daughter enjoyed it more than I, so maybe that says something for the type of humor it portrays:)"
3,A Few Laughs...,"... and an adroit portrayal of a nut-case California libertarian dysfunctional father with a heart (or possibly a whole chest) of gold. If you've ever lived in California, especially southern, you're excused; you don't need to see it, you can just sit on a step-ladder in your patio and watch your neighbors. Otherwise, you might not feel too bad about wasting an hour-and-a-half on a film that aspires to be as wildly sardonic as a Coen Brothers movie, but ends up as sappy as Gidget.Oh yeah, the young woman, Evan Rachel, deserves another chance, in a stronger role. But please, don't cast her as a precocious seventeen-year-old again!"
4,NAKED CHINESE MEN,"Miranda (Evan Rachel Wood) had been raising herself for the past couple of years while her father (Michael Douglas) has been institutionalized. Now that her dad, who she calls Charlie is out, he becomes a disruptive part of her life. He has an idea of buried treasure and draws Miranda into his wild scheme.Miranda is torn between wanting to believe in her father and the reality that he is not all there. The movie has occasional flashbacks to Miranda's less than normal childhood. The film is a slow moving indie that is built upon the relationship and not the action.For those who like well acted quirky indies with a ukelele soundtrack, this one is well worth a view.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Some adult themes."
4,Really enjoyed this movie!,"This was thoroughly entertaining and a touching story. There were a few ""yeah right"" moments, but less than most movies. We loved the juxtaposition of strip malls and chain restaurants against Charlie's old house. I recommend this movie."
2,Could have been great,"This film has a good story line and a great leading actor. This could have been a great film were it not for the budget, direction and writing. This is such a low-budget film that I suspect it was filmed in one or two weeks at most. Many of the scenes are skimmed over and left to a voice over to explain all the missing scenes. Michael Douglas does a very good job in his role, but he is a professional, who has been performing for many years. The other characters needed more direction but did not get it. Very little time was spent developing characters or plot. I think the primary problem with this film is the budget. I don't think the director or writer had time to develop the film due to time constraints as the film has the feel of being rushed.This could still be a good film with the right personnel and budget but it will probably never be remade."
2,Don't Waste Your Precious Time,"There is just not much of anything to review here. Pretty much a pointless waste of time-sorta film. Michael Douglas acts slightly manic, in a crazier performance in the Wonder Boys mode, but most everyone else is hard to watch. There is not a compelling, exciting or interesting moment in this film. It's competantly made of course - but the script and the project are just sorta...needless.Save your precious time and watch something else."
1,Very disappointing!,"This is quite simply a dragged out dumb movie. I couldn't even stay with it long enough to see the end. After an hour of it, you simply don't care how it ends."
3,Fantasy,Charlie Sheen certainly shows just exactly what the imagination can do to lead us on a merry chase after the impossible dream. The film brings out the true feelings that many viewers may have in reagrds to following the rainbow to find the pot of gold.
1,Tres Jolie,The best thing about this movie was the original song written and performed by Jolie Holland. A snippet plays during the movie and then during the credits at the end.
5,A Tour de Force,"Mike Craver tells stories of the people and places of the North Carolina Piedmont where he grew up. Some of the songs are funny. Some are tender. Some are harrowing. All are masterpieces.This CD compares to Ian Tyson's ""Cowboyography"" in its masterly exploration of a single place and way of life, and to it, Tim O'Brien's ""Odd Man In"" and John Hartford's ""Aereo-Plain"" in its demonstration of the immense and varied talents of a single songwriter and performer. In each case, the artist, without regard to popularity or genre, has simply followed his own path in creating a CD that gives a peek inside the artist, and has done it with the utmost art and craft in both creation and performance.I've listened to this CD a lot, and I find something new to like every time."
3,"Cute, but not dishwasher safe","The characters are cute and the feel of these glasses in hand is excellent. Be warned, however, that they are not dishwasher safe. The decorations are stick on plastic decals and will come off in a dishwasher."
1,Misses the point,"I was extremely disappointed in finding that this book would not help my company. It misses the point of the indivisable nature of recruiting with retention. There is a lot of talk, and it seems to make sense on the surface, but there is no meat here."
1,A legalistic view of wine and the Bible,I found the book to not only be poorly researched but also poorly written.The book takes a very legalistic view of Christians that believe it is okay to drink a glass of wine or drink a beer. The Bible has as much to say about drunkeness as it does about gluttony but it is quite a leap to think that God views drinking a glass of wine the same as He does getting drunk. I have to side with John MacArthur when he says there will be more people in hell because of legalism than alcoholism and a Christian needs to decide what they will do with the issue of drinking and how it will impact their witness for Christ. P.S. For the young man that killed Crystal in that tragic accident...I am thankful you came to Christ.
2,not what i was hoping for,"i was hoping for a book that would provide me with evidence and examples from the bible that would help me to decide for myself where i stood on christianity and drinking, but instead i felt that this book was too biased and provided the opinions of the author without supporting them with biblical evidence or making me believe that the author was interpreting what God intended for us. I was very disappointed by this purchase."
2,Eye Liner,Very difficult to apply the color in a thin line. I ended up not using it and throwing it away.
2,It's alright,"It still smudges, but gives a good smokey eye look. Clinique no smudge worked better for me and is about same price."
1,"received as gift, going right back!","First, this ""18 inch feeder"" is actually 33 inches from top to bottom - waaaay to tall to fit in the space under the porch eaves where our current feeder hands. Second, the claim ""No screws to mess with"" - then how exactly do we open the battery doors? The one we received has 3 screws there, tiny, odd-sized screws no less. Third, ""Take out of the box, hang in your yard"" - ours came in 4 pieces, were we supposed to dangle them all from the hook or what?Getting the thing open to add seed is a headache - you have push, bend, slide then pull to get the lid open. Our current feeder you just slide the lid up the cable, pour in seed and slide the lid down.This thing is poorly designed from start to finish, and will be promptly returned from whence it came."
3,Quickly defeated by squirrels,Squirrels figured out pretty quickly that they can hang from the hook the feeder hangs on and grab the feeder to stop it from spinning. Clever b@$^@>ds!
5,Style and comfort,"I need to wear shoes with comfort and support and these definitely fit the bill--difference between these and other ""comfort shoe"" companies is these have alot of ""STYLE"""
3,totally stylish but NARROW,"I have a wide foot - size 8 - the WIDE size was still NARROW, so I needed to return it. If you don't have a wide foot - these are awesome boots."
5,Love these Boots,"The leather on these boots is very soft and there is no need to break them it, they are comfortable right out of the box. Love them!"
5,The best movie of all time?,"Whereas I know this may be a controversial claim to some (if not most) persons who read it, I consider this to be the best movie I have ever seen, bar none. Obviously, this, like all such preferences, is more subjective than not, but I do have my reasons. The historical sweep of this film is breathtaking, and encompasses some of the most important events which have ever happened in Asia, or in the world, for that matter. In addition, the acting is simply superb, without a missed moment, action or gesture throughout the whole of the film. The settings are striking, the costumes beautiful, the singing, though unsettling to Western ears, is haunting and resonates with the sadness and vigor of the story. Obviously, I could not recommend this movie more highly. I hope all who read this review enjoy this movie even half as much as I have; if so, you will still have had a satisfying evening in front of the small screen."
4,Provocative feast for the eyes,"This movie is a must see for sinophiles. It captures the joy and pain of a lifelong bond between two old friends, their rise to fame as Beijing Opera stars, and the questions and hardships that arise when love enters their lives. Set against the changing political landscape of 20th century China, this film offers an interesting cultural perspective on China's evolution from an artist's point of view, and what one had to do in order to survive. Provocative plotline including questions of homosexuality and righteousness of regime caused the film to be censored in China. A lengthy offering (almost three hours in duration), which also leaves some questions unanswered upon completion. Nevertheless a worthwhile and rewarding watch."
3,OVERLONG,"Some movies even though they're long managed to captivate, 'Gandhi', 'To Live' comes to mind...or even 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' This movie for all its intent and purpose did managed to convey to the audience the difference of what achievement meant during the mad chaos of the Mao years by juxtaposing the 'classically' trained and the 'I want everything now' of the China in the Cultural Revolution. The Chinese opera is just an example, one would shudder to think that this system was actually carried althroughout every profession in the Cultural Revolution China where untrained peasants were given the duties of performing complicated surgery. The drawback for me is that the film was OVERLONG."
1,The Ugliest Movie I've Ever Seen,"How this film won the hearts of Western film reviewers befuddles me. I suppose it must have been because it was the first big-budget Chinese film to hit these shores and all the film snobs wanted to ride the crest of the wave.It's utterly devoid of human feeling, other than anger, sadism, pedophilia and brutality. And the constant Mandarin shrieking is unbearable."
5,Almost Perfect,"The movie on DVD is the director's cut, which includes several scenes taken off for U.S. release. The film is certainly great, but the DVD cover design is beyond gay. It neither reflects the nature of the film nor shows any artistic planning; probably too cheap for a film that received Grand Prix in Cannes and an Oscar nomination."
4,No Pity Allowed,"The finger-cutting scene set the tone. The Chinese in the 1930's -1960's seem more inscrutable than Charley Chan. There seems to be no human emotion or pity allowed. The young boys training to be opera actors are beaten and savaged unmercifully. The boy forced to play a girl becomes a girl. His friend, apparently bisexual, marries a prostitute. Then a weird relationship between the three evolves behind stage. The Great Leap Forward destroys their art and their love. Cinematography is striking. I recommend."
1,Seldom do I turn off a movie before the end,"While I understand that the movie is supposed to be a symbolic depiction of loss of identity, I was utterly disgusted by its portrayal of pediphilia and violence against children. Moreover, the synopsis of the movie on the DVD box contained no warnings about this content. No surprise it won the Cannes porn-I mean movie-festival."
1,Farewell My Concubine,This movie was not enjoyable although it had been recommended. It's very depressing and hard to follow. The one good point of the movie was that it provided an interesting review of China's political history.
1,Nasty Movie,"After watching Croaching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, I was told that this movie would be liken to that and richer, but I can not get past the first scenes. The molestation and deconstruction of the childredn left me feeling dirty. I would not advise anyone to see this movie."
3,Eh,"I enjoyed this when I watched it, but it wasn't very memorable. Beautiful costumes, scenes, and watching society at a time of change."
3,A very lovely film...,"The film paints the story of two actors, from their first encounter at school in the Twenties through their success as stars of the Peking Opera, difficulties during the Japanese occupation, the Communist takeover in 1949 and the traumas of the Cultural Revolution in the Sixties...For the so-called Fifth Generation of Chinese filmmakers, the film touches new ground on two fronts... In the first place, though it does not avoid from acknowledging the sufferings under the old regime, it takes an embittered view of Communist society and of the Cultural Revolution specifically...The two friends, Xiaolou and Dieyi, adopt a young man, Xiao Si, who becomes one of the Red Guards and quickly informs the political sins of his benefactors...Second the film is a love story of a rare kind... Dieyi is a homosexual and suffers rejection when Xiaolou begins an affair with Juxian (Gong Li), a gorgeous prostitute... The personal conflict of each character is the heart of this exceptional movie..."
4,A legend lives on,"Wish that I existed in your world, so that I could at least comfort and share the pain that you had to go through. May god bless and guide you to the heavenly peaceful space, where you will be away from all the trouble that you wanted to get away from.Thank you for sharing your talent and bringing us the entertainment for the past two decades. While we all are carrying on through this difficult time, we will remember you. And your legacy will live on ..... Farewell Leslie"
5,Masterful Film,This is an incredibly a well crafted film not to mention the incredibly compelling story.
2,Good concept...,"This earpiece was a great idea, but the main issue with it is that it has no noise reduction, and that it begins to crackle too easily when my arm or body part gets in between it and the phone. Some may say that's normal, but NO--there are plenty Motorolas and Sony-Erricsons that have stronger connectivity that don't crackle as easy when obstructed, so don't buy into that line."
2,Not as good as the BT250V,"I bought this headset as a replacement for the Jabra BT250V and I'm somewhat disappointed. The fit isn't as nice, the connection between the power cable and headset feels fragile and is not a true USB connection (requires proprietary charging cable) and the headset no longer vibrates when the phone rings, which was a handy way of quickly locating the headset. All in all, its not as good as the BT250V for which I was very fond."
4,"Many good features, but short range","I purchased two of these headseats - one for myself and one for my husband. They are light weight and comfortable, and we are generally very pleased. Only two observations: the range is short - nowhere near the advertised range and more like 4 feet or less; and the on/off button is small and could be hard to use by men with large fingers. This device has great standby and talk time and reception is very clear."
3,I can't hear a thing!,"I have had my Jabra BT500 for three weeks and am already returning it to the company for a replacement. The speaker has stopped functioning. It went dead between two calls. It is still pairing with the phone, and the mic works, too, I just can't hear anything.The sound quality of the Jabra headset isn't as good as my wired headset, but for day to day use, it is far more convenient. Most people say they can hear me just fine, but at least two clients have mentioned that I sound like I am talking in a wind storm. Although the literature claims a range of 30 feet, it is more like 7 feet. The phone must,also, be kept on the some side of my body as the headset.I hope the new one works better."
5,By far the best I've tested!,"The BT500 is the most comfortable I've tested yet for long term wearing - even over their more expensive model. Since it sits in your ear instead of on the outside, you get better volume, clarity and less noise than others, even those costing more. Two other things set it apart: 1) its the easiest to stick on your ear with one hand when the phone rings, but you're not wearing it - important when you're driving!; and 2) the answer button is the easiest to activate, no mistakes. Highly recommended."
3,Jury is still out,"Originally bought two at the same time. One still works and the other stopped charging after 2-3 weeks. They were both gifts, and they were both loved immensely. So I bought a replacement. So this is the third. If two out of three are defective, we are moving on to something better."
3,Sounds like I'm in a tunnel...,"The number one complaint that I've heard from people while talking on the bluetooth with them is that I sound like I am in a tunnel-- lots of echos and exaggerated background noise.The device works well enough, but sometimes inconsistent in picking up a call-- I have to canstantly select ""audio source"" on my iPhone and select ""bluetooth"" rather than it picking up the call when I push the button directly on my bluetooth. Annoying. But what do I expect for $30?"
2,Jabra BT 500,"The sound is good and the controls are easy to use, but if the headset is out of range of the phone and loses the connection, you must go back in to the connection function of the phone to reconnect. My old headset would reconnect with the touch of one button on the headset. Due to the hassle to reconnect, I would not buy this headset again."
4,Jabra BT500 Bluetooth,I definitely like my new headset - and it works much better than the old one I had which was a totally different model. My only complaint is that the volume is just a little low event at it's highest adjustment. I mostly blame that though on my bad ears. I definitely recommend it though - was so easy to get set up on my pocket PC.
4,Beats the Motorola I had,"This headset fits so comfortably on my ear and I especially like that I can use either ear. I can hear so much better with the Jabra than the expensive Motorola headset I had that was always falling off my ear. In fact I was using the Motorola talking with my son, in a lot of pain and needing help. When I turned my head, it fell off and out of reach. My son called an ambulance when he could no longer hear me. My elderly Mom says she can hear me better on this headset too.Spring 2007 and this item stopped working. I'm irritated that it didn't last longer."
2,Newer is Not Improved,"I purchased this as an upgrade to my BT250; especially the ability to charge the unit in my car. While the charging feature is convenient and the button functions are slightly easier, where it counts (performance) the BT500 just isn't as good. It has a difficult time maintaining a good, clear, connection with my Mogul while I have no problems keeping same when using the BT250. It is, therefore, a disappointment."
3,Could be clearer,"Prior to buying this headset I used a Plantronics Discovery, which had great sound quality, but frequently lost the BT connection. This BT500 by Jabra is well-built and pairs easily but callers frequently say that the sound is muffled, especially when there is some background noise. I hear the other caller well with this unit and the clarity for the other party improves if I make an effort to speak clearly and at a normal conversational volume."
1,Horrible Sound!!!,"Bought a BT500 to go along with my Samsung i730. Used to love Jabra corded products but this is the last BT I'll buy from them. After straightening out a related software problem on the i730, I got the BT500 to activate voice dial, answer phone, and hang up, but I could barely understand what was being said. Can't call it 'static' per se, as it's a digital device, but it sounded like crinkling paper or something, and this is with the phone less than 3 feet away with clear line of sight! No rhyme or reason for it, didn't matter where I was or if I was moving, no wind blowing across the mic. Voice dialing was an adventure and it had great difficulty with digit dial, even once the phone was trained. Ended up returning it and getting a nXZEN Plus which is much better."
1,Voice dialing does not work,Voice dialing did not work on my T-Mobile SDA phone (Windows Mobile 5 device). This is absolutely unexceptable since I had a plantronics where voice dialing worked just fine. Will be returning it and finding a better brand.
2,Beware: not really a USB charging system,"The main reason I chose this unit was that it's hyped as USB compatible. Don't be mislead here: This does not use a USB mini charger like the Motorola Razr, instead it they give you a little adapter that fits into a USB computer plug. Therefore the unit cannot be charged unless you have one of their devices. I thought it made infinite sense to have a universal charger for headsets, cameras, palm pilots, cell phones etc. This is NOT what you get here.Otherwise it's a decent product. It replaces the bt250v that I've had for several months now. The 250v began to turn itself on and off and spontaneously. The sound quality is quite good, the charge is ample and it's a comfortable unit.I had considered this model and the Plantronics 510 from all the reading I'd done. I bought this unit over the Plantronics based solely on the promise of USB compatibility. So beware."
2,No significant improvements from BT250,"I bought it expecting it to be much better than the one I've had for almost two years now. Big disappointment. The static I used to get from the bt250 has not gone away especially when I have my phone in my left pocket of my pants and the headset on my right ear. Also, people tell me my voice sounds remote like I am in a room.This is not acceptable. I am going back to BestBuy to return it. Why pay $120 if there's no added value?!No doubt, it wraps around your ear very snug unlike the Motorola headsets but there's virtually no improvements compared to BT250.And let me guess - the next Jabra model would be BT500v for vibrate. I can tell you now - I ain't buying that one either.I guess it'll be a while before someone comes up with a headset that's not static-y but I'm willing to wait.Roumen."
2,Static at close distance renders the most comfortable headset a poor choice,"Well I have gone through a couple of bluetooth headsets recently. The Jabra BT500 was by far the most comfortable and easiest to place onto my ear. I could wear this headset all day and be very comfortable, as well as just throw it on in a jiffy for a quick call. It'd be ideal if the sound quality was even fair.But the static can't be ignored. I am wearing my phone at my hip and the static is terrible. This is how I mainly want to use the device. If I have the phone out and resting on my truck's center console, then the sound is much better. But in this situation the phone is probably less than 18"" from the earpiece.I really wish this set had worked out, because I love how it fits my ear in comfort and ease. I had another set that had great sound but I couldn't get it on my ear. Still looking for the perfect headset."
2,Solid headset at a reasonable price. But....,"Pros:I've had this unit for about a month and so far it's great. The volume is ample and the mic seems to pick up my voice clearly (at least no one on the other end is saying they cannot hear me). It is light-weight and the buttons are easy to find by touch. In combination with my LG Chocolate, voice dialing is a breeze.Con:The headset is a bit on the large side. I thought it would be smaller (my fault for not reading the specs closely). I was looking for a headset that would be completely hidden behind the ear.All in all, two-thumbs up for the BT500.Update May 2009Unfortunately, the headset only lasted as long as the warranty (90 days). It was great while it worked, but it should have lasted longer under normal use."
3,"Great Headset, but very weak build - broke after a month","Great headset, slim, light, nice design. girlfriend used it. clear voice.but after a month, it stopped charging. the end of the headset where the mic is located, cracked at the seam. she didn't man handle it so it must be the build.just a warning. great headset though.I ended up purchasing the Plantronics Discovery 640. she loves it. smaller profile, comes with a case and a load of accessories. case has mirror on back, which is great for a girl. but only had it for 2 days so far, so we'll see what happens. gluck."
2,"Worked OK, while it worked...","This headset worked very well under certain circumstances, like being inside a car or building. Outside, the microphone picked up too much wind noise, rendering it useless when holding a 2 way conversation. However, if listening to a conference call, it was easy to mute so that you could listen but not disturb the remainder of the call.Unfortunately it died when the charging plug was inserted backwards (it is a small plug which appears to be symmetrical, making it very easy to do). It should be forgiving enough to survive having the charging plug inserted upside down."
1,SUCKS....JUST LIKE THE BT250v AT LEAST FOR TREO!!,"I bought this item after giving the BT250v a try (twice) for my Treo 650. Please, Please, I implore you (unless you are completely deaf or love the sound of Rice Krispies in your ear)if you have a Treo 650 or any other phone for that matter dont buy JABRA. (SEE MY OTHER REVIEW ON THE BT250v)"
3,just ok,"not the best bluetooth i've own, i found that you must have the phone close to the bluetooth to work. if i went more that 5 feet from it, i get a lot of static. on the upside it is very comfortable. and because it stick in the ear, it is easy to hear the other party on the phone, as long as you dont stray too far from your phone."
3,It is okay,This product is great if you are by yourself. But once you are around people and other sounds that are loud. Then the person you are talking to can hear everything that is going on.B man
5,Wonderful product,"I got the JabraBT500 Bluetooth Headset because a friend recommended it. I am so glad I did. I've had other headsets and this one is by far superior. The clarity is great and because the ear piece fits snug in your ear you don't get so much background noise especially when you're driving, which is when I use mine most."
3,Good Unit. Would Benefit from Better Noise Cancellation,I like the Jabra 500 from a comfort and battery life perspective. It is easy to manage and does not cause ear strain like the over the ear models. It is tough to use in noisy environments. It would benefit from better noise cancellation capabilities and enhanced microphone pickup.
4,Skywalker's BT500 Review,"I use it with Treo 700wx...BT500 has worked from the getgo. Very simple to use, but read directions first & you be up & running in 60-90 seconds. I have only had to delete and re-pair it once since receiving it. Have had issues with lots of static on the very first call of the day, after that clarity is very good."
1,Bad,"The v250 is a much better set, the background noise on the bt500 is way too loud, I know longer have mine as I through it out driving down the road..... but I must say that the v250 works very good with hardly no background noise."
3,Okay but too flimsy and easily broken,"It worked great for a while, but with normal use it started falling apart. It also was useless in noisy cars unless you pressed it hard into your ear."
4,fairly okay!,"i bought this as a bday present for my bf and i think this headset just works ok! I found it a bit hard to listen to him when it gets kinda windy in the outdoor. Try not to get away from ur cell mobile too far, the noise will go up when the reception of the blue tooth device goes bad! But so far, he likes it :> I think the plantronics ones are cool too..but this one was on sale by the time i got it...hahaha"
2,Good and Bad,"Sound quality very good, fit and comfort very good. However, the signals between the phone and the headset (e.g., the ""voice dial"" beep) were inconsistent - sometimes there, other times not. After about a month, it wouldn't turn on. After recharging, it worked, but after trying to recharge again, it wouldn't charge, and it wouldn't turn on. Great response from Amazon to replace it. Hope the second one is better than the first."
4,"Great for me, so-so for those talking to me....","I love the way this earpiece sounds, it's very clear and it lasts for several days, even with constant use on my part. However, I've been told by those I talk to that it is VERY LOUD. I usually have to lower the volume on my phone. Also, I've been told that people can hear a LOT of background noise when I'm driving or when I'm outside. I guess the microphone is very sensitive.It is also very comfortable."
4,Quite happy with so far...,"I purchased this item as a replacement for a lost Motorola bluetooth headset for my Treo 650. As I lost my prior headset (and I am not a careless or disorganized person) I decided that a larger model might be a better idea. I have been quite happy with the sound quality and ability to hear, even when in an area with a lot of ambient noise. The multiple gel earpiece covers are a definite plus, as is the USB cable. Pairing the headset with the Treo worked fine. The only reason I am giving this 4 rather than 5 stars is that the style is a bit more functional than stylish."
3,High price for sub quality,"I bought the BT500 after a recommedation by CR. The head set was easy to pair. That was about the only nice feature. It kept dropping the signal, not while talking, on stand-by. There was no noise cancelling feature so it picked up all road noice. This made voice dialing very difficult.People I was talking to complained the back ground noise cause my voice to break up. The only way I could hear them was to apply pressure to the ear piece.When I wrote the company to ask for either a different size ear piece or a suggestion to help with the fit, I was told ""it only comes in one size and the only suggestion would be take it back to where I got it"". I did and purchased the Plantronics Voyager 510.I am very happy with this new headset."
1,Out of box failure,Would not charge either thru USB port or AC Adapter. Not worth effort to try to return through Amazon. Went to local retailer and purchased.
1,Poor design or manufacturing,"After three months, I have used the BT500 headset about three weeks. After less than two weeks, it stopped charging from the AC adaptor, and was returned to Jabra under their RMA. It came back 10 days later, but after another week or so it blew again, this time getting very hot and with that distinctive burned circuit board smell. I've not had a chance to let Jabra replace it again, and am tempted to just throw it away. Too bad, as the ergonomics are very good, the unit sits solidly but lightly over the ear, and the sounds was good when it worked."
2,Not too good,"It sounds great on my end, but people on the other end of the conversation kept asking me to disconnect it, because they could not hear what I was saying. So I gave it away. Not worth it. I bought on the advice of Consumer's Reports, but I can they can't always hit a home run."
4,first headset for dad (birthday gift),i'm getting used to it( the position on the ear)...talking with no hands great rating 3.5...it didn't hold in my ear far enough... I have to keep the sound up high or push it in sometimes to hear when talking. I like it with my phone(motorola razr)especially listening to my mp3 through the headset.
2,Slim but bad battery / charging plug!,"Nice slim design and fit. Battery lasts all day. Ear plugs fall off too easy. Wind noise not canceled out. Most importantly is that I've had two Jabra BT500s die on me, one in the first 2 months (my years old bt250v never died even after being run over by car and switch falling off, although the battery lasts just an hour or so now). It might be defective batteries, but I think it is a defective charging socket that easily allows you to plug in backwards (it will fry if u just start to plug it in backwards, not even all the way in). Be carefull to make sure the chrome side of plug goes matches the chrome side of socket (dont plug it in the dark before bed). Jabra will replace if you bought within one year from a dealer."
3,just ok for indoors,"This is my first earpiece for my cell. It was very easy to set up and it's easy to use. It's totally useless outdoors on a city street because I'm cut out for the listener if a bus or something passes me, but it's handy for indoors handsfree. People have mentioned hearing funny static when I use it indoors, and because I have small ears, the earphone doesnt completely sit in my ear well so I only hear things at a certain volume - but that's my anatomy. I am glad I only paid $25 for this."
1,Re-charge malfunction,"Initially, this unit worked very well and I found it to be extremely convenient. However, after only a week of use, it stopped accepting a charge. The unit comes with an AC adapter as well as a USB adapter. Neither would charge the headset. As a result, it no longer works. A week of use - you gotta be kidding! After researching this issue online, I learned that others have experienced this problem with the BT500 unit. I won't be buying another one."
3,very UNCOMFORTABLE!,"based on Consumer Reports, I bought 2 of these. BIG MISTAKE on the fit and comfort. They do work but so do many units out there that are easier on the ear."
1,Jabra BT500 Bluetooth Headset,"To heavy to wear, earpiece does not fit properly in the ear. So call can not be hear properly anless you put a presure in ear canal cousing it to hurt when wear for a long period of time."
1,jabra bt500,This is the worst earpiece I have ever had. It has to be kept too close to the phone and has too much noise in it. Waiting to return it.....
1,Unpredictable,"I am using this with a Treo 700P and it works about half the time. Sometimes you try to answer by tapping the button on the headset while it is ringing in you ear and it may or may not answer the call. So you end up just picking up the phone and holding it to your other ear and making you wonder why you bought this piece of junk. While it is working the sound is OK but it can't quite reach from your ear into your pants pocket, it will be too scratchy, so I have to put my phone in my shirt pocket or just hold it in my hand."
5,Worked great,Good connection. Good volume. Earpiece blocked out noise. Recharging was great. It was always ready.
1,Manager,On the plus side it fits well.It has 2 major negatives:1. It dose not signal when the connection is lost between the phone and headset.2. After dialing it is also necessary to press the answer/end button on the bluetooth to connect--should be automatic.
3,Jabra BT500 bluetooth Earpice,It links well with Razer phone but not as well with my Blackberry Pearl static if it doesn't have a clear path between them.
4,Good Headset,"Great bluetooth headset. Feels comfortable, sometimes can't tell it is even there. Good sound."
1,Jabra Bt 500,I purchased the item through Verizon. If you perspire it will short out the system. I went through 6 replacements in less than 2 months.I went back to the BT250V
2,Not Reliable,"I purchased this item, and it quit working after five days. I am now in the process of trying to get a refund. It's a comfortable unit to use, has both listening and speaking clarity, but completly quit working and won't recharge anymore."
1,defective product,Unfortunately this particular model which I think is the newest has a defect. The batery stops working so the earpiece can't be charged. I got a replacement and it did the same thing. I am much happier with the older 250 model.
2,Huh? What?,"People on the other end couldn't hear me well at all. What? Oh.I said people on the other end could not hear me.I would have to talk louder than normal. Yeah. LOUDER.And-nd they usually-ly said-d there there was an echo, Oh. Huh?This thing is hurting my ear. Lemme call you back."
1,dont get fooled,i bought this piece based on great consumer reports.however it tured out to be a great piece of junk. volume is too low u cant hear the person calling you and it takes forever to get it fit on ur ears.i stopped using it after 3 days
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad Product!","Horrible product. Very uncomfortable to wear -- irritated my ear like hell! The volume was bad; I couldn't ear people talk. I had to press it to my ear to even hear a word. I mean, what's the essence of a Bluetooth? Eventually, it packed up within days! I had a very bad experience with this stupid product. Also, the design was out of this world. I went to a restaurant, and some people looked at my ""Bluetooth"" and just laughed their heads off. Bad, ugly, and inferior ""product,"" don't waste your money on it!"
3,Great while it lasted.,I loved my Jabra BT500. This was my first wireless headset and found it lightweight and comfortable to use. It was easy to set up but occassionally my phone stopped seeing it. Not a big deal to correct. After 60 days it stopped charging and is now totally useless. The item was nearly $90 when I bought it and do not consider this a disposable item after such a short time. Of course returning it through Amazon is a new challenge and I've yet to figure out the system.
4,i love it,when i was looking for a bluetooth headset i was really looking for something that was priced right. i would have paid 3 times as much for this. it fits so comfy in my ear i forget i have it in at home until i hear it ring. i love the different ear buds it comes with! i would recomend this product and have.
3,Not the best tech. around,"BT500 has a spotty service realm. Gets interference from other wireless devices easily, airport, linksys, bluetooth. The mic has trouble working in a actual situations. Picks up noise from driving, air flow from the air conditioner blowing and ambient noise of TV/ radio. Needs to work in an extremely unrealistic envirn. making this an over priced headset.On the otherside their customer service/warranty is quite good as a result. They would take returns or exchanges for defective units. Which brought them up to 3 stars instead of two."
4,Best BlueTooth Headset,The Jabra BT500 seems to pickup some background noise but it is so much easier to listen to and does not create any feedback screeching for the person on the receiving end. I used to use a Motorola H500.JABRA BT500
3,Disappointing,"The JABRA BT500 is a good product, but is somewhat disappointing. There is no way that you can wonder more than 10 feet from the phone when using the earpiece. 10 meters would lead to a disconnect certainly. My BT500 connection has an annoying static when I put the phone in the right pocket and the earpiece on the left ear. That's frustrating. Because I haven't used other products, I still like the bluetooth technology, and wouldn't give it up, but the JABRA BT500 doesn't give me the freedom I expected to receive when I purchased it. I'm disappointed."
1,"Great design, very flawed device","When it works, the BT500 does the job as well or better than all the others I've tried. However, the ""stops accepting a charge"" problem is real and makes this unit totally unacceptable. How can Jabra put such a piece of junk on the market??"
3,Not bad...,"PROs: sleek design, easy connection, good mic, lightweight, long chargeCONs: volume low, fragileOverall not a bad product, but would not pay more than $35 for it."
1,Great for user...not so much if you are on the other end of the call,"My BF has one of these (unfortunately I purchased it as a gift for him). He loves it. He can hear callers clearly, says it fits much better than the BT250 and is so light he often forgets he is wearing it.However, my experience on the other end of the calls is much different. It sounds as if he has me on a speaker phone and the phone is half way across the room. There is a lot of static and it picks up background noises better than his voice.I'm giving it 1 star only because, apparently, if you are the one using it then it works great. Oh and I can't give it 0. :-)By the way, he has a Motorola Razr so I'm not sure if it is the phone / headset combo, BT version incompatibility or maybe just a bad headset."
5,iphone 4s incompatible?,"I love this headset, but I tried for the first time today to pair it with my new iPhone 4S and the iPhone responded that the Jabra BT-500 was an unsupported device. Can anyone else confirm? I though that bluetooth 4.0 (as is on the iPhone 4S) was supposed to be backward compatible...Update: Yes, it is compatible. I called Jabra and they gave me a procedure to reset the headset and it worked. It paired immediately after the reset."
1,General topics treated poorly,"Upon trying the first routine on scripts, and as a beginning AutoCAD customizer, I can tell you the author's attempts at conveying his subject matter were much less than first rate. Most of the 'free' customizing resources I have used so far were more clear and much more beneficial than this book. Please look elsewhere for in-depth information. A few topics are treated with some depth but, taken as a whole, it really is not worth your hard-earned money!"
2,A Solution without a problem,"for the same $, get a laptop- with XP you can use Remote Desktop to control another XP PC. For about 1/2 the cost, get an Ipaq with 802.11b, and use terminal services for the same thing.In either case, you get a device that can run on it's own, so your other PC doesn't have to be on all the time. This is just a ""dumb terminal"" with color graphics and a touch screen. cut the price by 75%, and you might have something worthwhile."
3,vs:ap:v150,Well just on what i have read i think that alonger battery charge is in order. As for the size I might as well just carry a lap-top around with me.That might be more effective. Other than that is is a pretty neat little item.
3,Why is it so heavy?,"To be honest, I don't own one, but I played with them quite a bit at CES In January. I know that everybody that has one and likes it says not to compare it to a laptop or a Tablet PC, but here's my question: Why do they have to be so heavy? The 15-incher seemed tons heavier than a Compaq Tablet PC to me, and the 10"" one seemed somewhat heavier, too. Why would a device that has no hdd, much less RAM, a simpler display, no digitizer, and a much lesser processor not be much lighter than a Tablet? It seems to take away the whole reason for having a mobile display for your stationary desktop. The ones that I played with at CES were quite uncomfortable to hold before very long, I can't imagine carrying one around the house. I think that the concept is amazing, it just doesn't seem ergonomically implemented."
2,Why not a Tablet PC?!? Or even a cheap laptop?,"Although this seems like a cool idea, why would I spend over $1,000 for a wireless monitor and stylis when I could get a cheap laptop for less money? If you really want the functionality of a tablet, Tablet PC's w/ Windows XP tablet edition do not cost much more than this device."
4,The best thing yet,"This back pack is fantastic. I just love it. I can carry her around with my hands free as she enjoys the world around her. sometimes she even falls asleep so I know she must be comfortable. She enjoys the closeness and warmth as do I but it takes the stress off my arms. I see that in some of the reviews some moms complain about the top flap covering the baby's face, but you can fold it down easily. I wanted a good quality sling but didn't want to pay 90$ for that expensive one. I saved 25$-30$ and I believe I got a sling that is just as nice as the Bjorn sling."
5,What it was really like to live on the frontier,"It was excellent to read the reiniscences of frontier settlers in their own words. The recounting of the Sioux uprising was especially interesting since it was the testimony of people actually living through the main battles of that war (from the settlers side, which is not always given these days.) The format is one of episodic narrative, so it cannot have a consistent plot or tone, but ""hearing"" the stories of the settlers, often with similar anecdotes, gives us a good view into their lives. Who knew that a shortage of brooms on the frontier would be a major issue for so many of the frontier women?"
5,Out of the mouth's of Minnesota Pioneers,"This is an amazing book! I found a 1914 copy of this book, in very fragil condition, and wanted to share it with everyone. It is thrilling to find that it has been reprinted! Anyone who really wants to know what it was like to be a pioneer in the 1800's needs to read this book. I purchased 2 copies, one to share with the Long Lake Pioneer Museum and one to share with friends. Thank you Daughter's of the Revolution for interviewing the remaining pioneer's in 1914 and preserving history as seen from the source."
5,love it,Excellent way of remembering those hard to remember things. They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Very effect approach.

5,"not no getz, but as good as joao gilberto!","If you've never heard Carlos Lyra sing, you MUST get this.He is a great, and underappreciated, singer....in the mold of Astrud G.and Joao. It's too bad we don't have more of his recordings from the sixties available in the U.S.This is a fine recording, one of the classics of Bossa Nova. Sergio Mendes is here too. Paul Winter is good. Some put him down, but I believe he is a musician that benefits from repeated listenings to hear his subtle shadings and coolness. He is the ultimate cool alto along with Desmond in my book. And we all know that ""cool"" packs more emotion than so-called ""hot"" jazz....via the law of the Tao Te Ching....more is less, etc.Highly recommended for smooth, sweet singing and playing. Great rhythm section too!"

2,seat cover,seat cover fit was excellent. Only problem was that two of the loops that help hold the cover in place were torn.
3,a bit dissapointed,expected a bit more attention to detail from this company - i will not buy this product over the internet again
5,A little of everything...,"I REALLY like this CD. It has a huge variety of music which includes ballads, soft rock and standards. I love the fact that Celine Dion packs her CDs with 14+ songs. It's a fun listen!"
5,The best Pop record so far!,"Celine Dion is one of the best female vocalists around, and she justifies this still with this fabulous new release. ""A New Day Has Come,"" which has been climbing the billboard charts, is a very beautiful melody about her newfound motherhood. The same theme applies to songs like ""Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)"" or ""Prayer,"" which is a tribute to children, like Michael Jackson continually does. There are also uptempo numbers, my personal favorites are ""Right In Front Of You,"" and ""Rain, Tax (It's Inevitable)."" The rendition of ""At Last,"" originally performed by Etta James, is a beautiful ballad, as is the rendition of ""Nature Boy,"" which remained in my head long after the record left my CD player. No one shall regret purchasing this album, because it's worth every penny."
5,From Celine's BIGGEST Fan,"When I heard that Celine was putting out a new CD I nearly lost it!! And when I heard her new song for the first time I was in love and counting down until the days it came out. When I got it I was so not dissapointed like some said I might be. ""A New Day has Come"" is of course great but I love ""I'm Alive"" and ""Right in Front of You"". Anyone, not just fans will love this CD. Celine Dion has had a huge impact on my life. Her music got me and some family members though some pretty hard times. When she annoucnced that she was taking a break to have and raise a family I was supportive but scared that what many said about her nevr coming back was true. Now I am counting the days until I can go see her in Vegas and laugh at those who doubted. Celine is back and better than ever! This CD is proof of that!!"
5,CELINE'S BIG RETURN,"After a two-year break.Celine finally returned.In this album,we can easily feel the whole new sense of life. The music carries messages of love and hope. A kind of healing power it conveys, which help those people in the low tide of life regain their strength angain. It's for sure a very good album to buy."
5,"I've waited a long time for the one album to change my life,","and this is certainly it. I purchased this in 2003 on a trip to Canada. I had absolutely no idea what to expect... more love ballads? Any catchy songs? When I scanned the disc under a previewer, I heard the fist single, ""A New Day Has Come"". I felt like I had heard the most beautiful, intoxicating, inspirational song in the world. It's been over two years, and I still feel as strongly about this album as I did when I purchased it. ""A New Day Has Come"" (both the song and the album) have changed my life in more ways than one. This album is the most inspirational art I've ever had the pleasure to listen to. The album, in its entirety, is amazing. I only hope that Celine Dion continues to make music as amazing as the songs in this collectoin."
4,The Queen Is Back!,"Celine's much-heralded return comes with this album, A NEW DAY HAS COME. It's a slightly different sound than we're used to from our diva, more upbeat, but still not forsaking the powerful ballads that we all know and love. Here are my faves, starting from the top...I SurrenderAun Existe AmorAt LastA New Day Has Come (radio version)GoodbyeI'm AliveRight In Front Of YouGreatest RewardPrayerSorry For LoveWhen The Wrong One Loves You RightThat said, there were songs like ""Rain, Tax"" and ""Ten Days"" that I personally skip over on the album. The album version of ANDHC is nice, but I prefer the radio version.All in all, a marvelous comeback. Though not exactly a ""classic"" album in the vein of COLOUR OF MY LOVE and FALLING INTO YOU, I still recommend it to all fans of Celine."
4,Excellent album,This is an excellent album. She is a very good singer. Here are some good songs. My favorite Celine Dion album is Falling Into You. I recommend it.Buy ! Buy ! Buy!
2,not much has changed,"Celine Dion while being away for a while not much overall has changed.fairly safe Middle of the Road Song Structure&Production.Her take on Nat King Cole's ""Natural Boy"" isn't that bad but it's not on Par with Nat King Cole's.but She has stayed within what She does Best.She is a Decent Vocalist but She still hasn't found Material to Really Give Her Voice Any Edge.and I guess that is as good as it gets."
5,A New Day Has Come album review,I am a true Celine Dion fan. This is the best mix of music Celine has recorded since Falling Into You and of course Lets Talk About Love. I bought 2 cd's. One for the car and one for around the house. I love it!!!!!!!!...
5,What A Gorgeous Voice!,"Celine Dion has a spectacular voice and has never sounded as good as she does on this CD. Her voice soars, dips and glides without stumbling and this true fan is glad that she is back!"
3,"Safe, not Special","Celine plays it safe on this album, singing songs that won't alienate her current fans, but not quite managing to find songs that will bring her newer ones. A handful of songs (including the title track) mention or allude to maternal love, which, combined with Celine's usual theme of romantic love, creates an oddly unbalanced album.Unlike her past albums, there aren't several singles that scream for massive radio airplay. In fact, the album's finest moment is a cover version of the 1940's crooner, ""At Last."" The album will undoubtedly be a big hit, but that's due more to a superstar's return than the album's merit.If you're a die-hard Dion fan, pick up the album; if not, don't bother."
5,Great,"A great album, and you can't go wrong with Celine. Lot's of good songs, I have most of her records, love them."
2,audio and vidio,Is this dvd to be video as well as audio??The one I recieved is a audio only Is this correct
5,Just Brilliant,"This is my first Celine album. I have always had a few of her singles that I would hear on the radio and so I decided to buy two of her cd's, falling into you was the other.A new Day has come has such great music on it, I did not know what to expect but I find myself playing this album on a regular basis since my first listen a few weeks ago. I don't think I even have a favorite track on the album. I never skip tracks. If I had to list favorites I would end up listing the entire album.The upbeat dance tracks include: When the wrong one loves you right, sorry for love, Rain taxThe serious power balads include: The greatest reward, I surrender, Have you ever been in loveVery soft and dreamy balads: Nature boy, At last, Goodbyes.........., The prayerMid tempo tracksL I'm Alive, Ten days, right in front of you and A new day has come.All i nall this is a brilliant album and Celine's voice is one of the Greats."
5,Awesome cd!,"Celine's done it again! I'll start off with what I'd rate it!I'm Alive- 4/5 Good tune, lyrics...Right In Front Of You- 5/5 One of the best songs ever!Have You Ever Been In Love- 4/5 Pretty good song, good lyrics.Rain, Tax (It's Inevitable)3/5- not my fav....A New Day Has Come (Remix) -5/5 Awesome song!Ten Days- 3/5 ok song..Goodbye's The Saddest Word- 5/5 nice sweet, song...great songPrayer- 4/5 pretty goodI Surrender- 5/5 love it!!At last 5/5- love this song...one of my favs!..good lyricsSorry For Love 5/5- good song...Aun Existe Armor 3/5- dont really understand it. like the song in french betterThe Greatest Reward- 5/5 plain out beautiful..one of the bestWhen the wrong one loves you right 3/5- ok....A new day has come- 5/5..do i like this version or the remix better? i dont know..they both are really goodNature Boy- 2/5- dont really like this one...not really sensible5/5 because love most of the songs! will always be one of my fav by her."
1,A New Day Has Come,"I have always liked Celine. I think she has a great voice, but she never seems to know what kind of cd to put together. All of her cd`s have a mix of songs. A New Day has 2 great old standards ""At Last"" and ""Nature Boy"", why can`t she put songs like that on one cd? ""Colour Of My Love"" is a good cd, it could have been great if it wasn`t for 4 fast songs. She rips your heart out with a great ballard and then only to be followed by a fast song and takes you out of the mood.I'm sorry, I am very disappointed in ""A New Day"" and may think twice about buying her next cd without hearing it first."
2,pleae take back this day....,"I rejoiced when Celine Dion finally decided to call it quits with the music industry. Then....one blurry day, Celine comes back with ""A New Day has come""...., which has has to be the most horrible, lyricless, melodicless, annoying album I have ever heard. Sure, I liked a few of Celine's songs way back in the early 90's, but there is only so much a person can take. Please Celine leave! Go back to Canada and sing for them, if we didn't have your name on the charts, maybe we could have a decent AMERICAN singer on the Billboard rather than you. Sorry if this review sounds cruel, but it's my opinion. All the songs are really horrible on this album. I just gave it 2 stars because you actually still managed to sell as many albums as you did with that displeasant voice."
2,POP Diva?,"Honesly I have always respected Celines' music she has a wonderful voice and can come up with some really good songs. But when you get to a point in your career that you no longer give as much as you should, it is a good thing to retire.With this release we can now see a POP version of Celine. I guess thats why she is often compared to untalented singers like Britney and Christina. Maybe if Celine retires it will be better for her current diva status. Id hate to hate her make a fool of herself."
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing material, I have to skip about every other song to hear something that isn't overly ""ELECTRONIC"". It's like Cher meets the Mormom Tabernacle Choir, and it doesn't Work!!"
1,where are the bad reviews????,"This album is a disappointment. The first two songs were ""ok"" and upbeat...something which is unexpected from Celine Dion, but they just don't affect me in any way. It feels like there's nothing behind them, almost like she did this album against her will and didn't want to sing the songs.I've listened to this album many...many...times, but with the same result. Boredom and disinterest. The only song that grabs hold of me (somewhat) is the title track."
4,Its a grower,Right i am a massssive fan of Celines and it took me a while to 'get' this album. But once i'd acepted the newer mellowed sound of her music it was alright.Shes alot more chilled and relaxed on this album. not so many vocal acrobatics and its actually really nice to hear her stripped back as it were.The songs arnt exactly striking except for a new day has come (amazing) but they do grow on you and ive had it for 3 yrs now and havnt got bored yet.Just skip 'sorry for love' GOD! how embarrassing it clearly should have been a contender for the eurovision song contest with its awful euro trashy pop sound.
3,"Celine is no Streisand, but the CD is okay.","I really like the music that backs Celine up. The music is actually what enhances Mrs. Dion's singing, overall. A good comeback CD; and she can even sing Spanish extremely well, like a native."
5,Is one of the best,I think this albun is simply great for Celine is definitely a diva.She was retiret for a couple of years and through this marvelous up_tempo CD she proves she's still one of the most talented all over the world.For this reasons a think A NEW DAY HAS COME is one of the best albun of the years
3,Voice of Celine The Mama,"Celine is back as a mother. That explains the transformation of the music tone compared with the previous ones. Though I feel the album average, I can still enjoy her brilliant voice. Dull impression of the album mainly comes from either the way the tracks are arranged or track orders that array similarly styled songs. If each track is singled out, however, it shines. Recommended for wide range of female vocal featured music fans. So don't easily write it off just because it is copy-protected or not-rockin'. Listen to the messages from warm and relaxed Celine the Mama."
5,The Warmth Of Motherhood,"Celine has always impressed me with her voice. But with her latest, it even impresses me even more. You can hear her cry and laughter. The difference since her ""Let's Talk About Love"" album. She's happier, fulfilled. It is truly an album that will take your breath away. Listen to ""I'm Alive"", ""Have You Ever Been In Love?"" ""A New Day Has Come"", Goodbye"" and ""At Last"""
5,Celine Dion Is Still Tops,"Celine's new CD ""A New Day Has Come"" is just great! The album has a wonderful fresh flavor about it after her 2 year absence from the music scene. I found all the songs to be very uplifting and vibrant. There is an excellent variety of styles exhibited and the album shows off Celine's wonderful talent. She is just as good or better than she was before she took time off to be a MOM. I could sense a real personalness in each song. Thanks Celine."
4,Sent as Gift,"Sent to my Mom for her B.day, she wanted some Celine Dion music to listen to around the house. She liked it."
2,Love the old Celine Dion music,"Do not like this kind of music, way too loud & yelling the music rather than singing. Good for younger generation!"
4,Still that great passionate voice,"Celine still has that incredible voice and passion in this return CD. The tracks are polished, which is not always a good thing. The beat is a bit disco on some; I might say ""commercial"", if that word means to you what it means to me.But her rendition of the standard ""At Last"" makes up for it. In fact, if the rest of the CD were horrible, which it is not, this one track would make the purchase worthwhile. Don't believe the critics. Give it a listen. Also endearing are the pictures of her new baby. She has arranged her schedule for Mommy time. Good for her!"
3,FIRST LISTEN - NOT BAD/NOT GOOD,"I BROUGHT THIS ALBUM TODAY, I OWN ALL OF CELINES WORK, ITS VERY DIFFERENT FROM HER PREVIOUS OFFERINGS WITH A COUPLE OF GOOD SONGS, THE STANDOUT TRACKS ARE - RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU, I SURRENDER, A NEW DAY HAS COME, SORRY FOR LOVE (THIS IS REALLY DIFFERENT) AND TEN DAYS. THE REST ARE AVERAGE."
3,A New Average has come,"Not her best but good enough to get by with ..., prayer, my favorite is a beatiful song just as many on her CD, all for the exception of one, Ten Days. This song just doesn't belong in this CD. Otherwise all is well."
3,Not her best,"I liked all of her albums up til ""Let's Talk About Love."" ""A New Day Has Come"" was a good single but it wasn't GREAT like the rest of her hits. ""I'm Alive"" is what it is--a good average song. Don't get me wrong they're not bad songs...they're just average. The only real standout is ""Sorry For Love."" She sounds AMAZING on that song and I think it should have been a single. It showed a new direction for her. I also think ""Nature Boy"" is a wierd song. ""Have You Ever Been In Love"" is another highlight. Overall I only really liked several songs which is bad compared to her other albums where I liked nearly all of the songs. C"
1,WHAT?,"I HAVE TO SAY THAT HER REMAKE OF ETTA JAMES' SONG ""AT LAST"" IS A JOKE. NOBODY CAN TOUCH THAT SONG OR COME CLOSE TO IT. ETTA HAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL VOICE WHICH MAKES THAT SONG BEAUTIFUL. MY FIANCE AND I ARE USING ETTA'S VERSION AS OUR FIRST DANCE SONG AT OUR WEDDING. AND EVERY TIME I HEAR CELINE'S VERSION, IT MAKES ME MAD BECAUSE SHE NEARLY RUINED IT FOR US. PLUS HER VOICE IS ANNOYING FOR THE SONG AND CELINE'S VERSION DRAGGED ON IT SEEMED LIKE FOR FOREVER...I'D BE EMBARASSED TO LIKE CELINE'S VERSION, I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO NOBODY!"
5,Celine Dion Is Still Tops,"Celine's new CD A New Day Has Come is just great! It has a wonderful fresh flavor about it after her 2 year absence from the music scene. I found all the songs to be very uplifting and vibrant. There is an excellent variety of styles exhibited and the album shows off Celine's wonderful talent. She is just as good or better than she was before she took time off to be a MOM. I could sense a real personalness about this album, it is written and delivered in each song."
5,Celine at her BEST!,"I was hesitant at first to purchase Celine Dion's new album after her time off. However, I broke down a few weeks later and was happily surprised that I loved every song on this album. Celine expands her horizons - it is Celine at her BEST! She has what it takes. I listen to the CD over and over."
2,not good could do better.,there are only a few good songs on this cd. will not play many times.muy mal or asi asi in spanish.graciasron
4,A New Day for Celine,"I like this album. Its shows that Celine is not all ballads when it comes to singing. I think this shows a different side of her. If you're looking to buy this album, give it a good listen before purchasing.Celine puts another good album out there just like always..."
5,Welcome Back Celine!!,"This is a true gem sung by a super talent.Motherhood hasn't had any detrimental effect on her voice.A true must own for Celine fans, and great music for anyone else."
2,Too Many Filler Songs,"This is one of the albums you will be ashamed of having when your friends point it out in your music collection. I think she should have been more particular with the songs included. It is about quality, not quantity of songs! There are just too many ""filler."" What is an album without a good break up or I am glad it is over song? (See The Corrs - ""I Never Loved You Anyway"")I am glad the Grammy graciously overlooked her talents in this album. You can almost classify this album under ""opera"" because she is really singing dialog! I would think Hector Berlioz is more enjoyable than this?! Don't get me wrong, she has a great voice, but her pitch is too high, way too high. Some of the songs seem to be just ""loud"" - with very weak melodies."
3,Dissapointed,This lady has a great voice. The problem with the disc is it'sjust too much of the same thing - It gets too SAPPY! On past discs she has recorded great tunes - not all but a few great ones.Same goes for A NEW DAY HAS COME - starts off fine but it's as if she is on repeat. I can't listen to the whole cd from start to finish.
5,AT LAST!,"Ever since I saw Celine sing ""At Last"" on the Oprah Winfrey Show, I knew I had to buy this CD. Her voice seems more mature and earthy, since having her baby. It's a wonderful collection of different types of song, but stays true to the ""Celine"" sound. I can't play it enough!"
5,A Wonderful Return,"""A New Day Has Come"" is a celebration of life, love and commitment to family. Celine's voice, if this is even possible, sounds better than ever. She is relaxed, confident and beautifully restrained. The album opens with the inspirational ""I'm Alive"" and hits perfect notes throughout, right up to her spare and haunting cover of ""Nature Boy"". Highlights include the title track (both in the radio remix version and the absolutely gorgeous and moving ballad version), ""Right In Front of You"", ""The Greatest Reward"", ""When The Wrong One Loves You Right"" and ""Ten Days"". ""Have You Ever Been In Love"" utilizies Celine's underutilized lower register and it provides for a sound we've never really heard from her before. The whole album feels like a maturing of Celine as a person and an artist. It was worth the wait. Welcome back, Celine, your fans have missed you!"
5,A NEW DAY HAS COME,"Celine sounds as strong as ever. A little more mellow since alot of her songs on this, I believe, relate to becoming a mother. The two versions of the title song are beautiful."
2,"Again.....no five stars for you, Celine!!!!","The CD is uninteresting. Not one of the songs makes me want to hear it again (save the title track, which is why the album gets two stars instead of one). I tire of hearing her sing vague love songs. At least with her last couple albums the voice and the accompanying music made up for the poor lyrics. Her singing on this album is almost as believable and just as bad as her singing reggae with Brownstone on ""Treat Her Like a Lady"" from a prior album. I always listen to that song when I want a good laugh. Very disappointed. Again, my strong recommendation is to listen to it...really LISTEN to it before you buy it..."
3,Hit and miss,"I heard the title track on the radio. I was so taken with the song I rushed out and snatched it up.Most of this CD, however, is utter rubbish. Sure, there are a couple decent songs such as 'Ten Days' and 'Nature Boy' but the song 'Rain, Tax, etc.' is like a cancer on this otherwise mediocre (but passable) CD. The remainder of the songs are fair but not interesting after one or two plays.Save your money. If it's available, I'd recommend buying the single."
3,"Different, but good enough",I gotta say for one thing Celine has a great voice. This album is different to her other stuff but is still good. The albume provides good quality songs and 2 excellent ones( A NEW DAY HAS COME AND RAIN TAX). The only let downs are Nature boy the french song and the mix of an new day has come. All in all a must have for any Celine fan. In short: reinvented
3,Celine at her best with more energetic pop and less ballads,When Celine first came out she was too boring with an overkill of ballads that were sometimes annoying not to mention that terrible duet she did with that other famale singer that sounded like they were constantly trying to out do each other like some kind of fierce competition. Well thank goodness she decided to try something differenct with this album. I hope she stays this way for our sanity and love for decent talent. I still skip half of this album and would really like to see her make a cd with no ballads at all and just danceable music!
1,Scareem Dion Strikes Again,"My husband has this CD. I wouldn't have wasted a penny on it. He likes the current crop of scream artists (Dion, Carey, etc.). Dion simply screams her way through yet another CD. None of the songs are memorable; they all sound alike. Save your money and your ears. If you've wasted the cash, use the CD as a frisbee."
2,Only three good songs,"There are only three good songs on this C.D.! Don't get it, it is a waste of money."
1,Lots of meaningless noise,"I listed to the album many more times. This album remains insipid. And the new song I'm Alive on the radio now is chock full of nothing...no lyrical hooks, no emotional depth. Whatever happened to the days when she would sing beautiful songs like ""Water from the Moon"" and ""With This Tear""? sigh. Also, what is it with music like Celine Dion's bringing tears to people's eyes? It's called emotional instability people. Cure: therapy. My suggestion....buy the Indigo Girls new album. Amy and Emily Rock!"
2,Celine returns lacking the right melodies,"A good Celine CD has melodies that give you a certain feeling when you listen to them. Her great voice paired with an enhancing melodie can be a great listening experience. Unfortunately, i get none of these feelings from this cd. Sure there are some hits here but most of the songs are bland and uninspiring. This was the worst CD i've heard from Celine.I did take a chance and purchase her latest CD 'One Heart' and it is a definite winner. So if you want the real Celine, buy 'One Heart' and leave this CD in the store."
1,GROSS!,"AH!!!! Please, Celine stop screaming! The only true diva who can reach the high notes and makes it sound good is Mariah Carey. Stop trying to copy her because it won't work. This album is horrible and I didn't like one song on it! This album is like the let down of the century. I thought I was getting something good, but I only tricked myself. I think I will give it to the charity, but they would probably hate me for it. I need to get rid of this CD fast!"
5,"Listen once, you're hooked - twice, a fan for life.","Another album from Dion with no weak selections, this CD has a more eclectic mix of songs than, ""All the way...a Decade of Song"". Her, ""Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)"", a singer's song to her mother, may leave you teary eyed. Her voice has never sounded better than on, ""Prayer"". But her title cut, no doubt about her son, René-Charles, ""A New Day Has Come"", is mesmerizing. You can listen to the album over and over and only enjoy it more and more each time."
1,Not part of Adrian Mole Diaries,"I haven't read this book, but I just want to point out an error. In the listing, along with the title, it says `(Adrian Mole Diaries)'. This book is NOT from the Adrian Mole series, and going by the synopsis, anything but funny."
1,duh,I got this book from a local bookstore and it took me so long to complete reading this book! Seemed like there were couple of loose strings at the end. What happens to Tamara? And what about Crackle and Ken?Didn't enjoy reading this book too much. :-(
5,Best of the Best,"If I had to choose one album to listen to for the rest of my life, this one would be it. After discovering Cheryl Wheeler through a friend, I have done my best to share that wonderful talent with as many people as possible. Last night we took some friends to a fantastic performance in Ann Arbor, and she has even more fans today. Her beautiful lyrics, and hauntingly simple melodies, make you feel as if she has always been a part of your life, and knows exactly how you feel.Add to that her wonderful sense of humor, and great ability to change gears in a heartbeat, and you have one of the most versatile, honest performers to grace any stage. How lucky are we to see her in an intimate venue like The Ark! Please hurry back, Cheryl."
2,"Not that funny, but a beautiful voice","I first got to know Cheryl Wheeler from her funny songs on the Sylvia Hotel CD. I also saw her in concert where I was taken with her folksy loving insightful songs. I also thought she was very bright and had an unbelievable way with words. But still the songs that got me most were the ones that were kind of funny. I have to say in a collection album with 19 songs, they are all very somber, and not the funny ones I was looking for. Her voice is beautiful, and the lyrics are still compelling, but don't plan to laugh."
1,DON' T DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!,"Like many in here who have posted already, the Philips DVDR985 worked fine at first, sort of. I've wasted many $$ on dvd media that did not work in the unit, only to find out later it wasn't the media that was bad, it was the unit.I've called and emailed customer no-service. Don't waste your time.I wrote a letter to the CEO- haven't heard back, probably won't.I now own a very expensive and useless piece of equipment.When it did work- for the first few months, it worked well.Join the campaign. Demand that Philips recall this ""lemon!"""
1,Philips has troubles,A year ago I ordered a Philips DVDR 1500. Lots of troubles from the start. Sent back to service after 1 month for a new motor. About a year later I sent it back again because of several error messages on the screen. They replied that they are discontinuing the DVDR-1500 and they will replace it with a DVDR-985. The DVDR 985 arrived on Monday. I burned one DVD... by Thursday it too was dead. I called technical support they are going to replace this one also. Now I see all over the web that Philips is having lots of trouble with DVD recorders. Good luck if you buy this. Pioneer is the best at DVD recorders.
1,Nothing but trouble!,I'm one of those suckers that paid over $900- for this machine. Don't be like me!! Don't buy this recorder! The unit is now being serviced for the second time and i know it will not work when i get it back (Just like the first time) I can only pray that the Good Guys will replace it with ANOTHER BRAND. I will never buy another Philips product again. NO MORE!!
2,Cannot Recommend This Machine!!,"I have to agree with all of the negatives talked about in the earlier reviews. I have just encountered my third ""disc error"".....which is the kiss of death for this machine. It has already been in the shop twice for this problem, and it is not going to be worth my time to get it fixed again. The ""bleaching / white-out"" problem is also something that you have to be on top of at all times. I have had to do more than a few re-records to correct this problem. Anyway, I am heading out to look at the Sony unit. I should have started with that one!!"
1,shame on philips,It worked OK for a year then the disc error messages started.Sent it to be repaired and they told me the laser needed to be repaired for $700. I cannot understand how it would cost as much to fix as it did to buy. This is the last philips product for me in this lifetime. I will pass my feelings along too.
1,Not worth the money,I had purchase this DVD recorded last year in 2002 and I only had it the house for about 4 month the most of the time it was in the repair shop ever time I get it back and it still does not work this DVD recorder will eat up and distroy DVD+R and DVD+RW I had lost about 25 disk to this machine the best DVD recorder is Sony
1,Defective Product Warning,"This DVD recorder is simply defective. I have contacted some fellow buyers, and reviewed dozens of web opinions. They all point to the same fatal defects in this product (disc errors, etc.) Shame on Phillips for marketing this junk, and further shame on this company for not stepping up and recalling all of them. CONTACT ME IF YOU WANT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT PROBLEMS WITH PHILIPS DVD RECORDERSAmazon should allow a ""zero star"" rating -- there is no positive news for Phillips customers."
1,After 5 months many problems,"I purchased the DVDR985 in January of 2003. Initially it worked as advertised and I was pleased. After a couple of months I began to have problems. Some DVD+RW disks that were written on the recorder now show ""no disk"" when loaded. Some DVD+R disks get errors when I try to record. The recorder seems to ""forget"" that a DVD+RW disk is RW and shows it as DVD so that I can no longer record. Now that I have some time, I will get the firmware updated and if necessary send it in for repair. At this point I am not happy with the product but there are not many other choices."
1,design flaw,Recorded audio has frequency change. Audio randomly sounds like a tape slowing down and speeding up. Chipmunk effect. Philips team leader in Jamaica admits to problem and says engineers are working on. Have ruined about 15 DVD's. Wait for conformation of fix before purchase. I will update this if flaw is corrected.
3,just ok,"The record quality is maybe as good as SVHS,but vhs copys are much better than from SVHS. Fast foward and rev. don't work that well when played on other dvd players. I've had problems with disc error and destroyed several discs that ""cost money"". This recorder records real time and only notifies of disc error after the recording is complete and not only have you wasted an expensive disc but a lot of time. A rating or 3 stars is generious. I' rather have the money that I spent than the recorder."
1,ever try it w/o a remote?,Without the remote it can't even pretend to be a clock. Worthless tried 4 PHILIPS universal remotes and nothing. Cant wait to do anything with this thing so it can break like the rest out there. Any body with an extra remote?vermin02@hotmail.com
1,ADD Me to the list of the disgruntled EX-Philips customers!,"I purchased a DVDR985 in June of 2002. I had immediate problems with the timer recording. I was shipped a new version of software twice. Each time it worked for a while. Then in September this year (2003) I am getting the famous errors and non-operative drawer etc. Of course the warranty is up and I am stuck with the prospect of paying over half of the cost of a new unit to repair this barely year old piece of what should be part of a class action lawsuit, based on what I have seen and heard. Philips will never see the inside of my wallet again and that includes light bulbs and anything else they have their hand in. There is no way they are not aware of this problem. It is a shame too, because when it worked, I loved the resulting DVD's. My search continues for a reliable DVD+RW......"
1,Worked for a a year or so and now not at all,"I bought this unit a couple of years ago and it worked fine for the first year or so but about 7 months ago it started to have problems and now will not work at all. Anytime I put any disc in there, whether a DVD-R or brand new commercial DVD, it will say ""No Disc"". I've run the diagnostic test but it says ""pass"", DVD lens cleaner no longer helps and when I put that in it says ""No Disc"" as well. Reading all the other bad reviews on here, I won't bother to pay to have it fixed only to have it happen again. I will just cut my $500 loss and will certainly NEVER BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT FROM PHILIPS AGAIN and will advise others not to either."
2,Died after less than one year,"We purchased this item last year, and used it about 6 hours a week, and last month, it stopped working! After paying top dollar for it, I would have expected it to last longer. I was very disappointed!"
1,"Works, then dies.",I bought this in March 2003. It's July 2004 and it no longer works. I even upgraded the firmware. The only reason I bought this is because I trusted the Phillips name and Sony did not have a DVD Recorder out yet. This will be my last Phillips product. Very disappointed.
1,HELP!,Can anyone file a class action lawsuit for this machine? With so many failures it should not have been put on the market.
1,PIECE OF JUNK!!!!,"THE PHILIPS DVDR985 DVD RECORDER WORKED FINE FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS. AFTER THESE COUPLE OF MONTHS IT BEGAN SHOWING ""DISK ERROR, DISK WARNING, NO DISC, STRANGE CODES, FREEZING VIDEO, OVERHEATING, AND INCORRECT CLOCK SETTINGS. I SENT IT TO BE FIXED. IT WORKED ""OKAY"" FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS, OCCASSIONALLY SHOWING THESE ERRORS. AS OF DECEMBER 2003, IT BEGAN TO BREAK DOWN AGAIN. IT IS NOT WORTH IT TO FIX IT, ESPECIALLY IF THE WARRANTY HAS RUN OUT. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. IT'S A PIECE OF JUNK AND SHOULD BE RECALLED!!!!!"
1,MINE'S IN THE DUMPSTER IF YOU WANT IT!,"LIKE SO MANY OTHERS, I LAID OUT A LOT OF MONEY FOR ONE OF THESE WHEN THEY FIRST CAME TO MARKET. IT WORKED OK FOR A WHILE, BUT THEN (AS SEEMS TO BE THE PATTERN) IT TOOK ON A QUIRKY NATURE THAT CONTINUED TO DETERIORATE UNTIL THE MACHINE BECAME NEXT TO USELESS. MYSTERIOUS ""DISC ERRORS"" PREVENTED THE PLAYING OF DISCS THAT I KNEW TO BE PERFECTLY GOOD AND IT LOST THE ABILITY TO ERASE DVD-RW. TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS I REPLACED THIS PIECE OF JUNK WITH A PANASONIC DMR-E80H. THE PANASONIC IS FAR MORE CAPABLE WHEN IT COMES TO RECORDING DVD, PLUS IT HAS AN80GB HARD DRIVE, ALL FOR HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS LESS. IT IS TOO SOON TO SAY HOW RELIABILITY WILL BE, BUT IT ABSOLUTELY COULD NOT BE ANY WORSE THAN THE FAR MORE EXPENSIVE PHILIPS. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Unpredictable Machine,I bought this unit from Amazon.com after reading good reviews from this site.The machine is irratic.The unit shut off itself and the sreen show the data is unrecognized. Ruined many discs.Finally the machine would not turn on even after numurous resets and system checked.I returned to factory service store.I hope they can fix glitchs or wasting big fortune.
1,A lemon by all standards!,"At $963.83 on May 25, 2002 I bought this product, that now sells for less than half the price I paid. Since the very beginning, this diabolic machine gave us trouble with its tendency to perform in unusual ways (as compared with the similar DVD players we own). Now, it has ceased to function entirely due to (what the repair man confirms) is a set of instructions programmed by Philips to render the machine useless to its very owner... Great!Don't buy this trash, which I'm using as a test of amazon.com's reliability and good will to its naive customers."
1,don't buy a philips dvd recorder,"I, like untold numbers of others, have been saddled with a DVD recorder that doesn't work. I began having ""disc error"" problems within a few months of purchasing my DVDR985A. Customer service blew me off with telling me that it was due to bad (scratched/dirty) discs. The problem was intermittent until, of course, the warranty period expired, and then became permanent. Repair people then told me I may have a bad recording laser, but it would cost nearly $400 to replace, and no guarantee that it would cure the problem....I bought a SONY. I know learn that Philips is FULLY AWARE of the ""disc error"" problem, but a call to the customer service department today resulted in being told that ""Philips knows nothing about this problem"". Go to google, type in Philips dvdr985 disc error, and read the NUMEROUS reports of their knowledge...seems to be something about a glass laser that they replaced with a plastic laser. DON'T BUY>"
1,Never Again!,"Purchased my DVDR 985 brand spanking new from there will let your imagination run wild. For those of you not having problems ...give it time. My unit took about year and half to start acting up. Not a lot of heavy use just at the onset. DVDR display panel started coughing up some sort of code AB F15B6B then when I tried opening the disc player door it would change code displayed to AB F09977. Contacted Phillips and was asked slew of questions only to be told at the end "" we can give you a certified repair facility"". And yes I asked what the code meant but the talking head at the other end did not know. My collection of DVD players and recorders exceeds the number in average house hold and of the lot the Phillips DVDR 985 failed WAY to early in its life span, for this customer."
1,It died,"I had a similar experience- it died shortly after the warrenty expired. Tech support mailed me a firmware update but no help.I finally called their warrenty repair center and was told to send it in for evaluation for $40. They thought it was the lazer and would be over $400 with labor. I called the Phillips center in Tn. and they will fax me an extended warrenty for parts and I will have to pay the $150 labor charge if it is the Lazer. I bought a Sony today for $449. Sorry Philips, my upcoming plazma TV purchase will not be a Philips."
4,Terrific Unit With A Few Drawbacks,"For the most part I totally love this machine. It does all as promised. Its drawbacks are a rather klutzy interface system, that takes some getting used to, using the remote. Its a bit cryptic, but read the manual, that helps a lot. I also do not like how it rather takes over your tv. You cannot even watch tv unless this thing is powered on for instance. You also need to know that you cannot record one station while watching another like we do with vcrs. Overall, this machine is super though. Plug my camcorder right into the front panel, push a couple buttons and I am making my own dvd of my tape. A real beauty for the most part."
4,I own 3 - Here's the scoop,"Here's what you really need to know about this unit. The early production models have problems that result in ""Disc Error"" while recording. I have had two units go bad. One the store exchanged. The other, which was 7 months old, Philips cheerfully replaced with a brand new unit. All three of my units now turn out high volume reliably. As for quality, the firewire input results in digital noise in the black areas due to conversion to MPEG2. The S-Video input provides better (near perfect) results. If you are copying a DVD and use the Component inputs (to my surprise) the resulting copy is indistinguishable from the original. My third unit I bought as an open box special from Best Buy for $149. It also didn't record but Philips repaired it under warranty. I am extremely happy with the units and with Philips support of the product."
1,Have these been recalled?,"I was told by an employee of ""Best Buy"" that the Philips DVD recorder that they carried is not avcailable because of a recall.Does anyone have any detailed info?"
1,Poor technical assistance from Philips,"My recorded DVD+R and DVD+RW's will not play on any of my existing DVD players, I contacted Philips online and after one month, have not got a reply.The machine works well when the discs are played in it however if you have thoughts of making copies for your friends, forget it. I don't think the limitation of this recorder justifies the price. P.S SINCE MY LAST REVIEW MY MACHINE HAS COMPLETELY DIED. I SENT IT TO PHILIPS FOR REPAIRS BUT IT CAME BACK WORSE THAN BEFORE. PLEASE I IMPLORE YOU DONT BUY THIS UNIT!!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"Only 6 months old and already problems.The machine worked great at first, but now????? It was a wonderful machine while it worked...."
1,Poor product & poor customer service,"I have relied on online reviews for years and have never posted one until now. After my unit broke down, I went to the web to find out if I was the only one experiencing a problem. To my dismay, it appears that I like many, now own a lemon of a DVD recorder.This unit has never been easy to use or intuitive in its operation. Its also very annoying that one can not navigate all functions without the remote control.Now, after less than 7 months(and very little use), it doesn't record or even play brand new DVD's. This is a lemon. Save yourself money and heartburn. Do not buy this product."
2,"Love having a DVD recorder, but would buy other brand","This DVD recorder does not record on 4X discs, which are becoming standard media. I even downloaded and ran the firmware upgrade, which promised compatibility.I contacted customer service, and they are absolutely useless. As mentioned in many other reviews, the agents don't speak English very well. It took several tries for the agent to be able to record my simple phone number.If you do chose to buy this product because of its price, then be sure to stock up on slow 1x discs."
1,Quirky and unsupported,"I was only able to record 3 discs successfully before the unit began to refuse to finalize discs, making them unplayable on any unit, including itself, claiming the disc held unrecognizable data. Phillips' customer service could not understand what I was talking about, and sent me a firmware upgrade disc, which only made matters worse, as the disc menu began flashing randomly and incoherently, and the unit was unresponsive to commancs. I returned the unit."
2,DON'T EVER BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"I have had to return this DVD recorder 4 times and have had problems with all 4 recorders (problems w/ disc recognition, disc writing and reading problems). I contacted the Philips company and they are very, very RUDE and are NOT any help at all. Spend your money elsewhere. The Panasonic seems to be the better choice from what I have read even though I have not actually used one."
1,"Philips DVDR985 is a $500 clock--in other words, it SUCKS!","BEWARE!! I bought this hunk of junk in July '03. One month after the one-year warranty expired, it quit. ""Disc error"" after recording a three and a half hour football game! Now I put a disc in, it says either ""No disc"" or something about the format being unrecognizable. I put in a factory recorded disc--The Matrix--and I get ""No disc."" I haven't tried the firmware update yet, but from reading other reviews here, I have little faith it will work. I agree with another fellow that Philips should recall these units. They are complete JUNK!!!"
2,Won't Work in a DVD Player,"I just want to emphasize for those of you who are considering buying this unit, the DVD+R discs will never work in any brand of DVD player. Period. So if that's a consideration for you, don't buy this unit.DVD-Rs, which can be recorded in Panasonic E30, HS2 and Toshiba RD-X2 units, can be played in *most* DVD players (more likely to work in newer units rather than older machines)."
1,Don't do it!,"What started off great turned into a nightmare. I'am having the same problems as the other reviews. It started off great for 3 months, then the disc errors started. now it will only record in the rw mode. I made 25 dvd+rs, with about 4 discs ruined. nowevery disc i put in it just powers the machine off. I called phillips and there going to send me the firm upgrade. I'am not holding my breath this is going to work. Sony just came out with a dvd recorder that supports +r,-r,+rw,-rw.Phillips should not have put this on the market. For those of you who also have this machine, and hve no problems yet. WAIT It's coming.For they rest of us owners I guess we learned an expensive lesson."
1,Worst Piece Of S_H_I_T I ever had,I wasted about $900.00 on this f_U_C_KING electronic garbadge. It worked fine at first then the last few months I have been getting more and more DISC WARNINGS!!!!!!!!!! How many people have seen that before? DR ________bite (*&^*((* me. Thanks allot to Phillips for having the decency to sell this JUNK to unsuspecting DVD lovers. Now that I know about a thousand other people have had problems along with mine. Im gonna take mine apart or throw it on a concrete pavement somewhere and take more of my frustration out. I HATE THIS MACHINE and I hope whoever invented it and passed along the unit to sell dies!
4,pretty good machine,"I'm very satisfied with the quality and ease of use. The inputs and outputs are great. Compatibility is also sweet. The ability to set chapter marks around commercials, and then make those chapters ""hidden"", thus skipped on playback, is also very nice, even though frame advance for mark setting is not as exact as I think it should be.Title setting is a bit of a pain with just arrows, but it's alright. Philips tech support helped me discover that RF output is pass-through only. To see DVD Recorder output requires using one of the other generous outputs.Tech support also says there is no way to record via i.Link from PC. That's an unfortunate limitation that brought my rating down from a 5. Although they said it wouldn't work, I was able to get signal through a Firewire DV Bridge once. I've not been able to duplicate that success since. I know it's possible from a hardware standpoint, but firmware/software limitations are not supporting it."
4,"why isn't an ""O"" ring provided with the filter?","I am happy with the filter, however an ""O"" ring should be provided along with the filter. To purchase the ""O"" ring separate would cost $3.99 plus $6.99 s&h.;Ridiculous."
5,Wonderful tool--a must have for any breeder,"Excellent tool for evaluating puppies. Truly a must have for any reputable breeding program.My only complaint is its a bit dry. Although the information is gold, the film quality coupled with Mrs. Hastings's monotone voice can be a bit difficult to pay attention to."
3,Low quality,"Great information, learned a lot about the structure of a puppy, but the quality of the dvd is very, VERY low... The sound is also very crappy."
5,Last Words of Legends,"Well, this is definitely a page turner and a flip through and a go back and read again and share and tell people they just have to read it.Imagine, so many wrote their last words poetically. Some wrote pages while others wrote short. ""I demand a recount."" ""Mispronounced dead on arrival."" And perhaps you'll guess who wrote one word ""Imagine!""My absolute favorite, laugh out loud epitath--When my time on earth is doneAnd I have breathed my lastI want them to bury me upside downSo my critics can kiss my ass"
3,Even new model with plastic liner scratches,"Brand new out of the box this thing put noticeable horizontal scratches on the blade of my Kershaw D.W.O. 3001 pocketknife. And yes, I do have the new version with a plastic liner. I cannot speak to the trick of using a homemade paper liner as protection, as I haven't dared use it again. A disappointment. Three stars, because it is functional apart from the scratching problem. See my images."
1,Great for getting that perfect scratch along a new knife blade.,"Because of this awful product, which didn't help me sharpen the knife at all, I now have a scratch that runs the length of my new Global Chef's knife. Thanks piece of crap sharpening guide!"
2,Average at best,"If you want an extra gadget to take up space in your kitchen, then go ahead. Otherwise, I would stay away from this one."
3,Still one of my favorites,"This movies takes the idea of constructing a time paradox and then explores what might happen, making you sit up and ask yourself, ""What if..."" and, after all, isn't that what science fiction is all about? Keeping with a main storyline, it explores various possibilities and different circumstances all at the same time."
4,good sci-fi,for a sci-fi fan even a bad sci-fi movie is better than none. this movie is well done and i like the time travel angle and the stark futuristic landscape.this movie takes itself seriously and is very watchable.i felt is was worthy of my collection.
1,Abomination,"IMDb gives this movie 4.0/10. For those unacquainted with their scale, anything below a 7 is very poor, and anything below a 6 is scraping the bottom of the barrel. To compare, Halloween 5 received 4.4, and Cannibal Holocaust a 6.1. The plot is terrible, the acting is terrible, and the script is one of the worst I've come across. There is not a single redeeming feature to this movie.It will be enjoyed by masochists and prepubescent boys."
3,Good Prayer Primer,"There's one thing that's absolutely clear after reading this book: Ralph Martin loves God. If one didn't know he is Catholic, one would think he is Protestant the way he seems on fire with love of God. (I agree with Martin on this point that we Catholics have a lot to learn from our Protestant friends on this issue). He is especially passionate about the Charismatic Renewal and the effect it has had his love for God.Martin gives a lot practical advice on prayer, i.e. set a time to pray daily, set a specific place to pray, ways to clear your head of the clutter before praying. He also discusses the different types of prayer. There isn't much in the way of techniques, but there is some very good information for one just starting to incorporate prayer into his/her daily life.It's not a must-read, but it's a good read - I think we can all learning something from Martin's personal story and struggles. Recommended for someone just starting to pray daily."
2,What a disappointment!,"This would never have been published as a first novel. I had read and loved earlier books by Jeanne Dams and was looking forward to reading this book. But the plot was almost nonexistent and the protagonist, young Helda, unbelievable and not very likeable. You had to do more than suspend disbelief with this book, since everything about the book was so improbable."
2,Farfetched and disappointing,"I loved Jeanne Dams' Dorothy Martin series and looked forward to reading about her new heroine Hilda Johansson. Unfortunately, I found Hilda an unsympathetic and unbelievable protagonist. The plot has Hilda, a Swedish servant in a well-to-do household, investigating the death of a relative of the prominent family next door. Hilda, with sixteen years of a Swedish upbringing and only three years in America (which according to my calculations makes her all of nineteen) is found entering into such wildly diverse activities as rescuing another immigrant wrongly accused of the murder, planting stories in the press, and of course outwitting the police, all while cleaning house. The book is well-researched in terms of the lives of the servant class in the year 1900 but I think Ms. Dams seems more in control of her material when writing about the middle years of her widowed and remarried expatriate Dorothy Martin."
2,An interesting period piece but a failure as a mystery,"After thoroughly enjoying Ms Dams books and finding her character Dorothy Martin a vibrant and delightful character I was very disappointed in her new series. Her writing of the period and the life of an immigrant servant I am sure are well researched and accurate. The mystery was contrived and secondary to the story. Hilda Johansson at nineteen, although portrayed as an extremely intelligent young lady, was too brash and manipulating to come across as a character that I would be interested following on further adventures. If some of the characters had been developed further instead of being used just as Hilda's pawns I feel that the book would have had more life and Hilda would have been better portrayed. The most interesting part of the book was Ms Dams portrayel of the servant class at the turn of the century."
3,enjoyable characters but an uninteresting mystery,"This is the first of a series of mysteries involving Hilda Johannson, a young Swedish immigrant who works in the largest mansion in South Bend, Indiana. Her two sisters and a brother also work in the town and she is courted, somewhat reluctantly, by Patrick, a charming Irish fireman. Her employers are kind, though the butler Mr. Williams is a bit of a tyrant, and things are generally good until Hilda and Patrick discover a murdered woman near the mansion.There were a lot of things I liked about this book. Hilda is an intelligent young woman who manages to work successfully in an oppressive environment, but she also has character flaws, like a stubborn streak and a bad temper, and that makes her believable. Her friends and family are interesting, and Patrick is an admirable partner.The mystery, however, was neither interesting nor explained well, though I trust other reviewers who like the author's work, and would give this series another try."
4,Mixed reviews.,"The previous reviews have summed up the plot fairly well. They've also disagreed on the merits of the story itself, and surprisingly enough, I agree with all of them. The mystery IS weak, with an annoying loose end or two never tied down. But I found Hilda to be a charmer, perhaps too progressive for the day, but a young lass of wit and determination. Will her romance with Patrick Cavanaugh go any further? (Swedes and the Irish did not really mix socially.) She faces a tremendous handicap in her detective work, as servants essentially needed permission to even leave the house, much less ask questions and do whatever footwork needs to be done. So Hilda is also resourceful, and I'm anxious to see how she fares in her next adventure."
4,Character Driven,"This was an entertaining book. As mentioned in other reviews, plot devices and character actions are frequently flimsy and even outrageous, but Jeanne M. Dams writes lovely characters and believable dialogue.I have read all the Dorothy Martin books...again, for the characters, not necessarily the plot, and I intend to do the same for the Hilda Johansson seriesFor fans of the historical mystery, it's an excellent selection, and I look forward to tracking down the rest of the series."
3,A stretch,"Ms. Dams' Dorothy Martin series is extremely enjoyable, but this one is a stretch--wooden characters, thin plotlines...not a great read!"
2,Boring,The plot to this story was extremely boring with a very weak mystery. The characters were unbelievable and not very likable. Was difficult to even finsh the book.
3,High drama in Venice!,"I like these guys a lot. That being said, this is the all-time GAC drama-fest. There's a scene at the beginning of the investigation with a close up of Zak sort of anguishing over his severe drained energy and a second later hears something and amazingly (ha!) comes alive like a 17 year old on his first date. Then there's a light thing which moves down a wall and he comments that it goes into and out of view in a single video frame...of course this isn't possible, as it's moving and multiple frames are required for that, but that's not really that big of an error and I got what he meant. Has one of the best Aaron 'Oh My God's"" ever recorded!! He is the king of the OMG! This is a perfectly fine episode, but seriously laced with classic GAC dramatic commentary."
3,Good news and bad news,"Ghost Adventures is my favorite show. The Travel Channel, however, leaves a lot to be desired when they are releasing these DVD sets. The good news: for those of us upset by the missing episodes from the ""Season 2"" DVD set - they're included in this set. The bad news: the ""Season 3"" set is missing many, many episodes. I don't understand how Travel Channel picks and chooses episodes to put on these discs and why the discs aren't in chronological order by original air date. I agree with the other reviewer who said for this to be a true set of last season's episodes, it needs to include all episodes from Gettysburg to Loretta Lynn's Plantation. Off the top of my head, I've counted several missing episodes. Shame on you, Travel Channel!"
4,Thanks for the quick delivery.,This show has been watched over and over and over again..... We have to stop our kid from watching it just to take a break.
1,no closed-captioning ??? !!!,"I gave this to my wife for Christmas along with other presents including the season 4 DVD - because she loves the show and always DVR's it. (I can't watch the show - it's ridiculous). Anyway, my wife likes to use closed-captioning to make sure that she follows the conversation - but it appears to not be available on either of these DVD's - relatively new products. 'not recommended."
5,Ghost Adventures Season 3 List,"Here's the Offical DVD Menu List.Disc 1:Easten State Penitentiary-Philadelphia, PaRemington Arms Factory-Bridgeport, CTOld Washoe Club/Chollar Mine-Virginia City, NVExecution Rocks Lighthouse-Long Island, NYProspect Place-Trinway, OHDisc 2:Hill View Manor-New Castle, PAWaverly Hills Sanatorium-Louisville, KYVulture Mine-Vulture City, AZLa Palazza-Las Vegas, NVFort Chaffee-Greenwood, ARDisc 3:Armagossa Hotel & Opera House-Death Valley Junction, CAU.S.S. Hornet-San Francisco, CARolling Hills Asylum-East Bethany, NYReturn To Bobby Mackey's Music World-Wilder, KYBonus Feature:Longfellow's Wayside Inn-Sudbury, MA (Valentine's Day Special)Personally, I think this should have been a box set and have ALL of the episodes from Gettysburg all the way to Loretta Lynn's Plantation House episodes. Do we all agree on this?"
2,HEY Travel Channel,"TRAVEL CHANNEL, WHEN I BUY A GHOST AVENTURES DVD ANY SEASON. I DON'T WANT IT BEEPED OUT IF THEY SWEAR I WANT TO HEAR THAT. WE ARE THE PEOPLE BUYING THESE DVD SETS. WHEN I WATCH THEM IN MY HOUSE I WANT TO HEAR EVERYTHING THEY SAY. EVERYTHING, I DON'T CARE HOW BAD YOU THING IT IS. IT SHOULD BE UP TO ME NOT YOU.."
1,TOO BAD.,Season 1 started off great but the 2nd disc was all jacked up. Wouldnt work on two different DVD players or the drive on my laptop. I would sent it back but it cost more to send it back than the disk set cost to begin with.Oh well ! Good job Travel Channel.
3,Missing episode,ok...so this was a good season...but they have one of the most important episodes off the discs...i mean wtf...am i the only one that liked poveglia island??
4,I'm just clarifying something,"I was prompted to write a review, not because of my great love for the film, but to clarify what I have read in others reviews. 1.In Japan the main characters name is GALLY, as in the DVD. It was Americanized into ALITA when the manga came out in the US. 2. In Japan the name of the floating city was ZALEM and once again it was turned into TIPHARES in the US version of the Manga. and 3. YUGO is YUGO in Japan and the DVD, but turned into HUGO in the US manga. There...now I'm done with my nitpicking. -Eli@"
1,"If you've read the comics, don't buy this video...","The movie is just a bland review of the first comic's plot, but without the character richness and the frightening violence of the books. Maybe did the rating do that, but it really feels like Yukito Kishiro was betrayed in the deal. Other than that, it's a nice and clean anime for teens... but it could have been so much more!"
2,Depends,"To begin, I am a die-hard fan of the Battle Angel Alita manga. When I first saw this 'episode' of the Battle Angel anime and the anime version of 'Tears of an Angel' I was very disapointed. I agree with the offcial reveiw that it is impossible to translate Yukito Kishiro's extensive manga into an animated format without losing the incredible artwork. However, the loss of the story is what disapointed me the most.I feel that the depth of the original plot is simply cheapened in the anime. The main villian (Makaku in the manga) has been replaced by a simple ""brain eating gladiator"". The intense scenes where Alita attempts to save Koyomi from Makaku are completly left out. The anti-hero Desty Nova, who plays a significant role in the later books, is also missing.If you have never read the manga, you may enjoy this.If you have read and enjoy the manga, you may want to save your money."
2,Not quite up to par...,"Well I must say I was quite disappointed by this video. Having read the manga and being a die-hard fan, I was kind of put out. The name change was utterly horriffic, not to mention the story in general: Basically, for those of you who don't know, they took the first 2 volumes of the greatest series of all time and hacked them up into this video. The change of name to Zolom and the entrance of Sharin, who was never even IN the real thing, made me mad. Not a bad anime on its own though, so see it if you feel like it."
2,not very good,"Although, unlike most movies, the story for the most part remains true to the books, it just isn't very good. The voices are horrible and they leave out some important stuff. If you just want a nice action film, it's alright, but if you are a fan of the manga, it's down right blasphemy!"
