1,"A Bad design, made with inferior materials","I was looking for a grater that was easy to clean. This one seems like a good idea... until it collapses on you. The sides don't spread apart far enough, so it is unstable and without proper pressure it folds up. With proper pressure it works until the plastic breaks. I'm surprised Oxo designed this. I'll be going back to the old fashion ""box"" style grater."
2,Another broken grater,"I had hopes when I bought this one, as I have usually had success with OXO products.Sadly, this grater was not one of those successes. I didn't pay a lot for it, around $10 and it lasted about 6 months. But the plastic gave way on the sides, so now I only have the side that is for finer grating. Which I don't do that often. The cracks start at the corners of the steel grating piece and eventually they just break completely.It needs a stronger design and then it would be much better."
1,"OK design, poor materials","I like the design of this grater: it doesn't take up much space and is easy to clean because it comes apart. Unfortunately, the white plastic broke in several places after only a few months of use."
1,The poorest Oxo product I've ever purchased,"I LOVE Oxo's Good Grips products, so I had high hopes for this cheese grater. After only a few uses, the plastic casing cracked, making it unstable & difficult to use. Pass on this grater & go for one with more metal."
1,Wasted money,I ordered this back in December 2003 and as of March 2004 still have not received any issue. The Magazine Express service that coordinates these subscriptions provides no customer service and Amazon won't do anything about it either. Don't bother ordering this unless you just want to throw money away because they will bill your credit card and give you nothing in return. Amazon doesn't care about providing customer service on this and all Magazine Express is interested in is your money.
1,DON'T ORDER THIS,"It's hard to add something new to what's already been said. I placed this order as a gift back in October of 2006 and here it is almost the end of February of 2007 and STILL no magazine! Amazon tells you to call Magazine Express which handles the magazine orders. However the Magazine Express customer service is a joke at best, and they do NOTHING to try to correct the problem. They promise to check into it and call you back, but they never do. And like the others have said, Amazon doesn't provide customer service on magazine subscriptions either. Obviously neither Amazon nor Magazine Express care about helping customers with problems. I guess I'll end up like the customer ""ggruschow"" and end up learning about their cancellation and refund policy. If THAT exists. Just an awful, awful, awful experience..."
5,Another great singer from Brazil,"This is a delightful disc from Brazil, which seems to have more than its fair share of great singers. After hearing a few cuts from this disc over a car radio while stuck in traffic in So Paulo about a month ago, I bought a copy on the same day, and I haven't been disappointed. It's too bad that Leila Pinheiro isn't better known in the States!"
5,Quality Toy - looks great - withstands use/abuse,"We recently started collecting wooden toy train things for our 3 year old son- he loves this plane -and after a 3 months of hard (read: daily throwing/crashing/stomping) use the paint has not chipped, the wheels are still attached and the magnet still pulls - even bigger trains around the track -the colors may vary from the picture :)"
1,Could damage some notebooks! Beware!,"I would buy this except the airflow is wrong for my laptop and I believe could damage it. Averatec notebooks are very powerful packages for a relatively modest price, however they do run hot, just like their more expensive cousins. I do need a cooler, but it has to be one that blows air toward the bottom of the case, since that is where the air intake is located. A negative pressure would work against the computer cooling fan and would likely in higher internal temperature. The widely distributed Targus works the same way. I don't know how many laptops have the air intake on the bottom, but that is something to check before buying one of these coolers. Amazon could really help by being sure that the information was included in the description of all such coolers. Some tell you and some don't. I'm still looking."
2,Not What I Expected,"Before I say why I didn't like the film that much, let me say that this film is for the younger generation (up to college age); not older adults. After I received the movie, five of us watched it but only two finished watching it. My niece and I were the only two that finished the movie, however, overall I wasn't a big fan either. My niece was the only one that thought it was a good movie but she is also the only one that is college age.The concept was fabulous, the film just didn't live up to the concept. Alot of good questions were asked, and struggles shown, but no real solutions. We all have struggles but I was hoping to use the film to help others find solutions to those struggles. Not just talk about them and then end the movie basically in the same situation...struggling. But then again, maybe that's reality. However, I do wish they had some sort of hope and direction to help solve it."
5,I've passed it on!,"This movie was good enough that I've passed it on to my local Teen group (majority of them are boys ~ which they will easily relate to). An honest look at this world and the ""pleasures"" it offers. These pleasures are momentary. The phrase that comes to mind is ""There are a lot of people who believe in Jesus, but they don't FOLLOW Jesus."" That's what needs to transpire. Jesus wants you to follow him. Not a church, not a doctrine, not a philosophy. Him. Simply Him."
1,Beware of this DVD!,"It is so poorly filmed and edited, I couldn't find the point. It's about a bunch of (rich?) college kids visiting every country in Europe and behaving like the ugly Americans. Don't buy this. If you MUST see it, rent it instead, but I bet you can't sit thru the whole thing. Don't worry about younger kids seeing this- they'll be so bored they'll get up and leave. More like a Bevis and Butthead do Europe."
2,didnt really like it,"a little too corny, just about the same as watching someone elses family vacation movie.Perhaps future productions will be better."
2,did not hold my interest,I never finished watching it. I tried watching it with a 12 year old and neither one of us liked it. I'm 67.
3,needs more depth,"I purchased this video hoping for some thought provoking questions, as well as a variety of responses from people of all types of backgrounds. It seemed like these guys asked questions on a particular topic, then we hear only 3-4 responses from other people. I feel that this video would be good for younger teenagers, not so much for older audiences. I myself am a Christian who has grown up in America but has spent most of my 20s in Europe. Having lived in both worlds, it's been my experience that American Christians tend to be more ""by the book,"" whereas European Christians tend to be more laid back (just my personal experience). They tend to have different mindsets when it comes to some of the issues brought up in this video, and I was hoping to see more of that. This video only touched the surface and could have gone deeper."
2,"Beware Catholics, of Trojan Horse","I bought the DVD with a chance it might be a positive witness for teens and a forum for discussing faith in Jesus Christ to offset difficult cultural influences. I should have suspected a trojan horse with a cover picture in front of St Peter's Basilica. I found most discussions and topics acceptable to a Catholic audience. However, an unsupported and repeated claim that Jesus did not found a Church will not fly in Catholic circles. Try to find that claim in scripture without ignoring direct wording to the contrary! Fundamentalists should find this section righteous, but for a Catholic, unless you want to have scripture interpreted for you by young fledgling college students with no philosophy or theology study, I suggest you pass on this video."
2,VERY SSLLLLOOOOWWW Movie,"This movie is very slow and comes across as more preachy than inspirational, could not finish the first half of the movie."
4,Entertaining and thought provoking,Entertaining and thought provoking. A good honest look at what the American church has become and what it should be.
5,Great movie REAL perspective!,"This movie will be a great asset to any youth library. It gives teens and adults a look at what the real purpose of this life is and what we are to do. The amazing ending about the tough choice to follow Christ, is so real!"
1,You're better off with a Timex,At least Timex customer service gets the watch back in under a month.I bought the watch the end of March. By June the crystal had a crack in it. It's not like I'm a rock climber -- there was no impact of which I'm aware. Luminox customer service makes it clear that the crystal isn't covered -- but it will take over a month for them to replace it (for $65 with shipping!) and get it back. Really sorry that I bought this watch.
2,Disappointing,"This band is defiantly not for water, it remains wet for hours and catches bad odorI had to replace the band.The watch is also disappointing looks more a toy watch than a military."
5,Great watch! Boyfriend loved it!,"My boyfriend is into anything military related and he needed a durable watch(his last one didn't survive the swimming pool). He absolutely loved this watch. It has a velcro strap that is easy to take on and off. It is water resistant and the hand on the face glow really bright at night. This watch seems to be a lot more durable, hopefully it will last."
4,Good Best Of Collection.....,"....but WHY ON EARTH did they edit out the 30 second begining of ""I Hear You Now"" ???? OH! I just Hate when they do things like that!!!Otherwise....very satisfied.The old geezer"
5,Are you a friend of......? Do you work for mother?,"Jon & Vangelis-The best radio play and hits from the first 3 lps. Short Stories,The Friends of Mr. Cairo,Private Music. These are from 1981-1984. This fits well in many catagories. New Age,Electronica,New Wave,Progressive Rock.Top 40 Pop.Experimental.Great songs:I Hear You Now, He Is Sailing,Italian Song,I'll find My Way Home.the incredible danceable State Of Independence,and the phenomenal Friends of Mr.Cairo 11:35 long. I still play this album to this date. Every weekend along with OMD hits. Every song on this hits it. Jon's mystical fantasy semi-quasi-religious lyrics makes you think. I rarely use this word to discribe anything but It Is beautiful. What an unusual combination of artists. Who knew?"
1,"Was Great, Now Terrible","I got this product about a year before I really started using it, when I got my driver's license. I was doubtful of the sound quality of adapting through the cassette deck, but it was cheaper than an FM transmitter. It actually sounds really great, and there's really no distinguishable loss in sound quality. The only downside was that it constantly clicked all the time (the cassette itself, not the sound from the stereo), but I only noticed it when the volume was very low or silent.Then it changed. Now, after about 2 months of use, it has lost all ability to play midrange, and instead crackles loudly in its place. Turning the midrange all the way off solves this, but then you've got no midrange."
5,It's About Time,"Finally somebody has written a book about Skynyrd. This was a story waiting to be told. There's a lot of details and the interviews with the band members and others give you a lot of food for thought. There's a lot of trash talk, but that's the people being interviewed, not the author of the book. Pretty controversial stuff. Interesting story."
3,Read It If You Need It,"I was very excited when I saw this book.There are not too many Skynyrd books out there.Lots of good stories about the early days, but too many quotes from Artimus Pyle and and none from Gary Rossington make this an unfair portrait, even though Artimus may be ""on the money"" with his remarks about the current ""Skynyrd"". Someday someone will write the definitive book, but for now I guess this will do.Also check out Lynyrd Skynyrd:An Oral History and for fun listen to the Drive-By Trucker's Southern Rock Opera."
3,FREEBIRDS: THE LYNYRD SKYNYRD STORY,"Hardcore Lynyrd Skynyrd fans will be overall disappointed in this book as it is not the hard-charging, tell-all, behind the scenes book that it is talked up to be. One of the biggest problems appears to be the fact that no one in the band, other than Artimus Pyle, was willing to open up and tell it like it is. The author herself seems to be so starry eyed over inteviewing the band members that at times the book comes off as fawning. Casual fans will find the material interesting but the hardcore fan has seen this material before. A much better story was published in MOJO magazine several years ago entitled THE SOUTHERN DEATH CULT. The true Lynyrd Skynyrd story has yet to be written."
5,Good Book,"I liked this book. The stories are very entertaining and I learned a great deal about the Band from the very early days until now. It's quite a story and much deeper than I had known. For that alone, I appreciated the book. While everything obviously hasn't been rosy and there are disagreements today, I felt the book was fair. I enjoyed the pace of the book and would recommend it as a ""must read"" for any Skynyrd fan."
5,Bill Staines is a Modern-Day Woody Guthrie,"Bill's music is full of a love for this country and its people.There is no such thing as a bad Staines CD. Perhaps his best is""Bridges"" which I believe was recorded in Minneapolis in the early 1980's. One review said Staines is at his best when he is with accompaniment. I agree, but this recording is still wonderful, from ""Yellowstone Winds"" to other beautiful heartfelt melodies, this is another winner for a great songwriter. I look forward to buying the Million Miles part two.I've seen Staines once in Fond du Lac and before that in Barron, Wisconsin. A live show will prove to you that all of his recordings have great value!"
5,Absolutely awesome study guide,"I bought this book and the Algebra II version to review for a math placement test (I'm going back to school, hooray!), as well as CliffsQuickReview for Geometry. The study solver series is so wonderful because each problem is worked out CLEARLY with explanations along the way. The study solver books were key for me in reviewing 5 years of high school math in about one month.The only downfall in both the Algebra I and Algebra II books was that there were a few errors. The good side of that though--I knew without a doubt they were typos in exponents or signs simply because the books explained how to work problems (and why they're worked certain ways) so clearly."
1,Very confusing,"This is the worst Algebra book that I have ever come across. I love Algebra and I bought this book just for brushing up and enjoyment purposes. There does not seem to be any rhyme or reason as to the order of the book and the instructions are very confusing.Don't waste your money on this book a much better book is Maran's Illustrated Effortless Algebra. It is a basic Algebra book that is excellent. Its directions are easy to follow and the illustrations are excellent. College Algebra Demystified is also a good book with lots of practice problems, but the explanations are best in Maran's."
2,Not Good,"In several weeks time, I've been going back and forth with Cliffs notes and Schaum's outline of algebra. Thus far, I'm happier with Schaum's than Cliffs. Cliff's is incredibly vague (as is Schaum's, but less often) and so much so that it hampers the scholar from fully grasping the concepts. A major, albeit reoccurring issue I encounter with math guides is that they are way too vague, or they're missing some steps, which happen to be critical in the comprehension of the topic. I can assure you that if you purchase Cliffs notes that you will be overwhelmingly frustrated and irate. Take my word despite other reviews."
4,For those who like the old stuff better than the new stuff,"You don't have to like the bouncy, sugary, weepy (and sometimes cheesy) pop songs that Elton has been putting out lately to like this. Speaking in terms of pop, his stuff in the mid-80's is probably the best. In terms of pop-rock, this album is the best. Actually, this is probably the best Elton John album ever.Not only does it have the classic you've heard before (""Candle in the Wind,"" ""Bennie and the Jets,"" and probably the best song by ELton ever, ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"") but it also has songs like ""This song has no title"" and ""Funeral for a friend"" that no one seems to no about but are as equally brilliant. Each time I listen to this CD I get something new out of it."
5,Classic,Had this as an LP as a kid.Wanted to burn it to ITunes .Great price quick shipping. And resold it near the price I paid.
4,SACD's Rock,"Great disc originally and now even better. Sounds excellent at home on my SACD player, pretty good in the car. A bit bassey in the car but other than that a fine trade up from the original CD recording that was put out some 20 years ago. I have them both and play them side by side and can really hear the SACD difference. Well worth replacing the original and upgrading to SACD players!"
5,One of the all time best albums,"I am not a huge Elton John fan, however I am a huge music fan and I like to think I know good music when I hear it.Great choice of sounds and instruments, well written songs, great lyrics, and of course, Elton's strange and powerfully beautiful style.I have always thought Elton had a very unique style that was hard to pin down. It seems to me that his personal uniqueness has come about from attempting to sound like American country while not successfully escaping his English accent. Listen to ""the Ballad of Danny Bailey"" and tell me I'm wrong.Regardless how this music came about, it works, and its fantasitic."
3,Where is the bonus DVD?,"I ordered: Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (w/ Bonus DVD) [Extra tracks, Hybrid SACD - DSD, Original recording remastered] but in fact I received this: Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (30th Anniversary Deluxe Edition) [Extra tracks, Hybrid SACD - DSD, Original recording remastered].I am assuming that the version with the bonus DVD (which I really wanted) is no longer in stock but Amazon never asked me, never checked to see if I would accept the substitute, they just the 30th anniversary CDs with no bonus DVD. The paperwork mentions the bonus DVD, they asked me to review it, but it is not what I ordered.So please make sure you know what you are going to get from Amazon before you click the ""buy"" button!The 3 stars is because the audio is great, the album a masterpiece, the extra tracks cool. But I sure would have liked the DVD."
4,Goodbye Yellow Brick Road(vinyl),I was very pleased with your product. There were hardly and(if none at all!)scratches on the vinyl. I aws happily surprised to find the lyrics to the sondgs on the inside of the album. And it arrived in such a short time! Thank you so much! It came fron Amazon.
2,Poor in Stereo,"The sound is very crisp and detailed and when it comes to surround sound I have to defer to those who have reviewed it in that format.However, avoid this version if you only intend to listen in stereo and buy the SACD instead. I found that the choir in Candle in the Wind just about vanishes, as does the electric guitar in Funeral for a Friend."
5,Elton John's Best Studio Album Ever,"GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD is Elton John's best studio album ever, consisting of 17 songs which seem to be connected by a common theme of living a fantasy life and then facing reality in the aftermath of a revelation that fantasy and keeping it all inside is really not the best way to live. The title song actually inspired me to continue my move back to older music instead of just listening to whatever happens to be trendy at the time, whereas ""Grey Seal"" mocks the educational system in a way that now inspires me to skip my old school's Thanksgiving Dinner in favor of looking good for my favorite actresses. Make this album, HONKY CHATEAU, TUMBLEWEED CONNECTION, MADMAN ACROSS THE WATER, CARIBOU, and ROCK OF THE WESTIES the first Elton John albums you buy."
4,Elton's Best?,"Yes! Not being a huge Elton John fan, I find ""Yellow Brick Road"" my favorite. In fact what I find interesting is apart from Elton's ""Mad Man Across the Water"" I really don't like his music at all!?!But ""Yellow Brick Road"" is from start to finish an EXCITING ride! You can read elsewhere here at Amazon the fine points of each and every song, so I won't bother with that in my review. I will tell you, however, that my tastes run toward punk, power pop, psychedelia and classical minimalism. So if I like this record you probably will, too.Give Elton's best a try, you won't be sorry."
3,Way overrated,"I am a big Elton John fan, but honestly, this album is not that good. If Elton had wisely chosen to make this a single album, it would have worked, because he's got an album's worth of good material. Instead, he made it a double and included an album's worth of bad material. Rather than do a song by song breakdown, I'll just put each song in the ""good"" category, and the ""not-so-good"" category.Good-Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding, Candle in the Wind, Bennie and the Jets, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, This Song Has No Title, Grey Seal, Sweet Painted Lady, Roy Rogers, HarmonyNot-So-Good- Jamaica Jerk Off, I've Seen that Movie Too, The Ballad of Danny Bailey, Dirty Little Girl, All the Girls Love Alice, Your Sister Can't Twist, Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting, Social DiseaseThis is just my opinion. A lot of people really like this album. I would say that you should buy ""Madman Across the Water"" instead. Or ""Captain Fantastic."""
5,Quintessential Elton John,"While Crocodile Rock may have been his major springboard (Don't Shoot Me ... 1972), the 16 songs featured on Goodbye Yellow Brick Road are arguably the finest of his many collaborations with Bernie Taupin. From the solemn-turned-rocking Funeral for a Friend/Loves Lies Bleeding to the whimsical ballad Harmony, John gives us a splendid example of what one writer once labeled as ""his superlative musical perception."" And few albums spotlight the talents of supporting cast like this: Nigel Olsson in particular deserves major applause for his drumming technique, especially on Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding. I loved this album when it first appeared on vinyl, and I love it as much today on CD."
4,Solid Effort!,"Okay, I'm aware that I'm overrating this one a bit. But after writing several negative Amazon reviews for Elton's first three U.S. studio albums, I'm ready to praise this pop effort. Honky Chateau, Don't Shoot Me, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Captain Fantastic, and Rock of the Westies (no, I didn't forget Caribou...I'm just not all that crazy about it) mark Elton's best period. And one has to admire Elton's effort to release a double-record of pure pop. Bennie and the Jets still remains one of my all-time favorite pop songs. Nevertheless, I feel that this would have made a perfect single album. Elton John is a genius, no doubt about it, but he's a frustratingly inconsistent genius. He's an influential and talented songwriter who, sadly, never recorded a truly great album. Oh, he's made some very good records (Honky Chateau), but never a classic. If he'd trimmed some of the fat off of this record, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road would qualify as one of pop music's most important recordings."
4,Goodbye Yellow Brick Road----In Retrospect.,"Anybody still read ROLLING STONE?? Remember when it was good??!! Now,obviously,I am speaking to my generation here. You know, the days when you could read great writers such as Cameron Crowe,Jon Landau,Steve Pond, and occasionally, Lester Bangs?? I can still remember their review of this album, and the writer just shredded it. No,it wasn't any of the named above.Anyway,this is a fine album.While not on the scale of Tumbleweed Connection, this is still vintage Elton John.However, this is about where he peaked, and for Me, his songs were never quite the same,after.Incidentally, an afterthought about RS-it is a shame that Jann Wenner turned it into a teen slicked, advertising choked, mess."
3,Vinyl is better.,"I used to have the vinyl version of this album but it was destroyed a few years back in a flood. I so wanted to find another copy but the vinyl versions are all but extinct. So I went for the CD.It works ok, but you can tell in a simple listening test that high crescendos generally result in some quite noticeable distortion and clipping. I first thought it was my equipment but the CD plays the same on other high end players as well. A friend's copy also has the same issue. So the transfer from the tapes to digital wasn't done so well.The CD is ok, but if you can find the vinyl, go for that. (Oh; and a decent turntable and cartridge/styli pair!) :)"
2,Elton John Goodbye yellow Brick Road,"I have now owned 3 separate copies of the 1st CD of this 2-disc set for the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road Album. i have been trying for years to obtain the entire album. disc 1 is only the 1st 8 songs of 17 songs. none of the sellers i inquire with can confirm if they are selling the entire album. since I have too many of disc #1, if anyone knows where i can get the 2nd disc, songs 9 to 17, or even the entire 2-disc set as a used CD, let me know. my purchase price was refunded by amazon since this was not what i expected to get. the seller did not even know it was supposed to be a 2-disc set!"
5,An acquired taste for music..................,"...........this collection of music from Sir Elton John is by far one of his best.I am a hard rock,metal, country kick-ass type,who likes soft rock once in a while....well,pretty much a music junkie,but if you have heard an Elton John set,you have the proper balance from a genre,that makes you mentally strong and soulfully blessed.I have seen the man live and always enjoy his energy,very heartfelt!Get rounded and listen up..;o)-"
5,Follow the Yellow Brick Road,Was quick and easy. arrived in 5 days..........in good shape..another good experience...
5,Stands the test of time....,"We all know the songs that got radio play, but don't miss ""Ballad of Danny Bailey"", ""Jamaica Jerk Off"", and my personal favorite of all, with a hint of a bluegrass influence, ""Social Disease"". Elton John goes Hillbille and does it great. These are the true gems of the album, the ones that were never played on the radio."
5,GREAT CD!!!,"I purchaded this CD for my son because it was one of many on his Christmas list. When I saw this on his list, I didn't hesitate to purchase it. How could you possibly go wrong on an Elton John CD? It didn't hurt that the price was very reasonable!"
2,Screw Bernie Taupin,"I was never a big fan of Bernie Taupin's lyrics, which is too bad because Elton himself is a great pianist and has a way with a melody too. Bernie's lyrics positvely blow, however, and get in the way of Elton himself. Songs like the obnoxiously homophobic All the Young Girls Love Alice, racist and sexist Sweet Painted Lady, I've Seen That Movie Too and This Song Has No Title have some of the worst lyrics ever. And some of the songs are awful even without the lyrics: the supremely annoying hit Bennie and the Jets, Roy Rogers, Social Disease, Ballad of Danny Bailey, I've Seen That Movie Too...Anyway, there are only five songs I do like on this album: Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding, Candle in the Wind, title track, Grey Seal and Saturday Night's All Right for Fighting. But this is one thin album outside of those - I'd recommend the self-titled record, Madman Across the Water and Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player instead."
2,Tinny Sound,"The sound on this cd was very bad. Using my imagination I could hear the way the songs sounded originally, but this cd was a big disappointment. Would not recommend it to anyone."
4,Candle in the wind makes it all worth,"It is a good album, not an amazing surround effect but it does something, it has breathtaking high fidelity by the way, the bonus track of Candle in the Wind (Acoustic) makes this album worth every cent, the voice is So Clear, and the acoustic guitars Oh my...!, the rest of the disc is good, three or four songs are not exactly my kind of music but the slow songs are excellent to enjoy both, great music and great audio quality. This disc is not expensive, buy it and you won't regret."
5,Brand new reissue of Yellow Brick Road,"I've been looking for a vinyl copy of this LP for a long time and came across this 2008 reissue. I was hesitant at first because of the price but I am very happy with it. The quality of the recording is very good as was the packaging etc. Of course, there are some differences from the original 1983 releases, changes in the jacket, the record lable etc but they got it close and, as I said, the sound on this record is very good and clean."
5,Elton John's best album,"GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD is excellent. Elton John hit it big with this one. It went number 1 in the US and in the UK. I bought this deluxe edition when I was 10 years old. My mom was a big Elton fan when this came out, so I thought I'll see how good it is. I thought this isn't good...... it's amazing. My fav songs are FUNERAL FOR A FRIEND/LOVE LIES BLEEDING, CANDLE IN THE WIND, BENNIE AND THE JETS, GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD, GREY SEAL, JAMIACA JERK-OFF, SWEET PAINTED LADY, ALL THE YOUNG GIRLS LOVE ALICE, SATURDAY NIGHT'S ALL RIGHT FOR FIGHTING and HARMONY. Elton is my favorite solo artist. Bernie taupin is a great song writer."
5,I am stunned at this SACD,"I have about 20-25 sacds and about 20 dvd audio discs and this one is my new favorite. It sets a new standard in my mind. The mixing was perfect, the quality of the sound put me down in my seat. I just sat back in my recliner through the entire album and let the sound roll over me. I used to skip some songs on the album but now these are ones that I fully appreciate now that I can hear how fantastic they really are.You may not be able to appreciate how good these 5.1 SACD's are unless you have 5 good full range speakers with a decent amp, connections, speaker wire. So please judge them with the understanding that you need an adequate system to play them on to really appreciate them."
1,Do not buy this product!,"We own several OXO products, and love them all...except this one. We liked the ""Good Grips"" handle and the rounded brush. Beyond that, it is useless. The sponge never recieves enough soap, which is frustrating, and the durability is nil. After less that a week, on average, the sponge separates from the plastic backing that attaches it to the soap dispensing handle, rendering it useless. The sponge is barely worn, yet you have to throw it out and buy a new one. This is disappointing for a company that seems to have such well made products. We sent an e-mail describing the design problem to OXO customer service, and did not recieve a satisfactory reply. I hope they listen to their customers and pull this off the market, and replace it with a more durable product."
1,I AGREE: Bad Product,"I agree with all the other reviews! The sponge separates from the plastic after only a few weeks! I actually came to Amazon to see if they sell additional sponges, but after seeing that EVERYONE else is having the same problem, I've come to the conclusion that I would be saving more money if I just threw the thing away and bought a different brand. I LOVE all my other OXO products...."
4,This is called Trance,"This is a great trance album. Granted, it's not the best out there. And it's very general trance. But I think the previous reviewers must have been expecting something else. A LOT of trance is somewhat repitious - thus inducing a trance-like state. I have heard trance attempts that got TOO repititious, and this is not it. There are a few songs here that could have been better, but none of them are bad. If you just want break beats and drum & bass, go check out Digital Empire: DJ Girl. Plenty of that there. If you want good general trance, get this album. If you want GREAT goa trance, check out Hallucinogen (Shpongle) and Pleiadians."
3,A few diamonds in a lot of rough,"This compilation includes some really good tracks hidden between many mediocre ones. Highlights include a nicely shortened version of Robert Miles' ""Children"" (#6), the very trance-y ""Cosmic"" (#7), and the high-energy ""Silent Wishes"" (#10). The other tracks are disappointing, especially since many of them don't even sound vaguely like trance music. Track 1, for example, sounds like a theme song for some low-budget spy movie, and track 11 is a lame attempt at drums-and-bass. Overall I suppose it's worth the purchase for the good tracks, but be warned you'll only ever want to listen to four or five tracks on this whole CD."
4,star-studded trance performance,"in short, this is a quality cd that is worth my time to review it. Sasha and others are among the few that have awesome tracks with different sounds and a trance journey that is like no other. Digital Empire does it again."
4,Great Trance album,I got this for $3.00 and it was totally worth it. It has a small variety of trance. One of my favorites.
2,Blander than a lettuce sandwich,"I can't say anything particularly good about this CD. Robert Miles' Children is good, as always, but I sure as hell wouldn't buy this CD just for that song. This CD is lots of endless beats with a serious lack of climax. Booooring!!"
2,Wheres the hype?,"Theres only one description for this CD...""boring"" The only time I felt the music in this CD was when I finally heard the song ""Children."" The rest of the time I was waiting for a climax or something that stands out from the continuous repeating beats and tunes. This is definitly a CD that you will not get into. It was very plain and lacked originality."

3,Okay album by a GREAT band,"Walking with Thee is a great album, don't get me wrong. It's just that ""Internal Wrangler"" was so individual and I can honestly say that it sounds like no other band out there. But, Walking With Thee, their major label debut, sounds like they are trying to pull off the whole played out Radiohead thing. I like Radiohead too, but I don't want Clinic to try and sound like them. Clinic's strengths are in their ability to fuse that classic garage rock sound with an early 80's post punk art sound and even some Phil Spectre. Their strengths are not in this more modern, slick and produced sound they are doing. Clinic would be way better off if Radiohead had never existed. They also seemed like they had a lot more fun making the previous album. I do love the single ""Walking With Thee"", though."
4,Opposites Attract,"Contrasts can be beautiful, as Clinic prove on their new album. Captured between the sincere, longing vocals and the haunting malevolence of their music, Clinic has materialized true angst. Their sound, which employs smooth, subtle hooks and the entire spectrum of music (synth, harmonica, fuzz and surf guitar, Afro-percussion, etc.), is at once hopeful and despondent... uplifting and cautionary. A perfect soundtrack to these early, uncertain days of the 21st Century. One word of advice, though: lose the masks, guys. You don't need the gimmick anymore."
4,pretty good but....,"I like the whiny sound, so this is great and dark and wonderful....but is it just me or are ""harmony"" and ""come into our room"" almost the exact same song? They are both great songs--but the SAME great song."
4,Let it Sink In,"On first listen, this CD can be a little jarring. Yeah, here is some good guitar work and, what's this, a bagpipe? Then a harmonica? Obscure lyrics, understated, tension-ridden vocals ... sounds like a clarinet on another track, great keyboards & piano too. Jeez, this is different sounding stuff. But you know what? These guys are actually playing musical instruments - together - more or less at the same time. Wow. No digital perfection. Just straight ahead rock & roll with great hooks and heartfelt, albeit angst-ridden, vocals (the mostly indecipherable lyrics, for me, add to the mystique). No monster guitar wall of sound -- just catchy melodies & muscular bass set up by a chorus of harmonica wails, woodwind solos, and jangling keyboards. There's not a single weak track on this CD. The slower tracks (1, 6, 11) are melodically pure, truly heartfelt. This CD is a keeper; these tunes will echo in your head all day long. For me, I need a Clinic fix, and I NEED IT NOW."
5,the best group to come out of Liverpool since the Beatles,"If Clinic puts out another album as good as this one, I'll be calling the Beatles the 2nd best band ever to come out of Liverpool. By what is really an insignificant margin, I don't think this disc is as good as Internal Wrangler. What's with the increased reliance on dance beats? I, for one, was depending on Clinic to lead Brit pop music away from its by now tiresome dance music monomania. But in the great scheme of things, these are but petty little complaints. This is an absolutlely essential disc. In a just world, ""Welcome"" would be #1 on all the world's singles charts by now. By the way, is it just me, or can anybody else hear more than just a little of that Motorhead track ""Ace of Spades"" on ""Welcome""?"
4,Pretty Good Disc - Silver Apples,It is ridiculous how much this band sounds like the Silver Apples... and not just this album either... all of them... so I can't really consider this music as something altogether new. It is a good listen nonetheless.
4,Radiohead's Favorite Group,"Radiohead's favorite group start their second CD with the lonesome strains of harmonium and a seeming contradiction. ""I believe in harmony,"" are the first words Ade Blackburn states on Clinic's Walking with Thee, and he means it. The bad-trip psychedelica of Internal Wrangler is replaced by a bouncy electro-rock fusion that suits the optimistic mood of these new tunes. Their happiness is slight, as was their misery, though their cheery, dub-inflected rhythms buoy you along for the ride. If early-PIL mated with Bow Wow Wow, they might sound like this."
3,Slight Sophmore Slump But Still Good.,"Here we have yet another album which deserves that ever so important three and half rating. Compared to any other Clinic release, it pales in comparison but, when compared to alot of new ""indie"" music, it is a gem. The quartet is clearly looking for a way to expand their sound but not willing to give up the advances made earlier. So while not as incendiary as Internal Wrangler (THE place to start), it is not an embarassment to what Clinic has built. This is where you go after you have digested everything else. It is solid and makes one very curious about what the forthcoming Winchester Cathedral will be like. I can see the introspective moments growing but as long as they do them so well and include a few barnburners (or pub burners if you insist), I will continue to follow this intriguing rock unit."
5,if your looking for something alive and different,"if your looking for something alive and different, get this music........it will awake all that has been asleep, if you stop and listen. Clinic will provide."
2,All downhill from here,"Sheesh, this band doesn't just rip off the VU more than the Jesus and Mary Chain ever did- they take it ALL from one VU album.It's galling to me how this band doesn't even seem to have a clue how to appropriate their influences - there is nothing here but pure regurgitation, and they've been doing it for SEVEN YEARS without the slightest change up!"
2,Clinic Live,"Clinic's studio material is not bad, but their live shows are quite poor. Just saw the show last night, and the set was only 25 minutes."
4,just what is this?,"They sound like a mix of Velvet Underground and Frank Zappa's ""Freak Out"". Clinic has one of the most original sounds going today- by far. There's no middle ground here, you will either love or hate this album. I just happen to fall into the former."
3,Best of the series,"My toddler LOVES Spot. This is the only reason we watch this video. It's production quality pales in comparison to other kids videos and the stories are slow and completely devoid of educational value. But of the group of Spot videos this is the best one. If you toddler MUST have a daily dose of Spot, this is your best bet."
4,A series worth reading,"I'm a big fan of Bernard Cornwell, and found this series very satisfying. I count on his books for their historical detail, great characters, insights into human nature and page-turning action. Some thoughts on reading this book: No betrayals sting harder than when we're betrayed by our friends. No gift is greater than being forgiven when we least deserve it. No greater crimes are committed than those that are committed in God's name."
4,Almost as good as the Sharpe Series,"The Grail Series (Archer's Tale, Vagabond and Heretic) were great fun to read.Maybe comparisons to the Sharpe Series is unfair - in my opinion they and O'Brien's Aubrey/Maturin Series are the best historical fiction out there.Having said that, these 3 books were up to Cornwell's standards and did the time period and characterization justice."
3,heretic,"Quite as good as other novels of the same author, the story is dripping blood at every page.It depicts accurately a most cruel era.While historic picture is correct,there is only one mistake,one of the carachters is a cardinal archbishop of Livorno,(leghorn).Livorno at the times of the novel was a small village near Pisa,of less than 500 souls,under the Genoese rule.in 1601 became a duty free port,under the Grand Duke of Tuscany,and was inhabited by many protestant and jewish merchants,.The town obtained a catholic bishop only in 1806.I consider the Sharpe's serie and the American Civil War novels the masterpieces of Bernard Cornwell"
5,exciting,"The last of a trilogy, the ""Heretic"", was a fitting end to this series... enjoyable and exciting to the end!"
4,Vintage Cornwell (but read previous books first),"This is a great book and an enjoyable read. One point that should be made up front is that it is definetly part 3 of an on-going story and if you have not read the Archers Tale or Vagabond then you are not going to get the most from the story. The plot line is rather involved and Cornwell does not spend much verbiage on a recap. Also if you are a fan of the Sharpe novels (as I am) it is not long before you start seeing the similarities (ex: Sharpe with faithful Irish sidekick Sgt. Harper, Thomas with faithful Scots sidekick Robbie Douglas). This however is a minor quibble, Cornwell is a master at blending history and a good yarn into a seamless enjoyable package."
4,Of the latest Cornwell efforts this one is the best,"I've been a fan of Bernard Cornwell since the Sharpe series appeared in the States. As of late I've found the Sharpe series repetitious post-Waterloo. But this latest effort by Cornwell brings back the frailties and strengths of being a soldier using ""quaint"" weaponry. The battles scenes,as always, written with taut naration but full and richly detailed. This latest is one of the better ones yet I found Vagabond to be the better of the three so far."
3,"Grail Quest series ends not exactly with a whimper, but definitely not with a bang.","Heretic, like the first two stories in the Grail Quest series, was equally historically believable. That means a lot to history buffs like me. Once again, the hero faces evil nobles and suffers incredibly. This time, however, the events that Mr. Cromwell puts the him through are not as believable as all that. In addition to many things, like the savvy Jewish doctor being in the right place at the right time, for instance, is just a little too unlikely. Again, events in the story are possible, remotely, but Mr. Cromwell stretches credulity.I enjoyed the historical elements, and the depiction of the times was solid. If you've invested time and effort in the first two books of the series this one does wrap things up."
5,YEAH!!!,I loved this series. All the books were equally as good. This author is unbelieveable at describing chaotic medevil warfare battle scenes making them easy to read and vividly come alive in your readers mind.Get this entire series!
2,Suspect Motives,"The greatest impediment to enjoying a novel (for me) is when characters act in ways that don't make sense, thus poisoning the rationale for the story line. Even given the notable lack of self-control of Cornwell heroes when it comes to women, in this case the major plot line was Thomas abandoning his course for the woman. The only motivation offered for Thomas's attraction is her beauty. But there is absolutely no indication of any character lurking beneath the body! I haven't counted, but I doubt she has more than 30 words of dialogue in the entire book. For the hero to make a 90-degree behavioral turn for a woman, one has to understand the woman to understand why he would do so. Because there is no credible explanation, the book from a story perspective has to fail. I hasten to add that the historical accuracy, battle scenes, etc. are Cornwell's normal high quality."
2,Boring carnage? It is possible.,"As I wrote in my review of The Archer's Tale, I was very disappointed in the way this series fizzled out in this, the third installment.Bernard Cornwell was one of my favoriteauthors up until ""Sharpe's Waterloo"", but I feel he's again showingsymptoms of being too prolific.I just don't feel it....."
3,You Can't Win Em All,"With the very fine ""The Last Kingdom"" and ""The Arthurian"" Series it was too much to hope for the same quality of story telling in ""The Grail"" series. While I dragged myself through the first two books,""The Archers Tale"" and ""The Vagabond"", the ""Heretic"" was a welcome relief. Thomas finally revealed some character strength ( I loved the final pages with Guy)and the story came alive where the first two books didn't."
3,Fair conclusion to the Grail Series,"First off: This is book 3 in the series. Go back and read the first two if you aren't starting here.While you could jump into this book without the first two, you really lose the full effect without it.Also, the first two books are better while the third wraps everything up, with a somewhat ""standard"" Grail story.However a full review is probably silly, because either you read the first two -- and all you want to know if the 3rd one stinks -- and it is an OK book, so I wasn't disappointed reading it since it closed the series. As another review mentioned there is an interesting epilogue to the book.And if you *haven't* read the first two, start there."

1,can NOT boot mac os x==no good for backups,"If you are an OS X user, and want to make a bootable backup copy of your hard drive, do not buy this drive. (...)Don't make the same mistake I did-I didn't return it immediately, because I thought I was doing something wrong, I didn't imagine that any firewire hard drive would be screwy enough to not allow booting from OS X. Aaargh. Now it's too late to return it, and I'm stuck with a USELESS hard drive."
1,Disappointing after all this time,"I've had this for about 2 years now with no problems... then two weeks ago (with no hardware/software changes), I starting getting 'Windows - delayed write failed' errors on the drive when playing music via Windows Media Player. It is connected to my XP system via USB 2.0 and has about 20.5 GB used (mostly music). Now these errors seem to occur at random.As far as I can figure, it might have to do with the amount of data on it, but with only 20.5 GB used (out of 160) doesn't seem likely.I really don't have time to goof around with this -- so I bought a Seagate external 160GB HD (USB 2.0), but am unable to even copy data from the Iogear drive to the new one. I am going to try deleting all the non-music files from it and see if I can at least avoid having to reload everything onto the new drive. Good thing I only used the Iogear drive for temporary back-ups... if the data had been important I would be in trouble!"
2,POOR quality,"Mine just sputtered and died. It's four months old. Started really using it a week ago. Enough said. Frankly, this seems par for the course as far as these external drives go. Seems like one-in-ten go up in smoke within weeks of use. Don't put anything on these drives you might care to never see again."
4,The soundtrack we should have had 20+ years ago.,"I often wonder what goes through the minds of marketers or producers when they release a product that's half baked. What do they say or contemplate to themselves? Something like, ""Aw, who cares about all that other stuff anyway?"" or ""Screw 'em, they're lucky to be getting this!"" or ""Heh, I simply don't care.""Whichever, this is the beautiful music to a very entetaining film that we should have had many years ago, but are only now getting after two and a half plus decades?Oh well. Just be glad you have it."
4,Classic Indy,"Excellent to see this old favourite.I was happy to see this at a good price and had the award winning music from Composer John Williams, who is the master when it comes to film scores. I had this on tape before and since Technology has moved on I thought it was about time I replaced the tape with this polished version on CD."
5,Lost Train of Thought,Great artist! I woud recomend this to all music lovers. Ray Wylie Hubard where have you been all my life?
5,Yoga now part of English language,"Yoga is interconnected with the Hindu religion and and philosophy, and a Yogi is a person who practices that. These are lectures Swami Abhedananda (1866- 1939) gave in America. The chapters are: (1) Introductory (2) What is Yoga (3) Hatha Yoga (4) Raja Yoga (5) Karma Yoga (6) Bhakti Yoga (7) Jnana Yoga (8) Science of Breathing and (9) Was Christ a Yogi.A major theme that runs through the author's writings and lectures is that knowledge, whether it is science, philosophy or psychology, has to have utility and must be practical otherwise they are useless. Yoga then has to be studied, learned and practised. Keen students should read the Swami's Yoga Psychology and True Psychology. Both are more technical than those lectures of his famous brother monk Swami Vivekananda (1863- 1902). Swami Abhedananda came to America at his request and met many of the famous western intellectuals of that day, Max Mueller, such as Paul Deussen, and William James."
3,Confusing and blah,I am a long time fan of Ms Coulter's all the way back to her early medieval novels. One of my favorite novels is the Sherbrook Bride and I am not a fan of her FBI thrillers so I was excited to see her revisit the Sherbrooks. The first part of the novel I found myself totally getting confused as to the point of conversations and who was speaking. Ms Coulter has a talent for writing whitty conversations but this was over the top. An example of taking a good thing way too far. Every character seemed to have to throw a whitty remark into every sentence it quickly got confusing and annoying. The story is mildly interesting and has it's moments but obviously a set up for that $20+ hard cover novel about the second twin.
2,Blech...,"I genuinely enjoyed the story of Alexandra and Douglas Sherbrooke's stormy relationship, and how the finally settled into a decent couple. So it came as a complete shock to find that the qualities that drew me to them (their tempestuousness, spark and vigor) were completely devoid in this novel. Their children were equally as tepid; the only calling cards were their handsome good looks, which we were constantly reminded of. For every good Coulter book, there is an equally bad selection, and unfortunately this is one of the bad ones. On the plus side, it does set up the potential for a good Coulter book to come next."
2,Really bad material from an excellent author,"I couldn't believe how much I disliked this book. I gave it two stars just because Coulter is such a usually fine author. However, she missed the boat on this one. I read about 100 pages (or less) at the beginning and maybe about 30 pages at the end just to get my money's worth."
2,Read it Instead,"I've only listened through the 3rd CD and I can't seem to get into the story. I don't know yet if its the story line or Ms. Flosnik's grating voice. But her voice interpretation for James, Jason and Douglas (and all the men) make them sound ridiculous. Ms. Flosnik (as well as all female readers) should not try to sound like men -- just read it straight. I think I'd rather read this one. I don't recommend the sound recording."
1,Sorry excuse for a Sherbrooke Book,"This book was so boring. I was very, very disappointed. The relationship between the twin (what's his name) and Corrie seemed almost incestuous. She was more like a kid sister to them. I never, ever saw the relationship and the passion grow or ignite between these two. Waste of time. Catherine Coulter played her readers with this mess. She could have had more respect for us than to put this book out there."
5,One of Catherine's Best,"Very cute book. I've been looking forward to the Sherbrooke twins' story and Ms. Coulter does not disappoint. She does a lovely job of breaking the romance rules while keeping the story light, sweet, funny, and satisfying. CANNOT wait until the next one. Within the limitiations of the genre, this is one of the better romances I have read."
2,Only persistence kept me reading this one.,"This is the story of James and Jason Sherbrooke, loving twin sons of Alexandra/Douglas book. They are too beautiful by far ...and the reader certainly tires of hearing over and over how beautiful they are...and are steering clear of the marriage trap. Suddenly they are involved in protecting their father from an assassin and everyone joins together to this goal. The story line is weak and for some reason the characters never really come alive. They're ""nice guys"" and a nice family but the characters never grab you. The writing is very stiff and what little romance is in this isn't very inspiring. Certainly the 2 sex scenes are not impressive. Basically, don't bother with this one. In fact I think I'll be slower to pick out CC's bks in the future."
3,Not bad,"These books are not a bad way to pass the time. They are well written & there is enough mystery to keep you going. Sometimes they can be silly, but if you like soap opera's you'll enjoy these books."
2,Not one of her best works,"There is not much danger to Corriander (Corrie), the love interest of the first-born twin. And not much show of possessiveness, jealousy, nor romance between the two. No sign of pain nor struggle when apart. Just a flat ""love"" story. And surprisingly, how it is titled, the Sherbrooke Twins, would suggest to readers that both the twins would find love. Unfortunately, only one does and its James. I think the author started out wrong with naming it the Sherbrooke twins and should have a book title more fitting for James and Corrie's story and not get too focused on the part of the sons being twins."
3,An average romance,"This is another example of a ""family"" of romance novels, one I got sucked into long ago. So, when I saw the latest book I just had to buy it. I enjoyed it, as far as a light, fluffy read goes - this one supposedly had a bit of a mystery to it, but it was pretty easy to figure out - especially if you know the cardinal rules of romance novels. All in all, a pleasant way to spend a Sunday afternoon!"
2,Not her best,I have read all of her romance novels and have to say this is not her best. It is good in parts but others aren't worth reading. The ending was so sad that I cried for Jason and was so hoping for a better story for him in the next book in the Sherbrooke saga.
3,A toss up,"The Sherbrooke Twinsby Catherine CoulterReviewer: Pamela Ackerson, author of Home of the Braves trilogyI never thought I would see the day when I read a book by Catherine Coulter and was disappointed. The first 20 or so pages was great and then the book draaaaaaagggged. I almost didn't bother to finish reading it. In my head I kept thinking, this is Catherine Coulter it has to get better than this. So I read on and fought my way through the center of the book and zing! About three-quarters of the way through the book, There she was! I knew Ms. Coulter would show her head and writing expertise! The last quarter of the book, woohoo. That's what I was expecting. A great read. Was it worth reading through the slow part of the book? Yeup."
5,Old Timer's Repair Bible means Resurection to Perfection,"I have been using Chilton's Auto Repair Manuals my whole life. Both as a 'Novice' and a 'Professional' and can say that the attention to detail placed into the Chilton's Manuals are impeccable. Even though I work in a different field here in Europe, I still had the opportunity to pull out my Collector's Edition and work on restoring a 1971 Plymouth GTX that belongs to a co-worker. Step by Step outlines, factory tolerances and exploded diagrams aid in making a simple repair to a complicated restore seem like 'childs play'. Got a repair? Got a favorite car to restore? Got a Chilton's? If the answer is yes to these questions...then go for it!"
2,Not detailed enough,"When I searched for the specific book that I wanted, this book popped up. It is a overall good book, but not what I need. I did ask the seller a question about it, but since they are a volume dealer, they could not answer my specific questions about it. I took a chance and lost out, suppose it is the fault of both parties, the buyer and seller. I wish sellers knew what they were selling :)"
1,i know the truth cd,"I was NOT impressed with this cd. I like her older music so i assumed i would like this one as well. To my shock and disappointment, the first song on the cd was some hip hop type music with Tonex who i'm not a fan of. Ms. Cesear has put one foot into the world and one foot with God and in my eyes is between 2 opinions with this CD. I think hip hop belongs in the world and has no place in gospel. I was disppointed with Shirley Cesar on this one! Would not reccomend."
3,Christmas Shopping,"I purchased this CD as a Christmas gift for a friend who is a big Shirley Caesar fan. She is very pleased with the music. I bought one for me, as well. Haven't listened to my copy yet, but I liked the songs I heard when I previewed the CD prior to purchase."
2,A Lotta the Same,"I love a loose rock group as much as the next guy. Probably more. With their debut Hot Printz, Australia's Bumblebeez 81 are so loose they're slack. But lazy is another story. Most of these 14 songs and/or fragments are based around a good beat, fuzz guitar, raspy vocals, and occasional rapping. It's akin to backporch alternative. Singer Chris Colonna even sounds like grandpa with his teeth out. And it's intermittently fun. ""Pony Ride"", the single, is genius/stupid with its chorus of ""come on ride the pony gotta get it up"". ""Come Ova"" is a cute Pixies rip. Otherwise, the rap is lame. The playing is amateur. And the songs kinda sound the same."
2,Hunting al Qaeda,"I can appreciate the frustration National Guardmen have being labeled ""summer help"", however, during war everyone has a job and everyone does their job. True, politics interferes with the job our soldiers were sent to do. But Beast 85 put themselves in unnecessary danger, and because they did not follow procedure, the Taliban leaders were released. I admire their courage. I am grateful they worked diligently to find these masters of death. I am dissappointed they felt they had to do so by putting themselves in danger with the result of these leaders being released. A wonderful story of adventure to be sure. But was the adventure inspired by an erroneous label placed on our national guardsmen, or too many chiefs and not enough indians?"
1,Disappointing,"The book was short on action and long on complaining about their treatment by the Army. I highly respect the men and women serving in the military, but if they wish to write a book about their experience, they should not overkill their complaining and stick to discussing what they indicated the book would be about."
1,They really never fired a shot,"If you read this book carefully, the authors of this book never fired a shot in combat. They deployed. They whined. They complained. They cheated their publisher and those who helped them put this book together out of money. But they really just sat around and did nothing.And the book ended up doing what it was predicted to do from the start. Nothing.Good riddance."
3,Copy protected CD / can not upload to portable player,"Great music all around. But if you plan on uploading this CD to your portable music player, skip the CD buying and head over to an online music store instead. You will not be able to encode this CD into any format compatible with any portable devices, if you care just a tiny bit about sound quality.The only way you can ""rip"" this CD to mp3, wma or aac is in analog mode, and that results in a lot of backgrouund hiss noise. Windows Media Player, iTunes, RealPlayer all have problems with the digital playback of this CD. The only thing that kind of works for playback is a stupid, illegible, featureless, orange icons on blue background player that is included on the data track. Too bad..."
5,Wonderfull!!,Govi keeps his track record perfect with Saffron and Silk. All the tracks are a pleasure to hear given anytime of the day. Some of the tracks are very romatic too.
1,Received 5.25 inch enclosure without a fan.,"Seller sent generic 5.25 inch box with no fan. Waste of my time and money. Will have to wait for refund for days, weeks, or months so I can get the one I need from another seller. Don't waste your time with this seller. I believe the act of sending the wrong unit was malicious and intentional in order to cop excessive profit. Beware."
3,Good fun,"A very of-the-moment book on contemporary gay culture that encompasses a broad range of trends and fads. Tongue in cheek (like the cover model, literally) but also serious minded enough. Perhaps the only flaw of the book is the editor Richard Andreoli using this book to constantly remind us how hot he is. (He tries a gig as a go-go boy, with pictures, he talks about being admired by a group of men as he tries on a sexy swimsuit, he lets us know that Jennifer Garner complimented him on his bicep.) Richard, you are very handsome and look great but your constant need for affirmation shows that apparently the self-esteem has yet to catch up with him, and inadvertently showcases the less savory side of the gay world's oobsession with looks. Other than that, the book is lightweight, but good, fun."
5,Humble Pie on Sunset Strip,"For sure, when this was recorded in 1969, this was a group still trying to find a direction. They weren't yet the live powerhouse they would become a couple of years later. However, the talent within the group, Steve Marriott, Peter Frampton and Greg Ridley shines out throughout this charming live recording.Hallelujah I Love Her So and I Walk on Gilded Splinters are embryonic. Shakey Jake was a wonderful early single, while For Your Love and Shakin' All Over are clever creative cover versions.Great music, great sound quality. transport yourself back to 1969"
1,selective truth,"I bought this book after I read Whatever Happened to Penny Candy, hoping to supplement our homeschool history program. I decided to read it first to my husband, a Lt Col in the USAF (with tactical experience in both Gulf Wars), to see what he thought of it first. Honestly, we couldn't finish it. While Richard Maybury brings out some good points about historical events - things you don't hear often- he also leaves out a deal. He says up front he has a bias, but my husband considered the book biased to the point of dishonest propaganda - something Maybury says the US Government has used almost since day one. He's entitled to his opinion, but his ideas about how the country should be run are simplistic to the point of absurdity, and, my husband says, completely unworkable in this day of airplanes, missiles, and dirty bombs.Maybury should stick to economics. I cannot recommend this book."
4,Little Jimmy Scott/1,"I've been a fan for many years, and built a very good selection of his tunes to save. I look forward to seeing him perform live."
3,Milestone Profiles - Little Jimmy Scott: Not Quite A Milestone,"There are memorable cuts on this CD that I did not have on other CD's that I own by Mr. Scott, however, the overall compilation is not as strong as earlier releases. Also, the bonus CD was a disappointment as only one cut features Little Jimmy Scott."
3,Only the beginning,"The layouts are beautiful, the Weeping Gorilla idea is great and darkly funny, and Promethea is even somewhat interesting except that the long prose foreword is repeated graphically in the first issue or two. My biggest problem is that 12 bucks and 6 comics later not much has really happened - it's like reading the first 3 chapters of a 400 page novel. So if you're looking for any kind of closure - it's not here. I picture myself reading _Promethea Book 12_ two or three years from now saying, ""She *finally* understands her destiny and her powers.""I would recommend waiting for a compiled version or at least waiting for book 3 to come out so you can feel like you read and finished a book rather than just sampled it."
2,"Not a bad comic, but not good for Moore","I will be the FIRST to rave all over Moore's work on Vendetta, Watchmen and Batman. They are brilliant and redefined my world.But I tell you true that Promethea reads like someone who can't write trying hard to sound like Neil Gaiman while revamping an old superhero. Don't waste your money on this one. Maybe once Alan has time to season the heroine."
4,Philosphy meets the 4 color world,"Philosphy as the setting for the drama of a comic book? Or is that the other way around: a comic book as a setting for philosphy. Either way it's different and it's interesting.Alan Moore underpins his drama with timeless philosphy and well researched metaphysics. As long as he can maintain the drama in this complicated form he'll be fine.The characters are intriguing and touching, with a degree of surreal clarity that grabs hold and won't let go.Unfortunately this collection has the first 6 issues but the initial story arc doesn't climax until issue 8 where events are resolved and it prepares to pick up again.Allow me to mention the high marks for the book's excellent production values: good paper and color printing, excellent binding, solid construction."
2,Moore's not on top of his game,"Readers who know Neil Gaiman's Sandman universe will find a lot of familiar territory in the world of Promethea. Like the Sandman saga, we find a narrative set on the liminal landscape between the psychic realm and the material realm. Here we have the ""Immateria"" instead of the Dreaming. Also like the Sandman, the premise becomes a vehicle for exploring both worlds and their intersection. Unlike the Sandman, the chronicles of Promethea are flat, dry, two-dimensional, and predictable. A lot of superhero-style action will disappoint readers looking for the sophisticated antiheroes of Watchmen or the visionary storytelling of From Hell. I recommend that new Moore readers look to those works instead."
3,Add it up,This bundle is NOT a good deal at $67 as if you buy them sepate the total is $59.Way to go Amazon!
2,He's oversinging and skidding on the high notes,"I can believe what Voice Lover said: that this guy has a good voice on other recordings. But this is not a good performance: he is oversinging and you can hear the stress in his voice on all the high notes. I am a tenor myself, though not an operatic tenor, and it gave me pain to listen to this. (My ideal tenor voice, the one I envy the most, is Jussi Bjoerling.)"
1,horrible album,"Giordani can be excellent in the theater, but this album seems to have caught him at a bad time. He always seems to be changing gears during his performances here. He seems to have several voices in each register and you don't know from one minute to the next what you are going to get. I found this album to be a very unpleasant listening experience and think it was a mistake for Giordani to let Naxos issue it.If you want to hear a better performance by Giordani, pick up a copy of Verdi's Jerusalem on Philips which catches him in much better vocal estate."
4,"Some assembly/stabilty issues, but impressive model nonetheless","Sammy is a pretty hefty chunk of solid, unbending plastic, and you're supposed to balance him on a 1-and-a-half inch metal spike that sticks out the bottom of one foot---to simulate that cute little hop he does, right before a homerun lap. Problem is, the lightweight base has a very shallow hole to receive said metal spike, so Sammy's body tends to lean heavily atop the shallowly-anchored spike once assembled on the base. You have to position him carefully, to avoid the whole model just toppling over. Also, carefully concealed in the box is a short black plastic rod which is necessary to mount the bat to the base. The rod barely fit the too-small hole the on the bat, causing some restrained cursing during the build process. Once assembled, I must say it's a surprisingly lifelike and detailed model that does not disappoint."
4,they wrinkle-but are very very nice!,"I read all the reviews on the duvet and sheet set of this brand. Alot of them were complaining that these sheets wrinkle. Yes, they do after all, they are cotton! But, they are very very nice. I washed them before putting them on my bed. My matress is 17"" thick and the fitted sheet fits my matress perfectly and it doesnt try to come off. When I took them out of the dryer, I quickly put them on my bed. Everytime I put the fitted sheet (or the sheet, pillow cases, etc) on my bed, I sprayed them with a wrinkle releaser and smoothed them out with my hand. Almost all of the wrinkles came out and they smell great! You can make your own wrinkle releaser-its 1/3 fabric softener and 2/3 water. Put those in a spray bottle and shake it up before using it!"
3,Elastic broke when first used,"The sheets look fine, but the elastic broke when I first put them on the bed."
4,Pleased with this duvet cover,"Cotton is soft, but does wrinkle after washing. I have seen others that were much more expensive of similar quality. Overall a good value for a low price."
3,It pilled up after washing it and now it isn't as comfy...,"This was a good price but now I wish I wouldn't have wasted my money. It looks nice but after washing it it pilled up and is itchy. When I first got it, it was smooth and cozy. Now I don't even use it cause it is scratchy. Bummer..."
2,Light Treat for Horror Fans,"Have you time to thrill? Check-out Mental Scars on DVD. This B-movie, this cinematic junkfood (set in a junkyard) offers all the goodies: gore, violence, salty dialogue, tacky make-up, semi-messy plot, semi-stale acting, and T&A. Add popcorn and beer to your viewing. Simply, the film should appeal to horror fans. Especially fans who appreciate admirable, skillful creativity exercised within certain budget constraints. I liked it."
4,One Scary Monster...,"Last night I watched Mental Scars. I didn't know what to expect, other than that people would die in various bloody and scary ways. And I wasn't disappointed. They died, all right, in all kinds of imaginative ways.I was curious to see how well a music composer did as a villain. Richard Myles did a great job. He makes one creepy, yet sympathetic monster. If bad things hadn't happened to his character, if he hadn't been left on his own, would he have become such a creature? Or was he doomed from the start to become an instrument of revenge, because of a secret I won't divulge? And is he really the monster? Or is the monster the woman who wants to turn the junkyard into something else for her own profit?No spoilers here. Just let me say watching Mental Scars was a fun way to spend a couple of hours of my Friday night. Thanks, Viper Productions."
2,"Great Design, Extremely Poor Quality","We loved our Oxo Rotary Cheese Grater until it befell the same fate that many others have reported: the plastic ring at the bottom of the grater cracked and a piece fell off. If they could design it to last (such as simply eliminating the plastic ring on the grater barrel and making it one metal piece), I'd buy another."
2,"This Product Really ""Grated"" on My Nerves","Was hoping for a better product from OXO. Worked good at first, but after a couple months use it all began to crack and fall apart. Like so many warranted items, when the warranty period ends, it ends up breaking soon after. Really a waste of money. Don't bother!"
2,Good but fragile,"I had the same problem that others have written about: The plastic ring broke within about a month. It grated cheese well enough, but ended up being a waste of money."
1,Hard to hold.,My thumb joints hurt after I use this grater. It is hard to hold and to operate. Do not buy.
1,the handle broke!,"I didn't have this grater very long before the handle broke. Up until then I really liked it. I liked the tray to collect crumbs or for storing extra cheese. I just wish it was sturdier. I won't buy it again, the life span should be longer than one month!"
2,needs improvement,"The sponge tears off easy. Whenever I scrub in a circle or if the top egde of the sponge gets any pressure applied to it, the sponge twists off and soap dribbles out. I gave up on it after a bit.It looks good though..."
1,Piece of Junk,"...the head twists off if you apply even the smallest amount of presure. On top of that, the soap pours out when the head twists off, because this is where you fill the dispenser."
1,Don't bother,"I bought this product along with the Radio, Retail cd as well. This particular item came unwrapped and I was afraid to use it in my computer. The radio retail version came wrapped up but when I opened it, there was no cd in there! Very unhappy with this product!!! I thought Amazon had better products than this!"
1,Buyers Beware!,"I was very disappointed when I received my copy of the CD-Rom edition of The Industry Yellow Pages. First, the CD insert was very poorly printed to the point of being neary illegible. When I opened the case and removed the CD-Rom, I unhappily discovered that the label was not fully stuck on and the CD-Rom was actually a CDR. The whole thing looked to me like something very unprofessionally and shoddily home-made. Still, I reminded myself that what I had purchased it for was the information it contained and not its esthetic values. I went ahead and popped it in my computer and given its shabby appearance, I was hardly surprised when it did not function whatsoever. My system meets all the requirements for the CD. It simply was not properly made. I cannot comment on the information the CD might contain, because I was never able to get that far. This item seemed far below Amazon's usual standards and I can only say, thank goodness for their return policy!"
5,"wow, helpful","As a vivid cluber and party lover i have always been in need of a guide that will point always in the right direction : the best club, the places to be, descriptions and correct directions. Unfortunatly not too many titles of this kind are on the market but this one is the best. With full listings and an ever growing database of what's good and what's bad, completed by recomandations and filled out corectly, this title is a gold mine"
5,Don Camillo will pep you up to kick any rascals in humour,My home library contains some fabulous titles from Signor Guareschi. Over the years my wife and my brother and I have started guarding them with our lives. Particularly the above title. What a sublime humour and a bygone era. I went to Italy to see Palmar and the river Po. Made lot of Italian friends on that trip. Read Guareschi. Particularly the House that Nino Built.
3,Nice Wife Finishing First,"I enjoyed reading this book though it was a lot of reading to get to Ashley coming into herself and dealing with Marcus. Though I was sure of what the ending would be, I was glad things worked out for Ashely and Elliott. The author had so much telling information until I noticed that Ashley informed Elliott about her childhood and her brother while he was at her house as if she had not already told him the same story earlier in his office."
4,"Good slicer, cuts thick","Like other reviews said, this cuts pretty thick slices. It's good for cheese and crackers, and makes a nice clean cut. It's a nice addition to a kitchen like ours, which goes through a lot of cheese. I recommend it. The price is right."
3,Skip it and go for the newer model,"I own both this one and the newerOxo Good Grips Wire Cheese Slicer with Replaceable Wiresand there's no contest. Other reviews have it down. Though this one feels good in the hand, the wire stretches quickly (especially if you cut harder cheeses) and there's no way to re-tension it. Also it's not designed great for cleaning, making that a bit of a chore. The other OXO model mentioned is totally superior. Shop around, sometimes you can get it with 2 replacement wires instead of just 1."
3,"Thick, slack wire makes slicing harder than it should be","This slicer has a nice handle, like all OXO products. Unfortunately, you're going to need all the grip that handle can give you. The wire in the slicer is thicker than other slicers than I've used and is not mounted as tightly in the frame. This makes the slicer drag through the cheese and require more effort than slicing really should. It's not a bad slicer, but it's not nearly as joy-inducing as other Good Grips utensils I've used. (As for adjusting the thickness of the slices, just tilt the handle a little bit as you pull. It's not hard to get the hang of it.)"
1,"""cheesy"" slicer is more like it...","After using this for a couple of months, the wire has stretched and this slicer has become unusable. Save yourself the trouble and do what I ended up doing - go to Target and buy a nice, heavy slicer with adjustable width and screws to tighten the wire should it stretch. It will set you back less then 10 bucks. When I think of how many thousands of these slicers will end up in the garbage; OXO should be ashamed of themselves for creating a product like this."
1,Only lasted a few times...,I was very disappointed with this cheese slicer--the wire broke after about the fourth use. I have always had good experiences with Oxo and was very surprised.
2,Cheese slicer with a flaw,"As advertised, the grip on this cheese slicer looks more than adequate. However, I was very disappointed when I was not able to adjust the width of the head on the slicer. If you want to slice thin slices of cheese, this is not the cheese slicer for you. You will be able to slice only one width and it is a thick width."
1,Worst Slicer Ever,"We've never been anything but pleased with the OXO products we've purchased in the past. The garlic press, for example, is so sturdy it'll likely outlive us all. Unfortunately I bought this slicer in a store, not on Amazon where I'd have read the reviews and known better than to waste my money. It looks hearty enough to pound nails, but in our experience it was barely up to cutting cheese. We probably sliced three dozen pieces of Tillamook cheddar with this thing before that wire snapped like a cheap guitar string. The sad part of it is that you can replace a guitar string. You can't replace this wire. No screws. No way to adjust tension. Don't do what I did and assume it's worth the few extra bucks because it looks solid. Without the wire slicer it's just a cheese roller and I'm not sure what use anyone has for one of those."
1,Already broken,My cheese cutter has already broken. :-( Is there any way to get a replacement for it? I really liked it until it broke. :-(
2,Looks good... Doesn't last...,"Appears to be a quality product, but wire stretches after a few months. If it came with a dozen extra wires, it might be a good deal."
1,Wire Cheese Slicer wire broke -,"I bought this cheese slicer for my husband for Christmas. He had one that recently broke, that he had for several years.He opened it on Christmas Day, and the wire broke this morning, Saturday, January 5, 2013.Now, we have to replace it."
2,RIP OFF!!!,This is nice looking and well made . . . with one exception. The wires break after very little use. I have two of these and have used them no more than half a dozen times (on medium to soft cheeses) each when the cutter wires broke. The rip off is that the replacement wires by the manufaturer cost another $14.00 for just three wires. Somebody's making some money here: but they won't get any more of mine.MOD
1,cheap and cheezy,I used my cheese slicer about 3 times and the wire pulled out of one end. Don't buy this slicer!
1,choose something else,"I also had to throw mine in the trash. After several uses, the wire stretches to the point that it won't stay tight anymore. It slips off the side of the slicer and is perfectly useless. I normally love OXO products, but this one is a clear miss."
1,wire just snapped,I liked the slicer okay...but the wire just snapped and I haven't had it but a few months.
2,"Kind of flimsy, non-adjustable","The wire on this slicer is not adjustable, and I tend to prefer my slices a bit thinner than it does them, which is part of why I purchased a wire cheese slicer.The wire was getting pretty slack over the past couple of months, and then when I was slicing cheese today it just broke! The wire itself didn't break, but it pulled out from the handle and is non-repairable. The good news is, I called Oxo to inquire about warranty info., and they said that it's warrantied for life and would send me out a replacement right away. The whole call took about three minutes. Maybe the one that I got was just bad, maybe they're all like this and I'll just keep getting replacements. I wish I'd purchased another kind instead, though."
2,Fell apart on 1st use!,"I was really looking forward to the cheese slicer, as I've never had one before and I've used other OXO products. Unfortunately, this OXO grater fell apart the first time I used it."
1,Very Inadequate,This was not good at cutting firmer cheese such as sharp cheddar or swiss. After about the third slice of cutting some cheddar the wire broke. It is now in the landfill.
2,Fine while it worked,"It does the job while it works.. then the wire went slack and finally broke, like everyone else. I could call and get a replacement but do I want to bother? Perhaps I'll get a replacement and give it away as a gift to someone who will never use it. It does look very nice. Anyone have a recommendation for an alternative product?"
1,Broke in 3 months,"This is expensive and it broke in only 3 months of use. First the wire stretched, then finally it snapped. So, we went to the grocery store and picked up a really ""cheap"" one that lasted us 6 years."
3,"Don't buy this, buy the other one...","We bought this cheese slicer and, initially, were very satisfied with it. With moderate use, it lasted about 6 months until the wire stretched and about a year until it broke. I like the weight and feel of the OXO slicer, but it could have been more durable. This model CANNOT be fixed. OXO does sell a model that has an adjustable and REPLACEABLE wire. Next time, I would buy the other model (#1071567) along with some spare wires."
1,Poorly made,"After a few uses the wire stretches and then breaks. It is not repairable. Too bad, since they make other good products."
1,Pure Junk!!,"This slicer has no pros only cons. After washing the handle leaks water out of it all over the cheese (yuck!), it isn't adjustable and the slice is very thick. OXO has some good utensils this isn't one them. I am currently seeking a new cheese slicer and will be throwing this one in the trash can where it belongs!"
2,Wire very loose in only six weeks,"Bought this slicer 17May2011. The handle and head are great, good balance and appearance. The cutting wire has come loose and will soon break. It seems a bit odd to design and manufacture a product with such obvious quality in all areas except the most critical function. This slicer is not used on hard cheeses and only by people who have used this type of slicer previously. I'm seriously disappointed. Certainly not worth the purchase price."
2,"I like Oxo kitchen hand tools, but not this one...","Flimsier than most of their other items, and once the wire stretches, you're out of luck for fixing or modifying it. Basically it doesn't last long."
1,I should have listened,"I read the reviews but having so happily previously owned an OXO cheese slicer for a couple of years before it cracked and broke, I thought, ""How bad could it be?"" So now, 5 or 6 weeks later, the damned wire has broken, I'll have to figure out how to make good on the warranty, and I'll just be buying the cheapest one I can find at the big box. Where did OXO go so wrong? The ergonomics I love but this utensil is a loser."
1,cheese slicer,At first I liked this slicer but after just a few uses it broke and now is not usable.
1,not very happy with this,"We have had this for about a year and the wire broke. The bad part is that it is put together in a way that I can't fix it. I thought that maybe it would be a screw that I could loosen to put the wire back and then retighten, but no, it is welded or something so it goes in the garbage. Usually OXO makes good products but not this time."
1,Wire broke with 1st use,"The wire broke the first time we tried to slice cheese. We went back to the store and exchanged it for a new one. The wire broke again with the first attempt to slice cheese!! Very disappointing, especially since our previous slicer with a similar design lasted 30 years with almost daily use."
5,Supreme Listen,Just really getting into Jazz and I must say that this is a good listen. Smooth and the Sax definently plays with your senses and never lets your ears just sit on one note. Good listen will surely buy more of Mr. Joe Henderson.
5,Best Dancehall/Ragga/Raggamuffin compilation ever,"This cd did a perfect job at catching the sound of the time period, which in my opinion, is the time when dancehall sounded best. You should love this no matter what genre or style u prefer. It's full of hits that will be hits forever in my opinion and hopefully yours too."
1,Poor customer service,"I have no idea whether the product is any good, because I never received it. It took Webtreo several days to respond when I emailed them that the battery had not arrived by the end of the scheduled delivery period. They did say they would ship another battery. That second shipment never arrived. The first one did, finally, a couple of weeks later (I know it was the first one because of an ID number on the shipping label supplied by Webtreo after my original order). However, it was the wrong battery. The shipping list in the package had the right battery listed, but the battery did not fit my phone and information on the battery itself identified it as a different battery. Webtreo never responded to my email about sending the wrong battery. Amazon, however, did refund my money."
4,"""Crowhaven Farm""","My FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME, but unfortunately the movie is from 1970 and unable to be put on DVD well enough to clear up the image to pristine quality. NEVERTHELESS, I am in ecstasy that I have a copy of it at all!!!!"
3,PUT THE ABC MOVIE OF THE WEEK SERIES ON DVD!,"Enough already with these lame DVD-R releases that won't play in some DVD players. When is a company going to license the entire ABC Movie of the Week series and put it out in volumes on official DVD relases? Most all of those original ABC made for TV films were brilliant and well made and would hold up to today's viewers. So come on, someone please get with the ""program"" and give us those great ABC Movie Of The Week films that we remember so well from our youth, remastered and restored on official DVD's!"
1,Tedium Times Twenty,"I am an avid fan of all film in general and Japanese film in particular. I read a review of this book in the Japan Times and was excited by the nice things Donald Ritchie had to say about it. Apparently, he read a different book. This one is dry, dull, and reads like a jumped-up version of someone's dissertation."
5,You smell like pizz,"This movie was awesome. From Truck's enterence in the beginning, to his first meeting with sadistic pimp Gator. This was by far my favorite blaxploitation movie of all time, and I must say this will go down in history for myself as having an awesome soundtrack and some of the coolest lines in a movie ever!"
5,The best one I have seen so far of this genre!,I have to admit that this one is probably one of the best. I knew from the opener that I was hooked. Issac Hayes and Lt. Uhura kick butt and I find the diaglogue of all the characters in the movie to be very funny.
5,Issac Hayes Remembered,Mac Truck Turner Issac Hayes played the heck out of this movie as a skip tracer tracking down the bad guys. this is how i remember a man who brought great acting to the world as a whole.
4,Great accessories at a great price,This was purchased as a gift for my daughter for her new ipod. It comes with everything she needed and she loved the case. She will never be without her ipod again with the car charger and home charger. Great combo at a great price
1,Complicated,I did not like this carrier. I wish I had kept the box so I could retrun it. The straps dont stay put and to put your infant in the device takes an act of God. Front carrier is ok but back carrier requires the child to be laying down and sitting still. Two impossible request.
4,"Great, affordable carrier!","I bought this carrier (though in a different color) from an individual when my daughter outgrew her first infant carrier. It was the only carrier I could find that wasn't framed but still held a slightly larger child. My daughter was almost a year when I got it. We have a framed carrier as well, which is great for hiking, etc. But I like that I can put her in this one and run in the store without looking like I got lost mid-mountain trek. My daughter loves it and is very comfortable. It's a great deal, too, when you look at the prices of some of these things. You can usually find good carriers used as well, so check out resale shops. I haven't had a problem at all with the buckles but, of course, I always check them before I trust them to carry my little girl.Save money and get cash back when you shop online![...]"
5,School Daze!,"Great news! You just got accepted onto the best boarding school in te country. But when you see it. you finally feel creeped out. If you take Science, you might end up with a transmitter implanted on your arm!"
5,Well Worth The $$,"Very informative book with page after page of fascinating photographs. Well worth the money and a great addition to any porcelain, parian subject library."
5,great book,"I remembered liking Mercer Mayer's books when I was a kid and couldn't wait to get some for my son. He loves these books, they are a go-to for story time almost every night. We have a pretty good collection of the Little Critter stories at this point, but this continues to be one of the favorites."
2,price too high for what you get,book was flimsey and the price on the book was less than I paid pretty sure it was a used book whats up with that?
5,Good Read,I enjoy that this character is the same character I read about growing up. My children enjoy the pictures and I enjoy the lesson learned.Book RecommendedWang Mind the greatest of the great pandasHappy animalsAlaska's ABC Bears
1,Sorry,"The artistry is delightful, but I don't think I want my child to cherish a book where the mother often looks angry at the child and the child doesn't do what he is supposed to do because he just didn't want to. I wanted a sweet story for my child to go to bed with. This is not that story."
5,"Cute Book, Realistic Situations","In the beginning of Mayer's book, our hero looks straight at the reader, slightly lifts both arms, and states: ""Sometimes I remember, sometimes I just forget."" For example he (or she?-it's difficult to tell the gender in this ""Little Critter"" book) puts his dishes in the sink, but forgets to put away the milk. Humorous twists on the `I remembered this, but forgot this' motif lift this book above the ordinary. For example: ""I didn't forget to feed the goldfish, he just didn't look hungry,"" and, after a bath, ""I didn't use soap, but I didn't forget to. I just don't like to."" His mother is alternately tired, frustrated, and amused, and the clever story ends on a warm note. This is a sweet and simple story that manages to cover many familiar situations with honesty and empathy for all involved. Watch for the little mouse friend on every page!"
1,Dangerous,I could never get the hang of this gadget and I am a handy person. It has broken corks and pinched my fingers....looking for something better.
4,Close but not quite!,"I really like most of this corkscrew. It is a nice sturdy base and that makes it easy to leverage the cork out of the bottle, which is good since this is the reason I bought it. I had one that felt like it was bending every time you used it. The thing that I don't like about it is the foil cutter. I can't seem to line it up right to actually cut the foil or I don't seem to hold it hard enough. I have to get out a knife to cut the foil, or just pull the cork up through the foil."
2,Oxo Corkscrew,"Ok..I am used to the wing corkscrew.. Got this as an altenate..Forget it..would not work for the life of me..If you are mechanically inadept, this is not for you. Go with the wing, or the Rabbit! And, there is no way to remove foil with this screw.Totally diappointed."
4,"Holy Good Grips, Batman!","I almost purchased a metal waiter's corkscrew but am glad I waited to get this one. The large, rubberize handle is easier to hang on to and is much more comfortable to hold in your hand. The bottle opener and corkscrew are easy to pull open and to close -- they do not ""snap"" shut the way knife blades can. I like that the foil cutter is not a blade that is pulled open to stick way out from the handle but is a tiny blade protected by hard plastic that juts out just far enough to cut the foil from a bottle neck. I'm not a huge wine connoisseur but I believe this corkscrew does the job while being easy to use."
2,Good Grip - Too Short on Business End,"I've broken a few corks with this tool, as the ""worm"" doesn't reach the bottom of some corks. Other foil cutters are easier to use. Like most OXO tools, this one feels comnfortable and steady in the hand. If you're opening an older bottle or one that has a particularly long cork, use another corkscrew."
3,it's ok,Maybe we don't know what we are doing but it doesn't work properly had to go and pump my wheels to the gas station anyway ;/
2,"dull, unimaginative study of fascinating topic","Nelson's academic approach to the subject renders her treatment of exceptionally lively and fascinating subject matter dry, but fails to be insightful. Her style is pedestrian, sometimes pedantic. Jonathon Green's 'All Dressed Up: The Sixties and the Counter-culture'(1998) and 'Days in the Life: Voices of the British Underground, 1961-71'(1988), Nigel Fountain's 'Underground'(1988), Roger Hutchinson's 'High Sixties'(1992)and Richard Neville's 'Hippie Hippie Shake'(1995) are all so much better. Perhaps part of Nelson's problem is that she is based in Australia, remote from the scene she describes, whereas the authors I mention above were all protagonists in the London counter-culture."
1,ONLY ONE ROLL!!!!,BEWARE!!!! I ordered and only received ONE roll....that does not help much when machine requires TWO! Talked to customer service and they can't give me a straight answer yet. The internet said it comes with TWO ROLLS
1,False advertising!!!!,I too ordered this item thinking it was a 2 roll pack and received onlyone roll. Company did not bother to make good. Just told me to return it.
5,Blue Moon is the best of the Gibeon Lowry books.,"I've read all of John Leslie's series of detective stories set in Key West and involving the piano-playing sleuth Gideon Lowry, and the most recent one, Blue Moon, is the best of the lot. Lowry has a lot of old girl-friends, and spends a lot of time saving them in interesting ways. Blue Moon is very quick-paced, nuanced and almost gentle. Gideon flies to the mid-west, probing into the past of a man who is threatening the life of a lost love, and then comes back to Florida for an exciting conclusion. Lowry is the most believable private eye in the business. He seems to have the same aches and pains the rest of us suffer, but he still beats up bad guys when the occasion demands. I couldn't put it down."
5,sooooooo wonderful,"I got this at a crazy good price, so my judgment may be biased. Its wonderfully comfortable for starters. What I really like is that it has a lot of weight to it. When its over you, you really feel it. Warm, soft, and wonderful. Really, I've had it on my bed for longer than I remember now (well over a year. maybe two?) and I still love it..."
2,Rough blanket,"From reading other customer reviews, I thought that this blanket would be decently soft but it really isn't. It's like sleeping with cardboard. It is a good weight, however, it is irritating to my skin and I use it only as a blanket for my cat (even he doesn't prefer it. He would rather sleep directly on my comforter rather than on this blanket). I would not suggest buying this blanket. Save your money."
2,Winkie doesn't Wink!,"Well,I'm a big Temple fan and I certainly didn't totally hate this movie but I sure didn't totally love it. This movie may be good to someone who is interested in this kind of stuff but for an 11 year old girl who loves to see the dancing and singing Shirley this comes as quite a disapoitment.I read that this was Temple's favorite movie of hers. While I can't criticize her opinion I think she has done much better. Wee Willie Winkie doesn't even wink! Some ok parts but if you're a Shirley fan you probably would rather stick to doing something else."
3,Fine film. Too bad it's colorized.,"If you care about whether the film you are watching is in the original black and white or colorized, you won't get much help from the product description for this version of the film. Buyer beware."
3,"""The Peace-Maker!""","This Shirley Temple film is one of my least favorites and is not suitable for young children-they'll just be bored. Shirley doesn't dazzle her audience with her musical talents, which gives the movie a downside already. She plays a prim and proper English daughter named Pricilla living in India with her grandfather (a colonel) and mother on military grounds. She then decides she wants to be a member of her grandfather's army to make him proud of her. Her soldier name becomes Wee Willie Winke. The movie is very boring and very much drags it's story line. At the end, Shirley saves the world from war. Although the movie is dull, I must ammit Shirley is a very good actress in the movie. She is dramatic, sweet, and tough. The only reason ""Shirley lovers"" should buy this movie is to see her great display of acting talent."
1,Rubber Maid 1006 Blue Ice Soft Pack,"Bought two,each developed a leak in less then a month. Very disappointed in quality of merchandise.Quick delivery and well packaged."
2,LOOKING FOR SOETHING BETTER,"THIS WAS NOT AS GOOD AS I HAD HOPED. I LIVE IN THE CAPITAL OF NOWHERE GROCERY SHOPING IS 65 MILES, A GOOD GROCERY STORE IS 150 MILEM ONE WAY, SO COOLER CHEST WITH ICE PACK ARE A WAY OF LIFE, NOT IMPRESSED WITH THESE AT ALL"
1,Useless cookbook for families,"We don't all live by farmer's markets or in big cities. Too many ingredients (some hard to find in many places) and too long preparation time for stressed out families. I'm sorry Jamie, but I don't have time when I come home from work to crack open a coconut and shred it for fixing a sallad which, by the way, my family won't like. The amount of fat, especially saturated fat in the recipes is astounding. Fine for once a week, but for everyday? I was very disappointed in this cookbook, I'm sorry to say."
5,"Easy, REAL FOOD recipes for every day!!","I'm a big JO fan, and ordered this book from the amazon.co.uk site, so I've had it for a few weeks now. This is, by far, Jamie's best cookbook to date - the recipes are easy and nutritious without being too ""out there"" with weird ingredients (ie the beet cake in last book - yuck), there's a large section on how to make tasty foods that kids will eat, fantastic ideas for packed lunches... I'm very happy with this book. Three cheers to Jamie for giving us a cookbook that's actually USEFUL!!"
3,A bit disapointed...,"This is a gorgeous cookbook...to look at. The pictures and lay out are fantastic but I found the recipes to be a bit ""out there"". I was expecting awesome, easy , family recipes. I found maybe four or five recipes in the book that my family would eat. I mentioned the ""squahed fig, basil and parma ham sarnie in tomato bread"" to my husband and he just looked at me with a blank stare. I also doubt that my three year old will go near the ""Sweet Duck Legs Cooked With Plums and Star Anise"" but I will try some of the recipes.JO does provide an excellent chapter on vegies, how to select and prepare etc. Don't get me wrong, I will enjoy this book, I won't regret spending the money however it will not become the family cooking bible that I had hoped for."
5,Jamie Oliver - Jamie's Dinners,"You can never go wrong with Jamie,I own all of his books and this is my favorite. He makes the simplest ingredients come to life. Gives you a whole new perspective on english food."
5,Plane Song Soars!,"After having enjoyed sharing Train Song, by Diane Siebert, with both my toddler and my husband, I looked forward to reading Plane Song. Siebert delivers again with Plane Song! Words take flight in fanciful form, illustrating through language the poetry of planes in flight. The beautiful paintings by Vincent Nasta stir the imagination of readers young and old. Because of the perspective of each painting, the reader feels as if they are flying, too. From jet planes to bombers, fire-fighters to bush planes, crop dusters to ""rag bags,"" the lyrical sound of Siebert's words read aloud invites readers to ""spread their wings in flight."" Plane Song is an excellent choice for young readers or plane fanciers."
5,Planes,"Vincent Nasta was my art teacher in highschool. He was kind, smart, talented and very funny. I am a successful artist today because of the encouragement he have me in highschool, as well as the practical painting and photoshop skills he taught. In 2008 he died while flying a plane in an airshow [...]. I purchased this book after returning home from his wake, and when it arrived, I held it to my chest while crying uncontrollably for several hours. I liked to do this a few times a day for the entire mourning period. The shape of the book and its relative thinness made hugging it very easy, but unfortunatly I have barely gotten to enjoy the artwork as I haven't wanted to ruin the pages with the tears of an infinite sadness, since they are amazing paintings of planes."
3,"a bargain, yet a pity it's printed in b&w and","With a written essay to introduce the Blueberry Sage so far and a two-page bio of the writer and the artist respectively other than the additional 14-page story "" three black stones"", this paperback collection of Mr Moebius' masterpiece is a must-have for both new and die-hard fans alike. Yet the big drawback of this book is that it's considerably downsized to 7><9 inches and printed in B & W. So quite a lot of details are reduced to zero."
2,Not Worth The money!,"The video starts out ok,but then it get worst. The woman you see on the cover are the main woman throughout the DVD. It gets boring as you go on. The pro side of this DVD are the butts,which are great, but the con side of this DVD is you can tell it's amature made. The video does not give you much vartiey of woman at all. Unless, you consider five brazilan woman a varitey,which also grace the cover of the DVD. The only reason why I gave this DVD a 2 is because of the butts, other than that, it would have received a 1. This DVD was poorly done."
2,It is Interesting at least,"Wow! What a crappy show. This CD is only for completests, which I am afraid includes me. It was interesting to hear the singing voice of Maureen O'hara, but the music it self is basically just boring, and not even bad enough to laugh at. It sounds like a show written by an amateur for a little theatre group to put on."
5,Most comprehensive book ever,"Douglass North is an amazing writer. If you are purchasing this book, you probably already know what this book is about and its impact. This book, I would argue is largely responsible for his receiving the Nobel Prize in 1993.His new-institutionalist view links together history, economics, political science, sociology, and every other social science. This book truly inspired me to specialize in institutional economics. Every social issue can be approached from the institutional perspective, namely that institutions determine actions and the market determines institutions. Though my professors are all old institutionalists, they agree this is the best book by far on the subject and most research papers in the subject thus reference this book.For more information on New Institutional Social Science, visit the website at http://cniss.wustl.edu/people.html"
3,Abstract institutions,"I am a political science student and am used to the literature, but even I have to say this book gets pretty abstract. North makes some interesting points, but I feel it could have used a bit more focus. I felt like the chapters wandered and I never got the full impact of what he was trying to say. I was surprised because North's journal articles tend to be so insightful and focused. The book is probably worth reading once for institutionalist scholars as it does make the important point that transactions costs and other barriers prevent institutional change that might otherwise be efficient. However, the book could have made that point in a short article."
1,Did Not Buy This Item,"Some mistake somewhere, I did not buy this product! I did buy another product for my Hydrofloss machine but not this."
1,Made for a child or small woman,"This was the worst pair of jeans I have ever bought in my life. The specs implied that it would fit on one's waist, however with the crotch being so short it barely reached my hips. I normally wear waist size 31, which I ordered, but with this pair of jeans, the zipper almost could not go up. In addition, I am not a person with large legs, but this pair of jeans hugged me like it was made for a woman who wants to show off her assets. I would have returned my purchase, but where I am living it would cost double what the jeans are worth, so I will just have to accept my losses."
5,Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans,Levis 517 Boot Cut Jeans are just as advertized. Good fit and a perfect boot cut. I highly recommend them for anyone who needs boot cut jeans.
1,WANT TO RETURN,this pair of jeans did not fit as expected. THEY LOOK REALLY BAD ON ME. I would like to send them back.
2,wrong color,"I ordered stone washed jeans because I like the look and feel, I was sent regular blue jeans. Because I needed pants now not later I kept them but I'm not happy! As usual the jeans are good they are Levi's after all but NOT what I paid for. ARE YOU EITHER COLOR BLIND OR ILLITTERATE AT AMAZON NOW. M.S."
2,Way to long,"I had ordered Levis jeans before, and the sizes fits always perfect, in this case this jeans were suppose to be a 34 waist 30 long... but it looks like a 32 or 34 long."
2,"The ""rigid"" wash isnot a good wash!","I bought these jeans for my husband at Christmas. I knew that they would be stiff when I got them, and they were new so that is OK. But the first few times these have been washed, inside out or right-side out, they have faded and have horrible crease marks in the jeans, like the starch that was in them when they were new was just too much. I am disappointed in these jeans. After 6 washings they have weird lines on them and I cannot get them to go away. My advice, don't get the RIGID rinse.."
2,poor quality control,"ordered 32 inch length. first pair was 4"" too long. recieved a replacement pair and they were 2"" too long. poor quality control on this product"
3,denim does not seem as thick as previous orders,the quality of the denim seems to have degraded - denim from older amazon jean orders seem to have carried more weight.
5,Good looking with or without boots great fit for motorcycling,"Have had these jeans for a few weeks now & am very satisfied.The flair from the knee down is discrete and does not look like the 70's bell-bottoms. The fit on top was precisely as marked. The length seems about 1/2 inch longer than sized on the 501's.Was formerly utilizing 501 slim fit jeans but found that could not place them over motorcyle boots. The 501s were great for rainy rides, but look too much like a cowboy, when tucked into the boots."
2,Mrs,The pants are not true to size.Nor was it medium it was light color. They are too long. Not 36x29. More like 36x30May I return for exchange? The darker colorIndigo are true to size not stonewash.We are not satisfied with merchandise.Please send Return Label for exchange.Thank you.alfredawhtd@gmail.com
1,Sizing Was Way Off,"In the same order I purchased these and another pair of Levi's jeans, in a dfferent cut. Both pairs were ordered in the same size. The other pair fit fine, just like every other pair of jeans that I've ordered in this size. These jeans, however, were about three sizes too small. I double checked every tag just to make sure they weren't improperly labeled, but according to every tag and sticker on the jeans, they were the size I had ordered. Ever since my favorite cut of Levi's (569) have been changed, it's been hard to find a good pair of jeans. Thankfully Amazon offers free returns, back to the warehouse these go!"
3,Wrong Length,"I love Levi 517 boot cut jeans but when I order 36 x 30 thats what I expect.When they arrived they were at least 32"" length and I had to take them to a tailor to have them shortened so it made them very costly.What is your policy on quality control?Joseph Surwilo"
5,Friend's Jean of Choice,"I bought these as a gift for a friend who has worn this style for years. Good quality, good fit , good style."
5,Classic,"Great jeans.Classical style.Low price.Wearing only jeans, levis always loved.Happy New Year!Amazon Forever!I love it."
5,Great jeans,They are Levis what more needs to be said? Theyre the only jeans im buying from now on. They fit great and last 2-5 times longer than any other jeans ive bought.
5,Excellent,"Excellent product the product I come very well and it is what was waiting of, I come in time, good"
3,Well...,"I knew it was a slim design, but did not expect it to be that slim, especially in upper thigh area. I don't see much different than 527 boot cut jean. I was hoping it was more like the ones from the 70's look. But it is good enough. I will wear it and enjoy the style. Levis should come up with another model ie. 507 or 537 to be more loose fit with boot cut."
4,Nice jeans,Bought these jeans for my husband. They fit very well and look nice. The shipment arrived on time. I was happy with my purchase.
5,Levis review,"They fit just perfectly and I am very happy to not only get the bestdeal around but beat the sales tax. Good old Levi's rigid, bootcut jeans have been my all-time favorite jeans my whole life, andI just turned 60. Got 'em within a week, free shipping faster thanexpected, so that was cool, too. Amazon rules!"
5,"Levi quality, Amazon selection!",Needed a size that few brick & mortar stores keep in stock. Amazon had style I wanted in the size that I wanted at a good price!
2,Yikes. These are tight!!!,"I'm 5'11"" 185 lbs, muscular build. It took effort to stuff my thighs and bits into these, leaving me uncomfortable throughout the day. Luckily I was able to find a friend these worked for."
4,woodennichols,non common size request was delivered promply before Christmas. My son was very happy with the fit and color.
1,Levis Suck!!!,"When the Chinese bought-out Levi Strauss & Co. they surrendered the quality of the Levi brand to history. Levi is not now or will they ever return to being the best pants money can buy. Shame, Shame, Shame on Levi Strauss & Co. Levis are not even of high enough quality to be considered ""suckfull"". Levis are now just another company making highly generic clothes from China, Honduras, Bangladesh, or wherever..."
1,unhappy,The length is way off. I have 30L with shorter legs. Other than that they would be OK I guess. But I wouldn't have bought them if I knew the length was a lie.
3,"Great fit,...maybe not so great quality","I bought these jeans for my husband. He has worn 517 for more than 30 years now. He loves these. He did mention that the fit was a little different this time. The leg is a more trim fit. He has very skinny legs so he liked that. He also thought the material was a little thinner, which would work for him for his summer gardening. he never wears shorts! After wearing these jeans only twice, two small holes developed out of nowhere in the front thigh of the jeans. I am sending them back, but am going to order a replacement. Perhaps this was just a fluke. I will place an update later on."
2,G & L Clothing,"Great product. Communication was lacking. Amazon website indicated 2 pair were available at time of purchase. When they were not received in a timely fashion (ordered for a birthday present), I initiated communication with G&L Clothing. They stated the merchandise was out of stock & had to be ordered. I will buy this product again, but not from this company. They should have been proactive in notifying me of the backorder issue instead of remaining silent."
1,Height does not correspond to the size of the product,"I feel disappointed with this product levi's, in many occasions I have bought this brand of jeans in my country and for amazon and I never had problems with the heights, they all have come perfect, but this product not come correctly, my height is 34x 32 though these trousers have this marked height, is not correctly. this one is too small and I have others identical of the same height and model and I still have them excellent, I feel disappointed by this purchase. I have ten jeans of the same brand of diverse models 34x32 and I still have them correct, this one not. The height marked in this jeans is not real."
2,Toooo Long,"Tags on clothing say 29"" length. They are 30 1/2"" so I have to hem them. According to Levi's website they do not have a 29"" length so?"
2,Levi's is all over the place,"I am a long time fan of Levi's but this company is all over the place. I cannot understand how there numerical style system works because it is almost meaningless. I got these and the waist was too big, thighs too small and boot cut seems to be almost more of a bell bottom look rather than having room for boots. I then got a size smaller locally of the 514 straight fit and they were almost the exact same overall, including the boot area. So if your waist measures 34 with a measuring tape, this 34 is too large and 33 in the 514 is also too large. However, the thighs are tight in both so I figure a 32 (which possibly might actually measure 34) is probably going to looking like skinny jeans. because the thighs will be too small. So good luck with all that."
3,Typical Levi size irregularities.,"Not exactly a slim fit in the thigh. The 29"" length is actually 30.5 . Width of back pockets now range from 6"" to 7"" depending on the pair. The 7"" back pockets look like big butt Farmer Jones jeans. Unfortunately this has been going on ever since they left the USA. (oh my god, I must be a protectionist) Maybe washing will help a little but I think I'm done with Levi. I've only been wearing them since the 50s."
1,Levi's are not what they use to be,"Quality is no longer the same and the fit varies from wich country it is made and the mood of that worker that day!!! One day hopefully we'll start making are own merchandise like the old days, with quality and pride!!!"
3,Too small,I bought these for my husband and returned them for the size up and it was still too small around the waist. Very nice looking jeans!
3,"great jeans, a bit on the tight side",I love levi's but these are just a bit too tight around the thigh(at least for me). but they look great and run true to size.
5,Levi's Men's 517 Boot Cut Jean,"Good price, perfect quality. Very good model for young and old-aged people. Gorgeous color. Classic zipper. I'm satisfied! I recommend to buy it."
3,to small,the waist size is smaller than stated if you buy these pants with a longer inseam the waist size is right
4,"Quality and fit is good, Need more sizes.","I have always appreciated the fit and quality of Levi jeans. The boot cut has a closer fit around the knee with comfortable room in the hips and waist. What Levi Strauss needs to understand is that there is a huge population of men out there that has a 31 inch inseam. Men between 5'9"" and 6' fall into this size range. My growth did not stop at 30"" inseam, and did not make it to 32"". So I either buy high water jeans that show my socks, or I let the cuffs drag the floor which signicantly reduces the life of the jeans. I liked the fit enough that I spent an additional $10 to get them hemmed to 31."
3,2nd pair were fine!,"Typical Levi's Quality, the 1st pair sent had a bad leg seam.They got me ""locked into"" the brand at an early age though, and I wouldn't consider wearing another. At 50, I am not much for lables, but I have been wearing these so long they are like a 2nd skin."
4,Less hefty denim.,These jeans fit well but the denim seems less hefty than the denim of the same 517s from 5 years ago.
4,Love my Levis!,"The jeans were great! The price was right, they were delivered in a timely fashion, and I lost a few lbs to get in them and I look good. lol . I recommend this company."
3,BEWARE S&H!,"When I ordered 2 pair of Levi's for hubby, I didn't notice that one pair would be coming from another company. Of course, THAT MEANS EXTRA s&h, which I wasn't counting on and was disappointed about....boo! Just so you know what you're getting and having to pay for. Also, the color was a bit different than what we're used to; would decscribe it if I could..."
3,May be counterfeits,"Just to let some of you know, Levi does not make the 517 in a 35"" waist, yet I see this seller selling this size of 517. If the Levi sites does not show it and someone is selling it, it's got to be counterfeit. It would explain some of the bad reviews here.On aother note, I have had a lot of problem with inconsistant labeling. I have bought 3 pairs of levi's from a retail store, all marked the same size, but when I get them home and try them on, one will usually be very tight, like it was mislabeled. This happens a lot. I used to think it was counterfeits, but I bought them all from the same location from what appears to be a legitimate retailer.I think there is a problem with counterfeits, but I also think levi my be blaming counterfeits for some of it's quality control issuess."
2,VERY Tight!,"I am a size 30x32 and buy alot of jeans. I also carry a concealed weapin in my waistband and for the most part, never have a problem with any other jeans. These jeans, however were so tight that i could barely button them even without my weaponi on me."
1,Never Shop Here Again,Purchased Two Pair Of Jeans Only Got One. Was Told They Only Had One Pair And Never Heard Another Word But Got Charged For Two Pair.
3,"Levi's Men's 517 Boot Cut Jean, Black, 36x29","Hmmmm, seems like the newer version of the same jeans I have are slightly different?! The thighs are significantly tighter, and I certainly have NOT bulked up on my thigh muscles over the summer. The older pair still fit fine.... These are going to need breaking in...."
4,Ordered for Teen Son,"I ordered these jeans for my 16yo son & he really liked them. The only thing he would have preferred was a lower rise, but he's wearing them without complaints. :)"
5,Levi's Men's 517 Jeans,"I ordered these for Christmas for my 6' 2"" grandson who had grown out of all his pants after checking stores and finding his size is almost impossible to find. They were perfect and he loved them."
2,TOO BAGGY,too baggy. The wwrong side was received. I need 40 X 34 and received 42 X 34. I washed them ( I wash all new clothes before wearing) and then found them to be too large. I Looked at the size tag and saw it saying 42 X 34. I re-ordered the correct size which fits right. I guess I am stuck with the fat pants.
3,there's slim and then there's slim,"Amazingly, the 517 boot cut was slimmer about the thighs than the 514 slim straight leg, which was described as the slimmest. Same size, not same fit, so had to return."
5,Levi 517,"A well tried and true blue jean that I've been wearing for decades. The fit, finish, and quality is a good as or better than ever."
3,Levi Jeans,"I opened the package the day before our Christmas. Realized the color was not what I thought I ordered, which was Rigid. I wanted blue jean standard color. Luckily the husband was understanding and is wearing a pair."
4,Third pair of these jeans,I love these jeans. For me they are perfect. Long enough to wear with or without boots and the fit is not too tight. How can you go wrong with Levi's?
2,Too small for 34 size compared with other 34 sizes,"I ordered 4 jeans, 34 size each, the Boot Cut is 1 size smaller than the 505 Straight Fit I also purchased in same order."
4,Good transaction,I got what I ordered promptly. I wish I had ordered a different color but --my bad. No complaints. What else can I say?
2,they smell weird,"I ordered 2 pair in the rinsed color, they have a very strong chemical odor that only got stronger after washing them. I am returning them."
5,This book will live in your barn.....,"You will find yourself reaching for Jean-Pierre's Equine Massage - A Practical Guide again and again due to the easy format, clear layout and concise explanations whether you have a backyard horse or a show barn full. I have been managing a 60 plus farm for over 10 years that has a combination of young stock just starting, working show horses, and retirees, and this book is invaluable to the staff in keeping the owner's horses well and happy. The boarders here are in similar situations and the copies are out and in use due to the ease of the spiral bound setup. It is with great appreciation all of us have that Jean-Pierre has taken the time to educate us in the wellness of our partners and friends."
4,it was GREAT!,"had this book been smaller, it would have been perfect! or had more photos.... i used it as a reference while i was working on my horse and it was kind of hard to manage both the massage and the reading at the same time;)"
4,Honesty,"This is a very informative book, detailed in every way. The only problem is understanding the parts being I am a layman. But with much study I believe this book will help me recognize and determine the proper procedure to take to better comfort my mare."
4,"Clear, well written and well illustrated","I already had a few basic massage techniques from my equine physio and this book is exactly what I wanted to further my knowledge.The beginning of the book includes a series of clear detailed anatomical pictures. One of the final sections looks at the kinesiology of the horse and common injuries, stress points and problems for various sporting disciplines.Each technique is then described and shown. Practical hints such as using your bathroom scales to work out what 'X'lbs of pressure feels like, abound.To make the book even better there are then sections which describe what various 'routines' might be made up of (relaxation for instance) and how long to spend etc. There are also recommendations for how to start with a new horse, body signals to look for and when you may need a helper."
5,So cute!,"These ornaments are adorable! I love the fact that they light up when plugged into your own light strand and they are sizable ornaments. I bought a bunch for Christmas gifts and at this price for Dept 56, they are a steal!"
5,very clever,"My one-year-old is singing to this! This is very clever, the kids listen to it on the way to preschool and learn the lyrics. Then Saturday morning comes around and we have videos to match! It's like MTV and radio. Great idea."
3,too much too much,"if this book were half of it's 420 pages, it would've been an excellent read. overall, i think the book is a great study of America in mid-century and especially of gay culture at that time. Anecdotes and quotes are repeated frequently in the book which gave me a sense of deja-vu as I was reading it."
1,PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!,"This is another ""miracle"" product that I wasted money on. The first time I tried the product, I used it on my stomach, there was no difference. Although upset, I didn't want to completely give up after one use. After trying the legs, thighs, and arms, and seeing no inch loss using tape measure, the rest of the product went right in the garbage. I know many people don't want to hear this, but the best way to lose pounds and inches without side effects is to exercise and eat right. This is a fact that I am struggling to deal with myself. There's no such thing as a ""miracle"" product, but if someone finds one, let me know......"
5,Best Pet Bed EVER!,"I have been buying this bed for 15 years for my dogs. I had 4 and replaced them every 3 years, only because I washed them tooooo much, but these beds are comfortable for your dog and look great in your house, very neat! I got friendly with manufacturer when I carried the product in my retail store. I have been searching for 4 months for the manufacturer and I can't find them. I have another Great Dane puppy and need and want this bed desparately. No bed holds up or looks as good as this one. I am shocked to find on Amazon and now it is unavailable. VERY SAD CUSTOMER!"
2,Not so great,I don't like this as much as I thought I would. The cork always gets caught in the holder & it is not as strong as I imagined.
3,Doubtful of longevity,"I was a little disapointed when I received this item to find out it's all plastic except the corkscrew part. I've used it a few times and so far it's holding up, but I'm leary of how long it will hold up due to the materials. I'm afraid over time the handles will break off if there is too much pressure exerted. I've purchsed OXO products in the past and have always been pleased with the quality, just not this one. It has a 100% replacement guarantee but I'm sure the buyer would have to pay for shipping so I'm not sure it would even be worth the hassle-just buy a sturdier one. As I said I've just used this a few times and gave it 3 stars due to material construction. Only time will tell how long it really lasts......."
5,Easy to Use,"I've only had the opportunity to use the opener on 2 bottles, but both times it was a breeze. Easy to Use and easy to grip."
1,no good,"this corkscrew is flawed in several ways: in spite of its ""ergonomic"" design, it is awkward to use. the screw is too short and often mauls the cork beyond recognition and reuse. simply screwing it into the cork and pulling the wings down does not pull the cork far enough out of the bottle--you have to wiggle, wiggle, wiggle it. save your money."
2,broke after 2 years of (very occasional) use,"i had this for 2 years and used it about once a month. i was very happy with it at first, since it was very easy to use. however i found that it had no way of stopping when the cork had been screwed up high enough, and it just kept going, so that the cork would become wedged in the opener, then it would break off and i would have to use a knife to try and prise the cork out of the device. this happened a few times, and the last time i just couldn't get the cork out, which meant i couldn't use the corkscrew, because it already had a cork around the top part of it. after a while i had to throw it out."
3,"OK Corkscrew, But Mostly Plastic","This OXO ""Winged Corkscrew"" is mechanically well designed but the mostly plastic construction gives this a very flimsy feel that makes me question it's longevity. The corkscrew does work well and allowed for very easy removal of the four bottles I tested it on, but I could feel the ""wings"" flex with the effort.As another reviewer noted, I would not have likely bought this from a store after feeling it in my hands. This is going into my camper and will only see light usage.CFH"
3,"Works, But Lacks The Sturdiness To Instill Me With Consumer Confidence","If you think I'm going to gush over a corkscrew, it's really not my style. Let me say that I am a HUGE fan of OXO products--I fell in love with them years ago and have never wavered. I am rarely disappointed (though it has happened), so I jumped at the chance to add this to my OXO inventory. I'm currently using a ratty old metal corkscrew that I've had for years and thought this would be an upgrade.I must admit--I'm a little concerned. The OXO handle really doesn't add much (perhaps it's slightly easier on the hand). I have opened a few bottles and it works fine. However, the unit just doesn't seem sturdy. Maybe that is only my perception and maybe it will last for years, but the plastic components just don't fill me with confidence. Had I looked at this in a store, felt it and handled it--I probably would not have purchased it. Seriously. My suggestion, try to look at this one first hand before ordering it."
3,Basic winged corkscrew without bottle opener,"This is your basic winged corkscrew. Expected OXO improvements are the over-sized and rubberized head for better grip when twisting the top. The wings are a smooth matte hard plastic that the body is also made of.Pros:*The worm is Teflon coated and slides in and out of the cork easily. This is usually a feature reserved for high-priced, high-end corkscrews.*Top has the signature OXO over-sized & rubberized grip.*Lightweight and comfortable to use.Cons:* Over-sized head does not have the bottle opener feature that many winged corkscrews have* Only the head is rubberized and not the wings* Body and wings are made of a smooth matte plastic that seems likely to crack, shatter & break if accidentally dropped.Overall a decent winged corkscrew designed for hand comfort but with reduced features. So far, at 3 winery events, this corkscrew has easily and comfortably opened 15+ bottles of wine. Recommended."
3,Meh,"It works ok and operates pretty much like any other corkscrew. Insert the screw into the cork, twist the top knob, the ""wings"" rise up, you press 'em down...wine is open. We own several corkscrews and this one is OK for the money...feels a little flimsy but gets the job done. If you're looking for a quality corkscrew that you will own for decades, this isn't it."
1,Broke the First Time I Tried to Use It,I purchased this product because Oxo has a good reputation. This thing broke the first time I tried to use it. It came apart into several pieces and couldn't be salvaged. Such GARBAGE!! Would NOT recommend.
2,"Cheap, expected more from OXO","Ours broke within a year. The mechanism stripped after about 5 uses, leaving us with the screw in the cork, and no way to get it out. Spend a little more money on a better piece. Good wine deserves a good corkscrew."
2,strangely disappointing,"Perhaps I shouldn't have expected much from such an inexpensive item, but right off the bat it seemed off-kilter somehow: the screw tended to go at an angle into the cork, making it hard to withdraw and more likely to break. I haven't had extensive experience with corkscrews; still, this one seems unnecessarily, even dangerously, sharp to me. There's a little round collar on the top that's supposed to keep the screw from wiggling around and it pops out of its socket a lot. The idea's a good one - the easy-to-grip parts and the size and so forth - but it doesn't seem to work well in practice. I've been struggling along with this for almost a year, but I think I'll try one of the wine waiter corkscrews now."
2,Not Good,"The grip is great, but the ""screw"" part of the corkscrew extends too far below the lip. By the time it's all the way into the cork, the wings are only halfway up, meaning that when you push them down, the cork pops only about halfway out.I have to tug just as much as I do with my Swiss army knife corkscrew."
1,Not OXO quality,When I thought of OXO I though of great grips. Nice soft quality weighty feel. When I got this corkscrew I was shocked to find out that it was flimsy black plastic. Looks like OXO in the picture but it is nothing more then cheap plastic bits. OXO degraded their name with this product.
1,Terible - plastic split in half after less than 3 months,"This product is garbage. I bought it for the OXO name, but I will never do that again. During a dinner party, the plastic split right near the top, and exposed the metal rod that attaches the screw to the plastic mechanism. The corkscrew would not work after this piece broke. (Note: the corkscrew broke after a total of less than 10 corks were removed in approximately 3 months...not heavy use by any standards. Wish I'd kept my receipt.)I also had the same problem other reviewers had with the wings not allowing for any room to grasp the top of the bottle.Moral of the story: Buy an all metal winged corkscrew. >$5 at most grocery stores."
5,A real page-turner,"I know that a book is good when I have to put everything else on hold until I finish it. This one grabbed me right from the beginning. On the very first page I felt as though I was the playwright, experiencing the highs and lows of being accepted, rejected and accepted again as an artist. This book was a lot of fun, full of dry wit and good humor. I especially enjoyed getting the inside track into the world of Broadway and film and finding out from a first-hand source what some of those Oscar-winning superstar actors are REALLY like."
5,Great Gloves......,"These are very nice gloves, and I was very pleased. They are well worth the money, fine comfortable leather & very good quality. These are far better gloves then you would find in the Quicky Mart. I also suggest a pair of cotton jersey gloves to be worn with these also for a fine warm comfortable feeling, if you buy these gloves, you will not be disappointed......."
4,"Good Gloves, Lack of care in construction","The gloves arrived fine. Good condition, fit, and tough leather. However, one of the seams was unstitched upon arrival and requred a little work with a needle and some thread to repair before using."
5,"Well made, but a little bulky.","A well made work glove, and stylish looking too.The fabric allows for greater flexibility, whilst the all leather index finger insures longevity."
2,"Expensive carriage, low quality","This T-shirt looks so cool with digital camo. However, attention when you decide to pay for it, especially, the carriage. It costs pretty much than T-shirt itself."
3,The Eleventh Hour - Jars of Clay,"I am disappointed. The rating of three stars is simply a carry over from the first CD. This one like the others before it can't hold a candle to the first. It sounds like any one of hundreds of pop albums. There is nothing different, nothing exceptionally artistic, no origional stuff on this album, except excellent lyrics (thank God). The first album was such a cool sound. Layers of strings. Pointed lyrics dressed in music that is inspiring, strangly familiar, novel and full of feeling. My suggestion -- Find an open field ""of wild flowers, breathe the air and fly away,"" and talk to Jesus..."
4,Great Work-,"The recording quality shines thru on this album! Their self-titled excellent album has that ""B"" level sound - This one sounds great-professional and rich. Dan Haseltine sounds a lot like Matthew Sweet-(a performer worth checking out)-that draws me in more than ever- nice voice - and ""Silence"" is Golden- God is Great-"
2,What is the Big Idea?,"Ok the first Jars cd was superb. It had passion, and it had beautiful lyrics about God, and the lyrics were honest. Now what has happened? The lyrics have become watered down. Yes you can find hints of God, but they are very watered down. The music also is a disappointment. People are saying that this is a very strong album musically. I don't see the big idea of the amount of talent. I was strongly disappointed. Come on Jars, stick with your honest and strong lyrics, and your beautiful acoustic arrangements. A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!"
5,Not Their Worst Hour,"Jars of Clay have come a long way in their journey as musicians and artists, and The Eleventh Hour rings true in showing forth the evidence of this. Their faith and message pours out through the power of music, which extends beyond all boundaries. The songs cover many different emotional ranges. With the steady beat in the first song. The second song, ""Something Beautiful"" with it's deep message, leads into the third song which is ""Revolution"" giving listeners a little more umph. It is a great sing along song. The other tracks lead on in this way taking the listener where ever they are willing to go. Great twists and vibes with the instruments take us on a musical journey. Number nine has been my favorite, ""The Eleventh Hour."" The last two songs bring the album to a great close, and give it life. Jars of Clay are guiding us using the music, but just like the rest of us they are in search for something more. I can't wait to see what they come out with next!"
5,A Masterpiece,"In my humble opinion, The Eleventh Hour is the best Jars Of Clay album yet, even edging out their mega-popular self-titled debut. The four-song stretch of ""Revolution""-""Fly""-""I Need You""-""Silence"", each song brilliant in its own unique way, is some of the finest 16 minutes of music you'll hear. The rest of the album shines as well, especially on the melodic rock of ""Disappear"" and the poignant title song. Easily one of the best albums of 2002."
4,This Album Had To Grow On Me,"My original rating and review of this album was rather negative. I have listened to this album many more times since my original review and have decided to give it a better rating and review. Although not the best Jars Of Clay album, it is a very good album. The catchy pop hooks and radio-friendly songs as heard on their debut self-titled release and ""If I Left The Zoo"" are missing, but further listen has caused me to respect this album more than my first listen. Close listening has uncovered some very deep and spiritually personal lyrics. Overall, this is a very good contemporary alternative pop album. I recommend this for fans of Jars Of Clay or fans of their style of music."
3,"ok, but not really","this cd is not the good old jars of clay that I know. it's kind of weird and its just not them. i really only like ""these ordinary days"", but the rest are just ok. theyre not as acoustic and doesn't sound jars of clayish."
3,One step closer....,"I have always felt that Jars of Clay's first album is clearly the best. The next two strayed away from the accoustic feel. This album is one step closer to the Jars of Clay I love. However, I still miss the strings and woodwinds that the first album so good. I still reccommend it though."
4,goooood,"I think this is right up there with the rest of their albums, which I thought were awesome. But I am going to sum it up...Really good cd, Most songs are right on, with one miss (I didn't like the song Whatever She Wants very much...{at least, it didn't hit MY target : ). Still, it's very much worth the purchase. Heck, this cd is worth purchasing just for The Eleventh Hour and Silence alone. : )"
5,love it,"the eleventh hour is beautiful and haunting. not as upbeat as some previous jars stuff, but still quality."
4,Enjoyable album,"Personally, I have always thought that Jars of Clay first album has been their best. It is nice to see them return to form on this effort - the result is an enjoyable album which presents a wide range of their talent.The song writing on this album is excellent. They move from hard hitting songs like ""Revolution"" and ""Whatever she wants"" to the more melodic ""The Eleventh Hour"" to much slower ones like ""Silence"" and ""I need you"" with great success. I really like the fact that the band is not using a set formula, or sound for conveying their love for God. Of course, their lyrics can be somewhat subtle in terms of their belief in Jesus, but you can identify their faith if you listen closely to the words.I recommend this album to any Jars of clay fan. If you have not liked the last few albums, give this one a try, I think you will enjoy it. If you are unfamiliar with the band, I would recommend that you buy their first one, and then this add this one later."
2,return to roots?,"i must admit i was quite disappointed with jars's latest. although i frequently hear that the band is ""returning to their roots"", i find nothing even remotely similar to their early work except that they produced it themselves. i have been forced to come to terms with the fact that jars of clay is in a downward spiral, both musically and lyrically, that began with ""if i left the zoo."" maybe i'm being unfair. perhaps i'm being too tough on them. their first two albums were such masterpieces that any subsequent releases were bound to be disappointments. but now that i think about it, no, i'm not being too rough with the chaps. jars began with similar musical roots to caedmon's call, and caedmon's has stayed strong and matured as a band, while jars has diverged onto the wide, well-traveled path of ccm mediocrity. lyrical shallowness kills this album, and just cannot satiate the depth of meaning required for a really great jars album. thus, i rate the cd a 2 out of 5"
2,just a little bummed,"Yeah, so this one just didn't do it for me. I've been touched by every Jars album thus far, but can't manage to make myself like this one. After the personal sounds and emotions on their self-titled debut, I fully expected to enjoy their return to more raw sounds after the experimentation of ""If I Left the Zoo"" (which I also enjoyed), but this album left me disappointed. It felt forced. They've grown up musically and the sound doesn't, and shouldn't, work for them anymore. Also, the lyrics of ""The Eleventh Hour"" didn't feel as personal and interesting as their earlier stuff and really felt distant from the music. Songs I really enjoyed included the title track, ""I Need You"", and ""The Scarlet Letter"". Nothing else really struck me. Bummer."
2,I suppose I should have seen it coming,"Jars of Clay has gone from being a really good band, to being a really good christian band. Lyrically and muscially i find nothing moving about the eleventh hour. Perhaps my perspective is skewed because I want to hear something sonically comprable to their debut. Whatever the reason, the eleventh hour is a good cd, but nothing to marvel over. Maybe they will quit trying to be like other bands and go back to what they are good at...Sounding like Jars of Clay."
4,The Eleventh Hour........awesome,"i am astonished at the music intelligence of this band. they could have settled for an easy melody that will sell a bunch of records but they decided to take almost 2 years off and produce and write this wonderful cd. it is filled with emotions like you wont believe. i would say that this is their second best album of all time being that their first one is uncomparible. the reason i give this a four is because they do not say the word ""God"" or ""Jesus"" once in the album. they refer to Him many many times but it lacks that worship aspect. this cd has no boundaries...every time i listen to it i am filled. i dont know how they do it. this might possibly be there last album...i dont know...i hope not, but it is definately one to end an awesome career on."
5,Diary of an Old Soul,"I find this book of daily devotionals beautiful. The book is one which I shall treasure, and no matter the year, or how many times I have read each day the words will and always will still move me. MacDonald is my master."
4,It Grew On Me,"When I was about 1/4 through these poems, I was pretty sure I was going to give it a thumbs-down review. However, they sort of crept up on me and grew on me over time and now I can say with only slight reservation that I'm a fan of this one! This is really soul-searching poetry."
4,Richly expressed thoughts,MacDonald leaves you thinking about all the things that matter in this beautiful little book - devotional and poetic.
1,Aweful - Horrible Edition,"Origionally, I was given this book in 1979; it is profound and awe inspiring in the faith provoking poetry that George Macdonald wrote - one 7 line poem/meditation for each day of the year.I boughtt this new book as a gift. However this edition is horrible in that it appears to have been pasted together, daily poems may be numbered at the bottom of one page and begin on the next. Or the day's poem may be split between one page and the next. Several were mostly gibberish. Also there is no introduction, library of congress number or date of publication (or origional publication)to this edition.It is a mess !"
1,Save your money,"Unless you are brand new to issues of spirtuality, this book weill seem simplistic and unsatifying."
1,A Never-ending BAD soap opera---,"Thank goodness that's over! Ninety-nine percent of this story was about EVERYONE's never-ending emotional problems and it went on and on. I don't know if this story could have been saved by a psychiatrist... or a good exorcist. It could have been an interesting plot: a kidnap-mystery with a twist, including a late-night sexy-voiced DJ...but it ended being quite creepy (all the female's obsession over the DJ) and extremely cheesy. The mystery was barely mentioned and the ""twist"" was made way too obvious early on as it could have been a good ""shocker"" at the end.Narrator, Sandra Burr, uses a little-girl, syrupy voice for her females and usually a goofy or nasally voice for her males."
1,change the station,"A bland and sluggish 1988 effort from the usually dependable Delinsky.I found the main characters to be very one dimensional.One character in particular is extremely annoying and highly unlikable. I don't thinkit was meant to come across that way.The plot had promise but in my reading experience it just didn't quite come together.Another character is a sexy-voiced disc jockey.If Heart of the Night was a radio station, you would be reaching for the knob well before the end of this song.I don't like to be negative about authors I admire strongly, but the powerful narrative ofDelinsky is painfully missing here.Buy it half-price if you are a completist and must have allthe Delinsky's."
5,Worth Reading,This book is well worth anyone's time who wishes to learn more about the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico. Joe Sando is an expert in the field and one of the few Pueblos that have written about his own culture and people and the long and successful fight they have waged for survival.
2,Disappointed with quality,"I purchased this as a gift. It is very hard to find so I will not return it and it is what they had asked for. For the price, I was quite disappointed in the quality. I have a case of my own that I have had for many years. The inside is lined with felt and appears more finished than this one."
1,poor quality,"The company was cooperative but the product was inferiour. The refund was made reluctantly when the shipper found ""nothing wrong with the product"". When reeived I found a hinge on the case hanging loose which I fixed in hopes of keeping the bar but the quality of the accessories was very poor and I returned it. Long process."
5,very convenient traveling bar,"We bought this for our vacation. We went to Foxwoods and wanted to have drinks and snacks in the room. It worked out wonderfully!! I would recomend it for anyone who likes to have a cocktail in their room before going out for the night, or mid-day snack."
1,Disappointed,"The quality of the piece was very poor. There is no cusion for the bottles and the bar pieces do not stay in place. I am looking for a type of felt or foam that I could buy to make it a little more secure. Being a last minute shopper, I bought this as a gift and did not have time to return it for a different one. I was a little embarrassed giving it."
4,very pleased,Just received this travel bar and am very happy with it. So glad there was a lock and key for our privacy because we travel quite a bit. The straps could have been a little tighter but product satisfactory over all.
4,make sure you hit a stud,"Used these to hang my ~14 pound speakers. The first one I put straight into a stud, and had absolutely no problems with it. The second one I tried putting on drywall with the included anchor, and it was not holding well. I ended up ripping that one off the wall and moving it to a less ideal location over a stud. If they included better anchors with the mount, or had better advice on when to use them in drywall in the instructions, I would definitely give this 5 stars. Once it is up on the wall good and tight, it is a great mount."
2,Weight rating is misleading,"I have used the Omnimounts twice: the system rated for 20 pounds, with 16-pound speakers; and the system rated for 10 pounds, with 7-pound speakers. In both cases, I tightened the ball joint as much as possible and the mounts still wouldn't hold the speaker in the desired position. In addition, the drywall mounts on the 10.0 failed completely, and the instructions are vague and not terribly helpful. Finally, the location of the Allen fastener for tightening the ball joint is all but inaccessible. I can't recommend this system."
3,will not support the weight they claim to,"i was excited to find a set of mounts that claimed to hold the weight of my speakers. but while they do hang from the wall, they are supposd to be adjustable so you can aim the speakers. well the teeth don't bite into the plastic ball good enough to hold the weight they claim. so the speakers end up sliding down to the lowest aiming position until the stud bottoms out in the wall mounted socket. it worked out perfectly for me since that's where i needed them anyway, but you don't have a choice if you go with a heavy speaker. other than that they are pretty sturdy. the price was decent compared to others. and they do look pretty nice."
2,Pretty bad,"The range of motion is so limited that I can't aim the damn speakers right without a lot of fuss. The design is such that screwing them into the wall is just this HUGE pain in the butt. The plastic is brittle instead of having some malleability, so when I messed up and drove a screw too far in it instantly cracked, rather than having any squish. Poorly engineered all around, and not even the the best price on the market. Would not buy again."
5,GREAT MOUNTS! GREAT PRICE!,"These Omni speaker mounts worked just as advertised. I am very pleased they look great (not that you can see much of them) and were easy to install (well it's not rocket science- would have been easier with two people like the directions say). We used them to mount a couple of 18lb speakers in a large room. We needed the floor space so it was important to get the speakers up high. If you are mounting anywhere near the ceiling though, get the ceiling mount set, even if you are mounting on the wall. The longer extension arm will give you more options for speaker adjustment. I would definitely buy them again and recommend them to anyone looking to get their speakers up on the wall or ceiling."
4,Great mount,"The Omni mounts are some of the top notch mounts on the market today. They are basically indestructible. The 20lb rated mounts appear to be able to hold up a horse if you drill them into a stud. The only reason I did not rate these 5 stars is actually amazons fault. There is only one mount per package, even though the description says mounts. Although these mounts are worth price even it its for one."
2,Badly Underengineered,"These mounts may work well for speakers less than 10 pounds, but they are certainly not good enough for he speakers I had at 13 lbs. and the notion of actually attempting to mount 20 lb. speakers is laughable. As others have said, the actual build quality and materals is quite high; however the weight rating/engineering is woefully inadequate. I purchased some very nice screwdriver type hex drvers and was able to put a great deal of torque on the mount but my 13 lb. speakers still sagged."
1,Would not hold my 12 pound SVS SBS-02's,"Not really much to say. They don't do what they advertise they will do, which is hold a speaker up to twenty pounds without sagging down. My speakers only weigh a little over half of the product's rated capacity, and the manufacturer of these speakers specifically recommended these mounts to me. Very disappointed.Contacting Omnimount's customer support only yielded a repeating of the information that is clearly stated in the provided user manual, which I had followed to the letter, and retried over and over unsuccessfully to get them to hold.I wish that I had gone with the cheaper future shop mounts made of cheap hard plastic that I used to mount my home theater surrounds instead of spending almost $100 for these things. If I have one good thing to say, they appear to be very well made of solid materials however this unfortunately does not lead to improved performance."
3,The grip is poor but easy to fix,"I was unable to tighten the frame compression bolt enough to hold up 11-pound speakers straight out from the wall, even using vice grips on the allen wrench. This is the worst case mechanical scenario for these mounts, other than adding 9 pounds.)The plastic mounting ball is held by teeth (bumps) in the inside of the mount frame. The problem is that the heavy powder coating makes these bumps too slippery.I found that putting a small strip of coarse sandpaper between the frame and ball (grit toward the ball) allowed the mount to hold the speakers perpendicularly. Extreme tightening wasn't required, only a few ""creak""s beyond tight. Sticky-back sandpaper would be easier to use, I decided too late... Other types of ""grip"" could also be used - look around you.These are clean and simple mounts, and flexible for angled mounting. I have speakers with back ports, so the wall clearance is essential. They just need more tooth in the teeth..."
3,WARNING: Only 1 mount is included,"I ordered this product thinking it would be a pair, and it's not a pair. It's only one mount. For $30. Ouch.Since then, I've extensively researched HDTV mounts and concluded that Omnimount is extremely overpriced.Bottom line, this is ONE overpriced mount."
2,Weight of speaker is a factor,"There are several reviews that reference the fact that heavier speakers sag with this mount. I found the same thing to be true. One mount i purchased held the speaker nicely while the other would not hold the same position even after numerous attempts. I did find an easy solution. I used small piece of wire (i.e.. a coat hanger) cut to the proper length to use as support at the bottom of the speaker to keep it from sagging. It is really a shame that i had to find a solution to this problem in that these mounts are pricey, but it works perfectly just the same. It was a lot easier than shipping them back to the retailer and finding another option."
4,Good universal speaker mounts,"These mounts worked perfectly for my surround sound rear speakers. Not all parts depicted in the illustrations were provided, but enough for my application. The instructions were very small print and not the best, but were adequate. I would recommend them. Not sure what the long term service will be from them, but they seem to be well constructed."
2,BEWARE: not al white. Ball is BLACK,Ordered four of these overpriced hangers. urprised the items look different from the picture. The ball is actually BLACK!! How does that happen?? Returned immediately.
2,Not as good as I thought it would be.,"First there is only one in the package, and I thought it came as a pair. I bought the white one, but the ball was black and not all white as shown in the picture.It looks very sturdy, but the screw was too big for my Cinema 800 rear speakers, so I had to send it back and get the white ones from Definitive Technology which were about the same price for the pair."
5,"""I can't give this a ten because.....""","well, because: if you label something as a ten,that specific item would now be the barometer for which all other CDs will be measured. What if something emerges that is superior lyrically? For instance, Ras Kas has slightly honed his speech better than common. (I might get some grief for this) And if it wasn't for underachieving beats and production, he would be very close to perfection.All in All, this is one of my favorite records of all time. it's in my car, my house, and at work. Common is gifted in the art of one-liners, and his perception of whats real is both tremondous and applaudible."
5,just get it,"If you've heard any Common, you know how he is one of the most uniquely skilled mc's, period. If you've heard ""One Day It'll All Make Sense"", or ""Like Water for Chocolate"" and you realy loved them, then you'll like this too. Everyone of his albums has a different sound to it, but he expresses his undeniable skill on each and everyone of them, this one is no exception. This cd has a track that might be my favorite of all time in "" I Used to H.E.R."" The whole album has a half old school half modern underground feel to it. The bottom line is, if you love hip hop get this."
4,Common's Got Lyrics. Hip-Hop At Its Finest.,"I bought this album mainly due to the single Resurrection and I found out very fast that this isn't just a ""one-hit"" CD. The whole album is nice and definitely a major improvement from his first, Can I Borrow a Dollar. He's got lyrics and uses them to rap about the various aspects of life that really matter. If you like to learn while you listen and listen while you learn, this is the one CD for you. No doubt. Pick it up ASAP. This one's a true gem. Peace."
5,"CLASSIC, CLASSIC, CLASSIC","Man, I couldn't stop playing this when I first picked it up. Man, this is one of the best hip hop albums ever!!!! No joke. Every track is great. No wack track. Common comes correct lyrically and how can you go wrong with an album that starts off with the songs Resurrection and I Used to Love H.E.R. Man, great beats, Mista Sinista, formerly of the X-ecutioners lays some nice cuts, beats are nice and soulfull. Get this now!!!! One of the best albums ever."
3,Pluses and Minuses,"Common has some catchy tunes and clever lyrics, in particular the jazzy track #1 and some of the middle tracks. Common also deserves high marks for retaining old-school rap techniques such as scratching. However, I can only give this record 3 stars because a number of the tracks just don't cut it, the production overall is just so-so and Common's voice is not so great; in fact, his voice sounds like Arrested Development with a head cold. Anyway, it's a good record to add to the collection, it will get some play from time to time."
5,Common's more polished sophomore album delivers...............,I slept on this dude big time. Just checking out in 07.Key Joints:Chapter 13 (Rich Man Vs. Poor Man) (Very Good)I Used To Love H.E.R. (Classic)ResurrectionCommunismIn My Own World (Check The Method)Pop's Rap
5,100th review (i think),"this cd, as of late july 2007 has 4 1/2 starsi disagreethis is a 5 star cdand where is this Ynot guy on Chapter 13 (rich man vs. Poorman) his verse is so nice"
3,"fine soundtrack, sound quality is just ok","This album needs to be remastered. It would sound a lot better than it does now. The disc's sound quality is merely passable, not as vibrant as it should be. The work of black soul artists should get the same respect that white rock acts do."
3,"Yes, it extracts the cork easily, but....","Many older people love Oxo tools and utensils because of their ergonomic grips. Although I am still fairly spry, I have many Oxo products because they are just better-designed for the human hand than most. This corkscrew operates on the proven ""Screwpull"" design by extracting the cork quite effortlessly through a continuous screwing action. However, there is no easy way to get the cork off the screw! You have the grip the cork with your fingers to retract the screw by unscrewing it -- not an easy task for someone with arthritis. Oxo needs to amend the design by adding a clamping ring to grab the cork to ease its removal from the screw. It could easily be a 5-star product if they add this feature."
4,"Great for real corks, not so good for neoprene","The built-in foil cutter and easy-grip handle work great, and it's nice to be able to uncork a bottle with no chance of splashing a drop anywhere. The corks remove very easily without no forcing or yanking. And you have to admit, it's pretty cool-looking. It works much better with real corks than with neoprene (plastic) corks, however; the latter are especially hard to remove from the screw once you've got the bottle open. We've put ours through five years of hard service, and while I imagine the plastic part will eventually be the bit that fails, it hasn't yet. For the price range, it's a pretty good value."
2,This Cork Pull is not very stable.,"I purchased this item and within 2-3 uses it simply fell apart. For the price I paid, I don't think I got a very good product."
1,the impossible corkscrew,"Order this item if you like the idea of having your blood mingled with your favorite wine. While the product's promise of ease in opening a wine bottle proves true, the problem is in removing the cork from the corkscrew thereafter. In my case, not only was I unable to remove the cork from the corkscrew (turning counterclockwise did not work, and there is no space inside the plastic chamber for your fingers to get a grip on the cork) I ended up piercing my finger in an attempt to extract the cork, thus turning wine-drinking into an unsavory and painful experience."
1,This thing is lousy,"I usually love Oxo products, but this one blows. It is without a doubt the worst corkscrew I've ever owned. I don't use it anymore, but when I did, it routinely:. shredded the cork in the mouth of the bottle without removing it. lodged the removed cork inside the corkscrew, making nearly impossible to remove. drilled all the way through corks, leaving cork bits and dust in the wineAlso, the foil cutter is completely worthless.Try a Screwpull or a regular waiter's corkscrew -- either would be a much better choice."
1,a disappointing purchase,"I've used this maybe 5 times, and am going to throw it away. It doesn't always work for cork removal; once it pushed the cork into the bottle. And the method for removing the cork NEVER works. When you end up with a cork stuck on the screw, the plastic guard keeps you from accessing it with your fingers. I often drink wine with plastic corks, so that may be part of the problem. At this point, I can't get a cork off the screw, and it's going into the trash with a cork attached."
4,Had one for years,"I'm over average size, and I like this a lot, use it right on the counter. The cork comes right off again, turning the other way. You do have to hold the lower flange, both during extraction and removal.My wife, who is shorter, finds it easier to use, if she puts the bottle in the sink. I gave up on the foil cutter, was slashing the foil at the bottom with a knife, then peeling it off. My wife picked up a foil cutter in a little plastic box, which solved that problem.I also have a rabbit knock-off. It works great, and came with a foil cutter, but it's too bulky to keep in a primary kitchen drawer.Update 3-6-2010Better, get the new Oxo:Oxo Steel CorkPull Wine Opener/Corkscrew"
2,too bad so sad,"should have listened to the reviewer who said it's hell to get the cork out of the corkscrew. have to be very careful that you don't pull the cork up too far or you'll spend the next minutes looking for a needle nose pliers. they used to make a better one similar but didn't have that problem.i read that review, didn't listen. my bad m.w."
3,handy,"Although the cutter doesn't 'work' easily, necessitating another product to cut the foil; the cork pulling mechanism is fairly smooth and easy. Someone with arthritis may have trouble getting it started though."
4,A Good Buy for the Latin Teacher,"This is a great compilation of Latin adages, some authentic, some invented. Although its practical value is questionable, it is worth its weight in gold to the high school Latin teacher. It lends itself to providing comic, tragic, dirty, and sometimes down-right rotten humor."
3,Interior Graphic and Design Standards,This is a very good book. Deals with the in and out of the interior design standards
1,* WARNING: THIS BOOK'S BEST USE IS AS A DOOR STOP! *,"...so S T O P; don't buy this book. It's Junk. Anyone who's been in the profession a while knows it because many of us received it as a Designer's Book Club intro title in the late 80's or early 90's. It wasn't worth the cost of its S&H! Ask around to people in the profession and look it over first. I received mine while having just a few years of experience in practice. Initally excited and impressed with myself having identifed a clear technical error, my feelings quickly changed to surprise and then anger as I began to realize the whole book was packed w/ errors and critical omissions. It was generally a frustratingly incompetent presentation with widely incomplete information on its proposed subjects. That the editors and publisher let this trash out, and were, I presume, making their livings with this level of incompetence was disheartening."
5,Great guide book for interior designers and students.,"Do you need to have a fundamental guide book for interior design?(I am talking to Interior designers, not interior decorators).Get this book. You will find any information or the specification you need to design your space in this book. From basic space plan rule to good example of space plans by each category, Light specification, Furniture by period and millwork standards, Door specifications, ADA requirement for different conditions, and whatever you need, you will find it.Reznikoff showed his(or her)drawings by each cales, so that you can get the specific dimensions you need from the drawings in this book.Great resource book. You will find this book very useful even when you work like me.This is my interior design bible and I bet it will be same to you."
2,"overrall ok, some teeth marks on binding","overrall in ok condition. had some teeth marks on binding that seller did not add in description but did not effect the overrall quality of the book. the edition did not have the needed scale figures in the drawings and was unaware that there was more than 1 edition type. would have been nice to have more of a description before purchasing. pretty much what was described, since description was brief."
4,"Great, REALLY ADVANCED stories","Each of these stories is a gem. This is some great story-telling, and it's worth the price of the book just to read these masterpieces in English. As literature, this would probably warrant five stars. If your are truly proficient in your German, by all means buy this book.BUT... if you are at more intermediate level you will find this book well beyond your abilities. In my case I know a few thousands words, can hold simple conversations, managed just fine ordering dinner in my last trip to Germany, and do okay with a German comic book. The complex vocabulary and intricate sentance structures were well beyond my grasp.The shortcoming in this case is the reader. If you have been studying German for many years and wish to hone your skills, this book could be for you. If you have been at this for just a couple years, you will only find it frustrating."
5,Great product.,"This is a great book for learning German as its facing page has the English translation. The stories are pretty good, and the book has a bit of history in the forward, so you can learn about a bit of the history of German literature. I would recommend this for anyone learning German or thinking about learning German (or wants to read some short stories from some of the best short story writers in German history)."
3,Short Stories,"Gave it as a gift for someone enthused about learning German. They didn't get much use out of it. I can't offer more than that, sorry."
1,Quiter awful,"I am a german III student,so I am quite proficient in german. I found this book absolutely horrid. The translation was helpful yes, but the stories themselves were grotesque. After reading two of the stories I gave up trying to read a decent story. This book is best used a table decoration rather than reading."
2,Comments from a real witch,"This book was some what imformative, however lacking in accurate statements. Author made various assumptions with nothing to base them on. However it was well written. The few gems of correct info that he did provide were excellent. Though I don't agree with the portrayal of witches in the book, I would recommend reading this for FUN do not take anything he says as the truth and nothing but the truth."
2,Don't waste your money...,I wish there was a return policy. The book covered a lot of material but there wasn't anything new to learn from it. You would be better off spending your money on a .NET magazine subscription. Anything that was written in this book can be found on the web and won't cost you anything.
3,"An average release, but a must have for Common fans","This release is no where as good as Resurrection, but it still gives you a glimpse at the incredible lyrical talent of Common. If you liked his latest (One Day It'll All Make Sense), get Resurrection. If you own Resurrection, get this."
4,Good,I Liked Common when his syles was like it was on this album.He has more explicive lyrics than be. But on ResurectionHe had a totaly different style. But he wasn't consideredGangsta Rap at all.
3,Good Cooler,"Very good compact cooler that is very easy to setup. I find that my temps have decreased some. Be sure to remove paste on the block and put on some AS5 instead. My e6600 OC'ed to 3.4 runs at 40c with intel TAT software. I have this thing set on as cold as it can get all the time. Im happy with the cooling but definitely not amazed. Was figuring on getting much colder than this. Anyways good product with cheapest price I could find was at amazon. Unless I am not setting this up right I would not recommend this product as extreme cooling it is not doing, at least for me. I feel that one could get much better temps with a cheaper solution. Hope this review helps."
5,"Since I need a new full-tower case for a Freezone, what works well?","So far, I haven't found a full-tower case that is known to accept a Freezone with no hassles. My old case only has room for the 6cm fan I installed so there's no way it will work in there. I believe my ASUS P5 DH Deluxe motherboard should have no big install issues. My Core 2 Duo is in serious need of cooling and I don't want to bother just finding a better air solution than my Arctic Cooling Freezer 7 Pro.What cases have you folks put a Freezone into so far, where it fit well and the case closed properly?Thanks..."
2,Make sure your motherboard is compatible!,"I bought this,hoping to reduce the temperatures on my core 2 duo extreme running in an evga 680i motherboard. The evga has a very large chipset heatsink which obstructs the freezone, not allowing me to install it correclty.I attempted to contact the company (coolit) to see if anyone had installed on this motherboard, but received no response. I contacted the retailer I purchased this from, and was informed it could not be returned.caveat emptor"
2,Very disappointing.....,"I expected 60 minutes(as indicated on the box) of expert advice about home preparation. Instead I got 43 minutes(amount of video footage on this tape) of bordom. The female host, whom I noticed was the producer,director, and something else I disremember; droaned on in her monotone manner asking very general and long winded questions.The author of ""Making the Best of Basics"" who was the expert interviewed throughout the video, attempts on several occassions to get into some detail and expound on his comments. The robotic host however, quickly interupts with a follow up comment veiled poorly as a question, thus sealing this videos fate in my opinion.This video is a true stinker...... Instead buy the book ""Boston on Y2k"" by Boston T. Party. This is well thought out, thorough, and a great asset to the library."
5,a must have for old time fiddle jam sessions,This has been a great help to me as I begin my journey into old time fiddle music. Many of the tunes are played in the monthly jam session that I attend.
1,Good music - can't listen to it,"Sound quality is dismal. ""20 bit mastering"" is a joke.No way to tell if the original tape or something after is at fault but if you're expecting anything better than AM radio, look elsewhere."
3,UNDERGROUND STYLE RAP,"I used to own this cd but taped the good stuff and sold. On here, you will find perhaps one of the best beats in music on ""pimp of the year"" everyone loves this song. It's a classic. The other stuff varies but undoubtedly pulles it's weight. I'd reccommend it to anyone who likes real gangster/pimp style rap from Oakland."
3,OXO is better than this,"I have always enjoyed OXO products, but this spoon set includes only 4 measurements. The spoons are dishwasher safe, but the spoons are so light that they tend to be lifted by the stream of water & lost in the bottom of the dishwasher. OXO really makes better products than this."
5,Love this! Helped my Marriage!,"This video series was so helpful to my husband and I! Then years later I passed it on to my daughter and her husband. They loved it, too. Helps you understand the opposite sex better and how to relate to one another in a healthy way. This kind of help never goes out of style."
2,""" The Way It Ain't ""","Monty Alexander is one of the giants of jazz piano. I have a majority of his releases, on CD as well as vinyl. PLEASE AVOID THIS IMPORT "" THE WAY IT IS "". The recording is horrendous, EQ is all wrong, you can't hear drummer Frank Gant, Bob Maize""s bass is too loud in the mix, the tinny, out of tune piano sucks and Monty is just trying to get through the gig! Dont be fooled by the hip cover of Monty strokin' it. This set is not like his great MPS live recordings. Buy any of his legit recordings on major labels, and you will be amazed. Leave this one alone. And yea, I've heard a lot of Monty live, on one occasion (5 nights, 15 sets, back in the day). Long live ""Alexander The Great!"""
5,Stormy Monday may be Claptons greatest recorded guitar solo,This is when Clapton was at the peak of his blues prowess. You don't hear many like this anymore.
4,"The Don Ellis ""Farewell"" Recording","Live at Montreux (1978) was Ellis's final recording. This recording offers reflections of the more adventurous Ellis ensemble recordings on selections such as ""Future Feature,"" ""Sporting Dance,"" and ""Niner Two."" However the disco-influenced ""Go-No-Go"" indicates Ellis's continued connection to popular styles. The selection ""Open Wide"" enjoyed some degree of popularity with its 4/4 meter and accessible main theme (somewhat reflective of Chuck Mangione's hit ""Feel So Good""). Despite the conventional meter, the selection also represents an excellent example of Ellis's rhythmic superimpositions 5 beats over a 4/4 barline.Live at Montreux demonstrates a more-restrained use of Ellis's trademark ""odd"" meters, but makes up for it with a more-liberated use of extremely sophisticated rhythmic superimpositions."
5,American Jazz at its best!,"It blew me away. GREAT inventiveness , great music and a milestone for American jazz."
2,Poorly Designed,"I hate the Harbor Bay line of clothes so much, I should never buy them, but I still do... oh woe is me.To make this long story short:These are standard khaki pants, but when you put them on it feels like they put more material up front near the belly and less in the back so it feels like you need to pull up your pants all the time since they didnt give enough room in the seat or enough fabric up top to feel comfortable. All of the fabric they could have used to cover the small of the back was instead put into clown sized calves that look like balloons and make the pant legs unwearable without further alteration. So purchase these pants, enjoy your trip to the tailor and forever hate them for the rest of their life as your work pants. I swear these are the kind of pants that make you hate your job."
3,Creedence Clearwater Revival REALLY live!!!,"This is the live album to get, if you want to hear CCR really live, playing their songs just like the records, but faster. They were a very 60's type band at heart. Kind of cute in their swamp rock way. Sound quality is good enough. Enjoy an hour of CCR.Essential live albums from the 70's:Deep Purple - Made In JapanThe Who - Live At Leeds"
4,Good,"Speedy delivery, book came in condition as described in the online description of the book, overall I would definitely buy again from buyer."
4,Tweezerman tweezers,I've used Tweezerman tweezers for years so this was just a replacement. The quality was excellent and I would highly recommend these tweezers to everyone. The price at Amazon was great too!
2,Does not grab,This product does not grab hairs very well and make it very difficult to pull ingrown hairs. The point is sharp.
3,Television nostalgia,"Oh boy! To think I watched these shows regularly every week as a kid. It is truly fascinating to revisit your past favourites. All the shows are in black and white on budgets that today would not get you an opening credit on a cheese commercial, yet they definitely have charm. There is minimal violence even though there are sword fights galore, no sex even though Lancelot and Guinevere exchange lots of long glances. English is spoken precisely and with a stiff upper lip at all times. Richard Greene and William Russell (pre Dr. Who) are noble and stalwart with just an occassional tongue in cheek. Ideal for parents who worry about too much violence or sex on the TV today and epitomises what nostalgia is all about. Great value."
4,"Vivid. . . . . draws you right into the ""Old West"".","An exceptional book, quite possibly one of his best. ""Conagher"" brings to life the dangerous and lonely life that was the ""Old West"". This books has it all, from its vivid portrayal of the rugged country and harsh lifestyle, to the characters themselves. L'Amour has a nack for drawing his readers into his stories and making them feel like they are actually there cheering the heroes on."
3,Like the old cowboys -- gritty & terse,"Conagher is the name of the main character in this western by Louis L'Amour. He is a loner, who as he is growing older, needs to find a permanent place to hang his hat.Mrs. Teale, a woman who has been widowed without knowing it, runs a stage way station and dreams of raising cattle when her husband returns with the stock he is supposed to be buying. Taking care of her two step-children, she shows courage and foresight. Once she realizes that her husband is not coming back, she welcomes Conagher into her home and heart.The descriptions of the western landscape and the people who lived there in the late 19th century make this book worth reading."
4,Hilarious.. great for binge watching,"Is it high quality? no. Is it 'must see TV?' not a chance.What it is great for is passing an hour or so with 2 or 3 episodes. If you like SNL and the office, you've probably already seen this. If you haven't, you won't regret it."
4,boosh,Not as good as season three and four but still hilarious. like the office if the office was actually funny. finished the season in like 2 days.
5,Wonderful,Lots of laughter with this show. Great chemistry among all the cast and if you don't enjoy the report between Nick Offerman and Amy Poehler then stop reading this review!
5,great in every way,"You just can't go wrong with Parks and Rec. Acting's flawless, characters are lovable, situations are ridiculous and the whole thing pulls together to become entertainment you can't turn off. Be prepared to watch an entire season in one night, at the risk of your eyeballs falling out. It's worth it. Hats off to Amy Poehler and the gang!"
5,Still Good,"I love this show! After watching Season 2 rather belatedly I have to say the show still holds its own in entertainment value in 2013. Leslie Knope is a great character, as are all the other characters, like April and Tom, Ann and Andy, et al. You will be laughing so hard by the end of season 2 you'll want more seasons, and will, like me, start watching Seasons 3, 4, and 5. Amazon Prime provides good HD quality episodes so long as you have a high enough bandwidth on your internet connection. Enjoy!"
5,Fun in parks,"Pitch perfect scripts, perfect ensemble performances, spot on direction and editing. This is state of the art TV comedy. And great value too, after the cruelly short season one.I guess they needed a bit of time to feel out the bumps. Season one was fine, but it's just an appetiser compared to the sophomore edition."
2,Not So Much,Love the actress/comedian but it didn't hold my interest and I did not finish watching it. Too bad as I heard good things about it.
3,Too much of the shaky-cam and quick-cut stuff made me seasick,"Bought the season two DVD having never seen the show but heard a lot about it, and liked the idea of the show, good premise for a sitcom that at least hasnt been beaten to death, though I suppose it is a bit derivative of Office. The stories are hard to follow though if you are sensitive to shaky-cam and quick-cuts, it seems to be way overused on this show, making it unwatchable for me after 15 minutes, as the car sickness queasiness really got to be too much. What is it with this shaky cam fetish? Is it supposed to be cool or artsy? How about just telling me the story of the gay penguins without all the shaky-cam stuff? Is that too much to ask? Comedies are supposed to be about writing and acting, the camera should be invisible."
4,Still good in the second year,The humour was still strong. I am enjoying the old characters and guest appearances. The story lines are strong and so entertaining.
5,A great show,"Parks and Recreation is one of the funniest shows on tv at the moment. I recently bought seasons 2 and 3 on dvd and was not disappointed. Season 2 is miles better than season one, which was only 6 episodes long and the dvds have loads of extra features.A great buy."
5,My favorite Parks & Rec episode!,"I LOVED this episode! For one, I was a Greg Pikitis, just not as brilliant with my pranks. Two, I can appreciate Leslie's hatred for obnoxious little jerks. Three, I love Dave and thought they were good together - I like Leslie and Ben together, too so it would be interesting to see Dave come back to the show.Ann's party was the best, especially with all her coworkers showing up in their scrubs. I wish Dr. Harris had bigger parts on the show. His sarcasm and indifference are hilarious.I worked security for years and can totally relate to Pikitis' (fake) mom showing up to bail him out. Few parents these days hold their kids responsible for their actions so everything she said was completely believeable. Glad his own mother isn't afraid to ""ring his neck"". If that was real they would probably have CPS at her door."
3,"Great Show, but needs subs.","First off, I'll admit, I love the show. Being able to catch up on early shows that I missed is great.BUT - do not be deceived by the [HD] in the title - if this is HD, then I have to assume the SD version looks like a child's watercolor. Eminently watchable, but a lot of the subtle detail and interplay that can be seen on the LIVE NBC feed is missing here.What's worse is the continued lack of subtitles. Had my Prime account not rolled over when I wasn't watching (be careful - Amazon does NOT notify when this is going to happen,) I wouldn't even be watching. Thanks to a couple benign tumors, I am seriously hearing impaired. There are NO subtitles provided, and the audio quality matches the video quality - poor.I"
2,Good design but poor execution,"These clips are excellent, at least until they break. As a previous reviewer noted, if these clips fall to the floor they tend to break. Within 6 months of buying these clips, every one of these had broken. If you treat them gingerly, you may do well, but I cannot really recommend these until their reliability becomes more consistent. Generally, though, I have always been impressed with other OXO products."
3,Nice Product --Shipped Poorly,"The multi-colored clips work fine. The magnets are convenient and are fairly strong, however one of my clips was damaged beyond repair during shipping due to poor packing. I'd buy them again, although I'm not sure I would purchase them through the mail."
4,"Nice clip, needs stronger magnet.","The clips are great and sturdy. However, about half of the time I open my fridge, at least one of these things flies off, which is really annoying! I love OXO, but these need stronger magnets."
5,Colorful Helpers,These bag clips are very strong and will not break or fall apart as some clips do. They do a great job of holding things together and keeping everything fresh and crisp. The color of the clips just add to the fun of using them. I am very glad I purchased them and have used them for many items.
3,Good Buy!,"Not a bad buy for the money. Handy magnet to leave the clips on your refrigerator, etc. so you won't need to search for them when you need them. Not the best bag seal design clip that I've ever seen but it does the job ...great for unused nachos,chips, whatever."
3,"Nice colors, but better functionality available for less $$","The best bag clips I have used are simply 1-inch binder clips. Available on Amazon at only $3 for a dozen. They're not pretty, but they clamp over a wider area, and hold the fold tight so your chips are always fresh. Search on Amazon for ""Binder Clips, 1"" Capacity, 2"" Wide, Dozen""Fold the bag into a triangle: top right corner to left side, top left corner to right side, then fold the peak down the base, fold the top down to the base again, and clip for an air-tight seal."
2,Service and Quality,"Items were received in a timely manner and in good condition, unfortunately they do not hold up too well. Most of them came apart or broke in two to three months. I would not buy this item again. Do yourself a favor and get the steel spring clips they sell for use in offices to hold papers together. Check on AMAZON.com; I am sure they have them. If they don't, go to Staples or some other office supply company."
5,Best Clips Ever,"We received these as a wedding gift and they are the best clips. I always choose these over any others that we have. They feel very sturdy, hold well, and have not lost their springiness. We keep them on the refrigerator when not in use and the magnets hold up well. Never had one fall off or anything. Something about them is just superior to others. We even have some other OXO ones that are not as good as these. I couldn't find them on amazon but they are the same colors, just look more like a clothespin shape."
2,Clips break easily,"Due to the weak magnet on these clips, they are easily knocked off the fridge door. Two of my four clips have already broken from hitting the floor...and my floor is soft linoleum, not tile."
2,Suggested Alternative,"I gave up on plastic chip clips after my mom showed me an obvious improvement: Binder clips. All metal construction, and a box of 12 costs less than just one of these plastic clips. I use them everywhere. Only loss is that they don't have magnets on them."
2,Not as good as Binder Clips,"I bought these, but there not as strong as Binder Clips, that I bought at the stationary store, and the binder clips are alot Less money, and you get a box of them, not just 4...I don't keep a bunch of junk cliped on my refigerator, so I kept these OX0 clips in the drawer, they also take up more space then the Binder Clips do...I'm not impressed with these clips.But I gave them a 2 star for color!!! Big deal lol..."
3,Gloves,"Great for the Price, and I was given excellent customer service when I reported that the gloves showed to have been received they offered to replace free of charge, they didn't have to because I finally received them a few days later. great seller."
4,Well worth the money!,These gloves are a nice addition to the Captain America childs costume. I highly recomend them. Dont waste your money on the matching boot covers.
2,Captain America Gloves,"The gloves are made from cheap thin foam material. My 4 year old played with them a few times. He has the Captain America shield too, which he loves."
4,Good for cheap,"My son loves superheroes, and is on a Cap kick right now. He loves these gloves. They're pretty thin on the hand part and a bit cheesy. But for the price you really can't go wrong."
5,Great for little one's imagination,"Bought these for a grandson to complete the Captain America ""look"". They were a hit and fit his 5 year old hands well. I think the fit would work for younger children as well as older ones. The glove part is made of fabric and the sleeve is made of a rubbery material."
3,The fit is a little off,These fit very big for a 3 year old and then the cuffs are very over-sized. I couldn't convince my picky 3 year old to even put them on. I guess he put them on with my husband before i got home and he got frustrated from them being so big and akward and then wouldn't even put them on for me for 1 picture. They would probably fit a 5 year old ok.
2,You get what you pay for...,"I've had it for 3 months and that ""antique-look"" is discolored and all except one gem has fallen off. I guess this is good for you if you like disposable jewelry."
5,Better than the Lilith CDs!,"I love this cd and i only bought it for 99 cents at hastings! I could listen to a couple of songs i liked here and there on the lilith cds,k but this really made women's music strong enough to make me want to listen to the whole cd. I highly recommend it."
2,IT TAKES A THIEF,"AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT RUTH PRICE IS!THAT LITTLE JAZZ CLUB THAT RUTH OWNS (THAT SHE PASSES OFF AS) ANON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION IS ANYTHING BUT NON-PROFIT. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN THIS WOMEN WHO CALLS HERSELF A MUSICIAN, AND YET RIPS OFF EVERY MUSICIAN WHO PASSES THROUGH THE JOINT. SHE IS NOT WORTHY OF ANY FORM OF RESPECT, BECAUSE SHE HAS NO RESPECT FOR HARD WORKING STRUGGLING MUSICIANS, WHOM SHE NICKELS AND DIMES TO DEATH. THE JAZZBAKERY IS A SHAM, AND RUTH PRICE OUGHT TO HANG HER HEAD IN SHAME!"
2,The book was too slow for real enjoyment.,I read the book for a class assignment and was bored to sleep. The plot was interesting but it was too drawn out.
3,"Interesting, yet unfortunately out-dated concept","Although an interesting read, the story did not age well with time due its popularity and how familiar many are to the ending twist. One of the most well known stories in English literature, ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" delves into the duality of man - of good and evil - in a fascinating, hocus-pocus sort of way."
3,good book or bad book to read,"Dr.Jeckle and Mr Hide is a very complikated book so if you dont like complicatedbooks then it is not a book for you, i didnt like it but it was a pleasent book to read.on a scale to one to ten i would say it was a seven. It is about a sientistthat drinks a potion and turns into a beast. Because he thinks it will turn him in a superhero.If you have seen the league of extrordinary gentlemen, he is the man that turnsinto the giant beast.That is all i can tell you i dont wont to spoil anything for you so i hop i like the book if you read it.by sean"
2,"Don't buy, you are being cheated.","This publication has long since been public domain and unless you are purrchasing this for a good cause, you are wasting your money. If you want this publication FOR FREE, kindleclassics.org is a good place to get it. The formating is very easy to read (unlike this particular copy, as it doesn't have any quotation marks at all). The only disadvantage with using kindleclassics.org is you have to connect your kindle to your computer in order to get them on your kindle, but it's a very easy plug and play operation."
3,Nothing special,"While many extol the supposed virtues of this novella as either a great gothic story, or insightful social commentary, I found neither. Rather, it is a tale of Dr Jekyll, a man who invents a potion that allows him to transform himself into a more assertive, albeit fiendish being (Mr. Hyde) for a small period of time where his original personality is suppressed. These periods grow longer as Jekyll loses control etc. etc. It's not a bad concept but I found it not to be much more deep than that - it seemed kind of on the same level as spin-off versions of the concept, like the film ""The Mask"".This had the potential to be a much more punchy, psychological story but psychology is not Stevenon's special trademark. The result is simply a good (not great) and not particularly memorable novella - at least it wasn't memorable for me."
3,Stevenson,"Undoubtedly a great story this was. Stevenson couldn't have done a better job in telling the story of these two individuals trapped in the body of one. The concept is of an awesome nature, and so is the story.Now, many people that have never read this think it to be a horror tale. This is indeed true - some of this story is horror. But more than a horror tale, this is a psychological mystery. The way it begins, the way many of the mysteries unfold throughout the story have all the nature, the characteristics, the makings of a mystery. Thus, upon reading this book, you must pay careful attention to all that's going on. If you don't pay attention to a certain detail, you may get very mixed up and lost. It is easy to understand why many different versions have been written for kids.The last part of the book is just wonderful. The book, though it may not be the funnest thing to read, is all worth reading for the ending. The ending is one that will stand high in literature."
5,Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde,"A classic, without doubt, purchased for a 13-year-old who loves to read. Schools should assign this."
4,Excellent Classic to re-read..,This bok is the original book on this very well known tail about Dr. Jekyll and his evil alter ego Mr Hyde.This book gives a very psychological version of the story and less focused on the actual killing portion. The first part of this book is a little long but the story gets better until the end where everythins is divulged.
4,A story from the creepy basement of human nature,"One of those stories that you know the gist of, but don't know where it came from. Or, like me, you associate it with the old Bugs Bunny episode -- which in fact captures some essential details of the story. Worth reading and re-reading; the more you read it the deeper you'll follow it into the depths of human nature. The creepy part of nature. The places in the basement you usually avoid because of the darkness and rats and monsters."
3,Requires the right ambiance,"Hands up if you knew this book was written by Robert Lewis Stevenson! I didn't. Here's another thing I didn't know: it's really short - almost a novella. One and a half trips to work, and it was over.The book itself was okay, but would have been infinitely better had I read it with the right ambiance. Listening to this book on a car radio, whizzing down the highway at 70 mph in the morning sunlight does not do the book justice. Instead, one should listen to it on a dark night in a log cabin, by gas-lantern light. With such an ambiance, one might put oneself in the time period in which it was written, and loose oneself in the haunting imagery it tries to convey. Otherwise, I'm afraid that in this age of terrorism, school shootings, and lost innocence, Mr. Hyde seems like a pretty mellow guy.'"
3,Jekyll and Hyde,The novel Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was not that intersting to me. It however was great in making you think of how often a person lets their emotions get the better of them. If a person wants to read a book that gives insite of the strugle one person went through with their good and evil side then this is the book to read. However if you want a book that flows great and can be understood at first glance than you might want to think twice about this book. I recomend this book only because it is so widely known and it gives a good account of ones stugle between a person they should be and the person the would like to be.
3,Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde-A Bantam Classic,"The classic Dr. Jekyll and Mr. HYde by the famous author Robert Louis Stevenson with an afterword by Jerome Charyn,was quite hard to understand. As most novels usually start hard to understand, the end was just as hard to as well. The old english in this novel was probably not as hard to understand while it was still being spoken when this book was published in 1886, but over 100 years later, the language got me off track. Although I had liked the plot of a scientist by day, evil character by night, everything just seemed too hard to comprehend."
3,My Review,The book was a pure twist to the end. It had so many twist and turn that at points it was hard to follow. The parts I did get lead me on a path though the human mind that I have never felt before. It was definently a shocker the way Dr. Jekell precived his actions and attempted to solve the problem. Overall I struggled with intrest in it and would only recomend this book to people with true open minds and can easily precieve fiction.
2,A Slight Boring,"This book was boring for me, but I think I may enjoy it a bit more when I am older. I read it because it was the same author as had done Treasure Island, which I thought was brilliant."
5,great book,my mom read this to me when I was young and it was amazing. It has what every good reader looks for. The plot and mystery is just outstanding.
3,More of an Idea than a Story,"I've never read a novel or novella where there is so little of actual story as there is Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde; where there is so little done with such an amazing idea. The story consists mainly of a few rumors and incidents and annecdotes that are all tied together by the ""full statement of the case"" at the end, and that's it. For one thing I think this sparseness contributes to the eeriness of the story. The book reads more like a police report that a horror story, leaving Mr. Hyde to lurk almost unseen in the shadows of its pages. For another thing I think that this book has been popular through the years and passed through so many incarnations and popped up in so many different forms precisely because Stevenson did so little with Mr. Hyde. It was like he left a blueprint for other writers to come along and fully explore the ramifications of this book's intriquing premise."
2,Disappointing,I suppose I have been spoiled by the theatrical version. Typically the written version includes so much more detail. In this case it was the opposite.
3,Short an Fast!,Didn't realize this novel was so short. It was a fast read but I only gave it 3 stars as I'm not a fan of reading the Victorian English way of writing. I'd still recommend it however.
3,Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a book about a doctor who separates his evil self from his good self. He creates a potion that changes him from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde. Dr. Jekyll is a well respected doctor in London. He is a good hearted man. Mr. Hyde is a cruel and insaine murder. He has a deformity but no one is able to describe it.I belivie that every one has a good and a bad side. One side is shown a lot more than the other side. I do not understand why someone would try to separate their good from their bad. If it were possible, many people would try to separate their to sides, and if they did, then if our bad side is like that of Mr. Hyde, there would be a lot crimes to day."
2,"Great Plot, but the narrative could be a lot better!!","The book, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde has a great plot, but it could be written better. Also, the book is somewhat hard to understand because it is written in an older form of English. The author, Robert Louis Stevenson, does however do a good job of describing the setting. The story takes place in the late 1800's in London, England."
3,"Good, but a little disappointing","I thought that Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde was rather a dull book. It didn't have any lowpoints or strainings of any sort but rather, too much a monotonous tone that is just not quite right. I think that maybe I was expecting a little too much, but still I thought it wasn't as good as I was told. It was well written, the style was OK, the problem was the way the story was built. The idea of someone changing his physical appearance is a good one, but I think it should have gone a little deeper in the minds of the person that experiences it. Instead the other chose to show us a friend of that person, and, for me, it lost most of it's interest. I would have liked to be with Dr Jekyll as he drank his potion to ""see"" how it happened and all.It's not a bad book, it's just not a great book either. A good book that doesn't have everything it takes to become a great book."
1,Took too long,waste of time and energy to order....took way tooooo long to come. i went and bought it at barnes and noble. my child's assignment was due the day it was delivered.
3,Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,I read this book for my senoir lit class. I enjoyed it. It was not what I was expecting. I thought that Dr. Jekyll's transformation was magical but it turned out to be logical and even more enjoyable. I liked it and I would recommend it to other senoir lit classes.
3,reader,"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is an excellent read. It is very short and takes no time to read cover to cover, so you never have to stop at a nail biting part. It is a mystery and a horror. Stevenson did an awsome job with this novel. It shows how people have a good side and a bad side and how people can enjoy doing evil. All people have evil thoughts but Dr. Jekyll found a way to use his thoughts instead of keeping them in. The novel also shows how evil can take over our lives. I highly recommend the reading of this novel."
3,Not as horrifying as I thought,"I thought this book had very little horror in it at all. Even in the 1800s, when Robert Louis Stevenson wrote it, I still don't see how it could be horrifying to people in those days. I thought this book did not have black and white answers to questions. I also thought this book was way to long with 54 pages. I think it could have been put into a 20-page book and still have the same content of a 54-page book. I think that this was also very boring. I mean the best part was when Dr. Lanyon wrote that Mr. Hyde came to his house, mixed up a potion, and he turned into Dr. Jekyll. That has very little excitement to it. When I was going to read this book I thought it was going to be very scary and that I would be on the edge of my seat. Well neither of those things happened. In fact I just wanted to get the book finished so I could start a more exciting book. Those are my feelings on the book The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."
4,Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde,"Dr.Henery Jeckyll, a respected doctor and scientist is sure that everyone has a split personality inside them. He makes a drug to seperate one man into two totally different personalities. He tests the drug on himself, and kind Dr.Jekyll becomes the vicious, murderous Mr.Hyde. Will Dr.Jekyll destroy his dark side, or will he become Hyde's next victim? Read this book to find out. When you read this book, think,Do we all have a Mr.Hyde in us?"
3,I preferred the plot in the musical,"After becoming involved with a production of Jekyll & Hyde, the musical, in the local community theater, I decided to re-read the original novel by Stevenson. In the book Jekyll/Hyde admits that he had no honorable motive for the transformations (other than curiosity). In the musical he is experimenting to develop a treatment or cure for his father's mental illness. Also, in the book there are no major female characters like the fiancee, dance hall girl(s), etc. If you are familiar with the Broadway show the original book might be a disappointment, but read it anyway. It is a classic and the commentaries at the beginning and the end of the edition for sale on Amazon.com effectively put the cultural signifcance of the plot of the novel into perspective."
4,Very good Book,"This one is a classic, and it comes with a review from some other professor that takes up a good portion of the pages. I liked it though, for that because it made me feel like I got through it faster because I got to skip a bunch!"
4,"The story has passed into mythology, but VERY old-fashioned style.","As I say, very old-fasioned. I decided to actually read the book to see if Stevenson's writing matched up to ,say, ""Treasure Island"" It doesn't. For the lurid subject matter, there's not much tension there."
3,A Thriller Past It's Prime,"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde used to be known as a ""Shilling Shocker."" For many years, it certainly was a ""shocker"" but by contemporary standards it is certainly past it's prime. I still found it very intriguing (it could be considered the world's first psychological thriller). The manner in which Stevenson writes is very fitting to The Strange Case. It is interesting to mentally piece together all of the parts which Stevenson includes. For anyone who is willing to put themselves in another time period, the book should be great. It's most interesting component is the way the ""mystery"" is presented, through the eyes of an attorney. Nothing is clear, everything is left to be interpretted by the reader. This clouded view makes the book as mysterious as it is. Throughout most of the story, it is unclear if Dr.Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are one. A disturbing link is always portrayed between the two however."
4,Worth the read,"I always thought I knew this story just because the idea of having a dual personality is an idea with which a lot of us can relate. I knew that the story was about a doctor who made some potion of sorts that turned him into an unscrupulous man. But there were several things that I learned from taking the short amount of time to read this story. I did not know that the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was being told in the aftermath of the confusion of it all. I discovered that there were deep of emotions and grief tied to Dr. Jekyll's decisions and actions. I also learned that Hyde was the complete picture of the devil on our shoulder. So for knowing what the book was about, I was missing key pieces that I found delighting to discover while reading it for myself. I would recommend it. I have the Cricket House Books publication of it myself.The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. HydeIt is compact and was easy to carry along in my purse."
5,"Intriguing story, refreshing style","Like most who pick up this book today, I was familiar with the feature character(s) in this story, but I was a bit surprised by the brevity and the suspenseful nature of the writing. I can only imagine reading this book when it was first written, before the idea of a split personality had really been explored in literature. I would have been on the edge of my seat. Even now, though I knew the answer to the riddle as I read, I was close to the edge of my seat. Stevenson's writing style and vocabulary are refreshing as he moves the story along at just the right pace. A necessary addition to every classic literature repertoire."
2,Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde-one of a kind,"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is one of a kind. I could not get very interested in the book because I am not in to science fiction novels. Another reason I did not enjoy it is because it was kind of scary with all of the killilng and evil. It did have a plot that could keep a readers attention, but it was too evil to keep it very long. Personally I did not take very well to the fact that that the evil side was brought out in such a good man. I do not recommend reading Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde unless you enjoy mystery and science fiction."
1,huh,Don't remember getting this. Good book regardless. Guess it was from a mobile app. Anyways I do recommend it still. Enjoy
2,Poorly written,This book was a dull book to read! After reading the first page and a half I stopped. I could'nt stand the notion of reading that stuff for so many pages. I gave it two stars because I'm sure its a classic and all that stuff. Save some time and money and read something from this century!
4,The review,"The Strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde maintained my interest throughout the whole book. Dr. Jekyll is a respected man in the community. Friends become concerned when Mr. Hyde begins to prowl around the residence of Dr. Jekyll. This is because Mr. Hyde has been seen and suspected in many crimes around the city. Theories develop concerning the whereabouts of Dr. Hekyll when he places himself into seclusion. The question arises if he must destroy himself before Mr. Hyde destroys him. Could this monster, Mr. Hyde, be the creation of Dr. Jekyll or is he being blackmailed. For the answer read this interesting book."
5,"A Strange, yet Great Case.","I bought this same books a while ago. I've always heard about this story in movies, TV and so one. When I came across this book I had to get it. They say never judge a book by its cover, but in this case I did. The look of the book echoes books of the eighteen hundreds. The silver shine on the edges of the pages plus its own bookmark just made me want it more.The classic horror story of Dr. Henry Jekyll and Mr. Edward Hyde gave people around the world nightmares for over one hundred and twenty-five years as well as the writer himself.This is one book like Dracula and Frankenstein you must have for your book collection. No collection is complete without it.Trust me, you'll enjoy it as much as I did."
4,A fascinating read...,"I definitely recommend this as a quick, but fascinating read. It's not only thought-provoking, discussion-lending and well-written, but in the case of this copy, aesthetically pleasing and really well designed by Cricket House Books. Stevenson creatively captures the essence of so much human struggle - the capacity for both good and evil within each human being - and the tragic consequences that result when evil is given sway. It would be an appealing choice for teen and adult readers or book clubs."
3,Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,A nice quick and easy read. The Kindle version is nice quality. Would recommend to any book lover or someone simply looking for a good book to read during vacation.
3,Free Book,Kept me interested. I really enjoyed this book. It is a must read. It was what you can expect for free. just got a lot of free books.
5,Dr. Jekell and Mr. Hyde,"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was an awesome book. It was so awesome because it was so visual. What I mean by this is that all through the book, even though the characters in the novel were not able to describe him, it was written in a way that I was able to picture Hyde's face. I could just see his ugly face.Also, the idea of someone who is able to change themselves completey by just drinking a potion is an awesome concept(although the change was not what Dr. Jekyll wanted). I also enjoy the fact that the main character kills himself in the end. That doesn't happen in most stoies and it gave this story a great twist.I wouldn't change a thing about this book and would reccommend to any reader Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."
3,A truly overlooked classic,Easily the most misrepresented story in Hollywood. It was a treat to discover the true story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Highly recommended.
2,Boring,It was good for the most part but it needed more action! I'm like sitting there not bed and reading the book and it was good got through the first 2 chapters then it got boring but this is just my opinion!
4,Good but...,"I love this book, it is a great piece of literature. I love Utterson, I pity Jeckyll, and I pity Hyde. I still find it weird, to this day, how movies, television and other visual media always depict Hyde as a large and monstrously when he is Cleary described as much smaller than Jeckyll.Aside from all that, I always had wished it moved a little faster and there was a bit more adventure to it. The mystery/thriller aspect was always great, but I am sure it was much more enjoyable in the time period it was published to not know Hyde and Jeckyll were the same person until reading Lanyon's letter to Utterson.A great classic, reads pretty straight forward a with great imagery and suspense."
2,Mmmm...,this book is not bad but i didn't really like it... the book is pretty confusing it has twists and turns and you don't know what your reading anymore..altogether it wasn't horrible though....if you are older you will probably like the book because you will be able to understand it but its not very interesting.
4,"""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde""","""Dr. Jekylll and Mr. Hyde"" was a great book . There were times when it got a little hard to follow but if you keep reading it will make sense in the end. Stevenson did a great job writing this novel. The novel is filled with adventure and nail-biting horror. I highly recomend this book to other readers. Even people who don't like reading will enjoy this novel. I really enjoyed this book because it kept me interested."
3,Adolescent,"Hands down, Stevenson's prose is special, however I would suggest if you are coming to this book in a later stage in life, you may want to bypass it, and study Frankenstein. It is a matter of relationships and character centers and themes too young in the former, which are quite similar really, yet more mature in the latter."
2,yikes,Finally a scary book that I enjoyed. It was full mystery and exitment. You have to read this book. I just loved it.
3,"It's a classic, even though you probably know the story...","Most people already know the general plot, so I will skip a plot summary, If you're in school and this is manditory reading, I would say ""that's fine, have fun with it"" Otherwise Stevenson's storytelling style is mundane compared to even some of the books from his time, and if you know the story of Jekyll and Hyde, there's really no surprise factor to look forward to. It's always going to be a classic, and the duality of humanity (good and evil) in many ways is explored for the first time, and that is a theme that will live forever and keep this story a classic. But if you could read anything you want, I would look elsewhere, storytelling has evolved thanks to classic authors like Stevenson paving the road for more complex stories and adventures. The good/evil duality, & humans shapeshifting has been redone many times and some of the new stuff out there is just more fun to read than this."
3,This book is suppose to be a horror story...,"I thought this book had very little horror in it at all. Even in the 1800s, when Robert Louis Stevenson wrote it, I still don't see how it could be horrifying to people in those days. I thought this book did not have black and white answers to questions. I also thought this book was way to long with 54 pages. I think it could have been put into a 20-page book and still have the same content of a 54-page book. I think that this was also very boring. I mean the best part was when Dr. Lanyon wrote that Mr. Hyde came to his house, mixed up a potion, and he turned into Dr. Jekyll. That has very little excitement to it. When I was going to read this book I thought it was going to be very scary and that I would be on the edge of my seat. Well neither of those things happened. In fact I just wanted to get the book finished so I could start a more exciting book. Those are my feelings on the book The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."
4,A Good Quick Read,"Mr. Hyde is a known murderer. Dr. Jekyll is a honorable doctor in the scientific community. These people's lives should never cross, but why is Hyde the heir of Dr. Jekyll. This book by Robert Luis Stevenson ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", focuses on the duality of man and Jekyll's beleif that the evil in a man can be seperated from the good. This classic book can be read in as little as an hour and is a peice of literature that can surprise you in many ways. This book is not wriiten as poetry and as hard to read as The Odessy or Shakespeare. This book will make you think"
4,Free SF Reader,"A scientist events a formula that can bring out man's dual nature. His opposite number, in this case, is somewhat of super-powered wanton, who does whatever he likes. Free of the social restraint of his other half, he happily commits any crime that comes to mind as he feels like it.Eventually, investigators begin to suspect something, and a hunt is on."
4,Super Reader,"A scientist invents a formula that can bring out man's dual nature. His opposite number, in this case, is somewhat of super-powered wanton, who does whatever he likes. Free of the social restraint of his other half, he happily commits any crime that comes to mind as he feels like it.Eventually, investigators begin to suspect something, and a hunt is on for who is behind it."
4,important critique of science and nature,juxtapose this with darwinian theories. Also check out frankenstein - i thought it was better but jekyll is shorter if have time constraints
4,duality indeed,"Short, symbolic and poignant. Very efficient and entertaining, excellently portrays good and evil, substance and appearance, truth and hypocrisy in this very dramatic story."
3,A very short classic,"If you have watched tv shows doing adaption of this it is wrong. It is not exactly from Dr. Jekylll/Mr. Hyde's viewpoint (until the end), but from a friend. It is a very quick read, but does get dull at points with every scene being detailed immensely (but not as bad as Treasure Island, which at times is unbearable)."
1,Item NEVER received,"I did not receive this item. The other item I ordered was shipped separately and it was received, but this one was not. What a ripoff."
1,all about dr. jekyll and mr. hide,"In the commencement Mr. Utterson and his cousin Mr. Richard Enfield were walking throughout London. The men go by a mysterious cellar door, and then Mr. Enfield talked about a story that ensue here previously. Also later in the book Utterson work to help Dr. Jekyll from being brung into the ghastly tribulations of Mr. Hydes. One year later, Edward Hyde viciously murders Sir Danvers Carew by thrashing him to death with a cane.I did not like this book because it was a high level booklover so I could not concentrate. I'd propose this book for high scholar for that reason, and if you're a person who reads allot. The genre was good because it was sci-fi and it seems sci-fi is a little more addicting. The author is a pretty well known writer his name is Robert Louis Stevenson."
2,Soooooo Boring!!!!!,"This is one of the hardest and boring books in life! It deals with strict men of Science, for instance, Dr. Hastie Lanyon. This book, like the Invisible Man, is a novel that has WAY too many details and should be strictly enforced not to be read. Who wants to read a book about science-fiction and not to mention the cuss words on every page? Who likes minor details around every corner. But, I must admit, there are fabulous descriptions of the characters and them themselves are quite interesting! But, this book is not good."
2,tiny print,The print in the Dover Thrift Edition is half the size of a normal paperback. I find it very difficult to read
5,Psychological Classic!,"I have been fascinated by the concept of this classic work of Stevenson for years, but never took time to read it until now. It is a very quick, easy read, more like a short story than an actual novel. Some persons have misunderstood this book as a detective mystery rather than a psychological reflection upon the dual natures residing within every person. Stevenson here strikes a chord within us all by illustrating the potential darkness and evil of even the most exemplary of individuals.The introduction by Vladimir Nabokov, included with this version, is best read after the story itself. Nabokov's analysis is difficult to follow if the reader is not acquainted with the details of the plot. He provides valuable, thought-provoking insights into what Stevenson has accomplished in this timeless tale.I strongly recommend this classic to pastors, psychologists, and other persons who are interested in learning more about the struggle between good and evil within each human being."
3,short story,I took Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde out of the library expecting a thick volume to sink my teeth into but instead got a short scary little story.This is definitely worth a read though and I enjoyed it very much. I can't say much without giving it away but if you liked Frankenstein by Mary Shelley then I recommend this.
4,mysterious,"I really enjoyed reading this book. At first it was very boring but after Stevenson introduced all the characters it began to be more interesting. This book has a lot of confusing events but you just have to stick with it until the end. Everything unravels at the end. I liked the mystery and the who done it kind of effect. I enjoy reading suspense type books such as this one. I beleive that some of the chracters in the book such as Utterson and Lanyon kind of suspect that they are the same person, but they just don't think that it could be possible. I think that they suspect it mainly because when Dr. Jekyll left his will and everything he has ever owned to Mr. Hyde it just didn't seem right. The way the crimes were commited were especially heinous during that period in time. I would recommend anyone who enjoys a suspenseful book to look into this one."
4,Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde Banks Co. Ga.,I read Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in my senior literature class. It was a very interesting book. It is truely a mystery because you never know what will happen next. I would reccomend others to read this novel because it is an unusual story. The whole time you think one thing will happen but the outcome is totally opposite from what is expected. It is truely a good book and everyone should read it if they get the chance.
3,A classic reading experience,"All my life I have heared and seen movies about Dracula, Frankenstein and Dr. Jekell and Mr. Hyde. Normally I don't read horror/ science fiction, but I was curious about these three and decided to find out how these literary characters attained such long lasting lives. The time spent reading was worth it. It was an entertaining cultural experience. I'll leave it to the experts to try to tell you why they are classics. I do not know, but if you are always short on time like I am, my preference is lisred above."
4,Dark Classic,"Although we all know the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, you don't really know it until you read it. I was surprised to find out how different reading the book was compared to the various TV and popular portrayals. It's somewhat along the lines of Frankenstein and Dracula although not quite as dark. It's an intriguing story but also carries an underlying moral. The moral focuses on the good and bad parts of human nature. The part that we allow to grow is the part that ultimately takes control. For Dr. Jekyll, he allowed his bad nature (Hyde) to overpower his good nature (Jekyll) and eventually succumbed. A quick and interesting read."
4,"A quick read, but worth it!","This story is such a part of our culture that so many people ""know"" it without reading it. I did not realize how short this book is, yet this does not take away from its impact. Yes, this could be a story about split personalities, but it's more than that. It's a book on morality and what would happen if we gave in to every evil thought we ever had. The theme is timeless and so this book will remain a classic. Thanks for presenting the book without the ""fluff"" of scholarly introductions that sometimes get in the way of the reader forming their own opinion of what the book means. I also appreciate the symbolism of the cover."
4,Very good book,I though over all this was a very good book. I unfortunately all ready knew who Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde where so I could all ready fess the ending but over all I thought it was a good book
4,There's nothing like the real thing,"I have read or seen performed several different versions of the Jekyll and Hyde story, but none of them compare to the original short novel. Usually extra characters and subplots are introduced, but in Stevenson's story the plot is simple and the characters few. Stevenson had a gift for characterization, and one can't help but pity Jekyll after reading his final confession."
5,Intriguing,"This book was entirely engrossing. It kept my attention constantly. In many ways it can be paralelled to Oscar Wilde's ""The Picture of Dorian Grey"". Jekyll and Hyde was an adept look at the nature of Victorian Society. It touched on such issues as the importance of appearance and the inevitable consequences of one's actions. It was incredibly compelling, and had no boring sections (like Dorian Grey did). An excellent novella and a very good read!"
3,What i think about the strange case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde,This book was a very good book it was not as good as treasure island another book by Robert Louis Stevenson. The plot is very well done even though some parts were hard to understand.
3,Review,"This must have been an abridged version of this book. I liked this book, but was expecting more details and would have enjoyed a longer book."
5,Jekyll & Hyde...in preparation,"I purchased this short story by R.L. Stevenson because I will be seeing the musical soon, and wanted to read its origins. It's a fascinating psychological tale.The ""revisal"", starring Constantine Maroulis and Deborah Cox, is touring the country September, 2012 through March, 2013 and landing on Broadway in April 2013.Go to JekyllandHydeMusical(dotcom) !"
3,"Good book, poor edition","Dover Publications has a curious inclination toward publishing classic masterpieces in disgraceful editions. Dover Thrift Editions, in particular, carry this tendency. These books are usually about as thin and flimsy as your everyday mousepad. While holding them, they remind you of the cheap programs you receive at baseball games or concerts - although even these programs at least *look* better than the Dover disgraces. I mean, can you honestly glance at the cover of this thing and not have an internal urge to puke?_The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_ is a masterful story. I absolutely love it. But while holding this particular volume, it didn't feel masterful - it felt cheap, like a low-class mystery. Sure, the book only costs a buck, but this edition is practically blasphemous to Mr. Stevenson's good name. Have the decency to purchase a quality edition."
5,A Worthy Endeavor,"To fashion a vessel of vice so that one may drink deeply and anonymously from it is a theme with Victorian resonance. It is also the lasting impression one has on reading the story of Jekyll. Familiarizing oneself with his ignominious fate is not only a worthy endeavor, but this version of it for your Kindle provides you the perfect sojourn for doing it. Only a table of contents is lacking, but the brevity of the tale leaves it hardly missed."
2,A Confusing classic about the split personalities of mankind,This classic tale by Robert Louis Stevenson has been read by people all over the world. I found the book extremly hard to understand. It is written in an old english style and jumps around alot. It goes from describing a scene of one thing and then jumps to another topic completely. I thought this was an ok book for it's time but is too confusing for the modern day passive reader.
1,ha,This was a big waste of time no a great read just the same boring stuff i weould not read this book again.
5,One of the best reggae themed movies ever!,"Countryman is a glimpse into the world of a small fishing village in Jamaica. Its based on the the life of the main actor in the movie, with a hollywood twist to make it more interesting. While its not the most rasta movie out there, you can't help but love countryman. Really a classic reggae film."
3,Handsome One,"If something was good in this movie, it is Countryman himself, his physics and general appearing.A story of drug-smugglers saved miraculously by an indigenous fisherman-witch for a reason to stuff off brutal authorities, probably.It is an informative work of Jamaica, sexy also no sex, neither much music nor factotum but a poor countryman in nice Speedos and some money-bribery in a lap."
3,B grade plot but A grade Rasta magic,"For serious fans of Reggae, Rasta, Jamaica and natural mysticism Countryman is well worth viewing. Unfortunately the plot and style is kitsch '70s, a little B grade even.What saves it is the wicked Reggae, the heart warming Rasta community and the funky shamanic magic of Countryman himself. Countryman is a groovy natural mystic. There is some good acting from some of the Jamaicans and some appaling acting from the two white actors!"
1,Problem with Rasta accuracy and animal killing,"First, real Rastas don't eat scavenger sea life like lobsters, but there it was in this movie getting scarfed. Rastas are vegetarians. And what was with the owl, it ended up dead near the end of the movie, and it looked like a REAL dead owl! Did they murder that majestic bird to make this movie? The headless dead chicken was real, did they kill that too for the movie? Where was the animal respect in this movie that Rastas practice? I had high hopes for this movie, I'm really sorry that I even watched it."
4,Glad to see it on DVD,"So happy to see this finally come to dvd. I remember seeing this on Vhs when I was a young girl. I hated to see they had to add subtitles that were not quite true in translation. The moive is not hard to understand if you are realy paying attention. They are so many moives to watch, The Lunatic, Smile orange, Shottas, Klash, Third World cop, Dancehall Queen, and Belly. Any body know where I can get The Lunatic ? please let me know. I have seen it once in the UK and Have the book."
5,Cuántos divinos pecados,"""Al otro lado"" revela a una narradora de cualidades inhabituales mediante un texto de insólita inventiva. A través de una serie de confesiones en una iglesia alegorizada y fantasmal, se nos narra aquí, desde la gestación y nacimiento de la protagonista hasta sus amores y disidencias en una nunca nombrada pero fácilmente identificable isla del Caribe, una trayectoria de deseo, rebeldía y transgresión, en la que los personajes toman sucesivamente nombres simbólicos que son máscaras transparentes (Juana de Arco, Calígula, Tristán, entre otros) y el lenguaje consigue poner en pie un mundo casi palpable de imágenes y sensaciones que literalmente parece tocar el lector."
4,"""pop"" is good!","This CD has the attributes of being thoughtful & catchy at the same time. Mattias Olsson (of progressive band Anglagard) and his wife have made some very engaging - if not ""timeless"" - pop music. The inclusion of some non-""pop"" instrumentation furthers their cause. This is hummable and memorable stuff & should appeal to fans of Anglagard as well as fans of Kate Bush!"
5,A classic hand-on play book,"Our family loved this book when I was a kid, and I am now the lucky owner of our family copy which I use with my own children. Our all-time favorite is the spider web room! All activities use common household items, so it's the perfect antidote to those ""I'm bored!"" moments all of us parents dread. The photos are very 70's, but the activities and games are timeless. A younger child will need some help, but older kids should be able to do most on their own."
5,Very informative,"I thought, being a huge Queen fan, that I would be bored because I knew everything there is to know about the band. But, I was pleasantly surprised from footage, interviews and information that even I didn't know. It would make a Queen fan very happy, indeed."
5,Extremely interesting idea for a documentary.,"Not your normal look at the life of the band but more a focus on their music. A group of well known artists and music insiders basically review the bands music and analyse it, mainly the 1970s. The film also includes some great early footage of Queen and has some fantastic interview clips from that time. I enjoyed this film immensely and would recommend it to any Queen fan!!"
2,Music Insiders who Love Queen Talk About Queen,"This is one of the nerdiest music critique DVD's ever. If you want to see and listen to a group of unabashed Queen lovers talk about the early Queen albums/songs, this DVD is for you. If you want to see early concert footage, look elsewhere. The concert footage of portions of ""Keep Yourself Alive"" and ""Stone Cold Crazy"" is the best 5 minutes of the DVD. Other footage is mostly dubbed over with the studio recording, and all footage is constantly interupted by the bantering Queen lovers. The guitar guy is pretty interesting, but overall I would say get together with your old Queen listening buddies and reminisce, it's cheaper."
5,bigger than Absolute Editions!,"The book is actually WIDER than the Absolute editions that they release! Even more - the art was drawn to be expansive and there are larger scenes...in other words, it's the most beautiful graphic novel ever made (in my opinion)You'll love this. Just get it."
4,Beautiful!!!,"Simply put, this is beautiful. Alex Ross, who's now a legend, shows why as he paints every single imaginable detail in such realistic incredibility. Its amazing. Somehow he creates an iconic look for each of these icons without making them look alike. Obviously the selling point of this collection is the artwork by Ross but Paul Dini does a good job with each story focusing on a certain aspect of the hero. While none of the plotlines are earth shattering or matter to the continuity of each hero they are still good. One small complaint was while mostly the book is done without text boxes the text can sometimes be hard to read or even see without them. I understand that the editors wanted as much of the art as possible to be seen but it's a hindrance at times. Overall this is a really good book that you could stare at for hours."
3,Good old fashioned Old School,"Old school metal.Seemless riffing,hard hitting beats and a sense of humor.""Life of Crime"" ranks as one of the mosh pit's best kept secrets.Unfortunately, Zoetrope (pronounced ""ee-trope"") were overshadowed by Metallica, Anthrax, and Slayer in the late 80's.""NASA"" covers the Challenger incident, and points to the folly of technology.""Unbridaled Energy"" is a definate for the category of ""most underated mosh pit song""-Lemmy-esque vocals with searing guitar changes make you want to thrash till your nose bleeds.""Detention"" should bring back memories of high school to any on who ran afoul in school.If you're into classic speed metal,you could do a lot worse than ""Life Of Crime"" Folows Suicidal Tendencies ""Lights,Camera,Revolution"" wonderfully in my car."
3,Not the Whole Story,"Coleman's telling of the Carpenters' story is well researched and provides a great chronological history of their meteoric rise to become the best-selling American act of the 1970's. Written with the blessing of Richard Carpenter (who also maintained editorial control of what would be revealed), this book skirted around the personal demons which haunted the duo. I came away from reading it with more questions than answers as to why this beautiful young woman, who possessed one of the greatest female voices of all time, developed such a deep self-loathing which culminated in her death at age 32. Most of those questions remained until the release of Randy Schmidt's fine biography of Karen, written without the input of Richard Carpenter(he declined to be interviewed). Still, Ray Coleman gives a good accounting of the genius of Richard, who provided the musical framework for the perfection that was(and is) the magnificent voice of Karen Carpenter."
5,"Best for kittens, just as good for cats!","Although they're called kittens, I don't believe they will ever grow out of their curiosity! I picked up this book one day before getting my 1 year old tabby, Luke, and it's been an eye opener. Before I thought it was eat, poop, sleep, play. Now, after reading this, I am more aware of the potential dangers in my own home, and outside. There are plenty of diseases out there that I never really knew about (i.e., FIV (feline HIV), Luekemia, etc.). It gives much information in a very straight forward fashion that's quick and simple to understand. For first time cat owners, or even for people who might already have cats and think they know it all, you might not. So pick this one up, it's inexpensive, yet priceless!"
4,good product!,Its a good filter i will recommend this for anyone.fast shipment and good price.mercedes benz 2000 clk 320.Thanks
4,Mann Fuel Filter,"This went on my 2003 C320. It comes as described and fits just like the OEM. While I've seen others that were made in Israel, mine read ""Made in Germany"" so I have no worries about its durability. It's been working great since I installed it."
2,Pull-A-Part toy,"I have 2 Australian Shepherds who love toys so I try everything. This toy was quite small, smaller than I expected but it was ok. The squeakers did not last past day one and the entire toy lived about a week before seems were ripped and stuffing was out. Overall, this toy was expensive for its lifespan. If you have less aggressive players then this toy could last longer for your dog, but if you have enthusiastic pullers and chewers, this toy is not for you."
3,Great for the beginner.,"I liked the breakdown of this book with each prophet getting his own chapter. Each Chapter contains a brief history and setting as well as information about authorship, date and so on. There are also ""Think about"" and ""Digging Deeper"" segments in the book which focuses on certain themes individually thus allowing the reader to go deeper with his or her study instead of just reading the facts. The great advantage of this book is the further reading bibliography found at the back of each chapter which provides the reader with the opportunity to take his or her study of a specific prophet to a greater degree if he or she wishes."
3,Sunny,"I've loved ""Sunny"" since seeing it at the Goodspeed Opera House in Haddam, Ct in the '70s. Just wish there was a cast album of that production. However, this album originally recorded in the '20s makes up in vintage charm what it lacks in recording quality. The album includes several versions of ""Sunny."" The first gives the lead-ins to the songs so you see how they fit into the plot. The following ones give different versions of the songs and several songs that were added in subsequent productions. Several songs, ""D'ye love me?"" ""Who"" and ""Sunny"" are particularly delightful and will keep you humming. A must for lovers of the old Broadway musicals."
4,2 Year old loves it!!,My two year old love that he can use his fingers to make Elmo clap! Our four year old likes the book too!
5,Elmo Fan,"My 1.5 yo daughter wasn't that big of an elmo fan, but now she is. She loves this book. We follow the book and somtimes just use it as a puppet."
3,Elmo's head gets stuck in the board,"I saw this at Toys R Us but ordered it on Amazon. The product that arrived is hard to turn pages -- Elmo's head is too ""high"" and hits the borders of each page. If I were you I'd just buy it in person to avoid this problem."
4,Toddler likes Elmo? Get this book!,"You can use the Elmo puppet as you read this book to your kids. It's only about 3-4 pages long, but your kids will get a kick out of following along to the revised lyrics of ""If you're happy and you know it"" that Elmo says in this puppet book.My daughter is no longer amused by this book, so it might not amuse your kids for that long, but this book is well constructed and it's great as long as your kid is a fan of Sesame Street and Elmo."
2,not a very resourceful book,"Before getting my pets, I have looked up information on the internet and got a pretty good understanding, but I wanted a book as a handy reference. This book was rather disappointing because it doesnot offer much more than the internet: too much unimportant information (mickey mouse!), and not enough about mouse behavior, how to handle different medical problems such as taking care of pregnant mouse and her pups etc. I do not recommend this book."
3,good beginner book,"This book is nice to have around as a first time mouse owner just in case, but it really didn't tell me much I hadn't already learned on the internet and I honestly have hardly opened it. Would probably be good for a child getting their first mouse..."
1,Racist Crap,"I picked up this book hoping to have a better understanding of the Irish past, and all I got was a racist slant on an otherwise abused people. It is sad that even in the modern day the Irish must still deal with racist garbage like this. Mr. Ignatiev should try reading more on the Irish before writing a book of half-truths and presumptions."
1,"Noel Ignatiev, a racist?","The most ironic thing about this book is that the author creates his own racial construct - the Irish, so he can prove that they are respsonsible for all the racial ills of today. The book would be comical if the author wasn't so serious."
1,Get a clue.,"Taking Ignatiev seriously will only anger you. Here is another Harvard professor trying to cause controversy and media for himself. Mr. Ignatiev attacks the Irish and blames them for the ills of the black man and pretty much calls them cowards for turning what he calls ""White"", His use of arcane 18th century material fails to grasp the Irish in there true immigrant form; for that we need to study the 1840's and the Irish genocide. Save your money and do not line the pockets of an Irish Hater.ERIN GO BRAGH!!!"
1,more hatemongering lunacy,"I don't think their is much to add to my title, other than this is just more lunacy from the same hatemonger who wrote ""race traitor"""
1,What next?,Blame a victim anyone? I will say nothing about the author's motives. Perhaps this one will be posted. Posted on 5-12-07.
1,neither racist nor about the irish becoming white,"While he choses an eye-catching title, his book is actually a history of the Irish in Philadelphia. This history conveniently touches on issues of ethnicity on occasion, but it's clearly not his original subject. (Though I bet he chose this title to make more money, which he probably is, given the hysterics being written in reviews here).If you're really looking for a book on this topic, I would recommend reading his afterward and trying a few of the books listed there."
4,A well documented and highly interesting book,"I found this book very interesting and well documented from period sources. The author describes the little known and rarely acknowledged attitudes and actions of one immigrant ethnic group, and how this group established a place in America at the expense of other groups. The effects are still being felt today."
2,"Good reference, but Prof. Ignatiev overreaches","This book is useful as a catlogue of many important and interesting events, and students will find it a handy reference tool. However, Prof. Ignatiev would have us believe that the Irish, in their natural state, were pure and untainted by bigotry, but that contact with America somehow caused them to become racist. This is untenable at best. He could have argued his thesis more effectively in a shorter essay. Short on analysis, the book is merely an interesting laundry list of riots and other events, and his many anecdotes do not do much to advance his argument. Nonetheless, the work is an interesting read and should prove useful to students."
3,Dark Side of Irish America,"Ignatiev's brief work documents a rough and unpleasant aspect of urban Irish America in the nineteenth century, its racism. It shouldn't be too surprising to any student of Irish history that an essentially conservative Irish peasantry, transplanted to America, maintained a cultural, rather than class-based, solidarity. Paradoxically, for many, this meant adopting the same racist attitudes towards African-Americans as their own nativist tormentors. Ignatiev's study is sober and well-researched. For those who can get around the enthusiastic back cover endorsement by Mumia Abu-Jamal, and the occasional obtuse side arguments with other socialist scholars, this is a valuable contribution to the history of race relations and the Irish diaspora."
4,Very Informative,"Comprehensive Qigong dvd. 15 min sitting qigong i feel is best for cool downs or when injured. 18 min standing qigong is good for warm-up or cool down or a waking up exercise. The explanation is complete and informative. The music during the exercise segments is very relaxing. Overall the production quality is high, but in the sitting segment there is a period of amaturish camara shake. Yang's english pronunciation is clear and subtitles are provided. Presented in lecture, demonstration,practice form. The practice sesions are with music soundtrack only, a cue soundtrack would be helpful."
4,Eight Simple Qigong Exercises For Health - The Eight (8) Pieces of Brocade (YMAA) DVD,"I've been doing Qiqonq for many years and have tried a number of books, DVD's and tapes. This one incorporates the key elements in a very easy to understand and follow program. I would recommend reading other books that go into more depth about the principles of Qiqonq than the book that comes with this DVD."
4,This is good stuff.,"This is a nice compliment for practicing martial artists who have the extra time to devote to these exercizes. The video does a very good job of comprehensively explaining and demonstrating each ""piece"" for both sitting and standing. It is particularly interesting to learn about the 1,000+ year history of this healing art and know that the techniques have effectively endured for centuries. A very good addition to your library."
5,Pleasant and excellent DVD,"I found this DVD to be both pleasant to watch and use, and excellent in its format. I thought the instruction was very useful and easy to understand and Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming gave me insight that stuck with me and went deeply to the core of my understanding. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in even the basics of Qigong."
3,Poor Quality,"The quality of the disc was very poor. It would not play in my dvd player, and played very intermittently on my computer causing a loud humming noise. The disc was obviously mis-shapen in some way. On the few snippets I was able to see, Dr. Jwing-Ming seemed to spend an inordinate amount of time advertising his other products; the reason I returned for refund rather than exchange. English subtitles are used (even though his English is acceptable) and sometimes obscure his movements. I bought this product for it's 5-star rating despite it's relatively high price. When the refund comes through I will choose a different dvd."
2,after the 2nd time... very very slow,The first time you see this you need explanation and appreciate the slowness set for someone seeing the exercise for the first time. The second and third time you wish there was a mode for flowing through the exercise instead of again listening to the explanations like a cassette player that is running down on batteries.
1,poor format,"Though it is apparent that Dr. Yang is a good teacher, the format of this video is very poor. You are shown once how to do a ""piece"" and then you are expected to pause the video and do this piece by yourself 20 or so times. If you don't pause the video, Dr. Yang immediately moves onto the next ""piece"" to which you are suppose to memorize, pause the video and then do that one 20 or so times by memory by yourself, and so on. Ridiculous!"
5,Zenergy Chimes,"Thanks for the speedy transaction. I am already using the chimes. Thanks, cherylgraves"
5,Super Fantastic,"As a Public Speaking expert and author I love this! If you need a better way to get everyone back in the room at the end of a break. Rather than yelling ""Everyone come back in the room now"" or Your break is over"" use something that grabs their attention like this. I just purchased one and it is awesome! Amazon has it for a great price too"
4,Meditate and concentrate,"The precision tuned chimes provide a pleasant concentration point. This well-made chime is a nice conversation piece, as well as a musical instrument (limited) and a meditation chime. Sounds great together or individually. Strike one, two or all bars to provide a pleasant tone to focus on."
5,Zenergy3 Chime,This chime is used in my classroom to draw the children back to order after group work. The sound is more pleasant than a buzzer on a timer. I was in awe the first time I used it to see the students' pleasant expressions when they heard it. Now they want to be the ones to strike the chime. Another teacher was so envious of the chimes that I purchased one for her too.
5,Soothing sound,"WOW, What a difference in my students when I use this product to get their attention, they actually smile when they hear the sound. It is a very soothing and calming way to focus the class. I saw this product on other educational websites for a lot more. This is a great buy."
5,Beautiful sound for home or classroom,"I use this in my classroom and the children LOVE it! It's not jarring like a regular transition signal such as saying ""give me 5"" a buzzer, clapping, bell etc... I noticed students with autism really like the sound of this. I tell students that they should be quiet by the time it stops chiming which works really well because you have to listen carefully as the sound ends much like a singing bowl, but with multiple sounds. You can also just strike one note. Awesome!"
4,Ethernet mount box,"It has the expected features the advertise showed. The quality looks good enough for home utilization, and it is compact enough for practically to blend with the walls I planned to install them.With the product, there was a little guide with the wires schema to make the installation smoothly.I would recommend this device to anybody who needs to install Ethernet connectivity."
3,"Life like dog, but quality was a let down","This dog seems to really be breathing and comes with it's own little doggie bed and cardboard pet carrier...cute. Problem: the battery panel doesn't stay in place, the dogs collar is barely glued on so the collar just fell off after the first day. Our 8 yr. old did love the dog though because she wants a real one and this was kinda close. It just lays in it's bed and sleeps all the time. There's no OFF switch so batteries may go quickly!"
1,ripoff,this company sent me this already been opened and used returned toy.battery inside seeping acid and I dont think they even come with the batterys.once again dumping damaged inventory on unsuspecting customers.hopeing they dont have time to return it like me. Right in to the trash. thank you amozon.com for protecting your valuable customers.
3,It works,"After one month of using, the hooks broke, so I am not super impressed. I like its color and length, though the material is not strong and steady enough."
5,Local Portland Rag Review (WW has no music rating system),"FELLERFlanked all around with touchy-feely acoustic rock, the 11 songs on Furthermore make high marks in ardor, rootsiness and strong vocal delivery. When the quartet kicks into rock gear, the result is not too far from the land of the Dave Matthews Band. The rock-and-roll aesthetic is nice, but even nicer is when the pace and percussion slow down and let the acoustic guitar shine through, as on ""Heavy Gone."" -Willamette Week (AI )"
1,Incorrect Movie,This was the most incorrect biography I have ever seen. It is written by a historical fictionist and is totally trying to bring Washington down. This movie was obviously an opinion. How could the author say those things about Washington. I highly recommend you don't watch it. It should not be used for children. You'll be teaching your kids incorrect things.
4,Liquid Calcium,"I bought these a little over a month ago along with some Liquid Magnesium.IMO, Carlson is one of the better vitamin vendors. Only one minor issue withthese vitamins and the Magnesium - large pills. Lots of liquid washes themdown most of the time. Other than this, I have no complaints."
2,"Big, Clumsy, keeps falling","Got nice detalining on the head/heat, the quality of the fabric/body is questionable (not very pleasing) and its hand keeps popping out on its own, as the cane is too heavy for it. Don't recommend it, too bad, though :/"
4,Classic Patrick Adams disco with FONDA RAE on lead vocals!,"If you love disco/R&B from the 80s, then you'll love this reissue CD of the obscure disco diva act RAINBOW BROWN, produced by disco king PATRIC ADAMS (Musique, Shades of Love, many more) with searing, lush lead vocals by FONDA RAE, the lung-busting voice behind countless acts like WISH (Touch Me) and many other - featuring a bonus TOM MOULTON extended mix, this is a nice package for the disco lover in us all. Overlooked, but still a nice addition to your collection."
2,Simplified 12-Step Program,"We used this in my recovery group and I found it more than useless to anyone who can read at a high school level or above. It's a very simplified version of the 12-step programs repackaged. Now, for adults who aren't all that literate, it may be a good book. There are a ton of examples to help explain the concepts (obviously not true examples, but written specifically for the book) and silly pictures more suited for kids, but they at least break up the blocks of reading into manageable chunks.Otherwise, it's a pass. I learned more from the bookRecovery Options: The Complete Guidethan I did during my two months in group, and its just a description of all treatment options (without being ANY treatment program). Now that's just sad."
3,Not so sure about this one,"Might have to read it again. Was very much interested in this book and at the end the feeling I got was, Is this all? It has very good parts, things pointed out that make sense but it goes so deep into what sexual behavoir means and could have meant then that one gets a bit lost, it doesnt get to the point regarding Vita and Virginia in that it explains in a very intelectual (and a bit boring)way what was going on then...To one who has read virginia and vita (books, essays, letters (to each other and to others)it doesnt show anything new, no new insights into her relationship...The book centers on Vita much more than on Virginia and not enough on their relationship... but now that I write about it I feel that I might need to read it again...It is not bad (not at all) but It was not what I expected it."
4,extra toe room EXC but maybe half size smaller,"First of all, where do you get off, Amazon, inserting ""frustrated this time"" into my review? AI-overdone!!I'm an older, heavy, sedentary guy with always picky feet and now diabetes.Most of my life I've been a 9eee or when I could get it, eeeE. My last 9eeee were Nike Monarchs - excellent cushioning!! But they seemed a bit short. Got these in 9.5 eeee and they are the Most comfortable shoes ever to just have on. Except for walking. Unless I'm wearing the thickest of socks my feet tend to slide around inside a bit. Obviously I'd be better off with a 9, not a 9.5 - just a thought for anyone thinking of upsizing a notch. The toe room translates to a LOT of extra space.If only I could have the Monarch's cushioning with the SL-2 Last of these 881s, I'd be in shoe heaven."
5,Great Mardi Gras Music,"The songs are fun, upbeat and appropriate for a company function.Good quality, and a nice variety.No complaints. Thanks."
5,LOVE!!,SO glad I bought this spinner. Beats the ones in the store ANYDAY! Don't waste your money at Wal-Mart.....theirs is JUNK! The bowl is nice and thick so you won't have to worry about it flexing. Basket is thick and tough so I don't see it breaking anytime in the near or far future. Lid is nice and snug as well so it will keep your salad fresher longer.
1,Broke at 2 months,"Eh. I guess most people have good experiences with this, and it's the top-rated on Amazon. Good price. SO I'll probably buy another, from whatever store has the best return policy. It worked fine until it broke at 2 months. Too bad."
5,a necessary kitchen tool,"I grew up in a household in which no one had even heard of a salad spinner let alone used one. I have worked for several years in the restaurant industry and I find having a salad spinner indispensable. I use one every day. For those of you who are not used to using one, they can only be compared to beating your clothes against a rock rather than washing them in a machine. You get your greens much cleaner and they are nice and dry when you finish so the dressing doesn't slide off. I use the outer bowl to soak the greens in and then I dump them in the strainer part and spin away. Easy. The pump model is great because you can use it with only one hand (feel free to use your other hand for any purpose you like) and the OXO construction, as usual, is solid. You will wonder what you did before you owned this."
1,spun out after only a month,"I had been happily using a very inexpensive salad spinner purchased at IKEA for about ten years. It finally gave out when the plastic part on the inside began to break. I was ready to replace it and thought I might even get something that would be easier to use. I read the reviews for the OXO spinner and thought it sounded great. However, when I got it, it did not spin as well as my old one from the very beginning and by the end of the first month was spinning so slowly that the letttuce was still very damp, even after very vigourous pumping up and down of the handle. I am very disappointed with this product."
5,Great Salad Spinner,This product is not only easy to use with the good grip handle it's also mess free. All you do is press a few times and the spinner does the work. The handle also locks down for storage. I don't recommend that you put this in the dishwasher though because the bowl will warp. But it's so easy to clean you don't need to run it through in the dishwasher. Highly recommended.
1,Piece of Junk,This thing is a piece of junk. When you try to spin it fast enough to get the water off it jams up. Dont waste your $$$
1,worked well until it exploded,"I bought this item and used it for about 2 months, then It exploded while I was spinning a salad and was impossible to repair. I went on to buy a Tupperware salad spinner (green) and have been using it for four years with no problems at all."
5,Works great,"I really like this spinner. It is larger than I was expecting -- perfect size for a salad for two people. It is easy to use. In addition to drying greens, I have used it to spin excess juice out of salted summer squash and cabbage."
2,Breaks too easily,I've had two of these expensive salad spinners. Both broke (the mechanism became inoperable) within a year of using them. I am currently searching for a more durable spinner.
5,Mighty Mini,"Love this spinner. I had purchased the original OXO salad spinner a few years ago. Due to limited space, I made the mistake of giving the spinner away and buying a series ( I do mean series) of smaller spinners. I have never been happy with the quality of these spinners, but now I have come home. This is a perfect salad spinner for two adults, depending on the type of salad its big enough for four.This is compact, light and sturdy! I would highly recommend."
2,NOT DISHWASHER SAFE,"This worked great the single time we used it. Then we washed it in the dishwasher (top shelf only, as per instructions), and the plastic warped so that now the lid doesn't fit, making the spinner totally useless. Wish I'd bought the stainless steel one or something from another manufacturer."
3,Very easy to use ... but vegetables still wet after 5 minutes,It's extremely easy to use. In fact my 5 year old did a wonderful job spinning it for 5 minutes. Wish it was more effective. I'm exchange it for a larger size.
3,Broke in less than 2 months!,"This salad spinner worked fantastically right up until it inexplicably broke. The spinning mechanism that ran between the handle and the lid just snapped in half, mid-spin. :("
2,Not Dishwasher-safe,"My inner basket to the spinner warped after one cycle through the dishwasher. Before critical reviewers try to flame me for improperly washing the unit, it's advertised as dishwasher safe on the top rack. I routinely wash many other plastic items in my dishwasher, and this is the only problem I've ever had with any item I've washed. I have several other OXO products, and I never would have expected OXO to cut corners with their materials."
2,Not enough force to remove water properly,"I've been using a manual (hand crank) spinner for some years and the force builds up like a spin cycle in a washing machine - when you take off the cover, the lettuce, or spinach, or whatever you're cleaning, is completely dry and ready to work with. I wanted to try the ""push button"" version, however, when I opened it up and looked it over, I wondered immediately how enough force was going to build up to actually spin off all the water, since that is no longer in your control and is up to the ""button."" I tried it with spinach and romaine, and unfortunately, the leaves were still water-droplet covered. A good spinner will leave the leaves almost entirely dry, and gorgeously ready to use. Am sending back immediately and going to try a different one. Why o why did I leave the one I loved w/ the ex?"
5,OXO Salad Spinner,"I purchased this Spinner a few years ago and use it maybe once every few weeks. It works great for its intendend purpose - salads and veggies, but I also like to use it for pasta. If you're going to make a pasta salad and want to strain out all the water before you mix it all up with your ingredients, this works great. Like many others, I am one who likes to read the 1-star reviews 1st before deciding to purchase anything and after reading them for this, all I have to say is - I haven't tried any other salad spinners to compare this to, but maybe it is possible that the 1-star reviewers just got 'lemons' or could be that maybe this isn't good for every-single-day use? Who knows, all I know is I am giving this 5-stars because I give mine what I would think is 'normal' use and it works wonderfully!"
3,Good Size Salad Spinner; Okay at Actually Spinning,"This salad spinner is a great size for small families. I most frequently use it to prepare my salads for lunch. The only thing I don't really like is that sometimes it does not spin very easily. It takes a moment to get it going and sometimes it gets stuck even if the bowl is not too full. Once it is going though, it works as well as any other salad spinner."
5,well worth the money,"I have wanted this salad spinner for a long time, especially after seeing it on Good Eats. I finally decided to get it since there was a bonus item and other discount, and I couldn't be more thrilled. It is so much better than my cheapie salad spinner. It is very easy to use; the plastic is nice and heavy; and the rubber ring under the bowl keeps it from sliding around. It will definitely get a lot of use in my house."
4,salad spinner easy to use,This salad spinner is one of the easiest to use. It holds a lot and really spin dries not only lettuce but pastas as well.
5,a MUST for any kitchen,So much easier to rinse veggies and fruits. The pump spinning mechanism is super easy to use and very efficient.
4,Nice salad spinner,This spinner works pretty well. Still does not dry lettuce completely and have to dry with flour sack towel. I grow my own lettuce so it must be washed thoroughly. This helps speed up the drying process. Nice bowl that you can serve the lettuce in if you wish. Works great to store lettuce in fridge.
3,Great at what it does... but....,"Salad spinners have now been with us for 30 or more years, and if you're going to buy one, the Oxo, like almost all Oxo kitchen tools, is among the best. But for the cost of an Oxo I can buy a crate of kitchen towels, and it doesn't take any more time to lay lettuce on a towel than it does to get out the spinner, rinse it, spin the lettuce, dry the spinner and put it away. Buy a dozen towels and just toss each one in the laundry after use."
3,Should Spin Faster,After reading all the great reviews I purchased this spinner. I grow letture in the spring and use spinner frequently. It works well but does not dry as well as the spinner it replaced (I think my previous one was a Moulinex purchased about 20 years ago). The previous spinner had a handle and gears that spun the bowl faster so that more moisture was removed. My wife gave away the old spinner and I would trade the new Oxo for it if I could. Given the old one is not available the Oxo is the best choice.
1,Used 3 months than it cracked!,"I bought this because it was a small size for storage. First it doesn't spin out real well because of design. Second after about 8 uses the top cracked! I never put it into the dishwasher. Would I buy it again? NO. Can I return it? NO, I have owned it for 3 months."
1,Worked great for a while,We loved the salad spinner when we got it. This is about 4 years later. It started to fall apart after the 1st year. 1st was the little plastic brake. Next the inner assembly. We've been limping along with it now for a couple years. Everyone we've spoken with who has the spinner salad say they don't fall apart. We're going to try that next.
4,The Product Name is Misleading,"So I thought some exercise would be involved in using the Salad Spinner. I suppose I was thinking of the menu of aerobic exercises available at the gym - stepping, spinning, etc. I was OK with having to expend some calories -- I prefer brownies to salad, so my desire to chow down on leafy greens is a good indicator that I NEED the excercise. OXO, however, has disappointed me. Not one bit of effort is needed to produce clean, reasonably dry lettuce, cabbage, spinach and other yucky stuff. You press the pump and it spins away. Sure you can practice a few Tae Bo moves while it does its thing, but if I were one to spend idle time by making superflous movements, I wouldn't have to eat salad in the first place!"
2,Stupid design,Mine broke. And it's unclear how it's even supposed to work in the first place. Hated this thing almost from the moment I got it.
1,Not for use in enriching Yellow Cake,"I bought this centrifuge to use in enriching Yellow Cake (seeDH Classic Yellow Cake 12ct) in my WMD program. But despite its great reviews here on Amazon, the OXO Salad Spinner is terrible. The mesh grating isn't fine enough to properly sift and concentrate plutonium out of theDH Classic Yellow Cake 12ct.Plus, it broke! I can't believe it. All my other OXO lab equipment is top-notch with easy-grip handles. I love them! I feel so betrayed by OXO.Still, at least I got a free vacation to Cuba out of it. Homeland Security says I'll get a free trip from ""Gitmo"". Is that the new resort I heard about? So excited!"
1,great toy for toddlers,"my 18 month old son loooooves this salad spinner. he puts his playmobile guys in it and wheeeee, there they go. unfortunately, there's no cussing way it's going to dry your lettuce, but seriously, you have dish towels, right? back to basics folks."
2,"Great at first, then dies a clunky death","We got this as a wedding gift and it was wonderful. However the plunger spring soon failed. You could push the plunger down, but it would never pop back up. You could sort of dig it out with a butter knife, but then that sort of defeats the purpose of its design. I think OXO makes one that uses a pulled chain to spin the contents, and while that may be a bit more tedious (rolling it back up like a yo-yo), it won't get stuck the way this one did."
3,expected less water drops,"The item has a good presentation and works fine in it's mechanical dimension, but I expected to get less water over each leaf of lettuce. After 10 minutes of spinning the vegetables have a cover of tiny water drops that I wish this device could take out."
3,Liked older version better,I have an older version with the white lid which doesny come apart. I spin my salad and leave it in the old container. The new container doesn't seem to seal as well and after a day the lettuce wilts a little. It just isn't as good as the older model.
5,I'm Back Again to Buy Another,"Well ...after wondering how it worked, my wife and I like it so much, find it so easy to use that we are buying our second Oxo salad spinner for another place. We have had the first one for about four weeks. The price and the simplicity of use couldn't be better..."
4,Great Salad Spinner,"The OXO Good Grips Salad Spinner is a winner. It works great and is easy to clean because of a well made design. If you never used a salad spinner before, you will never know how you lived without it after you use it. The only reason this was not rated 5 stars is because I have to sit there after I pump the salad spinner and hold the top to keep ot stable or it will go off the counter. This is a minor inconvenience that I think could be resolved by OXO on their next design."
2,warped second time in dishwasher,"We have used our salad spinner twice and were impressed with how easy it was to use. The salad is not completely dry but most water is removed and much better than towel drying or a puddle of water at the bottom or your bowl. But the second time we washed the unit in the dishwasher (top shelf) one piece is visably warped and no longer aligns properly. Now the basket only spins a few times before stopping on its own if you tightly close the lid. Now we need to return and decide if we want to get another knowing that we can not put in the dishwasher or just return and consider something else. The salad spinner components take up the entire top shelf of the dishwasher, so we probably would have hand washed most times anyway. But it is annoying that they state it is dishwasher safe then a piece warps after a couple of washes. And after searching through the reviews I see that others have run into similar problems."
2,Great until it broke,"I've had my Oxo for about 3 years now. I wouldn't say I used it often, but when I did it worked just fine. I went to use it tonight and it broke. The inside top was all rusted and one of the screws snapped. The spring was also rusted. It's never been in the dishwasher and always air dried. I am going to contact Oxo to see what they have to say."
1,A good product too cheaply made,"I have purchased at least a dozen of these salad spinners over the years. Some last for months, others, like the one I purchased a few weeks ago, break almost immediately. They are not well-made and the quality of the plastic seems to vary greatly. I keep buying them because there are no comparable models on the market that I am aware of. They need to make a heavy-duty model for people like me who use it nearly every day."
4,Another hit from OXO,I really dig this spinner. It is a little bit small but I don't think they make any that are much bigger. The only real problem is that there should be a better way to catch more water than it does. You have to empty the water out once and then spin it again to really get the lettuce where you want it. But overall this is probably the best salad spinner you can buy.
5,Great Product,I had thought that a a salad spinner was a waste of cabinet space. My husband planted huge amounts of lettuces this year and we thought perhaps a spinner would help keep some of the produce longer. This one is perfect. It truly is surprising at how quickly and simply it takes care of the job. I have even used it to dry string beans that were blanched and ready to freeze. A friend was over recently and she has a different spinner that she says is a complete failure after looking at the OXO.
1,cheap piece of crap,I used this about 6 times and the lid broke! A salad spinner has to be sturdy - this one is not!
2,breaks too easily,This is a great spinner EXCEPT for the fact that it is cheaply made. It broke the first 2 weeks we had it - the top broke off of the spinner mechanism. So I duct taped it back together (love the duct tape). Now 4 months later it has broken again except not fixable this time - something inside the spinner mechanism itself. So while the concept is good - I think I'll stay away from OXO next time.
4,Good Spinner,"I've had this salad spinner for a year or two now. I first bought it when I joined a CSA and was getting a tons of fresh greens but they needed a lot of cleaning. Once I rinse greens and spin them I usually just put the entire salad spinner in the frig and it keeps the greens fresh for some time and they are always ready to eat that way. It is bulky though and takes up a lot of room whether it is inside or outside of the frig, but if it were smaller it wouldn't do the job either.It does a good job at what it does, no complaints."
3,"Great design, so, so manufacture","We are big on salads. This model got a good workout and after 12 months the bowl cracked. Glued the bowl and the lid mechanism gave out shortly thereafter. Upgraded to the steel bowl model--thought it might be sturdier than plastic, and it is. The spinner mechanism failed after less than a week and I returned the lid to OXO. They sent me a whole new unit, so now I've got two sturdy steel bowls! Unfortunately, the spinner has now failed again, but after almost two years of fairly heavy use. We'll gladly get another because the thing really does its job beautifully. Now, if only the spinner would match up with the bowls.............. The bowls do make excellent mixing bowls."
4,Good Job On Salads,"We eat a salad nearly every day and like the convenience of the bagged salads. However, with the concern over contaminates in produce such as salads we had begun washing the greens...something we had not done previously. It has been difficult to remove all the water and the result has been a somewhat watered down salad when the dressing is added. This salad spinner does a good job of removing the excess water."
5,What did I do without it,"I love it. I use it for all the greens we get in our ""greens share."" Herbs, lettuce. Easy to use. Good for storage. Very easy to clean."
4,Confusing Directions,"This is a great product. However, according to the directions, the basket should be filled with ""rinsed"" salad greens. What I would like to know is why one wouldn't fill the basket with unrinsed greens, then rinse it in the basket under the faucet, and then put in the bowl to be spun dry."
2,Not my favorite spinner,"I bought this spinner to replace an older salad spinner that had a handle attached to a string that is pulled out to set the top spinning, the string could be pulled repeatedly to get the spinner going really fast. I found that with this OXO salad spinner I could not get the speed going as high, even when repeatedly pressing the top plunger. I was rarely able to get as much water removed from my greens as I was used to with the older spinner.I recently replaced my OXO spinner with a Zyliss salad spinner which is of the style with the handle attached to a string which starts the spinning. It spins faster and gets my greens as dry as I wish. I am much happier with it."
5,Does its job well,"This gem works as advertised. Push the button and you've got dry salad. I like how easy it is to push the button and I like how you can lock the button down, making the spinner double as a bowl. You can even be creative and use it as a collander."
1,Does not dry lettuce well enough! Would NOT recommend.,"I dropped my old Zyliss salad spinner (with a pull string) on a tile floor and broke the bowl. I could not find another one like it anywhere, so I purchased this Oxo version after reading mostly positive reviews. It's awful! After pumping on the top of it until I am exhausted, the lettuce is still too wet and if I put it away like that, it rots within a couple of days. I need to take the leaves out and put them on paper towels to finish drying. I plan to dump the Oxo as soon as I can get the Miu pull string one that I see on this site--once it's back in stock. Maybe that will be an improvement, and closer to the Zyliss that I miss so much."
1,Almost DOA,"Purchased this on June 12, 2012, delivered on June 18, 2012. Wife used it once and then the gearing in the lid failed during the second use. Called OXO about this and spoke to a Martha in customer service. She offered to send out a free replacement lid. I'm happy.Several weeks later, no lid, so I call OXO again and speak to Barb. Barb advises that the lid in question is back ordered till September 2012 (today is July 18, 2012), but they will FedEx once it arrives.Happy wife, happy life. Product did not impress and the customer service was as bad or worse. Will I ever see the new lid? Will Martha admit she lied? Do I care?Should you buy this? Wife said it didn't even do a good job drying the one lettuce head she was able to use before the item died.Caveat emptor."
4,OXO salad spinner,I recently received my salad spinner and can't believe I have lived this long without it!I love the fact that I can store the salad in the bowl in the fridge and have had a salad ready for eating in the fridge continuouslysince I bought it. I find myself eating more salad since it is already ready to go whenever I am looking to snack.
2,Can't get my greens dry!,"I bought this spinner because of the great reviews but I'm having a big problem in that I can't seem to get my lettuce dry. No matter how many times I've spun it there still seems to be a fair amount of visible water. Based on the reviews I expected to get ""crisp, dry"" lettuce. My lettuce is crisp but not dry and I'm afraid that if I put it into the fridge as is it will get bad fast.So what am I doing wrong? I've tried adding a couple (or more) paper towels - that didn't help. I've tried putting less lettuce, that didnt help either. btw I'm talking about a large salad for one person. I've also tried draining it on my drainer.If anyone knows what I should or shouldnt be doing please let me know; else I'm going to have to return it :-(Bernard"
2,OK at best,"Oxo Good Grips Salad SpinnerThe problem with this Oxo spinner is that it doeesn't spin fast enough, failing to remove enough water from lettuce leaves. Also, it's so light-weight that it needs to be held down to keep from bouncing around. For years I had excellent results with a Zyliss spinner with a pull-cord, but it finally gave out, and I can't seem to find that model any more."
4,So-So Salad Spinner,"I bought this while on a health kick, thinking it would make me eat more salad, and because I needed a crisper. I use it occasionally, but I found cleaning it to be difficult. It fits awkwardly in the dishwasher, and I find the spinner top very difficult to wash by hand (since I've moved to an apartment that no longer has a dishwasher). I would recommend the smaller version, unless you have an extra large family. I also don't find it to be a very good crisper--my lettuce lasts two days... at most! Maybe I'm not locking the top, I don't know.I do have to say it has pros, it does an amazing job of spinning greens, and the ability to use the clear bowl for service is nice."
5,A Double Purpose Spinner,"I recently replaced my old spinner with the OXO Mini Salad and Herb Spinner and find it is not only a great looking kitchen helper but it also serves an unexpected double purpose. It is quite large enough for a medium salad for 2 people and the water seems to fly off, and when I take the spinner out, the outer bowl - after a quick rinse and drying - serves as a great bowl for the salad. The OXO people have supplied me with a bowl that looks like glass and I no longer need to find a Salad Bowl - my OXO Salad Spinner supplies it!"
1,poor performance,I was unable to get the salad spinner to spin with salad in the basket. It worked fine empty. I tossed it out and will start using pre-washed lettuce again.
4,Best thing but keep it away from the stove.,"Can't say enough good things about this spinner but I've ultimately had to ditch the plastic and go with the stainless steel model. Typically when I wash greens etc., I set the whole thing out to air dry on top of the stove. Unfortunately, I've run through my 3rd and final plastic spinner because someone invariably uses an adjacent burner w/o moving the spinner. The outer bowl melts and warps, preventing the inner basket from spinning. I've rescued them in the past by reheating the warped spot and restoring it to its normal shape, but I'm done with that now."
2,OXO OKO,"The spinner works well, but be sure you have enought room to store it. I haven't used a spinner before and found it to be large, clunky, and hard to store."
2,Probably only acceptable for salad,"I bought this device in the hope that I would be able to put it to use with more than just salad, to rationalize the somewhat inflated price. I assumed it would be effective in drying things other than leafy greens, and now my hamster is dead.I would like to have been able to review its ability to dry spinach or lettuce, but the spinner's failure in the hamster-drying test was such that the spinner is no longer fit for use with food (or much of anything else, I imagine).Also- and I am trying to phrase this delicately- the spinner is not very easy to clean. Again, though, this could be a usage-specific problem and may not reflect situations where it is used in a manner that more closely adheres to its intended use."
3,Worked well but not durable,"Used this for about 7 months. The bottom part wasn't as sturdy as we had hoped. It cracked and leaked water from the pressure of operating the spinner. Can't hold a good amount of water without bending out of shape and almost breaking. After about a year of moderate/occasional use, the spinning mechanism finally came to a grinding halt. I'm looking for a sturdier product now."
3,It's good but my old spinner was better,"I bought this based on all of the positive reviews but my old salad spinner was better. The biggest problem I have with the Oxo is that my lettuce doesn't get really dry. My old spinner worked with a string and I could spin the inner basket much faster which left the lettuce much drier. The push down mechanism of the Oxo does not create enough speed to dry the lettuce thoroughly, in my opinion. If you like your lettuce really dry, you're probably better off with another salad spinner."
1,Chinese junk,I bought three of these in the last three years. The first one I purchased lasted almost a year before the plastic bowl cracked. The second one lasted eight months before the bowl cracked. The third one was a stainless steel one but the plastic lid cracked after nine months of use. These salad spinners are nothing but Made in China trash.
5,"Late Bloomer...Glad I'm a part of the ""IN"" crowd!!!!","What can I say that has not already been said. I purchased the Mini because I have limited cabinet space and usually am cooking for 2 or less. This thing is amazing, works like a charm. I only wish that you could by additional strainers so I could use as temporary storage while I am spinning something else. I'm really glad I opted for the Mini and will likely buy a second one. The size is perfect and holds more than what you'd probably anticipate from the picture. Amazon offers a great priced compared to other retailers on this (unless you get a 30% coupon at Kohls)."
5,Awesome Product!!,"I love this item. I used to go through tons of paper towel and waste tons of time drying lettuce. I always thought a salad spinner was silly and would take up lots of space. I was very wrong. I don't need to use any paper towel whatsoever, it takes only a couple minutes to have dry lettuce, and I can store my remaining lettuce in the spinner in the fridge. I've used it a few times and I am really happy that I made this purchase."
4,"Works very well, too small.","This salad spinner works much better than our old one (a battery operated model), and is actually easier to use. The parts fit together well, and pushing the plunger is easier than holding down the button on the battery model. It's easy to clean, and keeps salad longer and crisper than our old one. The only complaint is that it holds less lettuce, even though it's roughly the same size as our old one. The spinner mechanism takes up a fair amount of room in the bowl, hence less room for lettuce. So I would prefer a larger size (I do like my salad in quantity) to make up for that. But all in all, a very well made spinner."
5,Great Spinner!!!!!!,"This salad spinner is the best. Really throws the water off lettuce leaves better than any other spinner, and so easy to use."
5,EXACTLY what I needed.,"I'm saving a ton of money on paper towels thanks to this thing. I put a large amount of lettuce in, push the spin thing a bunch of times, stop it, and taaadaaa, dry lettuce. As someone who eats a really big salad every day, this is absolutely perfect. Been using it for about 6 months with no problems at all."
4,Saving my hands,I bought this product to save my hands. I have very bad arthritis in my hands and the product that I was formerly useing caused a lot of pain in my hands - having to spin lettuce with a crank. This product does not require any turning with the hand. You simply press down on the top and it spins instantly without any pressure or hurt to the hands. It does a great job - fast. I love the difference this has made for me.
1,Broke after 1 months use,We had our old salad spinner for years. This one lasted for just a month before it started having problems. At first the tab that locks the pump flat kept getting stuck and then it stopped working altogether.
5,Love it and use it almost every day,"I have used the spinner almost daily for a couple of months. The OXO salad spinner is an excellent product. I have not had any problems at all. Some commented on the spinning mechanism breaking, but mine has worked flawlessly. I use it to clean homegrown mixed greens as well as purchased lettuce and greens. I also store all the greens in it and they keep for weeks, and are always crisp and fresh. Although it is a little bulkier than the dish I used to store the greens in it fits well in the refrigerator because the knob locks down and can slide under the shelf. And unlike the other containers, even the ones the greens from the store come in, I have never had to throw out any of my produce since I started using the OXO spinner. No more slimy stuff in a bowl, ever! Hoping it will last for years to come. I would highly recommend this product especially if you are paying $4-$5 for a little box of greens."
3,This is a good spinner,but I think it is overpriced. The construction and quality is notmuch different from other cheaper spinners. Probably would opt for something less expensive or check out my local garage sales.
4,OXO Good Grips Salad Spinner,"I received this Salad Spinner from the Amazon returns dept. in the OXO Good Grip Salad Spinner's own pkging with no additonal boxing or taping of any kind from Amazon. I orderd a new one so not sure why it came from the returns dept. Everything seemed to be in the box so I kept it and so far have been pleased with the results WHEN USED on lettuce. Not so much on Cherries LOL Box said you can use on berries so I decided to try on some cherries I had washed, bruised them a bit to much & didn't remove much of the water from them. I haven't tried to use it on anything else. Gave it 4 stars since it did a decent job on the lettuce."
5,perfect size for one or two people,"I love the mini version of this salad spinner. It holds enough greens for a couple of dinner salads, works very well, and it's easy to store because of the smaller size. Mine has been going strong for a couple of years. I love it for washing and drying herbs from the garden in the summer."
3,Plastic smell remains and handles would be helpful,"I bought this salad spinner years ago and although the spinning mechanism works well, it would be far superior if it had side handles as you have to use two hands to move it with the lid on. Also when the spinner is covered and not in use the plastic off-gasses are pretty strong when you remove the lid between uses. I would prefer a stainless steel of the same spinning quality that also had side handles."
5,Saves you time and money,"I was buying pre-washed salads at least once a week at a cost of $4 each, and it was only good enough to serve 2 people. Often the salad mix was old. I finally bought one of these so I could buy farmer market lettuce for $1, and it last for 2 to 3 meals. I prep the lettuce when I get home from the market, it takes about 20 minutes, but I have fresh lettuce that lasts 1-2 weeks if you properly dry it and put it in paper towels. I recently read that pre-washed lettuce was dirtier then regular lettuce, so I'll never go back to store bought pre-washed salad mix. Love this salad spinner."
5,I LOVE this salad spinner,"I shopped around for about a month and looked at several different brands of spinner but the Oxo seemed to be the heftiest of the bunch. It's solid and has very few parts that can break. This is a long-haul type of kitchen tool.Beyond the quality of the spinner, I am amazed at the ability of this little machine to keep lettuce fresh! I grew green leaf lettuce this spring and had a ton of it! I was giving it to neighbors in an attempt to clear it out of the garden. One of my neighbors came back within three days asking for more because hers had already grown wilted and brown. Mine, on the other hand, stayed fresh for three weeks! Three days versus three weeks is a big improvement for a little plastic bowl!Needless to say, I heartily recommend this appliance. What an amazing little gadget!"
4,can't go in the dishwasher!!,"The bowl part (the part you wash all the time) can't go in the dishwasher....it warps, and then you can't use it anymore. Ask me how I know....."
4,Agree it's great ... but it has 1 huge problem,"This has got to be the best salad spinner ever, on that point I agree with all the other rave reviews. But just try picking this unit up off a shelf when you have wet hands--or even dry hands!!!!!!! It's difficult!!!! Just wish they would put a small, very small, handle, ridge or inset on the bowl!!! Please!!!"
4,Great Little Tool,"My wife and I eat lots of salads and really enjoy this product. We use it when we come home from the store to clean all our greens. Very good, affordable product!"
5,Perhaps the best invention since bagged salads,"I can't believe I ever lived without this salad spinner. The pump design is flawless - three or four pumps and you can leave your produce to spin dry. The bowl is perfectly balanced; those couple of pumps allow it to spin almost five minutes if the inside sieve is not completely filled. And, best of all, the whole unit stores very easily with the other plastic bowls and whatnots. I used this to clean organic spinach the other day. It you are a fan of such, you have most likely encountered grit in even the best hand-washed variety. Not with the salad spinner! Furthermore, the leaves stay crisp and fresh. I've also used this with leeks and mushrooms and other hard to clean produce. You won't believe how much better and fresher your food will taste."
1,It spun for about 5 weeks,"I bought the smaller unit. This spinner was fun to use and really did a great job of spinning the water out of freshly cleaned lettuce. But cleaning the unit is difficult. The top/lid is supposed to easily snap apart for cleaning. This happened effortlessly the first time. The second time was more difficult. By about the fifth time I could not separate the two halves. Instead the plunger mechanism unlocked itself, the spring popped out - and I was never able to reassemble the unit (without cracking the plastic). Cleaning this unit is an exercise in frustration!"
5,OXO Scores High Marks Again!,"The OXO line of products are absolutely fantastic. I have almost all of their products in my kitchen, and have no regrets of buying any of them. Sure, their products cost a little more than the other competition, and people are hesitant to spend more money for a product without knowing the features or reasons why the product costs more. The Salad Spinner is wonderful! The bowl has no holes to drain the water, which is kind of wierd, but never fear! You just empty the water out, and it works better thn the ones with the holes in them. The bowl is proper for serving on the table, too! No need to mess another bowl."
5,This Salad Spinner is For You.,Spins well and dries lettuce as expected. Main plastic bowl should be designed a bit thicker. I won't place the large acrylic bowl in the dishwasher for fear of it losing it's shape from excessive heat. Great product and would have rated it a 5 star if the bowl was a bit heavier. You won't be disappointed. I recommend you purchase the spinner.
4,"Works well, holds up to preschooler inflicted abuse","We eat a lot of greens in our house so this gets used almost every day. It does its job well, and is easy to operate. I appreciate the plunger lock which enables it to store more compactly, and has proven itself durable. My 3 year old loves to put small toys in it to spin, and it has held up just fine."
4,Works great,"I bought this salad spinner when the one I purchased at Target broke. It had a pull cord that jammed, so I was looking to avoid that feature. This one works great. I normally do two spins to be very thorough. I spin once, open it up, take out the basket, tip out any liquid, shake the lettuce in the basket, reassemble and spin once more. If you're prepping a lot of greens, I recommendProgressive International LKS-06 Lettuce Keeperto store lettuce for a week+. Also, this might just be me, but I'm not totally comfortable using the bowl to serve from as others have described. I mean, aren't you spinning off water that is removing dirt and chemicals from the greens? And aren't those chemicals and dirt thus being spun onto the sides of the bowl? It would make a nice serving bowl, but I'd probably wash it post spin and pre serve."
5,Very easy to use and it works great.,This thing really does work great. Keeps salad clean and fresh. The plastic will have some staining over time but doesn't effect the use of the product. I would buy another any time I needed one. The top pump part does lock down for easier storage.
4,"Great Design, Not Sturdy Enough","I finally broke down after years of drying lettuce on paper towels and bought the OXO Good Grips Salad Spinner. It performed as promised, making a salad became a breeze. After owning it for 6 months and making use of it about twice a month, the push down handle completely broke from the spindle, rendering the whole spinner useless. This happened on Christmas Day while I was preparing a large meal for several guests. I am very disappointed that a simple kitchen gadget costing [price]had such a short life."
2,Mine broke,"My OXO Good Grips Mini Salad Spinner performed the task decently when it worked. You put the colander in the plastic bowl, put the cover on, and press the big pump to spin. Pretty simple, well designed.The problem is that the ""patented pump mechanism"" broke recently. I had been using it for perhaps a year or two. A plastic piece inside the spinner cover broke, and I can't find a way to fix it. I'm left with a colander, a bowl, and a non-functional spinner cover. Perhaps I pushed the knob too forcefully, or perhaps I got a lemon, although it looks like a few other reviewers on this product have reported similar problems.I generally think OXO makes well-designed products, and I don't mind paying the premium price. But in this case, I'd hesitate to buy another of these."
4,"Useful product, if you have the storage","Great product, works just as advertised. EVen did a great, gentle, job with Berries. Was given to me as gift, when I was in a tiny apartment. I had no cabinet space so it became a, decorative piece above my fridge when not in use. But that is not OXO's fault. I really enjoy this product."
3,Great design for drying salad...,"...but this is not for washing! When I first got this spinner, I was in love. It has a great design and simple one handed operation. However, I think in the design process OXO forgot the greatest feature of the old skool salad spinner: an opening on the top for water to enter, and drainage holes on the bottom. These missing features allow you to run water through the spinner, washing the greens. Pitty OXO forgot about this! This spinner is great for drying only."
1,Worked for about a year,"Worked for about a year. Then the plastic gear spinning mechanism broke. The spin brake button lasted about 3 months before breaking. Find another model, avoid this one."
5,One great spinner,"I really like the quality of this product and have been very pleased with how it's made. It is larger than I expected, which makes it great to do a large salad. It comes with a lid that makes the spinner become the salad bowl. A great duel-duty product!"
5,OXO Does It Again!,I had an older salad spinner that had the horrible pull string on it. It eventually broke so I was turned off from buying another one.I eat alot of green salads and I also have to clean fresh herbs both for cooking and also for my pet rabbit who loves parsely and cilantro. I decided to try this one since OXO has never let me down. This spinner is excellent! It has a rubber bottom to keep it from slipping and the push spin makes it fast and easy to dry greens.The materials are sturdy. Much better than my old one. This was a good investment.
5,You NEED this!,"I never thought I'd need one. But then my aunt gave me her old one and I used it to make her happy when she visited and wow, I fell in love. 7 years later, the basket broke. I tried going back to the old ways but couldn't. I make salads for my family several times a week so I bought a new one. I get tons of use out of this. It's fun, it's easy and it works"
3,"Sounds nice in theory, but mediocre in practice","Advertised as being easy to operate with one hand, but I find this is not the case. I like to get a really vigorous spin going, and the spinner wobbles around so much that I need to stabilize it with the other arm. All told, it takes only slightly more effort to use a crank handle or string pull operated spinner; these traditional designs also seem to get the greens drier."
1,Salad Spinner disappointment,"The item pictured was what I wanted (a better OXO model). I was very disappointed to see what I received. Reviews are bad for the one I received (easily broken). I paid $29.99 to Amazon. I could have got this exact same model at Bed, Bath and Beyond for the same price less 20% ($6.00) with a coupon. They mail coupons out all the time. I should have sent it back to Amazon, but I just didn't want the hassle. Amazon is a good source for many products. But, I will be very careful, when ordering anything, in the future."
1,OXO Salad Spinner,"I was very, very disappointed in this product. It's heavy and I found it not roomy enough for one head of lettuce with the mechanism inside the bowl. It can't be hung so it takes a lot of cupboard space. As far as I'm concerned, this product rates a minus whatever. I gave it away. I want the old Copco - that worked!!!!"
1,disappointed,"The lid on the spinner arrived cracked. The mailing package was intact, I question the sellers quality control."
1,Poor Quality - Waste of Money,"It broke the second time I used it.I bought this product because I liked the smaller size and trusted the Oxo brand. What a mistake! The second time I used it, I set it, per the instructions, but when I pushed the pump mechanism, it went down half way and then jammed. I tried everything, I even took it apart and put it back together, but the stupid thing would not function properly. I would advase against buying this product."
1,oxo,I was very disappointed in this item. My daughter has one and loves it but the one I received did not work and I had to send it back.
4,Too Big!,"Although it functions great, it is too big for my tiny kitchen. I re-gifted this and purchased the smaller version for my family of four!"
5,Simply the best,"This is the perfect salad spinner. Easy to use, easy to clean, looks great, easy to spin."
2,Just okay...,I'm still looking for the perfect salad spinner. I had this one and broke it after trying to take the lid apart to try to clean under the lid--don't attempt that! I didn't like how this one had a domed lid so you couldn't stack stuff on top of it. I also found that the interior of the basket wasnt smooth but a bumpy basket weave so little bits of lettuce get stuck in it.
5,Great Product,It's small enough for quick wash jobs but can handle a larger portion as well. You could fill to wash and then spin or simply rinse and spin...it's the ideal household salad spinner :)
5,OXO Salad Spinner,"I actually bought this as a gift for my daughter-in-law. She requested it and I was happy to oblige. She loves it. In fact, I think I should get one too because of her reaction."
1,Received the wrong item...twice!,"I purchased this CD, ""Creedance Clearwater Revival, 20 Bit K2"" and received ""Bayou Country, 20 Bit K2"". I contacted customer service, returned the CD and re-purchased ""Creedance Clearwater Revival, 20 Bit K2"" again online. I just received it today and they've sent ""Bayou Country, 20 Bit K2"" AGAIN! The problem is the UPC sticker on the back of the CD displays the UPC number and title for ""Creedence Clearwater Revival, 20 Bit K2"" CD. However, the CD itself is ""Bayou Country, 20 Bit K2"". The person packing the order needs to verify the title of the CD and not just rely solely on a small sticker on the back. I will be returning this CD again and won't be able to purchase it until the vendor, Newbury Comics, rectifies their error.Update: 3rd time's the charm! I finally received the correct CD!"
3,"Nice remaster, but it's no vinyl","As others have mentioned here, the musical content of this record is of the highest quality, but the sound quality of the remaster leaves a little to be desired. It may be the best CD version of this album yet, but as seems to be the case with many 70s remasters (like Zeppelin) modern day engineers insist on clipping the digital signal on the disc, which is especially evident here on the cymbals. I understand the need to make these classic rock albums sound more ""loud"", ""rock"" and ""hard hitting"", but not all of us listen to these albums on our car stereo or home theatre system. Not to sound like an old record, but the original vinyl is still leagues better than this remaster. I look forward to hearing the SACD."
4,Chili Dogs,"I used to watch this on Television, and it is probably one of those shows that unless you saw while growing up, and liked it, you won't like it now. It's definitely worth it if you're a Sonic fan, if only because it's Sonic...Very lighthearted compared to SatAM, and was not nearly as well received although it was aired MUCH more. For anyone not quite sure, but thinks they remember.. This is the one where Sonic is obsessed with chili dogs. I always waited for his little life lesson at the end to be something like, ""And remember, kids! Chili dogs DO NOT make you run fast!"" ... But alas..."
5,Great order,Like order I will order again if needed. It was a gift for my sister it's great purchase thank you.
5,I use to watch this when I was a kid.,It was amazing seeing this again and its a awesome dvd set for any sonic fan.
1,WRONG ITEM!!! DO NOT ORDER!!!,I ordered this item but instead I gotSonic The Hedgehog - The Complete Series...which is an item I already own!CHECK THE PRODUCT DETAILS. They are identical toSonic The Hedgehog - The Complete Series!!!DO NOT ORDER UNTIL THE PROBLEM IS FIXED
5,The Greatest Sonic The Hedgehog DVD,"This is the greatest DVD that features the Adventures of Sonic The Hedgehog. It has all of the episodes of the series, and they are all entertaining. I used to have two of these episodes on tape, and now I can see them again after many years. This item is a great gift for an avid Sonic fan, or for someone who liked the show."
2,why was a disk missing ?,"when I had recived the 2nd volume one of the 4 disk was missing, I want a new one that has all of the disk. when I had orded Volume one I got all 4 disk. why was a disk of volume 2 missing ????? I hope something is indeded to be done about this."
5,Supersonic Nostalgic Fun,"Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog is just plain fun. While this Sonic and Tails tag-along might have you cringing at a few cheesy lines here and there, it's a funny, fast-moving classic that packs a lot of nostalgic punch for those of us who grew up watching it in the 90's. Not only that, it's loaded with old-school Sonic spirit. It's great to see this classic piece of Sonic history coming to DVD!"
2,Don't bother with this,"This Box set is a rippoff. It has only the first season, which wasn't one of the best ones, all of the other seasons are the good ones. I got the complete series of this show on one box set on ebay. It is a region 2 DVD set but that problem can esely be fixed. I highly recomend that set to all you people wanting to see this series."
2,classic cadillac,"Dear amazon.com The book in question,is more of a junior pisture book than information data.Im sure the seller was happy to sell it,as the book itself was very used.Anyway,I have it now and will keep it in my personel collection"
5,Clear and well-written,"The author does a great job summarizing common PHP characteristics and elaborating on PHP 5 improvements, with plenty of well-chosen code examples. Well suited for the established PHP programmer making the transition to PHP 5. For those starting out, use ""Learning PHP 5"" instead."
3,Introducing Ian Keith As Vitamin Flintheart,DICK TRACY VERSUS CUEBALL was a 1946 movie about a bald-headed robber and murderer who was sought by Dick Tracy. It was the second Dick Tracy film produced by RKO Radio Pictures and it marked the final appearances of Morgan Conway in the role of Dick Tracy and Anne Jeffreys as Tess Trueheart. The cast also included Dick Wessell in the role of Cueball and Ian Keith as Vitamin Flintheart.
3,Cup size indicators wear off,"I am a avid collector of all things OXO--but these are going back to the OXO Corp. today. The ""1"", ""1/2"", ""1/3"" cup etc. indicators are made of an embedded paper & wear out over time, so you have to try & figure out if you have the right cup, especially on the frequently used cups-not handy when you're in the middle of a recipe."
5,Often my favorite Creedence album,"Now, I know that Pendulum is typically seen as one of the ""weaker"" Creedence albums, but I beg to differ! With cuts as strong as ""Pagan Baby"" and ""Born to Move"" how could you go wrong?? I used to play in a band that did a cover of ""Born to Move"", and it always got people on the floor. Sadly, most folks then came up and said ""great tune! is that an original?"" Buy this CD and help set the record straight..."
2,Not there best album,This is not an album I would would not recommend. It has a few good songs (Have you ever seen the rain and Hideaway) but other than those there is nothing special. If you want to buy a creedence album I would recommend their gteatest hits volume 1.
5,One of the best cd's of all time,"This cd is just great. The first cd has most of their best songs (with a few notable exceptions), but the second cd is where thing really get good, i've never heard a live performance that was even as remotely good as this one is. One of my favorites."
2,Not A Great Way To Get Acquainted With The Pixies,"""Surfer Rosa"" and ""Doolittle"" are much better introductions to the Pixies. I'm sure a lot of people new to the group enjoy this compilation, but it's nowhere near as cohesive or brilliant as those early masterpiece albums, which are filled to the brim with awesome material and arranged perfectly. In fact, Death To The Pixies puts too much focus on some of their lesser, later work. Disc Two, the live portion, is a nice show but it's a shame for Pixies fans to have to shell out extra cash for the accompanying 'best of' CD just to get it.I give it two stars because the music is good, but the arrangement is not. Pixies were an album band, and compilations only degrade their impact."
4,Stephen doesnt know anything,"Stephen Walter wrote a review about this cd saying he had heard all their songs before. Well guess what, that was his first Pixies cd and he knows nothing about them. He's just a poser that burns people cd's without permission and buys shirts of bands he knows nothing about. All in all the cd is still very good. Die!"
1,"Awful, just awful.","I can't really say much about the whole album. I just happened to watch the video for ""Ojos Negros"" and I had to write something! The song was so bad, the music was generic, and the lyrics were just as bad (especially the English added). The video was so cliched it just made me laugh. I just can't get over how awful this song was.I'd take Shakira over Ms. Manterola anyday. Having a nice body doesn't equal having talent. Sorry."
1,Not worth even $1.00,The shower cap fell apart the first time I put it on my head. The elastic was so cheap and poorly sewn that it crumbled the first time it was stretched. Not worth the return shipping to send it back -- I'll try my local pharmacy instead.
5,Naruto Wear!,"The image of a very cute Naruto in his 'relaxing' or 'playful' pose!Item is very soft - doesn't scratch, itch, bind or pinch. Can be worn by an adult or child, ( stretches smoothly )."
4,Nice quiet sound,"They really have a quiet sound, not annoying at all, and they are constructed in a way that there has to be quite some air disturbance, wind, for it to chime. Sound is subdued, like it."
4,Good vibrations,The sound of these chimes is soothing and very rich for the size of the unit. I am very pleased with the mood that it sets.
4,Takes more than a gentle breeze....,"First, I will say that I would buy this again if given the opportunity. The product is as described...high quality and beautiful. The sound is wonderful. However, it does take more than a gentle breeze for these chimes to sound. I'm not sure why, but even when the ""windcatcher"" or ""feather"" is moving, it doesn't always translate to enough movement to produce the ringing. I live in very windy Oklahoma and the chimes are silent most of the time. They did sound beautiful during the last thunderstorm, though! Maybe I need to hang them in a different location?? Or maybe we're just having an unusual breezeless period?In any case, I would have given these a 5 except for the amount of wind required for the chimes to sound."
5,Flying the Boeing 777,"The finest book I've seen that combines both excellent technical descriptions of the various 777 aircraft systems together with an excellent Captain's narrative of a North Atlantic crossing from London's Heathrow airport to Boston, Massachusetts. If you want learn about the Boeing 777 and how it's flown in actual line operations, this is the book to read!"
3,KARL DELIVERED THIS BOOK DOES NOT,THIS BOOK IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT KARL MALONE NBA SUPERSTAR. BUT ALOT OF THIS BOOK IS SPENT ON THE HISTORY OF THE JAZZ AND MANY OTHERS PLAYERS. IT IS NOT A BAD BOOK BUT NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. OK READ.
5,The Big Golden Animal ABC Garth Williams d,Loved the product ..I will use this dealer in the future ...Hope to buy more product as the book was great
5,I dream this album,"I swiped this album from my college radio station years ago and I've absolutely worn it out. It is a great sampler since it has songs of both the upbeat and the tragic variety. Makes great road trip music. My faves are ""Marie"" and ""Bonsoir, Moreau."" The latter is so deeply imbedded in my memory that I have actually dreamed about it! Most of these songs are a little rough around the edges, though - - it isn't an album for those that like a clean studio recording or ""candy-coated"" Cajun."
5,A Must Have,"""A candidly honest and insightful eye opener into the world of dating violence, this book is a must-read for all teenage girls!""Heather Molnar, Miss Teen Maryland 2001"
3,Already outdated by 1999,"This book is on a topic that is evolving so quickly across the world that its usefulness must have lasted a whole 9 months. It is written from the perspective of an international lawyer, which means there is little actual applications in here for the practitioner from the banking or user perspectives. It includes some interesting information that would save a lot of time to compile, such as the existence of ""true sale"" financial flow transactions in certain countries, but it is sparse.To me, the most interesting aspect of this book is the historical one, showing how much emerging markets securtiizations have evolved since it was published."
5,MIDWEST BOOK REVIEW,"When I first received this book, I was not particularly lookingforward to the read. After all, how exciting could a book beabout a tree farm? I sat down to do my duty as a reviewer and Iwas in for a delightful surprise!Darrell Bain took me on a journey of continual giggles, as he toldthe tales of their Christmas Tree Farm. Who wold have everimagined that so much adventure could be found there? Not I!He tells you in many different delightful stories the differentaspects of tree farming and the adventures they have with allthe customers each year.If you want a joyful Holiday read, this is the one for you.It might just make you glad for the profession you have chosen, Inever realized how difficult it was to grow a tree! Excellent read, well worth your time."
4,Not classic bossa but very good,"I really dig this album. Especially Gil Evans arrangements. It's not classic bossanova, but that's what I like about it. The intro on the Brazilian classic ""Felicidade"" is absolutely great."
3,"Not her best album, but still highly enjoyable","Astrud's voice is best kept to an intimate setting, and for a few songs here that is realized, but too much of ""Rainbow"" is more on the brassy side, which doesn't suit Astrud. Still, ""I Will Wait For You"" gets it's best reading here, and the title track is very spritely and melodic. Not her best, but if you enjoy Gilberto's deep, slightly off-center vocals and her sweet coo, you'll get a sultry groove on nevertheless. 'B'"
2,Boring to the Max,"What a disappointment - the selections are hum drum, the back-up renditions uninspiring and Astrid's delivery lackluster. I certainly would not recommend anyone purchase this CD, unless, of course, one is so devoted to Astrid you just had to have it to add to a collection."
4,"Yo, Brizz is da ish","I've been a fan since the early LFO days.... I'm still bitter over the fact that the album he recorded with them was never released. *sigh* But it's all good cause this one rocks too. ;oD My favorite track is Badawayo... I absolutely love that one. I got the chance to see Brizz preform live @ Music Midtown 2002 in Atlanta in May and I loved it!! I finally got to meet him after waiting 6 years too.... if you ever yead this, I LOVE YOU!! Your new band rocks and so does the CD ;oD (and if you can, get me a copy of that first LFO CD lol)"
4,We sing and do actions while we read it!,"My toddler loves for me to sing the wheels on the bus while we read this book. The pictures are cute. He especially loves buses anyway. Pages include children... go up and down- people... go in and out- windows... go up and down- doors...open and close- horn... goes toot, toot, toot-wiper...goes swish, swish, swish- driver... goes stop and go. Its a lot of fun."
3,Great Celtic,This is a very thin peice of cloth with a beautiful celtic design. I caution people when purchasing this due to the fabric has a strong (burlap) odor that is hard to get to out even with repeated washings. I have finally removed the odor on all my fabrics and have them displayed throughout my house!
4,Hapkido?,"This is one of those great Hong Kong movies from the 70's. It is fun to watch and it is full of the flamboyant martial arts techniques common to all Hong Kong films. My question is, what does this movie have to do with Hapkido? Though the lead actress is supposed to be a master of Hapkido, I didn't see one true Hapkido technique in the whole film. But it is a fun movie to watch."
5,Music captured the spirit of ADVENTURE!,Raiders of the Lost Ark has the BEST Indiana Jones music. This CD captured the spirit of Adventure! The previously unreleased tracks were fantastic! Highly recommended!
5,Fantastic,"This is a fantastic movie I've seen more than once. It deserves five starts, even though...well, I don't like how the ending goes all supernatural...it mars an otherwise straight adventure film...and I thought the ark being stored in a warehouse was kind of anticlimactic...but most of the movie is so great, it's a great movie."
5,raiders of the lost ark soundtrack,"some of the best music from john williams , with added score that wasnt avaiable from the original release in the eighties this is very high end adventure at its best."
4,Hard rock rolls you all day,A great CD of an old movie. The we will rock you version is awesome. The rest of the CD gets you rocking on your way to work or wherever else you might be going.
1,"I Admire West Point, But This Does Not Live Up To The Hype","I was disappointed. After all the hype, I thought this was a substantial work, but it isn't. It is mostly pictures. The pictures are nice but it offers nothing, and text-wise, not enough of it for the price. I'm sorry to say this about Westpoint, but I somewhat resent being misled. It could have taken me but 5 minutes to flip through it at a bookstore to see it was not for me."
1,Celebrate -- And Give Us Your Money! .... Ugh.,"Ugh. Another West Point coffee table book. The concept is the same as we have seen repeatedly in the past. It's a book of mainly pictures, with sound bites of ideas that can be covered in 5 pages. The result is 95% fluff, 5% something of value. It seems everyone is trying to bilk unwitting customers under the guise of doing something noble for West Point's Bicentennial. What spin. Forgive me for laughing at authors' and publishers' perceptions of altruism! I think, if they are sincere about wanting others to help them celebrate 200 years of this noble and great institution, they should pass out their books-of-celebration for FREE! Uh-oh. The emperor has no clothes?"
4,It's just a coffee table book!,"Take this book for what it is, a nice coffee table book (and I can go see the place any day I want as I live 4 miles away). For those looking for meat, I would personally suggest the Long Gray Line. For interesting views on how the world at the academies once was it would be the Lords of Discipline. On another note, to the parent in TX, I am sure they would be happy to give away free copies but then Uncle Sam would be footing the bill. Maybe you should just accept that your son/daughter got a great $250K education in return for a 5 yr committment to serve their country. What more do you want???"
2,tones are the same!,"I purchased this tone set to use in my kindergarten classroom. The description states that there are two different tones, however the item I received did not have two different tones. What is the point of having two tones when they are the same?"
2,Not Received as Promised...,"The description states I should receive 11 different colors of 3mm beads containing 20 beads each, totaling 220 3mm crystals. I only received 5 different colors of 3mm crystals, totaling 100 3mm crystals.It states in the listing I should receive 5 different colors of 6mm beads containing 10 each, totaling 50 6mm crystals. What I received was 4 different colors containing 10 each, 40 total 6mm crystals.Here's the odd part... It also states I should get 11 bags of 4mm beads containing 30 crystals each, or 330 4mm crystals. What I received was 22 bags of 4mm crystals containing 20 beads each, which is a total of 440 4mm crystals.Conclusion? I should have bought the lot of 500 4mm beads for more than $10 cheaper... Not worth it!UPDATEAfter posting this review, I got an email from LK saying ""Thanks for let us know the changing description. I just checked and corrected it. Please accept our apology for this unexpected problem."" No offer to fix the problem, just 'I'm sorry""..."
2,bad deal,This is 90 % 4mm beads Not as described in the description. Better deals to be had on 4 mm beads
4,Definitely worthwhile,"This was the first Kat Martin book I had ever read. My mother in law bought this book and a Lisa Kleypa's book, Lady Sophia's Lover at the same time. She read the Kleypas book while I read Kat Martin's book, and then we switched. This books was great. Prior to this, I was never into romance books, and especially not historical romance. Heaving bosoms were not my thing. Give me a good mystery or some true crime.But after I read this book, I was hooked. I devour every Kat Martin book I can get my hands on. My mother in law and I like to go to thrift stores all the time, and I usually manage to get a ton of books for very little money, and I have found tons of Kat Martin books for about 50 cents a piece. Can't beat that.This one is totally worth the regular price though. Grab it and enjoy."
3,"Not My Favorite, But A Good Passtime","I'm a big fan of Kat Martin, and over the years have found her novels to be fun reads time and again. Fanning the Flames is certainly fun, but it's not the best of her offers. The characters are witty, so although the stories a bit thin, there's enough there to hold the interest."
5,great,"I have one of these mounted on my quilting bench to hang my cutters and another on the deck railing to hang the barbecue tools. They do not rust and look nice, Great price."
1,This book was not helpful in preparing my driving tour.,"We purchased this book in preparation for a road trip in Spain. The maps have no detail and serve no real purpose. The descriptions of locations and drives are scanty and the photos look about 25 years old. This time, the cover sold the book and the inside does not live up to it!"
2,A Fair Compilation,"This is a decent punk compilation covering a long time period. There is early pre punk (Stooges),70's punk (Gand Of Four,X),80's hardcore (Suicidal Tendencies,Black Flag), and newer bands (Lagwagon,MxPx). My main complaints about this cd are that Gimme Gimme Gimme isn't a from Henry Rollins era Black Flag and it has too much ska which I don;t really consider punk. Overall I'd give it about 2 1/2 stars."
5,"With Fantastic Games and Great Graphics, PSX is the standard","I don't need to bore you with a long list of reasons to own a PSX. Here's a short one:The graphics are great, the sound is fantastic, and the huge and substantive library of games is unbeatable. Howevever, the main reason to buy a Playstation now is the price. With fantastic games like ""Metal Gear Solid"" and ""Final Fantasy VII"" available for only 20 dollars, and the unit being available new for less than a hundred, and used for around seventy, PSX is the perfect system for the first time video gamer or the dorm-bound video game junkie."
1,The worst systerm in the world,worst graphics so you can barely see what you are playing. not realistic. overheats in like 45 min. takes forever to load(33mHz) Too big of a price for what its really worth. only two controllers. not much memory on the memory cards.Why get a playstation when theres already ps2 out? GET A DREAMCAST OR WAIT FOR X-BOX!
2,An Okay System,"Playstation has okay graphics, the cd has lots of room, etc. But some games take FOREVER to LOAD! For the Nintendo 64, there's NO WAIT! Playstation has a lot of games, but there's only about 2 of them I like. Also, if you accidently scratch the cd, you can't play it! Nintendo 64 is more durable, and takes TIME WITH THEIR GAMES."
1,dis-satisfied buyer,will not purchase from this guy again. not honest with his description of item. buyer's beware!
3,I think that the graphics aren't that good and N64 is a lot,I don't really like sony playstation because of the graphics
1,Wait for the better systems!,"Playstation completely sucks. It can't compete with modern game systems at all! I recommend that you buy a Dreamcast instead, or wait for the new nintendo, x-box, Playstation2, or even that new system coming out made by Mattel. Trust me, skip Playstation and buy something worth your while and money!"
1,playstation is lame,"the playstation WAS good in it's time, 1995, but not today. It is too old and outdated, the CD-ROM is too slow, the graphics are extremley poor, it has no popular or famous characters with ground breaking games, like the N64 and Dreamcast do (Mario and Sonic...). The CD-ROM also tends to crash a lot, the controllers are awkward, (especially the dual shock one) and the only reason people buy it is to play Final Fantasy 7, its only good game, which you can get on the PC by the way, and it's a lot better. Don't waste your money on this trash, in case you didn't know it is made by a company who's known for their TVs, Sony obviously don't know what they are doing, they let their third party developers do the work. If Square (Final Fantasy 7 developers) were going with N64 or Dreamcast, the playstation would be dead by now, and it is falling.Don't waste a penny on this."
4,This is good,"The playstation is a great system. It is no longer the fastest machine, and it is no longer has the best graphics but it is still good. The playstation is ...... and for that low price you get a selection of games from the most massive game selection there is and the games are very cheap. If you buy the drteamcast or N64 you end up paying ......... for one game. you can get three, four, or almost five very good games for the price of one DC or N64 game. The one downside is the loading speeds. The playstation is pretty slow but the games are worth the wait. For example, own the game Mayhem (it's a wrestling game) and it takes 20-30 seconds to load a game, but once it loads it's the best smashing, bashing, and slashing game there is out. So if you are wondering what sytem to get I say playstation or nothing!"
3,its ok....,"The playstation is a great console,but:1.)Takes a long time to load2.)Freezes up some time3.)To bulky4.)Only supports 2 controllers unless you get the add-on 4 person player switchDon't get me wrong Playstation is a great system, but if you want this system, i suggest you go with the ps1, it's portable, its affordable,it barely ever freezes, and with the LCD monitor you can take your ps1 console in the car!"
2,Review for Sony PlayStation,"PlayStation takes much time to load, graphics: not so great, however the game selection is exellent. This System is good, however slightly outdated in comparison with newer Nintendo64 or Dreamcast. PlayStation also does not allow for more than 2 players to play for most games, and games that do allow require extra hardware."
4,Sony Playstation,"The Sony people are genuises! Put out a system that needs to be replaced every few years because it's not capable of handling newer games (heck, my system even gets overwhelmed with Resident Evil 2, let alone Syphon Filter). Unfortunately, it still is the best product on the market, even though it may be the most frustrating system to play when your game requires loading."
2,OLD AND DATED,"Old and Dated is the best way to describe the PSX. While it was a great machine back when it was released in 1995 now it is really showing its age. Now when I try to play a PSX game it's just plain hard to look at because the graphics are well... horriable. With the Dreamcast and the GeForce 256 Video Card for PC's, and Playstation 2 and X-Box on the way. I can not recomend at all you buy this. The only way you can even consider buying one is used for really cheap."
4,A+,"This system is great, it has more and better games than any other system. It is the best gamming system ever made, however if you have the money you should probably wait for the PS2 in September."
3,Slowly fading away,"While the psx is a great system, it is slowly starting to show its age. Compared to DC's load times, the PSX's load times feel like an eternity. Graphic wise, they are very pixilated and in low resilution. The sound is great, but then again, it's CD based, so what do you expect. And with only two controller ports, this isn't a very multiplayer experiance.And to the genius who found PSX games to be too hard, in Metal Gear Solid, the Colonel radios you and tells you to use the second controller port. Also, there are many web sites with strategy guides on them. So no, you don't need to buy a stradegy guide for any of the games.My recommendation: the ps2 is comming out in a year, and will be backwards compatible. So if you buy a ps now, don't expect a long life out of it."
4,PLAYSTATION,"The Playstation is a good system, but watch out for the games! Some games have very sloppy graphics, sound, controls,etc. Take The Mummy. I was gaga over the movie, but the game is worse than horrible. It was boring, hard, and looked like it was just thrown together. Another word of warning. If you have the old Playstation, don't buy the monitor. It will only fit the newer PS1. My friend found that out the hard way. Otherwise, it's a fun game system."
1,poor,"I have been trying to register this since the day of purchase, VERY unsuccessful! Have tried all I can think of and my answer is: it must still be registered from the person I purchased it from. In order for me to use QuarkXpress I will have to upgrade to the present day version. Money spent on this version was a waste and I should send it back or just toss in trash!! Sure hope the person I purchased it from is not scamming anyone else!"
3,Frustrating and difficult.,This program is so difficult to use. I've tried many different graphics programs and this one has to be the worst. Looking for help is even harder because the book is massive. This program is frustrating to say the least.
1,not acceptable,I thought I purchased 5.0 but it's quarkxpress 6.0 passport. I cannot set it up to do the documents right. I cannot do pdf files. they come out with quarkxpress demo on every page. I really needed this software for my business and I feel that I have been ripped off.
1,A Poorly-Made Product,Fashion Express purses are cheaply made and overpriced. The company will not stand behind the quality - or lack thereof - of its product.
2,AWFUL PRODUCTION,"I was chocked by the awful production in this album (compared to theirnext effort, SHOCK TACTICS). It seems to have benn recorded in a garage. It is also clear why Bruce Dickinson left the band. He was shoulders and head above the other musicians, in terms of musical skill. His voice shines like diamond, while Paul Samson's guitar work is weak; well intentioned, but really weak. Of all the SAMSOM albuns, the only worthwhile is SHOCK TACTICS, produced by Tony Platt."
4,Good book on Parrot psychology and behavior modification.,"This book is somewhat uneven. The parts relating parrotbehavior as a pet to parrot behavior in the wild are good.The parts about modifying the behavior of a problem parrotare good, but focus on dealing with extreme cases in aninstitutional setting. Contains good advice on how toavoid turning your bird into a problem in the first place.""Guide to a Well Behaved Parrot"" is cheaper, better written,and better produced. If you can only get one, get that one,but this one is worth having if you can afford both.Pet peeve: low quality black and white illos that look likephotocopied color pictures - some with captions describingthe colors you can't see."
2,"many stories, but not much practical advice","This book did not provide as much advice or information about parrot bevavior as other less expensive books have. It contains mostly stories, and although they are sometimes interesting, they do not address specific behavorial problems and what to do about them."
2,So-So,"This book was so-so. It contains some flat-out wrong informaiton.For the best book on the subject of dealing with the parrot in your life, get ""Parrot Problem Solver."""
3,Not the best book I've found.,"I had had this book for about a year now. Actually, I had forgot I'd even owned it until the pet shop owner, where I purchased one of my birds, suggested it. I dug it out remembered why it was hidden: the author is great at storytelling but not great with supplying options to failed suggestions. I don't recommend it as your only source, rather as part of a library on raising healthy birds."
4,One of the must reads,"For keepers, albeit somewhat outdated, already, in some aspects, in my opinion.Having said that, this book should be kept by all serious keepers."
3,My parrot book,"This book would be good for new parrot owner. It was a little dry to my liking. I had already learned most of the information from being a member of PEAC, a parrot education group based in Cleveland. They give very good seminars on the subjects handled in the book."
2,"BJBichon on ""My Parrot, My Friend""","This book was recommended by another bird site as the only book you will ever need to understand your bird. I think I was expecting too much. It reads a little like a clinical tome; too many words, too little said. Yet, the monochromatic photos and diagrams, editing errors, and misspelled words cause you to question the credibility."
5,"winnie the pooh 6"" plush toy","Gift for an adult,she loved it so did I,very cute,size small,but perfect with fine details.-----quick delivery,on time for Christmas.Thank you."
3,The Green Brain,This is a book that studies the human mind when in a deserted place with no one to help them. An interesting book at the start but it loses steam and never seems to take the next step. It's just centred on the isolation of the three people and the green brain's analysis of these people that try to survive. Strange I'll give it that but it just didn't have enough as it just never got out of second gear to help it along it's way
4,Good stuff.,Frank Herbert has written a lot of short novels. This is one of his better ones. Definitely worth picking up.
4,Good yarn,"While it is Dune that is Frank Herbert's greatest work, his other works should never be overlooked. I enjoyed this book rather much. Not quite as much ad Dune, but few things hold up to Dune. It was a unique and interesting tale about insects and evolution, and I would recommend it to anyone else."
4,Why Is This Not Sold As Combo with Flashlight?,"Does work great as nightlight(red filter) when stargazing; significantly reduces lumenal output.The anti-roll rubber is very handy--the pocket clip, not so much.Still, a resonable price for those fans of Maglite whom are in need."
4,Works well as expected,"I bought the flashlight, rehargable batteries, and the accssory pack as a gift for my niece. She has taken it camping, used it on night hiking, and it now resides in her ""survival bucket"". Obviously she is a happy camper, I would say the accessories which she has on the light are a booming success."
5,Exactly what I needed for my Mini Mag,"This kit provides some great accessories for the MiniMag. The rubber cap fits nicely over the end of the flashlight and is perfect for keeping it from rolling away or propping it up to shine right where you want it. The strap is also handy, and the filters make the light the color of your choice. It's the perfect add-on to make the Mini Mag a little more convenient."
3,Amber lens is not included in this kit,"Be advised that MagLite has changed the content of this kit. Instead of red and amber lenses, the kit now has red, blue, and clear lenses. (The part number of the kit is still AM2A016.)"
2,This doesn't match the description,"The description says that it has an AMBER lens. It does not, so I had to return it."
3,Not quite as advertised,"The product performs well. Only problem is it is not quite as advertised. Ad says it has red, blue and amber colored filters, but actually has red, blue and clear. Unfortunately for me, what I really wanted was the amber!"
2,wasnt even worth it,it came with 2 red lens and a cracked clear one. it didnt even come with the blue lens as the package says it should. the rubber lens holder was broken right out of the package.
3,Could have been a lot better...,"The album is decent but it was definetely not worth what I paid. It has good tracks but I think it would be better if you heard them first and them purchased them individually because the album as a whole is not a good investment. I also thought that the fact that they included Punjabi MC in a ""chillout"" album was unnecessary and distasteful."
3,Pretty but not big enough.,The bag looks great but it's not organized well. Front compartment is awkward to use.
4,Excellent,"This is a very excellent tool to have for the kitchen!! Kids will often only eat an apple if it is sliced, peeled, and or cored. This is a very handy item, that makes preparing fruits very easy. You also get even slices, and the kids can do it!"
2,"A nice idea, but ...","... after using my apple slicer for about one year, the plastic has begun to crack. And the slicer could, indeed, be larger. I am now searching for a durable all-metal slicer."
4,"Not all Christmas-themed, but still nice for the holidays","---------------------------------------------------""Angelina Ballerina Holiday Gift Set""(Hit Entertainment, 2011)---------------------------------------------------This 3-DVD box set is billed as a holiday collection, although not all of the episodes are Christmas related. It includes on holiday episode, ""The Nutcracker Sweet,"" but also a bunch of regular old Angelina episodes where she tries out for big parts and learns to get along with family and friends. We were big fans of the original Angelina Ballerina books, though the videos didn't have quite the same feel. But if you're searching for a present for younger girly-girl Angelina fan, this set has a lot of content - over three hours worth of stories! (DJ Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain children's media reviews)"
4,CCR,GREAT CD WOW IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I LISTEN TO THISWON'T BE SO LONG NOW THAT I OWN IT.GLAD I GOT IT.
3,"Sometimes this cooks a little, but I like my blues smouldering","This early JBU cd has its moments, but largely, it was a bad purchase for me. JBU's voice has mellowed with age and I prefer him now. I also didn't have much chemistry with Aubrey Dale, a rock drummer who can bang it out but who apparently doesn't have much of a blues connection. This one's going in the ""sell"" pile...Should really be 2 stars...NEXT!!"
3,blue music,"This cd has a good mellow feel to it, that makes it nice to listen to as background music, or when you just want to chill out. On the whole the cd is not badly put together and Ulmer takes his music seriousely. However, it is not an excellent album, and although all of the songs are alright, none of them are great."
2,CCR go out with a whimper,"There's a reason this is much maligned; it's a very poor swan song from CCR. Fogerty checks in briefly with two terrific songs--the country opener Lookin' For A Reason and Someday Never Comes. Sweet Hitchhiker, despite a roaring guitar riff and a great Fogerty vocal, is CCR by the numbers. Stu Cook and Doug Clifford contribute some interesting numbers but they lack the focus and power of Fogerty's weakest material much less his strongest. Most of the originals sound like second hand garage rock knock offs of popular songs.The reality was this; CCR had returned to The Golliwogs. For the first time in their history CCR sounded like a pale imitation of themselves and half a dozen other bands. Like The Beatles' Let It Be, Madri Gras was anti-climax to a brief but bright career as America's finest rockers."
2,Stylish yet not very secure.,"The Good:Great PriceStylishProtects the phone when you drop (and boy have I)Easy access to phoneThe Bad:Does not stay on my belt! For an active person (I am in the IT department of my company) this case comes off way to easily. The way it secures is not by having your belt run through the clip by merely sliding it over your belt. This is ok for people who tend not to be on the move. But as I drive a lot, as well as move/lift/climb over/crawl under many things, this clip comes off way to easily.Does not allow chargin of the phone while in its holster. (Yeah I know it takes a second to pop it out, but I am always on the go)Summary:For an active user this is 2 stars, for a non active user this is a 4 star device."
1,Agree with previous reviewer,"I also have a problem with this holster not staying on my person. Although, my problem with the holster is that I have it clipped to my belt but the holster sometimes comes off by itself and I blame this on the design. All you have to do to get the case off is turn it 90 degrees and pull up. I have a PDA case with a similar design but it requires you to push a lever to have the case come off and it has never accidentally come of because of that lever. I have had the Siemens case come off many times when I was sitting and yesterday it came off on the street when I was reaching for something. It's a good thing a good samaritan found my phone and contacted me or else I would be out a phone. This is a good case if you don't plan on keeping the case on your belt but if you do I would look for something else. I currently have a Krusell case on order to replace this one. After yesterday's incident I don't plan on using it anymore."
3,Decent but superficial,"The framework of this book attempts to relate the railroad toAmerican life, but provides very few specific insights. Changessuch as standard time, commuting, etc. are minimally covered.As a general railroad history, it is superficial. Essentially it triesto cover too much, and it is not tightly written. A fast reader orone cursed with a good memory will see constant repitition ofminor interesting points in several chapters, making the book feelpadded. I'd pass on this one"
4,"Finally, something different.","I applaud Douglas for breaking away from the typical approach to railroad history. It seems like every other book follows the ""all hail the railroad"" model. Douglas tries to tie railroading into the social fabric of American history. I think it is an approach that is long over due."
5,Keith Jarrett on ECM,"ECM records has been responsible for making available a wide range of quality music over the years. As a company, they remain a first rate example of people merging commerce with music, while insuring that music of integrity remains their guiding principle.ECM's early years feature a wide range of jazz and ethnically flavored musical collaborations. The recent years have added strong new music offerings which are influenced by the classical and contemplative worlds.""My Song"" is one of the finest examples of Jazz from the ECM early period. This recording features piano by Keith Jarrett, Saxophones by Jan Garbarek, Bass by Palle Danielsson and Jon Christensen on Drums.The mood of this recording is one of warm optimism, with a light, free spirited approach that I find to be emotionally open and highly accessible. If you find ECM to be a label whose sonic identity you tend to trust, then you could hardly do better than to purchase and listen to this fine collection of songs."
4,My Song by Keith Jarret,I'm not a Jazz lover per se but this CD was to my taste in 4 out of 6 items. The remaining two tracks which I found too much for my taste I'm certain would have thrilled Jazz fans. On the whole had to admit to the brilliance of composition and just plain good music.As for the business end of the deal all went like clock work.
2,Some nuggets of wisdom can be found,"You are not alone. That is one of the first messages of Senior Choices -- that many senior couples are addressing the same issues of whether to live together and, if so, the pros and cons of being married.There are other nuggets of wisdom in this book as well....for example, suggestions of things to think about, viewpoints of different kinds of relationships.However, to find this wisdom you have to be willing to suffer through a lot of repetition, an arrangement of subject matter that, to me, is disorganized and illogical, and many grammatical errors that will drive you nuts if you have any editing experience. But just take a deep breath and read on a little faster, and you will learn some satisfying stuff."
3,ORCHESTRA?,"Being a huge fan of Cirque du Soleil's music, I highly anticipated another musicians' interpretation. It could have been much better than this re-enactment. Where's the orchestra? All instruments are performed on synthesizers, except for a few human vocals here and there. I must say that the vocalist on ""Let Me Fall"" did a fine job (not as nice as Josh Groban, however). There are no credits anywhere to be found, so, I have no idea who did the singing. Cirque du Soleil's music invokes a dynamic emotion that is hard to duplicate and unfortunately, there just is none of the magic present in this collection of songs."
3,Hard Hittin Hair Metal,"I'm a Hair Metal fanatic and I've been going through a lot of old Hair Metal cassettes I just bought. I went through a ton of albums and most of them sucked. I didn't have much faith in Shotgun Messiah, and then, boom, it rocked. Bop City just plain owns, the way Zinny J. San rolls his tongue to the way he just shouts it out, it all rules. Don't Care 'Bout Nothin' tells what we all feel about school, and Dirt Talk is also awesome because it's got rhythm. The rest of the album is good, but mediocre compared to those three songs.Zinny was the man, it's too bad Shotgun Messiah got rid of him. The second album was also good, but Zinny would have been better than bassist Tim Skold taking his place."
2,Not up to it...,"I searched and searched, but couldn't find much in the required ""hooks"" that are needed for a good metal song that you want to hear over and over again. There is some good lead work, but it doesn't satisfy. Check out ""Second Coming"" for their best stuff."
2,rusted out,"I loved this item at first, and threw it in the dishwasher with other tools. After about 6 months, it no longer worked. I checked the mechanism, which was rusted and cracked. Either hand wash and thoroughly dry or skip this item."
4,What can you say about Tongs?,They work well and are a good size for bagels and pastries...I like the slide up lock better then the cheap-o metal ring around the last tongs we had for our Thursday morning office breakfast.
4,Good stuff.,I can't believe I've been cooking so long without one of these things. It makes things in the kitchen so much easier! It seems to be made well (good craftsmanship).
3,good pullup locking mechanism,Lodge brand sells the old design of locking tongs and I find that the locking ring always slips down and closes the tongs when I am using them. The Oxo brand is much better.
5,Extension of my hand,These are quite short but I prefer that since they do not feel as unwieldly as some I've used. Also the spring action doesn't feel like you're trying to hang on to it. I don't need a huge lobster claw protruding from my hand.The locking action is well set and it releases in a smooth motion with a tap on the counter.I especially appreciate the fact that the jaws line up with each other so I can grip food without struggling.
5,Good Grips,"The 12-inch OXO Good Grips are well made, easily stored, and useful in the kitchen and for the grill."
5,terrific tongs,"I had the longer version of these tongs, and used them so often that I needed another pair. I use them nearly every day; they are easy to use and do what I want them to."
4,Locking tongs,"Love these tongs, they stay ""together"" in the drawer!! Handy for many tasks other than salad serving. I recommend these."
5,Can't go wrong with these tongs,"They work great, clean up well and is very likely are most used tool in the kitchen."
1,Spring fails after 2 weeks use.,"When I received these tongs they looked fantastic. Looked like high quality stainless steel with good rubber grips. After two weeks, however, the tongs don't open up all the way anymore but instead gets stuck in the middle. I have to open the tongs up myself by my hands. It is now very inconvenient to use. I don't recommend this product."
4,Great Tongs!,"I usually buy OXO products for my kitchen use, I don't do a lot of cooking, mostly BBQing now.Strong durable and easy to clean/use.Maybe not totally durable, but it's good enough for a 4 star, I am rough on my items.I was able to bend a part on my tong."
1,OK while they last,"Worked great for a little over a year, then the spring that holds the tongs apart broke. If they won't spring open, they are pretty much useless. Can't expect anything better for something made in China."
2,not new; disappointing,"I ordered a pair of these tongs as a gift because I love the pair that I have. However, this item did not arrive in new condition. The product tag was stapled onto the tongs, suggesting that they had been returned. In addition, the tongs were held together with 1/2"" tape-- something that should have been unnecessary, given that the stem can be pulled out to keep the tongs in a closed position (which was not necessary for shipping). The item was clean, but seemed to have been used. Perhaps I was predisposed to see a problem once I saw the stapled tag and the tape around the tongs, but this was quite a disappointment."
5,Best Tongs I've Owned!,I love to cook and love these new tongs. I retired all my other tongs to the recycling center - these are the perfect size for just about any job.
5,Very good medium-length set of tongs,"A 12"" set of tongs like these cover 90% of your needs, unless you grill a lot, perhaps, or cook regularly with unusually large frying pans, braziers, or stockpots. I like the Oxo tongs quite a bit, which is saying a lot, as I don't think highly of the brand generally. These have a good feel to them, the rubber grip surface is effective for non-slip purposes as well as heat insulation, and the the locking mechanism makes it particularly easy to accommodate in kitchen drawers, the dishwasher, or a utensil pot. The ends have a useful bend to them that makes picking up food items easy. I wish the stainless were just a bit heavier-gauge, but in practice, I haven't had any bending problems.Again, good for 90% of normal kitchen needs. A longer set of tongs is probably a better choice for grilling, but even there, these are fine for the odd item or so."
4,Changing Rating,"I previously rated these a five but in a couple months use, the locking mechanism has broken."
5,Great tongs,"I use these all the time... in fact, I'm thinking about buying a second pair! Grip is comfortable, spring is at the right tension, and the length is just right."
5,I'm lost without my tongs!,"Tongs are the MOST useful tool in my kitchen. I use them to: stir fry, turn hot foods on the grill, hold meat while I slice it, etc. etc.The rubber handles put these tongs over the top. Get 'em greasy, get 'em wet, doesn't matter, they won't slip. Another bonus - where other tongs get too hot these are fine because the rubber stays cool. You can safely use these to fish things out from a pot of boiling water! Try that with a pair of all metal tongs... ouch!I also like the ability to lock them in the closed position. You will not regret buying these tongs."
5,Best one-handed tool ever,"Great balance and tension make these tongs a pleasure to use. I bought them for the grill, but use them for a million other things in the kitchen. I got a small taste of what arthritis sufferers must endure when I whacked my hand on something a couple weeks ago & bruised it badly. My grip strength was greatly reduced & it hurt to try to squeeze anything... this was the only tool in my kitchen that I could still use easily. The locking mechanism is sturdy, simple to operate, & makes storage easy too. Get 'em and you'll find that they move to the top of the ""always in the dishwasher"" list, because you'll use them that much!"
3,Great until...,"...the spring rusts. I own both the 12' (for normal indoor cooking) and the 16"" (for grilling). I have used both countless times. They grip food well and you feel as though you have a firm hold of the hood too. In all the times I have used them, I have discovered two main flaws. The first flaw is the flexibility (bend-ibility)of the ""hands"", the part of the tongs that actually touches the food. If you grasp the food too tight, they bend. This means the they will not close tight without bending them back into shape. The second is the metal used in the spring. This metal is prone to rust and when it rusts the tongs no longer have their normal spring and often get stuck. My advice would be to spend a little more money and get a hight quality."
3,"Okay, but harder to control","The spring is too weak, making these more difficult to control. The Weber 16"" tongs seem better and less expensive. This product is okay and does the job, but not great. Generally I really like Oxo products."
4,I Can't Review,This was part of a wedding gift set. I have not heard pro nor con about this item from the receiving couple.
1,eh?,"Maybe it's just me but things made in China just don't excite me very much in general, and these seemed awfully flimsy to boot. I returned them right away."
4,So far so good,"So far so good, the tongs have been strong and have proven to be good with the handle as far as using with the grip area. I would recommend them at this point"
3,OXO rubber doesn't hold up over time,I bought these about 18 months ago and I'm now replacing them. The metal part of the tongs is fine but the rubber is degrading and turning funky - simultaneously greasy and sticky to the touch. Don't know whether it's from the frequent heating and cooling or from frequent trips through the dishwasher. I've had the same thing happen with the rubber grips on other OXO tools.
4,It's good to get a grip,"If there is anything I really dislike, it's ""cheap made"" kitchen ware. That's why I use OXO items like these tongs. They grip well without having to squeeze hard, have a non slip gripping area that won't transfer heat if using in boiling water (they might if you left them sit in it a while, I don't know) I give it four stars because I don't like the locking mechanism. It extends up to lock the item closed for storage. Some may like it, I don't. I didn't allow that feature from allowing me from purchasing it though. Good tongs..."
1,CHEAP IMMATATION NOT OXO,"These are not the tongs that i ordered! The seller advertises this product to be oxo good grips, they are NOT!! First off they are not oxo, second the locking mechanism doesn't work, third they actually fell apart while I was working after less than 1 week of use! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Anyone without tongs, these are for you!","I don't know how I ever managed without my kitchen tongs... As an avid ""Food Network"" watcher, I slobber over all of the tools that they have at their disposal. However, I have limited funds and limited space and can't justify ""one-purpose"" tools. But truly, I couldn't do without these! I use them for everything from fish to fries to salads to burgers. The quality is great and the size is perfect!!!"
5,Great Tongs,"OXO makes great products, so it's no surprise that these tongs are great to work with. My old tongs lasted 20 years and I suspect these will last the next 20."
5,OXO Good Grips 16-inch,These are so nice. Wasn't sure if they would be too long at first but when I got them I found out quickly that they are perfect. My hands are sensitive to heat and these allow me to turn the meats etc. without having my hands directly over the heat. Grips are strong and sturdy and the strips on each side make it super comfy to hold. Like the little locking feature at the top.
2,weak spring,"I have OXO 12"" tongs and love them in the kitchen, so I ordered these 16"" ones for the outdoor grill. These 16"" tongs have a weak spring so that when you release them, they do not spring open like the 12"" ones do. You have to kind of use your fingers to pry them back to the open position, making them very annoying. I already threw away the packaging assuming I would like them otherwise I would definitely return. Buy 12"" instead and you will be happy."
5,Mel Torme Swings Shubert Alley review by Dale,"I hadn't ever had a collection of Mel Torme songs other than an old copy of Blue Moon, which I thought was a great classic crooned by Mel in a perfect rendition of that song. Something tipped me off to this album and I have to say after a few listens that jazz doesn't get any better than this. The instrumentation is great, the voice perfect, and the sound is the sort of thing you can play on the best stereos and enjoy every nuance in the music. I've been a long-time fan of Sinatra and Bennett, but growing up in the 1970's they were already a generation behind most everything I listened to, so I hadn't heard much other music like theirs. I shouldn't have waited so long. This music is fairly upbeat throughout, but never lightweight or trivial - just a great listen to a great singer with a superb jazz accompaniment. Highly recommended."
3,The locking mechanism broke,"Last Xmas (1999) I bought my wife two of these. The locking mechanism broke on the first one in January of 2000. The locking mechanism on the second one broke in mid 2000. From what I'm reading in the other reviews, this is a common happening.From that part of it, the thing probably deserves 1 star. However, the thing still works as a can openener, even though the lock broke. Taken strictly on the can opener part of it, it's got a nice grip - feels better than most can openers, but probably isn't worth the extra money.Overall, it's just ""OK"". If you like the rest of the Oxo line, you'll probably like this - although I bet your lock will break before too long, and it'll just be any other can opener then."
1,Zero stars wasn't an option,I thought this was a great gadget until it broke after I used it a month!The locking button broke so now I just have a big handled can opener.
2,Great until it breaks,The locking mechanism is plastic and eventually breaks (with light use mine broke in about 1 year) By then some of the teeth on the lower wheel (that holds the can while the upper wheel cuts) were worn and getting it to hold the can while it opened was tricky. Until about the last month it worked wonderfully. Too short lived to give it any higher a score.
4,Lock Still Works - Gears are Slipping,I have had this can opener for at least a year now and my lock is still intact. However after a year of frequent use I am now finding that the gears that actually latch onto the can are slipping off. Problem because I have to reattach the opener but it still works! I love the fact that it is ultra comfortable and much better than the one I had before. All I can say about the loch is be gentle it is only plastic.
2,"Nice, but needs work.","Like others, the lock on mine broke after just a couple months of use. But, I do find it the most comfortable, manual, can opener I have ever used."
4,Worth the hunt for this one!,"Easy to use this can opener! It is sharp, smooth and comfortable to hold. It fits on all sizes of cans. I hope it lasts a long, long time! (If it does I will give it the 5th star)"
1,You'll just have to send it back.,I bought it. I used it for a week. The little locking thing broke. I took it back. Not worth the trouble.
4,this is a good solid can opener,this is a no muss no fuss can opener that has a lock and works flawlessly. i am very happy with it...
2,Locking Can Opener,"I had purchased the same opener several years ago at a department store. I loved the locking mechanism. The opener was solid and held up great. Unfortunately, the handle snapped off in the middle of a chili batch during the opening of many cans of beans and tomatoes. I couldn't find one like it anywhere so I ordered it from Amazon since the shipping was free. I am extremely unimpressed with the quality of the new one. It is lighter in contruction and I can see why the chief complaint is the locking mechanism breaking. It's going to occur sooner than later. I wish I could remove the opener and put it on my old opener handle. Two stars for this looser.Update 10/5/11: Been using this opener for nearly a year now. Have to say, it's held up and I've gotten use to the ligher weight construction. I would 3 star this item if I had it to do over."
2,Loved it until it broke,"I have an OXO Chef's knife and love it, so I figured I'd stick with the OXO brand for this. It was inexpensive (I mean come on, do can openers need to be fancy?) but it did have nicer features than a standard metal one. Like other reviewers who were less-than-satisifed, mine broke about one year after purchasing. I could tell it wasn't working quite right because it wouldn't completely finish opening the lid, in other words there was still a tiny part of the lid that would remain attached to the can no matter how many times I went over it (and it's always fun to practically slice your finger open trying to retrieve the lid that has sunk down into the can and its contents). Then shortly after it just didn't even attach to the can at all. Maybe in this case, you do get what you pay for."
1,Buy the *other* Oxo can opener,"After briefly playing with this unit at a friend's kicthen I went to a local retailer to buy one, only to find they were out of it- so I bout the other, less futuristic looking Oxo can opener. As it turns out, I lucked out.My Oxo is still going strong after two years; it's the best hand can opener I've used. This model, though, has since been discarded by my friend. It works great for a few weeks, but then the plastic bits start to wear, and the locking mechanism starts to stick, and the user starts to swear.The idea for the lock was a good one- that seniors and others with limited hand strength could lock it on, using both hands if ncessary, and then concentrate on turning the knob. Unfortunately it doesn't work that way. The lock becomes more of an annoyance than a help, the handle isn't terribly comfortable, and ... well, it's just not a terribly good design.Oxo makes a lot of lovely products, so I suppose you can't fault them for the occasional turkey."
1,Does not live up to expectation,"I'm a big fan of OXO Good Grips products -- my peeler, ice cream scooper and wine opener have served me well. This can opener was my latest purchse, and it has not lived up to the OXO name. After a few uses the blade seemed to lose its sharpness. After probably less than 50 uses, the can opened failed to work complete (blade become misaligned, perhaps). Next time it's back to the Zyliss for me!"
2,"Lock broke, but it's still comfortable","I'm glad to know I'm not the only one with a busted lock -- lasted maybe 1-2 months. However, true to Oxo form, the handles are still much more comfortable than any other can opener I've used (thus, 2 stars instead of 1)."
2,More difficult than it's worth,This can opener doesn't work that well. It's difficult to get it to lock on properly and gets dislodged during cutting easily also. Buy something else.
3,"just ""okay""... maybe a little better now (read add-on)","My first Oxo can opener was great until, after about 3 years, part of the handle broke (the part that you turn to open the can). I got more than my money's worth out of it, so I bought another one. It is not as good as the older one was. The newer model pops off as I am opening the can, and I have to constantly reset the blade. It also does not open the can completely, leaving that tiny bit at the end that has to be twisted off -- not a big deal for some, but the original opener removed the entire lid, end to end. On the upside, it is comfortable to use.It took me a while to realize this, but...If you raise the back of the handle up while opening a can (so the opener is almost at a 45 deg. angle), the opener works much, much better. (The opener may already operate at that angle for most, but for those 5' and under, it was difficult to open a can unless you raise your arm higher.)I think I am going to lower my counters soon."
2,"Too ""jazzed-up""","I wanted a fairly straight rendition of Jerome Kern's beautiful songs, but this is not it."
5,A wonderful and valuable work,"We all need to walk before we can run -- and in ""First Words,"" some of the world's greatest literary sprinters take their first fumbling steps. They stretch their muscles, get their balance, totter and then take off -- and what strides they finally make!Rounding up these first words, Editor Paul Mandelbaum has performed an invaluable and remarkable feat of literary excavation. Who knew this stuff even existed? For anyone who loves to read, or loves to write, ""First Words"" is revealing, inspiring and - believe it or not - just plain fun."
5,This will be my lifes book.,"Hi my name is ... The title of this book is Matilda the author is Roald Dahl. The genre of this book is realistic fiction because it could have happened.The sittings of this book are at the public library and at school in 1988. What happens is that this little 4 year oldand 3 month old girl named Matilda. Does not have parents care for her.I like this book because in this story she shows respect to her olders and shows smartness. I would let any person over 6 years old.Something interesting is that she moves books, cables,and stuff like that. I mean as in she moves it with her eyepower. I mean we dont even have power to control stuff.If you want to check out this book look for the tittle Matilda the author of this book is Roald Dahl and this hasbeen Carmina Ortiz telling you about this story."
5,a great book for all ages,"Matilda is a superb book. Dahl uses his great humor and storytelling abilities to bring the reader into the world of a small girl. Matilda is an extremely intelligent, mischievous girl who must live with her corrupt and dull family. Using her incredible abilities she saves her school from a tyrant of a principle and finds her own niche. A delightful tale to relax and entertain."
1,It made no sense and was very strange.,"This book was terrible! There was no suspense at the end of the chapters, the ending came too quickly and made little sense, and the telepathic powers were inplausible and unbelieveable. Roald Dahl bombed this time"
5,The Amazing Girl,"Matilda is an amazing little girl. Her parents did not care much about her or what she did, and so they were oblivious to the fact that she was possibly the smartest little girl ever. They are always calling her dumb and other things. For the way that her little genius mind works, she comes up with many many ways of getting back at her parents. They never find out that it is her playing all of the tricks. She is actually never noticed until she goes to school and Miss Honey sees that Matilda is a genius. Just like at home there is a big mean woman, the head mistress, who is standing in the way of Matilda advancing. Matilda starts to plot ways to get rid of the Trunchbull, and with Miss Honeys help they may or may not be successful."
5,Insainly Jealous,"A born genious, Matilda, the smartest girl in the family. Her courageous moves and outstandingly funny childhood, makes you not want to put this book down. I couldn't believe the way she lived her life and the way she was treated by her parents. Even though, she knew how to deal with them and have a blast at the same time. She cracks me up, I couldn't stop laughing the whole way through the book. Excellent, I'd read it a hundred times!"
5,An exciting book,"This book is about a girl named Matilda that is really smart. Every morning at the age of four Matilda goes to the library and gets about 7-10 books. Her family does not pay attention to her. Miss Honey is Matilda's teacher. She thinks that Matilda should be put up to the sixth grade. Miss Trunchbull is the principal that is very mean. She picked up a little girl by her pig tails, and threw her over the fence into the garden and while she was flying in the air, she picked flowers for Miss Honey. Miss Honey loved them. But I don't want to tell you any more because if you get the book, you could hear her sweetness and poitenss and play in her adventures!"
5,"Matilda loves books,school, and even mischief.",Matilda is a very gifted child. She likes to go to the library and even reads adult books. Her parents are mean and would rather have her watch T.V than read. She finally gets to go to school and she has a nice teacher that helps her reaveal a special power within her. She also punishes her parents for all of their neglect in funny ways.
5,The book Matilda was really great!,I thought that this book was wonderful because it was really funny! I enjoyed whe Matilda played jokes on her parents.
5,SBW & LC's Review of Matilda - Perth Western Australia,I thought the book Matilda was pretty joy because it proves how horrible some teachers can be and Roald Dahl and Quinten Blake are pretty good writers and ilustrators.
4,A normal book for children,"This book Matilda is about a five and a half year old girl who is a genius. Matilda goes to a school where an evil headmistress is. She doesn't likes children and she treats them very hard. Only the class teacher Miss Honey of Matilda is nice and kindly to their children. The parents of Matilda doesn't interests in Matilda and in her especially talents. Often Matilda punish her parents a little bit, because they aren't nice to her. I have one sister and one brother and when they get on my nerves, I play sometimes practical tricks on them. This book is very detailed and I like the characters of the person, because they describe the persons very good. I can imagine how the persons look like."
5,Don't think about your age ! Read it !!!,"This is one of the most remarkable book I've ever read ! Matilda is a book reader. Amazingly bright and started to read at the age of 5. When she entered her school, she helped Miss Honey, her teacher to get back her propeties, wages and what not from her aunt, Ms. Trunchbull. You'll never believe it ! But, she has a magical power that helped her a lot with her mission. It's cover is kinda dull. But I can assure you that you'll love the contains. You'll probably read it over and over again like me !"
4,"Keeps the reader on his toes, hoping for more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Everyone, should, at one point or another, have read a Roald Dahl book.He weaves together creative stories, for all ages, and everyone enjoys them. Matilda is a girl who has special powers, but idiot, dishonest parents.If you liked this book, you should also read the Harry potter series, Tuck Everlasting, or, see the Matilda movie."
4,This This is a really good book about a girl that has powers,"The Book Matilda was a great book to read. It's about a little girl who's parents hate her and even hate looking at her. One day she got so mad at her parents that she started pulling pranks on them like dying her father's hair blond, putting super glue in her fathers hat so when he put it on it would stick to his head, and much more. She got so mad that she realized that she had powers. She could use those powers when she thought of times that someone yelled at her. With those powers she can move things juice and cereal. Mrs. Honey is her sweet teacher and Mrs. Trunchball is her mean principal. Everyone hated Mrs. Trunchball so Matilda pulls pranks on her. The end is great when they trick Mrs. Trunchball. You'll have to read to find out how they prank her. I give it **** because it's humorous, adventurous, and a fantasy. I love those thing in a story. If you want to read this book it is by Roald Dahl, and the title is Matilda."
4,Matilda,"I would highly recommend this to third to fifth graders. I thought it was good because there was a lot of detail and it had a really good problem. It's about a girl who's really smart and doesn't like her mean ol' parents that send her to a school with a horrible principal, but a nice teacher. The names are...Miss Trenchbell (principal), Miss Honey (teacher), Mr. and Mrs. Wormwood (Matilda's parents), and Matilda (main character). I liked this book especially because all the bad guys get what they deserve. Miss Trenchbell got it and Mr. and Mrs. Wormwood got some, but Matilda got a very happy ending and that's why I gave this book 4 stars."
5,A book which was fantastic.,"Matalida is a great book,i love the characters in it.Matilda is a little girl who is five,she has incredible powers,Miss Honey doesn't belive that she (Matilda)tipped the glass over on Mrs Trunch bull.In the middle of the book Matilda finds out that Miss Honey's mom is Mrs Trunchbull!At the end Matilda starts to like Miss Honey alot so,when her family was about to leave to a different country Maltilda said""Miss Honey!,""can you adupt me?Miss Honey adupted said""yes"" Matilda parents thought she was a total nerd.Matilda's family had no care for her,who would give their child to their child's teacher."
4,Sweet!,"Sweet & short.I really like the illustrations in it.The story was a bit short, I wish I could have a bit more from Matilda."
4,Praise for Matilda,"I would give four stars to Matilda by Roald Dahl. This book is a 4 star book because it was very interesting but not the best book I have read.Matilda is a genius child with idiotic parents who are very mean to her. They do not care about Matilda at all they think she is not intelligent and that they are. At school Matilda has to deal with Miss ""The"" Trunchbull, a very cruel and horrid headmistress with an attitude. The only comfort Matilda has is her teacher Miss Honey and they share a very big secret about Matilda. I very much like this book but as I said it is not my favorite book. I like books more like ""The Hunger Games"" and ""A Series Of Unfortunate Events"" Roald Dahl is a very gifted writer who has many other funny children's stories. Books I recommend by Roald Dahl: ""James And The Giant Peach "", ""Matilda"", ""The Twits"", ""The BFG"". My favorite part of this book was when Matilda put the super glue in her dad's hat."
4,Matilda by Roald Dahl,Matilda is a little girl that since she was little loved to read books. She went to the library alone since she was about 4 or 5 years old. Matilda's parents did not care about her because they thought she was a dumb girl that spended her time reading. Matilda did not get to go to school until she was about 6 because her dad did not like school. Matilda was ancies to go to school but when she got there she did not spected what she saw. There she met a nice teacher called Miss. Honey which was the only person that was nice to her.
5,Mrs.Brown's 4th grade class,"MatildaI think that this is a funny book. I think that this is a book that 4th and 5th graders might enjoy. One part that made me laugh was when Matilda used her power to write on the chalk board and wrote to the principal, ""Agatha, this is Magnas. It is Magnas And you'd better believe it!""Michael Wilson"
5,The Best And Witchiest Book Ever,AT first I thought the book was going to be boring. When it got to the part when she stuck the parrot in the chimney. Then the book got better. The book is mainly about M atilda and how her parents wouldn't let her read and the only thing she could do was watch television. Then her dad tore up the library book and he told her never to go to the library again.Her mother also goes to bingo everynight.My favorite part was when M atilda and her friend put a newt in the principals glass of water. Another one is when she tells the librarian how old she is and how the librarians reaction looked. THE ENDING OF THE BOOK WAS GOOD . she got switched to Miss Honeys house and from then on she lived with her. The end of the book was also very exciting. I think Matilda is a very good book so go to the library and check outy this book.
5,A grand book to stimulate a child's mind,If there were a word to describe it it would be perfect.A great book to add to your collectio
5,Meet Harry Potter's Predecessor -- Matilda,"It's only fair that this book be mentioned in comparison to the Harry Potter books, since this book is similar in tone, character, and sheer genius. In fact, MATILDA is probably the predecessor to Harry Potter, and deserving of as much praise and admiration.Matilda is a girl who doesn't jibe with her parents, is despised by the school principal, Ms. Trunchbowl, and has a wonderfully sweet teacher named Miss Honey. Oh, and Matilda just happens to have special powers. This book follows Matilda in her search for friendship, approval, and the key to her magical powers.The tone in this book is whimsical and magical, with a huge helping of humor and outrageousness. The characters are strong and entertaining, and the story is engaging. This book is a must read for fans of Roald Dahl's other books, specifically CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, as well as fans of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. Highly recommended!"
3,"A cute book, a Roald Dahl favorite!","This book is definitely a classic. In my opinion it is quite different from the movie, but it is still cute. This is one of those books that I probably wouldn't read again but it is still a book that's worth reading at least once."
5,Matilda is awesome by a 9 year old girl in 4th grade,I loved this book because I just kept wanting to read more and more.It was so cool. I love it! The movie is cool too. The book had some kind of magical force that tempted me to read it.The trunchbull is hilarious and scaryMatilda is kind and smartMiss honey is understanding and lovingLavender is courageous and coolMrs. Wormwood is nicer than Mr wormwoodMr wormwood is really mean.I was laughing out loud when the newt hopped into the glass.It's really sad that miss honey was poor.My favorite character is Matilda because if you just talked a conversation about anything other than mathematics or school she would seem like an average four year old.
4,Happy &reading,Great reading for kids and adults. Family fun during reading time. A fun and funny book with great emanation and story line.
5,Fantastically Wonderful,"I was first read this book in 2nd grade, when I was 7 yrs. old. I am 15 now and must have read it a dozen times or more(literally). And I'm still reading it! If you liked this book, I would reccommend The BFG (Big Friendly Giant). That is also awesome. The Twits is a good book to read for laughs(also by Roald Dahl)."
5,Matilda,"Matilda, a small book worm, is obsessed with books and loves to read .Her parents get very irritated with her because she is either reading or she is at the library getting books but when ever she comes home from the library she reads for hours at a time.She meets her dream friend and really likes her a lot and then it turns out that she is her kindergarten teacher[for the afternoon anyway] then she has a very mean teacher for the morning so she looks forward to the afternoon so she can see her friend ,Ms.Honey , her other teacher the morning was Ms.Trunchbull she was the one that she didn't like ,well she likes her but she is mean to her she throws her and yells at her.I thought this book would help anyone that needs to learn to deal with rude people that boss you around that you dont want to .I would recomend this book to any one that likes to read for a long time and has a good imagination and loves just a little action in the book."
3,good book,"""Matilda"" by Roald Dahl is about a little girl called Matilda who is a genius and has got many problems with her parents because they are not intersted in her. Furthermore Matilda meets her monster-like headmistress, who hates small pupils and a very nice and kind class-teacher Miss Honey, who is the only one who encourages her talents.I think the children's book ""Matilda"" is very well written because it is easy to read but I also think that the story is a bit unrealistic."
1,I LOVE THIS BOOK,"READ THISI gave it one star because i wanted to get your attention cos i just got to tell you that this book is great ,pay no attention to the people who have rated it one star they are totally wrong , i totally recomed this book, its good for 9 and under its a totally cute book it has fantasy humor and all that kind of stuff , one of My favorite parts was when she lernt how to read when she was only"
2,Not what I expected,"I guess it depends on what you are looking for in a book. If your child is a Matilda fan she will probably love the book. This was purchased as part of my granddaughters' school reading list. Fortunately, she switched schools and did not have to complete the book.Although she loves to read she had zero interest in the book.Generally speaking the book is well written and intriguing unless of course you are trying to teach your child values (which my granddaughter's parents are). I suspect the school selected the book based on the popularity of the character and not for any other intrinsic usefulness. I would have preferred another book for my 6 year old granddaughter.We do have the movie, it is not one of her favorites nor mine."
3,Erm...t'is ok,"I read half of it, and didnt care for it too much. I saw the movie a long time ago and have been wanting to read it but was dissapointed. i only got to the chapter called ""Lavender"" then stopped becos i had to go on vacation and return the book. IMO, i think the movie with Danny Devito as Mr. Wormwood is WAY better. more entertaining and funny and cute. The book was just too childish and farfetched compared to the movie. Hmm, i'm twisted. Ok. there's my 1 cent."
2,I didn't like this book,"Matilda is a five year old girl who has parents who don't know her intelligence. Matilda has gone to the library since she was four years old. She read all the childen's books in the library. When Matilda started, she was five years old.Miss Honey is her teacher.When Matilda started school, she learned about the Trunchbull. She learned that the Trunchbull picks kids up and throws them out the window. She puts them in the chokey. The chokey has nails and glass pointing out of the walls.Matilda scares away the Trunchbull by tipping water over with a newt in the drinking water.She also practiced picking chalk and writing messages on the board from Miss Honeys Dad.Somebody might want to read this book because it's exciting and intelligent, but I didn't like it."
5,Very good!!,"Ever since the day i read this book, and saw the movie i was just completely swepped away by the way Matilda had been treated. It is really good for girls who dont rele like to read.... i no because that was me in the 4th grade! :) I love the way the character miss honey is potrayed.... I've always wanted to have a miss honey figure in my life. It's just an amazing story and it should be shared with everyone!"
5,Matilda,This was a great book. After i read it i decided to do it for my school book report. I think this is a great book to do a book report for school because its easy to read and its just a great book.I think the kids that read this book get smart.I love this book and Ryan Thomas(this kid from bellefonte thats really hot!!)
5,She can move things with her mind!,Matildas parents don't pay enny attention her.She finds out she hasspishd prows.Miss Trunchbull is the mean principal that every one whtsto get rid of. Miss Honey and Matilda work together toget rid of theprincipal.Matilda worght on the bord like Magnus.I think you will likethis book because it is really really good.The character is realistic.Thereis some action in this book.Miss Trunchbull is Miss Honeys aunt.
5,The Movie and It are Great!,"This is a fantastic book! I really think you should get it! It's hard to decide which is better though,the book or the movie."
3,Excellent! 3 stars is a LOT for me!,"This book was great! It was very fun. And I want to say I hate people who say this book was for 3rd graders, because it was not."
3,IT'S OK.....I GUESS,"I D0N'T KNOW. THIS BOOK IS A LITTLE SHAKY. I THINK ROALD DAUL GAVE THIS BOOK SOME BORING DETAILS AND OTHER ""BORING THINGS"". BUT I GUESS YOU CAN LIKE IT. EVERYONE ELSE IN MY CLASS LIKED IT SO THAT'S JUST MY OPINION. JUST READ IT AND SEE HOW YOU WILL RATE IT!!"
2,A nice but too unrealistic book,"Matilda is an extra ordinary child, who loves reading and learning. She's a lot cleverer than the other children but her parents are so silly that they don't care at all about her.The idea of the story isn't bad but unbelievable : we can't believe that parents can be so mean, we can't believe a headmistress throws her pupils like a hammer ...The beginning of the book is very funny and interresting. But it rapidly becomes boring and we aren't surprised anymore.It must be a good book when you're about 7 or 8 because it's quite easy to read and understand.But it's too unrealistic. Everything seems to be black or white :on the first hand there are Miss Trunchbull and Matilda's parents who are silly and cruel and the other hand there are Matilda and Miss Honey who represent brightness and kindness.But it's still a nice book ...But it's just the advice of a French girl who has read this book in English ..."
2,Matilda,"You might think that this is a bad rating but come on! Don't you think a 5-year-old getting super brain powers is a little cliché? Anyway, I would recommend this book for anyone who likes Roald Dahl books. It's a story of a girl named Matilda who has parents that treat her like dirt and a headmistress who, well lets just say if life were like Star Wars than she would be Darth Vader. From hats glued to somebody's haed too a parrot up a chimny this is a must read book for any Roald Dahl fan!"
3,Magical Mischief With Matilda,I read the book Matilda. It`s about a six year old girl who lives with her mean bossy parents. Her dad sells old broken cars and her mom plays bingo during the week. She finds out she has powers to move things with her eyes. She uses them to defeat her mean principal Miss Trunchbull who will do anything to get rid of kids. I liked the book because it is about a girl with strong powers. I like Miss Trunchbull because she tortures kids if they can`t do something right. I hope you read and enjoy this book by Roald Dahl.
4,A FUN AND EXCITING MUST READ!,"In our English class we all picked a book to read, write a letter to the author, and put a review online. My book selection was Matilda. This exciting book is a wonderful story about a young girl with a great passion to read. Although she is so tiny she won't let the Trunchbull stand in her way of learning. My favorite part is when Matilda gets put in ""the choky,"" because although she is so tiny she is so strong. Her parents may think school is stupid, but with Miss Honey's help Matilda will go great places. This book is so much better than the movie. How far would you go to prove your point?"
4,Whimsy on Paper,"This is a fantastical book that I thought I would dislike at first, but wound up falling in love with. It centers around a girl of genius intellect named Matilda who pulls pranks on her dimwitted parents, who are too blind to take notice of her multiple skills and criticize her passion for reading, as punishment for disrespecting her. After she commences schooling, she meets a loving teacher and a strict, abusive headmistress named Miss Trunchbull, who is revealed to be her teacher's aunt and had wreaked havoc for her during her childhood. After discovering that she possesses telekinetic abilities, Matilda decides to use this against the headmistress and assist her teacher in this entertaining, magical book that I definitely recommend to you right now. Buy this immediately, because you definitely will adore it."
5,"Outrageous Adults, One Genius Kid and a little magic!","This delightful tale, about an extraordinary girl named Matilda who lives with her dreadful parents, was also made into a movie in 1996. Children love the absolute meanness of the adults in the book, and Matilda?s unique solution to her wretched life. Mr. Dahl, author of Charlie and the Chocolate factory and James and the Giant Peach, balances the ludicrous behavior of the adults in his book with the sweet natured child who has reached her limit.My children loved it -- an absolute keeper!"
5,Very exciting and fall off your chair kind of book,I enjoyed the book so much that I have read it 4 times and every time I loved it. I love all of Roald Dahl books and this is my favorite.
5,This was an amazing book!!!,"I reccomend young children to read this book to help them on there skills.I give two thumbs up to this book,and I give a special thank's to Roald Dahl for helping children read."
4,The best of his later years,"This is a typically entertaining Dahl story, notable for having a female protagonist. It's not his tightest work; I think this one is padded with a few too many irrelevant mischievous incidents, but for the most part it's good fun, and parts are hilarious."
4,Matilda,"matilda is a great book for the young audience. i loved this book. it was very funny and witty. matilda was a wonderful character, and showed that someone always has a special talent. this book was a very well written book, and i would recommend it to anyone. i would also recommend other books by Roald Dahl."
4,Wish this was a brand new album,"Back many moons ago (when the video age was new) Muchmusic (the Canadian version of MTV) had preview weekend to temp people to expand from basic cable to cable plus. During one of these weekends I saw Nemesis followed by Wall of Vodoo's ""Far Side of Crazy"".I was hooked.Since then I've enjoyed each new release. The only reason I've rated this a 4 rather than 5 is that it is old matterial - the B sides of singles and alternative versions of some of their other songs. Naked Apes and Pond Life (included free with this CD) was the last new CD they released. Any collector will love this CD, and because NAaPL is included it serves as an introduction to thier work."
5,"Classic, unadulterated Shriekback","Just the first track, Tiny Birds, makes this a must-have for any Shriekback afficianado. And this ""limited edition"" comes with a bonus CD that definitely makes it worth the price (I don't want to spoil the surprise, but I will say it's an entire extra album)."
1,This Sucked!,"this was one of the WORST anime's ever!!!! i cant believe how much this was boring! i did watch the whole thing, and there was only one cool part. everything else made no sense. who are the blade children??!?!?!?!!? they never answered that dang question!!!-the end"
3,OK Anime but disappointing and confusing ending,I got this collection a couple of weeks ago all I can really say about this series is that for the most part it seemed like the main character Ayumu was playing detective to much in each episode most of them either trying to help the Blade Children 'The Main Mystery Of The Series' or trade wits with the Blade children through out the story you try to see the real reason for the threat to the blade children and why Ayumu's older brother sought to understand the Blade Children mystery the series is decent but with a confusing and open ending that never answers any of the questions you wanted to know it never even answers the mystery of the blade children much the voice actors again are great from Funimation Films but I'm sad to say the series itself is sadly lacking any true greatness
3,"Great, yet disappointing","To anyone that takes interest in mind games, this series sucks you in and you just can't let go. The art is fantastic, the dubbing was great, and it's really fun to watch and follow the storyline as trap after trap is set up for Ayumu.However, there is no resolution. All the questions that are asked never get answered, which in my opinion makes it drop a star (or two). Since there was no resolution, no continuation, or anything at all, it made me really disappointed. By the end, I really wanted to know, What happened to Kiyotaka? What in the fraking world are the Blade Children? Where did they come from? Why did the Hunters hate them?But none of this gets answered, none of it. Which is totally disappointing."
1,Didn't Fit,"Thought this would fit my 528 air filter and it didn't. Total waste of money for me, should have stuck with the dealership."
5,Mann Cabin Filters,Filters were a perfect fit in my 2002 525i BMW. They arrived quickly and the price was excellent for two filters.
3,Not a great fit,"As others stated this product has been changed and no longer uses a plastic frame. I don't understand why they can't make a filter that properly fits the existing plastic frame.These filters DO NOT fit well in my 1998 528i sedan. The filter is slightly (1mm?) too wide and the sides bunch up, so there are little areas on the side where the filter will be bypassed. Probably better than the old filters that were there 1+ year. I won't bother to return, but I will not buy this Mann filter again even if the alternatives cost more."
3,"Good filter, fit not so great (E39)","As others stated this product no longer comes with the black plastic frame. This change should be called out in the product description.These filters fit imperfectly in my 2003 530isedan. They are a little too big meaning the sides bunch up, so as another gentleman here said, ""there are little areas on the side where the filter will be bypassed."" This bugs me because I have always been a fan of Mann filters and used them on my Volvos and VWs. This is the first time I've been somewhat disappointed in the brand."
4,Wail Moody Wail,"Fine straight-ahead circa 1955 jazz from a very talented group. Worth buying just for the anti-R&R liner notes of Irving Gitler. My, how the world has changed. This CD contains 2 more tunes that the original mono LP. The band shows fine blues blowing on several cuts including a 10-minute Wail Moody showcasing Moody on tenor and alto and Dave Burns on trumpet, and is fine on standards such as The Nearness of You and Quincy Jones' The Golden Touch."
1,The Spewers,"This is not a movie; it is a rant. This is not a family; it is a cabal. There are no people in this movie; there are only predators. There is no dialogue here; there is only bile.Less watchable than pornography (which at least may have attractive flesh) or gore (which may at least have clever invention), this is just undammed hatred."
2,"Leaks soap, fell apart after 6 months","Soap comes out when you press the button at the top. It also comes out on its own, without any human intervention. This means filling it more often, plus wasted soap.This brush offers bristle replacement, which is a neat feature. I was considering replacing the bristles when the brush fell apart completely. It wasn't dropped or misused. I think the brush just isn't very durable.I wouldn't buy this brush again."
3,Ehhh Ok,"I got this to try since I am a huge fan of OXO Products. Maybe I am just being ""dumb"" but when I screwed off the top there was a small hole to put in my favorite liquid detergent and it made a huge mess. When I am scrubbing dishes that can't go in the dishwasher the brissels are not that strong. Even when I don't push the top liquid detergent still comes out which means I can't use the brush throughout the time I am cleaning otherwise there will always be soap. Also, there is no ""center spike"" to help remove ""caked on"" grease like other brushes I have used in the past. I would highly recommend the Libman Kitchen Brush [Curved] with small handle which is the one I will continue to use."
5,Makes a Great Gift for a Roommate.,"A nice passive aggressive way to say, ""hey dinkleface, get your mac and cheese encrusted pot out of the sink."""
2,Not too bad,"I bought that item after having read the reviews, most of them where positive, but I'm dissapointed by it.It's hard to get the soap out of there. I have to push hard and a few times before the soap is coming a little bit out. It's easy to clean plates, pots and pans. As I use only non stick pans, it's perfect cause it doesn't scratch them. Forget cleaning glasses,cups or even flatware with it."
2,Leaks! Not convenient,"I had this for about two weeks. It leaked dishsoap everywhere, and I didn't find it helpful for washing at all. I guess I'm a sponge girl."
3,so so,The bristles are too soft to get stuck food off. Trying to find again the one I used to get with stiffer bristles...Comfortable in the hand though.
1,Came defective.,"This came as part of a multi-item order. The box was mangled (rare event), but the scrub brush was the only thing affected. The bristles fell off and would not stay on, no matter what I did. I don't want to pay to return such a small item, but was disappointed. Amazon is usually so reliable. I bought anther brand which works perfectly."
3,Maybe not so great...,Bought this and initially loved it despite the fact that occasionally the top would loosen and dishsoap would leak out. Then I felt the bristles were a bit soft for tough scrubbing jobs (baked on brownie/burned casserole/lasagna pan/etc). DON'T make the mistake I did of using on hot pan which then melted the bristles to laying flat instead of vertical. After that the thing was useless... they need to make one with HEATPROOF bristles so you can scrub away while pot is hot. Will probably not replace with the same item.
5,I love this little scrubber!!,"I love all of Oxo products and this little dish scrubber does not disappoint. It is really sturdy and holds the dish soap in without it leaking. It looks much nicer than a sponge or long dish brush and holds up really well. It also fits really well in your hand and feels comfortable while you are using it. I have been using it for over 6 months now and it is still in great shape, would highly recommend!"
4,Good Scrubber,"I bought this hoping it would save my nails when washing certain items that needed harder scrubbing than a dishcloth can do. It fits in my hand easily and does the exact job I need it to do. I saw some staining on the bristles from tomato sauce left in pan but luckily it washed/rinsed out by the time I was finished with those dishes. It is easy to fill with soap but unless I am really mindful how hard I squeeze the top - I feel like too much soap can be dispensed. All in all, I am happy with this item."
4,Extremely Handy!,"We love Oxo prducts, however sometimes the price doesn't equal the performance. That isn't the case with this product. It is great. It keeps your hands fairly free of soap, and scum, it a space saver, and it's saves money (no need to buy brillo pads. Nice little gift too!"
4,Comfy Jeans,"I've bought these before, through JC Penney, so I knew they were going to be what I wanted. The fabric is thinner than other jeans so they don't wear real well but even for a skinny guy, the relaxed fit is very comfortable. Like other clothing I buy, the advertised measurements (30W x 30L) seem pretty approximate, erring on the big side. I guess that's in keeping with our ""expanding"" population. I will buy these in the future."
5,Always a great fit!,"Bought these for my son. He loves the fit. I buy them wherever I find them on sale, which is sometimes in stores. The ones in the stores have never run as much during the first washing as these did, so make sure you are washing only darks with these. Happy with my purchase!"
4,Excellent pocket sizes and fit,"I purchased these just before a long trip. Unfortunately, the first time I pulled them down, the fabric tore near the zipper and made them unwearable. I'm sure this was just an unusual weak point in the fabric. The fabric isn't as heavy as other brands of jeans. This keeps them from getting 5 stars. There are certainly times where lighter fabric is desirable, but I wouldn't wear them for actual carpenter work.For casual wear as pants, they are great. I carry all sorts of things in my pockets. The thigh pockets on the right leg are large enough for today's smart phones - which is awesome. It's my preferred place to carry my phone and so often carpenter pants or cargo pants don't make those pockets big enough.The rest of the pockets are a generous size as well.Good fit, even if a little bit vanity-sized."
3,"Good fit, little extra size...","Bought a pair in April, little extra room so fits well, but now in August they are worn out, holes by the pockets and belt loops, might have to pay more for some Levi's."
2,These are weak!,"I have returned these for a new pair too many times. Belt loops pulling off, wear holes in the legs, everything happened within a couple weeks of receipt. My last pair is being returned, and I will NOT be getting a replacement"
4,"Almost 1000 business ideas, that's almost 1 penny each!",You can't beat the price of this book! It is jam-packed with business ideas 999 of them! Anyone can find a few that they might be interested in starting!http://www.NationalBookSales.com
3,Endearing characters,"Kat Martin's latest Regency is a wowing crowd-pleaser with hot sensuous passion and archetypal brooding romance heroes. It is a romance at heart with ingenue Vermillian Lee Durant following the footsteps of her aunt Gabriella to become a cyprian well-craft in the arts of seduction. British cavalry Captain Caleb Tanner sneaks inside her manor as a groom to ferret out a treasonous spy and suspects Lee and her aunt. Smoldering passion soon complicates Caleb's investigation and leads him to believe Lee's innocence. The identity of the culprit abruptly comes out as a hasty denouement - disappointingly so when Ms. Martin painstakingly whips up paranoia in the mystery. Secret Ways thus establishes itself primarily as a sweeping romance, unfurling with Ms. Martin's magic in creating endearing characters with heart and affection."
2,Boring,"I usually read a book this size in two days max. It's been three weeks now, and I still have a way to go. I keep stalling because the plot keeps repeating: sexy spyman lusts after girl and is determined to have her, girl develops hots for sexy spyman and wonders if... Repeat cycle ad nauseum. Add lazy writing (he ""went painfully hard"" over and over again), nothing inspiring at all in the words, flat stereotype characters, and, well, boring."
3,slow starter,"I typically enjoy all of Kat Martin's books, but man this is the first I almost gave up on. Usually her books hook me within the first few chapters, but this one didn't happen for me until about halfway. I'm not a horse person, so the whole horse stable thing did not grab me in the least. I just about gave up, and finally... and boy do I mean FINALLY, did the book pick up speed. I was so close to just sticking the book on the shelf. I read books very fast. This one normally would take me less than a day, but I nursed this book for over a week. I even put it down to pick up a different book and finished that before returning to it. If you want a good Kat Martin book, get Fanning the Flame or The Dream or just about any other. I've just started Devil's Prize and it already has me. Wished I picked that one up first."
2,Not her best,"I've read just about all of Kat Martin's historical novels and have enjoyed most of them. This is the exception. From the start I found the storyline and love story between Vermillion (Lee) and Caleb boring. Nothing caught my interest and I found myself disliking the characters. One thing I must say is I get tired of stories where the man thinks the woman is *unpure* and treats her bad as a result. I want a love story, not a story where the characters beat eachother up verbally."
1,Secret Way to save money--don't buy this book,"This book is godawful. I've read--and liked--a lot of Kat Martin's work but not this one. It is the pits. The number of mistakes in it (like Vermillion going to Tattersall's) is unforgivable. Understandable, of course, when one realizes she's churning these out every couple of months. But then she ought to be able to hire someone to do her research."
4,Bought this for James Purefoy in Getaway,"I'm not really into Texas music overall, but it's a good CD. The video is fabulous! Mr. Purefoy is luscious and it was worth the money just for that! Woof!"
5,Something new and different.,This was a new item. Tasty pancakes. Need to try corn bread with black eyed peas or buttermilk a great new experience.
4,Very enjoyable,"This was the last small-group session Nelson did for Prestige (August 1961); his next and last album for the label was AFRO-AMERICAN SKETCHES, a big band outing. Nelson is joined by Joe Newman on trumpet, a major addition to any recording date, and two-thirds of a new rhythm section: Hank Jones replaces Richard Wyands on piano and Charlie Persip takes over from Roy Haynes on drums. The music really swings on this CD; only one of the six tunes is taken slow. Everyone is in a very relaxed mode, and the music is as pleasing and pleasurable as a summer's drive with the top down. J&B and TANGERINE falter a bit, but all in all the quality of the music on this CD is high."
1,I disagree with all of the other reviews...,"First let me just say that I consider myself the #1 fan of ( ). OK now that that's outta the way... I was very disappointed in this DVD. The CD was pretty cool, and that's what the one star is for, but the music videos on the DVD were terrible. When I listen to Sigur Ros I picture abstract and eretheral things, like weird or peaceful landscapes or romantic stories - not dancing down-syndrome people dressed as angels, and not children playing soccer (football). I wasn't really offended by the scene with the two boys, but I didn't really feel too good about it either. A music video should reflect what the director feels when he/she listens to the music. I didn't see any connection between these images and the genius music of Sigur Ros (except that the videos were in permanent slo-mo). Do yourself a favor and don't get it - or do Sigur Ros a favor and get it. Up to you."
2,Fair,"Not what we thought we were ordering. It was an okay play, but not that great. We could not get through the entire play."
2,Aunt Bam's Place,"Tyler Perry's Aunt Bam's Place was okay to me. A bit too deep and not as funny as his other plays! I have nothing against deep and meaningful messages, but I love to have my laughs with Tyler Perry's plays, and this one wasnt as fuuny!"
2,aunt bam's,"The quality of the dvd was excellent, but that was not one of tyler's best works. The movie wasn't as funny as some of his other movies or plays."
2,No No and No.,Ok. I never cared too much for Aunt Bam simply because she is soo freakin loud! All the time! Trying too darn hard to be funny! I decided to be more open minded but that was an epic FAIL. I don't know if I am just outgrowing stage plays but I am pretty sure it's the character Aunt Bam throwing me off with her loudness. Not all black aunts are loud and obnoxious. Bring it down a couple notches.
4,For all Tyler Perry fans,"Not one of Tyler's best. But, still hilarious and one to have to the collection. Cassie Davis is funny as expected and the rest of the cast expose great talent."
1,Lousy Listing,THis product was listed as a different movie and we never watched it. It was listed incorrectly and we should not have been charged for it. We are Tyler Perry fans and we watched another Tyler Perry movie instead. we would appreciate some way to get the money back that we were charged for a movie that we didn't want or watch.
3,Funny but...,"I love Tyler Perry, I own all his plays and movies. I really like Cassi Davis (Aunt Bam) she is halarious. Great story line but it seemed rushed. It seemed everything happened so quickly I didn't get an understanding of what was really going on, then it was over. I will watch it again and again I am sure but it will not make my list of Tyler Perry favorites."
2,Message is Great but.....,"This is not one of Tyler Perry's better plays. Although the message in the play is awesome, the total play itself is rather boring, it really needed an appearance by Madea. Aunt Bam is funny, but not funny enough to handle the entire play by herself. If I had saw this play from someone buying it first then I wouldn't have purchased it myself. If you are a parent and trying to send a message to your young teen about drugs, then this is a great teacher play but as far as entertainment, there are funny parts but overall you'll be rather disappointed. Sorry Tyler."
5,Very funny,"I love this DVD, it arrived in a timely manner and I enjoy Cassie Davis. No problems with the shipper and the price was lo. I would recommend this product. If you love Tyler Perry - you would love to add this play to your collection"
1,Terrible,"One of the worst plays i've ever seen. The story line was weak, as well as the punch lines. Honestly couldn't wait for it to end."
2,According to me....,"According to me, seeing how aunt Bam was in Madea's big happy family (the play), absolutely hilarious, this play wasn't even near it. I really expected a lot more."
5,Gets a little darker than the rest,"I thought this play was really good. I was caught off guard by the intensity of the storyline because Tyler has never taken me there before, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. There are a few laughs, but like I said the storyline is a lot more intense, so there was only so much comedy you could fit into the dialogue. If you enjoy intense stories that deliver a STRONG message then you will probably like it, but if you're expecting the comedy that Aunt Bam and Madea are known for, then you may not like it as much because the STORYLINE overshadows the comedy. In this case I can see why there wasnt AS much comedy, but like I said there were a few laughs that were needed to lighten the mood."
1,I just didn't like it at all.,"I love Tyler Perry's plays and movies, but this one was not good at all. I didn't even look at the entire play and I bought it! This play just wasn't good. I still love Tyler Perry I support him to the fullest. I have purchased every play and movie he has done and will continue to do so!! I just didn't like this one."
2,WTH!!!!!!!!! Awful,"Don't get me wrong this play had a great message, but that was not enough for the amount the DVD cost.. Tyler really dropped the ball on this one.. It was beyond dry, a waste of time, & money. Don't buy this DVD just borrow..."
5,Aunt Bam,I bought this DVD to see if I would love her more by herself and it was a great play with alot of meaning everyone should own this PLAY. You go Aunt Bam smooches.
1,Horrible,"SAVE YOUR MONEY THIS IS THE WORST PLAY TYLER HAS PUT OUT, MAYBE HE IS TRYING TO DO TOO MANY THINGS AT ONE TIME. NEVERTHELESS THE MUSIC WAS GREAT, DON't waste your money on this one, very disappointed"
2,Poor,"I love Aunt Bam but this play is not cutting it. Horrible. Really, I say don't bother purchasing it. It's missing a lot. Each new actor/actress gets a shouting scene, in singing. The rest is just dry."
3,ok,Not much to say. It was okay. Not as good as his others. Wish I could rate without writing a review but guess not.
5,Tyler Perry,Tyler Perry as always delievered another Stellar Play. Well worh the price. I highly recommend this play for all DieHard Tyler Perry Fans.
5,Fantastic work,This is a fantastic show exposing all the odds that are usually not talked about in our communities. It's educative to all ages. I am impressed!
1,Horrible,"Out of all of Tyler Perry's movies, this one was a mess, and on top of that, I thought it was a movie not a play. Wanting a refund!"
3,decent,"Didn't really like it too much it was funny not much plot or story line, less singing for this one more jokes and situations."
3,good,"great show. like it. good, fun. funny. awesome. woman main character. tyler perry makes great movies and plays. bravo to him."
1,Not Good!,"Most times people will go to movies and plays to get away from life's situations or drama's, (not to be reminded of the troubles constantly facing them each and every day). Maybe Tyler Perry was trying to deliver a message, but I think this message would have come across a little better in a movie vs. a play. That way when it is presented as a movie you will also get the rating, therefore you kinda know what to expect. I didn't think this play was funny at all, and I hope Tyler Perry wasn't trying to convey a christian message, because these days in Tyler's plays and/or movies there is no more christian values present. He said that he would not let Hollywood change him. What happened?"
2,aunt bam's place,This movie was scary and I did not like it. Do better on this because it was not the best
2,"Ok, But Aunt Bam Could Have Been A Lot Funnier","What can I say about Aunt Bam's Place, like all of Tyler Perry's movie they have a great message. Aunt Bam could have been a lot funnier, maybe she needed her sidekick my girl Hattie to help her out with the laughs."
5,Its Worth the Buzz,"If someone told me I would spend $500+ on a stroller I would say never. But after a visit to Land of Nod, read lots of review online my husband and I decided to splurge on the Quinny Buzz Stroller for our first and only child. It was the trip to Land of Nod that triggered me to consider this stroller. If you live in a walking city, like Chicago, it is one of the best strollers; it is excellent on the sidewalks, great for jogging, light weight, handling with one hand. The stroller comes with ALL the accessories, unlike most strollers. Our daughter enjoys the comfort of the Quinny Buzz; it is her little hybrid car. If you live in a city where you do lots of walking or strolling I would highly recommend this stroller. Also, it is good through toddler; so it is ONE stroller for ALL age."
5,Great product .,Strong suction . It can pick up all the sawdust and needle-shaped sawsplinter on the rough carpet after I sawed a board. It work well from beginning untill before finishing the charge .It keep sucking good for long time . A cordless vac worth the money paid for it .
1,Broke after the first use,"With all the crumbs from children, dog hair and my hair, I really needed a heavy duty vacuum, but after a few passes on my stairs it completely died. I tried cleaning it out, nothing was stuck it just burned out. Now when I turn it on it makes this horrible grinding sound and is useless."
2,want one? I'm giving mine away,I tried to research before replacing our old B&D dustbuster and ended up with the Shark. I can't even get the stairs vacuumed (just the tight spots) with enough power to actually suck. Doesn't seem to charge fully. I'm giving it up and going back to Black and Decker and crossing my fingers.
5,High Quality,"I can't believe I am writing a squeegee review, but I guess if one is sorting out competing squeegees, it would be nice to hear from other squeegee users. So I am happy to let you know this is a very good quality item. It feels hefty and ""well constructed"" in the hands, and it appears it will last a long time. The ergonomic design is not too bad either. Thumbs up."
2,Warped - not usable,I have an old squeege identical to this one. The old one has worked great for many years. The new one was returned because it was so warped it would not work. It was shipped to Florida during the summer and MAY have had heat damage during shipping. I continue to use the old one...
4,Hang on non-porous surface,"We like this squeegee, but learned the hard way not to hang it on the tile of the shower wall. Every other morning it was on the floor. Now that we have it on the glass, no problems. Works well."
1,"Too Firm, too obstructive.","There may be some situation where this product may work well, but in a shower it does not. The handle is so curved that it obstructs contact with the glass. The rubber part of the squeegee is also very firm which doesn't allow full contact with the glass. I wouldn't recommend."
4,"Works Well, but Not for Every Shower - Could Use Replacable Blade","The low cost, the size of the blade, and the comfortable handle make this a good buy. And the suction cup hanger is functional, simple, and satisfying. The down side is using it on a shower and tub with curves. I've found that the curves have warped or bent the ends of the rubber blade. This makes it harder to squeegee and it happened only after a few days of use. The product is still functional, but less so now. This might be a problem for all similar squeegees. Another down side is that someday this thing will most likley end up in a landfill. In hind site, I wish that I had sought out a product that had a greater chance of being recycled or biodegrading. While in many cases a squeegee seems to be less expensive and wasteful alternative to shower sprays, more need to be designed with a functional replaceable blade, which this product does not have."
3,Better than Spiker - More Legal than Sideout,"Rent it. It's forgettable as it follows the same idea as Sideout. Former star college basketball player decides to try volleyball and makes the finals on the AVP tour after one month of training and a little beach romance. I liked it better than I thought I would after reading about it in DIG Magazine. It's a good looking movie but sports movies often fall flat on being believable including stiff cameos from star athletes. Unrealistic game play at times. A scene outside a store with a bunch of TVs in the window forecasting the doom of the AVP's hot rookie seemed like an event from another era. What store still has TVs in the front window? Also, if you've ever wondered what happened to Jaleel ""Steve Urkel"" White, he manages the team. Any homage to Sideout made this much less original."
1,Only if you're a beach volleyball fan...,"It's okay to watch and appreciate this movie if you're a beach volleyball fan, otherwise, you'll have no clue as to what's going on. Very interesting story about beach volleyball players though."
4,surprisingly watchable.,"The movie isn't going to win an Oscar, but it's got heart... and lots of Vollyball. That was enough for me.Kristin Cavallari isn't hard to look at either."
5,Phenomenal,"What more can be said? This is Marvin Gaye! I love this CD. There,s something about the music of Marvin that just propels you into another demension. You don,t even need a significant other to fully enjoy this CD. Listening to this CD takes me back to my high school years. You are automatically taken back to a time when Love was new and intriguing. It completly warms the heart and soul. Even If you are not a fan of the R&B genre,This one will grab you by the ears and suck you right into your own world of total eargasm."
2,"N/A, CD does not play","Gave this as a gift ann the CD does not play on a brand new notebook with CD/DVD player using Windows 7. Don't understand that with today's technology, this should not be an issue and is unacceptable."
4,"quintessential, Marvin Gaye","I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS ALBUM. It is funky, smooth, rythmic, caressing and everything I remember and love about Mr. Gaye. It makes me want to dance, sit back and reflect or just chill. I am so happy to finally have this in my collection. Soooooo, cool!!!!!"
3,average,not a significant worthy selection.poor art work layout.although great audio recording.good value at great price.good representation of the era.
5,Best Gaye album ever,"I agree with other reviewers here. This is the best of Marvin's albums in his illustrious career and that's saying a lot with Here, My Dear, What's Going On and Let's Get It On. It is also one of my 10 favorite ablums of all time."
5,I Want You - Again!,"I was into this album back in 1976 when it first came out. This is probably my favorite album of Marvin's as an adult woman, because the subject matter of the songs are more intimate and mature for me than when I was in my early teens when the What's Going On album came out in the early 70's (it's my second fav by Marvin). Marvin is clearly singing his most intimate thoughts of his second wife Janis, on this album, just like he was doing on the Let's Get It On album. Anyway, I love I Want You, and if you purchase it, YOU WILL TOO - I promise you!!"
4,Good story!,"Imagine being sisters with your worst enemy. This is how Sophia Rizzo and Sarah Thomas feel. Sophia's mom is dating Sarah's dad, and worst of all, they plan to marry! Sophia and Sarah must work through their dislike of each other to discover that they can be friends. Sweet story. Check it out!"
3,STEP away!,"Sarah is sweet but spoilt,ultra feminine,and has pale skin and waves in her hair.Sophia is tough,with short tight-curly hair and dark italian looks.They are totally different.The only thing they have in common is that they are both missing one parent.(Sophia's father was a no-hoper who left.Sarah's mum is dead)Oh,and there is one other thing they share in common!They hate eachother!!The 2 do nothing but fight and when SARAHS DAA AND SOPHIAS MUM fall in ...LOVE!! they are determined NOT to let them marry!!!!!!!Let the parent plots begin."
3,I dont read it much,"It isnt the very best SVT book,still good though.Sarah and Sophia are very different and bad enemies,and now Sarah dad and Sophias mum are in love!!"
5,GOODBYE BROOKLYN'S ROSE,"I PURCHASED THIS CD THE WEEK IT WAS RELEASED. IT WAS ALL I EXPECTED, AND MORE. I RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY. TRAGICALLY, THIS IS HER LAST CD, AS HER VOICE HAS BEEN SILENCED. HOW CAN YOU MEASURE SUCH A SHORT LIFE AGAINST THE POTENTIAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS SHE COULD HAVE ACHIEVED HAD SHE LIVED? NONETHELESS, SHE WILL LIVE IN OUR HEARTS FOREVER. SHE WILL FOREVER BE BROOKLYN'S ROSE."
5,This CD is wonderful...I'll never forget Aaliyah!,"Aaliyah's death shocked me - so I went out and bought this CD to support her. I didn't know I'd love it this much! My favorite tracks on this CD are ""We Need A Resolution"", ""U Got Nerve"", ""More Than A Woman"", and ""Those Were The Days"". AALIYAH is now one of my most favorite albums that I own. I didn't think her last album would come so soon - she was just beginning as an artist! When I think of Aaliyah's death, it reminds me of the late Latin singer's, Selena. They were both very young, beautiful, talented, and just starting off their careers when they died. Aaliyah has a soulful, strong and powerful voice and her music is just amazing. You must buy this album and all of her other albums because they are simply wonderful, too. I think I speak for all her fans when I say this: Aaliyah, you were truly an amazing, inspiring young woman and we will miss you! Thank you for reading this. And I hoped it helped."
5,~Aaliyah~,"I totally love this CD of Aaliyah, and I love her. She's so pretty! But now that she isn't here no more, her music still lives on and her fans still love her. I recommend you all buy this CD today, it's worth the money!!My favorite songs on here are, More than a woman and Rock the boat!!!"
5,"I miss you, girl!",I just can't believe Miss Aaliyah ain't with us no more. It just ain't right. Girlfriend had it together. She coulda been the new Aretha. I am really feelin' this CD. I miss her!
5,Need a Resolution,"Aaliyah is very versatile and a great artist. Meaning that she can go from hip hop to ballads and her music be irresistable. When I first heard ""We Need a Resolution"" It took me by surprise, because it was different from anything she had written before, but the more I heard it, it actually became my favorite song. I look forward to hearing it in the clubs. Because we truly need resolutions to today's problems and issues. I've been following Aaliyah since ""Age Ain't Nothing But A Number"" I enjoy her music, her style and all that follows. She will truly be missed and continually loved. The CD is GREAT!!....."
3,"Good, but NOT up to her potential","I've liked Aaliyah ever since her Age Ain't Nothing But a Number album. So, of course I got this cd too. However, I think that she could have done a better job at this. I mean, it's good, but it could have been SOOOO much better. I like Loose Rap, Rock the Boat, Never No More, Extra Smooth, We Need a Resolution, and a few others. But even the songs that I like could have been a little better. I wouldn't say NOT to buy this, but I'd recommend listening to the whole thing first. AND... I'm sorry, but it's about time that Aaliyah start writing her own lyrics! I mean, it would be nice to hear songs that are actually from HER heart, not someone else's. Overall, it's good, but could have been so much better."
5,"AHHHHHAAAAA BOOO HOOOO! AAHLIYAH""S DEAD<<<<<<< NO JOKE","Aahliah died in a car crash. I personally have not listened to any songs off this album exept ""WE NEED A RESOULTION"" Aahliah was only 22. Can you imagine, riding in a plane, in perfect weather, the right when you land, you die instantly! I'm sorry, but my heart his broken forver now that she is dead. It's just horrible, i mean she seamed so full of life, and she died right after her album came out, and her new video, the second single off the album. I'm just really hurt. It's really sad."
5,That's All,"I Miss U A lot. Hate myself when I rpt ""How come"" all the time... ""How come""???????? Silence is the key for endurance. Please rest in peace. 'Coz, this world needs u in all the ways. I miss u a lot... AND, THAT'S ALL I CAN DO!"
2,I liked Aaliyah but I have to tell the truth,"Her 3rd LP was not as great as One in A Million. I only like four songs on the whole album. Matter of fact, I don't listen to the album at all. I bought the album out of respect for Aaliyah because she seemed so sweet and nice. To bad I will never get to met her."
2,tried too much,"Aalyah's new self-titled album is big on trying out new cutting edge sounds, but not big on making great songs. Most Aaliyah fans who liked the lead single ""We Need A Resolution,"" will probably like #3 ""Rock the Boat"" and #6 ""Care For You"" which are slow songs. They are actual flowing songs, which are a rarity on this disk, which is filled with so many music and temo changes, that you can't tell if the song is supposed to make you dance or cry. The one good thing about the disk is that it shows off Aaliyah's vocal talent more than anything she's done before, and while she'll never be a diva it shows that she is a more than competent singer. I give the album 2 stars because it is groundbreaking, but it shows me that sometimes it's just good to stick to your past formula."
5,Tight as eva!!!,"I have been waiting for a long time for this and was pretty sure Baby Girl was gonna represent, but I never expected this. This is the best album of the year I have heard. I could break it down track to track, but I don't have the energy right now. What I can say is, there are no low points to this album!! You will not have to hit the ""Forward"" button once. To me, that says a lot. You have to check it out.One."
4,Another good Aaliyah album,"Aaliyah is one of my most favorite female artist. Besides her ""One In A Million Album"", I think this is a good album. She brings some tracks that make you wanna dance while other tracks are slower and speak on relationships and love. I miss you Aaliyah!!!!"
1,not good quality,I purchased this CD used and indeed it was USED. Skipped from beginning to the end. This maybe my last time buying from here. I purchase a double CD of Janet Jackson Design of Decade and only received the single disc CD. So enough is enough.
3,Good album for a collection,Aaliyah provides some good tunes and carries the show to let folks know that she has the goods to be a star for a long time prior to her early departure.
5,A mature album with mature songs,For a long time i wanted this version of this album and now i finally got it.I couldn't be more content especially with song try again.It's so sad Aaliyah died at such a young age because she was getting ready to take off.Most of her songs were amazing and she sounded like a sweet and kind person with her soft voice.What a beautiful soul.This record represents a beautiful soul.May she rest in peace.She shall soar in heaven.
4,"Rest In Peace, Baby Girl","Aaliyah's third and sadly last album is one that took me by surprise. I had come to expect the standard pop charts-friendly songs that had brought her to a place of fame. Although uptempo tracks are not my favourites, her songs had proven to be very good. I an act of memorial, I purchased the album.I discovered an album that was very different from what I expected. As well as several amazingly listenable uptempo tracks, their were some really lovely ballads. The track ""It's Whatever"" almost makes me cry everytime I hear it. The song sounds so sad, and her voice is so beautiful and fits perfectly.Many of my friends and my cousin think this album is not that good, but I think they missed the point of this album. Well done Aaliyah, may you rest in peace."
5,Aaliyah = Excellence,"This 2004 edition is superb! It just reminds us what an amazing talent Aaliyah was. From the laid back ""We Need A Resolution"" to the sultry ""Rock The Boat"" to the timeless classic ""I Care 4 U"", this album is a must for ALL Aaliyah & R&B lovers! It also includes some bonus tracks right at the end. Rest In Peace Baby Girl - We Miss You So Much. God Bless. ~A~"
3,A Little Off Target,"This is a decent album, but something seems to be missing. I don't know if it's because the tracks seem too similar w/ one another, or if it's because the beats weren't catchy enough... but, it doesn't hit the spot for me. It's not a bad album, since ""I Care 4 U"" and ""We Need A Resolution"" were hits, and a few of the other tracks seem to be nice, but it certainly could have used a couple more solid jams to make it a better album. Aaliyah is stunningly beautiful and sexy, but this album doesn't do her justice. If you don't have any of Aaliyah's albums, I'd recommend getting her first release than this one."
5,Beautiful!,"About 4 years ago this album came out.I never really understood this album until I picked it up two months ago and I finally liked the album as a whole instead of just the singles.The album has such a different vibe unlike most music out now.""I Refuse"" is my personal favorite on the whole album.It is like the crown that holds the whole album together.""Those Were the Days"" follows in at my second fav.I believe Aaliyah knew what she was doing when she made this album.She really knew she was making a ground breaking album."
1,TRY AGAIN SORRY!!!,this cd will half to grow on me because it has nothing on one in a million what's wrong with ya'll are you guys really desperate for AAliyah from her long break I guess so but # 11 is the best and the only song I like and rock the boat is catchy but it did not catch me !!! sorry baby girl !!!
3,BORING,I used to loved it. I barely listen to it anymore. It wil get to you REALLY soon. And it'll make you hate the songs really soon. My advice? Dont bother to buy it.
1,This was her failure album to me,"Aaliyah was a good person, at least thats what you guys are saying.But do any of you all know her,NO,DIDN'T THINK SO!!!!She could have beeen the meanest person in the world, and nobody would know.You all have no idea how crazy you all sound talking about that girl like you all knew her!To me this album was stupid!!!It was not all that good as you all are trying to make it seem(just cause she dead)And heres something you guys didn't know, her album was number 55 on the charts for a while, and that's not good to me.Then she dies and it goes straight to #1.Am I the only one that notices how dumb that looks on the fans.You all didn't talk about that girl at all when she was alive.There were never any specials on her really, until she died.She got most of her fame from her dealth.The album sucked.She did a horrible job.I heard that album once, and hated it.Don't waste your money coustomers.It's not worth it.!!!I highly Recommend Brandy's Full Moon, though!*"
4,"Not exceptional, but good!","Aaliyah's new effort is decent. To me, she's taking R&B into new areas. One of change, which is better. There's even a rock influenced track on this CD. Although I can't say that I really like it, at least she's doing something different from all these others out here. And it is a step in a new direction. There are some really good songs on this CD like ""We Need a Resolution"", ""Loose Rap"" and ""More than woman"". For a 21 year-old girl like her, she seems mature beyond her years. Even more mature than an older artist like Janet Jackson. It's clear that Aaliyah is mature and different from most female artists and her latest effort definitely deserves attention."
4,"AALIYAH, YOU WERE TRULY ""ONE IN A MILLION"" THANK YOU!",Before I review this cd. I would like to send my condolences to Ms. Aaliyah Haughton's family and those other family members that lost their loved ones in this tragedy.Sometime's less means more and simply put. This cd allowed us to see the growth and maturity in such a talented young lady. I have all her cd's and she will be truly missed.
3,Keep it real,"So it tragic that she is no longer with us. But I have to keep it real. The cd is not all that. I can say that because unlike so many people boosting record saled out of sympathy, I bought it before her passing and sorry it just didnt move me. The beats have a toe tapping effect but she got pushed out of rotation long time ago. Resoluton and rock the boat had potential but all the rest sound like that whole teen pop thang.I personally loved her first cd but my mind frame was different back then, so choose wisely."
3,Not What I Expected,"I expected much more from Aaliyah and I'm sad to say that i was very disappointed with my purchase of this. There are a few good songs on this CD like We need a resolution, loose rap, rock the boat and more than a woman. But most of these songs are stupid. She has tried to change up into her own style of music, which isn't bad, but I perfered her other style.I gave this CD 3 stars because More than a woman is a great song and some of the songs have a good message (i refuse), and because it is Aaliyah. I just feel that she could have made a much better CD over the course of 5 years."
