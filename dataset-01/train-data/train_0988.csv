5,my z garmet rack,this is a very good product is that good that i want another ZGarmet Rack Commercial Grade send me one more
3,Very good resouce,"While this is a good resource book, it seems to be largely a reprint of Andrew J Blackbird's earlier book, ""History of the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan"". Section II by Wm Raymond Kiogima is helpful, containing an English to Odawa dictionary and grammar reference, along with stories told by Odawa ancestors."
3,Good read.,"Very interesting plot and quite a creative story. In the end I wasn't really sure what the take home message was for it. I enjoyed reading it, but it really did not touch or evoke a lot of emotion for me."
4,Works great but wish it had LED display of time and counter,I bought this at Wal-mart for under $100 and think it is a great deal. This is a replacement to my Toshiba that just died after 2 years. It records great. It plays DVDs I recorded on my computer which the Toshiba wouldn't. I only wish that it had a LED display of the time and counter.
1,"Worldwide Distributors, a big RIP OFF!!!!",The recorder stopped working within 28 days. I called Worldwide Distributors and explained what had taken place. They sent me a return shipping label. I boxed it up in a U.S.P.S. box and took it Post Office and mailed it back. After a month I called them to find out was taking place with the replacement unit they were to send me. I was informed that I had to prove that I mailed it back. They have NO Record of the returned machine. SO SAD GOODBYE!!!
5,Works great.,Thanks a million it works better than my old one.The packing was in great shape too. Also thanks for rca cable will come in handy.For being used it works great. Very glad i bought it. Half what i paid for my other one.
1,Magnavox Mwr10D6,"Magnavox Mwr10D6 Did Not Record, Customer Service No Help. Must Known Product Was Faulty. Warning. Do Not Take A Chance. Burned And Still Smoking."
3,Interesting,I needed it for class and it came on time. It was well organized and easy to read. The product was in good condition..... YOu also have to understand what you are reading or else it's difficult to follow through.
2,Not a Keeper,"Pink Floyd is high up on my list of obsessions, and as such they occupy much shelf space - hosts of discs, original albums, books and the like. Sad to say this, the only first-person account of the band, from drummer Nick Mason, is not exactly a page-turner. The only interest to me was the wealth of previously unseen photgraphs. The text is another matter. As dry as the British sense of humour has ever been, oh so dull and with nary a whiff of kiss and tell or anything truly relevatory. Details are passed over in such a way that leads the reader to believe Mason didn't want to step on any toes or betray any loyalties. There is a terrific Floyd story to be told, I am sure of that. This, however, is not the place to look for it."
3,...Isn't this where.....???,"If you're a fan....if you've read anything about Floyd, Syd, or Roger Waters before...this really isn't the book for you.Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the book. It was interesting to read some of the ""behind the music"" bits, but if you fall into the catagory of people above, you'll be looking for all the new stuff...and you won't find it.Nick gives little insight to the history of the band. It just seems like he's reporting the same exact information that any true fan already knows inside and out...without adding anything fresh to it.So why the 3 stars? BECAUSE IT'S NICK MASON!!!! He's in the band, man!!! Just to have a Floyd member's words in print is a pretty rare thing these days. Go out and get it, and then judge for yourself."
4,Funny and well mooded.,"I laughed *a lot* while reading this book. Nick is very well mooded and funny. Would like to hear more on the technical aspects of PF though, but I guess that would be something to be heard from Roger instead. The highest part is when Nick states that a producer, after meeting the recently contracted guitarist David Gilmour, thought that he would be the leader of the band, ""not noticing the rather tall bass player on the back"". :-)"
4,Old Friends Revisited,"As an avid Floyd fan since the early 70s it was particularly enjoyable to hear how the band formed, developed, and folded from an insider's point of view. Well written, unbiased and a great read."
5,Excellent history of Pink Floyd,"Any fan of Pink Floyd, no matter how much you appreciate their music, must own this book."
5,Must Have,A complete history written by the most laid back drummer in rock history. Mason is the one constant in Floyd and the only member of the band who could do its legacy full justice. The photos alone are worth the price of the book. The section on Syd is honest and respectful and of course the determination of Gilmour and Mason to keep the band going is riveting. It should never be underestimted how difficult emotionally and logistically that decision was. All fans of the band should take a look.
3,Great pictures,"I'm not a rabid fan of Floyd and this is the first book I've read about this band. To me, a lot of pages are wasted describing the producers, management, technicians, and the early years (pre-1972) of the band (almost half the book). The typical items of interest... sex and drugs are completely ignored. Also, very little is written about the fans, the creative process involved in writing the music, and there is no mention of favorite songs. The devastating effect of Syd's mental deterioration must have been horrible to observe. But what's heartbreaking is, not once does Nick mention visiting Syd or inquiring about his health.Overall, this is enjoyable to read, contains some intriguing moments and has lots of great pictures."
4,All Pink Floyd fans must have it....,"The day I knew that Nick Mason was lauched this book I bought it....It is a beautiful book, with lots of photos and the viewpoint of Nick Mason about the history of Pink Floyd. Nick seems to be the most well related member of the band, then he reports the history of each member and their relation with the music in the early years, carrying the reader to that epoc. The language he used is full of humor and details.I recomend it to all Pink Floyd fans...."
1,Clip On Bed Lamp,"I bought two of these. One broke almost immediately. The clamp spring jumped out of position and I could not get it back in place. The swivel action on the second lamp went south shortly after. The lamp had one position after that.. facing ""south"". Good idea, but poor construction."
4,"Exit, Voice & Loyalty","Swell book, full of fresh ideas (though written 40 years ago). Real eye-opener in terms of helping me to give a shape and structure to fragmentary thoughts and feelings I had on this topic before...The only remark I have concerns a technical issue - transport of the book:Although I got the book OK and quickly (despite I live overseas), I found the book lying at my door - which is not quite usual in my country; it could have been lost very easily (as there unfortunately are lots of thieves)...Please consider instructing your transport company (UPS?) to keep the delivery at their nearest office (where I could pick it up) when I'm not at home."
5,Great Technology for the price!,"The Miglia Tech Firewire audio Interface works GREAT!! Has a soft-clipping feature built-in and gives great clean sound. So easy to use. I hope Miglia Tech keeps expanding their product offerings! Takes 2 channels in, but gives surround sound out if needed! Fantastic buy!"
4,US games color class ribbons,"These ribbons have given my 9 year old grand-daughter numerous hours of enjoyment. They have become a badge of pride as she works with them. It kind of takes me back to my own childhood when the simple things meant a lot to each of us, and many of them became treasure within our memories."
4,Just right for little ones,"These ribbons are just right for little ones....I must say, though, that I thought they'd be bigger. Overall, a good value."
3,ribbons!,The ribbon and wands had great color!! we used them in our dance ministry.. They are a great buy but the ribbons need a bit more weight to use in dance.. Still a good buy!
5,ribbon wands,"Great product, kids loved them. We used them during the music portion of Vacation Bible School. The older kids loves twirling them, and some of the little ones used the handles as ""microphones"". These added to our music program and we'll be sure to use them again next year."
5,These are just..,"plain fun!!! Great if you have little girls (7,9) like I do that love to act like ballerinas, cheerleaders, dance instructors etc.... Adds a sense of flair to their play."
5,Great to organize a refrigerator,No more getting on the floor to see what is in the back of the refrigerator shelves. The plastic is very sturdy is just the right size.
5,Couldn't be better!,Speakers sound great for the price and size. They are as described (although it was difficult to tell size from the picture/description). They arrived in a timely fashion. Couldn't ask for more than that!
3,Pink is Questionable!,"I purchased these pink speakers for my daughter to go with her Pink Creative Zen Micro MP3. When they arrived, they were more of a metallic violet color. Not ""bubble gum pink"" like the MP3. Not even close to matching. I returned them unopened to amazon and only got a portion of my money refunded. Make sure this is what you really want before ordering. I cannot comment on sound or quality as I did not open the package."
3,COLOR NOT WHAT YOU SEE HERE!,"I PURCHASED THESE PINK SPEAKERS FOR MY DAUGHTER TO GO WITH HER PINK ZEN MICRO. WHEN THEY ARRIVED, I THOUGHT AMAZON SENT THE WRONG COLOR BECAUSE THEY LOOK MORE LIKE A VIOLET COLOR. AFTER CHECKING THE PART NUMBER ON THE BOX WITH THE CREATIVE WEB SITE, I FOUND THEY ARE THE PINK SPEAKERS. THEY ARE NOT EVEN CLOSE TO MATCHING HER PINK ZEN MICRO! I CAN NOT COMMENT ON THE SOUND QUALITY SINCE I HAVE NOT OPENED THE PACKAGE BECAUSE THEY ARE A CHRISTMAAS GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER, BUT SINCE I HAVE HEARD OTHER CREATIVE SPEAKERS I AM ASSUMING THEY WILL SOUND VERY GOOD FOR THE INTENDED PURPOSE."
2,maybe I didn't get it,"Found it hard to get into, and still felt that way more than halfway through. Didn't care a lot about the characters; disliked the author's way of jumping back and forth through time (though I don't mind the ways some authors do so). Was more touched by the dog's death than anything else!"
1,Only because I like Kell..,"Dance Fu= Good. See Dick Run= Not so good. I'm a proud supporter of independent movies and I don't go hard on them the way I would a big budget film, as independent film projects just have cut corners and make it happen the best way they can, but I was expecting more. Kell was adorable and funny enough as usual but the story was flat. There were few laughs, it's obvious that it was shot with a cheaper quality camera, the acting was so so but we'll just blame that on the script. I couldn't really get into the film, halfway thru I just gave up. Don't be fooled by the girls on the cover either, if your watching this for gorgeous Dollicia Bryant she only shows up for 2 minutes if that. If you want to see Kells' better works try Ganked or Dance Fu. If your still curious, rent it maybe?"
3,"This young man Kel Mitchell has lost his mind,..","This young man Kel Mitchell has lost his mind,.. His characters keep you in mind of the Jim Carrey's, Robin Williams,Eddy Murphy or Damon Wayans.. This movie here could be his proposal to more charaters of status..."
5,All Hail Dollicia,This movie is a five star film because of the first girl shown in the film. Her name is Dollicia Bryan...she is the most beautiful girl in the world.
4,Garcia Marquez es unico,"Disfrute tanto de esta novela, que la volvi a leer pero en Ingles. Desde luego que la novela se saborea mejor en la hermosa lengua Española, pero la traduccion al Ingles no esta tan peor. No a todos les gusta el estilo de Garcia Marquez, pero lo que es a mi, su estilo me encanta. Es unico. Se han dado cuenta como el autor siempre se refiere a sus personajes por sus nombres y apellidos? (por ejemplo, nunca dice solamente el primer nombre; siempre este va acompañado de el apellido.) Que original, no? Porque le di solo 4 estrellas? Soy una amante de los clasicos, y no me gusta que este libro contiene muchas cosas que no son edificantes. Un buen clasico (como War and Peace, de Tolstoy) no necesita vulgaridad ni malas palabras para dejar huella."
5,El Amor en los Tiempos del Cólera,"Even better than the movie. It has some strong vocabulary that begins in the middle of the book. I bought it for high school students, only mature ones should read it."
3,At times a great love story,"The first and final quarters of this novel are an extraordinary comparative meditation of the infatuated love between two young people, and the realistic--more rewarding friendship-- between two older lovers. Unfortunately, the middle section is slow and uninteresting. However, the lessons discovered at the end are worth some drudgery."
1,NO PIERDAN SU TIEMPO,Es aburrido ! aburrido. Que clase de historia de amor la protagonista no le hace caso y se la pasa 50 años esperandola mientras fornica con cuanta mujer se le atraviesa. Eso es amor ? Y le hace caso hasta que esta sola y vieja ?
3,Pudo haber hecho mejor,"Definitivamente no es el mejor libro de Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Los he leido casi todo. Le falto el realismo magico y alguna pequena referencia a Macondo, que tanto caracteriza sus novelas. Tiene una buena narrativa, que te envuelve y no quieres dejar a un lado el libro. Me gusta la manera que el convierte el pasado en presente, logras entender todo el trama de la novela como si el tiempo no existiera."
1,Never got it,"Never got the product, got the worst feedback possible on my order, nest time will order bokks with any method but Amazon. I wanted it for a present and because of the delay and no feedback my opportunity was blow."
4,Very entertaining,"Yo diria que Gabriel Garcia Marquez es el Faulkner de nuestra America. Latin America. ""Colera"" no es ciertamente los ""Cien años de Soledad"" pero una vez que uno comienza a leerle no puede parar hasta terminarlo. Me fascinó."
5,Very reliable,"The book is exactly what I wanted and the shipping arrival was very efficient. I can't wait to use the book for class, it seems really interesting."
3,Vegetarian Mother & Baby Book,"This book had some good info about nutrition, and good sample recipes, but I thought a lot of the info was too general - it covered a lot of things that I wasn't interested in. She never went in depth about nutrition enough, just kind of short blurbs on general baby care, which is not what I was looking for in this book. It also seemed a bit dated."
3,good and bad,"Although this book does give many good recipies and great meal plans for mamma and baby, I found some of the advice to be not so helpful. ""Don't ever heat your baby's food in the microwave..."" Then YOU come over and entertain my child while I light a safety candle underneath the pot to heat up his lunch! Also, some of the advice contradicts many pediatricians with regard to when one should introduce certain foods into a baby's diet. You must use your common sense here. Finally, I think the author should stick to meal plans, recipes and nutrition and leave the babycare advice to someone a bit more qualified than a vegetarian astrologer."
5,It really dosen't matter. Man decides his/her own faith.,"The book is interesting and well written, however ,I was looking for an understanding of fundamentalist views. Instead I find entertainment. Religions are inheritly good. It teaches ethics and morals. The problem is man cannot control himself. He distorts and manipulates religion for his own greed. The result has made religion a poison in society. It has brought life pain and nothing more. If you believe in God, living lies you created from the Koran or Bible, then expect to be punished. All suicide bombers(or murderers), greed driven men and abusers of the innocence of earth will be punished. Me I'm an atheist and don't really care. It's just sad people kill each other over dirt and a God that allows you to suffer. This book will convice you of man as a hopeless case."
5,BEST ISLAMIC BOOK EVER WRITTEN,"Don`t be misled by others.This is the best book ever written on the subject of Islam.It has the potential to unite us all.It is only fair that everyone have access to the facts and truth which are found in this book.Read it, you will treasure it.Believe me, I know, because I have a copy which I already read."
3,Interesting reading,"I just finished this book, motivated to find out more about Islam in light of recent events. While I agree that the doctrines of Islam, as illustrated in this book, are good and noble ones, it seems that it is subject to the same affliction that plagues many other religions - the hipocrisy of man in its practical application. There is much suffering in the world that exists at the hand of man that is ""justified"" by religious principles and Islamic countries are not exempt from this fact.As for the irrefutable scientific evidence, statistical information can, and often is, manipulated to arrive a pre-determined conclusions. I'm not saying it is absolutely wrong but a definitive source of information it is not.By all means, read this book as a information source; a starting point for a more thorough examination, but it is not the end all, be all it purports to be."
3,"Well written, misleading title","At the time I ordered this book, there were no reviews available. Oh, well. At least we will be alerting future prospective readers.As several others, I bought this book to try to see how one could justify extremist views. I found it well-written (doesn't appear at all to be a translation or written by a non-English-speaker), instructional, and moderate in its views. (I am an atheist myself.)But its first claim is simply one that many religions claim - theirs is the true one, and in the end, it will win. Its second claim is simply historical - nations wax and wane. Not exactly mind-blowing stuff....It occurs to me now, looking at the title again, that it wasn't so extreme. There you go."
2,Title Fraud?,"The answer to the three questions raised by the title of the book are 1) Islam is the only true religion, therefore Islam will conquer all other religions 2) American power will diminish since all civilizations rise and fall (Rome, Greece, Persia, etc) 3) Allah's predictions will soon come to pass since we live in the ""Last Days"".There are in the book interesting sections on Islamic religious and philosophical schools through the centuries, and the various sects of Islam; also a short section on Muhammad (not a man to cross!).However, if you are looking to buy this book based on the title, forget it."
1,Interesting but somewhat faulty,"The book is very interesting and I learned much about the history and development of Islam as a world religion. I totally disagree that the United States will fall apart like the Soviet Union. Obviously the author has not studied the history of the US or totally rejects how we became the nation that we are. To even suggest that the states will secede like the breakup of the Soviet Union is fantasy based on his own interpretation. But overall, the book suggests that it is written by God. Other religions say more or less the same as Islam but who does know the truth? Clearly God has not spoken to anyone lately and if he has, who would believe them? I recommend the book but only as an insight into a great religion. Other than that, a great disappointment."
2,Hey Duh-wayne Follick,"In case you don't know (which obviously you don't) ""Reviewing a book"" means you actually have to read it first.Nice try at intellectualism though."
3,Kirby?,Not sure if this is a genuine Kirby part because it was a loose fit on the upper bag side connection. The lower hose to thread screwed in nicely with soapy water but the top needed to be fastened with silicon RTV and tie wraps to hold it in place. Other than that it works just fine..
4,Packed with Pictures!,"Although small, this book has plenty of well done, fairly explicit photograhs."
5,Gives understanding to our Biblical authurity to heal.,"This book helped me to more fully understand the Biblical foundations we have in approaching God on behalf of the needful. Although I grew up in the Pentecostal church, I really did not believe or understand His character and His authority to heal given to His childern. If you have struggled with this topic of healing then get this book. It will strengthen your relationship with the Lord and impact the needful around you."
3,Interesting Music!,"I was told about this band recently and decided to give it a shot. When I finished listening to it I had mixed feelings. The style of this band is undoubtedly different from other brazilian rock bands like Paralamas do Sucesso, Skank, Pato Fu, Titas, etc. but not bad at all. It's just different. There are some interesting songs on this album. This band is definitely not at the same level of other brazilian rock bands but it's nice. A good addition to my collection."
4,Wonderful Holiday Season Pattern,"These match my Winterberry pattern perfectly, but needs to be lightly handwashed to keep the paint from flaking off."
5,bought a second one,"Bought this for my mother and it broke while in storage in the off year while in the attic. Very nice glass, but pack away carefully."
5,Old World Glassware,I bought these glassware items for my wife for Christmas because they remind us of the hand painted classware that was given to us many years ago but have not survived the years and children.The items themselves are made very well and made my wife very happy.........(not all that easy to do).
3,ugly orangey red,"I was so excited to find red speakers to go with the rest of my house, but I didn't realize how ugly these were. They're a bright orangey red color. I guess it's my fault- the online picture is exactly the color. Also, they're TINY. Maybe 4 inches high. Sound quality however is pretty good considering size and price."
3,good story--impressive first effort,"I really enjoyed this book. I loved the Kenya setting--I just wish the author had included more detail about the animals and people of the area. The author created a good story with very appealing characters. Very impressive for a first novel. I hope Melanie Craft writes more books, as she is a welcome addition to the Romance genre!"
5,GREAT beach reading!!!,"My mom reads lots of romances and just cleaned out her storage room (SCARY!) and gave me a bunch of old books. This one is good summer reading!!! I really liked it, except that the hero needed more of a sense of humor. But he turned out to be nice in the end. It was exciting becaue it was set in Kenya, and I thought Lilah was someone who I would like if I met her. Recommended!!!"
4,Perfect Beach Read!,Hard Hearted Man was a great read. The main characters have excellent chemistry and the setting was not typical of the average romance novel. Very fun and a real page turner!!
4,Great read,"I didn't like it at first, but Epstein won me over very quickly, and I finally found that I couldn't put it down. He is a broad ranging thinker, drawing in insights from mythology, psychoanalysis, and Buddhism to build a convincing case that desire properly harnessed can be a route to greater understanding and appreciation of self and other."
5,Faces of Evil Book Review,"Ever watched CSI? Been consumed by a forensics novel? Well those two have nothing on this book. This is the real deal, a look into forensic art and its artists. As a fellow forensic artist I was naturally drawn to the book, but in reality it is quite a page turner for any reader. The book contains anecdotes as well as an instigative look into the art its self. After reading this book you will be convinced that forensic art is a necessary tool in criminal investigation. This book is a great read for forensic artists, those interested in forensic art, those involved in criminal investigation, as well as anyone who has ever wanted to get the real scoop. After reading this book it is truly evident how successful Lois Gibson is as a forensic artist due to her overwhelming compassion for the field."
5,So Happy...,I was so happy to get a replacement ring for my blender and it came so qiuckly. I love amazon.com
5,Perfect,"Very well written book. Though you have to have some beginning-level knowledge of Personal Oracle8 before you pick up this book. Some chapters are summarized because of the advanced nature of topic. However, they would make more sense if they might have been summarized more in general term, e.g., NCA chapter. In summary, this is an excellent source to learn Personal Oracle8 and then move to Enterprise Oracle."
1,"poorly written, misled reader.","this book is poorly written. for example:1. in ch. 1, the author talks about start database without mention what database you are actually starting or what 'start database' means. 2. in ch.2, you suppose to create a new database, but all you see from the author is how to create a project under personal oracle 8 what is the difference between a database and project! nothing is said. 3.what is that local database? the author's writting is so confusing. 4. the author misled the reader to think the cd accompany the book has peronal oracle on it. IT DOES NOT! the cd of the book only contains junks!this list can go on and on and on! don't waste your money!"
5,An Extremely good book to learn from.,"I have found this book to be essential, in the learning process of Oracle8. I use it to teach my students on the basics of the Oracle Database.Although the book does come with a copy of the demo database onthe CDROM, there is no copy of Personal Oracle8. But you can get a free copy from Oracle, so this is no real problem.Overall this book have proved to be invaluable."
2,Item is undersized,"While the shirt looks fantastic, it is way undersized. I ordered a 2XL and the product I received was a M at best."
4,Hawaiian shirt review,"I am very pleased with my Hawaiian shirt. The colors are very vibrant and I have fun wearing it to work on casual Fridays. This company was very good to deal with. It was shipped quickly and came well packaged. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I think it should have been cut a little bit bigger for an extra large. I am used to my Hawaiian shirts being a looser fit. Otherwise, it's a great shirt and I will probably order more in the future."
3,Right Sized,"Well guess what! I went by the previous reviews and ordered a size larger and am now stuck with an oversized shirt. The piece is good in itself, but...! Guess they got their sizing right!"
3,"Pretty and well made, but nonstandard sizing.","We bought four of these shirts (not this color) and as soon as my husband put one on, he realized his ability to move was very limited. After a lot of head scratching I compared this shirt to other shirts in his closet (he wears Large) and found that although the shoulder width was the same as his other shirts, the measurement around the chest was 5-6"" smaller than all of his other shirts, which included LLBean, Armani, Van Heusen, Lands End, and Geoffrey Beene."
1,Somewhat Happy,"Product was fine, however, problem with the sizing itself. This product was undersized (i.e., and did not fit well) for how it was promoted by the saler. If you purchase this item, recommend that you buy at least one or two sizes larger."
4,great product,this is a good leash for the money. It doesnt fit into every seat belt buckle though. it fits my mustang but not an oldsmobile aurora. Just thought you might appreciate my input.
5,Very useful!,"I found the seatbelt leash very helpful. I hooked it up to the middle buckle in my car and my dog was able to reach each window, when the leash was fully extended to 3 feet. I put a harnace on my dog, that I currently owned, so as not to choke the dog, in case of an accident. I liked that the leash gave me peace of mind, while driving long distances, and my dog slept most of the time anyway, so she didn't really care about the leash. The hook on the leash is very heavy duty, so it was heavier than my usual leashes' hooks(for my 20 lb. dog), but again, she just slept and didn't mind it. I'm very happy with the purchase. It is great quality and was well worth the money."
4,Everyone should protect their dog,"Honestly I haven't used this product yet but I can see by looking at it that it's going to work for my dog. If your dog moves around alot when they drive in a car this product should be used. Your dog is like a baby and like a baby who needs a carseat a dog also needs something so they don't get throw around in the when making turns or stopping short. This secures your dog and will save your dogs life if by some chance their is an accident, As I said I haven't used this product yet only because I don't have a car but my friends do and I tested this when I drove in their car with my dog and it does work and easy to use"
3,poor quality,"when i opened the package and took the leash out the stitching on the handle was so loose I could take the two pieces apart. I am only using the leash in the car and not as a leash so I didn't contact the seller to return it, but I was disappointed that they would send out a product that was so poorly made. The buckle is very small and difficult to get in the seat belt latch. my dog kept stepping on the latch and releasing the buckle until I turned the latch upside down and pushed it back into where it comes out of the seat. It is a decent product other than the quality of the handle. It keeps my dog from jumping around in the car."
1,"This is not a ""Jimmy Stewart"" movie.","I bought 2 other Jimmy Stewart movies and this one was listed ""People who bought my ""Jimmy Stewart"" movies also bought ""this"" movie. This movie C rated piece of garbage that doe not star ""Jimmy Stewart"", at least not the Jimmy Stewart the world knows and loves. This is the last time I choose one of Amazon's recommended ""picks"". Garbage movie!"
4,Actual broadcast games rights too expensive...,"Slowly, but surely the NFL is realizing the value in the reissue and selling of early NFL Films material. This is not complete, as other reviewers have stated, but it is the best product they have offered of this legendary Bears team. So far. Hopefully if this sells, we fans can look forward to the actual rebroadcast of the games (NFL Network?)or sell them in a package. Who knows, maybe other games and seasons (good and bad) may be made available."
1,"Da Bears, dey still blow!!!","Biggest waste of money ever. These guys were lucky this year. Notice they didn't put in the games that they didn't play well in??? They should have won maybe 5 games this season. Incredible what a little luck will do, along with a buffoon for a head coach."
5,1985 Chicago Bears,There is not many dvd's of Bears Super Bowl wins (LOL) and this is such a treasure to think how they were once before egos got in the way. Bill
5,If your a bear Fan,The DVD;s are great. For those of us who loved the 85 bears you can relive the action over and over
5,'Bout time!!,"PERFECT for every BEARS fan, esp. those of us who remember this historic season!!! As with most reviews of this product, only wish ALL of the games were included. The NFL will get it right someday!"
4,Not all games,"The cover of the DVD says ""12 Classic Games"" so don't expect all games from the 85 season. Looking forward to this DVD."
2,Another irritating book from Puzo,"This is Puzo's third sell of a tired and worn out story line, a mafia family trying to go straight. The characters are larger than life as always is the case in a Puzo novel and the dialog is corny. This book is a complete waste of paper. The only time Puzo's work can stand up is when Francis Ford Coppola salvages it."
5,The best of Puzo was his last bestseller!,"A fine piece of fiction by the author of the Godfather! This weas his last book and I think it was his best and that is a hard thing to say because that ""The Godfather"" was so compelling! I could not put this down for one second. Great telling of the mafia sagas. His storytelling was so fantastic. it is sad that his life endede after this book was his last."
1,OMERTA--DOWNER,I read the GODFATHER . This is no GODFATHEr. Horrible and boring.too bad. I was drawn in by the author's name.
3,So-so Mafioso tale,"Mario Puzo again looking for gold after The Godfather fails to find it with Omerta.Puzo spins a yarn revolving around Astorre Viola, the protector of the family of Don Raymonde Aprile. Astorre is the late in life son of Don Zeno, the most powerful Don in Sicily, and his youthful wife who dies in childbirth. On his deathbed, Don Zeno entrusts the upbringing of his 2 year old son to the American, Don Aprile. Astorre is given a ""proper"" mafioso education as well as a high class formal one.Don Aprile retires from the ""business"" and is subsequently assassinated in a plot orchestrated by the FBI, NYPD and a rival Mafia don. The goal is to usurp control of the banks controlled by the Aprile family. Astorre becomes the protector of the Don's interests as well a his 3 grown and established children.Of course, Astorre seeks and gets revenge and the Aprile family lives happily ever after. Just a bit too tidy for my liking and there lies the major problem with this book."
2,disappointed,"To start off, this book falls way below the mark established by Puzo in the Godfather, Fools Die & the Sicilian (even The Last Don was a better read) in fact I found myself checking the cover of the book several times just to assure myself that this was indeed a Mario Puzo novel.With the exception of Asstore Viola the characters in this book were extremely flimsy, the ending was predictable and the entire book just had a ""thrown together at the last minute"" feel to it ,more like a novelization of a TV movie than a novel."
3,A Quick and Dissapointing Read,"I was thrilled to learn that we would get to read one last book by the great Mario Puzo. Unfortunately by the time I was done I almost wished that The Last Don had remained as the book that capped Puzo's career. Omerta reads more like an outline for a movie than a novel and the characters, while interesting, are painfully underdeveloped. It would be unfair to compare this book with The Godfather, so I won't bother, but even taken on it's own merits, Omerta can only be decribed as a dissapointment. It is a great story with great potential that is not met. Wait for the paperback."
4,The Sicilian Sound of Silence,"Anyone who has read Mario Puzo's Godfather and has clamored for the release of the three films on DVD, will not be disappointed with this tale. If you're a viewer of the Sopranos or just want entertainment, you will enjoy this book. But if you cannot appreciate the differences between Don Raymonde Aprile's family and Tony Soprano's, then you're missing the point.The characters, the locations and the details are all what you expect from a Puzo novel. The tale runs back and forth between the hill towns of Sicily with their simple lifestyles and traditions to the complexities of corporate law firms, FBI investigations and network television. Puzo's language is so descriptive about Sicily that you'll find yourself rereading certain passages to experience their flavor again and again. As you read the novel you will come to realize that Omerta was a way of life where secrets were kept or else."
2,Disapointing,"I was so happy on my way home with ""Omerta"" in a bag. Then I arrived, began to read, fell in dispair. The story has no rythm. No intrigue. Nothing. Just some characters with no logical behaviors. I'm so sad about it, because I loved the Godfhater and The Last Don."
2,Diminishing,"Let's stop the series here, it's slow paced, uneventful, anti climatic. Maybe one third of the previous ones"
4,Good book,"This was not Mario's best in my opinion. It was a good book though, don't get me wrong. I just didn't like the ending, it wasn't like the ""traditional"" Puzo ending, it was rather bland. The story line was interesting though, and had many twists. I would recomend it to anyone, just don't get your hopes up at the end."
1,"I read the Godfather, This is NO Godfather","This is the worst Puzo novel I have read. It is hard to believe that this is written by the same man who gave us Godfather, Sicilian, and Fourth K."
1,A Sad Failure,"This book is trash. As a long-time fan of The Godfather, I am only sad that this travesty was published. I cannot believe that Puzo himself wrote it. Cardboard characters, transparent cliche plot: A waste of time. Forget it!"
3,Enjoyable,"Mario Puzo has an extraordinary ability to entwine stories and beautifully draw the resulting plot together.The story is told from the characters contradictory viewpoints; I however expected a closer understanding and bond to be established with the individuals. I felt he did not penetrate the surface of their personalities, preferring to concentrate on the storyline."
3,The Final Edit,"Omerta reflects the tragic loss of Mario Puzo. With more time the characters would have become more real and more rounded. We may have cared about their fate and fortunes. Puzo was only able to project the beauty of Sicily, the richness of the soil and the smell of the olives. The settings are very real. Enjoy Omerta for that. Tolerate the flatness of the characters and their impact on the plot's weakness. Mario's final tribute would have been better with more time."
4,"Good read, but not Puzo's best work","As an avid reader with a fondness towards criminal literature, I found Omerta by Mario Puzo as an entertaining read. It's plot has it's ups and downs, but he managed to keep me interested and intrigued throughout the book. However, the plot and its outcome is overly-foreshadowed and the book becomes truly predictable in an almost negative way. However, if you enjoy Puzo's better works such as The Godfather and The Last Don, then I suggest Omerta is a good read, even if just for the entertaining nature and vivid imagery only Mario Puzo can conjure up."
3,The last but not the best,"This last book of Puzo was as many trilogies go, not as good as the first, and not as good as the second. The Godfather and The Last Don were very good reads - very capturing and political, but this one seemed to just go through the motions. If you liked the first two books, definately get this one, it's the last one you'll read from Puzo, but don't expect a bedazzeling Godfather. It's a good book none the less."
2,Altogether too snappy,"Did Puzo write this? Most of its chapters read like summaries of action, not like stories. I felt like it was on fast forward most of the time."
3,Least favorite of the Trilogy,"Ok,I know Mario Puzo could never top THE GODFATHER,and THE LAST DON held my reading attention,but this book for me had not enough of a story. There is the usual Mafia hits,and a couple of small surprizes,but overall I thought it dull."
3,"More like ""Gatsby"" than ""The Godfather.""","It isn't a novel; it's a screenplay, because it depends on the visual, not the narrative. This has been done before, by Dos Passos and F. Scott Fitzgerald, and when it is done well, it creates fast-paced action; when done badly, it produces thin characters with little motivation. That could be the case here, but I'm not sure, because I got the point. America has changed, again, and so have the wiseguys in it. Still, I have trouble believing that a ""man of respect"" could marry a woman that he had employed as a whore and decoy. Unless Puzo's point is that, finally, one don wised up enough to choose love over money and power! Read carefully; this book is more complex than it looks. It may have been written in haste, with one eye on the film rights, but so was ""The Great Gatsby,"" whose characters are minimalist, too, by design."
3,Unfortunately the last Puzo...,"I've read everything written from Mario Puzo (including The Godfather, The Last Don, and Fools Die) and I am very sorry to say that his last wasn't close to the same league of his other novels. It seems rushed at the end, and while the lean meat of the characters are there (and they are fascinating, vintage Puzo) they aren't nearly as fleshed out as you want them to be. I put down the book fairly unsatisfied. That being said, even his mediocre writing is better than most people's best efforts, and its definitely worth a read."
1,Very poor quality Puzo Book,"I can't believe this is the same author who wrote Godfather. The writing is weak and filled with cliche's. Very implausible, mildy interesting, ridiculous characters. None of the characters in this book seem real, the author did a poor job creating them. Mostly they are super characters able to do everything (the mark of a poor writer) or are just immoral and boring. The women are all [prostitute]..., the men are all tough, blah, blah. This is the kind of work I'd expect from Puzo if he were 14. I think its just an attempt to cash in on his name, rather than a serious attempt at a good story.I'd advise you not to waste your time with it."
2,Which name doesn't belong?,"a. Margaret Mitchell b. Harper Lee c. Mario Puzo Answer: c. Mitchell and Lee, each having written her magnum opus and realizing the small odds of ever producing another book to measure up to the first, wisely did not try. Puzo, on the other hand, has tried repeatedly to recapture the magic he possessed while penning The Godfather. I've read two of his efforts: The Fourth K and Omerta. Both fell far, far short of his masterpiece in terms of depth and breadth of plot, richness of characterization, and any other measure. It's a pity he wasn't as smart as Mitchell and Lee, who quit while they were ahead."
1,Publisher should be embarassed,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read! It seems as if it was written as an outline for the real book which was never published. There was no suspense, no character development, and never caused me to care one way or the other about any of the characters. It was an insult to anyone with an IQ higher than room temperature"
1,Terrible book!,I would give the book 0 stars if that was an option. The characters are a joke and the plot is too thin. I feel as if I was ripped-off in buying the book!
2,geez luis,"this book wasnt as fantastical as i thought it was going to be. I had heard puzo was a good writer so picked it up and got bored about three quaters the way through the first page. Im not saying not to read this ""novel"" but it might work better as a coffe table..."
3,"Good, but not good enough","I was quite hooked on this book as I read it, but I was left feeling unsatisfied at the end - it could have been so much better. I think other reviewers are right in suggesting that this was just a first draft, because the characters were terribly sketchy and I didn't get inside the heads of any of them - even the hero.The romantic ending was completely unbelievable and, consequently, very irritating."
2,"Can never be another ""Godfather""","Its again the same old story of dons where the successor takes over and reigns. In omerta the successor is the nephew instead of the sons. I think if you are fed up reading the mafia stories then this book is definitely not for youDon Raymonde Aprile gets murdered and he leaves the biggest junk of his property - The Bank, to the nephew Astorre viola instead of his own children. Astorre now takes the responsibility to find out the killers of his uncle and in the process tumbles over a huge conspiracy over the bank. And also in the process protects the children of the Don from the bad underworld, The Mafia.Nothing interesting, one could tell the story after the first few chapters."
2,Omerta,"A disaster for a Puzo novel. I read this book in under three days, but I was disappointed with it. The characters were too one-dimensional and the romance sub-plot was terrible along with the climax and ending which I thought came out of a cheap action film. What was Puzo thinking?? This book does not possess character depth necessary to make the story compelling. Its merely a shallow story that is predictable and not worthy of a premier writer. Its as if this was written to be a tv show with no character development. I had no trouble putting this book down. I could hardly believe I was reading a Puzo novel, it read more like a first attempt e-book. This book does not even compare to The Godfather or The Last Don. I must say I was very disappointed. It seemed like I was watching a cheap mob movie. As a big Puzo fan, I could tell that there was something lacking when he wrote this. I'm not saying I'm an expert, granted, I'm only sixteen, but really, he could have done better."
3,A ghost writer wrote the ending after Puzo's death,"I am a true fan of Puzo, and have read all of his books and enjoyed them, Fools Die, being the weakest to date, but Omerta built up superbly and was a great let down. I agree w/ another reviewer, things fit too well in the end. Also,the was no way possible Astorre could have planned the end to be as cute as it was. It ended like a made for tv movie."
3,It is OK,"It is not as good as The Family or God Father. Easy reading, but easily forgettable. I was slightly disappointed. It feels forced."
2,Slow Page Turner,I have read most of Mario Puzo's books and this is one of his least satisfying. I got the sense reading this book that Mr. Puzo had taken his stock plot lines and character types and plugged in different places and names and phoned in the result.
2,"Puzo, Going Through The Motions","Who wrote this? It reads like a Puzo pastiche, and I have a strong feeling that, as this was Puzo's last book, it was finished (if not significantly ghosted throughout) by someone else. It reads like a shadow of a shadow of ""The Godfather,"" a masterpiece of popular fiction. The plotting and characterizations are purest cardboard. A sad end to a frequently bright career. Not recommended-- read anything else by Puzo first."
1,Sad.,"If you're thinking this is as good as The Godfather or The Last Don, you're wrong! This is a very bad book. The characters are like cardboard, you don't even care for any of them. The fact is, it's just a bad book, and even The Fourth K is better than this!"
2,Pretty bad,"""Omerta"" is an unfortunate jumble of characters, tedious plot lines and lazy writing. The largely unoriginal mafia intrigue is appealing on some easy-reading level, but mostly everything about this book is phony, overwrought and dull. The most disappointing thing to me, a first-time Puzo reader, was that the characters did not have histories so much as they had stage personas. The smooth, calculating hero who can't bring himself to kill women. The vicious South American druglord who has the morals of a spider. The happy-go-lucky hitmen twin brothers who live like underworld yuppies but meet a terrible end. Trite, trite, trite."
2,Needed a good editor and rewrite,"After Mario Puzo died, he left Omerta as an unfinished novel. It is given to us in a largely unfinished form. With lots of inconsistencies and repetitive phrases, the book could have been at least polished by a good editor. The estate would have been well served to have hired a writer to develop the characters, now just flat 2-dimensional caricatures. The plotting is servicable and at times quite exciting. The novel could have lived up to promise had Puzo been alive."
1,Puzo?,"I'll never believe Mario Puzo wrote this story. I know he was severly ill for months before he died. I tend to think someone else wrote this story from Puzo's outline and drafts. The story is so weak, it's just not Puzo. I'm upset that I paid $25 for it! I kept reading and saying to myself that it was going to get better, but it never did."
4,In Tradition with Mario Puzo,"I have been reading the ""Omerta,"" and also I have been reading some of the critics thaT HAVE BEEN POSTED. i WONDER WHAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN READING. I have read the Godfather, Fools Die and The Fortunate Pilgrim and can attest to the similiarities in style and theme. Mario Puzo's voice is clearly heard through out Omerta. The family, the corporate and mafia similiarities, the conspiring, the revenge and selflessness of protecting the family. Michael Corleone took over the family business, he couldn't trust anyone, he made the tough choices that no one else seemed ready or had the capacity to make. Much like Astorre he was prepared for the purpose that other characters weren't prepare to make. It was his destiny to lead the family. These are similiarities in Puzo's writing just to name a few. I think this book is keeping with the tradition that Mario Puzo set in The Godfather. I will definitely miss his work."
4,Good Mafia book,I will always use The Godfather as my guide. This was good especially if you like Mafia books. The book does have a strange opening but probably typical for the Mafia. Lots of corruption....and lots of shoot'm up. I've read some books that are better...I've read some not as good.
4,Good read,"I give it four because despite its age, it is relevant in today's world. It's on of the books read my leaders like MLK Jr and Malcolm X. I see why they read it and it's influence in the actions recorded through history. It can be long winded at times though and some research was required to make sense of his references."
2,"Ordered new pump, Amazon shipped used pump.","I ordered a new tire pump, and received the shipment on time. But when I opened the box, there was a tire pump without factory packaging or a content list or a set of instructions. I lifted the pump out of the box and noticed the dirt on my hands. The product label on the tire pump was worn. I realized this was a used pump that Amazon sent me. This was unbelievable to me. How could their shipping department have sent me a used pump? The only packing material to protect the pump in shipping was a sheet of brown kraft paper. I might understand if this was the busy holiday season, but it is the middle of January.The pump itself might be in excellent working order. This review is to show my disappointment in the shipping from an Amazon warehouse. I wanted to make potential purchasers of this pump aware that they might be sent a used pump instead of a new one."
1,Broke on first try,"This is a terrible product. It broke the first time I tried to use it; the bottom cracked, letting the air escape, and rendering it useless. Don't waste your money."
4,Tire Pump,"Purchased the Airpower America 7500 volume tire pump as I was not able to get a replacement hose for the ""dated"" one I had.I am well pleased by this produce, especially it's capacity. It is of good quality and made in America.Airpower America 7500 Volume Tire PumpI would have given it 5 stars if it also had a readable pressure gauge attached."
1,This book is very disappointing.,"I was so excited to get this book! I thought: at last, new adventures with my favorite characters! What a disappointment. Not only is the premise ridiculous, but the characters are written as caricatures of themselves. Joel is only barely recognizable; do you really think he would close a letter with ""Yours in Chutzpah!""??? Would Chris end a note with ""Supremely Conscious""??? Please. Don't hit us over the head with it! Another irritant is the fact that whenever Joel, Maurice, or Holling sends a letter to a place of business, the personal address reads ""Gentlemen."" The Northern Exposure series was always exploring issues of gender with thoughtfulness and insight, but this book simply reiterates the cultural undertones of sexism. If you're a real Northern Exposure fan, don't waste your time on this book."
4,More adventures in Cicely.,"After spending many years wallowing in the fact that I was never going to get a new adventure with my friends in Cicely, Alaska, I come across this great book. Set at about the end of season 3, this book can practically be considered another episode. It's was an excellent read."
5,MOOrific!,This video is awesome! My son is 20 months old and has grown to love cows. He asks to watch this 2-3 times a week and will hold his attention for a good 15 minutes; long enough to get his cow fix. I HIGHLY recommend this product if your child is into cows. Totally worth the money!
2,Oh Wow Cows,My three year old who absolutely loves everything about cows does not like the video at all. A waste of money.
4,"a few duds, but very good selection overall","This is an old CD collection that i purchased used because i liked the Ryko presentation of Bowie's material. It's a pretty good selection overall, one big improvement would have been the original, hard to find version of Rebel Rebel (the faster version with the phased vocals, that he used on most subsequent live albums). Anyway, it's a good collection with no real surprises."
5,Incomparable,No other artist makes me feel the way David Bowie does. He is beyond words. An awesome compilation.
2,talk about over-rated,just because he had some great songs in the 70's and a few in the 80's doesn't make him out to be a legend.in fact he hasn't had a good good song in almost 20 years not since lets dance.it's been mainly image.his business smarts are ahead of the turn with the music bonds but his music nowadays just lacks any kind of substance.he writes and plays instruments and is the king of image make over but that hasn't got a thing to with the music.this to me is the only thing worth owning by this artist.he is a good stage act.
1,Some good songs but awful vocals.,"There are songs on this album that any artists would be proud to write. There are also vocals on this album that any artist would shoot himself over. Space Oddity, Starman, Heroes are all good songs, great(maybe) but Bowie`s singing is only comparible to that of Ian Brown`s of the Stone Roses. His seeming inhability to sing high or low notes is frustrating but why he chooses to talk himself through a song is beyong belief. He should have written the songs and sat back while someone else stood in the limelight."
3,Where are the incredible fights?,"The new generation is a great replacement for the old mechwarriors of the Gray Death Legion, mixing them with veterans like McCall just to spice things a little (McCall is too good to be missing). BUT, almost 3/4 of the book are just talk, and planning, and guessing, etc. I know all what surrounds a mech confrontation (I'm a player), and I don't need more than 200 pages to remind me. Where are the great fights that draw our hearts to the Gray Death Legion? Except for Davis Clay, the rest are just faceless warriors. And to make things worst, the book does not end, and doesn't tell you where is the second part (by the way, does somebody know so I can buy it?) If you want to know all the activities that surround a mech battle (in detail, I assure you), read it, if not, well, is better to grab a board and a couple of dice and start blowing away some armor."
4,Hooray for the 4th Lousiana!,"It is about time someone published a book about this State-loyal Southern regiment. This is a very interesting book for those wishing to follow a Confederate regiment raised outside of Virginia, and fighting in the Civil War in armies other than in the Army of Virginia. Yes, many, many battles were fought outside of Virginia and the men involved on both sides fought just as hard, bled just as much and died just as hard as in the Virginia battles.My only concern about this book is the inclusion of non-documented or foot-noted quotes and actions attributed to some of the participants. Many footnotes, when the source is reviewed relate to the over-all fact of a battle, but they don't relate to a particular described action or to what is said. While these activities or sayings certainly may have happened (they do add excitement to the scene), it would be ideal to include a source reference."
3,Interesting and unfulfilling.,"This book is not a bad one by any means. The oddity of the various identities/meanings of the character are intriguing as well as the search for the truth of what happened. The way the various events are tied and and switched about to make, in essence, three stories is nice. However, all I really left with from the book is a bit of a hollow feeling. Too much ambiguity to find answers, and too little depth to find fulfillment. Perhaps I read too fast or overlooked the point, but to me it was simply a good writer flexing his literary muscles for show."
4,cute and something different,"These cards are very cute and will give my daughter something different to do. She isn't even two yet and understands what to do with them, but she does get a little frustrated. So, I will put these up for now and bring them out again in a couple of months. The cards do seem to be pretty durable and this will help develop fine motor skills."
4,Make sure you have plenty of reading time,From the beginning - the telling of the curse on to Clara's reaction of Tyree - to the end you are swept into this story and won't have a Ghost of a Chance of putting this book down. This one is a definite keeper.
5,"""Word Pictures""","I she hadn't alluded to the fact she is also a painter, I would have guessed it from reading this very descriptive memoir.Ms Marwitz is to the written word what Smetana is to tone poems: I had the feeling I could reach out and touch the people, the land and especially Nasim, a person I would very much like to have known.Most writers separate time periods by creating chapter headings, but Caroline Marwitz does it seamlessly, so instead of reading, one gets the feeling she is sitting in front of you, telling you her life experiences, and that kind of writing doesn't come along very often.I totally enjoyed this book and look forward to more of her works."
3,Not for everyone,"I bought this book to learn more about Jackie Robinson's baseball career. I assumed that would be the major focus. Unfortunately, by the time the book is half-way through, Jackie has retired from baseball and moved on to other things.The rest of the book focuses on Jackie's various projects, jobs, associations, etc, mainly revolving around civil rights issues. There are a couple of heartbreaking chapters that detail the issues he had with his son, Jackie Jr.All-in-all, this is worth reading but not quite what I was looking for."
3,"A Solid Book, But Disappointing Nonetheless","Jackie Robinson's autobiography is good, yes, but I expected much more from it. A person like Robinson has a great story and should have been able to produce a book that would knock you out of your chair. Unfortunately, Robinson spends more than half the book talking about what he did after his career was over. He should have spent at least 3/4 of the book on his playing days. Instead, he'd rather tell you about running a bank in Harlem. This isn't a bad read, but it should have been better."
1,"Distasteful, obscene, offensive... normal people avoid it!","This book was incredibly distasteful. The title offers a completely different idea of what you expect and what you get. If you desire a book aimed at completely disfunctional people, this book is the one. It leaves you feeling that the world is one big immoral, disfunctional bunch of morons. If you crave a book for help with your sex life... look else where. A complete waste of perfectly good, hard earned money."
4,Great book!,"This book gives a lot practical and accurate info - a lot of stuff I already knew, but it's good to see it explained in detail (and my boyfriend needed to read it, anyway). I highly recommend it to people who want to open up communication and improve their sex life. Some of the birth control info isn't 100% accurate (such as saying the cervical cap isn't good for people prone to UTIs, it's just the opposite), but she seems to have a handle on most of the sexual pleasure info."

4,Poe: More Tales of Mystery and Imagination by Eric Woolfson.,"After waiting a log time for a 2nd. part to be taped, I would have liked it more in the style of the 1st. part. Yet it was very well thought out, as-well-as in its execution. I would recommend it to any fans of the ""passe"" Allan Parsons Project,or of Edgar A. Poe himself. It's a different, & interesting listen."
3,Poe--a review,"Eric, oh Eric... You are a genius but tried too hard with this one! Some of the music is marvelous, but most is either pedestrian or just downright bad. Steve Balsamo helps some, but not enough to keep this from really being a train wreck.Needs Alan's engineering. And if not Alan's, somebody beside yourself or one that won't listen to you.I was disappointed. Very disappointed."
3,Beware of Misadvertisement !!!,"The long awaited follow up, for Alan Parsons Project fans, to the 1976 masterpiece ""Tales of Mystery and Imagination"" is a disappointment IF you are expecting it to be anything like the original. This follow-up album is clearly designed to be a musical. A few of the songs are soft rock at best, but as the CD plays out, it is clear that Woolfson is still aiming for the theatre. The music is alright, very mellow, but it left me wishing that he would've collaborated with Alan on this one."
4,Another Coupe for Stein Fans,"Robert Stein has written another exciting story that will hold you from the first line to the end. He's rapidly becoming a force in suspense publishing, and with reason."
4,Used It For Class!,"I use this book for my International Business class in college and it has become a second bible for me. There are detailed examples and countless explanations of all the necessary forms and permits as well as rules and regulations are all included in an easy to understand format. If you ever wanted to know the in's and out's of importing/exporting, if you've always wanted to start your own side business as an importer or simply if you are a student in any type of Business class then this book IS a must."
1,Biblical solutions to personal problems,This book has an intriguing title but unless you believe in biblical solutions to personal problems it will probably be of little interest. It is a highly religious oriented book.
5,Great service.,Book arrived quickly and in wonderful shape. It is like new- even has the author signature! Thanks for taking care of this.
4,The best that can be expected from a small booklet,"Many a pocket calculator is larger than this booklet and with 88 pages it didn't take me much more than an hour to read.Then again: it does put a lot of information in the little space available and virtually all of that is spot-on. Also the selection of topics is exactly that which is needed on a first reading.At the moment where I write this (April 2002), some of the info out of the 2000 edition already seems to be referring to a totally different era. Menem no longer is president and neither is his succesor (or his sucessor for that matter). The times where foreignors were desparate to get into the market and Argentines could dictate terms today seem a distant memory too.Don't let that put you off from buying this book. If you want to obtain a Ph.D. on Argentology, a small volume like this is insufficient. But if you have a (business) interest in Argentina and would like to get to know the essentials fast, this is the book to buy."
1,Access is for Mom & Pop and Bowling databases,"Some of the information is great but overall, dont waste the money on any of these books. READ THEM IN THE STORE AND TAKE NOTES. DONT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY."
3,Decent Primer but incomplete as a reference,"I have been dissappointed with this book. This book may be helpful to understand the tutorials on the supplied CDROM but does little to help expand one's skills beyond this basic level. I bought this book with the hope that I could use it as a reference to transfer my skills with other database management tools (FileMakerPro, FoxBase) to Microsoft Access. While basic concepts are covered in a tutorial style, I often found myself wanting a comprehensive function reference in order to move beyond the example databases in developing my own projects. Often, functions and concepts are listed without any indication of their syntax or how they are used...and many are simply overlooked."
3,Good beginners book.,"I received this book as part of the Microsoft Mastering Series... in this context it was a dissapointment. Generally, the book is good for anybody starting out, but for those that have done any programming work in Access at all then look somewhere else."
2,"Poor Training Kit: Online Tutorial & ""Running Access 2000""","The accompanying computer-based tutorial (not the books own CD) would be MUCH more useful in book format, so that single-PC trainees won't have to either split windows or frequently switch between Access and tutorial. The tutorial's content is cookbook -- and worthwhile for beginners like me. Once one finishes the tutorial, one quickly finds that the ""Running Access..."" book is clearly a reference and not a training guide. Unfortunately, the tutorial does not provide sufficient practice for the trainee to only need a reference book. Recommendation: For trainees, find a more comprehensive training resource. I'm now buying Alison Balter's ""Mastering Access 2000 Development"" book, wishing I had started there."
3,Achebe's Things Fall Apart,"Things Fall Apart, by Chinua Achebe, was somewhat entertaining and interesting, but at some points seemed boring and dull. The first of the three parts was what I thought was most interesting. Okonkwo's rise from poverty and strong work ethic drew me into novel. Some of the chapters during this part seemed out of place to me though and thus made it dull. When things start falling apart in Okonkwo's world, Achebe begins to tell two stories at once. I liked reading about Okonkwo's struggles and at the same time seeing how the English missionaries were changing his world as a whole. I do believe Achebe's novel is rather predictable and at some points boring, but overall descent. The ending may catch you by surprise."
5,Excellent Introductory overview,"Excellent book for technical professionals looking to go deeper into video. All the relevant protocols and technologies are surveyed, and enough detail is provided to give an understanding of their relevance. Highly recommended - this will point you to the areas to explore in more depth if you need to go further."
3,"OK, for levi's","The wash on these jeans isn't as faded or dark as I would have liked, or the image indicated. Also, they do not have the adjustable waist that I love with growing boys, but perhaps that's something that goes away with sizes 8-20. All and all, decent for the spend."
1,Please stop the faux finishes,I want blue Levis with no fake creasing and wear. It is SO cheesy and sloppy - my kid will break them in just fine on his own.
5,A great gift,"My husband's favorite cologne was Giorgio Red. He wore it for years till it was discontinued. Now, apparently it is back and I was thrilled to find it for sale on Amazon. It made a perfect present. I think the scent is a little bit different from what it used to be, but it still makes a man smell really good."
3,Always check cost of postage,Have been shocked with prices of postage. Fragrance is great buy wasnt worth paying 6 times the amount for postage. My faultfor not investigating.
4,Red by Giorgio Beverly Hills,"I thought this cologne was discontinued. I was surprised to find it so cheap in an Amazon.com warehouse. It smells mostly of alcohol when you first spray it on, but the true smell eventually comes through. Perhaps it is many years old just sitting in a warehouse somewhere? Still, I think I found a great deal on a cologne I can't find in stores."
1,Not a good spray at all,"I brought this item some months back but never really used it. Today when i sprayed it on my new White Tee Shirt, it left yellowish stains.I thought it will evaporate in some time but it did n't . This left me very annoyed. Please beware if you are using on light clothes."
5,Red by Giorgio Cologne for men,"This cologne is very difficult to find online and impossible to find in stores. Great price, fast shipping, product as advertised. I'll buy again."
5,Red By Giorgio review,My favorite. Just like it! Will continue buying it and would definitely recommend to a friend as long as they keep making it.
4,Purchased as a gift,"The item came, unsealed as promised. I can't say more because I won't be the one testing it. But,I have no complaints either"
2,"I thought, based on the picture that I was getting a higher wattage bulb","I was disappointed by this item as I was expecting 60 watts, based on the picture for the listing. I really needed a warming bulb and didn't have time to go to the pet store for a replacement."
1,Buld died after 2 weeks of use!,this product did not last. the bulb bernt out within 2 weeks of very minor use.lss that 4 hours of use!
4,Interesting and entertaining,"This book is good for research or just for personal interest. It covers customs, superstitions, games, and recipes of a variety of festivals and feasts, including St Valentines Day, Shrovetide, Whitsun, Harvest, Hallowe'en, among others. Thorough, and also good for children, as it includes ideas for projects, such as making straw dollies or a May Pole. Worth looking for."
2,Blotched,"This product did seem to work in my Canon printer for about a week. After this, I was on the second black ink when ""blotches"" started appearing along the right side of the printouts and then in the middle. I contacted Canon and was told that ""compatible"" ink can cause this and referred me to a service center to see if I could pay $60 to have the printer serviced."
5,Festive Trifle Dish!,What a festive trifle dish...beautiful piece to add to the collection. I made a Paula Dean trifle for Xmas and besides the trifle being delicious the dish just made it complete!! (Got lots or rave's too on both)It's not real heavy which I like and just the perfect size. For the price this is wonderful!
5,niche coverage of WWII,"WWII is a fascinating subject. From the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact, to Germany's secret missile program, to the Manhattan project, the era is packed full of fascinating and often horrific stories of innovation. The story told by Skeeter Beaters is an example of the fascinating. What's great about Skeeter Beaters is that this is a story I hadn't heard before. There's no movie starring John Wayne or Tom Hanks, and not many bullets screaming over the head of the protagonist. Nonetheless, this is a story that should be told. As the editorial review already says, the US was losing many more men to disease than to combat with the Japanese. The US Navy showed good old American innovation by putting a team together assigned to fight the problem. This is the story of that team, and I'm happy that it has been told."
3,Not completely Perfect for me,I just finished reading this book and Id have to say that it wasnt at all what I was expecting. I found to be a little simple. Almost too simple. The plot was a bit easy to guess at. The books basic line for romance was pretty good it was just the inbetween stuff that seemed to drag the story on. I really dont think Im going to continue to read the second one. Finishing the first one didnt leave me wanting to find out what happens next.
5,A Fun Romantic Read,"This book was very sweet, modern, and fun. It is about a girl named Madison who is running for school president. One problem: her arch enemy is the person running against her. Where does she find her comfort? In the funny and charming Blue, her partner in the ""computer pal"" program at school. She is suprised to find herself falling for someone she never even met. But, it is more suprising finding out who he is.This book was full of morals, misunderstandings, and romance. It was also different from other teen romance novels I've read. Now I won't go that far and say it was original, but it was different. Most teen romance has sex in some part or another. This book shows affection and love without having to prove it through sex.If it had to have a flaw I would have to say the ending was predictable. But, it is made up in the charm and comedy of the book. I highly recomend it!"
2,Not a good design,"We purchased these gates after being pleased with the purchase of some other Summer Infant products. I am an experienced carpenter and installed these gates exactly per the instructions. The latch mechanism of this gate is a fundamentally bad design. First, the latch really can't be operated with one hand-- you need one to press the latch lever at the same time you need to use the other hand to lift up the gate at the hinge side (using a significant amount of force). The gate is also very loud when it closes-- you need to use a lot of force to engage the latch. Not a good design if you are carrying a baby or have a sleeping baby around."
4,Nice and sturdy,"This gate works great and is solid as a rock. The trick is making sure you screw the gate into a stud. If you don't have studs, I wouldn't use the weak, cheap, plastic mollies (anchors) that come with the gate. I would highly recommend you get 4 of those big metal screw type augers that hold 50-lbs. They will support the gate especially if the gate is extended to 40+ inches. Also take your time installing the clips on the opposite side, make sure they line up with the gate so that when you swing the gate closed it just clicks right into the clips by itself. I only gave this item 4 stars because the directions suck and could have been made much more clearer. Luckily this product is not too hard to figure out how to install it. I highly recommend this gate for pets or toddlers."
1,My two year old can pull this gate open.,"This gate is fine for infants, but is worse than useless for toddlers. My two year old pulls on it (back and forth), and it pops open; sometimes, it smacks him in the face. This is due to the design of the latch.The screws that come with it are also of poor quality; the heads sometimes bust off even if you you have drilled a pilot hole.Considering the cost to purchase and work involved to insall, plus screw-hole damage to walls and banisters, this is a very poor value."
1,Poor Design,This gate is so poorly designed and way too heavy. Unless this is going into a stud it won't work. The latching mechanism is cheap plastic. We had to put this in an area without a stud and had to use larger screws and anchors. Even after that it was still too heavy so we used toggle bolts. Even after this its still too heavy and I'm afraid it's going to come off the wall!! Taking off and going right back to the store and purchasing a better one. Will be willing to pay more for less hassle. Very disappointing. Gave it one star only because I had to give it something.
5,Did the trick nicely!,"We got this to prevent our two furbabies from accessing the upstairs. It was pretty easy to install and works great. I love the fact that it is adjustable and also has a stop to not swing over the stairs. It may not keep a ""Marly"" contained but my Fox/chi and MinPin are well contained."
3,Mixed views,"I've had this computer for over two years now and there are a few big issues.Pros-It's lasted longer than any other computer that I've had.-With proper upgrades [only to the video card/fan/hard drive], it can play all of my games on medium/high settings with 60fps.Cons-the cd drive/dvd drive are very cheaply made. The covers of both have broken off, and the CD portion rarely even opens.-the default hard drive is horrible, crashing after a few months and costing me about 60gb worth of important data [and nearly a point on my GPA]-the default fan cannot handle any upgrades to video cards, replace it as soon as you can-I'm no expert on the inner-workings of computers, but trying to install a new video card was utter hell due to the mass of wires inside.-even though it's apparently twice as fast hardware-wise as my laptop, the laptop performs far better after 3 or 4 hours of playIn all, it's a good computer if you are looking for a long term commitment, but the costs will add up quickly."
5,GOOD TOY!!!!,This toy is pretty cool! It has simmilar articulation as the 500th Darth Vader action figure. It has a good sculpt and check out under the cloak seriously! Under the cloak he has some sort of mandalorian armor!!!!!!!!
2,The information is based on the '70's living,"It was an interesting perspective by Bill but as I continued to read, I knew his view was when ""times were good.""I read some and then decided the book wasn't worth reading in earnest."
4,Our Gramma travels too,"We were introduced to this book and now need one of our own. The tune is lovely, and I recommend getting tape to learn it. Our Gramma travels the world too, and when we read the book it seems to be about her. We are going to make up new verses for other places she has traveled, but it will be hard to match the wonderful rhymes in this book."
5,Coronado was here first,"I loved this book. It is a terrific introduction to the Spanish Conquest. I now live in the West, but was raised in the East. It's true - the winners get to write history. I never knew much about Coronado or the Spanish in shaping our country, but Coronado was here in what is now the US long before Jamestown or Plymouth Rock. Preston moves back in forth between the history of the Southwest and his experience retracing Coronado's trail in the present. He was both incredibly foolish to make the trip and incredibly lucky to have survived it. It is a fascinating book."
3,If you like Coronado...,"Interesting idea - retrace the route of Coronado through the American southwest.But in practice this turned out to be cringeworthy! The author probably wouldn't play Russian roulette, but he gambled lives (human & horses & dogs) on the slim chance that just maybe they'd find water in the middle of the desert before they died. Turns out they always did, but there were three bullets in that Russian roulette 6-shooter, and it could easily have gone either way.This is a very depressing book. In the past, desert civilizations arose that offered prosperity - only to have psychopaths come by and kill and enslave everyone, and destroy the civilization, leaving only desert.And again, in 1992, on this expedition, horses & dogs this time were just tools to be used, not sentient beings that had their own rights to life. Some horses fall off a cliff or die of thirst while you're writing your book? Bummer!Interesting story, but awful, too."
5,Pure Gold,"Reading a book twice is a rarity for me. But this book was worth both the investment (I bought one for myself, one for a friend) and the time. Having lived in and explored most of Arizona through backpacking, hiking, and horse trekking, I found Douglas Preston's recounting of his adventure to be both a delight and a thoughtful read.Anyone who has experienced the difficulties and beauty of nature first hand, will benefit from this book. All horse lovers will find themselves and their fleet-footed friends well depicted in Preston's travails. And those who simply want to learn more about the Southwest, its original inhabitants, the Spanish conquest and the impact of civilization on this fragile landscape and doomed people will want to explore Preston's sensitive, well-documented exposition. His final observations on our future are prescient and a warning: we, too, may go the way of the Zuni, Navajo, conquistadores and ranchers."
4,Funny and informational historical travelogue by horseback t,"Douglas Preston wrote an engagingly funny but also historical account of his adventures and misadventures following Coronado's trail by horseback from the Mexican border in SE Arizona northeast to Pecos, NM. His anecdotes are entertaining and his historical accounts describe the region and peoples past and present accurately.It's a must read for people interested in southwestern history."
5,Fantastic Reading!!,"This is a great book for anybody interested in what is happening in the Southwest.The author retraces Francisco de Coronado's journey in search for the city of Cibola.The author gives a great account of his journey and he even makes us feel like we are in the trip with him, i even felt so thirsty on a couple of occasions that i had to get up and get a glass of water.The book is really good because once in a while, Mr Preston stops his account of the trip and explains situations that were developing in the Southwest as well as an account of Coronado's journey.This book was a real page turner for me and a fantastic informative reading."
1,Bummer,"While I received the book in reasonable time, I have to say I was extremely disappointed in the book itself. I was hoping for a book that would provide lots of photos of current day decorating incorporating the Victorian style, like the photo shown on the cover. This is more of a text book. I couldn't tell that from the description when I purchased it. Maybe I didn't read it close enough?"
4,Sturgis video review,"This video is well organized, it has some colorful characters,but could use more. They keep it clean and not full of interviews of a bunch of drunks. Stormy Daniels does a good job of giving a documentery of activities. The women interviewed I think get to talk the most, guys just shrug and party on most of the time, normal. I think they could have did more on the activities on Main street and colorful characters along the drag. Not X rated at anytime, some boobs. Good video."
2,"Fair... but get the ""Just Say Yes"" series instead","The ""Just Say Yes"" series, from 1987-1994 provides a better cross-section, and more rarities than this boxset. The series was an annual sampler of the label's artists. This is somewhat akin to a sampler of those samplers..."
4,When punk was new wave + college radio went alternative...,"...the Sire label was in the forefront, the label one could trust to deliver the goods. Listening to this anthology you'll hear many old friendly tunes by groups who are now forgotten and others that continue on. Like any collection there are favorites missing and other songs included one wished weren't--but that's a norm one expects. There was a time when this music, the stable of Sire signings, wasn't played on top 40 radio, it was usually found lower on the FM dial played by college stations. And never played at ""the clubs,"" I was lucky to live in the San Francisco area where late at night on KSAN it was featured and one could go to a club called X's and pogo the night away. What these three (Sire, Ksan + X's) had in common is Howie Klein + I am thankful to him. ""Thank you Howie!"" This anthology is gonna be BIG fun, fun, fun."
3,"Some obscure, underground, and virtually unknown music & artists","The title said it all. It shouldn't be this hard to enjoy music but this is a bit of soulless junk for the most part for me. This isn't to say there isn't talent here, there sure is and I sometimes wish my musically taste was wider but we are what we are.Of course no collect is without its moments. I'll admit I've never like anything by The Ramones and nothing here changes that.The DVD has 20 music video's but the quality of this media is suspect as a number of the tracks seem to be extracted from second-hand video tape (maybe my DVD player?). Erasure, Madonna, The Pretenders and Barenaked Ladies are better served here.Maybe this collect will grow on me before it's put away..."
5,Suffocation,I remember seeing this band play live and it was awesome. I had no idea what they were singing but still enjoyed them. I had this cd laying around in a folder for awhile now. I got Abomination Reborn stuck in my head for some unknown reason so I played the cd. I was blown away as I listened to this awesome cd. Not a weak track on this entire cd and I highly recommend it too death metal fans. Suffocation is a excellent death metal band and one of the founding pioneers. Its too bad they are being shoved aside for bands that arent as good.
3,Underwhelmed,"Like Souls to Deny, this album has some great moments, and it's still better than 99% of everything else out there. But by Suffocation's previous standards, it's disappointing. Their guitar tone is once again weak and harsh. They used to sound heavier and clearer. Mike Smith's drumming is not as interesting as it used to be. The writing keeps getting simpler, less intriguing. Some of their riffs (like on the last album) sound like recycled variations of some of their older riffs. And other riffs sound altogether random and uninspired.I'm not a hater. I'm a fan. In fact, they're still my favorite death metal band. That's why I'm underwhelmed with this release."
5,Another Great Effort from the NY Death Leaders,"2006 has been an above-average year for veteran metal acts' new albums. Celtic Frost put out a great comeback record. Slayer made their first solid record since 1990. Deicide, whose last few records were never better than fair, returned with a new lineup and the front-runner for best death metal album of 2006, ""The Stench Of Redemption"". Now comes Suffocation's self-titled 2006 album. This album is exactly what you expect from the New York death merchants. While it is not up to the heights of 1995's magnum opus Pierced From Within, I really enjoy this album much more than Souls To Deny. I would definitely rate this a solid tie for 2nd best Suffocation album with the 1998 EP Despise The Sun which isn't a full-length. Best songs include ""Redemption"" and ""Bind, Torture, Kill""."
1,Another rip-off in the name of Jazz,"Too many producers are getting away with murder by fobbing off the public with statements such as 'the historical nature of the material is such that despite ...............'The picture and sound is extremely poor and one can definately live without having this one in their collection.It has some use though. I find that the dvd makes an excellent coaster for glasses and even hot drinks, as well as being a conversation piece."
1,20 seconds of roland kirk and the rest very poor audio junk,"totally misrepresented, it is an amateur video so poorly done and full of scenes having nothing to do with the music UNADULTERATED CRAP SHAME ON AMAZON FOR EVEN SELLING THIS GARBAGE"
3,"Poor Quality, Great Music","The sound and picture quality of this DVD is almost unbearable, but the music rocks! Only time I've seen a video of Roland Kirk and all his horns. Ellington and Hodges excel as always. Basie and his orchestra swing mightily. And to see BOTH Jimmy Rushing and Joe Williams belting out ""Goin' to Chicago"" -- outstanding!!"
1,This film stinks to high heaven,I reiterate my review of the VHS version of this disaster. IT IS TERRIBLE. If I could give 0 stars I would. For those who are thinking of buying the DVD check out the reviews for the VHS version first. It will be an eye-opener. For the company to put this junk also on DVD is beyond belief. It should be dropped in the nearest landfill and forgotten.
3,"Nice, not exceptional","I had high hopes for Donald Kagan's history of the Peloponnesian War. My anticipation was fueled by my interest in the topic, the author's reputation and the reviews written by other readers. Unfortunately, the last two points failed me.Professor Kagan does a nice job moving through the events leading to the war and the chronology of the war. What frustrated me was the uneven analysis, from excellent (the Peace of Nicias) to trite (the irrationality of Pericles' entering the war based honor instead of reason - Kagan treats these as if they are wholly separate; bad philosophy from the good professor) in topics that he is the expert.Overall, I have found other books on similar topics (ie. J.F.C. Fuller's ""Alexander the Great"") more interesting and informative."
4,CD reading of Peloponnesian War,Thucydides work is still the best but this history is gripping. It actually makes the ancient text more coherent. The voice of the reader is clear and soothing. I have read a lot of CD books; this is one of the best.Thomas W. Duda
2,Not a fun read,"I picked up this book after hearing an interview with the author on NPR. My interest in this era of Greek history is a recent one, sparked by an excellent documentary on The rise and fall of Sparta on the History Channel. So I'm a true layman. Kagan fails to make the story of the war fun to read. The narrative is dry, the descriptions too factual. I'm not sure what the audience for the book is. For instance, Kagan doesnt bother describing daily life in Athens or Sparta. So as a casual reader I have no idea what this war did to ordinary people, what was the effect on lives, how did people cope with the upheaval. I recently read books on the making of the atomic bomb by Richard Rhodes and evolution by Jonathan Weiner and both managed to take a difficult and dry subject and make reading about it a joy (both won the Pulitzer Prize). I wish someone would do the same for this subject."
2,"Dull, dull, dull...","This is a great book for those desirous of a single volume reference to the Peloponnesian War. All the facts are here, and the maps are excellent and numerous. As an entertainment, though, forget it. Kagan is obviously bent on providing a simple, relatively brief history (short chapters make for easy reading), but his writing style is so pedestrian and bereft of passion that it is a challenge maintaining your interest. Every page reads like the bare bones summary of an interesting story, one that I'd like to read a good book about some day. But Kagan is definitely no story-teller. Anyone looking for an engaging, immersive read might want to pass on this one."
2,V7.5 not intuitive,"I've designed some simple pages over the years from share and freeware programs, the last using Namo Webeditor V4. I thought I was beyond the noob position but this program put me right back at the beginning.After importing an already existing site, it inserted a template format over all the pages. (Hand smacking forehead) While this option can probably be turned off or adjusted, I am forced to dive into help menus to understand the ""characteristics"" of this program.Maybe version 7 was simple to use. I have tried working with V7.5 for the past couple months and have not been satisfied with the integration of the features. It does have some nice aspects but if I have difficulty doing simple stuff, the complex features don't matter.To me this has a moderate learning curve. I'm tired of trying to figure out the thinking behind NetObjects Fusion V7.5 and will keep searching for another web page development program. :("
1,Difficult to use,"Having read many of the reviews, I believe that the high ratings given to this product are given by people who are already using Net Objects products or have experience in building sites.Never having built a site or used any program like this, I find Fusion difficult to use and the help available is poor at best. The ""Getting Started"" book is very limited and the ""Help"" that comes on the cd is hardly helpful. Many times, the help section simply states what can be done with the software rather than describing how to do it. I have contacted the ""Support"" at Net Objects only to receive conflicting answers to the same question.I have been trying to learn Fusion for two weeks now and have yet to figure out how to change a background on a site page.This software is very frustrating and in no way easy to use."
2,I Hate This Program!,"I bought this program based on the reviews that it recieved on Amazon.com, but I wish I would have investigated further! The program is easy to use and the graphics are different. But, While working on my website with this program I lost weeks worth of work because of some glitch in the programming. The first time I lost evrything that I saved. Everything was just gone when I opened it the next time. After starting over from scratch, I lost everything a second time when it saved all my pages as My Home page. I lost my photo galleries and everything else! I do not reccomend this for some one with a low tolerance for frustration!"
1,This is the worst program ever written for web authoring,I've been using this programs since release 2I bought 2 3 4 5 and 7 and have recently updated withthe latest patches and STILL its got more bugs than an anthillI've just trashed itit totally refuses to even import single pages that that display fine in IE6 ... pages it created in the same version of itself !!!It refuses to even import its own .nod project files created just 12 months agoI've now lost 4 entire web sites because I assumed having backups of this things project files would keep them safethey cant or wont provide fixes and despite 7 attempts to get them to stop they keep spamming my email addressavoid this company and its projects like the plaguetry dreamweaver it may be more complicated but at least it doesnt keep trashing your workit took these people 6 releases to even get the HTML <center> command to work correctlyjust amazingly bad in every respect for anything other than simple 1 or 2 page sites with nothing on them
1,Don't Bother,"This is a terrible item. Although it is fairly easy to use the item suffers because it is restrictive in that it only allows you to automate uploadig if you use an NOF server, and they can range from $80.00 to over $100.00 annually"
1,Inappropriate CD Cover!,"At first blink, Diana Krall's presentation of herself as the ""yuletide floozy"" seems to be an inappropriate choice for a Christmas cd. Then, it occurred to me that Jesus came to save us from our sins. Nonetheless, this image of Diana Krall at Christmas prevents me from adding this cd to my Christmas collection."
3,"Insulting and gatuitous, but great music","I have never bought any Diana Krall music. I have a friend that has every release and I have heard some. Enough to make me think about buying some myself but I can't seem to get over the insulting manipulation. I enjoy a looker as much as the next guy and Diana is certainly that. But this picture on a Christmas collection is the ultimate in misguided manipulation. Instead of getting me to buy the CD, I decided not to just because of it. Mostly because I feel that they were attempting a cheap come on to get superficial people to make the leap. Well, I'm insulted by that."
3,"All traditional songs, too short","I found the diversity of previous reviews most interesting. All of the songs on this recording are very familiar Christmas songs. I found the arrangements to be good, and enjoyed the fact that Diana's voice was clear and not covered up by the orchestration. I am always disappointed by recordings that use up only a fraction of the capacity of a CD -- in this case, 45 minutes. I don't think we pay only 60% of the price. I would have liked at least one or two less common songs."
5,Tasteful for holiday parties,"I bought this CD as I searched for Christmas music that wasn't cheesy to play during a holiday cocktail party. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed it - especially because of what was not on the recording, namely the trumpet falsetto horse sound on Sleigh Ride. Just smooth and sexy background music appropriate for singles in the city."
3,A Torch Singer's Christmas,"This is a pretty classic torch singer, with great pipes, singing Christmas songs. Put it on your CD with a few other Christmas albums you love, hit random and you'll never be disappointed when Krall's songs come up. When you just listen to the album by itself it becomes a little much..."
1,Dissenting view,"Well, I disagree with most of these reviews. I own all of Ms Krall's cds and this is, I believe, her poorest. Her voice is so coarse and so often off key in these arrangements that I felt compelled to listen carefully to a couple of her early cds as a reality test. The same vocal issues are there too in the beginning, but just a little bit. Her voice has changed to my ear, and not for the better. And that little bit in the earlier cds is covered up by her solid, swinging piano, which clearly gets her into the music--her brio carries the day. Not here. A real disappointment."
4,Thanks Diana for fabulous Christmas album!,"I ordered Ms. Krall's 'Live in Paris' CD at the same time. The differences between that and this Christmas album were striking. While the Paris tracks were wonderfully energetic, Diana seemed to be having a bad day vocally. Was it jet lag, to much exposure to cigarette smoke, something else? Whatever, her tired, haggard vocal tone ruined the disc for me.OTOH, the obvious studio Christmas effort was apparently with a rested voice. While I can't offer enough praise for her musicanship (I really love Jazz vocalists who also instrumentalists), her voice is the least impressive of here music assests, to me lacking in breath support. But on the Christmas album it is in good enough shape to not be a problem. The big band arrangements are to-die-for.Bottom line - purchase Paris disk forewarned. And do not hesitate to pick up the Xmas album."
3,Overwhelmed by the arrangements?,"I love Diana and her voice. But this outing doesn't do it for me. I prefer her being out in front like on Love Scenes or When I Look in You Eyes. To me her previous big band outing, Look of Love, suffered in the same way -- great photos, weak rhythm. She just sounds too constrained to me when she's following the big band. I don't know how they recorded this, but if the recorded the strings before Diana's voice, my suggestion would be to record Diana and a small combo first, and THEN record the strings. Let her swing a bit. Let her follow her own beat. Don't tie her down! Let the people in the monkey suits follow her, not vice-versa. While Beethoven and Bach may have allowed improvision in classical music, classical musicians forgot how to swing and improvise a couple hundred years ago!"
3,If that's what you want...,"I bought this as a Christmas present for someone else and I think he liked it...I, on the other hand, did not. I just don't think she's very special in terms of her voice, her style, her phrasing...anything really. She is a beautiful woman and looks great on the cover, but you have to like listening to classic songs getting revamped for no reason."
2,Not her best genre,"I'm a big fan of Diana Krall and can recommend her jazz albums and her concerts very highly. But she needs to stick to jazz standards and torch songs where her smoky voice and sultry execution are highlighted. With perhaps a couple of exceptions, she seems uncomfortable with. . .something. . .on most of these Christmas standards. I don't know if it's because they don't lend themselves well to jazz interpretation and almost require one to sing them in the sing-song, strictly metered rhythms, or what it is about her delivery on these, but the album is a disappointment for the most part. I bought it because of the recommendations on Amazon, but I'm afraid this one is headed for the donation bin after Christmas is over."
1,Does it sound tinny to you?,It doesn't seem like her voice is warm in the recording.The songs are a bit boring as far as jazz themed music goes.She seems like she's sleepy while singing it or doing her impression of a soulful lounge singer.When I look at the cover I ask why is she trying to use sex to sell it with that frizzy ball of hair hanging and her dress hiked up her thighs? It's a sad attempt and you people who purchase it and Amazon who keeps putting her CDs on my front page perpetrate the idea that there's actual music in the CD.This is not very good in my opinion. It's cardboard and boring.
3,ho hum,"I enjoy so many different voices and versions that bring variety to Xmas songs, and have a number of CDs (and even tapes!); but I will not be adding this one to my collection, for all that I enjoy jazz singing. So, it's Diana Krall. I am just not enthralled or impressed by her singing. To me, this is just another of this year's overly-hyped Xmas CDs."
2,"Painful to listen to - why did you do it, Diana?","I love Diana Krall. The DVD of her concert in Paris is fabulous,and you Krall fans know what I am talking about. I have a 2-disc set of her best tunes and the CDs are a joy to listen to. She is superb--when she is singing JAZZ!I had high hopes for this new CD. I thought, with the right arrangements, she could pull it off. Unfortunately, she didn't. Knowing how good she really is, this was painfull to listen to. The only thing more painful to listen to was Stevie Nicks singing ""Silent Night.""Some Christmas albums are great, like Bing Crosby's 1950s classic, but that is going back a bit. On this disc, Diana just seems out of her element. She could have changed the arrangements, the pacing of the songs, to be more in line with her singing style.I am afraid I won't be listening to this one again. Be warned, Krall fans--you may like it, as some reviewers have stated, or you may find it very disappointing."
2,Good try,"Sorry, Diana. As much as I like your piano ... and voice ... this one doesn't make it. I assume it was the Producer, rather than you, who told you to clip the ends of words. That works in upbeat stuff, but not sentimental - and Christmas time!Still I love your piano and wish there were more!"
2,Not what I expected,"I really like her, but this was very disappointing. I thought . . . Diana Krall, Christmas songs, it's gonna be great, right? Not. I really don't like her style on this at all. I have it in my holiday rotation, and actually turn it down as I find it a little annoying. Just sing already! She has a great voice, but this cd is very choppy sounding. You'd never give her a second chance if this was the first exposure you had to her music."
4,christmas,Amazon was a great site that I was able to find a Christmas Gift for a co-worker-the process was easy and secure.
5,Christmas Songa - Diana Krall,This is a great holiday CD. Diana is great. I bought one for my sisters as a gift to enjoy too. Buy it now!
3,At Least She Made The Effort,"I am also a big Diana Krall fan, but was disappointed with her Christmas CD. The arrangements are okay as is the band, but I just feel like Diana's voice is a bit flat on this one...it just sounds like she is a bit lazy and hasn't really put her heart into it. A little too much emphasis on trying to be jazzy than ""Christmassy"". This CD will not put me in the mood. You might say that I'm a bit more ""traditional"" when it comes to Christmas CD's however at the very least, I need a clear, clean, and beautiful voice to go along with the most beutiful music of the year. Diana just seems like she's hiding her voice, prefering a scat lick to a ""pure"" note. I think this one will go into the drawer....maybe I'll break it out and try again, but I doubt it will work for me. Just doesn't sound like Christmas music. (And what's with that pose on the cover?!!)By the way, Russ Freeman's ""Holiday"" is excellent!!!P Mac"
3,Kind of Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to getting this cd as I was so disappointed with Diana Krall's last album, Girl in the Other Room. I was hoping that this would be more in the jazz vain. It is definately an improvement, however, I felt that the slower songs were very draggy and sometimes it seems like she is trying TOO HARD to swing. The orchestra is fantastic and of course her piano playing, what little there is, is fantastic. I DO like her phrasing on some songs and dont like it on others. All in all it's okay, but im glad I didnt pay full price!! I think there is too much hype and not enough to back it up."
1,Gentil et cucul !,"Gentil et cucul, pépère et nunuche... Cette production de Nol incontournable pour tout artiste US qui se respecte et qui arrondit les comptes de sa maison de production avec un format devenu, outre atlantique une vraie institution cultuelle ou culturelle. C'est affligeant de plans convenus et de mise en boite orchestrale ; bon c'est toujours mieux que le Papa Nol de ce bon vieux Tino.. encore que... Ne s'écoute que 8 jours par an et une fois tous les 10 ans."
2,don't know what this means,"It's ok. I was a little disappointed; all of the tracks seem to sound the same. I like Diana Krall alot, though, I will continue to purchase her music."
1,It's not a total failure but...,"I totally agree with the review that said Diana Krall does not sync up with the band. There is something so totally off about her singing and it does not mesh with the traditional big band style that Christmas songs shine with.I love Diana Krall. I have since I was in college almost 10 years ago. But listening to her singing on this album was just too much to bear. Off key, strange phrasing, and a disregard for becoming one with the orchestra. I am very disappointed."
5,YeeHaa. Merry Christmas.,"Hot babe. Good Jazz.Helluva voice.Nice take on some well-worn standards.This and the Vince Guarldi Charlie Brown Christmas album are the only two Christmas albums that should be given to everybody who ever bought a CD player, Ipod, whatever.Nice dress.Elvis Costello (Mr. Diana Krall) better thank God every day.I proudly listen to this album at non-Christmas times of the year, by the way. When it plays at work, someone almost always stops and says ""Who is THAT?""; never ""Why are you listening to Christmas music in June?"". That's the power of the voice and arrangements we're dealing with, here.Thank you for coming into my life, if only as a beautiful voice. And what a voice!"
2,It's ok,"Having heard of Diana Krall from friends that are fans, but never having listened to her music, I thought this would be a nice addition to our family's christmas collection. After 3 or 4 listens I can say it's just ok. There aren't any standout tracks here and it just isn't very much fun. I might add a song or two to a christmas mix but don't think I would put this disc in just to listen to on its own. If I had been a fan of Ms. Krall I suppose I would have known what to expect, but there isn't anything here that would entice me to spend any more time or money on her music."
2,BORING...,"Just plain boring, and I LIKE Diana Krall. She has chosen a bunch of overplayed Christmas songs that I thought would at least be interesting to listen to her interpretation of, but that's not the case. Don't waste your time on this."
3,Snow job!,"I am one of those who have everything Ms. Krall has laid out for us. But this just seems to be lost in the holiday crowd. It is too bad she sounds so ""stuck on herself"" with style and arrangements. ""Holiday Songs"" should have been the title, since Wally World, Sears, Circuit City and Target are saying Nyet to the ""C"" word this year. It was so lackluster...I am wrapping up for my son as a gift...just need an explanation for the missing Shrink wrap! I am disappointed...and most of us fans who are waiting for the next ""fresh"" DK cd, will be too!"
1,Worst of Diana Krall,"Of the four CD I purchased of Diana Krall's music, this is the worst (or at least I hope it is the worst)."
3,"Pretty good, but not vintage Krall","As a former jazz pianist I really appreciate the musicianship and voice quality of a true jazz musician -- Diana Krall. I met her in Escondido in 2001 and was not disappointed -- she's not only a great jazz artist, but a very nice lady. But, in recent years she's gone ""commercial"" as we used to say. This album jumps around too much -- from full ""dance band"" orchestration to quiet ballads. It's not Diana Krall, the jazz artist -- it's a well-crafted commercial offering for the general public. It's OK, but it's not the Diana Krall that I prefer."
3,"Turn the lights down, snuggle up look at the Christmas tree",This is grown up Christmas music. I think it's okay. My husband thinks its great. I don't think I could listen to it over and over again in a day. But on occassion during the holidays it makes for nice romantic tree gazing music.She has a nice sultry jazzy style.
2,If you like Diana Krall you'll probably hate this review.,"I love Diana Krall's voice, style, the music she chooses to record, and the polish of her music. I have all her CDs and they're great. So, when I got this CD at Christmas 2005 I was really disappointed. Look, it's OK, I guess, but not up to her usual standards. There's no enthusiasm here (except for the false enthusiasm of her fingernail-on-chalkboard tittering ""I'm just crazy 'bout hooorses"").Rather than write it off as just average I decided to give it a whirl again for Christmas '06, and had the same reaction. Guys might like this CD for her recumbent ""come hither and unwrap THIS present"" look and posture on the CD packaging, but there's little to come hither for inside."
2,Who told Ms. Krall she must record a Christmas album?!,"I loved the editorial review of this album when it began saying, 'as the song goes, ""Merry Christmas"" has already ""been said many times, many ways' but I disagreed when Ms. Leah Weathersby said ""Diana Krall's Christmas Songs is a worthy -though not particularly unique -addition to the holiday catalog.'In fact there is nothing worthy here beyond the beautiful photos of a beautiful woman set by a marketing department which seems to be selling cosmetics or alike. Maybe they think music is just a plus. A not worthy plus containing the same old Xmas repertoire with a neglectable approach.Sounds like a false variation when Ms. Krall engages in pretending she is creating something that's nothing on her funny approach with no fun modifications in 'Jingle Bells' wrapped in a band swinging that does not convince.Who told Ms. Krall she must record a Christmas album?!"
1,Koolatron WC96G,"This was a gift that caused mucho aggrevation.There was so much condensation inside that we had to tip the cooler and pour the water out in a bucket twice a week. Nevertheless, the LED light went dead and the innards rusted out within six-months. It took forever and $18.00 for shipping to get Koolatron to replace it, and now I wonder whether it will rust out and stop working again in six months. If it does, out to the trash it goes. I can't go through the hassle of getting another replacement..."
1,Question about repair service,Lentek Wco6G-ca6 Less than a year old & will not cool. Unable to find where to have repaired. I think the AC adapter is bad. I need a model PAA060F replacement. Can anyone HELP?????????? Where could I get one?
5,Simply awesome,"This monitor is simply excellent. We bought two for our small company, and plan to buy more. It enhances everything you do, and is great for graphic design, schematic capture, board layout, etc.Our two monitors do not have the power button issue that the other user mentioned. Perhaps he is confused by the fact that it's a capacitance push-button. You don't press it, you simply place your finger over it.Be sure that your graphics card can support this monitor at native resolution. The card needs to have enough umph, and a DVI-D dual link connector."
3,Could have been a lot better,"There is a lot of potential for a great book here, but this one does not live up to it. There is a lot more about the wings of the CIA than found in this book.Sam McGowan, Vietnam Veteran and author of ""The Cave,"" a novel of the Vietnam War."
4,A purposely vague and thus misunderstood book,"George Bataille's ""Theory of Religion"" is an attempt to sum up religion in as succinct a manner as possible. To be all things to all religions, the book is very vague and difficult to understand. Bataille created a chart or table to explain what he was doing and to give body to the work. ALAS! The chart is not in the book, lost to time. Thus, as it exists, Bataille's book is a glimpse into the inner workings of a genius mind. It is a colorful attempt to understand ""religion,"" whatever that is. Further, it is an off-the beaten path romp through the daisies of the study of religion, sweet flowers that often remain unromped."
3,"Very abstract at beginning, firms up as it goes along.","Interesting associations made by the author. The initial chapters are somewhat opaque, but careful reading will allow for understanding. Overall, pretty good, although a bit pretentious. To paraphrase the concept, 'if your deriving utility, you've lost the essence or true reality... that is, if you moved from object to subject, well you've embraced capitalism, you dog! (well, i think thats what he is trying to say...smile)."
3,Misleading old footage,"On one hand, these DVDs present a host of interesting facts and amazing footage all about African wildlife. However, it is completely misleading that the copyright date on this DVD set is 2007. Most of the parts we've seen so far were produced in the early 80s, making the facts almost 30 years old and thus quite outdated. Watching the gorillas, it is claimed that Dian Fossey is alive and well and teaching in the US, when she was brutally murdered in 1985. As I said, the collection is good, but be aware that much has changed in the last 30 years..."
2,Not the best I've seen,"I'm very disappointed with this collection. The filming and information given is very old and outdated. Just finished watching the second disk (Gorillas and Great Apes) and it was filmed in 1976! I own lots of documentaries, and this is by far the worst I have. It seems focused more on the history of the awful things people do to African animals. For a huge nature/animal lover like myself, I'm finding it hard to even get interested enough to sit through one episode, let alone the entire collection. If you want to learn about wildlife and the planet then I strongly suggest purchasing the Planet Earth or Blue Planet Collections. They are both much more informative and current, not to mention breathtaking to watch. This DVD set just doesn't even come close in quality."
3,my review,"Good Collection, Contains wonderful shotsFilm output is old somewhat, you feel like they didn't use new techniquesPackaging is not good"
5,Kaiser Bakeware Basic Tinplate 9-by-2-Inch Springform Pan with 2 Bases,"I love spring form pans. Yes, you have to be careful with washing them, but they work really well and save so much time since they come apart, for releasing items and the washing!"
4,"A favorite, 8 years and counting...","I can honestly say that I enjoy each track on this CD. Chante has such a sweet voice and it is well suited to this collection of songs about love and romance. The lyrics are beautiful -- ""Look at me, but not with your eyes, touch me with more than your hands."" (From Listen to My Song). This woman is singing about unabashed emotion and love without boundaries. This CD delves into the way you immerse yourself in another person before you become bitter and jaded.My favorites are the title track ""Precious"" (This song makes me want to learn French!), ""Sexy thing"" and ""It's Alright."" I really like ""Candlelight and You"" a sexy romp of a duet with Keith Washington. This CD is a classic."
4,SUPERB!!!!!!,"Miss Chante Moore has come out with great songs over the years but i keep comming back to this album....the way she captivates you is amazing, sweet and sultry there is no other way to describe it."
5,DELIGHTFUL,"This CD is just like the heading states, delightful. I grew up listening to this to woman since I was 12 years old and I KNEW her songs but the lyrics (I paid no attention to I was 12 yrs old) I never knew them true to my heart. I am older and wiser now and this CD is unbelievable. I know now why my mother had his CD on repeat for hours on end. The lyrics, the melodies the material is just incredible. Her voice is splendid and her songs amazing. This is real R&B without a rapper on the hook or hooked into some sample of an old rap beat. This is the stuff R&B artists should be made of. PURE and unsaturated from thier style an essance. Take it away Chante Moore you really have shown how PRECIOUS you are."
3,Shows Great Potential.,"The most maddening thing about Chante' Moore's 1992 debut is the fact that the above mentioned potential is so rarely showcased. Her voice is a supple, flexible instrument that deserves a real workout and top-notch songwriting and arrangements, which are in very short supply here. The songs are fairly pedestrian, but pleasant for listeners who don't want much of a challenge. The ""Quiet Storm Mix"" of ""Love's Taken Over"" (with it's interpolation of Marvin Gaye's classic ""Flyin' High In The Freindly Sky"") is saved for last because it's the best thing here; a sublte, lilting guitar lick, exotic percussive textures, a string section that fairly washes over the listener and a flawless vocal by Moore. While not worth the price of an entire CD full of filler, it is a wondrous listen. This gets 3 stars for her voice and that 1 track and I'm being generous. Her second LP would be a vast improvement."
4,Nice Electric Shaver,"The shaver is very nice and works well. Hadn't used an electric razor in 30 years or so but after getting used to this one, it seems to give a close shave. The cost was up there but seems to be worth it so far. I've had it for about a month or so. I have been off work for awhile and have only been shaving 2X per week and it doesn't seem to mind the heavy growth and it doesn't pull the whiskers either. The cleaning mode is nice but it is a little loud when going through the cleaning cycle."
4,Individual opinions will always vary,I purchased this shaver 1 year ago for myself and found it to be the best electric shaver I had ever used. I still use a multibladed razor also and feel that using both the bladed and electric works for me. The electric seems to shave me better around the mouth and chin area and the bladed seems to shave the neck better.A year later I purchased another Braun 9595 for a Christmas present to my son-in-law. He did not like it and I returned it.I gave it a 4 because of the individual opinion issue. The quality of the product really is 5 star though. If you are inclined to like the electric shaver this one is the best!
4,Excellent,"In setting the rating (number of stars), I had a bit of a quandary: IF I were rating it against all the other electric razors I have ever had, I would give it all 5 stars. However, I am rating it against what I would like to see as an ideal razor, which I guess does not exist. The ideal razor would shave as close as a blade WITHOUT requiring multiple passes over one's skin. This one falls far short of that. However, I have had Remington and Norelco in the past, and this one beats them significantly, both in ability to handle a tough beard and in comfort.I have had this razor for only about 2 weeks now, so can't say anything about longevity. IF you have a wimpy beard, you may be happy with a much less expensive razor. If you have a tough beard and have been frustrated by other razors (and if you are not expecting perfection), I do highly recommend this razor."
4,Braun Pulsonic 9595 -- Pre-shave Issue,"I bought this shaver February 2008. I like the close shave, & the cleaning system. However, the shaver recently began to strain, & sometimes had difficulty starting, even though the battery was fully charged. I called Braun customer service, & was informed that repairs would be on me (& not under warranty) if damage resulted from my use of pre-shave (and I do in fact use pre-shave). This was quite a surprise, as there's nothing in the shaver's literature that warns against the use of pre-shave (I use Williams Ultra). Has anyone else had this experience with Braun?"
3,Work Great for about 2 years,This razor gives me a great shave and boy does it clean well the only minus is cost and needs new cleaner every month or so.Update: razor only lasted 2 years before the razor would not start and the trimmer broke. Called Braun and Braun said they are supposed to last two years.for 200 I Hope not.
5,Closest Shave Ever,"This is the 3rd Braun Shaver that I've owned. With each purchase, I've upgraded and noticed a better, closer shave. Well, this IS the ultimate shaving experience with an electric shaver. Even though it appears a bit pricey, after one use you'll see why. I'd highly recommend this shaver to anyone."
4,High price & high quality shaver,"This is the 4th electric shaver I have purchased and the 2nd Braun. Overall I am very pleased with the performance of this shaver.Pros:* Well balanced feel and size.* Rubberized grip keeps shaver from slipping in to the sink!* Easy to ready LCD display lets you know when to charge and clean.* Less irriatating on skin, could just be me?* Extremely close shave, better than any other shaver I have owned.* Can be cleaned by rinsing in water or using the cleaning solution.Cons:* Very expensive"
5,electric shaver technology,"This Braun shaver series seven, matches the claims made for its effectiveness. Having tried electric shavers in the past, this is the only one that cuts my beard with hairs growing in at a variety of angles in a smooth consistent way. Always before, I had to revert to my wet shave razor blade technology, but not this time. I needed an electric shaver due to broken bones in my right shoulder preventing me from using my right hand, and I am right handed. I could use this shaver with my left hand while my bones were healing, and much to my surprise I got a very close shave, with a minimum of razor burn. I plan to make this my permanent shaver and can eliminate the wet shave altogether except in an electrical blackout/emergency lasting several days."
5,Very satisfied!,"After having used Braun shavers since their first model, and a couple of others, I find this Series 7 to be by far the best. After using it for three weeks, it gives a very smooth shave, without ever hurting my skin even if I go back again and again to clean up any left over hard spots. It is not exactly cheap but pleasant to use and I can wholeheartedly recommend it."
5,Great Value,"While the unit does run hot after a few minutes of use, I found that to be its' only flaw. It took about 3 weeks for my skin to get used to changing from a normal razor blade to this electric but now it shaves great. It isn't as close and I have to shave every day, but overall its a great time saver; I often shave during the drive in to work."
3,Not substitute for a blade,"This shaver will not substitute for a blade shave, but does better than some previous razors on this 69 year old face. One feature missing is a trimmer. Not much difference between this screen type of shaver and a rotary shaver for closeness. The innovative recharging base offers a change with the automatic cleaning the razor by flushing a solution through the heads after each use, which will require occasional purchasing of CCR refills for the cleaner. It also may be cleaned in the normal methods as well. Overall, it does allow for a faster shave without the lathering mess of a blade, but don't expect a real close shave."
4,Braun pulsonic system 9595 w-LCD screen,"I bought the latest model of Braun 9595 razor for my boyfriend's Christmas's present. He wanted a new electric razor so I did some investigations. If you haven't visited Braun's website to see their video advertisment on the 9595, check it out. It's worth the time investment. As for the razor, there is a significant difference is smoothness. I'm really happy I purchased the Braun 9595, I love the feel of his face against my skin. The only downfall of the product is the design of liquid reservoir in the base unit. If you pack the base or tilt it, the liquid will spill. The work around is, just take the razor and not the base unit if you're leaving out of town for a few days. Other than that small design flaw, I highly recommend this razor over the other designs available today."
2,Pulls whiskers,"I previously owned a Braun 8595, which was the best shaver I'd ever owned. I replaced it because the battery seemed to be dying. After using the Series 7 790cc Model 5671 for 2 months, it stills pulls a whisker or two every time I use it. I'm replacing it with a Series 5, in the hope that the ""Pulsonic"" or ""Flexing head"" feature is the problem, and that the Series 5 performs as well as the 8595. Whisker-pulling was the reason, decades ago, that I was never able to use a Norelco."
1,Lasted 10 weeks then failed,"For the first ten weeks this was a good shaver. It was very quiet - much quieter than earlier Braun shavers that I have used.In the tenth week, mid-shave, it became VERY loud. So loud that it hurt my ears when trying to shave near to them.Amazon will not let you return this item, because the cleaning fluid is alcohol-based. so I second another reviewers comments ""Don't buy this from Amazon"".I shall not buy another Braun shaver. Their quality has gotten steadily worse in the last 10 years."
3,Over-rated,"I bought it because of the great reviews from others here on Amazon. I wanted The Best -- and a fast shave -- but disappointed:- Shaving is slow- It's loud- The cleaning cycle is loud- Why do I need auto-cleaning? Sounded nice, but pointless. You spend more time managing the auto-cleaning parts- It's unnecessarily complex -- too many buttons, options, etc.- The charging/cleaning unit is bulkyGoing back to my simple, reliable Norelco... takes just as long to shave, none of all the complex junk"
2,Unimpressed,"I almost never review products on Amazon, however, given that I relied on the reviews to buy this product I felt the need to comment in this instance. I have been using a Braun electric razor for many years, probably 3 or four models over time, and was in the market to replace my 8985 which was getting on in years. I figured rather than replace the blades for the third time on the 8985 I might as well upgrade to the ""latest and greatest"". Big mistake. I have been shaving with the 7-790cc for about a month or so now and within 8 hours of shaving it feels as if I never shaved. I waited over a month to write this review to give my face / skin a chance to adjust to the new razor as suggested, however, I am going to go back to my old 8985 since the shave was much closer. I would have expected a major improvement when spending over $200, however, unfortunately this shaver was a step backwards."
1,Warning - Amazon will not exchange this product when faulty,"The unit I received was faulty (would not clean), however Amazon would not accept returns of the product (even for exchange). Presumably because of the container of cleaning fluid that is shipped with it. Since it is a complex piece of machinery, I cannot recommend buying it with Amazon."
2,Return of the Braun,"I bought this as a gift for my husband for Christmas. He has been shaving with a razor forever and decided to try an electric razor. This seemed the best product with the best reviews out there. He tried it twice and both times it would give a close shave in some patches but most spots(the neck) there was still stubble. He was disappointed that it was not as close a shave as using a razor. He wanted to return the product and just continue using his regular razor. We contacted Amazon and they said we couldn't return it because it had been used at least once, well, this was a 200$ product so we then had to go and sell it on Ebay to get back some of our money.Needless to say this was an expensive try at shaving with an electric shaver."
2,Braun Pulsonic 9595,"Shaver works ok, had an older Braun shaver that actualy did a better job of cutting."
3,Impossible neck,"This razor was much better and gave a closer shave than previous razors I have had. However, there is one spot on either side of my neck that is apparently impossible for the razor to reach, dispite trying every angle. Even after several days of growth it cannot cut the hair. So I still need to use a blade twice a week to get a descent shave."
2,"Do NOT buy, you have been warned","***WARNING, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT***I have had this for 2+ years, and as with what others said the shaver will lose contact with the base due to the contacts on the base being cheap. The metal wears away in just a short few months of use from the vibration of cleaning. Braun needs to redesign those contacts better. I had to pull mine apart and solder the front contacts so that it would charge/clean again. That is POOR design for such an expensive setup.Also, after your face has adjusted to the shaver, it makes the blade/shaver not cut as close as it used to, even with a brand new replacement blade, it just doesnt cut like it used to. I have to go back with a flat blade/disposable razer to get the rest or else it will leave stubble. That could just be me, however others are reporting the same thing."
4,Nice Razor,"I've always been a Norelco guy. I made the switch to this razor because it seemed Norelco's quality control has dropped off. I absolutely love this razor. It's a bit pricey, but the cleaning systems works very well, is fairly quiet, and turns itself off after the cleaning is done."
1,BEWARE Braun Warranty Issues!!!,"I purchased this Braun Shaver directly from Amazon more than a year ago. It came with a 2-Year Warranty. A few months after I began using it I noticed that the cleaning base and the shaver were defective. I tried contacting Braun customer service on April or May 2009 so that I could send my shaver for repair or replacement. However, it was extremely hard to get a hold of them. They finally answered one of my emails yesterday, which was September 22nd, 2010.I DON'T RECOMMEND anyone to purchase Braun products. I'm surprised Amazon is selling Braun products since Braun has such horrible service."
1,Buy It Somewhere Else,"2 days after I ordered this from Amazon, they dropped the price five dollars. I called them up for a price differential credit, which was refused by 2 customer service reps and their supervisors. They said that on September 1, 2008, Amazon had eliminated their 30 day price differential credit policy. When I asked where I could find this change detailed on their site (they have had this policy since Amazon opened), they said it wasn't there.I wrote to Jeff Bezos. His assistant replied to me, and politely refused the $5 refund. I asked where the updated policy could be found, and was told that since there was no longer such a policy, no mention of it can be found on their website.I suggest you buy this product from a merchant who is both more upfront about their policies, and more concerned with customer satisfaction, which sadly at one time would have been Amazon."
1,Does not shave all your hairs on your neck,Costs about 200 bucks I'd say they spent half of that on the packaging. It shaves most of your hairs fine its just some on the neck dont get cut. Also can't be used in the shower which is a great place to shave hairs. I've only used it once and I don't like it. My old panasonic is much much better.
1,dont expect 50 promo code,dont expect 50 promo code unless you fight for it. they will keep putting you off. many bad reviews at amazon what happened to amazon?
2,Will not buy based on the reviews,"I had this in my cart here at good old Amazon and than I read M. J. McConnell's review. His review is listed under the 4 star reviews and he states that this is old stock that Braun/Proctor and Gamble is trying to get rid of. Well I believe him. When it comes to capitalism and the lies they spread I rather keep looking for an honest company that sells a good electric razor. So Braun/Proctor and Gamble I was ready to dish up close to $300.00+ (Braun Series 7- 790cc shaver, Braun Clean & Renew Refills, Braun Replacement Pulsonic 9000 Series Foil - extra stuff in case of a nuclear holocaust) but decided not to when I read the other reviews. I have an old Braun 5110 that shaves just fine. That is the reason for 2 stars. Companies today just don't make stuff like they use too. Have you checked out the size of Chips Ahoy cookies - I mean they are getting to be the size of a quarter."
3,Braun Series 7-790cc,"This shaver is very disappointing in its performance. One has to go over and over to get a decent shaving. Its performance is quite poor in the neck area as the surface is not leveled. Above all, it is excessively overpriced and hence I won't recommend this to anyone at the current market price, $ 239.00."
4,"Not as close as I would like, but still great","I have been using this shaver for two months, and it does a reasonable job. I still have difficulty getting a close shave in certain trouble spots, but it does a better job in general than any other electric shaver I have used."
1,Terrible Shave,"I expected an outstanding shave with this ""top of the line"" razor. As it turns out, my 7 year old Remington MS3-4700, which has 4 year old cutting blades, shaves closer than this Braun did out of the box. I will give it points for giving an extremely comfortable shave, but that becomes meaningless when you have a shadow 2 hours after shaving. With all the outstanding reviews this model has gotten, perhaps my beard just doesn't go well with this razor - who knows. My Braun foil shaver I had before my Remington (about 10 years ago) gave a much closer shave, for sure."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this shaver 6 months ago based on the great reviews in Amazon. My experience has not been that great. The shaver has trouble picking up longer hair, and I find myself going over rough spots in the evening. When I left the shaver at a friends and had to use my ""worn out"" Norelco I was stuck by how much closer and more comfortable the shave was. The Braun is also pretty noisy."
2,Not bad ... as long as it works ...,"I used this for about two years. It was fine for a while, and then the charger went on the fritz. While I was waiting for a replacement, I went back to using old-school blades and cream and haven't looked back. I hadn't used a non-electric razor since 1997, but things have really changed. The Gillette Fushion Proglide is excellent, permitting a much closer shave (than this Braun or any electric razor) and not nicking your skin as the old razors did."
5,"Close as a Razor, But Faster","My results with the Pulsonic are not baby's butt smooth across my bread. However, I've tried everything available except a straight razor, and nothing gets there. There are always areas where rubbing against the grain will detect minute stubble. Even with an aggressive razor (Merkur Slant Bar with Feather blades) and aggressive techniques (blade buffing and j-hooking), that stubble can not be removed without cuts or razor burn. The Pulsonic is a significant improvement over previous Braun shavers. I can get the same results in 2 minutes with the Pulsonic compared to 15 minutes with a wet shave. That wins my vote."
3,Too Pricey,"Shave decently, but I expect more from a shaver at this price. Just not worth the money it costs."
2,After using for a year or more,"I always thought that the Braun shaver would be a great product, so when my Norelco shaver died I purchased this model. At first the shaver wasn't that great, but the directions said if coming from a rotary shaver you wouldn't get great results at first. After using for three months I still didn't see much improvement. I put it aside and used a Gillette razor and shaving cream. I started using the Braun razor again just recently and I am still disappointed in the results. Shaving cream and a razor for me."
4,Like it,I like the design and the look of the shaver.Just the cleaning solution is a bit expensive given that it dry out in about 2 months.
3,Good razor,"Decent razor, but why too pricey for what you get. Everything about it is pricey. I prefer my more simple previous razor that didn't require cleaning pods. I was hoping this razor would do what it said and shave closer than any other, but sadly my previous $60 razor gave as good, if not better, of a shave."
2,Expensive and poorly made,"I bought this product to replace a Philips shaver that I had used for 15 years before it died. I bought the Braun to give the foil heads a try (as opposed to rotary heads of the Philips). The shaver worked well for about 2 years. The part which I am most disappointed about is the cleaning system called 'Clean and Renew'. The unit is cheaply made and cleaning solution seems to evaporate rapidly as the seals are not that great. This means you have to replace the cleaning solution capsule too often. In addition, the power cord does not sit firmly in the socket on the cleaning unit and thus does not make good contact. Shaver itself works reasonably well although hair stubbles seem to leak from shaver chamber occasionally even after cleaning. For the price, the unit is a disappointment."
5,Super shaver,"Sturdy feeling shaver. Great shaving result without any rash or irritation. The shaver is quiet big, which makes the handling comfortable, but it's a little big to travel with I guess. The basestation looks a bit cheap in comparison with the premium looks of the shaver."
1,Disappointed- Returned to Braun,"I've been shaving with the Braun Syncro 7680, and can honestly tell you that it's provided the best shave ever. I decided to give myself an upgrade this past Christmas to the new 7 series Pulsonic expecting that the new shaver would provide an even better shave- especially for the hefty price tag. The new system seems to shave a bit quicker, but would irritate a lot more and shave no where near as close. I could go two days with the old shaver before ""needing"" to shave again. With the new Pulsonic, I would need to shave everyday- bummer. After hoping for the best and allowing my face to adjust for 4 weeks, nothing changed. What a disappointment- I've since returned the shaver under the 60 day money back guarantee. I'm sticking with my old Braun- the grass isn't always greener..."
3,Decent but not Great,"I have used electric razors for virtually all my adult life. I change razors every one to two years. I tend to buy the top of the line simply hoping that it saves me precious time in R&D; about the products.The previous one I owned was a Panasonic (their top of the line). When Braun came out, the one feature that I really liked was that you can shave with the cord even when the battery is drained. With Panasonic, you have to wait for the battery to charge.However, despite the nice looks and OK shave, I think the Panasonic was better.Braun's Pulsonic doesn't seem as close."
1,Braun Pulsonic,I got this shaver for a Christmas gift from my fiance. I read all the reviews online and on Men's Health and decided to get this instead of the Phillips.Let me start by saying that I have VERY sensitive skin.This razor did nothing like all the ads states. It was a rough shave. Had to go over my face numerous times and even dig the razor into the the neck to get at some whiskers.It left my face red and bumpy and my skins burned for hours after the shave.I ultimately returned it to Braun being very disappointed and now am searching for a new razor and looking at the new Phillips.I would NOT recommend this shaver to anyone-especially if you have a soft sensitive face and skin.Sorry Braun....Sorry Amazon but I am just being very honest to try and help the other consumers who may look at this.Hope this helps......
4,Hubby likes it but....,"he isn't in love with it (yet anyway). He has been using it for about a month. It seems to take a little less time to shave but he doesn't think the money was worth it compared to this previous model, also a Braun. Maybe that's why; he has been using Braun all along.The cleaning is great, it does make a difference in how the shaver performs."
2,Not worth the money,"I read the reviews, I've had 4 or 5 electric razors over the years, and I was ready to pay for the best razor out there. This isn't it. I have an ultrasonic toothbrush and I really liked it. That's why I tried this out.It still takes several passes to catch hairs, no different than my cheap electric razor and maybe not any better at all.The clipper on the side is at a 90 degree angle, meaning it's hard to trim eyebrows or beards with it, or get under hairs that the razor misses.The LCD is nice for showing the battery level, but the hygiene one is B.S. It just goes by the run time. I'm sure they make money on the refills and that's why it goes down so fast. I just rinse it with water and do the auto clean in the base once a week or so.I really wanted to like this thing, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,too much!,"I bought this razor after my wife said I needed a new one. It cost $200! It doesn't work any better than my 5-6 year old norelco, not to say that means it's bad, just not any better. I've needed to do little with the norelco except rinse it out under the tap. Never replaced original blade wheels even. The pulsonic wants to give me it ""hygiene"" and wants me to clean it when IT decides that's needed. It goes through a little song and dance as it does so, with flashing lights and various sounds. You'll also have to buy the hygiene solution about monthly, and it costs a lot more than tap water. I cannot understand why any sane designer thinks this kind of crap (excuse my anglo-saxon) and also spoiling the relative purity of a quiet early morning with 'hygiene' paranoia will appeal to anyone with much cortex left. There, I'm feeling better."
1,Bad shave and broken after a few months,I bought this shaver because of the Braun name. It's rubbish! Not a close shave when it worked. And now the cleaning housing does not work. Don't waste your money. I will stick with Panasonic for a better shave and longer life.
1,Disappointing quality/customer service,"Base stops working right after 2 months of use. Braun won't just send replacement, advise you to mail it in for repairs (with original receipt) or take it to 'licensed service center (also with original receipt). Complete pain. For a $200+ shaver they should just send replacement. Or it shouldn't break in the first place."
3,Noy worth the money,"I've always used rotary shavers, which did the job. This razor does the job but takes longer and is louder. Paying for the auto clean is a waste of money it takes a few minutes to do it yourself."
2,Ok product....not that great,Too expensive for what you get as a product. This shaver doesn't shave that well. For one thing it is too loud and doesn't shave neck hair. I bought a norelco shaver and I like that one better but I guess its a personal choice.
1,WARNING-NON RETURNABLE ITEM!!!!!!!!,Do not order this item as a gift!!!!! Even if it is unopened you cannot return it!!All over the Amazon web site it tells you how easy it is to return items butthey will not return this shaver.
5,Review on Braun Electric Shaver Series 7-990cc,"I could not be more pleased with my new Braun shaver. Previously, I had an Norelco, which I thought was good, but it doesn't compare to this new Braun.The cleaning feature is teriffic. I only wish I had purchased it sooner. --- Bob Jones, Sachse, Texas"
3,Not worth the price & hype,"I ordered this Braun Pulsonic electric razor and had delivered to an address in the US, since I was outside the country. Upon visiting I used this razor for 6 weeks before returning home. I concluded that it is way overpriced. It took just as long to shave with it than any other Braun or Norelco. The only difference I found is that it is a bit heavier, a stronger motor, and has metal parts instead of 100% plastic, thus making it appear to be worth more. I still found it insufficient in cutting hairs on the neck and around the adam's apple. Instead of paying $200 USD I could just as well paid$50+ less for something equivalent. I fell for some very slick marketing for sure."
3,great but broke in less than a month of use,great shaver; great shave ... but the shaver stopped communicating with the base unit in less than 30 days of use and also would not recharge.
1,I liked this shaver a lot - for the first 11 months...,"It worked fine for 11 months. Went to shave and it was dead even though it had been charging for most of the day. I researched and found other people had same problem. I am dreading the hassle I know awaits me of trying to get this fixed. Sorry Braun, for years I used your products but $200+ for 11 months can by me a lot of disposable razors. Before buying read the reviews (1 star and 2 star) to balance out the higher scores. I rated it highly too, at first."
3,"Close shave, but cannot recommend.","I've had this shaver for about six months and it does a nice job of shaving, however today was the third time it has cut my lip (when shaving the corner of my mouth). It must be a design flaw in the long hair trimmer? That's the only thing I can think of that is cutting my lip. They already replace the head and that obviously didn't help. Therefore I don't recommend this shaver.Also, you should note that the cleaning system in these new shavers are not like the old days where you can just open it, brush or blow it out and keep going. You need to use their solution and station or rinse it in water, but if using water it won't dry out unless you remove the head and set it off to the side (basically it's a pain and those cleaning kits are expensive)."
4,Nice and fancy,"It comes with a fancy nice box, lot's of accessories and a travel box for the shaver. My bf loves it and the nice thing is the automatic cleaning option. You can choose when to clean it and it will shut it off automatically. There is an indicator showing how clean your shaver is and you can decide when to clean it. Apparently according to him the shaving is nice, close and clean shave, but you really have to get used to the pulsonic thing and the rotating shaver. The cons is still the noise that it makes. It's really loud when the shaver is working including during cleaning."
3,loud but good,"While the shave is very good, and I like the cleaning system, Beware that this is a very noisy unit both while shaving and while cleaning."
5,shaver,"My husband thrilled with this X Gift, in two weeks he has perfect shave in least amount of time, still raves about it. This is the one to get for heavy bearded people"
4,Braun Pulsonic,"I was disappointed that my husband wasn't THRILLED with the shaver, given the hype and the price. He says it does a good job shaving, but he says it is so large that he isn't sure if he wants to take in when we travel, which is fairly often. I am happy because it cleans itself, so I feel it is much more hygenic this way. I'll get him to take it on his next trip, and we can see if plugging up the cleaning solution for travel is worth it all."
4,A Nice Improvement,I have owned two earlier version Braun electric shavers and liked them both. This one offers a good shave and less concern for nicking and rawness on the face. I have only had it a few weeks but it is working fine. I always buy my shavers in pairs. I travel so much that I keep one in my suitcase all the time for traveling. This system is more expensive but has worked fine and provides a backup should I need it - which I haven't needed to date.
5,"I buy from Amazon all the time, but this is a review of the shaver that I bought elsewhere.","I had the braun activator, which did ok. This is in a whole new league. I have very sensitive skin and recommend this product to anyone who has issues with shaving. For those who can't use cheap razors, this is a must-buy!"
2,Read this before you buy this shaver!!!!!,"I wish I had read before I did. The shaver is not worth the money you spend if you have a tough beard. I do and I thought with the new ""technology"" promised, I would get a better shave than with my older electric shavers. I did not. Actually, my older Braun series 3 cuts closer and in much less time than this one does. The cleaning feature is very nice but not worth the extra $130 you spend on it from a lower series Braun.The main reason I wrote this review is to warn people that if you buy it and have a poor experience like I did YOU CANNOT RETURN IT THROUGH AMAZON. Because this shaver comes with the cleaning fluid which is flamable, Amazon will not allow you to return it. You can return it to Braun within 60 days but you have to ship it to them in either GERMANY or AUSTRAILIA. The shipping charges are really high.So just be warned before you purchase."
2,Inadequate Cleaning Dock,"This shaver does a great job. It is clean, efficient, overall I give the shaver itself a 5 star.However, once you use the shaver, you have to put it back into a plastic cleaning dock that cleans the shaving heads and recharges the battery.The fit of the shaver into the dock is so inadequate that the blue led on the shaver (the one that shows it is charging) sometimes flashes intermittently. (the dock does fantastic light shows while this happens...) You start the cleaning cycle and the shaver vibrates away from the charging contacts. So the cleaning cycle stops. The only reliable way I can get it to clean is to hold the shaver into the dock for 19 minutes. Doesn't that defeat the purpose of the electric shaver?Shaver is great. Cleaning system sucks."
1,Desgin Defect: Braun Series 7-7900cc Pulsonic Shaver,"Just received the new Braun Series 7-7900cc Pulsonic Shaver via Amazon.The shaver locking mechanism fell apart on the side of the head, just hanging there, keeping me from using the cleaning base. When I contacted Braun Customer Service per the manual at 1-800-272-8611 I was informed me that their money back guarantee has been rescinded for defective products. This is in spite of that offer printed in the owner's manual that I received.Their offer now is that, upon receipt of the defective Braun shaver, they will offer a customer credit in eight to ten weeks for future purchase of Braun products, but they are not in a position any more, due to a new policy change, to refund my money.I am irate that they will not stand behind their guarantee anymore on a product that I just received a day ago."
3,Not Blown Away,"I read lots of great reviews for this razor and ordered it with high expectations. I've been using it for about three weeks now and I have to say that I'm not nearly as impressed as everyone else seems to be. Maybe I got a bad unit or something. It feels nice in the hand and it seems quite powerful and the pop-up trimmer works great. But I'm just not getting a very close shave at all with it. I have to go over all parts of my face and neck two or three times, stretching the skin in every way possible, and even then I still find areas that could have been closer.I really wanted to like this razor, especially because it's so expensive. I've had great Braun razors before, but this isn't one of them. I'm sorry that I can't agree with everyone else on this one.BTW, I'm sure that part of the reason this razor is so expensive is because Braun really overdid the packaging. You'd think the packaging was for some precious family heirloom or valuable jewels, not an electric razor."
2,Going Back to Panasonic,"I bought this after reading so many good reviews - and at $300 it MUST be good, right? Well not if you have a relatively soft beard and face. It just leave behind way to many hairs - and never gets close to the skin - so my face still feels like stubble, right after I finish shaving. I even bought a New head ($45) but still, just not good. I tried for 6 months - plenty of time for face to adjust. Still not a good shave. Really a disappointment. My old Panasonic razor (5 years old now) is WAY better - at least for me and my face. And it was only 1/3 of the cost."
4,Price,"This product is great, the problem is your vendor charged $100 more than what I paid thru Amazon earlier this year. Check my acct to verify. SAMs advertised as improved version and visual was a white cleaner/charger base not the black I was shipped. SAMs offered no assistance and customer service was ........"
1,NOT RETURNABLE!!!,"I ordered this as a gift for a friend. He thought it is too complicated to use, also that it takes up too much ""real estate"" in the bathroom and asked me to return it. It is NOT RETURNABLE to Amazon because of the liquid cleaning agent included. I am struggling to find out from Braun how to return it. If you are not absolutely sure about this product do not order it. It may be a great product to some, but if you think you might need to return it DON'T ORDER IT."
1,"Close shave, what a joke",Bought this shaver for myself for christmas because of all of the rave reviews about what a close shave it gets. I am not impressed at all. This shaver takes longer to shave with than a norelco and I have to use a regular razor to go back over area that this thing didn't get. Very displeased!!! Would not recommend
5,A military must!!,"I'm in the Coast Guard and I shave every day. This shaver makes it easy and keeps my skin looking great. As close as any razor. It's a must have, you really get what you pay for. In the long run it saves you money, you don't have to replace blades every few days."
3,As good as I could find,"The Pulsonic is clearly a robust shaver. I've tried many (all?) other makes and types. For me, blade shaving results in nicks and cuts,and too painful to go against the grain. As a retired older person lectric shaving works for me. I simply never can't get the movie-star smoothness..maybe it's the makeup.. from electic or blade. I keep looking, but in vain, for a real breakthrough in shaver design. BTW: the cleaner-charger container is rediculous, a waste of money, esp. for refills. What's wrong with a faucet rinse?"
5,Works Great For Me..,This is the second Braun shaver I've had and so far the best. Simple to use and gives a great shave even in those hard to get at places...
4,Braun Series 7,Product arrived on time and was in perfect condition. Performance of product is very good.
5,Great shaver,"I've had my shaver over a month, and I totally love it. I highly reccomend it to anyone. It shaves great, and NO MANUAL CLEANING!! Just stick it in the base and let it do the cleaning, could not be easier."
3,Review for Braun Series 7 Pulsonic Shaver,I recently purchased a Braun Series 7 Pulsonic shaver and did not give me a close enough shave to be satisfactory.
1,Not as expected *NO RETURN WARNING*,After 8yrs with my Norelco i decided to try an upgrade. This razor was not as advertised for me. Foil does not get as close a shave as lift & cut for me. The product might be the answer for most but again not for me. My problem is now with Amazon. They WILL NOT take returns on this item. I have searched high and low on this page for that disclaimer. Nothing was indicated when finalizing the sale either. Buyer beware.
2,Not as expected,"I bought this shaver to replace an older Braun, not pulsonic. It shaved no closer than the old one and has a shorter battery life. I replaced it with the top Panasonic razor. Much better choice. Disappointed in Braun."
2,I don't get it - are these company reviews???,"This is one of my first Amazon reviews. I love Amazon and spend a ton of money and get packages every day. However, this purchase was a BIG disappointment.I found this thing to either really do a terrible job or my face is different then everyone else's. My shave wasn't nearly as close after 3+ weeks of use and I spent much more time trying (but never succeeding) in getting a close neck shave. I cleaned daily and still ended up with pimples. Best of all, when they mean there are shipping restrictions for this product, it really means you can't send it back to Amazon.IF you are going to try this product, try it from a local retailer that will let you return the product when you don't like it. Maybe my wife can use it on her legs because I went back to my mach4 razor."
2,Going back to blades,"I had never owned an electric razor and decided to give this much lauded device a try. My hope was that I could get a close shave in less time than a razor and with less neck irritation. It took more time, irritated my neck more, and couldn't get all the hairs on my neck no matter how long I spent trying."
1,"Disappointed, even after customer service. . .","I broke from a 15 year habit of using 2 Norelco electrics, and bought the Braun. After giving it 4 months, it just didn't cut as well as my decade old Norelco. I didn't think that was possible, so I contacted customer service. They were fantastic! They sent me a new cutterhead.I put on the new head, and immediately it cut closer. I thought my problems were solved, but after 3 weeks of using the new head, it started pulling my hair HARD. Every morning now it's pulling my hair a dozen times during a shave, and it's VERY painful. Went back to the old cutterhead, and it's not pulling my hair, but I don't get a smooth shave either.Don't know what I could be doing wrong. I'm following every single one of their ""tips"", and I'm cleaning it after EVERY shave.This is a dud."
2,Not Pleased At All,"Was so looking forward to ""upgrading"" my shaver and heard/read so many great things about this one.. First the shave is really not very good at all... Maybe cuz I've shaved with a rotary for 20 years or more, but I was not happy with this shave at all. The trimmer is not very good either and you cannot see where to trim as the shaver head is so big it hides the trimmer.. The shave was rough and the head heated up and I don't like that feeling on my skin.. I had to go over spots multiple times. The cleaning unit is huge too and seems to be just another plot to extract money from us for cleaning supplies... I blew $200 on this??? I'm going back to the rotary.."
2,Braun Series 7 -790cc Pulsonic Shaver,"Purchased june 15 2009. Battery shot already, have to shave with cord attached. E-mailed company, no reply."
5,Excellent! Would Recommend!,"I recently purchased this shaver to replace my Braun 8995. No complaints on the 8995 other than the hairs that would always fall out while shaving.This unit is a definite improvement over that model. It does shave a bit closer than that the 8995. My only issue at this point, it the ""Hygiene"" indicator seems a bit too sensitive and will be at empty after about 2-3 shave. I still get a little bit of droppings out of it but nothing like the 8995."
4,Product is good but Amazon sucks,"I purchased this item at June and it claims I will receive a $50 gift card later. 3 months pasts and I got nothing,"
3,Good Shave But Falling Apart!,"OK, I've used Braun shavers for years and about 1 year ago I bought the Pulsonic. Have enjoyed it-shaves as well as promised.Then within the last month the back under the shaver head started to deterioriate. This part comes in contact with the cleaning solution. Then the trimmer apparatus won't close properly.Braun will not do anything other than allow me to mail it in so they can take a look at it for 4 to 6 weeks.Not real happy. They charge the top price in the market, and have no solution when the product fails except send it in."
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Had been using norelco and the shaver is a bush hog comparing the two shavers and the Norelco was merely a whimp when it came to shaving.Great Buy also
4,Smaller and Redefined,Still a little pricey but well worth the money! It's also a big improvement over it's original design. Very Happy with it!
5,As good as it looks!!!,I've been using a Braun 7526 shaver for about 4 years and decided to upgrade to the top of the line model 9595. First of all the Pulsonic is easier to handle and actually feels lighter than the 7526. As far as the shave is concerned it took less time for me to complete due to less repeat strokes needed in hard to reach areas like neck and adams apple. The hightech look is what turned me on in the first place and you won't be disappointed with it's digital readouts and cool blue light. The cleaning base is also quieter than the older 7526 model with the multi colored readouts as an added bonus. The trimmer function works well also.
3,Braun Shaver,"This shaver works well enough, I guess. I dont think it lived up to some of the reviews I have read. It takes many passes on some parts of my face and only a few on others. With that said, the shave is close and smooth when done. The built-in clipper works great. The cleaning feature works excellent. I have used it for several weeks now and I found myself using my old Norelco sometimes if I am in a hurry. I like the tilting head on the Braun but I like the first pass cutting better on the Norelco. The Braun looks & feels well made."
2,Just another electric shaver,"After reading some of the reviews I got excited and started to think this might be the holy grail of electric shavers. That wonderful piece of machinery that will free me from the shackles of the morning showers necessary to shave with a blade. Alas, I was mislead. The instructions tell me to give my face 2-3 weeks to get used to the electric shaver, but I surmise that this guideline is really meant to close the door to product returns as I am now stuck with this $220 knight in shining armor that slays dragons like a peasant boy. My face is no smoother than it was with any other electric shaver and have a 5pm shadow by 2pm. Do yourself a favor and spend $60 or less for something cheap if you're going to use an electric shaver. I'm going back to morning showers and a blade."
2,Not worth the money,After using many different brands of electric shaver I have concluded that none of them do what they claim - this one included. First of all the price is insane and we were insane to pay it. It does not shave any closer than by old norelco that is still alive and kicking. I have to virtually wear out my skin in order to achieve a smooth shave. The trimmer also stinks. Buy new parts for your old one and save the money.
2,"Good Shaver, Poor Wall Mount Power Supply","I've had the unit about a year. My wall adapter just died this morning for no reason. I like the shaver, but am not looking forward to dealing with costumer service and 2-3 weeks to get a replacement that in the end (from what I've read) I'm going to have to pay for anyways. I might just use a 12v adapter I have for an old CD player. I don't get it, wall mount power transformers are nothing new and are supposed to last pretty long. My god, I can still find junkers from the 60's that still work fine and have been sitting outdoors for years. Braun should be ashamed for selling out to the cheapest bidder on very standard part..."
4,Excellent shave with an ongoing maintenance cost,"My Norelco rotary never did a very good job on my neck without working it hard and causing irritation. I just switched to the Braun and it does a much better job overall with no irritation. I have a heavy beard so it's a good test. The positives- a good, close shave without irritation and gets those pesky neck hairs pretty well. The shaver can be used with the cord and also quick charges if needed. The negatives- Expensive, noisier than the Norelco, you have to buy cleaning cartridges once a month and the charger/cleaner is cheaply constructed. Also be careful with the cleaning cartridges as they spill easily when you pry the cover off. All in all a premium shaving system at a premium price."
4,Not too bad,"I like it, but not as much as my 7526 synchro that I had to replace. It is a little bulky compared to it. I'm not sure if the 10K vibes thing really does anything or not. The travel case is kind of a joke and is only for the shaver not the the shaver and the power cord. Was it worth the over $200 I paid, probably not so it better last me four to five years. I like that it can be rinsed out under the water and the battery and hygiene display that tells you when it needs a full clean. Also that you can do a short clean or a long clean is nice compared to my old syncro."
4,"It is the best, but it's not perfect","As advertised, it is the best electric shave I have ever had. It provides a closer shave and does a better job on my neck. It also doesn't cause irritation. However, it still leaves a few stubborn areas untouched on my neck. This shaver didn't give me the ""perfect"" shave, but it was a nice upgrade from my 3-head rotary Norelco."
5,Pulsonic Blows Norelco Arcitec Away!,"I have both the Braun 9595 Pulsonic electric razors and the Norelco Arcitec 1090X. So I am qualified to compare the two. The Braun is the hands down better shaver and the best shaver I have ever used. The shaver hugs your face and the vibration system is comfortable almost massage like. Shaving with this shaver actually feels good. The Norelco takes TWICE as long to shave my face and with poorer results. The Norelco requires much more do-over work than the Braun and because it is so light it is difficult to control with precision. The Norelco missed hairs even after lengthy shaves. Also, the Braun comes with the nifty base station that cleans the shaver and charges it. Take my word for it the Braun is a hands down winner when you compare these two shavers."
2,"Overpriced, overhyped, and totally outperformed by Panasonic Wet/Dry","I do NOT own this shaver, but before purchasing a Braun dry electric shaver, you may wish to read my review of the newest Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver, the ES8109S, which I posted on November 1, 2007. Panasonics have consistently offered shavers that have quieter, faster motors (13,000 RPMs) than Brauns. The best part of Panasonic shavers is that they allow you to shave with water and shaving foam or gel, which lends to a closer, more irritation free shave. If you have sensitive skin and are looking to make the switch to an electric shaver, or if you just want the best shave an electric can provide, I highly recommend a Panasonic Wet/Dry. You be the judge, but a least be informed."
1,Not A Good Shave,"The good:- This shaver is relatively quiet.- The cleaning/charging system is very nice.The bad:- The price ($186.00). With a high price comes high expectations.- The shave. On my face, the shave is no better than the shave I got from my Remington MS 280 (about $40.00). It didn't seem like the ""pulsonic"" feature helped at all. On my neck, there were spots that I just could not get. I tried shaving in all sorts of directions, but I just could not get all of my neck closely shaved. Generally, it was good enough, but if I wanted to get a really close shave on my neck, I had to bust out the Remington. I saved the best for last: This shaver pulled my hairs. Talk about frustrating and painful. This thing won't be pulling my hairs anymore since I smashed it against the sink in frustration ... embarrassing, I know. But, at least I won't be using this shaver anymore."
4,Good not great,"I pulled the trigger on the $200 razor because I thought it would be much better than my last $80 razor. It is better, I'm just not sure its $120 better. I'm disappointed in it's tendency to miss a few longer whiskers after, say, not shaving over the weekend, and the trimmer location makes it hard to be accurate around the edge of my beard. The razor's ""hygiene"" indicator telling me the shaver needs ""intensive cleaning"" after 3 shaves strikes me as a shameless effort to sell cleaning fluid refills (of course nothing requires you to give it the intensive cleaning at that point). On the up side, I do think the razor does give a closer shave overall to any electric I've used in the past. Just not the stark improvement I expected for the price."
1,Great disappointment,"My wife purchased this shaver for me. I had it two weeks whent the platic tab that immibilizes the shaving head broke off. I returned it to the retailer and they replaced it with a new one. A few days later the same part broke off the new one. I called Braun customer support - what a waste of time!!! I returnnd it to the retailer and they gave me a refund. I bought the Braun series 5 shaver for $100 less and I am thrilled with it. For $200+, I didn't expect it to be so poorly made. Don't waste your time on the series 7 - it is very expensive and made very poorly."
2,"Ok at shaving, but leaves all whiskers on your shirt","I have replaced with all new and cleaned the shaving head assembly many times over, yet this shaver does not collect the stubble hair in its head like razors are supposed to do. Instead, the Braun Series 7- 790cc scatters the stubble all over your shirt. All my Norelco rotary razors always collected all of my whiskers internally to be put in the trash."
2,Braun and Quality is a contradiction,"I have been using Braun shaving systems since the mid 80's. Completely satisfied until purchasing this system. Do not know whether this is due to P&G taking ownership, but they have definitely gone from a top of the line product to not worth the box it came in. My unit has been back for warranty service 4 times since purchase, and I have no confidence that it will last another 4 months. Don't waste your money..on this overpriced headache !!!!!"
1,The Worst Braun Product,"I have used Braun for over 35 years but this product coming out at 21st Century is the WORST! I am very disappointed with this product which comes with a big price tag. I have a sensitive skin and after each use my skin gets extremely irritated and bumpy that I have to apply Hydrocortisone cream to soothe it. The trimmer is worthless and does not do the job. I have decided to go back to razors because I can shave with one stroke and I do not have to pass the shaver on and on many times and burn my skin with the heat. Adding salt to injury I have to use the Braun liquid to clean it each time with additional cost. I would NOT recommend this shaver to anyone. If you are able to test it before buying do it otherwise, either buy a cheaper one or just use the razor."
3,Downgrade from older versions,PROS:Decent shave if your facial hair is <= 1 day growth (see cons)Self-cleaning is decent when the cartridge is relatively newCONS:It will rip hairs out of your face if your beard is too long because of gaps on the outer edges of the foil razorSelf-cleaning is bad when cartridge is mid-to-lowBeard trimmer is useless because it springs out backwardsOver-sized cleaning stationFat power-inverter is at the end of the power cord instead of internalized or in the middle of the power cord.Expensive!
5,Best Ever.,My husband has used a Braun shaver like forever and he says that this is the best one yet.
1,Mediocre shaver and ludicrous Amazon return policy,"The shaver runs hot and gives a mediocre shave at best compared to a good blade. What's even worse is Amazon's ludicrous return policy: no return is permitted for this item because it contains flammable liquids (the cleaning solution), which supposedly would be too dangerous to ship back. If the solution is so dangerous to ship, how and why did they ship it to me in the first place? What a load of bunk!"
1,"Great shape, great clean but not nearly close enough","I have been using my Pulsonic for almost 2 months and I have yet to get a close shave with this razor. I bought this razor because of the new handy shape and cleaning system, but this is just not enough for over $200 dollars. It ;s not close after you shave and even worse an hour or two later. The Braun 360 did a better job but was too hard to hold and manuver. I have been a Braun user that has switched to Norelco.I just purchased a new Norelco Arcitec 1090 to replace it and had to eat the Braun razor because Braun only offers a 30 day money back guarantee. Norelco offers 60 days. My first shave with the Norelco was closer than any shave I got with the Pulsonic. If you buy the Pulsonic make a quick decision on whether you like paying for an inferior shave. The Norelco was easy to clean with warm tap water and required no addional expense.In the contest Between the Pulsonic and the Arcitec, I give 5 stars to the Norelco Arcitec."
3,Not what it's cracked up to be...,"I had an older model of the Clean & Renew system, which I loved. Eventually, the power button broke and the unit would not turn off. My girlfriend got me this new one for Christmas at my behest, and I thought I'd love it.Everything is fine with it except the most important part: The blades are very weak. It takes me over 2x longer to shave than it did with my old unit. The new blade system just doesn't cut it. I have to shave daily no matter what, and I want something that's going to cut quickly and efficiently. I must go over the same areas multiple times, and sometimes press hard to get it to cut like a $200 shaver should cut.That said, I suppose if you have a light beard or thin hair, it might work for you. As far as I'm concerned, it's not worth the money and I'd like mine (or hers) back. These blades are just plain awful."
5,"""The Best Electric Shaver On The Market""","Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic ShaverI replaced my 7 year old ""Braun Syncro"" with a new ""Series 7"". It is undoubtedly the BEST electric shaver that I have ever owned. I wanted to make my ""Syncro"" my second shaver so I went to the Braun Website and decided on the ""7"" almost immediately. I am pleasantly amazed at the improved quality of the shave between the two. I particularly appreciate the capability of the cleaning system to regulate the amount of fluid used based on the amount of time between cleanings; i.e. if the shaver is relatively clean less fluid ids used thus starching the capacity of the tank. I strongly recommend this shaver to anyone!!"
2,"Disapointed, don't buy by price alone","this razor was a dissapointment. commercials...reviwes.....stats all sounded good. truth is the base in smelly and noisy, shaver heats up fast and kinda bruns your skin. the floating head was nice the shave was no good. i use to have a panasonic and replaced it with this....not good. i went back and bought a new panasonic model. so i shaved with the braun and still had stubble in some areas....went over the stubble with my new panasonic and wooosh....GONE!!! so please do yourself a favor...buy a panasonic!!"
2,Not great for me,"I have an average beard, and this razor did a great job on my actual face. The problem was that it just wouldn't pick up the hairs under my jaw and on my neck, even after a month. I finally returned the razor to Braun since I kept having to shave with a regular razor afterwards anyway. Most people seem to have a positive experience, so I would still recommend others try it. I was just one of the few for which it didn't work so well."
2,Sadly dissapppointed,"This is probably the first bad real bad review I have ever given anything in my life. Like everyone else, I read the many 5 star reviews this latest Braun got and decided to purchase it. I was very patient with it, used it for a solid 2 month but didnt like it at all. I have now gone back to using my older Braun, the 7526 which still works a lot better than the 9595 model for me.-If you are not shaving daily which I never do, it can be very uncomfortable, the razor pulls hairs all the time, and simply misses a lot too.-If you have a goatee or something you are trimming around, the way this razor is designed it makes it difficult.-This a very loud razor, not just for cleaning which I can deal with, but when you are using it.-Really the only nice to have was the LCD.-I can't believe I paid $225 for this, at least Braun gave me a refund when I shipped it back to them."
3,Not a wet-dry shaver,"I was disappointed when my husband found out that this is NOT a wet-dry shaver, when he reads the instructions. I thought this is a wet-dry model since the reviews say it is the best on the market. Maybe in the product description should mention this is not a wet-dry model. Anyway, luckily the seller is great that they gave us the full refund of the product (we did not use it). Five star for the seller, three star for the product."
4,Shaves like a Dream,"I bought this new Pulsonic Series 7790cc because my previous model Razor from Braun Series 8had problems with two of them within a year.this model shaves close and comfortable and had no pull on the longer hairs.this model is also easier to clean. expensive, yes but there are NO free lunches out there.Fast shipping from Amazon.com"
5,Cutting Edge,The Braum 7-790cc does a great job for a heavy beard. I tried several of the Norelco shavers and they didn't have the cutting ability as the Braum. I am very pleased with the Braum 7-790cc and would recommend this shaver if you have a heavy beard and need some real cutting power.
2,"Looks great, but disappointing","After reading tons of reviews (majority good)I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He's in the military so he shaves every day. I had high hopes that this would be the answer to outrageously priced razor cartridges, but I'm sorry to say that it wasn't. :( It looks beautiful...no complaints about the design or noise level, it just doesn't give him a close enough shave. He has given it a few weeks, as the product packaging suggests, but it's no better than before. I will be looking into returning it to the manufacturer."
4,Better thatn the 5 Series,"I like this razor better than the Series 5 (8995) because it is much smoother to the face therefore my face is less irritated which is why shave with an electric razor in the first place. Having said that I must say that in terms of shaving performance there is not much difference, you still have to repeat areas to get a really close shave. Overall I am happy with this product and I would recommend it to anyone who gets easily irritated skin, if you are just buying it to replace the 5(8995) I would not probably do it again"
4,Great Electric Razor,"I usually don't use electric razors because it tears up my face no matter how long I use it. I pulled this razor out of the box ... ran it through a cleaning cycle... my face was great!! I shave on a regular (Military), so when I can go a fews days without, I do. Here there is a slight problem, but not enough to give a horrible review, it is a little hard to cut longer hairs. Its not much of a problem I just have to alow for more time to shave (thats why it is not much of a problem)... But in all, I love it!! great electric razor!"
4,Serving its purpose,"I bought this shaver because it was recommended to my by some friends. This is my first real dive into an electric shaver. I can say that if I work at it I can get a shave as close as my 3 blade razors. I do have to use multiple directions with the shaver and in some cases press pretty hard, but it will get the job done. I am glad that I don't need to use a blade razor anymore. I would recommend this shaver to someone looking for an electric shaver.."
5,braun pulsonic for a gift,"just wanted to say i recently purchased this braun electric shaver for a christmas gift.the fellow i purchased it for is on blood thinners for a heart condition that he has.he was complaining that when he shaves,because of the medications he would get red lines on the cheeks of his face,and neck.and he was contemplating buying a electric shaver,but complained when ever he would use one it would always pull and never feel like it was getting the shave close enough.well he absolutely loves this new braun shaver and swears he'll never go back to a blade and cream again. now i wish i would of tried it out first myself before i gave it to him!!!! oh well. good job braun,keep up the technology!!"
5,amazing shave!!!,I am VERY impressed by this. It was a bit expensive but it was worth it to me. I upgraded from an old norelco rotary/circular wet/gel shaver that just didnt do a great job. I was worried my skin would like like a dry shaver but amazingly it works great and doesnt bother my skin!!!
5,AMAZING,"I was hesitant with this razor at first, thinking with this price if I don't like it i will have wasted my money. This razor though is as close the fusion razor blades. It was amazing that it was so close, and even better it didn't rip my face off either like some Remington models. Braun puts a lot of research and effort behind their razors and it really shows with this Series 7. The only complaint i would have is that the battery last too long, i have used it for a week and just to see how the battery held up i didn't charge it, and the damn thing won't die. There is a smart cleaning system that determines how hard it must clean in order to make the razor hygienic again without wasting cleaning fluid. Overall this is one of the best razors i have ever had, I love it and I would not trade it in for anything else. Oh yea, did i mention it will tell you when to change the foil and razors, cause it does that too."
2,electric razor bust,"I have never found an electric razor that works that well,a close shave, and this one is not that much different. The clean and recharge system it great."
3,"Great Shave, UNTIL it wouldn't start.",I've had the shaver for 6 weeks and I love the shave. This morning I pushed the button and nothing. Fully charged and cleaned but it won't run. We'll see how the repair/replacement goes.
3,"Good shave, poor reliability","Five stars for the shaver, 1 star for the liquid cleaning system. I've had the system for only 3 months and it's started to leak during the cleaning process. For a shaver costing twice other competing models, this is extremely disappointing."
3,Bad position of flip out trimmer,"I have used this razor for over a year. It is my third Braun. It shaves ok, about a good as any other Braun, but when they redesigned their shavers from the previous generation, they relocated the pop out trimmer. Every now and then, I trim the back of my neck using a hand held mirror. The way they positioned the trimmer, you can't see where you are trimming because the body of the razor blocks the view of the trimmer head. It may sound like a trivial thing, but it is actually a huge pain. I had to buy a separate trimmer as a result. Bad design on a pretty good, but pricy shaver."
1,Died after 1.5 years,"I bought this shaver from Amazon in November, 2009. Today it died. When I turn it on, the switch light is on, but the shaver doesn't come on. I bought it because I saw so many positive reviews here! It does give a decent shave (except under my chin), but it makes a big mess with hairs everywhere. have to shave above the sink all the time!"
2,Braun just advertising...,The Braun Pulsonic is just like any other electric shaver out there... the self cleaning feature is nice... but I wish I had purchased a cheaper razor because the quality of shave is no better than the Norelco shavers at less than 1/2 the price.
3,Disappointed,This item said that it gave a close shave and is supposed to be one of the best out there. My fiance tried it for 2-3 weeks like the box suggests but he still does not get a close shave. Very disappointed.
2,It's OK,"I have been using Remington shavers for years and decided to step up to a better product....so I thought. This Braun seems put together well, runs great, and the cleaning operation seemed to work well but left a little residue on the screen. That being said this product doesn't shave as well as my old Remington and cost 3 times as much so I will be going back. The Remington is also better at cleaning up any longer growth and trimming neck lines etc. I found that the Braun was ok in flat areas like the cheek but lacked in the neck area, the ability to actually shave if you have let your hair grow for several days, and just getting a close shave."
1,"Beware! Blades dulled quickly, shaver battery died, and trimmer broke off this poorly made shaver!","At first this shaver worked well. However, the blades dulled quickly, the battery died, and the trimmer broke off the shaver. A Braun authorized repair company fixed the trimmer but claimed the battery was fine - notwithstanding the fact that the battery dies mid-shave unless I plug the shaver into an outlet. Given the price, the quality control is unacceptable. I would never buy this shaver again."
2,Can't imagine why...,"I can't imagine why this razor gets the high reviews it does. It takes me 10-15 minutes to shave with it. I have normal hair and have never had a problem with shaving. OK, it cleans...great. As far as a razor is concerned, it's only adequate."
2,Panasonic ES8243A 68 bucks for a sleeper hit,"This shaver performs like it's worth 20 but costs over 200.That's funny because the PocketGo should be worth 100 but is under 20It takes 7 min to shave a 3/5 with the Pulsonic.It takes 10 min to shave a 4/5 with the PocketGo.Do the math.Better yet, go to wegotbetterdeals and buy the sleeper hit of the decade: the Panasonic ES8243A for 68 bucks.It takes 3 min to get a shave better than the Mach 3. Shave wet with Aveeno Therapeutic gel (4 bucks) or ""dry"" with Williams Lectric Shave Ultra (3 bucks).Don't believe the Pulsonic VIBRATOR hype.I gave mine back to my local bestbuy for a full refund a month after being disappointed every day.Now I look forward to getting a smooth shave with no cuts after my hot shower with the Panasonic.I carry the PocketGo when I travel."
5,Awesome - works as advertised,"Read some mixed reviews on this product prior to purchasing. I've owned a lot of electric shavers in my time, but this one is superior. A little noisier then I would have liked, but more than made up for with the auto-cleaning function. Just pop it in the charger unit, and it cleans and charges itself automatically. Ready to go the next time around. Also gives the closest shave I've ever had from an electric shaver. Good buy."
4,"Great, but could be better","I upgraded from a 9000 series and was blown away by how smooth it feels when shaving. My previous one felt pretty rough. I don't notice that it shaves any closer really, but it just feels nicer when I shave and that's good enough for me.My one gripe with it is that the flip out cutter is smaller and not as good as the 9000 series shaver. I use it a lot when I just want to trim my facial hair rather than shave it all off."
1,not better than norelco,"I liked my old Norelco better! This new Braun takes me 3-4x as long to shave my face. Many hairs simply do not get touched and I have to make 5-6 passes...very frustrating. For being as expensive as it is, this shaver should cut close and do it reasonably fast. Every shave is an act of frustration."
4,Takes a little getting used to,Have had Braun shavers for years now. Was a little surprised that my face took a couple of weeks to get used to this one. This new cutting head does a lot better than my old Braun (Model 7526) in some areas like my upper lip and my chin. I think the much faster pulsing of the cutter heads helps. But I still like my older Braun better for other areas like my neck. I'm hoping my neck just needs to get used to it as well. I definitely like the pop-out trimmer on the old Braun better. This new one sticks out far from the razor body and is narrow and is a bit akward to use.
2,Bad Purchase,"I had a Braun Series 5 for about 5 years and it did a great job, so when it quit working I ""upgraded"" to the Series 7. What a mistake. This things does nothing very well and costs much more. It pulls hair, doesn't shave close and the postion of the trimmer makes it very difficult to see what you are doing. Avoid this shaver."
4,"Starts out excellent and comfortable, but...","This expensive razor started out as the best ever, but after several months, it is slower, the shave is not as close and it is more irritating to the skin. I have a light beard and sensitive skin. All razors, blade or electric, have caused irritation to my skin. This is still a good razor."
4,Review My Shaver - AE,"This was my first electric shaver, before I had always used the razor, but my skin is very sensitive and shaving every day was often an isssue. This shaver solved my problem!However, the shave is not as deep as the one achieved with a razor, but it can get very close if one has time to catch the hair in the most difficult areas.I would definitely buy it again (or ask it as a gift as i did!)"
5,Braun Shaver 7-Very Satisfied,I got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. He is extremely picky about his shave and equipment and has had only positive comments about it. I am relieved!
4,Best shaver I ever used,"I've been using Norelco electric shavers for at least 40 years except for a short time when I used a Braun. This Braun is much better than the previous one I used and Norelco never gave me this close a shave. It is a bit expensive, including cleaning fluid and replacement heads, but I love it.Braun 790CC Series 7 Men's Cordless Shaver"
1,Poor warrenty,Bought new Braun series 7 - 790 cc lasted 45 days . The shave wasok but not the best but when it quit working I followed directions and sent it back and never heard another word from them.Try and call some one from Braun and all you get is pre recorded messages no people!and no satifaction with poor customer reliabilty. will not buy again that is even if I get my money back. poor poor beware they do not care about you.
2,Expensive shaver -mediocre shave,"I concur with many of the reviews that say this shaver does not provide a close shave. It is very expensive, but does seem very well made. I will only use it for travel and will rely on a blade and shaving cream when at home."
2,"Works fine, but not worth the price","I hate shaving with a blade and would pay a lot for an electric razor that would give as close of a shave. Unfortunately, the Braun 9595, while certainly a good electric razor, doesn't match the closeness of a blade. With my previous electric razor, I would use it and then shave with a blade for maximum closeness, which I was hoping to avoid with this one. Between the over $200 price of the blade on top of buying the monthly cleaning cartridges, it's just not worth it."
1,Buyer beware,"I bought one of these about 18 months ago. So far I have had it repaired twice and at this point, I am on Amazon looking to replace it as it is now not functioning again. I have been using electric shavers for almost 20 years and will never buy a Braun product again."
1,Overpriced piece of junk,"I purchased this based on positive reviews, however I am now convinced many of those reviews are suspect. After a year's use I have concluded this is an overpriced piece of junk. The closeness of the shave is poor at best, and it does a terrible job of shaving under the nose. The cleaning station lights have completely stopped working, and the pivoting head lock for under the nose shaving no longer works. Save your money and look at other manufacturers."
2,No Worth The Hype!!,"My Braun 7526 model, after 8 years, is starting to die down on me. So I came here to read reviews on other models, and was pretty hyped up about all the positive reviews of the pulsonic model. I ordered it, looked great and took it for a test drive.Well, I was very disappointed. It really didn't provide the closeness that everyone claimed it does. It left quite a lot of stubble and long hairs on my face. I thought, well, maybe I need an adjustment period, but day after day the same thing.Finally, I decided to use my old braun after shaving with the pulsonic and I couldn't believe how much hair my older model started clearing off my face. I could hear the blades cutting all the hair the newer model had left behind!Well, needless to say, I have returned the product back to Braun for a refund. I am still using my older model and have decided to just order the same one again. Very big disappointment on what was supposed to be this great new technology."
5,Braun Series 7,"Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic ShaverVery good product, excellent price, fast shipping."
5,I didn't know what I was missing!,"Fantastic shave. Easy to use, smooth and quiet. Only down side is that it is a clean-aholic. Cleans after every use, so leave it off the charger between uses if you don't want to run the clean cycle every time... otherwise, it is great!"
4,Braun 790cc Electric Razor,The product is fine....but I am not happy about paying $229.98 and now you are selling the product for $199.99......
4,Glad I got the product,"The product met with my needs for shaving. I had looked for a good shaving head system. This one will take care of my aging face and clean without using so much that I get burns on my face. I like the cleaning holder system. I have found that I keep the shaving head clean and always ready for shaving. I have a soft pouch for caring as I travel. The hard case sure makes the item bulky in the overnighter. The motor noise is no more noiser than the other shavers. I am sure that I will use this Braun as my major razor cutter. Try to keep this series on the market so the replacements and cleaning parts are kept on the shelve. I see they are in most the major stores like Walmart, Walgreens and others."
5,A must Own,This shaver is the best one to own.The claims of this shaver are on the money.I have owned Braun shavers and they are the best brand for closeness and dependability.
5,Best electric shaver I have ever used.,"At first I thought it was too expensive for an electric shaver, but I was tired of the burning and stubble left behind from other electric shavers that I decided it was time to spend the extra money and see if it was worth it, was it ever, this shaver is the best electric shaver I have ever used. I would go weeks with just trimming the hair back to avoid fully shaving, razors were getting so expensive and you have to throw them away after 1 or 2 shaves. I recommend this shaver to everyone and believe me when I say it is well worth the money, I would have paid more now that I know how nice it really is. The shaver stays very cool throughout the shave and once you know how to get the best results the shave goes even quicker, one of the best things about it is cleaning, you don't have to do anything except push a button."
2,Stops while Shaving,"First I been buying Braun Electric Shavers for over 10 years and never had a problem till now. When I received the 790CC shaver (Braun's best and most expensive) back in March 2009, I was very pleased with it. But now 6 months later I found while shaving (plug or Cordless)IT SHUTS OFF DURING THE SHAVE!!! At first I though it needed cleaning but it did it after being cleaned. Right now I'm using a manual blades to shave because the shaver shuts off constantly. Not sure if this is a bug in there system or Amazon got a bad a batch of shavers from Braun.Jay G"
3,Disappointed with Braun,"Having been an exclusive Braun user since 1963 (47 years) and having had the earlier version of this shaver I am sad to say that I am deeply disappointed. It shaves okay most of the time, but the cutter for trimming is difficult to open (sometimes requiring two hands). Worse than that is the ""pulling""of hairs. OUCH! Previous shavers didn't do that and I hardly need to prove that I am using it correctly after 47 years with Braun and being on my second Pulsonic. (The first one wouldn't charge. I hope that you send a copy of this to Braun."
4,Braun Series 7,"I have always had an older Braun that I used for a ""quick once over"", but always used a blade for a truly close shave. My older Braun finally gave out (over 20 years)and I bought the Series 7. What an amazing electric shaver! I now use my new Braun for my morning shave. Although not quite as close as a blade, this does a great job. I would highly recommend this product!"
2,Tugs hairs and shaves no closer than 20 year-old shaver,"I bought this to replace a low-end Braun shaver that is about 20 years old. I wasted my money. This does not shave any closer than my old shaver, so for all the so-called technological advances in terms of pivoting head and dual foils, and all the bells and whistles, etc., nothing has been gained in performance. Furthermore, this shaver tugs hairs from time to time if you don't go really slowly. I'll grant that it's quieter, which is nice, but that's the only improvement I'm seeing."
5,This shaver is great,"Absolutely the best shaver I have ever used. I can not believe how close close of a shave I get. Also, it tells you how much shave cleaner you have left aand when it is empty. It is not cheap, but WORTH EVERY PENNY."
4,Tried Germany; bought in USA,"I have had the old Braun Flex shaver for years and wanted to update. On a recent trip to Germany, I thought I'd get one there. NOT ! The Euro stopped that very quickly. At approx. $1.50 per Euro, and the price there being E 300 (that's about $450), I passed on that option immediately. Bought it on Amazon for $220.The only thing more satisfying than getting my Braun Pulsonic at half the price....is that it is everthing I expected and more. A smooth, close shave and a cleaning system which leaves me ""ready to go"" anytime I need to shave. Execellent....."
5,An electric razor that actually works,"Quite simply, this is the first electric razor I've ever owned that actually shaves as close or closer than a disposable and is an actual pleasure to use."
4,Braun Pulsonic--9595,"I have a very tough beard. If I shave(razor) at 5AM I have a shadow by 6AM. The Braun 9595 is the best electric razor I've used so far. The shave gives me a very smooth shave that lasts most of the day. If I choose not to use my safety razor (for the closest shave I can get) I will shave with the Braun twice in a day. The pop-up trimmer allows me to get to some difficult spots and trims very easily. Braun has made the cleaning and charging a snap. Plug the shaver in, charge, clean afterwards and get one of the best shaves possible!"
2,Does not last over time,I have owned this shaver for over 2 1/2 years and have had problems with base contact and shaver while cleaning; have to move shaver to make contact. Shaver position Lock never worked properly and developed crack in shaver head holder housing. I have had to replace shaving heads too many times. I now trying the Panasonic ES-LA93-K Arc IV
3,"new technology, but really a closer shave?","After purchasing the shaver I expected a new quality close shave that also makes shaving easier when it comes to those stubbern little hair that just refuse to yield.The unit is very large (had to fit into my case), does not have a blade protection cover other then the one covering the entire unit making transportation even bulkier. The shave took some time to get used to, but I feel it is no better then the one of units half this price. The power cable is a non standard cable, which means you cannot rely on your friends if you are on a longer trip. Time will tell how the cleaning process will maintain the unit."
5,Perfeect,"this little thing works wonders and its definately worth the money. Also, the popup trimmer is probably the best I've used."
5,My face has never been happier,"I bought this for Father's Day gift and he loved it so much he recommended I get one for myself. So I did! This gives the closest shave I have ever gotten with anything other than a razor. That statement used to make me prefer a razor until I got this product. I don't get irritated skin anymore, and I actually look forward to shaving everyday now. Sometimes twice!Definitely worth the price of admission, and I saved by purchasing from Amazon!"
5,Great Shaver!,"I purchased the shaver for my friend, he really likes the shaver although I must admit, the first one stopped working after only 4 weeks. Amazon was really great about sending a replacement pretty quickly."
3,"Good,but.........","It is a very good coverage of SQL standard, but I didn't like the style of writing. Just like many SQL books you have to spend some time looking at the sample database in order to understand the concept.This to me is a waste of time and annoying.The difference is clear if you compare it to other books like Date's ""Introduction to Database Systems""."
1,power lifting belt definitely not even close,this is no power lifting belt. there is no support at all as the inside mat'l must be cardboard or something ....
1,"not delievered, I Purchused this through Amazon.com",Sang A Deal has not dellivered my DARKLAND Software. I ordered it april 30th and it's stell not here. June 1
2,minimally impressed,"I ordered this book hoping to get a compilation of good minimalist architecture. What I received was a selection of a few very good projects amidst a lot of mediocre architecture. Minimalism is a catch all word...just because a house has white walls and a lot of glass does not make it 'minimal'. I expected much more analysis and critique than what is written.In terms of the book itself: There are some very good images and photography with help to offset the bad choice of font and standard layout.I would recommend this book as a good coffee table book, but nothing more than that."
4,Overview,"This book is a very intense and enlightening book that covers tough subjects throughout the Old Testament. Though it is probably not for the average person, students of the Bible and especially the Old Testament will want to look at this book to gain further understanding from a great scholar in Old Testament studies. The author is a former professor of mine whom I learned much from and helped me to choose an Old Testament emphasis for my master's work. This book is detailed and can be used to topically search tough passages from the Old Testament Law. An excellent tie to the New Testament is done throughout the book as well."
1,NOT for Lodoss War fans!,"If you're a Lodoss War fan, avoid this title. Despite it's billing, it has no tie-in with the Lodoss world besides a 2 minute history intro and a couple of names thrown out at the very beginning.Beyond that, the story is indifferent, and the animation is poor. It has none of the sharp style and bright contrasts that typically makes for good anime, coming across blurry and dull instead (and that goes for both the animation AND the story!).Imagine that someone took a water-color version of the Lodoss War, erased the story, and then left it out in the rain overnight. This is what you'd have left. Go see the original again, or try the 'Chronicles of the Heroic Knight' (now out on DVD). Give this one a miss."
2,Definitely not as good as it should have been...,"Though I was giving it the benefit of the doubt, Legend of Crystania proved to be quite a disappointment. The story line is less than underdeveloped. In the short length of less than 1.5 hours, there isn't much time to make good story plot, but they managed to put forth very little effort. I was pretty disappointed about the fact that they even have a BIO section for all of the characters and state that Ashram and Pirotess are the same people from lodoss war, but act/look nothing like themselves. I have not yet seen the series, but i might imagine it to be a little bit better due to fewer time constraints... but I won't get my hopes up quite yet."
1,Avoid this video,"This is listed as part of the Lodoss setting. Other than the names, it has nothing to do with them. And the names are on wrong races and faces to top it off. The story is weak, and the animation is bad. I regret buying this dvd VERY MUCH."
3,The sequel to record of Lodoss war series,"This anime is perhaps best thought of as an expansion video for Lodoss war.The reason being that there are some instances where knowledge of the previous series would clarify plot points.The animation is not as smooth as Manga although the musical score and the voice casting are good.The video has the typical fantasy setting of an ancient world mixed with monsters and powerful gods.Crystania is a competent anime with interesting pale drawing techniques(A faded cell animation), and a decent plot.Although not up to the standard of Lodoss War, crystania makes a decent purchase given that it has no overtly bad points.It also works well as a stand alone animation which means that viewing the previous series is recommended but not necessary"
1,Way below expectations,"I bought this video in hopes of finding a good sequel to one of my favorite animes of all time: Record of Lodoss War. Not only did the animation look like it had been washed out by the rain, but the plot was definitely in need of something. If you are a die-hard Lodoss fan, like I am, it might spark a tiny flare of interest even after you've seen its horrible plot, but if you're just a normal anime-goer, STAY AWAY! This is an insult to the original series."
2,It's not Lodoss War...but even then...,"Ok...if you are looking for a sequel to Lodoss War, then this is not where you wanna go. It's nothing like Lodoss War, and you only have Ashram and Pirotesse returning from the original. But even putting that aside, it wasn't that great of a movie. First off, it was a good deal bloodier than Lodoss War was, so if you're squemish, don't bother. Secondly, a lot of parts of the movie, even though I tried and tried to make sense of them, I could not. It was not very well written, and from beginning to end, just made little sense. Don't get me wrong; it wasn't entirely bad, but it was more bad than good. I say don't waste your money."
2,Ugh!,Very bad... not much of character development... not much of a plot... Aviod this is you are a Lodoss fan.
4,Crystania is quite good,"A simple story of a battle between good and evil, pits young prince Radon against shape-changing adversaries in a far off land. Being written by Ryo Mizuno, you can expect a lot of bright visuals and fine acting (though almost every single word is screamed or shouted), though at times it is a bit intense for the younger kids it is aimed at."
4,Loddess Wars,"This off-shoot (Not to be confused with Cronicles of the Heroic Knight) of Loddoss Wars takes place way after. If you haven't seen Loddess, you can still enjoy this well made film. It tell the story of a ruler who wants to protect his people and take them to the nearly unreachable kingdom of Crystania. Needless to say, this stts off the adventure of a small band on a quest not soon forgotten. This is indeed, one for the collection."
3,Could be great but has major flaws...,"Down to the point, Legend of Crystania isn't a complete flop. Truthfully, the story could have been very good and captivating. It however isn't back to the old loved style of Record of Lodoss War. The animation can look wonderful at times, but usually lacks color and has very thick, black lines for details. As for the story, it seems a bit rushed and lacks depth in character. The main characters don't have real personalities and thus, you don't get attached to them. The story is pretty good, but it takes time and effort to figure out the whole story. After watching it, you feel empty, and the story just doesn't make since, like bits and pieces were left out. It does add a bit more to the Lodoss Saga and is worth you time at least. So all in all, Legend of Crystania isn't great due to rushed story and very unrealistic characters... But before you just blow it off, you should at least rent it and see it for yourself."
3,Poor animation disappoining plot....,"Actually I always and still want to buy Record of Lodoss War, but because in Germany they didn't have the English Version I discovered Legend of Crystania and thought it might be a good replacement for Lodoss War. But no, instead we got this flop.I was very disappointed in this movie.I mean I've read some Fantasy stories myself and found most of them very, very suspenseful and exciting. What disappoints me most is the animation of the characters. Just look at the colors; almost lifeless and without emotion. Okay, the plot for a fantasy is quite okay, but not as suspenseful as I have hoped for. You can be lucky that I'm a reasonable person, otherwise I'd give this movie only 2 stars."
1,This movie was simply awful.,"I thought Record of Lodoss War was fantastic on many levels. However Crystania bears virtually no relation to Lodoss at all other than the fact that Ashram and Pirotesse are in it. When did Pirotesse become a weakling that couldn't defend herself? When did Ashram become one of the good guys? The animation is as similiar to Lodoss as Peanuts is to Disney's Fantasia. I have to disagree with the other reviews about the voice acting, it was bad also. The story was terrible and seems to have been concocted by someone's 10 year old nephew. Do yourself a favor and rent this movie first (you will see I was so disappointed) if you are truly interested."
2,Crystania - :sigh:,"Although the music is pretty decent, the voice-acting fair, and the story interesting, the Legend of Crystania simply isn't worth it. Record of Lodoss War was fantastic, and Crystania simply doesn't earn the title of 'sequel' for Lodoss. The animation was poor (Lodoss' animation may not have been fantastic [ie the dragons] but it was still great), the shading / color scheme was terrible, and the story did get rather dull at times. It's as if they were trying to leech off Lodoss' fame to bring in a few quick bucks."
2,No sequel to Lodoss Wars,"I was very disappointed in this video, as it was represented as a follow up to Lodoss Wars. The art is only okay and the coloring pastel, much like the personalities of the characters. The only two characters continuing from Lodoss are unrecognizable and are not in leading roles. I'm sure I'd have liked this better if they'd left it to its own merits and not tried the flimsy tie in to Lodoss Wars."
2,It's a very medicore sequel to a fantastic show,This story takes place long after the Lodoss series. Ashram leads the Marmo to a new home and makes a deal with a god spirit to save them. He is possessed by the spirit and becomes an evil tyrannical ruler.This series disappointed the heck out of me. The only character that you will recognize from Lodoss is Pirotess. Her appearance and attitude are completely different. She may as well be a different character all together. The animation is not that good and the voice actors are awful. The whole premise and story are not bad though; but the bottom line is I don't think you should spend money on this anime.
4,cheery,I have a 5 year old who has a hard time getting over things that don't go his way. I was glad to try a book that might suggest options to him without them coming from me - as he is often resistant to my suggestions. No miracles but I think we might try reading it every week or more and see how things sink in now that he's in kindergarten. The pictures are fun and inviting to turn the next page.
5,Time Travel in a Seven CD Box!,"This is AMAZING. Everything from the thorough documentation in the liner notes to the way the chronological presentation gives an audio history of pop music in the decade is perfect. Even though licensing restrictions exclude a lot of significant music, it's still a really fun musical history lesson. It's also a powerful mnemonic. Put it on and be transported to wherever you were when these songs were popular!"
3,No Future,"This surely is the death drive. Deathly because it is nowhere near the jouissance of living `queer.' The problem is that Edelman has defined the queer. To Edelman, the Queer disrupts the Symbolic with an anti-politic, anti-oppositional oppositional movement. Because the Queer only disidentifies, the proper queer project now, after Edelman, would be to repudiate the work he set forth, or at least not pay attention to it, the %.1 percent who (can) read it. An interesting and obnoxious book. If you follow the trends that are pioneered in the very fetish-y Duke University Press, pick this one up, now."
2,A so-so text,"""Exploring Language"" has a good format--thematically related groups of essays mostly on contemporary issues. However, in each succeeding edition I was required to use, I have found some of the most effective essays replaced by those seemingly less related to the the themes of the sections they are in. Further, as we all know, textbooks often are extremely overpriced. I find it disheartening that this anthology is needlessly revised so often that re-sale value is short-lived, which is a hardship for many of my students. Most of my students need to sell back texts outside their majors. Instead, they end up being stuck with books that inevitably will languish on shelves, collecting dust, or in adding to a landfill. It is for these reasons I would rate this as a so-so textbook."
2,Good book 1979 but not today!,"If I had buy this book in the 80:s I should for sure give this book 4-5 stars. The SWAT Team Manual was good in the early 80:s but it is out of date today. The book give you basic on how how to train SWAT and clearing/enter room and stairs. I think for sure the book was good in the 80:s but today the tactics are out of date (well not everything but almost).If you are interested in SWAT training and tactics there is better books today. Remeber I have not yet seen one book that cover everything from room combat too search a stair (this book actually cover it, but littlebit out of date) you have too buy at least 4-5 or more books too cover all these subjects. One book that cover ""clearing"" of these subjects are Tactical Advantage by Suarez."
1,Don't be fooled!,"Don't be fooled! This book looks like it was written by a fourth grader with a $3.00 budget and a 2 day deadline! The pages seem to be xeroxed, and the illustrations were apparently done by a child. The ""tactics"" described are hideously superficial. (As an example, I just now flipped open to a random page. Here is what the book explains with regard to the subject of hand signals): ""They are extremely effective as long as everyone knows what they mean and can see you giving them.""That's it. That's all it says. Does it give specific examples of hand signals? No. Does it go into any detail whatsoever? No. The rest of the book is equally informative. Man, I really wish you could see these illustrations. Seriously guys, save yourself some money. Don't buy this book. You'll be sorry."
4,Cold Burn,This is the third of the Steve Cline Mysteries I have read since purchasing my Kindle and they just keep getting better and better. Looking forward to the next one. I love mysteries and horses and books which deal with horses so this and the first 2 were right up my alley.
3,Not Good For Lit Classes,"I'm taking a Literature Class on Milton this semester at University. I bought the Kindle Version of the book so I wouldn't have to buy or carry around the giant text book for the class. However, this book disappointing. After the first class I noticed problems.1. Some of the words have been changed. Take for example Sonnet 19. The text in this book reads ""When I consider how my life is spent"" (Line 1) The sonnet is supposed to read ""When I consider how My LIGHT is spent"" (Line 1). This one word difference makes a huge difference in the poem.2. I also wish translations of his Latin poems were included. For the price I feel like I should have gotten more poems."
5,best,"this hat is made very well and ca endure very strong weather. truly, i think, this proves how strong the long horns are. this is a very confribal hat and a must have for eneny long horn fan."
5,A Wish Realized,"This was a wish of my youngest daughter who has sought the book for some 10 years. It holds special meaning, so when we found it on Amazon we had to buy it. Wonderful product.I great shape."
3,Very enjoyable book,"I had never read a book by Grace Livingston Hill. After reading a sample of the book , I found that I wanted to purchase the book so I could find out what was going to happen next with with Aunt Crete. I Want to read more of her books. I would recommend this book to everyone."
5,Cinderella redux,"Total fairy tale! Sweet long suffering aunt is rescued from her oppressive relatives by a 'handsome prince' in the form of a rich, kindhearted nephew. The good characters are REALLY good & the bad ones are shrewish. Not as preachy as other stories of hers but definitely a message about the just receiving their rewards!"
2,Not what I expected,"The book arrived on time and the price was reasonable. It was in great shape. No discredit to the seller, but this book did not provide the information I was expecting. It is ""just OK"", and I would not advise it for people who want insight into caring for their lawn. I loved some of the smaller booklets that I have by this author."
3,Turkey Hunting,"An OK book, but I've seen better. It sounds like Mr. Phillips is telling other people's successes and none of his own. His only experiences seem to be making mistakes. Yes it is great to learn from other people's mistakes but I also want to hear about their successes. Buy at your own risk."
4,Assault on Mexico,"I found this an easy book to read. It focuses of the early Mexican American War. It gives a good background of the war and focuses on Zachary Taylor's Invasion of Northern Mexico. There are good accounts and maps of the early battles of Resaca De La Palma and Monterrey and then the Battle of Buena Vista after Taylor had lost his regular infantry and had only newly arrived militia regiments. There are only a few maps (6) but they are excellent, showing troop dispositions during the battles. The book is an excellent resource for Taylor's campaign in the early War. It contains no information about the Mexico City campaign, which is outside the scope of the book. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about the Mexican American War."
5,An absorbing and informative survey of military tactics,"Climax At Buena Vista: The Decisive Battle Of The Mexican-American War by western historian and author David Lavender is a solidly researched military history and descriptive accounting of the decisive territory battle that took place between the United States and Mexico in 1847. General Zachary Taylor and roughly 4,500 American army regulars battled General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna with a force of 20,000 Mexican soldiers. Superb maneuvering and regrouping tactics caused what should have been a rout of the American troops by the Mexican forces, into military battlefield draw, and which would ultimately compelled Mexico to sue for peace. An absorbing and informative survey of military tactics, combined with a compelling narrative of the dynamics and relative morality of a war that was ultimately an American grab for more land, Climax At Buena Vista reveals the enduring impact the conflict had on subsequent Mexican and American histories."
4,Laugh Out Loud,"Once I started The Skin Game, I could not put it down. It was a great and funny read, I laughed out loud many times. I look forward to Mr. Wilkins providing some more laughs in his next book."
5,The Skin Game,Treat yourself to the comic escapades of a variety of eccentric characters playing their own game within a dubious justice system. I laughed out loud reading this book. You will too!
5,A quick and fun read,"This is a well written, witty quick read centered around various Atlantic City capers written from the perspective of a struggling attorney. Reminescent of Breslin's ""The Gang that Couldn't Shoot Straight,"" a fun, humorous romp through the judicial system of a well-known beachside town. Couldn't put it down!"
4,history of kentucky basketball dvd,"I bought this dvd for my husband, who is an avid Kentucky fan. It gave a good overall history of the team but did not represent the past as indepth as I would have liked it to have."
3,Strange Organization,"As many books written before computers the exercises in this book crumble before a program as Mathematical Explorer by Wolfram [Here at Amazon for 75 bucks]. In fact most are done with no strain on a hand calculator [I use an old Hewlett Packard 48g which you can buy here but hasn't been made, new, for years] . So, basically, all you are learning from the exercises is how to program your computer or calculator .The author uses a style which presents a calculation without explaining how to do it for 70 more pages. I presume this is to make one &#65533;think for themselves&#65533; but I will dream on what I choose not what someone thinks that I should.By reason of its organization this is a hard book for self study. The facts are there, however. Although I have no alternative there must be one."
5,Nice speakers for the money,"These speakers are a great blend of quality and price. They're just 6 1/4"" h x 2 1/4"" w x 3"" d but they deliver good sound, were very easy to set up, and are light weight but well made. I bought a black pair and a light blue pair for my two teenagers and both of them said the speakers are very cool. The big selling points for me were the simple but creative design, a very impressive choice of colors, a brand that I trust, a fantastic price and, most importantly, a manual dial on one of the speakers so they can adjust the volume (something both of them had wanted). I have only one very small complaint: there's no visible marker on the dial so they can see how high they're turning up the volume. They have to play a sound in order to gauge the sound level. Great speakers for the money; my kids and I are very happy I got them. I did a lot of comparison shopping before I bought these and don't think you could find a better balance of style, quality and price."
3,"Not too bad, but not great.","The sound quality on these speakers is pretty bad. Not horrible, but tinny. They leave much to be desired.If you want to hook up your mp3 player to some speakers, get a cable to connect it to your stereo. It costs about a third of what these speakers cost. If you just need something to rattle on in the background, these speakers will fit the bill."
4,Very good product set within the price range,"This is a very good set of speakers with a low price tag. I have used it with my laptop and desktop computer and it works really well. I have used it to listen to music, play games or view college lectures, and it creates enough high-quality sound to cover my 1 Bedroom apt!However, the glitches in the product come into picture when you are trying to put it to a limit. If you are a gaming wizz or a rock fan and want to have surround sound effects with high bass/treble, then you might want to spend some extra bucks and get a higher end version like Gigaworks from Creative. The voice quality is not adequate for such purposes."
4,Good for just playing windows sounds and listening to google video,not for the audiophile but for basic uses it is just what you need it doesn't have a bulky sub box like all the other speakers out their so its good for a small desktop.
5,Are You Ready For Some College Football?,"The Waterboy is a very funny film starring Adam Sandler as a dimwitted waterboy who vent his frustration at his aggressors by becoming a powerful defensive tackle for a little-known college football program. Kathy Bates and Henry Winkler were great in their respective roles, and the cameo appearances by Dan Patrick, Lee Corso, Lawrence Taylor, Lynn Swann, etc. were a treat. The Waterboy is a perfect movie for any college football and Adam Sandler fan."
5,This is one of Adam Sandler's best movies.,"The Waterboy is a movie that doesn't require a lot of brain power to figure out, but it's loaded with comedy and hilarious lines from Adam Sandler. One particular part of the movie that I love is when he is in a college class dealing with the agression center of animals and Bobby is asked why alligators are such aggressive creatures. Since his Mama was supposedly right about everything, his answer was ""Mama says that alligators are angry 'cause they got all those teeth and no toothbrush."" That's comedy, man! Simple comedy, maybe, but it's funny all the same! This is definitely a must-have for any Adam Sandler fan. If you don't like Adam Sandler, then you're not going to like this movie. End of story."
5,The Waterboy,"It arrived on time and in perfect shape. Adam Sandler is great. He is a very good actor and I loved the movie, Thank You."
5,Waterboy,Gave as a gift to someone with the nickname of Waterboy who loved it and watched it a few times
4,lulz,"Adam Sandler is especially funny in his role as Bobby Boucher, a mama's boy with dreams of playing football. Kathy Bates really shines in her role as his mother, and the two of them make a good team, acting their roles to complement one another nicely. The actress who plays Vicki also does a great job in her role and plays a nice complement to Bobby's naivete.Overall this is a good film, and one that Sandler plays well. Whether or not you're a Sandler fan, you should be able to enjoy this movie!"
5,"Stupid, But Hilarious",Adam Sandler couldn't have done a better job on a movie than the WATERBOY. I saw it five times and it still is funny to me. Now I am going to buy the DVD of the movie. If you want to see a good Adam Sandler Movie see the WATERBOY. If I was allowed I would give it 6 stars.
1,I laughed only once throughout this entire film...,Adam Sandler is funnier than this movie allows. The only audience for this film is nitwits. Don't expect Happy Gilmore comedy..you won't get it here.
3,Time Running out for Sandler,"Although the Waterboy, was yet another funny movie by Sandler, you can tell his routine is running dry. Personaly I found this movie predictiable, and very poor in some of his jokes where his stupid faces no longer let him off the hook. He better go back to quality acting like the Wedding Singer or find himself out in the cold as yet another outcast of Hollywood.But, the movie did have its origional parts which brought up the laughs and the ratings.Dont see this movie unless your in it for a laugh only, not a serious movie with a plot."
3,Torn,"This movie is very funny in some aspects, however it's very hard to laugh or enjoy in comparison to Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison. I really loved Adam Sandler, however any movie made after Billy or Happy just seemed to lag off really badly, (i.e. Little Nicky, Big Daddy and various others)I wasn't too thrilled with this one, except Kathy Bates, Blake Clark and Henry Winkler pretty much saved it from drowning (bad pun I know) in its own title.I'm kind of disappointed with this movie, but I wouldn't say not to watch it or buy it because if you love stupid comedy like I do, then you'll like this. I'm more apt to rent it rather than own it (if I didn't own it already)"
1,Utterly Dehydrated,I think the only reason why people went to see this was because that there wasn't any other movie. The movie itself was funny but the jokes that are used in this movie are often seen in other comedies.
1,"For a movie that went #1, this sure &*$%#!","This movie wasn't that funny. I laughed very little. The only parts that made me laugh were mainly the ones that involved the assistant coach talking. He talked a funny gibberish that no one could understand. The others were few, and didn't involve Adam Sandler. And about Adam Sandler, I hated him in this one! I know he was supposed to be, and excuse me if I offend anyone, mentally disabled, but the way he talked was extremely annoying! He made a stupid and unnatural voice in a pathetic attempt to be funny. He could have just talked in a normal voice and stutter just the same as he did, instead of queering it up like he did. Come on, Sandler, use some imagination! This movie's definately not #1 on my list!"
1,It relly sucks. It was a insult to my home state.,It was an insult to my girl freind Vicki. Now everybody makes fun of her becaus my name is Bobby.It was a INSULT to football and my brother who is a waterboy . Other than that it was a GREAT movie!!!!!!
1,Horrible!,"I think, this is quite possibly, the worst movie I have ever seen. I just can't imagine how anyone enjoyed this movie. I'm still shaking my head in disbelief."
1,If you have seen one Sandler movie you have seen them all.,If you have seen one Sandler movie you have seen them all.
1,"Actually, it is a no star ranking. BAD! BAD! BAD!",It is considered the worst movie I've seen. 1. low class humor. 2. insulting audience's intelligence. 3. lousy directing. 4. nothing I can think of is good.
1,Why adam why?,"This has got to be the worst adam sandler movie ever made. His accent, his mother, the whole thing, it just plain ... I'm a huge Sandler fan, but if you are looking for a laugh, watch the wedding singer or big daddy. Use this movie as a balance for a coffee table or something."
3,"Adam, what happened??","All I have to say is this movie needed so much more to it. It's funny, and well thought out, but not that well thought out! Go see Billy Madison. That has nothing to do with golf, or football, but it was certainley better than this movie! -Val K"
5,Funniest Movie,Loved it. I especially liked Adam Sandler. I think he's the funniest person alive. Adam I hope you are reading this. I loved you in this movie. I will write to you when I have the time... this week maybe. This is the funniest movie I saw since Mars Attacks.
3,The movie is okey.,The movie was good because it was played by Adam but i didn't care for it all that much because I don't have the patience to listen to someone stutter. I would tell anyone who can handle the stuttering to watch the movie.
5,Very funny Movie,"This movie explained, how Adam Sandler can be funny or serious, it was a very good Movie"
1,"Even worse than ""Billy Madison""","I've always liked Adam Sandler. Being a ""Saturday Night Live"" fan, he has provided me with some of lifes funnier moments. But unfortunately, it was ""The Waterboy"" that propelled him to superstar status. ""The Waterboy"" was a nothing of a film. When the best thing about the film is the tackling scenes, you know you've been cheated. ""The Wedding Singer"" is his best so far, in which he plays a ""real"" person with sincerity. I'll be in line to see ""Big Daddy"" as well, but I hope his character isn't as onedimensionally stupid and gimmicky as the one he played in this film."
5,I thought it was the funniest movie on earth.,I loved this movie. I thought that Adam did a great job in this movie. he made me feel so bad when they were making fun of him but he made me laugh when he messed up the professeur. . It made me happy. I liked this movie so much. In fact I am watching it now for the 20th time.
2,not his best work,"I was kinda hoping that this movie was so stupid it would be funny. Well ... there are some funny moments, but if you like Sandler see Happy Gilmore or The Wedding Singer. They are a lot less stupid and a lot more funny."
2,"SANDLER IS FUNNY, NOT IN THIS MOVIE THOUGH","Adam Sandler. Loved him in the Wedding Singer and Happy Gilmore. What the hell happened to him here? Just stupid, really, stupid, stupid comedy. Knocking people out in Football. Now that's dumb. Try the Wedding Singer with him in it. A smart choice."
5,NFL's Greatest Moments,"This has to be the funniest movie that Adam Sandler has made. I love football, and I love how underdogs get revenge on those who bully them around. Strangely enough, as I watched it, I thought it would be just another comedic film, but it had a nice simple plot with some suspense to boot. I don't care what others think about this, I say go WATERBOY!!!! Hurray for the underdogs!!!! More power to you!!!!"
4,"a smart, funny movie with a good plot!",One of Sandlers best movie so far. Not only is he at his best but he is surrounded by a great cast. Which really make the movie even better.
4,"Seen worse, seen better","I thought the Waterboy had some great moments. Adam is just being himself, a dope. Stuck in a rut like Jim Carey. Not an award winner, but can make you laugh."
4,Laughs That You Don't Grow Tired Of,"To this day, this is still my favorite Adam Sandler movie. Here we find him playing the misfit in a comedic analogue to ""Rudy"". Kathy Bates gives a great performance of the Southern Louisiana Cajun sterotype. There are many quotable lines such as, ""You can do it!"" and ""Mama says that alligators are ornery because they got all them teeth and no toothbrush."" It follows the standard formula, if you will, of most Adam Sandler movies: The plot moves along the happy path for about 2/3 of the movie. Then there is a crisis followed by resolution and a happy ending. It's not rocket science, but it works well."
2,Disappointing,"The Waterboy was greatly hyped, but, in my opinion, was greatly disappointing. I think the reason the Waterboy was such a big box office hit is that it came after the Wedding Singer which was a much better movie and many people thought they would get more of the same with the Waterboy. I can only imagine that the hard-core Adam Sandler fans would really like this movie."
5,Funny Funny Funny,"This is an oddball comedy that is very unique and funny. Kathy Bates is hilarious as his mother and it was good to see Henry Winkler doing a comedy again too. Overall a hilarious comedy, but I was a bit irritated that they gratuitously stuck an f-bomb in one scene. Im no prude, but it was out of place, didn't make the scene or movie any better and I believe was only done to make sure the movie got a more mature rating thereby causing more teens to want to see it when released in theatres. I see a lot of that movies though unfortunately. Without that one scene its actually not a bad movie to watch with your kids as long as they are teens or near teens."
2,Uh... Okay...,"This movie certaninly does not live up to the Sandler hype. I loved Wedding Singer... but to be honest... this movie just isn't funny. Yeah it has it's moments, and I really enjoyed Ron Sheinder as the ""you can do it guy"". But when it comes down to it... this movie is not worth your money. Skip it."
2,Very bad,"I'm glad, just like someone before me said, that my friend rented this. i would not want to waste $4 dollars on this. I found the only one funny scene. This is boring. Billy Madison is alot better as well as Big Daddy and The Wedding Singer"
3,Nothing great....but it's not supposed to be,"This is a good film to watch when you're in the mood for a non-think,fun,and humorous film. Adam Sandler probably gives his best performance in this film."
1,Dissapointing,"I bought this movie from all the hype that I've read. I lasted about 20 mins before I couldn't stand it anymore! I guess I'm beyond the slap-stick stage. At least the Wedding Singer had something to offer in terms of having some kind of a plot, and something believable. And yes, I love Football, but this was ridiculous!"
3,Sandlers worst film,I am a big Adam Sandler fan. I was very disappointed by the Water Boy. I rank it last out of his five major films. Kathy Bates was good. Henry Winkler was not. After watching this film I had to pull Billy Madison off the shelf and watch it to restore my faith.
3,all this movie had was slapstick,"I will admit in a second i liked the movie and will buy it the second it comes out but its not the greatest movie ever, if adam is going to do a stupid accent please do something not so annoying, I saw it twice to me this is the first ""Adam Sandler"" movie since Happy Gilmore. People please dont forget Happy Gilmore. This movie was not even as good as billy madison and thats sad. Most of you morons probably dont know adam sandler writes most of his movies and this was just ""The Excited Southerner goes to Louisana and playes football"" if you dont get that reference buy Adam Sandlers ""What the Hell Happen to me"" its a CD"
4,Highly entertaining! (kept my wife awake!),A light hearted and fun filled movie for the whole family. Adam and Henry make a great combination on the screen.
4,A hilarious movie!!! A must see!!!,"This movie is not the funniest movie Adam Sandler has done, but It is damn close!!! It is definetely worth watching. If you are in to sports or have a good sense of humor, then this is the movie for you."
4,As GREAT as ever!!!!,"I went with a bunch of idiots to this movie, and i went with a bunch of pretty smart people! and everybody liked it!!!! i am the kind of guy that notices every single thing that doesn't ad up in a movie, but in this movie I was SO just having fun! Sandler is so great in this film, as is the rest of the cast, specially the one that played the assistant coach!! well i love it!!! that's all there is to it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,It was pretty good,This movie was pretty good. I didn't see the beginning but what i saw it was pretty cool. It also makes you feel so sorry for the guy in parts but Adam Sandler did a good job acting out this movie.
3,"They just try to get too funny, so they are not...","This was a great cast (Sandler, Bates) and great characters. But they just were too dumb for us to laugh at them.Just a hint more serious, it would have been a great film!"
4,An excellent movie for not so obvious reasons.,"I'm not normally an Adam Sandler fan, but I absolutely love this movie! I am a Fairuza Balk fan, and this is the best showing of her that I have yet to see. Bates is excellent as usual, playing an oddball with professionalism. Reed and Winkler make for an interesting mix just to see how they've aged. Sandler is not his usual ""look at me"" stupid that marks most of his roles, so he is bearable even for a non-fan like myself. A bit of modesty suits him very well, even if it is to display backward antisocialism.But I must reiterate, this movie is for Fairuza Balk fans! She is incredibly beautiful, and here she's not hidden by the black garb of the occult. Something about her is irresistable. I encourage anyone to watch it for her, and not for Sandler, just to marvel at a work of art. I'm saving my fifth star for when she turns to the camera while she unzips her top :-).Adam who? This is Fairuza Balk's best movie yet!"
3,"IT'S A GOOD MOVIE, BUT JUST NOT THE BEST.","I bought this DVD because I heard it had been like big a the box-office and it was really funny and this and that. So I bought the DVD not having seen the move and I must say I was a bit disappointed, its just not as funny as I thought it would be, dont get me wrong, it is funny and it is a good comedy, but I think there was too much hype... Adam Sandler, great comedian."
1,Terrible Movie,"This movie was so bad, watching it was a waste of time, and Sandler wasnt funny at all"
2,"A ""watered-down"" version of Happy Gilmore","It seems that Adam Sandler took the funny sight gag of him tackling his caddy in Happy Gilmore and decided to make a feature film out of it. His stutter/accent in this film was distracting and probably unnecessary. Adam Sandler has great comedic talent, let's hope his next film rises to the potential shown by his previous, more hilarious films."
1,Unwatchable; Poor excuse for humor,"I'll never forgive Adam Sandler, who is often funny, for robbing me of 86 minutes of my life. I didn't laugh once. The plot was nauseating. Watch this movie ONLY if you though the Academy was remiss in their ignoring of Carrot Top for best actor for his moving performance in ""Chairman of the Board."" If you want to laugh, go rent ""There's Something About Mary."""
2,Adam Sandler: Funny the first time,"The title I used on this review is true. It also applies to Jim Carrey. The first time you see this movie, you will laugh, unless you have no sense of humour. But after that you question why you laughed, and then not laugh again. However I gave the movie two stars because Adam Sandler is funny (just not in the waterboy) and Fairuza Balk and Kathy Bates were great. But why the Fonz? I don't like Happy Days and I didn't like seeing his face again."
1,Pobre Aguatero!,"¿Se pueden seguir haciendo películas, que no tengan valor alguno para nosotros los expectadores?. Aparentemente The Waterboy es un buen ejemplo de que si. Una pelicula aburrida donde el típico ""nerd"" del colegio termina siendo el héroe de un pueblo sureño, solamente por el hecho de jugar Football. Adam Sandler no sorprende, una vez mas, en un rol sin gracia al estilo Jim Carrey en The Cable Guy. Lo rescatable es, sin ninguna duda, la madre de este jugador improvisado interpretada por la genial Kathy Bates, que maneja maravillosamente el rol de una mujer sureña excéntrica y disparatada. Consejo: Dejar que las aguas sigan su curso natural."
1,What were they thinking?,"This should not have made so much money. We were robbed. There is no plot and no comedy. Why? Idon't know. Please don't waste your money on this non-anamorphic DVD. The only extra is a trailer and a tiny ""documentary"". That's it. I never did expect more from a Disney DVD.The film is barely 90 minutes. Hardly an epic...or even a tv episode. In fact watch the worst episodes ofCharles in Charge: The Complete First Seasoninstead of watching or buying this utter nonsense. I hate Adam Sandler for this."
1,The Watergeek: for the easily amused,"Oh!, here's a shocker!, another stupidly unfunny movie made by adam Sandler!, and he's using that dorky baby voice again. The funniest thing about adam sandler is that the baby voice is actually his ""real voice"" which you hear during his off camera interviews which are few and far between because his grammer and sentence structure in real life also sounds like a fourth grader at best. I cant believe anyone could be entertained by this guy. His movies and most of his SNL material are for the extremely simple minded (i'm talking five year olds here)."
3,I like Adam Sandler but...,"Although Adam Sandler is one of my favorite comedians and I've loved every other one of his movies, I believe this one was sub-par. If you really like Adam Sandler, by all means, get it. I did, just because I like all of his movies. But if this movie is going to change your opinion of Adam Sandler try Big Daddy, the Wedding Singer, Happy Gilmore, or Billy madison. Do not get Bulletproof."
3,just for fun,"this movie is just for fun. there are no wild plots, nor amazing acting or special effects. just a few laughs along the way. which is really what the film was made for."
4,Good,It played good no defects when i played it on my DVD player. Got it in a good price i recomend it
1,The director and actors need real jobs not reel jobs.,The director and actors need real jobs not reel job
1,Irritating! Irritating! IRRITATING!!!!!,"Oh, why is it that garbage like this does so well? movies that are about as much fun as listening to recordings of clawings on a chalk board over a surround system? Toilet bowl humour of the lowest calibre, no where near the smart gross out stuff like in There's Something About Mary. And would someone please stuff a sock in Adam Sandler's throat so we don't have to listen to that supposed Cajun accent of his, which has the same ear drum destroying sound like the before mentioned clawing chalkboard. Pure garbage!--wcg"
2,"Well, what can I say","I must admit, I do like Adam Sandlers' humor, but his role as Bobbie Buche (however you spell it..) did not fit. Just this whimpering, downcast but mainly uncomfortable look about him, made for a annoying character. And that chick off the Craft, god that role suited her too well; but ended up making the movie worse. Finally, the Col. Sanders refrence made me very cynical..."
1,Why? Why did so many think this movie was funny?,"Just NOT funny. I don't know about the rest of you, but I know there are only so many times I can laugh at ""You can do it"" and ""That's what I call high quality H2O."" Why did this movie make hundreds of millions of dollars? It was very boring and I found myself asking, ""when the hell does this get funny?"" Thank God I saw this movie for free when my friend rented it, because this movie is a waste of time."
2,Sandlers Goodbye,"Hi there, if you love the waterboy movie dont read this because this is my ersonal view on it. Ok recently i watched the DVD version of this film, expecting Sandler to live upto his phenominal sucess in the box office already, boy was i wrong, not only was he not funny, but he was boring. It actually tested me to see if id sit through such a badly low budget movie. Im not going to put down low budget movies, as some are good. Come to think of it theis probably wasnt even a low budget movie, but it sure could've been. I just didnt like the style, the was no real story behind the ""funny man"". Next time Mr Sandler attemps to make a film, it would help if he had a good director, i wouldnt be suprised if this was the End of his career as it very well could be, thank-you"
5,the water boy,i rate this at 100%. this movie is is off the charts and i recommend this movie to any body. thank you
4,What is it with Sandler going nuts?,"I'm not sure if I want to subconsciously act out as Sandler's character does in the movie (in the same vein has Happy Gilmore) but Waterboy and Happy Gilmore are probably his best movies. If you like movies where the character ""snaps"" this is top notch. And hey, how can you not like seeing Fonzi?>o'"
5,"ROCK ON, WATERBOY!","Adam Sandler does it again. Continuing in the sports tradition from Happy Gilmore, Sandler plays the ""Waterboy"" who decides he wants more than that position in life. He becomes the star of the football team, goes back to school, and gains an interest in girls. Now he has to worry about Mama (Kathy Bates) who told him never to play ""foosball"" and ""little girls are the devil"". Henry Winkler turns in a funny performance as Sandler's Coach with an interesting tattoo of Roy Orbison. Adam Sandler works with a great writing team and actors who keep you laughing almost every minute. Waterboy should have been included in the SANDLER COLLECTION 3 pack DVD instead of Bulletproof, which was Sandler's only weak film. Waterboy is hilarious, which is what Sandler and his crew does best. ""HIGH QUALITY H20!!!"""
5,Adam Sandler's Best Yet!,"I saw The Waterboy 3 times with my friends!!! We loved it! I normally don't like this kind of screwball comedy, but Adam Sandler was wonderful. I can't wain until it comes to DVD on March 16. It already has a place reserved in my film collection."
5,GREAT ONE OF THE BEST!,"ADAM SANDLER GOES BACK TO THE CHILDISH COMEDY THAT MADE HAPPY GILMORE AND BILLY MADISON SO UNBELIVABLY GOOD, NO SCRACH THAT, GREAT!"
1,Not One Laugh,"I didn't laugh once. My wife kept looking over and asking, ""Are we going to watch all of this?""If you saw the preview, you saw whatever humor they managed to wrench from this...Adam Sandler is refried Jerry Lewis.But instead of maudlin attempts at sickening sweetness to win over his audiences, Sandler just beats people up."
4,Foozball is Da Debil,"This movie is totally funny..Adam Sandler is a mommas boy who is waterboy for the local football team...The team pick on him and dog him, but one day when he gets mad he shows them what he's really made of....Soon he's on the team and that has his momma mad....this is a very funny movie...Kathy Bates is Halarious in this film."
5,This was such a kick-@$$ movie!!!!,"Ohmigosh...i never thought i could like a movie that was soooo stupid, adam sandler was great!!!! i didn't stop laughing from beginning to end.....keep it up waterboy!!!!!!"
2,Over-hyped,"Disappointingly over-hyped; pleasant enough to watch but I just did not notice any of the ""hilarious"" moments so many have talked about. This comedy just isn't comedic enough."
1,1 star because it won't let me give it a 0,this was like the worst movie i have seen from 1998. as bad if not worse than disturbing behavior. it was so boring and not funny at all. i liked wedding singer but what were coraci and sandler thinking when they made this movie?
2,"So stupid, it wasnt even funny","I personally thought this was the stupidest movie ever. I'll admit, i am a big fan of Adam Sandler, but his performance in this movie sucked. There was nothin remotely humorous about this movie at all. It got soo ridiculous that i actually walked out of the theater.That bad?~ yes! Not worht it at all...."
5,EVERYTHING YOU LOOK FOR IN A COMEDY,"BEING THAT I WAS THE FIRST ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE FILM, I'M A LITTLE PREJUDICE. I GIVE IT 10 STARS!"
4,this movie is dope,the movie was the best by adam sandler he was so funny in this movie but there was only one problem he ate anaconda's and rats that was funny but it is very mean he should not have to be that poor
5,The best movie...EVER!!!!,That's what I call some high quality H2O. Adam Sandler should make a movie with the NDL!
5,Very Very Very Very Entertaining Movie!!!!!,"This movie is very funny. My friends and I had a good time watching it. It's as funny as Happy Gilmore.If you have nothing against Adam Sandler and want to laugh out loud, don't miss this movie."
1,This Movie Is Bad,"Not funny, not very entertaining. Uninspired comedy. Lines that aren't worth repeating. If one more person says ""you can do it"" I'm gonna rub my eyes and shake my head while I curse them in my mind. Do not buy this movie if you haven't seen it. Billy Madison is hilarious. Happy Gilmore, great comedy. Big Daddy--I loved it. Mr. Deeds--didn't see it, never will unless I'm stoned. 50 First Dates--Pleasantly surprised, it was hilarious. The Waterboy--ranks at the bottom of Adam Sandler's career."
1,A Disaster!,"I'm a big fan of Adam Sandler's but man, did this movie ever suck! It's garbage!......there's nothing good about it. It's Sandler's worst attempt at a comedy. And why is the Fonz in there?"
1,Punt on this one !,"Sandler is funny, real funny; however, coming from someone who played football and now plays golf. His golf skill, I can relate to - but as a football comedy, it is ridiculous. My opinion is that if you have seen the previews, you'll be disappointed in the movie. It is too redundant, Sandler's "" dumb-backwoods-boy "" impersonation is funny, but only for ten minutes. Sandler was better on the tee box than in the huddle."
1,CHEAP,The black fill was not consistant on this silverware...some did not have any black at all. Cheap workmanship.
4,Only Alphabet,"Just so you know before you buy it, this book does not teach any words, it only teaches the alphabet. It also does not go over the hebrew vowels, so is not of much use in seeing hebrew words and pronouncing them."
2,Not her best,"I've been with Paretsky since the beginning, and although the overall series is well worth reading, this is one of the weaker entries. Things finally come together in the second half, but the first half unfolds much too slowly. I'm way left of center and proud of it, but even I got tired of the liberal preaching and political stereotyping in this book. I suggest trying some of the earlier volumes in the series and hoping Paretsky gives us more plot, more believable characters and less save-the-world politicking on V.I.'s next outing."
1,P. 260 and bored stiff,"A few caveats. I'm very liberal, and I've read most of the Warshawski series.But this book is trying even my patience. Last night I thought, I can't possibly be on p. 260 and not yet have a plot other than rich people are bad, and poor people are only hard-working and noble. It can't be.And it can't be that the plot so far is that the idealistic teenage heir (Romeo) of the rich bad guys--who own a not-so-veiled Wal-Mart-like retail giant--has fallen for the poor Latina (Juliet). Sadly, though I'm supposed to, I don't care for Romeo or Juliet.Nor do I care for any other character at this point, even Vic, who's doing all the same stuff she normally does (pissing off rich people, having Lotty tend to her wounds and then dining with her, taking the dogs out, arguing with Mr. Contreras) but to no end and exceptionally boringly. I've read this stuff before, many times. Get to something interesting!This is really painful to read."
1,Extremely weak and flawed story,"Please tell me there are not detectives like VI out on the street. WOW! Is she bad. There were four significant times in the story that she pocketed what would have been important evidence which she doesn't give over to the police, the DA or anyone. Tell me, if you find a cell phone of a missing person in the pocket of a dead man, are you going to give it away to a teenager - without even checking to see what calls had been placed? And you are in possession of extremely incriminating evidence against someone going on trial and you are going to keep it in your safe deposit box?The soap dish. Please don't get me started on the soap dish. It was so stupid.I think the thing that got me most of all was the wordiness... the long rambling stream of consciousness gibberish that made me want to plunge a red hot poker through my eye. It was the worst book I read in a long time. I can't believe I ever finished it."
2,Hardpressed to read another Warshawski book,"I have read all of Paretsky's books with Warshawski as the heroine (ha!)and used to look forward to the next. With the last few, I have just plodded through and skipped pages trying to find the ""good stuff"" that would keep me interested without predictability. Sadly, ""Fire Sale"" never grabbed my attention. I kept going back to it while reading other books, hoping to find something of the Warshawski that I used to like, but all of it just seemed redundant. Recycled characters, plot, etc... but not in a good way. Perhaps it's time for Paretsky to invent a new line of novels so we can enjoy her again."
3,a question,I wish someone would just tell me how much a CDC-Z127 Aiwa cd player cost brand new because i have one got it today from someone else and i was wandering if it is as much as they say it cost. I have been told by diferent people that it isnt a very good one and i wish someone could tell me different. PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you.
2,Not great for the stage,"I wasn't impressed with this tape for stage use. The claim that the tape is charged within 30 minutes of exposure to natural or artificial light is incorrect. In my experience, bright stage lights shining on the tape for over an hour isn't enough to charge it to the point where I am comfortable with the actors making exits during a blackout."
3,Meh...,"It glows brightly after being ""charged"" with light, but the glow only lasts a few minutes. Disappointing... I was hoping the tape would glow at least for a few hours. After about 15 minutes of darkness, it ceases to glow."
2,Low Glow,"I wanted this tape to use for nighttime security purposes: I put 3-4"" strips on light switch plates and just above door handles to theoretically help us see critical spots during a potential emergency in a power outage. Most don't seem to glow at all, and those that do are so faint they would not be helpful much at all in a true emergency. Guess I'll have to try something else!"
3,"It is a good product, just not for what I needed it for.",I needed this product for my children to run in the park. They do track practice at the park and it gets dark. I wanted this tape to put on their t-shirts but the tape did not really stick. it wasn't as bright as I needed it to be. I opted on another solution that was safer.
2,Didn't Last,Product arrived promptly & was well-packaged. It is easy to apply. My issue is that within 30 minutes after dark it had stopped glowing. It was applied in an outdoor area that receives constant sun.
3,"thin, fluorescent, not that sticky","This thin tape is very fluorescent, but it's not very sticky or flexible. After an hour or so of exposure to dim indoor lighting it still glows in the morning. But it won't stick for more than a few hours to something like at pocket knife's nylon sheath, nor is it flexible enough to wrap around it properly. Worth having, but you should be aware of it's limitations."
3,not impressed with build quality,i used the tape on the stairs trim. adhesive seems ok. the build quality is poor. i found bubbling between the clear plastic and the adhesive backing on several locations. i was not able to correct this defect but it does not seem noticeable from several feet away. also i had a tough time cutting the clear plastic with a sharp razor. i found it best to lay the razor on the tape and press firmly while pulling away the extra tape. the luminescent feature itself is decent. it loses majority of its lite in a few minutes. also it seems sensitive to shadows so it tends to give off uneven briteness in different spots.
2,Eh...,This tape really didn't live up to my expectations. It kept coming off the floor ultimately resulting in several near-miss accidents. I spent a lot of time sticking it back down with gaff tape on the edges which became a daily annoyance.
2,It glows for about ten minutes,"I'm thinking some people luck out and some don't when it comes to this product. We got this to mark doorways inside so we could cut down on our electricity use at night. It will glow very faintly at first... then fizzles out to nothing. Maybe it just doesn't play well with CFL bulbs, or maybe some of us just got a bad batch. It's a coin toss, so good luck!"
4,Cool tape that really does glow in the dark,"This is so handy for a number of emergency or low-light situations. Of course, it won't glow all night long but it is still very good."
4,Not a Bad Book If Your Just Getting Started,"Pretty much all the basics are covered in this book, as with any survival book it is generalized for all deserts. It's not written with much negative opinion, example... in the fire starting section not much credit is given to the StrikeForce (which is an awesome tool to always have on your person) and no mention of how crappy the BlastMatch which sucks hard and is almost impossible to use to light tinder. ??? What ever i guess maybe he's never tryed eather one. Alot of talking about rubbing sticks together to get fire which i didnt care for. Dry book in general, library had this book and i checked it out.Buy it if your just getting started i guess, read it for free if your already tooled up and have been into survival for some time."
1,Never thought I'd meet a chai tea I didn't like!,"I can't believe how much I dislike this tea. I don't understand it. I love gingerbread, rum, chai tea, and all the other ingredients listed. And the packaging is so beautiful. But just the smell of this tea is enough to turn my stomach. I drank three cups, trying to ""acquire"" a taste for it, since I now have six boxes of the stuff (minimum order)! But it just didn't happen. My husband thought I was exaggerating, so I made a cup for him. Same reaction. I even tried not inhaling in order to bypass the smell before tasting it. It's just awful!!! I'm going to take a box of it to the local library ... first one to say they like it gets the other five boxes!!! Hope I don't get banned from the library!"
3,Okay.,"The quality of the tea was good, but the flavor was possibly a bit too much. I love clove and other powerful flavors, but this required a lot of honey to balance."
3,Disappointed,"I love Stash Chai tea, so when I saw this one I was excited by the description but the reality was a disappointment. I also bought the Chocolate Hazelnut tea which was also a disappointment, and it also contains peanuts, so persons with peanut allergies have to be careful. The Chai, and Double spice Chai are really the best."
1,This is Old Tea - and False Advertising,"The picture shows this year's tea (the box was redesigned in late 2011) - but the tea I received is in the old packaging. The date on the bottom of the box is 7/14, so it's not expired...but it's over a year old. The date on the holiday chai currently in stores is 10/15. This is false advertising and purposely misleading. I'll be returning it and contacting Amazon. What a waste of time and money! Selling old food at current prices is pretty low."
2,Overwhelming fake rum flavor,I love Stash Chai and I drink about 6 cups of it every day. I tried this holiday chai because I thought it might have a nice kick to it. No! It doesn't taste like Chai at all. It has an overpowering chemical fake rum flavor. Ick. Unfortunately I bought the pack of 6 boxes! Stay away!!
4,Excellent Router,"I recently purchased this Makita router after a Porter Cable router broke. This is my first Makita tool and I am very pleased with the quality. Everything feels like it is made very well and made to last. I do not feel that the router is ""quiet"" as some other reviewers mentioned. It is still very loud just like every other router I have used. The only negative aspect of the router is the need for 2 wrenches to change a bit. This is quite difficult and makes you feel stupid, like you have two left hands. I thought the Porter Cable one wrench design is better in this regard but the Makita feels like a higher quality tool. Hopefully the engineers can improve this in future models."
4,Good router kit for the money,"Got this Makita router kit about a year ago at a really good price. Good power, well made. I have used the plunge base but not the fixed base since I have another fixed based router that fills that need. Plunge mechanism works well, motor assembly adjusts easily in the base. Machine is pretty stable. Probably better routers out there, but you cant go wrong with this one."
1,Weak!,"I thought the female character in this book was extremely weak. She did nothing when her ex threatened to take their son away, just stood by and waited.She allowed others to put her down, and at the end she came blubbering to the guy begging for him to take her back. She has no spine, and it made the story weak."
4,Couldn't get batteries to work. Otherwise great!,"I couldn't get it to work with brand new Maxell batteries, so I ordered a replacement keyboard, only to find that it too didn't run on batteries (the instruction manual clearly states that it should be able to). I found an AC power adapter to use and it works great. I have yet to try some higher powered batteries, but will happily keep using it with the power cord regardless.Other than the initial battery issues, this keyboard works great for the price I paid! ($30)"
1,FALSE ADVERTISING ON AMAZON,"The specs on this product clearly state that it has key touch sensitivity. This was the main thing that prompted me to order it as a present for my nephew. Well, it doesn't! And I don't feel like going through the hassle of having to tell him he has to send it back and I'll get him something else for his birthday.Amazon should just give me a credit for future purchases in the amount of this misrepresented product.Very disapointed with Amazon."
3,What's the deal with the price change?,How come this item was $29.95 just 15 hours ago and is now $49.95? Inflation?
2,Misrepresented product,I was dissappointed to see that when I got the product there were old worn out batteries inside and I then had to go out and purchase an adapter and spend MORE money. The keyboard works fine now but that was unacceptable for me to have had to do that. I was very surprised by this from Amazon since I have had such good experiences so far.
1,Not as described,"The product does not have the ""touch sensitive key"" function as it states in the technical specBeware!"
3,Pretty good with reservations,"Bought a refurbished model (full factory guarantee). Disappointed with its vaunted Concert Grand Piano voice...seems piercing and plinky to me. Much prefer the Electronic Piano 1 voice which is mellow.If you crank the volume too high, you can overdrive the speakers and get a buzzing. Works fine in feeding midi into the computer, but beware the cost of the connector cable. Yamaha's UX-16 is half again the price of the keyboard."
2,Not what I expected,"Very few of the recipes inspire me to want to make them. The only ones I am even tempted to try are the couple of oat recipes. There are a lot more rice recipes than any of the other grains. The book is very uninspiring. There are no photos either which might have helped. I must add that I am not a vegetarian but was looking for ways to prepare grains and get more of them in my daily cooking. But OAT GROAT SOUP WITH MUSTARD AND THYME, just doesn't sound very appealing to me, for example.She lists buckwheat, millet, oats, quinoa, rice, amaranth, job's tears, teff as the grain categories. No wheat or corn."
4,Great value,"Bought this trumpet for my son several years back at Sam Ash. Apparently Jean Baptiste is sort of a Sam Ash ""house brand""; the word on the web is that this model is actually made by the well-known German company B+S (I never verified this for sure but I did do a side-by-side comparison between this horn and a photo of the equivalent B+S model, and they seemed to be identical in every detail). Before buying it I found some reviews at [...] (do a Google search for TP-900S, the link to the review will come right up). The reviewers compare it with the Bach Strad (of course, everything gets compared to the Strad); the consensus seems to be that it doesn't quite measure up to a Strad but is a great deal for the money. The horn is very well made, we never had any trouble with the slides or valves, and it looks and plays great."
5,Fantastically clear and engaging,"Potolsky's book is an *exceedingly* clear and engaging introduction to mimesis. If you want to understand the relevance of Plato's theory of mimesis for (say) Baudrillard and Deleuze (as well as mimesis in Aristotle, Girard, Freud, and Lacan, etc.) then this is the book for you. Highly recommended."
5,If you love beer this is an excellent book to have.,"This book is dedicated to American beers only. The recent craftbrewing explosion has given the author plenty to write about. His reviews are very descriptive and give a lot of information as to the ingredients in the beer and the style of beer being reviewed. This is very valuable information for the serious beer lover and even to the serious brewer. The beers being reviewed are easily accessible to the reader thus he or she can seek out the beers being reviewed, taste them, and critically evaluate them. The author has given very good info so the reader can learn about ingredients of a beer and their potential contributions to beer flavor. The only knock on this book is that it only reviews 375 beers which is only a small percentage of what is available in U.S. today. However, the thoroughness of the reviews and the amount of information given make this book one of the most important books on beer to own."
4,for X-fans only,"i didn't check the science of the book to see how accurate it was or was not. i don't think that is really the purpose of the book. it's here for fans of the x-men to think on what gives them their powers. and it is mildly entertaining in its attempt. the writing bogs down here and there and gets a little boring but overall it is entertaining. there are a few xmen that are left out that would have been nice to read about (gambit, bishop, cannonball, toad, avalanche, mystique) and there are some that are questionable in their inclusion (scarlet witch, unus the untouchable). the technology and alien races section are extremely weak. the technology offers no diagrams and both sections are merely synopsises and don't go into the how. still, for an x-fan, it is worth reading."
2,waste of time,"The science is not that great, and the X-men part of it isn't that great, either. The science part was much more physics oriented than biologically oriented, which was a disappointment for me because I was more interested in how those characteristics could evolve rather than how they would play out in the physical world. I still think it's an interesting concept and it would be very cool if someone did it right."
2,Not the best.,"I had anticipated more from this book. Quite a few important characters are left out, and also quite a bit of the X-Men information is wrong. Seems like they did plenty of science research, but hardly any X-Men research."
2,Wait for a second edition,"The editing in this book is abysmal, from verbatim repititions to errors like ""here motions"" instead of ""her emotions"". While errors like this seem minor, they make this book a frustrating read. Several sections are very unfocused: rather than attempting to explain a mutant's powers, those sections describe various tangentially-related scientific phenomena. While this may interest some readers, I would prefer better focus on viable explanations for the powers. Overall, the idea behind this book has a lot of potential, but the reality is disappointing."
2,Wait for a second edition,"The editing in this book is abysmal, from verbatim repetitions to errors like ""here motions"" instead of ""her emotions"" (Storm section). While this doesn't affect the content, it makes this book a frustrating read.Several of the character sections are rather unfocused and follow tangents of tangents. Some sections discuss scientific phenomenon that have nothing to do with the mutants' powers, but are merely related topics. While some readers may be interested in these facts, I personally wanted more focus on the mutant powers themselves."
3,"Needs and editor, yet slightly interesting","This book is in dier need of an editor, it has bad grammer and often repeats sentences and sometimes even Paragraphs. Occasionally this book even is hard to read. Although this book is not completely useless. This book is slightly interesting, it has nice notions and can at some times be very scientific ( hense the name) which may lead to some excitment to make you keep reading. If your an X-men Fan, this book will go good with your collection and may spark some intrest, disregarding the frequent errors."
5,making it,poop should have been included in this book which has some very interesting insight into the world of the x-men all together a very well thought out and researched bookPOOP POOP POOP POOOP POOOOOOOOOP POOOOOOOOOP
2,X-Tremely Poor,"The concept of this book is excellent and the introduction is good. This completes the list of nice things I have to say about the book. The artwork varies from good to dismal, the science is often poor or simply wrong (a list of my favorites: Stephen Jay Gould is a controversial evolutionist!, most scientists believe evolution of higher life forms from nothing is inevitable(?), superstring theory is presented as a fact, only primitive civilizations have polytheistic religions(I'd love to know where he got this one from and how the Hindus of the world feel about it), and the section on the Brood shows such a fundamental lack of understanding of evolutionary theory that I was almost in tears). I might even have overlooked these glaring problems if the writing about the characters had been good, but quite frankly, it wasn't. The author mentions the possibility of sequels in the introduction; in response I say: Please don't."
2,From a Scientist's P.O.V..... uncredible,"Personally speaking as a long-time X-men fan, I find this book an interesting piece of fiction...but not as interesting as the fiction which motivates it. The Physics of Star Trek succeeds where this book fails simply because it is written by a scientist who can see the mistakes in the logic of Star Trek yet is able to admire the prescience and veracity of its many writers. X-men is mostly based on a biological phenomenon, yet this book is quick to point out how all of their powers are so mysteriously derived. And when the authors are stumped, they owe the powers to mini-wormholes within the characters' bodies. This book is interesting to fans because it features characters they know and love, but it is a horrendous atrocity to anyone who would like to ponder the origin of mutant powers. These authors have nothing on Stan Lee and his cosmic rays, gamma rays and radioactive spiders. I can bear the typos, but the complete lack of parsimony is appalling."
4,Most Interesting!,"I like the author's approach -- that the most simple scientific explanations are the best and not to complicate the explanations of the X-Men's powers. Also, this book is a reminder that a lot of contemporary scientific thought is even stranger than the strangest fiction, the implications of which are not yet fully understood and COULD plausibly explain mutant powers. Sure, there are typos in this book, but don't let that stop you. This book is fun. And educational!"
2,Not for those with lacking scientific knowledge...,"I am the first person to admit that my science knowledge is limited. It ends on a college freshman physical science level. I thought that this book could give me a better grip on science by using a topic I enjoy to explain it. Well, the science is poorly explained for those of us who are science dummies. I tried to keep up but just couldn't. And on top of that the text is dry. The most interesting part of the book are the introductions for each character. I will not lie to you, halfway through the book I started to read only the introductions and skipped the rest. I am glad that I borrowed it from a friend. Don;t waste your money, and if you just REALLY REALLY need to read it because you are an X-Men fan then check your local library."
2,Was fine until half of it fell off in the woods.,"The lower extension cinch bolt worked loose while riding, and the lower extension fell out and is lost forever.The extension ought to have had a stop to prevent it from sliding all the way out of the upper tube. Having to keep a kickstand tightened to prevent half of it falling else is absurd- I'd rather it just came long and they had me hacksaw it to length."
1,Worthless junk,Worthless rickety piece of junk. Presently looking for one of those sturdy one piece models seen on most kids bikes.
1,I received three DOAs in a row,"Tech4Less sent me three DOA memory chips, one right after the other, over a two week period. Total waste of time. Then for the icing on the cake, I got a $5.00 refund (out of roughly $17.00 that I spent). It's obvious they don't test their memory chips before selling them. I should have spent the $50 for a new one in the first place."
1,Wont work,I bought two memory modules to upgrade my compaq presario 1700t to 512 and it wont work. Anyone with an idea or help please email me at bhartenbach@msn.comThanks
3,good shape,the book it self was in excellent shape but it was not the book picture and there was a lot more writing in it than i excepted. i would still order from this site.
3,Pretty good,"This is a single from the ""Lowdown Motivator"" album. It is not my favorite song on the CD. A few mixes on the single are pretty good. Worthwhile for the collector."
5,amazing purchase,"I got it right on time. The movie is amazing with an outstanding cast. The combination of Mauricio Garces, Silvia Pinal, Angelica Maria, Enrique Rambal and Elsa Aguirre its just out of this world!!"
3,not real happy,"It is not very fragrant and does not stay on long. I do love their healing garden body spray,it's very nice"
5,Both odd and curious!,This book holds a range of fun and unusual plants to try to grow. The authors are very specific on care of these houseplants and the writing style is witty.
5,Awesome,This is by far the most I have enjoyed Baldwin is a long time. Again not disappointed with the truth about the images that were real in his writings for a time past.
4,Nice but not quite big enough for my lefse rolling pin,I bought these mainly to cover my lefse rolling pin. They are a bit small for it but I was able to make do.
4,Good for smaller rolling pins,"I ordered these with a 15"" by 2 3/4"" dia. rolling pin. They are about 1/2"" short of covering the entire rolling surface. I use the covers primarily to protect the surface but for someone that actually uses them for rolling dough this could be a problem. Granted, mine is a very large rolling pin, standard would be 10"" or 12"" and these would work just fine."
1,Product Not As Advertised,The rolling pin cover description clearly states that they are made in the USA. They are not; they are made in China. I wanted to purchase a product that was made in America and specifically not in China. This seller was not truthful about the origin of their product.
2,thin but workable,"I am looking for rolling pin covers with more heft, like the holey one I've had for many years. These were thin. Really, who needs two?That being said, it was easy to cut down to size for my rolling pin. They picked up the flour easily, so no sticking without leaving to much flour on the dough.So they work, but I was hoping for something with more body in the fabric."
2,Having a hard time finishing this book,I read the reviews for this book and brought it thingink it woulfd be a page turner. WRONG! This book drags on and on and on. Too many characherts and the story lines jumps around. Did everyone read the same book I did?
4,How much pain can an she endure?,"Fascinating multi-generational story of lies, lust and secrets. The villain's tentacles spread through everyone's lives, yet on the surface he seems to be a respectable man. Portia, the protagonist, is the villain's daughter and the most affected. Her story is tragic and everything she does is acting out her pain. I am unsure whether her story is really resolved or not. I guess it is ""to be continued.""The sex was frequent and quite steamy, and the sights, sounds, smells and visceral were uniquely descriptive. The author has a nice way with words. The only thing that distracted me was the head-hopping where the point of view would suddenly change from paragraph to paragraph.The storylines are deeply rooted, colliding and crashing at the end. More secrets remain hidden, and who knows how much more pain Portia can endure before all of it is over.Secrets was a fast read/page turner and I finished it in a couple of hours."
2,Secret's Portia's Story,This book was one of my book club selections. I thought the book had too many unnecessary characters and jumped around so much that you could no get a chronological sense of what was going on. The plot idea was good but the author failed to deliver
5,A grand story,"A fantastic read, with characters that we all can identify with and a story that we have or will experience in our lifetimes. Set in the north woods of Minnesota with the outdoor lifestyle of hunting, especially duck hunting, as the string that ties the story together it is not a hunting story. But it is a must read for all true duck hunters.It is a story about love, friendship, loss, and redemption. It is a story about how life can be smooth and ordered only to become rough and complex. A great book for the winter."
2,I expected better,"I read the author's ""Mulligan"" before this. Mulligan wasn't bad. Story about a professional in a distant marriage who just chucks it all and takes off out west with his dog for a new, but unplanned, life. If you like ranching and fly fishing, Mulligan will appeal to you also.""...Horses"" was less than mediocre, and, as someone else said, too long. I really only got through half of it, but I could see it wasn't going to change, and moved on to another read. It began to turn into a romance novel with some hunting trips thrown in. Also, the relationship of the main character with his father and best buddy was way over the top for me."
3,Horses,I have no way of reviewing this yet as I haven't had a chance to read it.So guess I have to put in enough words to be able to submit and that's all.
5,Inspiration,"WAITING FOR WHITE HORSES inspired me to begin writing a monthly column for ADVENTURE SPORTS OUTDOORS. For years my friends have been urging me to write about my long-time love for vacations enjoyed on Nokay Lake near Brainerd, Minnesota. After reading this wonderful book, my first words were, ""I;m ready to write."" Nathan Jorgenson made me recall countless times spent with friends and family either in a fishing boat or a duck blind. I was flooded with memories so clear and personal that I had to begin sharing them. I have been writing ""Minnesota Memoirs"" for nearly five years now, and I never would have begun without ...HORSES. By the way, I have seen the ""white horses,"" and I believe that many of like experiences have too. Wonderful book! Anyone who shares a kinship with the wonders of hunting and fishing will find it to become an instant favorite!"
4,A Valuable Florida Botanical Reference,"Mr. Craighead's work is dated, and the paperback edition has not stood the test of time. My pages are nearly falling out of the broken binding. On the other hand, Florida currently has very poor botanical references in book form despite having an enormous amount of plants - a grave handicap for anyone trying to learn the flora. It is authoritative and fills in an important but narrow information gap. If the price is right, grab it."
5,A more useful reference book than you'd imagine...,"Wow! I was really surprised with the quality of this book - It is a very well organized book of rhyming words, which is a handy thing to have around! The rhyming words are listed alphabetically by number of syllables. I bought 3 of these for friends of mine who are going into University journalism courses, and they were thrilled. These things aren't just for ""ages eight and up"" as it states on the back; everyone can have fun with a rhyming dictionary!It's also really fun to just read the rhyming words out loud quickly in front of a group of people. It's an excellent ""coffee-table book"" in that sense! More fun than a barrel of monkeys!"
2,this is too basic,"all they do is take every suffix and play the alphabet game, just running down the list, there are no complex rhymes half of common words are left out."
2,motorola from freehasslecell.com,"order took 2 weeks because the package came back to them from the post office damaged. at least they upgraded it to a slightly better phone for it, but it still shouldnt have happened in the first place"
2,Not for me,"What was I thinking? This is definitely a case of ""it's better to stick with name brands"". The texture was fine but after that the similarities end. I don't know if it's because this was a ""healthy"" version or if this company just makes a very different product, but they taste awful. Nobody I've offered them to likes them. Unfortunately, I'm stuck with several bags thanks to this bulk purchase. Unless you've had this product before and liked it, I don't recommend it."
4,Great for Double Espressos,"Perfect size for a double espresso and allows you to see the great brew you make. Two minor criticisms: 1) it feels a little light and frail. I prefer something with a little weight to it so if you are expecting something with a little substance to it, this is not it. 2) I would prefer something a little more squat with the same volume. If you use it with say the Gaggia Classic, it is too tall to put on the tray and have it go under the dispenser. You have to remove the tray and hold it under, and squat to watch it fill. So with machines that are taller, this may be no big deal, but for squatter models it is a problem. I use these cups anyway and they deserve 4 stars despite these shortcomings."
3,"Great cup, but doesnt fit deLonghi Expresso maker correctly",They look elegant. They keep expresso hot a long time.They don't fit under my Delonghi correctly. Unable to remove filter and put in another pod without first removing the cup!!!
2,"Alright, but there are better ones","We bought a few of these as an alternative to the much more expensive glasses of the same style from Bodum. However, these were no match, and we returned them to get the ones from Bodum. They cost a lot more but are much nicer in every way. The handle on these is square and not as comfortable to hold. The capacity is too low, slightly less than the rated four ounces."
1,Don't bother,"THESE ARE NOT DISHWASHER SAFE. Just after 2 or 3 washes, they had water on the inside of them, and they cracked. 2 of them broke just as I set them on the counter. They are very cheap."
5,their 4th studio cof all original material,"Reviewer: Robert (Wales)The NRP are a tight-knit trio that generate high calibre material. Nobby's evocative vocals are delightful, this coupled with his guitar virtuosity combine to provide a feast of soulful,relaxing music. Moonlight Drivin' is another quality CD that showcases Nobby's considerable talent. How the NRP have not received greater recognition globally is a mystery to me."
5,excellent adv undergrad text on numerical linear algebra,"Great for classroom and self study.One of the few texts to give step by step exampleson almost all of its algorithms,which can be carried outon most hand held calculators. An essential step inthe learning process. This book makes learning NumericalLinear Algebra as exciting as it really is."
1,Flimsy,"Muffin cups were dented in shipping... they are so lightweight that they would get damaged even if you are very careful. The only positive, is that it is perfectly sized for a toaster oven.I returned mine :-("
1,don't buy this book!!!!!!,"unless you enjoy editing a book you PAID for, get something else! I'm sitting here 1 week before my test completeing the questions section and finding errors in about 1 in 4 to 5 questions. The answers are wrong based on 1. common medical knowledge 2. direct contradiction to info in the book. 3. direct contradiction to current pain text books 4. sometimes, answers aren't even given (a through d are possible choicesa and e is listed as the answer ina 'choose one format').As a veteran of US medical examination process including all USMLE exams and anesthesia written and orla boards, I can tell you this is the worst reveiw book I've ever encountered. There are also typo's throughout the text- sentence fragments, etc. Get something else to help you prepare for this board. Dr. Raj obviously doesn't care about his reputation or he wouldn't put his name on such a piece of junk!"
1,Stick with the older edition,"The quality of the text has remarkably gone down from the original first edition. It appears that non-medical staff have summarized the Big Raj Pain Text into this small useless book. There is no conceptulization for the novice and no review aspect for people preparing for pain boards. I would strongly recommend to stick with the older ""orange"" edition or consider ""Hand Book of Pain Management"" by Wall and Melzack."
1,Pain,The book is to simple. does not offer specifics in areas like MRI sections or EMG. Is not a good review for the people studing for the boards
4,Creates a lot of questions about Thorne,"I enjoyed this breezy and interesting book. It is not heavy on forensics (that is a good thing, in my opinion) but it is based on characters and feelings. Billingham writes about female characters particularly well and every so often will write a paragraph or page that is so striking and thought-provoking that it makes the price of the book.The part of the book that I am so-so about is the actions of the lead character Tom Thorne. Without giving any spoilers, he makes a couple of decisions in the book that are questionable morally and professionally, I am not sure if the author needed to go down this path.As with all of Mark Billingham's books, very readable."
1,Have to say this one is not worth the effort,"I should have given up on this early on but I finished it and now I feel completely robbed of time that could have gone elsewhere.The only upside is I listened to this in the car commuting.This story is lame, uneventful, tedious and boring. It never gets off the ground or catches the imagination.Tom Thorne is a dull character.Ian Rankin does it much better with Rebus."
4,Roseann the Librarian & Penguin lover,"In addition to Muppets, I collect Penguins....this is adorable, and I snap it onto my silver chain or bracelet for a little fun when I wear black/white outfits. Picture is exactly what you get. My enameling was perfect, clasp was well-made. No problems...pure fun."
5,A book that will stay with you,"For about 3 months I had not read a book because I just did not have any motivation to read. I found this book, read the first page and knew that I would read this from finish to start unlike the other books that I bought and got sick of. I could not put down this book and it is very sad but the ending gave me a touching feeling. Some parts were quite disturbing. This book has made me aware of the kids on the street. I hope more people will read this so they too will be aware."
5,theories of relativity,"In the Book Theories of Relativity it shows how the people who go threw life with out a theory are the ones who never ask questions. The main character Dylan was cut lose by his mother. When Dylan must fend for himself he if forced to set goals. Family was also somthing Dylan had to think about. When you have no one to look after you. You make the decisions. This book was a very good book to read. It is one that will open your eyes to look around and see what is really going on. I think from now on the homeless aren't just people who chose to live on the streets. They are the ones that create the theroys. The ones who ask all the questions. And with out questions, There are no answers"
2,Couldn't stay awake.,"This book had absolutely not plot. Day after day the same old things happened to him. I thought that this book would be interesting, especially for $17, but alas it was not. This book is supposed to be for the young adults, well im almost 16 and it bored me to death. Don't buy it, its not worth your money!"
1,Not a good catch at all...,"You would think that at this price this product would be a good buy. Be it for a kid, or for yourself ... it's not. This discman worked a total of a day and a half. I bought it to tide me over til I could get a more advance player. Bad mistake on my part, seeing that I should know better. When buying any kind of electronic product, cheater is NOT better. Trust me, save up the money you need to purchase yourself a quality SONY discman. In over ten years I've only owned two discmans ... and they were both SONYs. Now I'm going to purchase another SONY, forget the rest."
1,Buyer Beware,"This video was recorded in PAL, not NTSC and is NOT compatible with US playback equipment. Buy ONLY if you have PAL playback capability (European).-dtm-"
3,Read if you have nothing much better to do,"Updike's prose is truly beautiful. I'm not going to begrudge him that. But he's a bit of a misogynist and he doesn't really say much. Not with THE CENTAUR at least. If you want to see two mildly interesting characters portrayed in a fairly reasonable and realistic light, go ahead. The book isn't awful. It's actually quite engaging really. It just feels a bit like a literary rice cake. There doesn't seem to be too much there."
4,translation please?,"I'm a hopeless monoglot and can't read ancient Greek. So does anyone know what that sentence on the last page says? That ""final word"" that Chiron's will, a perfect diamond under the pressure of absolute fear, utters? Just curious. Either way, it was a good book."
4,The Centaur,It was a good purchase for the money paid.Better quality books generally cost much more:-)
5,Great book,This wonderful book explores the awkward transitional state of adolescence and the paranoia and disillusionment of middle age with the masterful metaphors that make Updike so much fun to read.
1,Keep mythology for the Greeks,"I listened to this book as a Book on Tape. Although it was well read, it was very difficult to follow as the narration jumped from past to present (to what from some perspectives is the future) and from the father's view to the son's. Add to that bites of greek mythology, that did not tie very well to the main body of the novel.I also grew weary of Updike's far reaching literary blather, such as the twigs on on the snow were calligraphical, and using the word ""ambrosial"" numerous times.I felt the book was weakend by the forced interweaving of a Greek myth that most modern day readers aren't familar with. Too cute for words!I only kept reading to see how the father sacrifices himself for his son. It did say he died at 50, but never gives any of the details. Infuriating!"
4,Nut Harvester,"I use the device to harvest acorns. I made a better handle using three 6"" pieces of 1"" PVC and a 1"" tee and filled the handle with mortar. Works well."
4,Roller Nut Harvester,The Roller Nut Harvester works fine but is a little heavy compared to nut harvesters I used in the past.
2,Smaller pecans fall out,The wires are too loose and only large pecan will stay in. If wires were tighter I think it would work better.
1,Not as expected.,This nut harvester lasted exactly 2 weeks and then it broke. The handle was deteriorating when it arrived and the basket lost it's clip so it stopped working. Would not recommend this version.
2,not so happy,"its designed to roll and pick up pecans, but as it rolls it drops the pecans you already picked up, I would change the name from roller to pecan dabber works a little better that way...."
2,well...good idea,springs lost it shape after one use.. sent it back.. no problem.. i like the design.. if you purchase this... be VERY carefull when you empty the nuts out... springs WILL LOSE THEIR SHAPE!
3,slow process,"This thing works okay if you don't have as many acorns as we do to pick up. You have to go back and forth over the same area over and over in order to pick up a few nuts, empty them, then go again. We found a rake and shovel work a lot better for the many trees we have and trying to get them up fast so our horses wouldn't eat them. Also, I found the same item at half the price after I ordered and used them so I couldn't send them back (we ordered 2).They work---just very slowly."
2,Seems great but very poorly made,"Bought this on Amazon, as we have enormous quantities of acorns and hickory nuts in our yard.When it arrived, the wheel wouldn't turn. One of the cotter pins had been pushed too far in and so it interfered with the cage. I had to manually bend it open to fix this.Actual use was pretty simple and it DOES pick-up nuts. My daughter loved using it. But after just two or three uses, when I spread the wires apart to empty the nuts out, they stayed open. This makes the tool useless, and I couldn't fix it. I ended up returning it.The construction is very cheap. The central wheel is a rough cylinder of wood, and a single coil of wire is wrapped around it, held in place by a cheap metal pipe clamp. The whole thing was painted green, seemingly with cheap spray-paint. Even if it had not broken so quickly, I doubt it would have lasted long and it certainly isn't worth more than $5 in terms of materials and construction"
5,great pecan picker upper,"This was a great purchase, it works great and saves the old back it is theneatest pecan picker upper I've seen or ever used. It is built well and again works great."
2,"Kinda works, but....","I bought the Roller Nut Harvester to pick up acorns from a number of oak trees in my yard. Every year squirrels bury the acorns and annihilate my lawn. The harvester works in the sense that it picks up a ton of acorns. However, it also pulls up all the grass along the way. So, if you don't care about things around the acorns (like grass), then this product is probably for you. If you're like me and you want to save your lawn from acorns, then this is definitely NOT a solution. Raking the acorns is more effective."
1,Pecan picker,"After receiving this item and using it, I found it not to be the quality that I expected nor would I recomend as an item to purchase."
5,Pwning awesome gun,"This gun rocks, it is my third high-end AEG (after a Marui MP5J)I have many accessories for it (M203, light, AN/PEQ, etc), and some people would say to get a sling.. I personally think that it is not all that heavy... i used to lug it around with my M203 and a C-Mag.. you get used to it. The RIS is one of the best parts... great for the many attachments that you can get for an M4 style gun. The full stock is also good, you need the full stock for the large type battery. Another good thing for it is that it comes with a 300 round Hi-cap mag. One bad thing is that you cant use ICS 450 round mags... mine doesnt feed.Over-all: Great Gun!!-Spartan"
3,"It was well done, but much shorter than I expected.","Dialect and settings were authentic, but I would have liked to have heard and seen much more. Burns country has so much more to offer visually. There is no substitute for hearing Burns works read in authentic dialect. For viewers not familiar with the dialect, a score or subtitles would have been very helpful.I was extremely pleased with another purchase, the multi-volume set of recordings of Burns' songs. They were complete and included scores."
5,"Useful, really so","This book, found by chance the first time by me in 1978 in a San Francisco bookstore, was useful for my change of career in 1980, and I bought it again and again for my son and now his wife who in 2003 does not know what to do - so she has so many tallents. The book helps you recognise, what you like, what you are good at, how you would like to spend so many hours left of your life. And then, gives you courage to go for it."
5,"The Best ""Affirmation Format"" book I have used.","This order represented my 2nd copy of this book. My first was purchased approximately 15 years ago--I wore it out. As an ACOA, I have owned and routinely used several day-to-day, affirmation/devotional type books. All have been very helpful; however, I find this one so much more healing for me as it speaks so directly to the problems I have experienced with periodic depression, hopelessness, fear and anxiety. Rokelle Lerner obviously knows this ""syndrome"" thoroughly and how to help one reach for and attain the positive thoughts and attitudes that lead to healing."
4,emotionally abused,"No one in my family is an Alcoholic, so when a new friend inquired about this I was a bit surprised. The new friend has been a legal drug abuser and there are other alcoholics and drug abusers in her family. Then later I read a list of attributes of Emotionally Abused persons 'symptoms' they were taken from Adult Children of Alcoholics. My friend shared this book with me. This book is wonderful for anyone that needs help standing up for themselves and seeing value in themselves. This isn't to be selfish. I would urge anyone with low self esteem to read this book.Glenda"
5,Daily Affirmations for Adult Children of Alcoholics (and other dysfunctional families),"This purchase was my third and fourth copy, because I keep giving them away to friends recovering from one crisis or another. No matter what your background, if you are anxious and uncertain you can find a moment of peace to help you get centered for the day."
2,Ho-hum!,"This book just didn't speak me. Compared to her ""Affirmations for the Inner Child"", which is fantastic, I found the affirmations in this book lackluster and uninspiring. If you're an ACOA, buy the afore-mentioned book for some real food for thought, not this one."
5,A Perfect Way to Start Each Day.,"This book of Daily Affirmations is a perfect companion book to any daily meditation books, yet also stands alone and is as powerful as can be. Each day holds a new key for overcoming the negative things I grew up with so that my todays might be postive, uplifting, and hopeful. A true gem of a book."
2,"Standard reference work, though not exciting","As one of the most widely-cited works on nationalism, Gellner's book is certainly worth reading just for the sheer reference value. However, as a scholarly work, it fails to answer the question it seeks to demystify. Basically, it says that nationalism rose in industrial societies where people ""needed"" a new standardized form of identity -- which the ""high culture"" of the nation happily provided. It is a great macro-theory, but when put to the test of historical evidence, it falls short. Why do people love and die for particular national identities? If they just needed some modern standardized form of identity, most any form that enables dynamic communication and interchangability in society would do. In short, Gellner fails to take into account the specific historical cases where group identity, rooted in previous historical experiences, has acquired a national character that has withstood enormous historical changes."
5,pogs,I really love this product and the company that sells it. I have been very happy so far. I have placed 2 orders.
5,Book Description,"Ferrari's Gay Travel A to Z is an excellent guide to gay businesses, services, and community resources worldwide. The book is quite thorough in its coverage of gay commercial establishements in big cities and smaller towns alike, and it is very useful for locating gay and gay-friendly tour operators. Arranging a trip through a tour operator can make international travel a lot less confusing (and many operators can offer advice on clothing-optional travel opportunities). A to Z is also the best available resource for information about special-interest travel services, which run the gamut from all-gay mountain climbing trips to religious and spiritual events to leather conventions. Additionally, A to Z includes a calender of gay festivals, parties, and other events across the globe. This is one of the most comprehensive worldwide gay travel guides available, and it's an exceptional value."
3,cute but smelly,I bought this for my 17 year old son for Christmas. It's really a cute item but the rubber odor is so potent I had a difficult time finding a place to hide it. I kept it in my walk in closet but the rubber smell started permeating my clothing. If the smell weren't so strong I'd give this a five star for a cute thing to put in your kids' rooms.
1,They Sent the Wrong City!,"The Fred Feet First Manhole Mat that arrived at my house looked great! The only problem is that I ordered ""New York"" and they sent ""London."" That left me in the lurch for a birthday present. Don't know how to avoid this type of error."
4,The USA and Socialism,Although I am not quite finished with this book it is very informative and shows how this country is heading towards Socialism because of its polical ways.
3,A marxist critique of Anarchism,This book is a marxist critique of anarchism. I guess you will like the book if you are a communist and want to know why other communists think anarchism is wrong.
2,Too out of date,Buy this if your looking for a book as old as some of the table saws that I and my friends have. While it shows a lot of information there are better more up to date books on the material and processes you should know about when using a table saw. Its almost a collector book for a tool junkie.
2,Cheap Toy,"I would not waste your money on this toy, my 6 yr old daughter got it as a gift and it's terrible, the music is soft and there is no lights on the foot pad, you have to watch the little stand and figure it out, very poorly made. my daughter got frustrated and tired of it, the stand is also very flimsy."
1,Only paid $1 for this at Once Upon A Child and that was too much,"Visited Once Upon A Child today and they wanted $13 used for this mat however it just was clearanced to $1 today so I bought it for my 7 year old girl. I have to say $1 was too much to pay for this mat. I can't imagine if I had paid $49.99 for it how I would have felt. She was so excited, however once home and she started ""trying"" to do the cheer moves she became annoyed at it because it went so fast and by the time she saw the light on the board and looked down to see where to step it was on another step. Now it will go into the toy box until who knows when."
2,Not enough intuition,"This book is very mathematical and provides little to no intuition on how Adaptive filters work. Also many LMS variants are not discussed, but left as exercises and problems. For example, Leaky LMS is listed 6 times in the appendix, and 5 of those are problems.Good for a detailed mathematical discussion, but not good for intuitive understanding."
4,Very good,If you have read Haykin and felt like it is the DSP equivalent of Proakis - then this book will lift your moods. The first three chapters are especially good.
4,A pragmatic book full of do it now advice,"Marketing Your Small Business for BIG Profits. This is a simple, skinny and pragmatic book full of do it now advice. Written for a small business audience, there is still very good advice for the tech industry, which tends to view marketing in a simplistic and out of date fashion. ( And we are supposed to be such ""smart"" guys in this industry. )So how is marketing really working for you? ) His appendices are worth the price of the book, such as ""The top 5 most powerful headline formulas. EG No 1. How to Headlines----->How to pay less taxes and keep more money for yourself."
4,No newbies!,"Newbies steer clear! These dances may be complicated enough to make you look like a pro on the dance floor, but they require some practice to master. Fortunately, these dances are fun, so practicing isn't a chore. I appreciate that Shawn likes to provide alternative steps where appropriate, so I can be creative and still be in time to the rhythm. Newbies, take a look at Shawn's Party Line Dances."
3,Good Information Trapped in an Editor's Nightmare,"The bottom line is that Stambaugh offers up a lot of information in a reasonably small volume, making it interesting and accessible. The only fault, besides an overtly unapologetic Romanocentric view, is that his prose style is somewhat redundant and pejorative. With each chapter he lays out the information he plans to present, and then drifts back and forth between examples. At the end of each chapter he presents a succint and very readable summary of his findings. That is, essentially all of the information you need is available in approximately one-tenth of the text. Nevertheless, this is a fascinating account of the architecture and engineering of the ancient city of Rome; most interesting are his accounts of the representation of the city in the Hellenistic Era. Recommended."
2,so-so,"This is edited totally in weirdo, director-wants-to-be-best-friends-with-the-subject fashion! For example, one of the discs becomes ""The Richard Tuttle Show""...we are introduced briefly to a couple artists and then we never see them again, however, most of the 53 or so minutes are spent watching Tuttle wander around his house with bizarrrrrro country-esque musak in the background (well, mostly foreground). What happened to all the other great artists we saw for a minute? I want to show these pieces to my BFA and MFA students, but they have turned into ""How to Critique This Video"" assignment instead. Watch Art21 if you want better and more scope for contemporary artists. Oh, and there is something really boring about watching it and the extra interview section. Why? How?"
4,"SportTrak a great tool , at a great price!","This is my first GPS but I did some research before spending the money. The SportTrak is compact and lightweight,has a long battery life and is surprisingly accurate. We take it traveling to see distance,path we took,speed we are driving, where the next city is... and Geocaching! A great family hiking, hunting activity where the GPS comes in handy for the cache. The screen is easy to read and understand. It has a back light for nighttime use. We have had ours for two weeks and are truly glad we picked this SportTrak unit."
5,Red Grammer BeBops Like Nobody's Business,"Red Grammer's Be Bop Your Best is an extremely sophisticated CD for children, but simple enough for the kids to sing along. As usual, Red teaches the kids such important lessons through his marvelously written, produced and sung songs. I highly recommend this CD for any person with children."
2,Don't call it a 4-deck shoe.,"I turned to this retailer after going bust with another (the 6-deck shoe they gave me was cheap, scratched, and broken).When I deal for private events, I like to use 4 decks so this dealing shoe appeared to be perfect. However, that was not the case. This shoe is the SAME SIZE as a 6-deck shoe, so you're not getting a sleeker and more compact product just because it says ""4-deck"". The quality of plastic is probably slightely more durable, other than that you could not tell the difference between a ""Fat Cat"" dealing shoe and other dealing shoes on Amazon.It's more of the same. Don't be fooled into thinking otherwise.Don't get me wrong, I still use it. However, that's because I refuse to spend anymore money on blackjack shoes especially with the garbage I've been getting. It's serviceable given that it isn't already broken once you receive it."
5,auto ventshade 92601 for Olds Alero,I was so pleased to have found this at such a reasonable price since mine were broken although I haven't got them put on yet. I was happy with this price!
3,Okay But Not Great,"It's one of those books that are kind of interesting but isn't all that gripping. It has a cache of semi-interesting characters, and the plot isn't that great- you can predict the ending from the very first chapter. Not only is it predictable, it doesn't manage to cook up the interesting turn points that well written psychological thrillers have. I only read this book because I had nothing better to do. Still, that's only my opinion- go ahead and read it if you like psychological thrillers. It isn't THAT bad."
2,Apple iBook was a dissapointment,I was very dissappointed with this purchase. It is so slow you could take a nap between clicks. I also have never used a Mac before and it is very difficult in my opinion to use.
4,Challenging trivia,"I bought this game for friend that loves anything 80'S. We played it but even after both of us have seen all the ""I love the 80'S"" episodes, for us born in 1984 it was hard. This game is probably more for someone born in the 70's.The questions were not easy. but it was interesting to try."
2,To big,It make the player ultra big and uncomfortable. Get dirty easily and the plastic turns yellow and breaks with a little of sun
4,My Bad!!,"I ordered 3 of these DLO Action Jacket Case with Clip for SanDisk Sansa c200 MP3 Players. My problem is I needed them for the e200 MP3 Players. I have one that is correct and loved it, so I was going to order my 2 friends one and myself. I messed up. BUT we squeezed them in and made them work.The DLO Action Jackets are great they have the clip and screen protector, just wish they were make for all other Sansa MP3 Players."
4,Fits Sansa C250,Fits Sansa C250 MP3 player. I have had it for nearly two months and it seems durable.
1,Poor Design,"The action jacket(glove) doesn't allow easy access to the controls of the Sansa MP3 4gig flash player. I had to cut out the plastic windows in order to move the control wheel. The glove fits too tight so it is not easy to remove it from the glove to set the sound volume, song choice, etc. It really doesn't seem that the unit was tested for ease of use. I have shelved the action jacket and am using the mp3 player without a jacket. Not a happy 'camper'."
4,Great MP3 Player,This is my first MP3 player and I am very happy with it. The exceseries are expensive but its small size and chip slot make it very usable. The battery lasts almost all day. It has an easy interface and the radio has good range. I can pickup radio stations that I can't get in the car.I do wish it had a clock on the display but that is minor.
5,Beach Days - Fun in the Sun,"Curious George Goes to the Beach brought back all the fun memories of my brother, George, and I at the beach in San Diego when we were little tykes. So fun and totally imaginable! Read it to your kidlets and your grandchildren this summer!"
5,CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THESE BOOKS!,"Kids have enjoyed Curious George books for years! Fun, cute, entertaining and well illustrated. The videos are just as much fun too."
1,Bad kindle version,This is one of the poorly done Curious George kindle versions. Small scan of page with repeat of small type -larger font at the bottom :(
1,Not the original illustrations!,"This book is a huge disappointment! Very poorly illustrated and looks like a third rate copy machine job with pages and then the words all repeated below. Very surprised copyright would allow this degradation of the wonderful original. This looks like a pirated remake. Amazon should screen for such misuse. Not illustrated by the authors but ""in the style of"". This is a rip off!DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION'"
1,Dont buy this for the Galaxy Tab 10.1,Don't buy this if you have the Galaxy Tab 10.1. The format of this particular book is as follows:- The first page will contain what appears to be a scanned page from the original book with extremely small text.- The next page will contain an exact duplicate of the text from the previous scanned page.The remaining pages follow this pattern through out the remainder of the book.What a waste.
5,Great reading!,I chose five stars since the book downloaded quickly and thePages were clear and easy for my daughter to read! I loved reading Curious George when I was a boy also!
2,Dense defense,"This book was so dense, I found it difficult to read. Many sentences had over 100 words in them. After pages and pages of such sentences, I longed for a touch of the brevity of Hemmingway. This density, combined with the subject matter made for very dreary reading. I did not expect a testament of what it would have been like to have lived through World War I to be optimistic in any way, but almost six hundred pages of dismal retrospect was more than I could take."
5,just great,"As I have set myself the topic ""War in English literature"" for my final examination you can imagine that I have to read quite a lot of books dealing with warfare. So far, this is undeniably the best. Brittain's book really is a testament to future generations about the ""Great War"". The content is far too diverse to summarize in a few sentences; let us just say that Brittain managed to capture the spirit of a whole generation.I might add that I think that World War One is the perfect showcase of a futile conflict. Those dealing with world war literature would do well not just to read the literature of one side. For the American reader I can recommend Remarque's ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" or (less known) Kraus' ""The last days of mankind.""In fact, many of these authors (and also many of the war poets) voice the sentiment that the real enemy wasn't the soldier in the opposite trench - it was one's own general staff."
4,Great WWI Living History,"A real sleeper - I'm surprised after reading it that the book isn't more well known. Very well written and compelling. The author juxtaposes the war and it's history with the daily life of the people living it. She's a keen observer of both history and human nature. She does, I think, leave out some history that seems important now but maybe they weren't to her at the time. Highly recomended."
4,Still relevant,"I am fascinated by what led up to World War I and the events during and the minutae surrounding it. Like Robert Graves' fantastic Goodbye to All That, Vera Brittain's work speaks for her generation, for her class, and for her sex. The work is engaging and honest, and with her use of her own diaries, Brittain has remained as true as possible to how she felt when the events were actually happening. I highly recommend it to readers interested in personal accounts of the war, those intrigued by late Victorian and Edwardian middle class life, and students of early 20th century feminism. This is one of the best non fiction books I've ever read."
4,Fascinating,"I began this book unsure of what I would find. Two days later I was glad I took a chance. A powerful book. All the cliches come to mind, of course, and they all work.This book lacks the acid of Graves biography, it's sadder, in many respects it's deeper and has a sense of humanity that one never finds in Graves or Sasson. One should read this book if for no other reason then to look at WW1 with a different perspective.It gives you a sense of what pre-war England was like and what was lost in the trenches, both the physical and spiritual cost. Excellent book."
5,THIS BOOKS ROCKS!!!,"I loved this book soooo much! I fel inlove with Mike and Samantha's characters. Mike's everything I want in a guy. Rich (hahaha), smart, gorgeous as hell...Well, what more can you ask for? *S* I read this book over and over again, I love it too much to stop. This book is the greatest!!!"
3,less than expected,"When buying a J. Deveraux book i usually know that i will enjoy it tremendously. I read most of her books. Sweet Liar started well, but became a little bit boring towards the end. The plot was weak, the relationship was as expected amusing and touchy. (Where are the Taggerts in this part of the world??)"
5,Good Contemporary Romance,"I am not a fan of contemporary romances, but she manages to incorporate history with modern-day time, and make it enchanting!"
5,"My dream man lives, if only in a book.","Many a night I've dreamed of my own Michael Taggert. Tall and handsome with curly black hair. I've imagined his face so often, that I could pick him out of a police line up. The ease of his stride, his patience with the trifles of life. No one would guess that I have dreams of such a man. My professional demeanor and no nonsense attitude belie my true feeling, my yearning for my perfect man. If it were ""me,"" I'd shout such that all the world could hear, "" I too am a woman desirous and worthy of the love of a perfect man."" Hoping, praying that someone anyone would help me find him, bring him to me, I'd stand still, patient, waiting. This display of desperation is no longer necessary, Jude Deveraux has brought him to me. Thank You Jude. I know now that my dream lives, if only in a book."
3,Not really pleased with the story,"I do love her books because I so love the mongemerys and taggerts. I don't like women who are whinny, and have no self-worth. I do love JD books, however, I can't really get into this one."
4,"My first ""modern"" J.D. read...","I've only read historical tales by Jude, so I didn't know if I'd like this one. I did, indeed. A lot of very tantalizing foreplay, FINALLY leading to (seriously!?) not much sex. There were a few times when I wanted to roll my eyes at the pure stupidity of the main character, but a good story nonetheless."
5,Wonderful Service and a great book.,"I have most of this author's books and this book made me want to order the rest. I got my book accurately, the condition is new and the customer service was great. I would recommend this seller and author to anyone. Great service"
4,The New York Taggerts,"Sweet Liar is a good read and kept my interest throughout. Samantha Elliot definitely had a disfunctional and sad life that caused her to be emotionally impaired and depressed. Although her father caused a large share of her misery, he did do one thing right, and that was to send her to New York to meet her ""landlord"" Michael Taggart. Michael is a dream come true, one of the nicest (sweetest) heroes ever! I would have been happy with pages upon pages about Michael, but maybe that would have been too much of a good thing. Samantha should be thankful that Michael was patient toward her or she may have never had a chance to blossom into the spunky woman that she truly was. The underlying gangster story adds to the intrigue. The reinactment of the 1928 massacre toward the end of the book was a little ""over the top"", but the majority of the book is an entertaining read. Jude did a good job with this one!"
3,not one of my favorites,"I've read many Deveraux books over the years and pulled this one out of my pile of previously read books to re-read. I had a hard time relating to a ""heroine"" that was so naive. She had no idea of the cost of her clothes and her not understanding the meaning of ""passing the bar"" was outlandish. She was supposed to be a computer whiz and really smart.Michael had the fairy tail prince thing going, but the charmed life got a little annoying as well. He obviously had more money than he knew what to do with. And his loving family fit a little to conveniently to her story of needing one. It bothered me how many times he put himself out there only to have her reject him again.The gangster element was wonderful. I began wishing that the entire book had been about Maxie and her life and only dipping occasionally to the present with Sam."
1,Booooring,"Based on the good reviews here and on .co.uk I downloaded this to my Kindle and now I would like to find out how to delete it. I found the plot seriously dated, the heroine's attitude irritatingly prissy and illogical and the hero was just a cookie cutter character and one-dimensionally nice. It read like some school girl's attempts at novel writing, nobody's feelings or actions made much sense but because we were told we were supposed to believe. The gangster plot was ridiculous and convoluted and frankly the whole thing went on too long and was boring beyond belief. At one point I thought that it must surely be nearly over and when I checked I'd only gone one quarter through it. Finally I skim read just to see what happened in the end. Maybe it would have been a better read in the 90's but frankly it would still have been badly written in the 90's even if the social attitudes would have made more sense read in context. I really regretted time wasted reading this."
2,No ... thats all I can say ... No,"I've been a fan of Mrs Deveraux, she writes most captivating novels to make my imagination in utter delight, but unfortunately this novel did not do it for me this time.I tried so hard to get into this book and give it a chance, after all it has 4 1/2 starsbut Samantha just so totally got on my nerves she was too dis-trusting and just such a flake! I found myself half way thru the book skipping paragraphs and just quickly scanning the pages for anything interesting ...I did not enjoy this book unfortunately, but it got 2 stars from me cause it still had passion and that thing we call love"
2,Fed up!,"Afraid I just could not finish this book, and this never happens to me! Too many cliches and the main female character was inconsistant and foolish...I could not relate at all. In consequence I could not respect the main male lead who kept chasing her...why? No, no, and no. So I gave up half way, which I am not proud of. The last few days have been frustrating as the plot and story line are so promising.I've put this one away and am about to start 'The Awakening', looks to be more promising going by the reviews."
3,my frist by jude deveraux...,"and not my last. while i enjoyed this story there were parts of it that i was completely bored. because i had to know what actually happened on that fateful night, i would not put the book down, and i wasnt dissapointed in the end.sam, an adult women who has delt with much tragedy in her life, is moved to new york to find the truth of her grandmother. mike, a ""secret"" friend of her now deceased father, is to be her landlord as well as look after her. discovery of the big city brings more than sam is ready for and mike is there to protect her from it.there are many twists and turns in this story, but all in all, the love story within is sweet, the mystery of that night in 1928 is one worth discovering and jude deveraux is an author to read again :)"
5,Sweet Liar,"I absolutely loved this one!!! Jude is an awesome writer!! Now to download Wishes. Great story, as usual :) let's see how fast I read the next one."
4,This was good,I enjoyed reading this book. I've read this author's books for years and usually always enjoy them. Just fun-loving with some mystery.
3,Sweet Liar,"I bought this book because I had read many people's reviews about it. I am not really disappointed but it wasn't as it was all cracked up to be. It was okay. I still think ""Knight in Shining Armor"" and ""The Heiress"" are two of her best."
3,Just couldn't get into it...,I tried but just could not connect with the main character Samantha. She just seemed flakey and had no self worth throughout most of the story. She would literally run and hide every time Mike even glanced in her direction. And then even when they started to get close she acted like he was going to rape her every time he touched her. And that seemed okay because you think maybe she has a good reason to be afraid. But then her reason turns out to be really lame and childish. She also seemed very naive at times. She reminded me of a 12 year old. But I did love Mike and the other Taggerts. And the story plot with the gangsters was kind of interesting. But in the end I found myself skipping entire pages just to finish it. Definatly not her best.
5,Sweet! Sweet! Sweet Romance!,"The hero is the sweetest!i loved this romance. One of the best I have ever read. Jude's romances are so fresh with humour and genuine feelings of characters that u just can't help being touched to ur heart. The way Mike wanted Sam and cudn't have her because she was so insecure... just made me want to cry for him. Sexual tension was electric !There was intriguing plot of sam's grandmother's story too... It surely kept me wondering that what happened on the night so long ago that her grandmother has to live her whole life in hiding... the climax was great! A well thoughtout suspense novel, no loose ends...just perfect romantic suspense!Just my kind of romance... Great Hero, Thrilling Sexual tension, Well Developed Plot, Heroine with a wicked sense of humour and last but not the least an endearing but interfering family... what else cud a romance fan ask for?"
2,Sweet Liar,"I bought the book used, at a great price. I'm a Jude Deveraux fan, but this is not her best book. The main character has ""issues"". I'm reading until the end, but only for closure. If you want a book you can read before bedtime, and have no problem putting down after each chapter, this is the one."
5,Jude Deveraux is the best...Sweet Liar is the best !,I have read every book Jude Deveraux has written. Although I like the historical romances the most this book is still my favorite. Ms. deveraux has a lot of magic when it comes to telling a story. I love the way they are all related. If you have read even one book you have heard about another couple from another book. For my own selfish reasons I hope she never stops writing!
4,Great combination of crime and Romance!!,I read the review of Sweet Liar after reading one of Jude Deveraux's books ( I can't remember which one) but I knew that I definately had to read the whole of Sweet Liar. I loved the way she put together Crime and Romance. The characters are just splendid!! Are there any Micheal Taggerts in this world?? Really good Book!!
4,opinion,"perfeito , superou as espectativas.... o livro e recheado de fotos em alta resolusao,e modo de fazer,entre alguns sushi comum e incomum...."
3,Better books available,"Lots of recipes and lots of pictures. Yet for a book with ""complete"" in its title there are no recipes for pressed sushi. I will use this book but prefer my other sushi cookbook - Sushi, Taste and Technique."
3,"Interesting topics, insufficient depth","I am a cell biologist that was looking for a comprehensive biophysics resource. The description of the book and the table of contents gave me reason to hope that this was the book I was seeking. Unfortunately, despite the book's stated aim to foster dialogue between physicists and biologists, this book assumes far too much of its readers. There is no glossary. Several terms are introduced without being defined or illustrated. Some sections are extremely short, while others spend a considerable amount of time describing examples of questionable relevance to the stated topic. That said, I did find several passages of the book stimulating and thought provoking. I very much liked the description of dead cells being ""at equilibrium."" This book is appropriate for graduate students and higher. I don't think this book would be very useful as a course text."
3,CAR not included !! Cheap quality,"We received this as a gift for my child. He was SO disappointed because unlike the pictures on the box, there is no car in it !! So now we have to head to the store to buy the car. The quality is cheap and its actually a pretty small truck. It can hold one hot wheels size car. He loves it, though. He goes to sleep with the truck. I wish they would have included the tiny car."
3,"A So-So Addition to the Line of Great ""Cars"" Toys","The die-cast metal toys from the ""Cars"" movie are great - detailed, well-made and a lot of fun. The Mack Truck Playset is a disappointment by comparison for a couple reasons. First, it's made of pretty low-quality molded plastic. This makes the detailing blurry and also makes the moving parts feel flimsy and sometimes ill-fitting. Second, it's just not very interesting despite the number of things to do. Aside from pretending to wash and work on your other die-cast cars, there isn't much potential for imaginative play. And even those play areas are very simplistic. Our five-year-old has loved all of his ""Cars"" toys but Mack pretty much stays forgotten in the closet."
5,For the 'Cars' loving little boy!,"My 3 year old son had a ""Cars"" Christmas this year and this was one of the things that we bought him. Well, he is TOTALLY in LOVE with this thing! It has been great for him to find out how everything works... he sees how many cars he can fit inside to ""sleep"". He loves all the little things that can be done inside. Great for fine motor skills! He did have a little trouble opening it by himself at first, but now he is fine. He has learned how to close it up too. This is a great toy! Great Quality and I am thoroughly impressed!"
2,Major Disappointment,"I originally bought this for my son as a birthday present, but decided to give it to him today as a reward for being good during a long day of shopping. I am very glad I didn't save it for his birthday. First and foremost, Lightning McQueen doesn't come with this playset! You have to have a spare Lightning on hand for your child to be able to play. I'm not sure how Mattel thought they were getting away with selling a playset touted as ""Lightning McQueen's action-packed home on wheels,"" without actually including a car for a child to play with.Secondly, the ""amenities"" are seriously lacking. The ""7 play features"" are simply levers that move in different directions.That said, Mack himself is well-done and is a nice size for little hands. It's not a huge toy, which doesn't make it a burden to store.I, however, would not buy this toy again, nor would I recommend it to anyone."
2,Fun to look at but falls to pieces when you play with it!,My son (2 and 1/2 years old) got this as a gift and was super excited to play with it. It looks great but the truck has a lot of little pieces that pop off and and can be reattached if they are not lost. The truck is REALLY hard to open and all the pieces have to be tucked in the right way to close. I find it hard myself to open. It is poorly designed. My son would have enjoyed a much simpler version of this truck. Perhaps an older child would find this toy less frustrating. I also wish they made it more durable like the cars.
3,Fun toy for my son; not very durable for mom,"We bought this toy for my son this past Christmas. He was thrilled and started playing with it immediately! I noticed that the sides of the truck were very flimsy, but didn't think anything of it until I tried to close it up and ""lock"" it. That's when the plastic ""lock"" broke. I was going to take it back for an exchange, but after looking at the way the plastic is made, I realized that others would probably break as well. My son still thinks it's a fun toy, but I am very disappointed that it is not constructed well. My son cannot close it and carry it around as the ""lock"" does not work and the sides of the truck will not stay closed."
1,Absolutely a waste of money,"I bought for my 2 years old boy and one small piece had been broken within 2 weeks. And my son seems not to be interested on it after a few days' play. I seldom regret so much.Yet the difficulty of opening the truck is a good design. This make sure that my brutal son plays the inner part only with the permission of an adult. Thus, the risk of damaging the components is somewhat lowered."
2,Stick to the age group on this toy,I got this toy from Amazon for my B/G twins because they love the movie Cars. My kids are 35 months and that's younger then the age requirment on the toy. But it's to easy to break. My daughter pulled off one of the foam car wash rollers and was chewing on it. The door on back comes off easly all the time but it can be fixed.
3,OUR FAULT...,I SHOULD OF LOOKED AT THE DIMENTIONS... I THOUGHT THIS WAS A BIG PLAY TRUCK... IT IS NO BIGGER THAN FOUR LITTLE CARS LINED UP IN A ROW...OTHER THAN THAT... MY SON LOVES IT.. AND IN THE END... THAT IS WHAT MATTERS...BUT PERSONALLY... I WAS DIAPPOINTED
3,Mack Truck playset,"This toy externally looks like the Mack from the Cars movie. I was a little disappointed that the trailer was all plastic. It was a little difficult for me to open the trailer, but my granddaughter (age 5) didn't have as much problem as I did. The grandchildren rarely open the trailer to play with the attachments inside, rather opting to put extra cars inside."
4,"Son, 3, loves it!","My son is 3 (almost 4) and he really loves playing with this mac playset. Some of the parts come off but are easily put back on. My son actually likes it because he gets to ""fix"" it. I would recommend this especially if they liek the Cars Movie."
5,My son's favorite toy!,My 2-year-old loves this toy- the only problem is that some of the parts are easy to lose!
4,Cars Mack Truck,"My three year old loves this truck. It is pretty durable but the little parts do pull off and can get lost or swallowed. Overall, this is a pretty fun toy."
3,Eh. Not made well esp for the money,It doesn't seem to be made very well - kinda flimsy - especially for the money. It's also smaller than I expected although that's my fault for not looking up the dims.
4,"""Small AND Cheap Doesn't mean bad""",These speakers are quite small and somewhat powerful. They are great to put on a nightstand or for taking on trips when you'll be near power supply. Will fit easily in a laptop bag for watching movies. The little blue light is very bright which you may like or not i did at first and now i really don't. If you want a cheap set of speakers then go ahead and you wont regret it.
2,small speakers,"These speakers sound exactly like they appear, small and cheap. I would not recommend them for anything other than the most minimal applications. If you listen to music or watch movies or videos on your computer, then look for a better set of speakers. The sound these make has no ""depth"". I had them repackaged and ready to return after the first hour I owned them."
1,Worst speakers EVER,I have never heard so much awful sound come out of something so small. These were simply the worst speakers ever. They are scratchy and tinny and you have to turn the volume all the way up and that makes them hiss and buzz. I hope they were defective-- thats what I said when I returned them-- because I can't believe any company would sell something that was this terrible. Oh and the silver-- it is just a bit of paint on the front. The speakers are actually white.
2,Pffttt,"There are no instructins of anykind or anything with this item, and it says it is also a 5 gig mp3 player, well it comes with no software or anything else. If all u want is speakers to plug in its your bag if u want more forget it"
3,Not what I was hoping for,"This book introduces children to the concept of remainders, and in a round about way, division. The problem is, children who would be learning this type of math may find the story to babyish for their tastes. There is no point to the story of marching ants other than to show that there is always one odd-ant out until a group can be formed to include all 25. As my son pointed out quickly in the book--""just use rows of 5 and be done with it"", as well as, ""why must that ant always be the one left out--he should just switch places with another ant!"" Out of the mouths of babes! He suggested 3 stars on a scale of 1-5 and that is about right. I can see this book being used by an educator as a starting to point in a classroom to discuss equal groupings, but do not look for it as a good bedtime story--the story alone is not compelling. I would check out a copy from the library before you invest in the book for your own collection. It may not be one that is read over and over again."
2,disappointing,"We loved ""One Hundred Hungry Ants"", written and illustrated by the same team, but ""A Remainder of One"" is flawed by having language that is more advanced than the mathematical skill it is intended to teach. I would recommend it for a child who is advanced enough in language to have no problems with the meanings of words such as ""former"", and ""infantry"", and yet slow enough in math to need the lesson that 25 leaves a remainder of one when divided by 2, 3, or 4, but not 5. I spent more time explaining to my six-year-old child that the sergeant is Joe's boss, and that ""former"" means what he used to be but no longer is, than I spent on reading the book! The attractive block-print illustrations lack the clever jokes of those found in ""One Hundred Hungry Ants"", as well."
3,"Good Information, Lousy Editting","I read the Stalingrad book and loved it for it's tidbits and good photographs. I was expecting the same with the Kursk book.The information is there. Some nice tidbits, but most of it is the same as other books present. The photos are nice, but there is a severe lack of decently detailed maps. Even the battle of Prokhorovka map shows only the German divisions (labelled with XXX which represents a corps btw...)/Russian corpsThe pictures are good. The side tidbits are nice.The editting is terrible. This is a real pet peeve of mine... There are whole sentences (maybe even paragraphs?) that are missing. Places where they changed a word to another still has both words in the sentence. Section headings describe one thing and the text talks about something else. I could understand a couple places where this can happen, but the book runs rampant with these kinds of errors.I would give this a 4 if the editting had been better."
5,Required Research Material : STRONG Recommend,"Outstanding, well written, great maps and supporting vignettes.This book is a great resource. It provides great background information on the key players and events that lead up to this great event in history; but, also places a heavy focus on the first 24 hours of the Operation and on two key players: The elite II SS Panzer Corp and the Soviet 5th Guards Tank Army during the crucial first phase of Unternehmen Zitadel (Operation Citadell). The book is rich with illustrations, maps, photos and explanations and is a rich source of information for both the novice and the experienced student of the Eastern Front.It has great appendice's, the Soviet and German Order of Battle, a great bibliography and supporting internet/web sites references.Terry Tucker, Professor Military History/Studies (US Army, SGM,Ret)"
4,[A real help to novice and expert alike],"Kursk: The Vital 24 Hours by Will Fowler is a boon to both the general reader and the specialist. In his coverage of the largest tank battle in history, Fowler presents a remarkably thorough overview of the events of July 5, 1943 when the German and Soviet armies decided the ultimate fate of the Eastern Front.Readers with little knowledge of the battle will find Fowler's work most helpful. Those already familiar with the basic events will find a detailed and insightful summary of the actions of the two armies and the decisions of their commanders.Fowler manages to convey a stunning amount of detail on weapons, geography, and men without letting his work get bogged down in minutia. The maps are excellent."
3,"Great chair, once you get one that works","I love this chair - great for watching movies, listening to music, and playing video games. The sound is great, and the chair is pretty comfortable. It lacks lumbar support in order to get that big thumping bass in your lower back, which I think is worth it.Getting a chair that works was a bit of a problem. I bought 2 chairs on amazon, and one came with a faulty right speaker. I called the company that makes the chairs (as instructed), and they promised to send out a new one. I called them a week later to see if they had sent it yet, and they hadn't - but they promised it would happen right away. This repeated once a week for 6 weeks. But finally the new chair came, and worked great. They didn't want the broken one back, so that part was easy.So as long as you aren't in a hurry, I'd recommend getting this chair."
3,"Great chair, wires a bit of a hassle","My son received this for Christmas last year. For the most part he has used it with his gaming system and ipod. The fact that it has to be plugged in, makes it a challenge to have it in the middle of the room. So when it's not in use the plug has to sit on the floor next to it or right on it (no storage found for the power brick)....which means I have to be careful when vacuuming around the chair (for fear of sucking up the cords). The novelty of it has already worn off with my son and now it's just a chair."
2,"Kim, Mimi, Jeff: Just Say No!","These very successful film people should not have remove their clothing to enhance any screenplay. Sorry, but not many undressed middle-aged people can convey an alluring sex appeal in the presence of youth without revealing an obvious predatory motive.All of the performances were excellent. Unfortunately, the story stunk. But then, years ago, after John Irving gagged me with the first one-hundred and fifty pages of The World According to Garp, what did I expect? For John Irving fans everywhere, go ahead and eat it up. For discerning film viewers everywhere else, ask yourself if there is a scene in film history more unbelievable than the endlessly grieving Marion(Kim Basinger) seducing a young man who was around the same age as her deceased sons."
1,Horrible.,"The Door in the Floor is the worst film of 2004. I was expecting a seductive and tension-filled drama but all I got was adults acting like petty children. Kim Basinger performance is so wooden and Jeff Bridges is just terrible. Elle Fanning is the only actor who shows promise (the younger sis of Dakota Fanning). This film comes off as a heart tugging drama and then all of sudden tries to be a dark comedy. This film is awful, awful, awful. Stay away from this muddled downer!"
3,Button-sized review from my Archives,"A children's tale is the figure that this movies tries to match. A violent and morbid tale, full of treason and hypocrisy. And for what purpose? It is a funny film in its own way, but after is finished we only receive a strange feeling that weirdness and intellect are empty qualities that doesn't make life better. I don't find much to be happy here, and I'm sorry about that because the movie in itself is a pleasant experience (when is playing)."
4,"An enigma, but worth seeing","I hope you have the same type of experience I did with this movie. At times it seems outrageous, and other times subtle in it's representations of soul-wrenching sadness. The characters are presented as extremely flawed, making our reactions and responses real and complicated. It's one of those films where I sat in mild shock at the end, with an admixture of emotions. If you liked ""The Ice Storm"" check this one out."
3,BRIDGES,"Yes, Jeff Bridges is superb, but ""The Door in The Floor"" doesn't add up to much. Aside from the bland symbolism of the title, the film is only a romantic drama leaning heavily on the sadness of post-grieving parents adjusting to life after the death of their teenage sons. The details of that tragedy are given more importance than seem necessary and the film ultimately centers on a ""Summer of '42"" plotline and Jeff Bridges' breezy seasoned performance."
2,waste of time,"Did not even finish the film, could not care less what happens to the characters in this mess, wish I had the 45 minutes back that I wasted watching this."
2,THE DOOR IS A BORE,"Aside from the strong performance from Jeff Bridges, THE DOOR IN THE FLOOR is simply a bore. Parents lose teenage sons in automobile tragedy (been there done that); young aspiring writer comes to aid alcoholic and philandering children's novelist and ultimately falls in love with the novelist's wife (Summer of 42?); little girl whines and squeals about the pictures. Based on John Irving's novel, the movie moves so leisurely and has such little ""oomph,"" one can only hope the movie pays off in the end. For me, it didn't. Kim Basinger sleepwalks through her role; Jon Foster adapts an arrogance unfitting his limited knowledge of the world; and Mimi Rogers gets to show her boobs, butt and other vital parts, and run around chasing Bridges with a knife. I feel I wasted two hours on this one."
2,Wouldn't recommend it,I thought the movie was slow in many spots. It had some comedy. Just felt it was lacking a great storyline.
1,"Pretty Dissapointing, very Dark","Other than for the stars that were in the cast, I never would have bought this DVD."
1,Why did it say R rated?,"The mainly reason I put only one star, it shouldn't be saying ""R"" rated when there too much of nudity and a child would say thing to daddy ""your p_en-- ..."" go figure! Yea!!! he does let daughter see him naked but what is that? It is really tacky. I consider it as a child abusive or incent. She aint even a baby.There also a young man shows how he mastubrates twice and few sex goes on. I really don't pay attention later on, because it is just so senseless with a lot mature things going on.It should be in XXX or something. It aint something you would want watching around kids, It definetly aint a romantic movie. Its scene only happens for a few mins then profanity/sex such as nudity goiing on longer. It happen over again after normal scene. So don't watch aroung anyone that is uncomformatble w/ nudity. You never know when it may pop up."
1,depressing.,Depressing movie. No redeeming characters. A real downer. However if that is what you are looking for the acting is pretty good.
3,A little anemic,"This is an adaptation of one third of a John Irving novel, but it seems to flow with little loss. Jeff Bridges is great, as usual, as the louche author/artist, but Kim Basinger is a bit wanting as the grieving mom who has an affair with her hubby's teen assistant because the teen reminds her of her dead son. Ick. The ending is strange, literally depicting the title, but not seeming to mean much for that. Worth watching as an adult drama."
2,"A poor copy, not a used original","The video came on time and undamaged. That was the only positive. This video is not a used original but a poor copy. I suppose that is the risk you take when you buy ""so called used video""; some, like this one, turn out to be copies. I do not recommend buying this video from this source."
5,Great introduction.,"I became interested in Genetic Programming after hearing one of the professors at our university lecture on it to a small group of students and other professors. I asked what book might be a good starting point and he pointed me here and i'm glad he did.This first volume in the Genetic Programming series of books by Koza is very well organized and clear in its explanations. I have not tried the techniques presented yet, but I have some good ideas on how to proceed. The author uses LISP as the language of choice in the book, but practically any modern language should be sufficient.If you have any interest in Genetic Programming, I encourage you to at least pick up this first volume and read through it. This technology is still relatively new and the application of the techniques seems virtually limitless."
3,Very weak,"I read the book Mixed Messages by Jahanna N. Malcom. The book was not a satisfying read. The book was about a senior named Jade who was a musician. She had a huge crush on the high school hottie Zepher who was the lead singer in the hottest band at Wheaton High. She wrote a note to Zepher, proclaiming her ultimate crush. Her friend put it in the wrong locker. And Jade started to hang out with the ""nerdy"" guy from her school. It was a easy read. I am sure a elementary student could follow along just fine. The structure was weak and was very predictable. I wouldn't reccoment this book to anyone."
3,Interesting,"Mixed Messages is definitly not the best book I've read, but it did the job i guess. The plot is so thin, and it takes forever to really understand the point of this book. This book was a nice light summer read, but definitly not on my top 10 list."
2,Pretty lame,"This book was so not worth the time I spent reading it. Luckily, I got it from the library and didn't have to pay one red penny! It is cliched and so boring. The characters are boring stereotypes. If you are looking for a fun girls series I suggest you check out the ""Mates, Dates"" or the ""Truth or Dare"" series by Cathy Hopkins."
2,Boo!,"Omg I cant believe it. When I read the review of the book, I though ""ok.... looks good."" but this book is sooooooo not good. The font is like 16 px~! If you would make it 12 (like a normal book should have) this book would have like only 40 or so pages!~!~ Thats awful! And the plot... omg this book is so bad. I dont recommend it to ANYONE!"
3,Mom of 2,This is a great item. BUT its a one time thing. The bulb has been glued in so that when it wears out NO MORE LAMP. Its very relaxing for the kids. I use it in their room for a night light I just wonder how long it will last. The shipping was pricey and the packaging was awful. Overall okay deal.
3,Frustrating.,"I want so badly for this item to be perfect, so I can write a perfect review.It has advantages. It's very easy to use, my grandmother has had no problems carrying the remote with her, there is no monitoring service or monthly fees involved. Just press the button and it starts dialing the numbers you program.The theory gets five stars. In practice, this only gets three. We're having one major problem with this device: when an answering machine answers at the first phone number we've programmed, the Telemergency does not move on to the next call. It spits out its message and stops dialing.Every number on the list has an answering machine or voice mail. I don't think this is unusual these days. This should be able to handle answering machines, but it doesn't.I'm concerned that someday help will be needed, but 911 won't get called because ""We pressed the button,"" and assumed that the call would go through."
1,"Idea is right, performance was poor",Not certain if we received a faulty unit. Best of performance was 20 foot range through a single wall. Worst of performance was no response to pendant. At times the unit speakers would buzz and had to cycle power to resolve. Amazon return policy was good.
4,Excellent Investment for Older Parents/Persons,"This is just awesome. All the person has to do is press the button to call for help. We used it the first evening. The only drawback is that it's very easy to hit the button accidentally--that's happened 3 times. However, for a small amount of money, you can't afford to let senior family & friends be without it"
2,Well It was Okay,"It was interesting to find out how the time machine came to be and yes the name is misleading as Conrad from the series is nowhere to be found.The book itself was okay. Most of the story could have been written in two long chapters and a lot of if seems to be filler. While the story has an ending, it was sort of unsatisifying as if there will be a sequel in the future. To be honest I cant make heads or tail of this book. I sort of liked it, but it was too short, too much of it dealing with the sexual escapades of the principals and then seems to end at the point where it could get interesting.If you like the Conrad series, I would buy this book just to know how the time machine came to be and who is Conrad's American cousin.If you never read the Conrad series, please dont read this book until you read the series first."
1,Prequel in search of an ending,Disjoined plot lines interspaced with adolescent sexual fantacies. I consider myself one of Leo's fans and was very disappointed in this effort. Have read all of his previous SF works and consider some of them masterpieces. This one I almost couldn't finish because it never went anywhere interesting.
2,Conrad's Time Machine,I ordered this book as soon as it was listed on Amazon.com. There was no description at that time and I assumed this was a continuation of the Conrad Stargard series. Much to my suprise the title is a fake. The book has nothing to do with this series. The title was a false come on to sell books.As for the book it is sub-par and does not compare with other Conrad novels.
4,Like the old stuff,"If you're a fan of fast-moving sci-fi you are in for a good trip. Typical of his Cross-Time Engineer series, this prequel doesn't dwell on any one scene long enough to bore you. Frankowski's style seems designed to make the words disappear and the scenes take shape in your mind.Like any good time machine story, there's an unpredictable, though logical, ending."
3,QUE BUENAS NENAS,Me parece una perdida de dinero comprar este video cuando usted puede ver a su mujer nadando en la piscina.
3,Not really Sirens,"While this is fairly OK I would not spend a long time watching it. A couple of the girls are OK, one is not a girl (see knees). If you really want, get, otherwise think twice."
3,Justifications for war well-ploughed,"I have nearly finished and have enjoyed the read. What I didn't realise until starting to read, was that it is a collection of essays on post-911 events and the use of language, some up to seven years old. I guess I was expecting some fresh insights from more recent times, as a lot of the ideas have been well-ploughed. I am a bit of a political junkie however, so the book might suit a more general reader coming fresh to the topic. Lesson learned: delve more into the preview material before clicking through to purchase. I don't think I would have bothered if I had done that."
4,Worth Reading,"""Loving in Flow"" is written in an easy to read, unpretentious and entertaining style. Dr.Susan Perry's credentials and experience are impressive and lend credibility to her message. Setting her apart from the authors of many self-help books about relationships is her refreshing viewpoint that these are not the things you MUST do to improve your relationship - rather, she gently delivers insights for your consideration - to be used if appropriate, and discarded if not. Reading her book opened my eyes to several areas for improvement in my own life. It also helped me understand and identify behaviors (both good and bad) in others. I guarantee that if you read Perry's book, you'll learn something useful about yourself that you didn't know before."
5,Mighty Real!,"Wonderful film. Well made, intimate... incredibly revealing. The scenes with Michael Ray Charles and his children are my favorite... did you notice the whisky bottles sharing space with paint bottles on David Deutsch's workbench??How true is that of artists, of people? And seeing Ed Ruscha so relaxed... wow.The Art City films let you meet the people behind the 'artists', -- you are allowed to forget that these A-list art stars. The result is that you feel empowered... that you, too, can make worthy art; all you need to be is yourself.Thanks!!"
5,amazing cd,"i have lost and purchased this cd 3 times over the years, a classic for hard trance, one of the best i have owned"
5,AWESOME!,"Loved it. I need more! It's great for record book keeping in the Young Marines of Charlotte, NC!-Unit Commander Bernash"
4,Great selection for one entering the field!,"This book contains a lot of general information about the library profession. As an individual getting ready to embark on the M.L.S. journey, I found it useful. The title includes basic information on the history of librarianship and the players in today's profession. There are different sections concerning the overall purposes of public and academic institutions and information centers. In addition, the book describes the ""professional functions"" of different jobs in the aforementioned sectors. Particularly useful was the information on selecting the perfect M.L.S. program, as well as the job placement section, which details what one should expect from a job interview and the first job. Priceless resources like job lines, listservs, and other reading were also listed."
4,Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis,this book provides a concise and fundamental look into algorithms. Excellent book if you want to learn performance time and running time on your written code and gives you the technique to speed up your code. It does not focus too much on what kind of programming language you use and it is to be read in a general sense.
1,Not for the faint of heart,"I took a data strutures course that used this book. First you have to know C, not C++. You will be dealing with structs not classes. Know your pointers very well. The algorithms are covered are the general ones found in most textbooks dealing with algorithm analysis, but the examples provided are not complete and very vague. You have to rely completely on your instructor to spoon feed you the explanation and if your instructor sucks, then you are out of luck. There are much better textbooks, that take the time to give full explanations of the various interesting data structures out there. God bless and good luck to you if you are using this one for a DS course."
2,Warning,This book is not meant for the beginner and intermediate programer. The author intended this book for the elite. Don't buy this book if you don't have a background in Discrete Math or have Master the c language. Wouldn't not recommend this book to colleges who have a Data Structures class for undergraduates. The code in the book assumes that you can piece together the individual functions to write a full program in c. Also There is no problems that a student can try on his/her own and then find the answer in back of book.
1,DIED IN TWO DAYS,"Bulb stopped working in two days. I purchased, hoping to save a little money, and should have just purchased at Petco or PetSmart instead. Huge disappointment as this was the one that I needed most!!! Won't be buying from this seller again. Bulb was not wrapped very well. Purchased other watt bulbs, from other Amazon sellers, and they were wrapped very well and still are working.Zoo Med Nightlight Red Reptile Bulb 60 Watts"
1,Worked nice for turtles; lasted about 3 months (Revised),"I used this light bulb as a basking lamp for my two yellow bellied sliders. They would enjoy it, so no complaints there. However, after 3 months of discontinuous use, the filament broke. I always turned it off during the night at around 12am and turned it on again during morning. Maybe it would have lasted longer if I kept it on 24 hours like it was designed to do?Bought a second one on Amazon again. This one lasted only a month and a half. If anyone can find a better value with a different bulb please leave a comment."
4,Reptile Red Bulb,I think this bulb is great for my 40 gallon zilla critter cage bredder only if zoomed would make this bulb too last more then they say it does.
1,Lasted 12hrs,"Really not happy with this bulb, bought it for my little sulcata and keep on at night for 8hrs and after the second night of being on for 3hrs it blew.. $7 is alot for a bulb that blew only lasting 12hrs.."
1,Lasted less than 3 nights,"Installed it Friday evening and it burned out sometime Sunday night. Now I'm trying a Zoo Med Nocturnal Infrared Incandescent Heat Lamp (also 100 watts), but I've had similar bad luck with that model and every 100-watt red heat lamp I've purchased from Amazon. Could it have something to do with shipping? This one was shipped with heavier items but didn't seem damaged. All the lower wattage heat lamps (including Exo Terra Night Glo) have worked well, but they've never been shipped with heavier items."
3,Great manual,"gives you the procedures for just about anything, not the best but you get your moneys worth anmd more!!!"
1,Does not fit 2010 Dodge 2500 Pickup - Std Cab,Even though it says it'll fit a 2010 Std cab. It doesn't they will send you one for a 2009 even though the 2010 cabs are not the same size.
2,This was not the best video,There was some good information about Father Junipero Serra but it seems like the people talking just wanted him to look like a perfect man. I think they over emphasized that the Franciscans were nice to the Native Americans when this was not always true. They also had most of there facts wrong about the Native American Indians. Saying that they did not know how to do craft work such as weaving. The other thing that was wrong was that they said Native Americans did not farm. It is true that not all Native American groups farmed but some of them did. I just feel like this video did not have all of the facts right.
2,Title Doesn't Match Contents,"This book is well-written, concise, and offers the uninitiated a good introduction to franchise planning and financing. However, I was disappointed that this is not really a book about ""No Money Down Franchise Financing"" at all. The first half of the book talks about basic business plan development and the second half talks about different sources of financing. But it approaches the issue of financing at a very, very basic level. In my opinion, a lot more attention should have been given to describing what lenders really look for and how to effectively structure your balance sheet, partnerships, etc. The section on SBA loans, for example, is dreadfully thin and, what's more, I have not found anything in this book that really truly explains how to get ""No Money Down"" financing. The issue of collateral is only briefly touched upon (a major obstacle for most borrowers). In summary, this a good business planning book for beginners, but a creative financing book it is not."
3,Are You a Missionary?,I gave this book a 3 star. this is because too many people forget the cost of serving the Lord overseas
5,Great Camp Knife,"I love the Gator II. I have had it for several years now and it has withstood Countless boy scout camp outs and a teen-aged guy putting it through it's paces. Not only has it been used as a knife, but it's heavy blade makes it easy to use as a hatchet when needed. It's locking steel blade make it all around a perfect knife, and it has held its edge for years. I usually sharpen it about once a year, but it's rare that it actually needs it. I also love the way that it fits in my hand with a stockier feel than some pocketknives. It comes with a nylon belt sheath although it is comfortable to carry in your pocket. 100% recommended."
4,handles well,Used the knife this year during hunting season. Although a little on the heavy side it handles very well and I like the feel when using it. Very sharp and sturdy. Very good knife for the money.
2,average at best,Brian wilson is One of the Best Pop Musicians&songwriters ever. but this ain't Pet sounds or His hey day Beach Boy tracks that changed some of the way we heard&felt about Music. these Songs don't really connect.words&Music seem out of place on this set.something about the Arrangements seems lacking for my taste.
1,WAY Over His Head!,"I am a major Brian Wilson/Beach Boys fan. However, this may be one of the worst albums ever made. First of all, Brian's voice...What was once a beautiful instrument is now an emotionless drone devoid of all feeling. He sounds like he's had a stroke. And it's not his age. Paul McCartney is the same age, and can still sing as sweetly as he ever did. His contribution to this album sounds like it was phoned it. Why bother? The layered harmonies are even more disturbing. The songs are sub par, to say the least. How can Brian's people sleep at night knowing they allowed this sad, pathetic album to be released?"
1,You must be kidding!,"I can't believe how bad this album really is. Lyrics seem to be written by a child, and the music is forgettable. If this is the best he can come up with after a 6 yr lull, give it up. The master in masterpiece is gone."
3,"Only ""So-So""","Who am I to critique a musical ""god""? But ""Over My Head"" is not in the same class with Wilson's first or second solo studio almums, nor ""Orange Crate Art."" I have even tried to pretend to really like this album. This has its few moments. It can remind one in instances of a golden past, but as for showing us a current brilliance? Not a chance. Sometimes we're tempted to give a people like Wilson a pass because of what he has accomplished in his life and overcome. Maybe we're awed that he is still composing at all. But denying he has lost some luster still doesn't make the music sound better to those who have ""ears to hear."" Sorry Bri."
4,Really nice album,"So it's not a classic - but hey, do we honestly expect a classic everytime? Truth is, this is a good album - it has many more ups than downs. I'll not list 'em here 'cos you'll get the gist from the other reviews. But I have to cement the view that ""Soul Serchin"" is stunning. Also love the title track. Not much to dislike really - just a feeling that one or two tracks could've been better, including the McCartney collaboration."
2,Disappointed,"This is my least favorite Brian Wilson solo cd. It just comes across very flat with no real energy. The only highlight is Eric Clapton on ""City Blues"". ""Soul Searchin"" may have been a nice idea but lifting Carl's Wilson's voice just does not work. I was looking forward to hearing the collaboration between Brian and Paul McCartney. ""A Friend like You"" is a very ordinary song and McCartney should have been used more. Also, the few seconds you hear McCartney it is obvious that Paul's voice has aged better. Finally, Brian is one of the greats and I am glad he is still creating music. It is just that this is not one of his better efforts."
5,This is a great Brian Wilson CD,"Here's the bottom line: If you enjoy Brian Wilson's music in general, you will likely enjoy this CD. If you don't like his stuff, then don't expect to like this material.The songs here are so intimately and clearly BRIAN. As far as I'm concerned, GIOMH is the richest and most complete album thus far of Brian's solo career.One thing, though: If you approach this album thinking it must either be a new Pet Sounds or else it's a failure, you will probably be disappointed.But why do that to yourself? Listen to this music with open ears and open heart and I believe you will be swept away. This is a wonderful album."
4,A very good album from a great artist,"Is this the next PET SOUNDS or SMILE? No. Does this mean the album is not worth buying? NO!This is a collection of songs showing Brian Wilson at ease. He's not trying to show you what a genius he is. He's sharing his talents one great song at a time. From the straight ahead rock of HOW COULD WE STILL BE DANCING, to the funky rock of CITY BLUES, to the sentimental pop of A FRIEND LIKE YOU, there isn't a bad song on this CD. It may not be Brian Wilson at his very best, but hey, you can't write Pet Sounds everytime you produce an album. Sometimes you just make a very good album that has a wider variety of quality songs than most any other CD you'll buy this year.And, if this album is just too ordinary for you, SMILE will be out in September. Brian has all the bases covered! Certainly one, or both, of these albums will be ""smooth as butter on a bald monkey"" for you!"
4,A credit to Brian,"This album is a great listen for all Brian Wilson fans. It just makes you proud of being a fan of his and must make him proud having songs on it collaborating with the likes of Elton John, Eric Clapton and Paul McCartney. And especially with his late brother, Carl. Gettin In Over My Head has all the ballads and pop songs that we love about Brian. A fantastic listen."
3,"So, Brian - Where's the NEW Material???","While this isn't a bad album, I was hoping for more new songs from Brian. Three of the songs are from ""Sweet Insanity"", and another four are from the mid-90's Andy Paley sessions - all of which have been widely available on bootlegs. I'm not sure if the re-recordings in many of these cases are improvements. Of the new material, ""You've Touched Me"" is a rewrite of ""Little Saint Nick""; the three guest appearances are pretty much wasted (with the Clapton and McCartney songs not very good)...""Fairy Tale"" is first-rate, but ""Waltz"" is a disappointment, coming from Van Dyke Parks. Brian has stated in interviews that he's suffering from writer's block - I believe him. Meanwhile, let's keep in mind that he could sing the contents of a phone book and arrange it so it would still sound great. Also, he's ungodly great live nowadays."
3,Hooks Aplenty,"True confessions. If Brian Wilson broke wind in a bathtub for 60 minutes and put it on tape, I'd be standing in line the night before to snap it up. Overall review of this CD would be it's more than worth the price of admission. Enough hooks to satisfy anyone, typical lush arrangements and quirky surprises. If hearing Carl's voice on ""soul searchin"" doesn't bring a tear to your eye, check your pulse. Brian shows he can still write instant classics (""how can we still be dancin""). Wish alternate mixes could have been included......just when you get a groove on, BW tosses in chord changes, that while interesting, would leave you looking stupid on a dance floor. Production mix strikes me as kind of ""muddy"", Don Was had it nailed on ""I just wasn't made for these times"". I'm just glad Brian's still sharing music with us, and you should be too......"
4,COWABUNGA!,"This is EXACTLY what you wanted to hear from the leader of the legendary Beach Boys on his new solo album! Oh, and the editorial review comment on the duet with Elton John was right on the mark--it revitalizes John's singing after all his self-absorbed recent work--maybe John will be inspired from this and use the energy for HIS next album!"
2,Knight time is the wrong time,"Please, no more Elton, Paulie, or Eric. Also, can we have a few tunes that were not pulled off the scrap heap. I know the Beach Boys are the world's foremost recyclers, but how about an album of new tunes every couple of decades. Go into a studio with Van Dyke Parks and don't come out till you've got 10-12 tunes. I hope it doesn't hurt when I Smile."
1,If you love anything by a particular artist.................,"Well I have just about everything recorded by the Beach Boys. I thought Imagination was pretty good. Maybe this will grow on me, but there is so much poor stuff on so many of the tracks. Why do I need Elton John and Paul M on this cd. If I hear them referred to as ""Sir"" one more time, I just may toss the cd out the window. Clapton could have stayed home too, and unless you're Nat King Cole, well."
2,I miss the old Brian,"I did not purchase the CD but listened to the samples, so this isn't an altogether fair review. After listening to the samples, I was happy for Brian that he can still churn out some fun songs, however, the voice is no longer appealing to me and I won't be spending any money on the albums. I miss the Beach Boys sound from the 60's and 70's and will continue to enjoy that era's music. I feel a bit guilty for abandoning the contemporary Brian's music, but people and times change and we sometimes only want to visit the past. However, he is to be praised for what he's given to popular music and the sweet memories he's provided."
3,No Big Deal,"It's could be said that the mark of a truly important piece of music is the way it polarizes the listeners. You either love it or hate it. You can't be indifferent to it. It seems that is what we have here when one reads the reviews. But really, this collection of songs is neither great or terrible. Lyrically childish, but in spots, musically sophisticated. A couple of great songs (Soul Searchin' and the title cut) along with the banal. I appreciate Brian's particular gifts but they are not on full display here. Just some good light listening, but no big deal."
4,Brian is back......thank God!,"Brian Wilson returns with his first new studio CD for six years and it's been worth the wait. The voice may be a shadow of that in his youth and every day may still be a battle but this is why this record has to be appreciated. Listening to Elton and Brian sing ""How can we still be dancin.."" has you asking the same question whilst the genius of Brian Wilson shines through on the true gem on the album, ""The Waltz"". This song wouldn't have been out of place on ""Smile"" and it not only has a brilliant tune but the lyrics are full of humour. With Brian toruing again this summer and autumn and a studio release of ""Smile"" coming out this is a great year for us fans."
3,The genius is back,"Brian has finally returned with new studio tracks and several are standouts. Overall this is the most consistent of his three solo studio albums. Brian does all the lead and backing vocals himself on all but four tracks. It does however seem like a childrens album at times. Several songs have been floating around on bootlegs for years (Saturday Morning, Soul Searchin', Getting in over my head, Desert Drive), but the reworking of the title track is exceptional. I also belive the closing track ""the Waltz"" is phenominal. Van Dyke Parks has always brought out something special in Brian. (Surf's Up, Wonderful, Cabinessence, Heroes & Villians, Sail on Sailor). A few songs just dont work, Saturday Morning in the city and make a wish and especially the sappy, silly duet with Paul McCartney,""A Friend like You."" If you are aware of the history between the two, you can tell the track is meant with sincerety, but it's just not a very good song."
3,Okay for fans; Where's VanDyke?,"There are some fine musical ideas scattered about this uneven album, which unfortunately does not measure up to Brian's first solo effort, let alone his best work with the Beach Boys, which raises the question...Why is Brian not collaborating with Van Dyke Parks, while they're both alive and well? Surely nothing Brian has done without Parks has come close to their collaborative peaks.That having been said, three or four songs pop out as above-average, including the Carl Wilson duet and the title track, while the rest sounds like circa-1970 Beach Boys filler. Let's hope the re-recorded ""Smile"" blows us away! Brian, we still love you."
4,A Forgotten Gem,"Rita Hayworth is radiant in this film--she just kept getting lovelier and lovelier. Her biographers note that she was pregnant with her first child, Rebecca Welles (Rita was married to Orson Welles at the time), during the making of this film, and maybe it's that maternal glow that makes her look even more beautiful than usual here.Her dancing, as always, is a joy to watch, especially in the physically demanding number ""You Excite Me."" And her acting is terrific too. She had such a lovely soft way of speaking, very sensitive and natural, especially in the one-on-one moments with Lee Bowman (the romantic lead in the film). For a musical, it's interesting that it doesn't have the usual happy ending. The story line is more mature, more realistically reflecting the danger of London during World War II.I highly recommend this film and sincerely hope that Columbia will bring it out on DVD very soon!"
1,An all-time turkey,"This may be the worst musical ever to appear from a major Hollywood studio. Its Golden Turkey status is based on several features: worst sets, worst music, and absolutely the worst screenplay. Poor Rita Hayworth; she was forced to do whatever Harry Cohn, who ran Columbia, commanded. At one point, she and young Janet Blair do a dance in long-johns that is one of the low points in movie history. The choreography is abominable. But then, so is this film."
5,A long lost Friend: YOUR freedom,"I read this book a couple of months ago, it was recommended to me by a wonderful person, Rose. This book has changed the way I feel about a lot of things. It taught me to not only stand up for my beliefs, but not only say to myself "" Everything happens for the best"" , it taught me to believe in that. This book just overtook me, and no matter how many times you read it, it will do it to you again, and again. It is not only a love story, it is a way to free yourself of all those emotional problems, all the stress. This book IS therapy for me.. and maybe I do need a therapist, but right now I would recommend this book to anyone who just wants to get away from this world, away somewhere to heal their soul."
5,Incredible love and life story,"Richard Bach is an incredible writer. The good of his books is that they are autobiographical novels. In this one he tells incredibly well the story of his serach for the ideal woman. If you love airplanes, life, philosophy you'll love this book!"
2,Richard needs help.,"This book was not inspiring to me. I have read many book by authors such as James Allen, Thich Nhat Hanh, Jim Rohn, Scott Peck and others that are more creative and inspiring. While there is some positive thoughts and intelligent writing, for the most part I found myself frustrated with Richards contempt for the IRS, immature view of relationships and endless search for his soul mate. I expected a more realistic description to Richard's life, maturity and love, but received an ego based drama that leaves me feeling short changed. For those who are more emotional and less analytical, you will find more enjoy from this book than I. Happy reading."
5,A Love Story Unlike Any Other,It's not that mushy stuff!It'a all about a man who actually finds his soulmate and how his soul recognizes her soul... It has a light philosophical content on the subject of souls reconnecting in the next life.It's beautifully written. And it's a story that most of us dream about in our lifetime.
2,Nice until the end,"Nice romantic novel, kitchy but nice. But than comes the end, and that is one stupid ending. The last chapters of the book are a disgrace to the human intelligence.Don't read it. Richard Bach as a man is one who lives in a fantasy world without any knowledge of modern psychology."
3,Not quite disappointing after reading other Bach books,"I loved the other books I have read by Richard Bach. The books I have read are ""Illusions"", ""Jonathon Livingston Seagull"", and ""There is no such place as far away"" which is a wonderful children's book.This book isn't bad... but compared to Richard's other books it rambles on pointlessly. This is a good autobiographical account (almost like a journal) of a man falling in love but after the third chapter it just becomes hard to read."
2,New Age pabulum,"A very ""lite"" version of Zen and the Art of Motor Cycle Maintenance. (And what calories that could be gleaned from The Bridge Across Forever were empty ones at that.) Bach has merely given us a book full of platitudes, and what's worse, it seems to have been written with the mass market in mind. For a thoughtful and thought-provoking self-examination, check out Robert Pirsig's aforementioned book."
5,If you thought you were in love.....read this.,"The term soulmate has been thrown around so loosely that it has lost most of it's meaning now a days. This book shows by example what a loveing careing and nurtureing realtionship is and what you sometimes go through to get there. If you think your in love now, read this book and look at yourself. Look at the person your in a relationship with. Look at the people around you. On the subway, in line at the movie theather. After a while and if you do find your soulmate (and nobody promises you will at first so never settle in the meantime) You will look at them and yourself differetly. You will notice what was there all the time but the walls have fallen and you know who's in love and whose settled. Do yourself and your partner a favor. Never settle. Never, never, never. It's nice for a while but when they find there soulmate you'll want to know where your's is. Won't you?Thank you Richard and Leslie.Paul"
5,Yes... but Richard and Leslie got divorced,"I loved this book as well as ""One"" and they had inspired me for a long time. Then I leant that Richard Bach actually divorced Leslie and now has a new young wife. I also learnt that he abandoned his first wife and their six kids. So now I am wondering whether this briallant, wise, exciting story isn't anything more than a beautiful illusion.In any case I recommend reading it. And have these facts in mind because otherwise you can beleive in it too much!"
3,rating is a matter of taste,that's why I do not rate the book. Now I need to fill in 6 more words according to the rules. Here they are.
5,For those who are looking for their star in this life...,"Thinking about our lives, we can identify many coincidences with this story. How much time do we spend dealing with our own dreams, with faces idealized by us, in our resting hours...Meanwhile, happiness is knocking the life's door, asking for a chance, and all we do is keeping ourselves away from that possibility. We need not to be afraid of trying a different way.Try to see the relationship between man and woman from another point of view. Try to identify yourself in this romance. You will be surprised with your reactions.."
5,A dream come true!,"I met this story shortly before I knew something very similar was happening to me: while reading I understood that was MY story, not Dick Bach's one! I bought another copy of the book and changed all the names with the exact ones (only a printing error in the original edition...) and gave the book to the lady who deserved it. Well, since I've married her and we have 2 kids and love each other much more than the first day, the answer is easy: your soulmate does exist, you MUST find her, and this book was absolutely right!"
1,Same old Garbage!! Same old hashed out Love story,"I read this book because it was given to me by someone awhile back, as I expected horrible writing from a guy who thinks he is holier than thou! Do what I say about love blah blah blah and dig a bit deeper he is no different than the rest of the crappy writers trying to make a few buck to write a book. Nothing special here, no story, no originality! I would skip this one."
2,Ironic,"I liked this book when I first read it, though I find it ironic that Mr. Bach is divorced from the wife he wrote this book about."
2,Pass up unless you believe in reincarnation/time travel,"The value in this book I found to be in the demonstration of the main character's conquering his fear of intimacy and failure. Unfortunately, the author spent a great deal of time conversing with his future selves and past selves (time travel) as well as talking about being a tree in a previous life, leaving his body when he wished, and other topics that I found not only annoying, but also interrupted the flow of the book and muddied its message."
1,Yippee ...,... Our Man Bach finally found someone he loves as much as himself. This makes things so very happy! But I'd be much happier if I could have back the 6 hours I wasted on this tripe.
2,Drivel,"Metaphors as soft as the marshmallows, this book is so cringe-worthy that I feel EMBARASSED for poor old Richard. The man described is an egotistical narcissist lacking in emotional maturity or the ability to see outside of his own reality. I am in love, very much in love, and I have all my life believed I would find my soul mate, but this book makes me embarrassed to have ever been associated with such an idea! He has obviously given hope to thousands of lost and lonely souls, however, who are now probably wandering around starry eyed and bumping into telephone poles looking for ""that perfect someone"". Well this is childish, I know, and I can't believe I'm going to say it but ... GET A LIFE, and broaden your horizons! :o)"
3,"Good, but not great.",If you're going to buy your first Richard Bach book. Get Illusions or Jonathan Livingston Seagull. Two of the best books EVER written.
4,A story of soulmates,"""The Bridge Across Forever"" is a wonderful story of a man who was so busy looking for his ""perfect woman"", he almost missed her. Fortunately for him, a few unusual encounters help him to see the light. A great story for anyone looking for perfection in a relationship. Soul mates aren't perfect, because we aren't. Another novel that uses this theme is ""The Destiny of Miro"" which features a soul mate relationship that spans two lifetimes."
2,A Downer,"I read the jacket cover. Loved it. I read the first chapter. Loved it. But after chapter four, and finding out that we're dealing with divorced people over here??? Forget it. I can't accept that. Love stories should be dramatic and pure. Anything less than pure is unacceptable. I'm sorry but I'm an idealist. But I did find Bach's Illusions quite enjoyable."
2,Get My Dwarf Rabbit by Monika Wegler instead,"This book is skimmpy. A complete owner's manual?? Seriously?? I purchase this book along with ""My Dwarf Rabbit"" and the ""My Dwarf Rabbit book"" is a lot more thicker with more detail. And has a lot longer list of Dwarf rabbit breeds. But really, both books are a waste of time. I have a Dutch Bunny and will soon get a mini lop (not a dwarf rabbit) or Holland lop, and both books in specialty will tell you about the different breeds of dwarf rabbits, but care, food etc....there's no real difference from any other rabbit care books out there that I've read. Just saying that if you choose to purchase this book thinking like I did that dwarf rabbits need more specific care than any other rabbit, then don't get this book based on that alone. You may get this book for all the cute pictures though."
5,Basic Bunny,"This paperback is pleasantly compact and concise......a good ""starter"" book for beginner Bunny Mom or Dad. The chapters covered just enough information to master basic, caregiving skills, find products to set up a bunny home, types/sources for bunny food, common health issues and personality traits. For the price, the book provides an excellent introduction to bunny care, without requiring a huge, upfront investment."
2,Undecided,"From a book of this depth and this cost was hoping to find more tips and tricks on the field. Instead, the book is highly technical and largely explains how to use different programs (and recovery equipment) to create panoramas.I have a basic understanding of some depth, so I am not fully satisfied with your purchase.Great for those who want to get started!"
3,Good for novice,From my point of view this book is really good for novice panoramic photographers (or for them that haven't search the net well). It gives some overall information about panoramic techniques and then describes some programs with which you can produce interactive (or simple) panoramas. The reality is that in the Internet you can find find lot more information about panoramas BUT from different sources.Although it is useful this book's price is quite high.
5,A Magical Favorite for the Young and Young at Heart!,"This was my favorite book of Fairy Tales when I was a kid. This was the book that I would read, over and over, with a flashlight under the covers. I still have my copy, and have shared it with friends, children of friends and lovers (who else do you get to read bedtime stories to as an adult?). It really holds up.It was my brother's favorite childhood book too- so much so that my parents had to get us each our own copy! Reading it as an adult I was fascinated with how feminist the tales are. Often it is the clever girl who rescues the prince (or Tsarevich in this case) instead of the guy always rescuing the helpless girl."
3,Functionally good antenna . . . .,"This antenna works as advertised. I picked up all the channels from over 40 miles away that I wanted. So in that respect it works fine.The problem is that the antenna is huge. It's about 13 feet long. The elements are long as well. They are attached to the mast with plastic. So you can imagine, after the first bird lands on it, it breaks. I now have at least five elements hanging down, broken. If birds like to land on your roof, don't use this antenna."
5,Great Antenna,"Went with this antenna after many hours of searching, we live on east coast by the beach, Was not sure if I needed a deep fringe but local antenna man said the best was channel master, why not trust the company that has done it from day one, glad I did no issues, goodbye cable, reception is great pulled in 45 channels, powering two t.vs. Saving 58 dollars a month, also goodbye retard drama reality T.V. better move for the kids. Did not need any pre amps, reception is clearer than cable. Thanks"
2,You Can Do Better,"This antenna may be OK for you but my older version of the ChannelMaster had troubles pulling in stations in my fringe area location. I was about to purchase a replacement ChannelMaster antenna when I came across an ad for an antenna which is much smaller and with better performance. Check out the HD Stacker Antenna at [...]. This antenna was specifically designed for the digital TV spectrum. The cost is $[...] (free shipping when I bought mine) and performance is great! There is a lot of useful advice on the website and you can contact Denny himself (who designed the antenna) and discover their great customer service. With the HD Stacker antenna, I found that signal strength nearly doubled for some of the weaker stations I previously had problems with."
1,NOT GOOD FOR H.D.,"i WAS TOLD THAT THIS WAS THE BEST ANTENNA FOR THE NEW HD. WELL, IT IS NOT. NOW I AM STUCK WITH SOMETHING THAT I CAN'T GIVE AWAY"
2,Antenna,didn't do as well as I hoped took it back down. Did not care much for my antenna didn't have me receive any TV Adolph an area that I live in this went back to DirecTV
3,"finally paid way too much to install, bad job","The antenna seemed fine, but the conman who put it up collected up front, then disappeared when the relatively new mast rotator wouldn't turn it enough to try tuning anything in. No one's willing to climb up the tower and diagnose, let alone fix, the problems."
3,CM 3020 channel master antenna,The jury is still out on this antenna. I still cannot pick up any HD stations. I am over fifty miles from any transmitters. I have gotten new cable and increased height.I may just be in a low area.I will continue experimenting.
2,Didn't work well for me,"I have a vacation home in northern wisconsin. The house is serounded by trees with not tv tower, just a tripod on roof. I have a 20 year old tv antenna and thought, this one would work better. But instead of 6 channels all them UHF I got one. So I'm back to the old antenna, lucked out thought the guy that installed my new antenna, took it inplace of payment. He said he could sell it to someone looking for a new antenna. The antenna guy say reception in my area 'arkdale' is wierd, one house will get more channels than a house just down the street. so my only option now is satillite."
4,Handy pocket dictionary,"This doesn't have quite the vocabulary that larger dictionaries do, but it's super handy and I love the flexible rubber outside!"
1,Worthless,"Never even opened this book for class. Was a waste of money, wasn't even able to sell back for any money."
5,A must have!!!,"This release has plenty of music to please the old and young. Compared to the postal service in many reviews i've read, this goes far beyond postal service. Warm melodies, great lyrics, and impressive vocals makes this one of the best releases of 2006. The older crowd (or open mined crowd) will enjoy ""holly hobby"", ""bobby malone moves home"", ""don't they have payphones..."", ""cold white christmas"", ""new years kiss"". Those mention tracks are melodic, soothing, with powerful heart felt lyrics. The upbeat tracks...""young sheilds"", ""scattered pearls"", ""nashville parthenon"", ""i love creedence"", still carry on with the melodies & great lyrics, and would be choice for club remixers. Amazon should have sound clips for this wonderful release. Not to be missed!!!"
2,Find a Better Moon Landing DVD,"This documentary while informative, traces the whole space program right up until it finally gets to the Apollo 11 mission. The narration with Mr. British Accent was boring and the score with constant bass rumblings and the obligatory high-pitched harmonies was annoying.I recommend the HBO set ""From The Earth To The Moon"" for a trip through the whole space program and look for a separate Apollo 11 documentary."
3,"It never was able to really raise a level of excitement in me, which given my feelings for the space program, is hard to do","As someone who grew up worshipping the American space program, I was thrilled when Apollo 11 landed on the moon. It was and remains the greatest single triumph of science and technology. Over the years, I have watched many documentaries, VHS tapes and now DVDs about the events that led up to the first landing by humans on another ""planet.""However, while this DVD begins with the start of the ideas of rocketry and has some interesting features about the trek to the first moon landing, selecting a narrator with a British accent was somewhat deflating. Far more serious was the pedestrian pace and the music was very poorly selected. It never seemed to really raise a level of excitement, which given my feelings for the space program, is hard to do. Therefore, I can only minimally recommend this DVD."
2,"words, words, words","This is more or less a complete print out of the Autocad Help documents. Might be usefull as a reference but definetly not a book to learn with. I have past experience but it has been a few years since using AutoCad. To get an answer from this book, be prepared to read about every little detail possible and written in a very ""professional"" language - but that's not really necessary. So many words are in bold, it is useless. Seems the writer wanted to write even more but was out of ink. Easier just to use the Acad Help."
3,3 dvd scooby doo,It was good expect one of the discs was damaged in travel but my daughter love other two. The aliens invaders is the one thats crack and won't play.
4,the family exposed,"Reading these poignant stories is like watching 15 or so different versions of American Beauty. Beneath the surface in almost every family lie illness, infidelity, betrayals and anger. This is his first collection of stories and they make for an excellent collection. I had read his later books first like The Lost Language of Cranes which I think are stronger overall, but as a first collection, these stories are revealing.Leavitt has a knack for exposing the underside of family relations. Many of his stories focus on husbands who leave their wives, but just as many focus on the effect these family disputes have on the children. Overall, these stories will leave you with a feeling of sadness -- he touches many nerves from cancer to men coming to terms with their sexuality, to abandoned sisters and brothers. I think Leavitt is a very sensitive writer with an eye for the problems that plague 20th century families."
5,An amazing image of human dynamics with MRI-scan accuracy!,"David was in his early twenties when this was published. His stories capture the essence of what goes on between people, period. Counting Months, which describes the last Thanksgiving of a mother with lymphoma and her worries about her children's future is a tour-de-force!"
3,interesting,"These stories are poignant and very subtle. I enjoyed the first half of the book, but later on it gets repetitive, with the same themes of mothers afflicted with cancer, gay sons, and divorces. I did find the gay aspects of the story interesting because they're not forced upon the readers."
4,A great debut from Ang Lee,"Ang Lee (""The Ice Storm"", ""Eat, Drink, Man, Woman"") directs this story of a Chinese man moving in with his son and an American daughter-in-law. A poignant story of generational and cultural conflict. It is easy to tell the beginnings of a master director here."
5,Excellent movie,"I searched years to find a copy of this film to have and hold for my very own. A great Ang Lee production, this movie, like so many of his other works, addresses issues of contemporary Chinese culture, following an elderly traditional Chinese man as he adjusts to life in New York. Cross cultural, inter-generational and aging issues confront Bo Z. Wang as he tries to find a place in his son's mixed-marriage family. And the push hands sequences are entertaining too!"
4,Ang Lee's first film --,"and noticeably so in terms of budget (thus the four stars), but nonetheless excellent in establishing his themes of the clashes between Eastern and Western cultures, and his synthesis of the two.The actor playing the father next appear's in Lee's lovely ""Eat Drink Man Woman,"" and as Sir Te/Bel Lia in his extraordinary ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon""."
5,TAI CHI CLASSIC,Very simply put this is a TAI CHI classic.Ifyou do Tai Chi or are curious you need this DVD.The film will be understood by TAI CHI practioners and open the minds of those who are contemplating taking up the practice.
5,Very Good,"I love this too . The main contents are garlic, onion, black pepper, parsley, fennel, basil, bay, marjoram, organo. There are others of course but the main taste comes from the pepper, garlic, onion, and oregano. I use it and Lawrys seasoned salt on some cooked foods to perk them up as I dont cook anymore."
2,percogesic extra strength,"It's a rotten deal that they have taken out the one element that made it great and useful to many of us.No they put benadryl in in it, rather than phenyltoloxamine citrate. It's all such a scam for the drug companies benefit not the consumer."
1,Skip this one--buy the other two,"Digital photography is not yet second nature to Peterson as is film SLR photography. For example, Peterson writes ""2048 x 3000 ppi (pixels per inch)"" instead of ""2048 x 3000 pixels""--he just doesn't speak the language yet.Below, Rennie Petersen on May 19 gives the definitive criticism of this book. I own this book as well Peterson's other two books Understanding Exposure, which I highly recommend, and Learning to See Creatively, which I like having but is second to Understanding Exposure. So my review is really summed up in the title."
1,Disappointing,This book is dangerous for those who don't understand the computer side of photography as it is rife with errors. The most painful is in the first chapter where he attacks the JPEG format with unfortunately no understanding of why to use it and how it works claiming simply viewing a JPEG causes it to degrade. Calculations are wrong in terms of how many images of size x will fit in y MB. The list just goes on and on. I am trying to get AMPhoto to allow me to exchange this book as I have appreciated other books of theirs but this one is just horid.
4,Understanding Digital Photography: Techniques For Getting Great Pictures,I enjoyed the book. Good for someone with a basic understanding of his or her camera and ready to take the first steps in improving their photographic skills
5,Superb & Revealing: Valuable and nicely put - highly recommended,"I have bought all Bryan Peterson books, and am somehow sad there is no more to read, so much it's INVITING & USEFUL.As not to remain on my hunger, i have already booked his Sept 06 book ""Beyond Portraiture: Creative People Photography"".I find the content really revealing and the way Bryan puts it makes it so simple yet enticing to understand. Having read all his books and got used to one style of terminology ... i found my photography skills improving S T E A D I L Y..... towards getting it right in the view finder - as he says."
3,A good book.,For beginners mostly. Lots of good pictures by a great photographer and digital tips. For more advanced students there is not much more. I was not disappointed in the book.
3,Nice for the beginner,"For the digital newbie, or photography newbie for that matter, this is a nice intro book. I'm sure that a lot of the techie issues that other reviewers are calling Mr. Peterson to task on will be addressed in a 2nd edition.There is enough information on photographic concepts and techniques to redeem the book for some of the technical flaws regarding digital images (See Rennie Petersen's review for info on the techie stuff).If you haven't read ""Understanding Exposure"" by Bryan Peterson I'd highly recommend it."
4,Very insightful book,"The most I liked about this book is the detailed explainations of photography fundamentals without resorting to lot of spoon feeding and showing off one's own photographs.I also believe there is one serious error in the book. (reason for 4 stars). The books says on page 18:""Every time you open and close a JPEG file on your computer, the file degrades due to data being lost; and eventually a repeated opening and closings, the file would be rendered useless."" !!!Why would a file degrade merely on open & close, unless you repeatedly *save* it ? There seems to be either serious misunderstanding or a serious typo.I believe if should read ""Every time you open , *save* and close a JPEG file in a picture editor...."""
2,Understanding Digital Photography: Techniques for Getting Great Picture,Unfortunately its a bit old now and out of date. The basic information os there but it lack relevance. Anyway you live and learn!
4,Extremely satisfied,I have read and reread and then underlined the important parts for me. I have learned a lot from this book as well as from others since I have not had the opportunity to find a master to learn from yet.If there were more pictures (drawings) to really define the precise sequences it would be very helpful but the whole idea is to learn from a master in person. I have both of his books and used one to support the other and help me understand and follow certain exercises.Still the important thing is to practice... everyday. It has worked for me.
2,Reading & Reading books not for Chi kung,"The only way to learn tai ji quan is being with a master, looking him doing the form. Doing all the parts that conform tai ji included chi kung but with a teacher cause is the best option to feel the art. I think reading books are not the solution so the best is empty your mind of reading and reading and do the task with someone who knows something about it, not necessary a master, all we can learn with others..."
5,Full of Vital Information,"This book is excellent for both novices and experts alike. Not only does Sifu Wong discuss (and clearly explain) Chi Kung sets, he delves into the history of this aicent Chinese art. The best thing about this book, however, is this: Sifu Wong does not lie to the reader! He clearly states that one cannot become a Chi Kung master (or even a good practitioner) simply by reading his book. One must study with a genuine Chi Kung master to fully benifit from Chi Kung training. However, this does not mean one cannot learn a great deal from this book. Even if a person were to practice these sets as a ""gentle exercise,"" rather than true Chi Kung, he would still receive many great benifits from his daily practice (this I know from personal experience). I would reccomend this book to anyone who is interested in Chi Kung practice."
2,"Terrible lack of illustrations,but good text-can't practice.","I found the information interesting,but it's virtually impossible to practice the exercises due to non-specific drawings.The only photograph is on the cover. If you'd like to learn ABOUT Chi-Kung,buy it.If you'd like to learn Chi-Kung,you may be disapointed!"
5,Excellent!,Very straighforward. This is the first practical book that I've read (and I've read quite a few) that doesn't imbed the useful with the arcane.
2,Just as Expected,"When you buy a tape with the Nasty Boys on the front cover, you're going to get a tape like this. Of course, I didn't expect much. It's probably worth half the price on this page, but it isn't totally worthless. It's similar to a ""Before They were Stars"" show."
2,Don't Buy This Tape If...,You are looking for a tape with 4 Star Matches. This tape has nothing worth the price. Later
1,BLATANT JAWBREAKER RIPOFF,"Go buy a Jawbreaker record. These guys obviously did and fashioned their whole sound after them. In fact, it is such an incredibly lifelike resemblence that when I first heard it, I thought it WAS Jawbreaker. Influences are fine, but I can't listen to this without feeling sick at how not only the overall sound of the band, but all the little things that sound like jawbreaker. The guitar riffs, bass riffs, the vocal tone as well as the melodies. Right down to the jawbreaker-esque drum fills. Now, I know Jawbreaker isn't the most original band in the world, but they definitely have a unique sound that you can tell right off the bat that it's them. You might call it a ""signature"" sound. Slowride has blatantly gone ahead and created musical forgery. Its too bad, cuz they are awesome musicians, just not original enough for more than one star from me."
2,Would be a good release if not for the fake audience and terrible 5.1 mix,"This would have been a good release if not for the fake audience and terrible 5.1 mix.Like another reviewer, I sat in disbelief as I watched and listened to this DVD. There is a fake overdubbed audience sound that completely ruins the concert. The fake audience sound is as loud as the music, and consists of what sounds like teenage girls screeming at the top of their lungs, not once coming up for breath. It really is unbelievable.The 5.1 is the worst I've ever heard. It's completely unlistenable. The stereo mix seems to play back okay.The video quality is below average, but okay considering the time period it was recorded. Very low-budget.Take my advice here and skip on this one. The fake audience sound is a definitely deal breaker. Too bad, I was really hoping this would be a good show."
2,"Pass, or Pacify...","Not a good DVD to own. I waited for a Cinderella DVD, and ignored the reviews to see a great live band again. You won't get what you pay for. I wish they had spent some money in their Hey-day and hired a quality video recording of a live appearance. I don't own one, but you might be better off buying a VIDEO'S DVD of them."
2,Poor video and sound quality,"I like Cinderella. I watched them live in concert three years ago and the band still sounded great. However, this DVD has poor sound and video quality. I believe the band performed and sounded better in the Make a Difference Foundation concert in Moscow even though it was recorded in VHS. I am rating this DVD with two stars, because of the mediocre sound and video quality."
2,Would be a good release if not for the fake audience and terrible 5.1 mix,"This would have been a good release if not for the fake audience and terrible 5.1 mix.Like another reviewer, I sat in disbelief as I watched and listened to this DVD. There is a fake overdubbed audience sound that completely ruins the concert. The fake audience sound is as loud as the music, and consists of what sounds like teenage girls screeming at the top of their lungs, not once coming up for breath.

The fake audience sound is a definitely deal breaker. Too bad, I was really hoping this would be a good show."
4,Pretty good release,"Cinderella puts on a great performance here, and I really enjoyed this DVD. Although there are some (in my opinion) weak songs on here, most of the material is to my liking.As others have mentioned in their reviews, there are some issues with the audio. The audience is way too loud during the songs, and the guitars are sometimes hard to hear. The audio-mixing could have been far better on this DVD.But I would still recommend this to any Cinderella-fan out there, since I don't know of any other, or better, concerts of the band, released on DVD."
4,"""Bootleg"".....!!!","As a fan and collector of hundreds of various concert bootlegs, I have no problem with this DVD release. I have always been a fan of Cinderella and hoped that someday, a live show would be released. Well...this is a killer show but the sound quality leaves alot to be desired. It reminds me of a very high quality bootleg and I am happy with that. I purchased it ""used"" through Amazon market sellars, having only paid approx. 7 bucks! The sound is good enough and the show ROCKS.....so spend a few bucks and enjoy it! Highly recommended....."
5,AWESOME...WHO CARES ABOUT THE AUDIENCE TRACK?,"Get real...this concert kicks ass with every Cinderella tune you could possibly want. This is a raw, kick butt show, with no behind the scenes BS...just straight music! KISS ALIVE 2 had a fake audience track also...so what? If you want MTV produced nonsense...you have the wrong video...if you want raw, kick ass rock and roll...you have the right band...CINDERELLA!"
5,Excellent Book,".. A sad fact about an ethnic group that has served other Nations with distinction whenever it was called upon. While a lot of this information in caroe's book is not as relevant as it used to be, it remains the best English book on Pashtuns. For a more contemporary book I recommend read Spain's The Pathans of the latter day."
3,It has potential.,"This is more of a newsletter than a magazine. The articles are interesting, but not intriguing. I get the impression it is ""published"" on a mimeograph machine in someone's basement. The subject matter is not the problem. I have been looking for a publication with just this subject matter. This is not what I've been looking for, however. I was hoping for a more professional magazine with meatier articles. I'm not going to cancel my subscription, as I am an optimist. However, I'm not sure I'll renew when the time comes."
3,"Be careful with this, you could ruin a cigar!","The first time I used this punch, I split the head of the cigar a half-inch down both sides! Thank goodness I wasn't using it on one of my better sticks. I recommend practicing on a cheap stogie to get the hang of it. Just use light pressure, and rotate it back and forth while gently forcing it into the cap of the cigar, don't push it straight in or you will damage the cigar like I did.On a positive note, once you get the hang of it, you are less likely to damage a cigar than you are with guillotine cutters, and cause the wrapper to unravel."
3,cigar punch hole cutter,"This device works OK. The retractable blade is a very nice feature. And grip texture is good and came in handy. The blade is not very sharp, I had to force the cut when I used it the first time. It is OK, but I would not send my friends out looking for this one."
5,Cigar Punch,"A neat punch. I used to have a lighter that had a punch in the end of it, but it broke off. I bought this thing several months ago, and have nad no problems with it at all. The only thing is that the button to retract the punch can be difficult to find; it took me a mintue to find it, but it's not a problem now. I actually bought 2 of these and gave one to my father, and his works just as well as mine does."
2,Grave Disappointment of Cruz Smith,"I am more than an avid fan of Mr. Martin Cruz Smith. I own a complete collection of his works. Either I read the book hype wrong or else I have mis-judged Mr. Cruz Smith's ability as a writer. Except for the excerpts by established time honored writers: Mark Twain, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Guy de Maupassant, I find the book mundane, deplorable and a disappointment that Mr. Cruz Smith attached his name to it. I found bad usage of grammar, stories that lost the development of the plot, confusion of character identification (Frederick ?)and just poor mystery writing overall.Amaturism personified. Mr. Cruz Smith, did you read the book before you affixed your name to it? I will gladly sell it if I thought I could recoup my costs. This shakes my confidence in Mr. Cruz Smiths future writings and whether or not I may purchase them."
4,Not bad at all,"All collections of short stories are going to have their hits and their near-misses. Fans of Sherlock Holmes will welcome the inclusion of the ""The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans"", though it's not one of Conan Doyle's best. Ed Hoch leaves a hard-boiled little ""noir"" twist at the end of his ""Enemy Territory"" and Guy de Maupassant is at his Frenchified best in ""Two Fishers"". In his introduction Martin Cruz Smith says that the espionage story has entered a golden age and these tales show flashes of that."
5,Great travel charger,"This inexpensive charger at Amazon is great. It's a really nice and thin charger, perfect for my laptop case for traveling. Collapses quite a bit. Works fine on my Motorola Razr cellphone and Blackberry Curve, since both have the mini-USB connector."
3,acceptable,"item performs very well, slim size only lightens the load, but still takes up same space on the wall outlet or power strip, really could benefit from narrower design as well."
1,Does not work with Motorola Razr,"Very slick device but does not work with Motorola Razr (even though this was advertised). Therefore, I had to return it. Overall very disappointing."
2,Too big for my blackberry,I used this for my Blackberry Pearl and the usb plug was real tight. It actually made my OEM adapter too loose for my blackberry. I thought it was just my Pearl than I tried it on a curve and the same thing. So I ended up giving it to a friend who had razr and it fit fine. I bought it off Amazon for real cheap so not a real big loss.
4,Good resource,"We are a Waldorf family so we do not really do anything academic in the preschool years. I purchased this because our 3 yr old really wants to be part of our main lesson time. I have been choosing books from Peak with Books that coordinate with what the older boys are studying and using the poems, finger plays, and art activities with the little guy. This is working well and overall I think it is a great resource."
2,Not the Blocks of Balanced Literacy,"This book does align literature with skills; however the term ""Balanced Literacy"" is misleading. It is not based on language blocks: phonemic awareness, phonics, comprehension, vocabulary and fluency. It is balanced in a different way."
4,Be careful of what you read because it will change you.,"A wealthy friend of mine turned me on to this book because it summarized his thoughts on reading. Everything we read changes our outlook on life. Burke Hedges talks about how reading changed his life and how it has changed the lives of hundreds of people like: Ophra Winfrey, J.W. Marriott, Wendy's Restaurant Owner - Dave Thomas and others.Learn more about the Readers & the Read Nots Vs. The Have's & Have Nots in Chapter 5. What we read is as important as reading itself. This is a book for those who want to learn how to read and change their life."
2,The title is an empty promise.,"I'm all for reading. A reading advocate for all seasons.But this is a short book that can't even fill its short pages with any message more specific than: Reading Is Good Not Just Because Your Teacher Said So, But Because It Will Increase Your Chances Of Success In Life.Really! What a surprise!If you don't already know that, you ain't gonna be reachin' for this book in the first place.P.S. I was hoping to, and still hope to, find a book linking certain books/magazines and certain reading habits with certain successful people, so as to draw conclusions as to the best things to read and the best reading habits to have if you want to ""B"" ""E"" ""Successful"" (or at least to pretend you have a chance)."
2,Surprising inaccuracies,"SL lovers will find Meredith's book fun to read for the pictures alone. Lots of neat restored 300SL coupe & rdstrs, 190SL's and 230/250/280SL's with many nice detailed photos of obscure options, etc. I particularly liked the last chapter showing raw data from the factory about production details. Be aware that the book has numerous factual errors. For example, Meredith says that the W113/Pagoda cars had black engine compartments, including the underside of the hood/bonnet. This is WRONG. Those areas should be the same color as the exterior of the car. There are other errors as well. It is a pity that a book that is so informative and that so many people will doubtless refer to for many, many years helps to spread misinformation. Future restorers beware."
2,CAUTION: Title is misleading!,"Positives: Gorgeous photos and substantial fact-based descriptions of pre-1971 Mercedes Benz SLs.Glaring NEGATIVE: Only five sentences and no photos on the SLs from 1971 to the present (350SL, 450SL, 380SL, 500SL, 560SL, SL-class, etc.).IMHO, if it could be retitled ""Pre-1971 SLs"", it would rate five stars but, as it is, it was a near total disappointment for this '72 350SL owner."
2,"Slow reading, too many characters.","Having read and loved ""Over the Moon,"" I eagerly anticipated Linda Anderson's newest novel, ""The Secrets of Sadie Maynard."" This book disappointed me in that there was too much time spent on hillbilly characters and not enough time with Cutter and Memphis. Too much emphasis was put on the back-hills, mountain culture. I finished the book only to give it a chance till the end, but it didn't satisfy my hunger for a great story."
1,worst book ever,"I was sorry I ever picked up this book after only a few minutes of reading. By the midway point I figured nothing could redeem it, but still read on intent on seeing if the ending would make me like this story. I was sadly disapointed by the lack of brains on the part of the characters. I have never came across two characters so badly written. I will never read another book by this author again."
5,Couldn't put it down!,Great story! My husband & I read it (fought over it) at the same time. Can't wait to read more by Linda Anderson!
2,Hard to follow,"I was quite disappointed with this video. I workout on a regular basis and was hoping to add dance into my routine to change things up. However, this was not the DVD to start with.The other reviews did a good job of explaining the different sets on the DVD so I won't talk to much about those. i will say that I feel like I got the best workout from the first routine, the Latin routine, which was focused on abs. The other two didn't do much for me.But the real issue I has was not being able to keep up with the steps. I am no a dancer at all, but my sister has been dancing all her life and is in a show choir now and she had a hard time keeping up with the steps. Often times you only see the steps once before you do them at tempo. I also felt like I needed a lot more space than would be available anywhere in my home.If you want to learn the dances this may be a good DVD for you. If you are a beginner or are looking for a good workout I would suggest skipping this video."
5,Fun!,Best part of this workout is that it is fun. Isn't one of those that you can't wait until it's over. I found I was more likely to look forward to my workouts using DWTS Series. With the snacks I ate over the Holidays; it's time to dust them off and start again:)
3,Not great for beginners,"You really need to know somewhat how to dance to this.. It's very fast paced, with little instruction. I picked it up easily, but if you don't know basics, It may take you a little bit to pick it up. The 'one-on-one' instruction really does help, so that's a bonus.. Over all, i'm glad I got it on Amazon instead of paying a massive price at Target for it."
1,Not worth the money.,"Somehow the creators of this DVD managed to find BORING latin dance music! IMHO a difficult task! Other than that, reviews by Rayna, B.Glass and Justin Bailey said it all. Wish I had: 1) read these reviews before purchasing and 2)spent the $ on a few downloaded tunes instead."
3,A minor let down,"After reading the reviews others wrote, I debated returning the video. I kept and like the majority of the buyers was disappointed. I didn't think it got my heart rate up at all until Lacey's freestyle section. The latin section was mediocre, and the tango was just a bunch of walking around from each segment. I will continue to use it but definitely on my easier workout days."
2,Not the switch that I ordered!,This is the wall switch that I ordered but I was sent a different one.The switch that I received was not a dial switch. I received a push switch.
2,Great product...to bad they sent the wrong one.,"I sent for this switch because it had a twist on off switch. The one they sent was a flat toggle plate, and very easy for young children to turn on. Next time send the switch you advertise!"
2,Cheap Switch,"Product is incredibly cheap. Others have pointed out the picture doesn't represent the actual product shipped. True. But neither is the quality of actual as good as the original, which came with my fan.While I was installing it, the print on the switch was smearing. I had better remember what is high and what is low because the labels will soon be worn away.If I weren't so lazy I'd send it back and get a refund. I deserve it.But do you?"
4,The Roots of American Hillbilly Religion,"If you ever wondered where Theonomists, Christian Reconstructionists and other right wing civil-violence supporting movements came from this is a must read book. Verduin successfully seperates the wheat of peaceful Christianity from the chaff of civil-religion and demonstrates how vastly more wise step-children can be from parents. Anyone who has ever been surrounded by a person who believed they had a divine mission to govern the world will get a kick out of this book (no pun intended). A must read for religious libertarians, but be prepared to have your saints soiled. ""The Reformers and Their Stepchildren,"" reads like a horticultural digest, and Verduin, the Sunday morning tv-religion gardening expert, demonstrates that in the war between weeds and crops, you better be scared. Whether you're Christian, Jewish, Sikh or Confucian, the weeds and flowers raised in this garden are perennial. -Two Thumbs Up for the Flowers"
1,Terrible Production Quality,"I'm in a state of almost disbelief as to the poor quality of this DVD. The video is blurry, out of focus, grainy, and the worst I have ever seen on a DVD. There are numerous skips and stops, and I don't think those are due to damage to the DVD. I think that's just a part of the production quality. I've never seen anything like it, except maybe for a home-made VHS video on overly-used tape. The story, itself, was not good enough to influence me to keep watching this mess more than a half hour into it. I just shut it off and wrote it off as a bad purchase. Pew! Stinko. Worthless. I'm flabbergasted."
1,"Bad, Bad Book","What an awfull book. It is difficult to read through the choppy dialogue. The plot doesn't make any sense. Jane Seymour seemed to have forgotten that kids aren't stupid and do have imaginations. Comparing this book to Dr. Seuss is laughable. As I was reading this book to my children, my youngest said it best, ""Daddy, please! Why are you not stopping??"" Steer away from this book."
3,"Good Review, Poor Writing/Editing","This text goes over most of the key concepts of surface reactions, but the large number of typos make it hard to read."
1,Sucks,"I would LOVE to know the story behind the making of this atrocity. I do my best to steer clear of penning negative reviews because I know how difficult it is to put a movie together however, I am doing humanity a favor here. Zombie Night is perhaps the worst piece of junk I have ever seen. Let's break it down here:Acting: Sucks.Directing: Sucks.Writing: Sucks.Camera Work: Sucks.FX: Sucks.I could go on but... you get the idea.The distribution company probably needs to rethink their acquisition strategy.I hope this helps. Please don't make the same mistake I did. I will never get back the time I spend watching this trash. That is my regret."
1,Bad Acting,What is really bad is that the kids in the film acted better then the adults...If your going to make a zombie film you might want to make sure that the people you pick to act in your film know their lines. Skip it unless your trying to make your way through all the zombie films ever made.
1,"zombie night should of stayed buried,its an insult to the dead","Quoting a line from Pet Cemetary ""dead is better"" meaning that you'd rather be in a coma to get through this one.I'm a fan of zombie movies and this one elstinkso!Everything from the fight scenes,acting and production value stinks.The one female throws herself at a zombie as to say I have other things to do so get me off the set.PATHETIC!"
2,Louis Hayward Times Two,A pair of fun films presented inadequately. I know the films well and found them unwatchable. Possibly my expectations were to high. Find another source.
1,Joe Estevez should have been in Spawn.,"Ahh! Soultaker. A bad movie? Sure! But not terrible. The value of this little cinematic jewel comes forth when you see it in a group (perhaps at a party or something). Then everyone can take turns and riff the movie, the actors, the editors, the director etc. It's good clean harmless fun. Afterwards you can all play frisbee with the DVD or if you bought the VHS version you can take appart the cassette and use the tape to play jump rope."
1,HA!,"I didn't think movies could be so silly. MST3K had a hysterical version of this movie... unless you're watching with your funny friends, avoid this poor excuse for a student film."
1,Souptaker?...bustaker...leaktaker?....MST3k,"I saw this movie when it was on Mystery Science Theature 3000. This was by far, one of the worst movies they have ever watched. It was prime for comments, and great for making fun of. If you want to watch this movie, I hope your watching to make cracks at it. If your watching because you think its going to be good...you might as well put it back. This movie is horrible. The woman who plays the leading lady role in it wrote the movie as well. Hopefully she won't write anymore."
2,Godawful,"I saw this on MST3K last year and it was TERRIBLE! Cheesy late 80s music, a guy that looks like Bob Vila, and godawful acting. The scenes at the summer festival(or as Crow called it, the ""summer festering"") and the Kwik-E-Mart were just totally dumb. Especially the part where the one guy, who is visible but dead, smashes a jar of pickles on the floor to get the worker's attention. HELLO? You're DEAD!I was totally shocked to see that this was on video AND DVD. Why in the world is this on DVD?Rated 'R' and not to be sold to persons under 18, you say? IMHO, it's rated 'R' for ""retarded"" and shouldn't be sold to persons at ANY age!So, please, PLEASE only see this on MST3K(if they ever rerun this episode again before Sci-Fi's lease runs out on the show)."
1,Reality check,"It's hard to imagine why this movie made it to DVD. (Perhaps to cash in on its recent use on the TV show ""MST3K""?) No offense, but I would be hard-pressed to call this movie mildly interesting, let alone exciting. The positive reviews below sound like they all came from the producers, or perhaps more likely a joker with lots of free time on his hands.My suggestion: if you're really interested, rent before buying."
2,"Better on ""Mystery Science Theater""","A guy from the wrong side of the tracks and the mayors daughter are the only survivors of a car wreck. Or are they? Charlie Sheen's brother and the guy from the Maniac Cop movies follow the teen couple around after-hours Alabama before the teens can get their souls back into their bodies at the hospital. There is more pointless running away than in a ""Halloween"" knock-off, and the villains aren't scary, they're just a couple of dorky middle-aged guys looking for an acting job. ANY acting job. Much better when viewed ""Mike & the Bots-Style"" with plenty of insults hurled at the screen!"
2,A Good Movie? You guys are funny...,"Okay, this movie wasn't HORRIBLE, but come on. There is an unbeliable amount of stupidity in this movie. The ""Angel of Death"" had a face the size of Montana and talks like a moron. Besides that, they spend way too much running through the hospital and showing the infamous ""peeping mother"" scene. Half the time the movie revolves around the star/writer/screen writer taking her bath. Not to mention the entire thing could be predicted by a nine-year old. Face it...this is just one of those boringly bizzare Angel of Death flicks."
2,"Soultaker, comedy horror","I've seen this movie on VHS years ago, I was very average, not much action or Horror at all, the story to the movie was interesting when you read it, but the actual movie is poor, and why is it that the DVD's of this Movie are so EXPENSIVE, your paying an Equivlent for 17 DVD's worth for this movie that I think doesn't rate very well. If I've mist something and there is a reason for the expensive price, Let me know.Cheers"
4,Oddly unforgettable,"11 years passed and suddenly I remembered bits and pieces of a movie where a supernatural entity was collecting souls. I could remember a clock, an elevator and a car crash but for the life of me couldn't think of the title. So I logged onto IMDB.com and used power search and finally found what I was looking for. This film went straight to video but I PROMISE you it's worth checking out. Anyone who likes the ""race against time"" theme combined with a little humor and some cool special effects will undoubtedly find this film a keeper."
3,emilio's uncle,"c'mon! this movie is great! it stars emilio estevez' uncle. how could it not be great? it is also one of the best mike MST 3Ks. i'm sure joe et al were not serious when making this movie, and would not want any of us to take it seriously. just have fun with it!"
1,"Take my soul, please!","I saw the MST3K version of this rhinestone and can tell you it's amazing anyone financed this low grade, '80s movie-of-the-week. The young leading lady is also the ""movie's"" screenwriter; in film school she should have had her soul taken and beaten with a bat. Joe Estevez--aka Martin Sheen's brother--is about as intimidating as a bag boy at the supermarket. The ""special effects"" weren't. The storyline comes out of nowhere and leads back there, taking neither your soul nor interest. It's usually a good idea to feel some empathy for the characters, interest in the plot and surprise at the end...but this flick is woefully short on good ideas."
3,could be better,"This is a pretty cool product, but I wish it were louder. I cannot hear the other person if I am going over 30mph. The microphone doesnt work sometimes either and I have to re-power the device.Otherwise... I like using it."
4,Pairs with ZUMO,"The Cardo ScalaRider I purchased recently paired correctly with my new ZUMO 550 GPS. I have not been on the road with it yet (cold in the NE USA). The sound level seems a bit weak; I'll evaluate it with road & wind noise plus the hum of my VFR when the weather warms. It may require more careful ear speaker placement. The units battery loses charge rather quickly, so I suggest leaving it on the charger if you want to be ready to go at any time. I am also going to see if it will pair with a new bluetooth phone (Verizon FlipShot) when that arrives. I'll update when I have more info."
4,Great film,I highly enjoyed it. A good scifi film. A good film to add to your DVD or online movie collection.
3,Meh...,"This was a fun movie to watch, but too predictable to be great. I wouldn't buy this movie but I would maybe watch it again."
1,Battleship,"I wrote a low rating because the DVD I purchasedFroze up in the middle of the movie. AlthoughI purchased it used, it still should have on betterCondition. My money was refunded. But it wasStill was a bad experience."
3,Decent movie,This was a decent movie. The previews that you see for this movie pretty much sum up all the action scenes.
4,Aliens & The military,How can you go wrong with aliens & the military. Love the sci-fi genre and love the military. What better way to the the 2 in action.
4,A Fun Kick Alien Butt/Go Navy Movie,"Is it worth watching? Yes. It's fun, lot's of action and plenty of eye candy. However, don't expect a movie with a lot of depth or that makes a lot of sense. Very loosely based on the board game and I do mean loosely. It has the underdog character who starts off as a screw-up and rises to the occasion and becomes the hero. You have the cripple that has given up and then finds new reason to fight etc... You've seen it all before in films like Independence Day, but that didn't make it any less fun to watch. One thing that stood out at me was how much the film tried to be another Top Gun movie for the Navy and I'm sure the Navy was hoping for that as well, but I thought they tried too hard and fell a little short. It's not a film I would necessarily pay to see in the theaters, but as a rental flick definitely."
4,Fun movie to watch!,"It's a nice action movie, with a funny beginning and a bittersweet ending. Perhaps the acting wasn't as great as I would've liked, but the movie has good entertainment value."
2,Really disappointed,"Really disappointed. Could have been a really great movie. Fell into the trap of a stereo type ""B"" flick. It did have some nice special effects, but the story line was terrible."
4,It was good.,It was pretty good. I did miss part of it when I snoozed out a little. But I had no desire to rewind to watch what I missed.
2,Pure Hollywood Special Effects Movie,"Visually it's a stunning movie. Special events are great Plot and acting are weak. Storyline is disjointed and military tactics and protocol is non exsisted. Liam is barely in the movie (which I don't blame him for, I wouldn't want to be in the movie either). Find something better."
4,Great Friday Night Entertainment,"Plot was so so but with 2 boys in the family, the movie was a hit. High action scenes and overall pretty entertaining."
2,Disappointing,Lots of things go boom in this movie but not much else. The acting is stilted and the plot transparent. It is unfortunately just another America-saves-the-world-shoot-'em-up movie. The game is way more fun.
2,"I liked the movie, but it cut off in the middle.","I was watching the movie, then all the sudden it cut off. I waited 10 minutes and I came back."
3,Transformers on a Boat.,We really enjoy Liam Neeson movies. This movie is not great but not totally disappointing. It was worth the $3.99 for a 24 hour HD rental. Watched it twice and enjoyed it both times.
3,Blah!....With some action.,"I sat there watching this movie and was trying to stay awake. I wondered.how an alien race,that traveled hundreds of light years, could be defeated by a 70 year old battle ship!Anyway... It had some action and it kept moving right up to climax.....The two words ""THE END"". Then I went to bed!"
2,"The old battleship ""Missouri"" and some of the fine old crew are the only reason to see this.","It was great to see the wonderful old battleship, ""Missouri"" and some of the fine old Navy personnel that may have been (I think) among the crew on her. Of course, I'm also assuming that the battleship was really THE battleship and not just a clever computer-graphics creation.Anyway, the rest of the movie is terribly simple-minded twaddle, whose ""stars"" are more like amateurs in a YouTube video. The plot is a joke, and the character development is even a bigger joke. The special effects? Meh, it's 2012, and so everybody's got good special effects. But without a plausible plot, it's just an exercise in computer software. Bottom line: this movie is really just another one of those pizza-and-beer movies, best seen after you've already had quite a bit of beer so that your brain won't be expecting very much of anything."
4,Don't pay too much attention to the critics,"No, it's not great film and there are some real logical leaps but what the heck, it's a sci-fi action film based on a board game. For all that, it's a lot of fun with some great effects and an enjoyable cast."
2,Hard to believe.,Too many things in this movie just wouldn't happen - and I don't mean anything about the space invaders - do they except us to believe a floating museum would be kept armed and fueled and ready to go to battle - I don't think so.
3,IT'S OK.,"The Movie starts out slow and builds. But there is no sense of realism and the CGI is over the Top.It is fun to watch if you are bored, but on an increasing scale of 1 to 10 I would give it a 4."
2,Short Review,What a waste of Liam Neeson. He was given very little to say and nothing to do. All we get are those unknown yong actors trying to get famous dominating the entire story who are as intersting as any metalic piece of debri blown away by aliens.
2,Ok movie,movie was ok. would have rather rented from redbox. glad I didn't go to theatre to see it. would suggest people see it and make their own opinion
4,Great sci fi movie,"Even though I found out a couple of things ""too fantastic"" for the serious sci fi followers, in general this movie ended up entertaining me to the point I could not leave my chair once it started until the end. Plus is has the support of Liam Neeson."
3,Shoot shit up,"If you like the transformers movies you might like this.The action is pretty nice, but the story is lame.A plus is Brooklyn Decker. Shes nice to look at for 2 hours."
3,watched ONCE,AND NOW EXXXXTREMELY SORRY i EVER BOUGHT ITWHAT A GREAT WASTE OF TIME MONEY AND FILM AND DVDsTHIS MOVIE IS WORTHLESS
2,Not even Eric the Vampire can save this movie,"Oh boy, why did I watch this movie? I didn't think it could be as bad as the reviews said it was, but I was wrong. I was not a good movie, and the famous faces in it couldn't make up for that. I was tempted to stop it in the middle, but my husband wanted to know how it ended, so we kept it on."
2,Great effects and that's it.,"Horrible painful juvenile script filled with mistakes. Inexcusable with a budget like this. Director must have not read it before shooting or else he's illiterate. I'm amazed someone actually got paid to write this rubbish. Watch it with the sound off and spare yourself the agony of horrendous dialogue, characters so dumb they should be in kindergarten, not running a Naval vessel, and plot development that was pointless and incoherent."
3,A little better than I expected,"If you're in the mood for a blast 'em, no heavy thinking, the U.S.A. is going to miraculously overcome a formidable foe movie, then this is entertaining. I have to add that I don't listen to Rhianna's music, but she better stick to it in light of her acting in this movie. I will give big kudos to the special effects, which were better than I expected. And yes, I had a strong desire to play the game Battleship when it was over."
2,The Ship sank really fast,"I ordered the movie on instant videos, than I ordered it at the same time, after watching the movie Idecided that it is not worth collecting for future viewing."
2,Beyond Corny...No Really!,"The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because some of the special effects are pretty darn good. But be warned, this movie is the epitome of cliches, corny dialogue and bad acting. My stomach turned at least 3 times at how bad the dialogue is in this movie."
2,If I was 12.....Maybe,"I just wanted to punch the lead in the mouth! He got so may people killed cause he is a moron, and the talent they spoke of? Never seen a thread of it...On a positive note, ""some"", of the graphics were good...Should have rented this one.....Chris"
3,Surprise! I'm a better movie than you think,"I was expecting utter crap and this movie surprised me a good deal. A very decent Sci-Fi Action romp.Yes its a CGI fest with thin characters and some issues with ridiculousness. This was expected.Yes the acting is thin (but not annoyingly bad as I expected)The CGI is top-quality.Like most PG-13 movies this one could have been improved with an R rating to up the sex (Decker is smoking hot but under PG wraps), violence (its a war move duh!) and language (they are sailors, hello?)This movie makes me yearn for a true Battleship war movie though with some real need for that old-school broad-side tactical sea warfare.If you liked Cowboys and Aliens or any of the lesser comic movies (Thor, IronMan2, Captain America) you'll like this movie."
3,Just another okay action Sci-Fi Movie,This is just another typical action pack sci-fi movie. Very predictable and for the most part just held my attention to the end. I don't understand why there always has to be some sort of love interest in these movies where the time could have been used to help improve the story or just add to the movie maybe making the aliens more of force to reckoned with. Just okay and only worthy of a rental.
3,Silly fun,"Hey, it's a movie based on a game. What do you expect?Although the references to the original game were amusing."
4,Good but messed up,"The director REALLY messed up by not featuring the veterans in the awards ceremony. Good action, good premise, fun! Worth seeing for the Missouri scenes, but they really owed them a bit more kudos at the end it just petered out with a stupid marriage proposal."
3,Um,"This was an okay film, though I wouldn't watch it a second time. This one is a rental, I wouldn't buy it. I wish I didn't."
2,"Good effects, weak plot","Aliens attack, they just destroy our planet because they are aliens. Loser with no filters becomes winner overnight due to the alien invasion, boy becomes man, dates daughter of overprotective high ranking military officer who is also his boss, blah blah blah.I really, really wanted to enjoy this movie, but was constantly let down by the very predictable, very far-fetched plot. There were amusing and entertaining parts of the movie, and the effects were really impressive and reasonably believable. The movie was well produced, but in the end it was a well produced movie with good effects and a good cast who failed to deliver equally on story and character development.Two stars because I chuckled thrice and Brooklyn Decker is hot."
2,Couldn't make it through the first 15 minutes,"I imagine it gets exciting, great special effects, maybe even some character development and realism after the first 15 minutes, but that's when I turned it off. The back story of the irresponsible younger brother who gets the girl and has a love thing going on with her even as he continually embarrasses himself is just too dumb to watch. I wanted to see the big monsters and explosions, not the cliche ""love"" story that every movie of this type seems to have to squish into the plot. But I guess it sells."
3,Battleship,"Decent special effects, no character depth or development beyond the obvious. There is no explanation of why the aliens came, terrible use of good actors, the best performance was the amputee."
5,Great action flick!,My family and I loved this movie...the soundtrack is great too. A few foul words thrown in unnecessarily ... but the action is good.
1,movie stopped streaming,"i want my money back...movie was retarded, and then the streaming stopped so couldnt even finish watching it. lame"
4,Action Packed,This movie was full of action and had a good story line. I enjoyed the action. Fun to watch. I would recommend this movie to others.
1,Sucked,Sorry but I don't have any other words to describe this hunk of crap call a movie. Hollywood needs a makeover!
1,The worst movie experience to date!!,The movie itself was great.... the video quality was the worst ever.My husband was livid! It kept freezing up every 30 seconds or so.In order to watch the movie he had to wiggle the mouse to get it to play.
1,Makes me feel like joining the navy,"Makes me feel like joining the navy, and fight aliens, any type of aliens. play Battleship, eat burritos and messed couple of time just for the fun. Get the boss daughter and married her LIFE IS GOOD"
4,Cheesy but loveable,"Yes, this movie is extra cheesy in the acting and realism categories, but it totally redeemed itself for me by giving veterans from different generations the spotlight for a bit. You don't often get to see them play the true heroes that they are. I really loved that! There were also a few lines that seemed to poke a bit of fun at the movie itself and those of it's caliber, which shows that the producers didn't take themselves too seriously either. If you can, let go of keeping things real and just enjoy the movie for what it is."
4,Much better than I had been led to believe it would be.,I really enjoyed this film. It was fun and fast paced. Anyone who has served time in the Navy would absolutely love this film.
4,The preview is bogus! Neeson isn't in the action...,"Good movie, lots of special effects. Neeson wasnot in command of any of the action, he did notsay 'All of them"", to fire the weapons.That was just a sucker play, to get people to watch the movie. I was a bit disappointed he didn't take a more active part in the movie. A little like deceptive advertising. And that is against the law.I guess it would have cost to much. Maybe he is getting to old to act.Still a good movie. But, why lie about it?"
1,The same plot of Armagedon !,"Ok it has a ggod graphics bla bla bal... But, its the same plot of bruce willis Armagedon!!! The loser guy who is in love with the coronel daugther , a close fammily memeber died! and , the happy couple save the world!, and their romance got aproved ! Are there more stories in holllywoodin theses days?."
1,Pathetic Silly Unrealistic,"There was no doubt in my mind that this movie would be bad, but I rented it the very second it was available. That shows how pathetic I am. But this movie is worse. There are so many countless bad things about this movie that detailing any one or two or fifty-two of the worst of the fifty-five-hundred truly pathetic moments would be an absolutely pathetic waste of time. There is a moment or two when ACDC music pumps adrenaline into the pathetic anti-alien efforts. I type this now during one of those moments. Anyways, save your money, or better yet take your money and burn it. It will be far better spent as ash then on this trash. XOXO The King."
1,Waste of money and time!,I wasted $22 and 2 hrs of my life by going to see Battleship with my wife. I feel sorry for Liam being part of this remarkably bad movie (is he so desperate for money?).
2,Movie for Undeveloped Brain,"This is clearly a child's movie. The aliens were unrealistically vulnerable and aren't frightening in the least. The script contains no thought provoking dialogue, however, the special effects are great. If you are 14 or younger, this would be an OK show."
3,Loud and mindless action.,"A group of Navy ships encounter an alien spacecraft intent on doing bad things to the human race. It is up to surviving crew members to save the world. Loosely based on the classic board game, this action film contains the requisite noise, explosions, and fight scenes one would expect from a summer blockbuster. Don't take this one too seriously, as there are flaws in the storyline. There is certainly nothing new in this one, as it is another mindless action movie that will appeal to its target audience of young men, who will revel in the excitement and the visuals. This is a movie tailored to fans of the action-adventure genre who don't want to be challenged intellectually."
4,Battleship,Very good 4 stares Action was excellent . The store line was plausible except for the old ship outher then that is was good
3,Not bad for a movie based on a boardgame,"I rented this from Amazon Video On Demand. The movie had good looking effects, a story that kept moving along, characters that weren't very developed but you cared just enough if one of them died. Very much a summer popcorn movie, one I'd watch again if it happened to be on, but hasn't come down in price enough for me to buy on Bluray."
1,:(((((,"no comments, dont lose your money and time for this stupid movie, silly movie for silly pepole, better than this is even reading dictionary"
5,Battleship,When this movie was first advertised I said it was a movie I really wanted to see. I told a friend I wanted to see it and he said don't waste my time. I listened and didn't go to the movie to see the film. When it became available on Amazon I thought I am going to buy it and give it a try. My friend was so wrong with his advice. The movie was absolutely awesome. The special effects are great and the story was great. I will never take advice from my friend again. I loved this move and I will watch it often. I is the best movie I have watched this year.
1,LONG!,"This movie is long and boring! Did they really need an hour before anything interesting happens? This isn't exactly an epic or anything. Its suppose to be an action popcorn fest based on a board game. This movie should have been 90-100 minutes in length, not 130!!!! I was just bored, waiting for the good times to roll. Even when the movie should have ended, it just kept on going! Jump to about the 65 minute mark, and you will be good to go."
3,Wasn't as bad as I thought it would be,Entertaining sci-fi story for what it is. Sub-par acting (almost laughable at times). Special effects were awesome! (I think this is where most of the budget went ;)My wife and I were killing an afternoon at home and this is what we chose - it was o.k.
3,Battleship,"Okay, I had fun watching this film as improbable as some of the situations were.It is a typical alien invasion story, but I enjoyed blowing stuff up and kicking bad guy butt.Rihanna surprised me. I enjoyed her acting outside of the sex kitty thing her music careerseems to have her locked in. I think with some quality coaching she might have a career on screenas well as music if she wanted."
2,pretty bad,"Pretty bad. Seemed like I was watching a poor remake of Transformers. Same sound effects I think. The video was pretty stunning. The story lame, old and tired. Funny lines at times. Very disappointing overall. With Peter Berg you either get insanely awesome like ""The Kingdom"" & ""Very Bad Things"" or you get this. Not worth a view."
2,Battleship,"I watched this film not too long ago because one of my family members decided to get it. This movie is not as bad as I thought it would be but it was still bad. The first hour and a half really sucked but then the last half hour was good(I know that sounds stupid). I will do negatives and positives on the film.Negatives: 1) Stupid Looking Aliens2) Annoying Characters3) Parts That Try To Make You Laugh But Ultimately Fail4) Like 15 Slow Motion Shots(Really Director Really), Most Are Pointless To Like A Guy Walking5) A Little Slow Paced(At Least For Me)Positives: 1) Good Special Effects(It Had A 200 Million Budget)2) Decent Acting3) Liam Neeson(But For A Total of 10 Minutes)4) Good Action ScenesI would not recommend it but it is okay to watch as a first time but no more. Definitely do not buy this film unless for really cheap."
2,"Eye Candy, Bad Acting, dumb premise,","Not much of a movie, great special effects, dumb ideas, good cast, bad acting across the board by known's and old timers."
3,Better Popcorn Film Than Most Admit,"This is NOT high art. However, for a loud, obnoxious, fun film, Battleship is your movie. The acting is alright, but the WWII veterans really make the movie."
1,terrible,I'm basically just writing this to give the movie one star and hopefully save some people from such a tragic loss of time.
