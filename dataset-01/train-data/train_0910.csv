5,Fun for boys!,"My 4 year old tries to play his older brother's Nintendo Dogs game, but it is too difficult for him. This leapster game is the perfect alternative! He loves taking care of dogs and earning money to buy his pet a toy of new outfit. Very cute!"
4,Good beginning game,"My three year old started playing this game when she was still 2 1/2. It's a good beginning game. She likes to take care of the puppy and doesn't yet do the more advanced skills, but it teaches her the workings of the Leapster. My 5 1/2 year old also likes the game."
4,Good book but one bad analogy,"Dr. Sproul offers us insight and sheds light on the often neglected subject of holiness. However, his comparison of Christ with Lennie from ""Of Mice and Men"" is ironically irreverent and disturbing. Lennie kills out of fear and lack of knowledge - neither love nor holiness motivates him. Christ figures abound in American literature. What compelled RC Sproul to use this one? Otherwise, The Holiness of God reads well."
5,Holiness of God,This book follows the videos of the same name closely. It is well worth reading. R.C.Sproul gives insights into how we should view God that are timely and much needed. The book is in a very readable style and is easy to follow. Deep subject matter handled with a simplicity that makes it understandable. The vendor was prompt and the product was as advertised.
5,Dr. R.C. Sproul's Masterwork!,"I had always enjoyed the works of Dr. Sproul, and was studying the holiness of God, so naturally the book looked good to me. What I read impacted my life profoundly. Dr. Sproul approached the holiness of God in the right way, the way Isaiah did, with awe and utter disdain for man's sinfulness. Thanks to this book, I have a renewed passion for the holiness of God and I will never be the same again. Thank you, Dr. Sproul, for this wonderful and God-honouring treatment of this immense subject!"
2,"Problems with ""The Holiness of God""",Our Episcopal study group is now in the process of discussing this book. Most of us find that it presupposes stances that we do not share but it is probably a good thing to try to understand positions that we are not in agreement with. Maybe it is just too complacent for our searching minds.
5,The Holiness of God - RC Sproul,"A great book in my opinion. Reading this helps give a perspective on how easy it is for all people to ignore the great mercies God freely gives us on a moment by moment basis. Also, it help shed light on the importance of truly understanding and revering how Holy God always has been and will ever be."
4,A Holy God,I have long considered R.C. Sproul to be an excellent teacher and he does not disappoint in this book. In reviewing God's holiness it brings us to a greater sense of awe of the God we worship.
5,Great book,"I have been going through this book in a group study, and it is great. He is a great author, and he is spot on with what he says, and his illustrations are very vivid."
1,"poorly written instructions, and missing part of instruction.","This book was a disappointment. Instructions are often inaccurate, imcomplete, and sometimes just plain missing. There are several versions of this book, so don't do it as a class. One book has missing instructions, another book has different dimensions than the next. Also, her technique is often the slow tedious method, when strip-piecing would be better."
3,Not for hand piecers,"Lovely complex quilts, but not for hand piecers like me. I found that the patches were too small and the amount of templates need to be made too many."
2,Not for a beginner!,"I have this book and the companion patterns that go with it. This book is not for a beginner! I have already found errors in the instructions for the quilts. The companion pattens are misleading. The are not all the patterns to complete a quilt they are the larger patterns. It states on the front ""no copying, no tracing, no taping"", so far I have had to copy patterns, trace inner rings on to freezer paper and tape patterens together to make a larger size. I would recommed reading the insructions prior to making any quilt in this book. The quilts are gorgeous and I would love to make all of them but I am hesitant, as I have had others tell me that they have found errors in other quilts in the book also."
5,Stunning is the word!,Beautiful examples and clear directions. This book will inspire you to create your own masterpiece!
5,love love <3,"i super love this game although this tenchu is more likely for girls coz you'll play Ayame and Rin here. i felt kinda sad playing this part because i keep looking for Rikimaru but he's not here :( but all and all, this game was a lot of fun. i actually played this game three times. :)) worth it"
1,Not the best Tenchu game.,"It plays just like Tenchu 3, only harder. No Rikimaru here but you get Rin, a young female ninja who is more like Tatsumaru. Story is not exciting but you don't have to deal with the undead. No 2-player mode. Using caltrops is a must to win boss battles! There are new items and abilities to gain."
5,Easy listening at it's best!,"A must for all Kenny G fans. All the greatest hits in one CD. If you haven't heard Kenny G, then this is the one CD you shoud get. You won't be disappointed."
1,What a Thumping Bore!,"Kenny G. is to jazz what Lawrence Welk was to swing and lounge music. You may wonder why I even bother to review this album when my feelings are so overwhelmingly negative- well, I have to listen to it all day at work- so I'm entitled to this little tirade. For those of you who disagree with me and say you just want to hear something mellow and soothing- let me recommend Miles Davis's KIND OF BLUE- you'll get the feeling your after but performed with infinitely more soul and talent.There's alot of great 'relaxing' music out there but Kenny G. is just sterile pap."
1,HUH?,"...Perhaps the problem here is that the title is misleading. It should be Greatest Hit. Does nobody realize that? Good heavens, this CD IS the same song repeated over and over with slightly different names.I can't believe I wasted my money on this - I thought I'd try to give this guy a chance. What a waste of my time. Kenny G is an insult to music, and I hope deep down he's a miserable man."
1,Time To Watch South Park Again!,"Whe listening to Kenny G, you'll understand the South Park connection"
1,Putrid From Beginning To End,Most of his most popular music. I would be scared to go into an elevator or a dentist's office again.
1,Excuse Me?,"More than with any other artist, there are so many reviewers saying ""If you don't like it, don't say anything (and don't give it a bad rating)"". I feel that if you don't want bad ratings, then do not release poor music. With the Amazon reviews, people have every right to an opinion and this holds true whether or not they like the music. Since his music does not change much, neither will his reviews. As such, for this greatest hits album, I present you with exerpts of other reviews: ""one trick pony"", ""boring"", ""this is not jazz"", ""repetitive""."
1,How boring can you get?,"Kenny G is not a jazz artist, period. He's not a very good sax player, period. And this is some of the most annoying music available. Kenny G plays pretty music for pretty people who know nothing about music. Why it sells is a mystery. A complete waste of money."
3,Kenny G Should Do A Greatest Hits w Vocals,"My mother-in-law loved this CD when visiting us in Houston, so I gave it to her. She brought up a great suggestion though. ""He should do a Greatest Hits CD with all the different singers he's worked with""...i.e. Celine Delion(SP), Toni Braxton, Babyface, Smokey Robinson, etc. The vocals give relief to the sax and actually make his music more enjoyable in my opinion. Nevertheless, he's not bad but I was a little disappointed in the Greatest Hits CD, that's why my mother-in-law has it now."
3,unsure bought as gift,I was disappointed that the case was cracked when I opened the package. I just hope the cd is ok since it was bought as a gift.Unable to play scatch
2,Better than Muzak,"Nice guy but sleepy music. I know he can do better, he's amazingly talented. Must have the same disease as Michael Bolton M-O-N-E-Y."
2,Honest review,"Kenny G plays smooth stuff. Personally, my 1st CD I listened to of him was pretty good, the song Going Home impressed me. But then once I listened to more I wasn't sure if all 8 (or 9) of his songs were part of Going Home. Kenny G has average talent, if you really want a really true saxophone virtuoso, buy John Coltrane, he is the master of the jazz saxophone (w/ Charlie Parker). Kenny G IS Jazz, but he is very much more modern jazz. Listen to the Rippingtons or other groups as such, they don't improvise as much as traditional jazz. So just know Kenny G is not PURE Jazz, but he is part of it. My own personal opinion on Kenny G: His smoothness all sounds the same. Some people say he is a master at the soprano saxophone. I will admit, he is not bad, but like many say, his tuning is off and he definately is not what you call a sax master. John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, Sonny Stitt.... those are the jazz masters."
1,A Gift Package!?!,Why would you do this to your friends...or even your enemies? Buy them Chia pets instead. Their hair is much better.
3,Give this guy a break,"I can't understand why hatred towards this man must me shown through his album's review. All the bad remarks about him, I find is very improper. If u don't like his album, just spell out his album's weaknesses and not HIM. Anyway, his music is able to de-stress me after work. :-) To each his own."
1,Not Jazz,This is the worst music I have ever heard in my life. Just because you are holding a saxaphone does not make it jazz. It has no social value except for the number of eggs that have been fertilized while listening to his music.
1,Godawful - gives muzak a bad name,"How much do I hate Kenny G? Let me count the ways...Whenever I am subject to this man's music, I become really irritated. Thank goodness for noisy industrial music, bands like Einsterzende Neubauten or The Ex, which help me cleanse my ears of KG's noise pollution. It amazes me that with all of the wide variety of music out there, so many, nevertheless, turn to this. What sheep some people are."
2,"Great item, too long to ship","This item is in perfect condition as described, but it took way too long to ship the item. I didn't receive it within the dates provided and when I emailed the seller, I didn't receive a response."
1,insipid drivel,"Some people say that Kenny G's music relieves stress. I find the opposite to be true. Being subjected to that insipid drivel on the radio is a stress contributer, not a reliever.Mr. G's music (if you wish to call it that) is nothing more than scales, arpeggios, and various other ""warm-up riffs"" on the saxophone set to tacky, new-age pop type backgrounds and is completely devoid of any artistic substance whatsoever.A sad comment on the sorry state of popular music today is the fact that a no-talent charlatan like Kenny G. can get rich off of so many herd mentality people.I used to play the clarinet and saxophone when I was younger. It sure is tempting to get a hold of a horn, find a recording studio and set some scales and arpeggios to those same types of cheesy arrangements Mr. G. uses. It's a good bet that I'd make a few bucks. Hey, if Kenny G-scale can do it, then so can we."
1,"Should be called ""Kenny G's Greatest S_hits",Listen at your own risk. This CD could be hazardous to your mental health and should be avoided at all costs.
1,Not A Wonderful World,"Amazon reviewers have been giving this man's discs five stars for being relaxing, mellow, etc. As this hits album shows, there is little progress in this man's career. Also, if you listen to the sound clips, most of the titles are indistinguishable. I have heard most of this music on light rock radio and I give it the lowest possible rating, especially for its negative impact on the world of jazz. More power to him if he can make a multi-million dollar career out of re-recording Songbird over and over again. However, shame on you if you support that career."
1,HIDEOUS TRASH,"My mom listens to this garbage. And it is so baddddd! She complains about B'witched! She's as stupid as keny g is. Can you imagine a CD manufactured around a saxaphone? Perhaps I should have gaven it 4 stars because if nothing else, if you want to go to sleep, this is the best as it gets! Borrrrrring."
1,I made a poop from which this album emerged,"where do i start??...... kenny g is a horrible saxophonist and a waste of space that does not deserve to be making cd's -- every song is the same and his tone is horrible !!! If you want to hear lameass music that has no musical form or structure than feel free to buy this , but before you do check out boney james -- now thats a good sax player!!!:)"
1,what hits?,talk about a one tric pony?all the songs sound the same and the man blows the same part.please! don't call this jazz.call it ex-lax.
5,Chicago Deep House Classic,"One of the best records to make the crowd go crazy at any Chicago House Party. Played by all the great DJ's throughout it's history on the scene. Obviously, this record has been made over and over a thousand times as it is an original swing tune but this version is a sure Deep House Classic!DJ Dubie"
4,Snap has dropped the candy dance and gone underground,When welcome to tomorrow come out in 1994 trance was still a baby.After the sucess of the smash single rhythm is a dancer instead trying to repeat the single's sound.They went for more of an underground dance sound which got them some clubplay by underground and rave dj's. This album is for more ravers and people who like mellow trance.This isn't for those people who are looking for a happy producer based dance act.I myself love the track rame mostly because its an indian chant over a trance beat which is hot.As a dj i like the album because it's mellow and great to play before i spin.Also the enigma flavored track waves is a nice mellow songs.
5,"Really, Welcome to tomorrow. . .","Well, what can i say. Its Snap with one of their best albums to date. Most of the remix editions feature songs from THIS album. Even after 15 years or so.. this album still brings that smile on my face..."
2,Nothing like ORIGINAL- Mostly instrumentals,This is not the Snap you remember- Nothing like the style of -I got the Power. This has a new girl singer with a weak voice. The rapping guy is'nt even on it. Most songs are just dull instrumental techno type tracks. I would'nt really recommend this one. I rate it average at best.
4,Bits,"Released long after the group had broken up (for the first time, at least), this is a collection of songs that would later go on to appear in 'The Faust Tapes' and 'Faust IV', although it has less impact as an album due to the length and sprawling nature of most of the tracks. Cut-up into bits and moved around on 'The Faust Tapes', or arranged into relatively straightforward songs on 'IV', there isn't time for them to get stale, whereas here they just chunter on and on. That said it's still a document of barmy, unique genius, and Stereolab (for one) would be nowhere without it."
1,not enough psi....sucks,Pissed off at the fact that I thought my car would be fixed but yet it is now just a new problem. ...
1,no wiring plug and no fuel lines as shown in photo,I ordered this pump it came super fast 2 days I dropped the tank to find out the wiring plug will not fit. no wiring plug to splice it in. also no fuel lines came as shown in photo. had to go to advanced auto to finish up the job. just a great big hassel. sent the pump back to amazon for a refund. hope this helps you.
2,not practical,"well, it's good as a protective case BUT to get the player inside of the case it is really hard and the worst part is if you want to use the camara or film something, you have to take the player out of the case to do it!! so... no good!!! not practical at all"
3,aquarium hood w/ light,Item arrived with broken hood keeper on one side. Had to tape it together but it still doesn't stay open right. Light is very bright. Only one large cutout for filter cup (I need two.)I should probably have spent an extra $10 and bout one at the local petsmart.
3,Need to saw----,"The hood fits fine on the tank itself, using a standard filter. I had to C-U-T the rear section of the hood at both ends to allow for Penguin double filters AND a top mount heater. I used a saber saw to enlarge the openings on both ends as the standard break out are way too small. The light is a full spectrum light and it does show the neon fish rather well. You get what you pay for. Not a bad deal, if you know how to saw. Remember though, alter the product and void the warranty."
5,A View of the World from the Dark Side,"Excellent and compelling.I travel internationally 6 months of the year throughout the world, but even so, this book exposed a shadowy dark underbelly I was unaware of. The author's arguments are fresh, novel. believable and compelling.Anyone interested in world dynamics and the rapid pace of change that is affecting the entire planet will welcome this innovative and paradigm shifting book."
4,Engaging and thought provoking.,"Regardless of whether you agree with Chua's opinions, this book is worth reading because you will gain knowledge and insight you never had, and will think differently about the world. Contrary to some of the reviews posted here, I don't think the author takes a political stand, but tries to objectively assess the impact of democratization and free markets before a society with cultural and ethnic issues is ready for them. Well worth your time."
1,A store full of anti-Semitic canards,"Amy Chua collected facts but not once does she show a cause and effect to anything. Every case of ethnic hatred in her book assigned to globalization existed before it and sadly will exist after globalization is over. On the other hand like the rest of the modern alliance of the right and left for anti-Semitism she spreads it tick and with no shame. She maybe excused of her misinformation or avoidance of the truth because of ignorance, But then she needs to educate herself on subjects she is far from being an authority on."
2,a clever leftist,"I saw her on CSPAN and she said that her theory of 'market dominant minorities' doesn't apply the western world---that the majority in the west i.e. whites, should not be dominant, yet elsewhere in the world the dominant group should be.She sounds like another anti-white intellectual. It's not the west fault most of the world is backwards and stupid--that's how it was when westerners found those places.The world has been fighting for thousands of years--long before capitalism and democracy. That is the big hole in her thesis.The main cause is corrrupt government (or leaders) and superstitous or wacky religous belief amongst it's citizens."
3,Lets clean up our definitions and our logic.,"1. When Lincoln attempted to free the slaves: the result was great instability (ie war), and greater ethnic hatred (Yanks vs Rednecks; and blacks vs whites). The lesson: some bad consequences do not necessarily invalidate of a goal.2. If the goal is merely democracy (meaning ""majority rule"") then of course throughout history majorities have persecued minorites unspeakably for all sorts of false reasons. Shouldn't the goal be strictly limited government where rights of all individuals are protected from the majority?Dictatorships are always more stable than other forms of government. Ethnic groups have always hated each other.Should we therefore establish forms of government that pander to these ideas? Or should we educate people to change their ideas?"
2,Weakly Argued,"Having read some of Chua's other work, I expected something with more meat on it than this. World On Fire is just a loose collection of ancedotal stories that are tied together by an anti-capitalist string.File this one under: 'Acadmic sees opportunity to substitute contrainess for intelectual thought'. Disapointing."
2,World On Fire,"An interesting thesis, that is very valid, except a central conclusion (as stated in the editor review);""Western capitalism wisely implemented redistributive mechanisms to offset potential ethnic hostilities, a practice that has not accompanied the political and economic transitions in the developing world. ""is not accurate. It is not redistributive policies that have enabled western free market/democratic nations to thrive (redistribution was non-existant to minimal for much of the U.S./European histories), thus placating minorities. It is the fact that in the Western nations the thriving economic ethnic groups ARE the majority, not the minority.How to transfer this to nations where it is an ethnic minority that succeeds is unknown, but redistribution has been shown not to elevate lower classes"
1,Cool if you like racism,She brought up so much issue regarding how high and mighty her Chinese race is and how little other people are. I don't know why she still writes books or why people buy her books in the first place.
5,Excelent,"Only Paul Theroux could write ""Brave New World"" better than Huxley. (As if Huxley could write.) The basic thematic structure of ""Brave New World"" (a journey into primitive unknowns) coupled with Theroux's talent for character, description, and satire make for a fantastic novel"
4,Latino Rap needs more press,"This is a double disk of the Funky Aztecs' first two albums, Day of the Dead and Addicted. For anyone that lives in Southern California or near the Mexico border and knows Latinos, this is a must. If you Latino and haven't heard this, pick it up. They are very skilled rappers with a style very distinctly Latino, both in how they rap and the music and beats. For those tired of the same topics all the time in black and mainstream rap, this is very different. They discuss life as Latinos in the United States, have a very different attitude towards women than mainstream rap, and just have fun. Definitely get this. It's the best way to get into the Funky Aztecs, two full cds for the price of one, and its some of their best material."
5,A rare find!,"This CD, not in production anymore unfortunately, is a rare find. Tracks are varied from dance to techno to rock. Tracks include: Stabbing Westward, Save Yourself; Dylan Rhymes, Naked and Ashamed, and many more. If you can get your hands on this albulm, then keep it and enjoy it as much as many people have done so before you. A quality buy!! Definately recommended if you one to look for various sounds and a variety of music."
3,An introduction to the crafts,"Written as a textbook for vocational students a century ago, this book does a good job of explaining bookbinding and letterpress printing in a single volume. It assumes a completely equipped print shop, but there's a lot of good how-to information here."
1,Old Recordings,"Although the performances on this disc are wonderful, they were recorded between 1968 and 1975 and, thus, the sound quality is not anywhere near today's standards."
5,Great book,"I'm about half way through the book and love it. I've never read anything by Teddy, but love his style."
2,Decieving,"I've been a long time buyer of Magix products, I think they're an incredible company but do not buy this collection thinking it will work in a CD-ROM drive (like most DVD movies do). I purchased it from Magix (for twice this price) and nowhere did it say I needed a DVD-ROM to use it. J&R Music World (another great store) advertises this here as a CD-ROM Media Format, it's not. It was very disappointing seeing that I was really interested in trying this newest collection of soundpools. I never got the chance to try it so I give it 2 stars, I'm sure the content is excellent. Buy only if you have a DVD-ROM drive!"
5,PIECE OF ART,"We also ordered a set and a single red bowl from this seller and are very pleased with these well made products. The set was for gift and this one is for me. I love the finish of this bowl. It also makes a great, thoughtful gift for someone that entertains and loves to cook. Makes serving green salads or pasta salads look chic and stylish."
1,what a waste!!!,"I would definately not recommend this , its completely self indulgent. I have heard better music on a playstation game!"
2,Over and over.,"I liked this book okay only because I had to repeatedly skip sections and whole pages to move on to the next topic. Over and over it was describing why this situation was so bad. Over and over it was explained how it was in the cell. Don't get me wrong I know you have to have a description of everything to tell the story, but every other page is his anguish over what his brother did to him, why he did it, what would everyone think and how no matter what he couldn't touch a woman who did not belong to him even though he is the rightful heir and he is the one who married her. He was feeling guilty for taking his brothers would be wife but the fact that his brother was a first class creep was at times conveiniently forgotten. UGH!!!"
2,Only read this if you have nothing else.,"I'll be quick: unengaging plot with boring characters, lacked emotion between hero/heroine, suspense/tension less than thrilling, overall a book I read within a day or two and quickly forgot what it was all about. Pass on this one unless you really have nothing else to read."
4,So good.,"Ken Akamatsu, Love Hina vol. 3 (Tokyopop, 2002)And here we are-- it's time for the big test to get into Tokyo U. And is Naru the girl Kitaro made his promise to fifteen years earlier? He can't quite recall, but when she lets slip she's trying because of a promise she made as well, Kitaro's feelings get to falling all over each other as much as his feet do. Series remains strong and witty. ****"
1,"NEVER BUY FROM SHORT""S MARINE","I ordered a manual on 8-28,rec'd email same day that it had been shipped,was given a tracking # from usps.was told delivery date would be between 9-2 and 9-22. Kept checking tracking #,never was updated. On 9-22 sent an email to Short's requesting status,no response,sent another one on 9-28,no response. Finally filed claim with Amazon and they refunded my $. I would never buy anything from this company,they took my money out of account the day I ordered the manual,then did nothing! Very upset,needed the manual,now have to find somewhere else to buy it. I'm happy Amazon.com refunded my money,I hope they get rid of Shorts as one of their sellers!!"
3,traduction franaise,ce livre est tres bien j'aurai aimer savoir si il existe aussi dans la langue franaise meri à tres bientot
5,Wonderful as luncheon plates,"When we purchased some replacement Corelle in Winter Frost White last fall, we realized we really missed the luncheon sized plates of our old Corelle. After purchasing two of these as mini platters, we realized they would be the perfect addition as medium sized plates. We use them for breakfast--omletes and toast and also sandwiches. It is the plate everyone goes for. I am purchasing more to put away as back ups."
2,Thick and Stiff...,"The picture of this item seems to depict a soft and supple quilted cotton throw/blanket. What I received, although very attractive, was a thick and stiff quilt. Not something baby can snuggle up in for sure! I'm hoping after about a dozen washings with fabric softener that this thing will loosen up. I'm not too optimistic..."
4,Exactly what you'd expect from a DS-2,"I really like this little box. It gives a nice distorted sound when I want to play some of the newer rock songs. I mainly play a strat copy with real Fender pickups. This pedal doesn't muddy up the sound, just a nice clean distortion.That said, I tend to like my old Blues Driver better for most cases. The DS-2 tends to focus on the mids and highs while the BD-2 gives a little more bottom to my sound."
3,Ok band for running,I got this band when I was in Iraq and it carried my iPod well enough for comfort through weightlifting and running workouts. I give it 3 stars because the side piece with velcro that's designed to keep any excess headphone cords bundled up is very small and comes undone alot. You would think they would have added a larger or stronger piece of velcro for this piece but they didn't ask me I guess. Overall an ok addition to anyone's workout.
3,Soulmate book,It's very DEEP..............really have to take a lot of time and ponder what you're reading.. Perhaps a bit over my head.
4,This is a deep book but I really enjoyed it!!,Very deep and Scientific. Very helpful in understanding the inner drive we have for connection and union. Has a lot of helpful info. Like I said though.....he gets pretty deep.
5,great product,"My husband and I are seniors. We purchased a portable dvd player for our boat trips, a LG-great picture by the way-but had a hard time hearing the movies with the headphones we purchased. After reading the reviews, thought I'd take a chance,boy, what a difference! I'd say they are exactly as advertised-I'm so glad I bought it.Clear and Loud.Perfect"
1,Not Compatible with adapters.,Do not use this device if you use a 3.5mm to 2.5mm adapter. The standard stereo adapter used to adapt ear buds to cell phone/mp3 players. It does NOT work. Very dissapointed. I tried two types of adapters and both do not work.
3,Average,"The fact that it has batteries is a minus for using it at home. When batteries become weaker, so does the boost they provide. In my case this item lasted 3 years, but now the connection to the CD player started to become loose, so I have to get rid of it. 3 years is not a very short life for a not expensive device, yet I hoped I would last longer."
4,"Great,but be gentle with cord","I heve used one of these for over 2 years connected to a pair of Logitech z2300 powered speakers. The Logitech speakers,which are now only $90 plus shipping on Amazon,become amazingly,unbelievably powerful when the signal is boosted with a Boosteroo.This really helps when using an mp3 with low output(keep mp3 volume down to save battery,hearing and also avoid being arrested).After 2 years i have now encountered the ""bad wire"" problem others have noted,but I will still buy another one.This time I'll take care to keep the cord from being moved around all the time,maybe by taping it to the side of the the unit and adding a short extension."
2,bad connection,"I bought one a few months ago. I loved it as first, but soon a loose connection caused the sound from one speaker to cut out. By fiddling with the cord I could sometimes get it to reconnect, and once again I'd have stereo sound. But this was touch and go. I took the cord apart (as the loose connection seemed to be in the cord and near the base of the unit). I did find a damaged wire but still (for some unknown reason) I can't get the red wire to send a signal. Now I think the loose connection is in the circuit board. It was good while it lasted but seems to be poorly made."
4,Works well,"For the money, I can't complain. It certainly boosted the output the way I expected it to. There was a slight degradation in the quality when the battery starts to get low. I invested a few more dollars in a battery charger for as much as I use it."
1,This product does not work!,I received the item in a timely fashion but once I plugged my device into my laptop my volume levels went down by over 50% not up. The button to turn the device on and off pretty much had no effect on the device. I would strongly NOT recommend this device to boost your volume!
4,Boostaroo worked great,"I bought this to be able to hear movies on my tablet during air travel and to split it with my husband. It worked great, we watched 2 movies and had no problems with the batteries and could hear them fine. We did have the sound turned all the way up at times to be able to understand what people were saying but I could just have a poor quality tablet. One thing I think that could make this product better is a volume switch on the device itself. We had to constantly adjust the volume on the tablet and it would have been nice to be able to do it on the booster instead."
4,Portable amp,Product did what ists supposed to. Raised the volume level in the truck when the kids are watching a movie. Would buy again.
4,Nice band...,"First off, I am really surprised to see only 3 reviews under mine, I thought more people knew of these guys...But anyway, this CD is pretty good, and i think it is a worthy debut, though I hope their next oen will be better. This band is unique and so I like them cause I am always looking for unique bands. I like the lead vocalists voice and the guitars are nice. Plus the fact that these guys are recommended by He Is Legend (The best band I have ever heard)is a hint that you need to check these guys out. Best songs are Hospitalized, One, Two, Three, Three(or whatever that one is called, cause i dont quite remember the exact name of the song) and Venus.I really hope these guys get some more recognition becacue they deserve it."
3,Banda at his best.,"Robson Banda and the New Black Eagles sucessfully mix mbira-based rhythms with Congolese and Zimbabwean dance influences. Less soulful and haunting than their chimurenga counterpart Thomas Mapfumo, RB and the NBE's Greatest Hits provides good tunes ranging from sweet lilting guitar licks to fast-paced picking. An excellent choice for the avid Zimbabwean music fan."
4,Robson Banda and the Black Eagles,"I believe that should be the title since that was the name of his band. At least that's what I heard when I heard him live at the legendary ""Queens Hotel"" in Harare, 1988. I haven't heard this cd but am familiar with his music since 1984. I had the pleasure to own a cassette of his which I took to Malawi with me. Unfortunatley, Mr. Steven's, who ran the Cape Maclear resort took a liking to it when I let him play the cut ""Soweto"" at his resort and eventually absconded with it. This is the first time I have heard it and will buy it if only for this track but I would imagine that al the tracks are worth the purchase. Enjoy!EmersonP.S. Does anyone know where to find a copy of Mapfumo and the Blacks Unlimited--""Mr. Music"" as I think that is one of his best. I saw him a few times in Zims before all this recent madness took place. It was quite safe during the 1980s!"
4,Revelations of Subliminal Effectiveness,"This is strong, succinct support for the effectiveness of the various methods of subliminal communication. However, lob-sided in that the author believes in legislation controlling its use. In todays world (19 years after the writing of this book), we can see that laws against its use are effective against only those companies that don't have deep pockets to protect themselves.Fortunately, Eldon Taylor confirms how we can develop our own subliminal audio recordings and his new book Mind Programming gives us great tools to counter today's programming."
2,Good - while it lasts (3 months),"Bought at 6 months ago - it came with the tank as a kit. Aqueon T8 17W 24"" bulb in All-Glass hood. Turned on/off once a day, run average 6 hours max. Thought bulb had gone out (after only 3 months). Finally just bought a new one, but apparently it's not the bulb!We have our entire aquarium system on UPS (uninterpretable power supply), so it's not a household current surge/valley issue, just poor quality. Have had 8 aquariums in about 40 years, and many units outlasted the aquariums. I never even gave the quality of hood lights a thought - until now. Very disappointed.Won't be trying this brand again anytime soon. You really do get what you pay for."
3,Decent hood and light all in one,"The reason I bought this is the previous one broke. The plastic hinge mount for the front of the lid is not very durable so I'm afraid this one may not last that long either. Seems like a design flaw to me. And at $50 a pop to replace the thing, I would like it to be designed a little better than this. But all in all, I like it while it works."
4,A great product and fits perfect!,"It came promptly from Pet Solutions and was easy to get ready. I was really happy to find out it was a strip light on a hood. The light really enhances fish and color, especially if you have tetras."
2,When good ideas go bad.,"This book's concept and outline are excellent. Its bibliography shows that it was well researched, so there is no excuse why it was so poorly written. Besides this being a dissertation of the author's personal feelings and political views, there are two words that describe this work: weak and immature."
4,One wiccan man's journey along the pagan path+,"It seemed you either liked the book or you probably hated the book.Why all the praise and hissing about this book?I was somewhere in-between.I liked how he described his rituals and beliefs,yet this is not to be considered the definative pagan way of practising wicca.So,the reader must keep an open-mind ,that this is AJ Drew's take on Wicca.To name the book,'the Wicca Bible',may be a bold statement.A better title would be,'One Wiccan's Credo'.His opinions are quite strong,yet i was interested in what he had to say.The problem is not in his writings,it's with the title.A bible has a set dogma,with core beliefs and universally accepted axioms among its brethern of cult followers.I would still recommend reading it,though read it with an open-mind."
1,Horrible,"I have an extensive Wiccan library and have studied for many years, and this is the worst example of a ""Wiccan"" book that I have ever come accross.It's not Wiccan, it's A.J. Drew's personal religion.It's aweful, buy something else."
5,Warning: Rethinking Ahead!!!,"I am 17, I have been studying for 8 years, devoted for 6, and have read many books. This is by far THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ on the subject of Wicca. A.J. goes above and beyond anything I've even thought of about theories, and answered questions I didn't even know I had. I highly recommend this book."
3,I can't love or hate this book,"I have read this book twice. I plan on doing a wiccan blog on this book. Its difficult to describe how I feel about it. Judging just from the writing style, a lot of people may feel this way about all of Mr. Drew's books. I cannot say.A Wiccan Bible is a misleading title to start. For someone new to the craft, the title may suggest this is a 101 book that will lay out the general guidelines for discovery along ones path, so that you can find the right tradition for yourself or perhaps create your own. This really isn't the case. This book is a guideline for the whys of the A.J Drew path. It is a book with lots of information but in between, it is filled with the feelings and findings of Mr. Drew.I don't want to go further into this because I'm going to be doing a blog on this book. I will leave you with this though. Mr. Drew's book will make you think."
5,this is a great book for curious people and new comers.,this book does a great job on explaining wicca in a thorough but easy to understand way.
3,Blah Blah,"I found this book to be informative if you have never read any other wiccan book before, but I feel that the author rambles on and on and on. The book could have been half as thick if the author really wanted to talk straight and get the point across to the reader. I feel that this book jumped all around and stopped on certain things that had no meat to the content. Please buy this book if you want to be lost."
3,Good try by Roberto Alagna,"Based on Robert Levine's favorable recommendation, Ipdahlke's favorable recommendation, and the unfavorable recommendations of other music critics, I give this disc a balance of three worthy stars.Berlioz is super difficult to perform. He makes crazy demands on tenors' resources. Stratosperic high notes with basement bottom low notes. His Aeneas has to be three tenors in one. Reminds one of Violetta in ""La Traviata"". Aeneas must be dramatic, lyrical, tender, sensual, etc. ""Sur les monts les plus sauvages"" from ""Benvenuto Cellini"" is ridiculously difficult. The tenor must sing lyrically with a blend of anger tempered with nostalgia. He must resign himself to his fate as the Pope's artist. Nicolai Gedda has a fabulous recording of this aria on his compilation disc, ""Opera Arias: Nicolai Gedda"". It has been issued on Capitol Records and EMI."
2,What audacity!!!!!,"To record Mephistofele's Serenade, something Berlioz wrote for a BASS to sing, is pure folly. Also, why isn't the Serenade accompanied by more than one musical instrument? Where is the rest of the orchestra? Berlioz wrote the Serenade for more than one instrument!"
2,Very bad CD,"Listening to Alagna's nasal, metallic tenor voice is torture beyond belief! Avoid this CD at all costs!"
5,just a great as all richard scary's books,"My title says it all. Our children (now 45 and 42) grew up on Richard Scary, and now it's the next generation. There is never a moment of boredom; just plain fun and discovery."
1,"""Disintegrating Garbage""",BULB FAILED AT TWO YEARSBULB HOLDER PLASTIC ASSEMBLY WHICH IS ISOLATED FROM WATER BY PLASTIC SEE-THROUGH SHIELD HAS LITERALLY DISINTEGRATED AND DETACHED FROM BLACK PLASTIC STRIP COVERABSOLUTE GARBAGE...LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR DURABLE HOOD LIGHT STRIP
1,Seams ripped on the second day,"I bought these last year to bring with me on a cruise. They fit great and looked really cool. However, on the second day of wearing them, one of the seams along the outside ripped about 4 inches and the other side started to rip. Luckily I brought another bathing suit to wear. Because of the material, it doesn't look like it's possible to sew them.I thought maybe I just got a bad suit and was going to buy another, until I read that someone else had the exact same problem. It's too bad that the quality of these is so poor, because they're really nice looking."
5,This Book Is Right On Target,"In the first couple of chapters, I realize that this is not a novel of spy vs.spy, but an actual resource book that makes 100 % sense.Mr. Winkler is speaking from experience and his background denotes a lot of it. I was very impressed with his style of writing and the material he covers. If anyone wants a career in Computer Security or Information Assurance, this book is a definite MUST READ and MUST HAVE in your library."
3,Very general - fun read,"Not a lot of depth here, but still a very interesting read. Don't get this book if you are looking for a detailed analysis of the threats that can be perpetrated by people we come in contact with every day. Rather it offers a very general overview, some interesting cases and a small amount of depth. I would have personally liked to have seen much more detail in the cases."
4,How to save your company by securing your information,"Saving your information is an aspect that must be treated. This information critical to each company can determine if it continues to work or be eliminated.This book although called ""spies among us"" reflects the vulnerabilities that can harm this information.Some are human factors as international spies, and some from competitors or bored hackers. Others are weather, earth quakes or even power outage that can have the same overall affect (although may be neglected as act of god).The book is full of stories of human factors which are very interesting. It has a great check list at the end to see all kind of attacks and how to protect from them.Although not all breaches can be closed. But being prepared and not dig your head in the sand can close most of them.I recommend this book to everyone interested or working in the security world."
5,How to avoid becoming a victim,"Ira Winkler has written this book to provide the reader with a comprehensive introduction into the world of secret agents and how they circumvent security measures. If you want to understand the skills involved, you must read this book. Many of Ira's examples of real-world security incidents make the book a very enjoyable read. Especially, part two is based on multiple interesting case studies, from his penetration of a Fortune 500 company to secretly accessing buildings where nuclear reactors are designed and built. Each case study provides specific examples of the mission and its outcome, and the individual security vulnerabilities he exploited. Overall this is a very valuable read for executives, consumers, as well as novices interested in the world of security and espionage, and how to avoid becoming a victim."
2,Bench is not Red Granite in color,I was looking for the mixed reddish color of red granite. There is a small amount of red when you look at the bench in the sunlight. It looks more like a light gray granite. It is light and easy to move around - maybe a little light for outside in the garden. It is sturdy enough to sit on.
4,Not the Final Finale,"'Finale: An Easy Guide to Music Notation' is almost a misnomer. There is nothing easy about learning Finale! I am still using the book as a reference and probably will for some time to come. Finale has a lot of non-standard computer procedures and the learning curve is a bit steep, even for a seasoned musician and especially if he is new to scoring with a computer. So, the easier the better, especially to start off with. The book fit nicely into this category even though it probably was intended for a class workbook. The format was a bit wrong for private use. It was set up with exercises and lessons as opposed to straight text information. If you like to work through lessons step by step then the book is a good place to start."
5,One of the first Blue Moon books by Jennings?,"Published in 1990 under Ananymous this James Jennings book was perhaps Jening first foray into the realm of erotic spankings ....It's the old strict disciplinarian tutor meets the 'high strung' and sexual pupil ... Lennox the tutor, is hired to teach the young Elizabeth her three 'R's and of course he feels that the best way to do it would be to spank higher learning into her.Little Liz of course gets to like being man-handled... a lot .. and does everything she can to entice the young teacher knowing full well that his restraint slowly was being destroyed ....So this is definitely a masterpiece by those who love stories with erotic spanking as its theme ... and .. I give it five stars compared to other books of this genre because it does not ONLY contain over a 1000 pages of only spankings ..."
2,Terrible-impossible to set up,"I bought this receiver together with the ipod dock, thinking this would be easy and the two would work well in sync. I am not a geek, but can use basic computer, blackberry, etc and make simple fixes. But this manual is the most obtuse thing I have ever tried to delve into. It's horrible, and written for the kind of people who don't need it. The word ""ipod"" or ""dock"" never makes an appearance. Instead, it's fleetingly alluded to as ""hdd"" but not in any meaningful way. I think it's presumed that all your connections will be video. I just want to play my ipod through the stereo but the assumption is that this is so easy it doesn't bear talking about. It's seriously frustrating. My friend had to come and hook it up before and now that I've moved it it just isn't working after three days (seriously) of trying. It looks very easy. Would not recommend this to anyone not well versed in ""AV receiver speak."""
4,Great Surround Sound receiver!,"I combined this receiver with the Athena Micra 6 speaker system, and the sound is excellant for a 14'x 14' room."
3,Good machine for the money.,"As all Onkyos, this is a good amp/receiver, and should give you good service until the""next"" thing comes on the market. It does a lot. Two minor negatives though (or perhaps not so minor): it does not have HDMI input, and the speaker terminals in the back are so cramped, it will drive you bonkers, trying to connect all those wires. If you have a pianist in the famly, try and get him to do it for you."
5,Terrific buy,"The TX-SR504 receiver is typical Onkyo: good feature set, easy to set up, terrific sound, total reliability. This product and Amazon's price and service made it an incredible buy."
5,Best around for Price,This A/V receiver suits me to the ground. My TV has 3HDMI inputs so I don't need a receiver with HDMI through-put. I've got the audio from my sattelite box & PS3 (aka blue ray player) hooked up through the optical inputs through a 7.1 speaker system and it works perfectly. I can finally take advantage of the surround sound available on the movie channels.Setup is easy and the sound quality is excellent. I would definitely recommend.
4,Nice for the price,"great for the price, no hdmi and has trouble with my universal remote from comcast cable. for under $200, CAN'T BEAT IT"
3,Had to return and get Marantz SR4001,"Unfortunately, I had to return this Onkyo because it made my speakers sound just OK. I bought it based on reviews here and at Circuit City. It's highly rated, but my Monitor Audio Bronze B4 speakers sound great on my Marantz SR4001 (about $500) After hearing the speakers in the store on a Marantz SR4230 and then this TX-SR504, they sounded flat. The speakers are only $600, so I didn't think they'd be over the Onkyo's head. I used the digital audio connection, but the Marantz SR4230 only has analog and it STILL sounded way better. I will say though that the Onkyo was much better with my old SONY SS-U211 speakers than with my old NIKKO amp. Unless you're buying a more expensive receiver, it's best to hear it with YOUR speakers first. I thought I could just base it on other peoples ratings, but I got disapointed. I may have been able to just get a better Onkyo."
4,cool receiver for the money,"works great, good value, wish it had HDMI inputs but for the money it rocks"
4,Reasonable 7.1 receiver.,This is a nice receiver for the money. It automatically tracks audio input formats and displays same. It does not have a lot of power and is a little weak on the rear and side channels however it is enough for a small room.
3,Hasn't helped,I am not a math person and I have read the chapter before each class for Stats and it is confusing until the Professor explains it a different way. The equations are much harder in the text book than the ones my professor uses and it seems to have more information than we actually need to know for a basic stats course.
1,Superficial treatment of subject,"if you want to understand the theory and math behind statistics, this book is NOT for you."
4,"Decent Adapter, Squeaky Wheel","All in all, this adapter is decent, especially in the light of the other selections available in brick & mortar stores. The sound quality is pretty good. The only drawback is the inner workings will start to squeak after about a month. Cleaning the rubber part of the wheel with rubbing alcohol will take care of it for about a month."
1,Find a different one,"This style of kaleidoscope is fabulous... this particular one is just too small. I buy them for gifts all the time, but can get them larger for the same or less money elsewhere, or even on Amazon from a different dealer."
5,question???????????,Would this motor work with the team losi mini baja 1/18 rc. I noticedthat theres a third wire on it.(mine only has two wires.)please respond. Thanks!
5,My daughter's favorite toy,"I have an 18-year-old daughter with severe disabilities. She loves this toy because she is able to activate the sounds easily. She carries toys for hours and often drops them, so this toy gets extra points for not having sharp edges and excessive weight, like similar plastic electronic toys for toddlers have. This makes it a very safe toy for her."
2,From flame to fizzle,"Well, I got this CD the first time when I was in Jebal Ali and was really excited then I listened to it. I was kinda disappointed. I was expecting some of the same as ""Dreamland"". I understood his message in his songs but I wanted the beats from his first. I think Mr. Miles should stick to the Dreamland style."
4,Different Sibling...same father,"This stayed in my car CD for a couple of weeks! Always another nuance to enjoy. While definitely not the same as Dreamland, definitely the same genuius at work. (as a matter of personal taste...could have lived w/o the baby-voice backing track to track 1-3!) still... ****"
3,New Age And Jazz,"I bought this album on the strength of how much I adore ""DreamLand"". I am big into ambiant trance, and vocal trance, but this album comes off as elevator music. It does have some very soothing music, and if your into chill out buy this album. I like chill out music, but I bought this evpecting another voyage into trance, and found it to be lacking.There is some very good horn work, and I loved the tracks ""Heatwave"" and ""Maresais"". Robert miles does one thing well, and thats blend generas that normally don't work well togther. Several moments in this album have muted conversations in the background as well as babies and waves. These are all nice touches, and would have worked in very well if this was a trance album. But sadly, this one leans far towards elevator music."
3,Reality Sucks!,"Well, not really, but I perfer the world of dreams. Robert Miles does have some nice almost Jarre-esque soundscapes on this album, but it just doesn't stand out to me as Dreamland did, this being more of an ambient background music. There are also no standout tracks such as Children, Fable (Message version), and One and One. It's nice relaxation stuff nevertheless, but I perfer his earlier album."
4,Modern day classics,"If you love intrumental type music with some singing then Robert Miles is great to listen too. Found it great to listen to whilst having a bath, very relaxing. Good driving music too."
5,Simple...,"This album is about just over a decade ahead of its time. ATB's Trilogy is very similar to this album, and look at all the praise that album has received. Robert Miles NEEDS to return to this sound. I JUST bought this because of the negative reviews when it initially came out. Then by chance, thank you Pandora, I heard Full Moon. I was amazed and realized how all these years I have truly missed out on one of the greatest electronic albums put forth to date. If you liked ATB's Trilogy, you'll love this album; a sweet combination of the first and second CDs. Same level of amazing production, just a decade ahead of its time."
4,For anyone who enjoys Robert Miles,"If you've heard Robert Miles and don't have this CD, GET IT! It may be sklightly different then Dreamland if that's all you've heard, but hey the same guy made it so it's not as bad as some people may believe. If you've just heard Organik, then 23am is even better for you if you've just heard Dreamland. This ties the two CDs together so almost any Robert Miles (Cocina) fan will enjoy this."
5,It is a CD that you will play often,"Robert Miles is a very thoughtful composer who pays attention to melody, harmony, and lyrics. It is easy to just want to sit back and listen to the music and let your mind become part of it. I thought it was a great CD from start to finish!"
1,Very disappointed after dreamland,If you are looking for the same flavor as dreamland then forget about this one. R. Miles has tried something different here. It is not trance at all.
3,Have some wine with this cheese.,"I was disappointed at first, but on second listen, I thought it was a nice evolution from Dreamland. The more I listen to it, though, the more I dislike it. The combo of ambient and upbeat is nice, but the lyrics are what really turn me off. The intentions are good, but they sound very cheesy to me. ""Freedom"" especially sounds like an '80s Olympics anthem or something. PLus, I can't stand saxophones, which appear unnecessarily on this album.I would give this album fewer stars, but I happen to LOVE the song ""Full Moon."" That's now the only song on the album that I listen to.So yeah, overall, the music's pretty good, but the lyrics need some help."
3,robert miles 23am,"i have become a fan of robt. miles since his dreamland cd, enjoying his quick paced ,but not overpowering style. this cd seems to be a more laid back side of him.very enjoyable,but doesn't have the oomph of dreamland i had hoped for."
4,"Not as great as Dreamland, but still good.","This second offering by Robert Miles is another advent into techno. It's more of a trip into the land of funky dreams than Dreamland. While the CD is still greatly enjoyable, Dreamland is definately the better of the two."
3,DISAPPOINTED AFTER DREAMLAND,"After Dreamland, I'm afraid, nothing will compare. I had high hopes after reading the reviews here and elsewhere, however, after listening to it several times, there are just 3 tracks that even came close to my expectations. Dreamland will be very hard to top - even for Robert Miles."
4,Much more ambient and relaxing than Dreamland,"I personally loved dreamland. This album is pretty good as well. Robert Miles classic piano in all his songs in Dreamland are mostly absent in this album for ambient, melody-less music in some songs and replacing pianos for trumpets and a variety of other instruments. Personally, this album is too relaxing for me. But still is a good album."
2,Wilderness at Dawn,"My two biggest complaints about this book is the lack of devoted material to the slave trade and the flow of story lines. I bought the book expecting to read more from the slaves perspectives, even the ""Black Frontier"" section is not convincing in my opinion, especially given the primary sources available. Even though the book lacked black perspectives, I continued reading the material and found it very difficult to do so, largely due to the writer's style. Ted Morgan is obviously a great historian, however this book is more of a survey of the continental settlement and not for everyone."
5,The first Puccini's Masterwork,"I don't know who wrote the short introduction to this score, but it's someone who simply does not have any idea about the opera: Manon Lescaut is a true, complete, mature masterwork by a composer whose astonishing craftmanship is at the same level of his incomparable, and unanimously praised melodic gift. The Dover score is the reproduction of the most authoritative edition, and show the usual, excellent standard of all Dover scores."
3,It would be a great set if it were perfect,"I purchased this set for my nephew who had it on his Amazon wishlist. I looked at it, but not every piece. I thought it was beautiful and considered ordering a set for myself. But I did not unpack and look at every piece. Fortunately, he did.Some of the pieces did not get coated so they are not useable.I will be returning them for an exchange for a hopefully perfect set. If this was just a fluke and we get perfect stuff the next time out, I will get a set for myself. They are beautiful and well worth the money - if the whole set is manufactured properly."
5,Great for picnics or casual dining,"Fun and functional tableware. Always brings compliments and smiles. Dishwasher safe. Mix and match with additional colors, red and blue Delivery was very quick."
2,Disappointing,"I was so pleased to get this enamelware. It's pretty. It was delivered promptly. But in less than six months, it is chipped and looks old and worn out. I am sad to report this, truly disappointed."
5,Best Car Accessory,"I've been using these for at least 5 years and it has to be hands down the best thing for taking care of my car I've ever used. I leave it under my seat and it's perfect for when you get out of the car wash and need to dry your car off quick so you don't get water spots. It's also great for wiping off the inside of the car, or even washing the car at home. Seriously a great buy."
4,Not perfect for a car,"It does remove 99% of the water from your car, but a film will be left -- it is best seen on glass. It absolutely does a great job of drying the car, but you may need to follow with a microfiber towel."
4,"Works well, but not quite as magical as some reviews would have you believe.","I can say this is the best chamois I've ever used (out of only a handful). That said, I can't quite rave about it to the extent that some reviewers have; it still needs frequent ringing and takes a second pass to (nearly) dry the surface (I've been using on my car). All in all, it works well."
2,Not so impressed,"I used this on my car the other day for the first time with excitement. I ended the clean with less enthusasism:(I bought two with the hopes of using one in the house and one on the car. Will try two for the car on wash number two. Maybe that will make the job easier.Also takes a few swipes to pick up the water. Need at least a second try. I detailed the clean with a nice towel ""Meguiar's X2020 Supreme Shine Microfiber - Pack of 3"" I bought two of these and should have just bought four sets in hindsight. They work as advertised and am impressed with the results. Easy to use and no streaks.These special type of absorbents all give me difficulty and have yet to find the trick or the magic chamois or absorber. This was definately not it!"
1,Doesnt completely dry up car and it grew mold,"As a microfiber towel substitute, I thought this absorber towel would completely suck up every bit of water after rinsing the car, but it didnt. Even being mostly dry and wringing out as much water as I could from the towerl, it still left streaks of water which I had to finish drying off with a microfiber towel.Also, I followed instructions and left it a bit damp inside the plastic bottle then it grew mold all over the towel after not using it for 3 weeks. Ended up throwing it away. I was only been able to use it twice."
1,GONE,I GUESS SOMEONE WANTED IT MORE THAN I DID IT WAS GONE BEFORE I RECEIVED IT NOT YOUR FAULT.THANKSBILL MARTIN
1,Junk,"I had used this to dry my car - basically all it did was make big water beads into smaller ones...**wring out**...make the smaller beads into even smaller beads...**wring out**...make the even smaller beads into streaks... I hope you get the point. It basically just pushes water around. I'm going to try the Meguiar system to dry cars. I guess the only redeeming quality of this product is that it dries to a wavy sheet of synthetic material, which is kind of cool to look at..."
2,Another disappointed...,"Not that good. I based my purchasing decision on the great reviews here, but should have paid more attention to the one negative. Yes, it does a good job sucking up water, but it'll be completely saturated in just a few seconds, and then you're ringing the heck out of it to get the water out of it. Another couple of seconds, and it's completely soaked again, and you're ringing the heck out of it again. A real pain to be constantly ringing it out just to use it for another couple of seconds. And if you don't ring it out, it'll just streak and leave large amounts of water behind. I suppose if I had 5 or 10 of them I wouldn't be complaining, but I had money to buy 5 or 10 of these at $12 a pop, I wouldn't be washing my car myself. I'll stick with my good, clean, cotton towels to dry..."
1,"Stiff, permanently wrinkled - not happy","I had high hopes for this cloth. It came in with massive multiple wrinkles in it. OK, so lets get it wet, use it and then hang to dry. It dries stiff as a bone, and the wrinkles are still there, warping the integrity of the cloth. Does it work otherwise? Yes. Kinda drags on my granite countertops tho. Big disappointment...."
1,Disappointed,"I read some positive reviews before I purchased this drying towel, they must have tested another product. The Clean tools Drying Towel does a very very poor job of drying, the drying towel has high friction when moving it across the car making it difficult to use. A plane cotton towel does a much better job absorbing water then this useless product."
5,"Does what it says it will, many uses!!!","I initially bought one of these to dry my car... and years later (with the original one still being used to dry the car) found other uses - so now I have one to dry the dog (they are awesome for this!) and to dry the shower. I keep one in the car and after hunt training with my dog its quick to dry him. No more bringing home soggy towels to wash/dry out and if I am away training/testing for multiple days in a row I always have a way to dry dogs quickly. For the shower, dump the squeegee and just 1/2 of one of these."
5,Buy one now!!!,"I was referred to this product by a guy that details cars. I just bought a new BLACK car and as we know streaks and marks stand out on black. Not to worry anymore! I used this product right after purchase (be sure to soak it in warm water as instructed before use for a few minutes and wring it out good) and it worked much better than any chamois that I have ever used. Super absorbent and no streaks! Just wring it out as it absorbs and you will have your car sqeeky clean and streak free in no time. If it is dirty afterwards ,,,, again wash it out in warm water ,,, wring it out and store it in the container while damp. Will last a long time. Machine washable if needed .....and at this great price maybe you want a couple of them. I'm gonna buy a second one because I am SO impressed. Buy one now,,,,, you will NOT regret it. My new black Lexus looks like it did when it was delivered to me...sparkling."
4,Good for drying a washed car,"I purchased this cloth with the intent of drying my car after I have washed it. I have very hard water and when I want my car to look nice I have to dry it or I get little hard water spots all over the place.Drying my car with ""The Absorber"" does solve that problem and it does absorb quite a lot of water. It squeezes out easy and stores quite well in the container it comes in. I have used it a number of times and am generally happy with it.I should mention it is does not perfectly get every last bit of water. But it dries to the point where the residual water evaporates in a minute or so. I consider that pretty good and my goal of not having water spots is met so I'm a happy camper. I would buy another one if I needed it :)"
2,not a chamois,"don't think you are buying a substitute for a chamois. you are not.it is thick, it does not absorb as well. it is a fake chamois and fake is always a compromise.it leaves water behind. rated just ok for me. spend your money on a real chamois."
2,Little pink spots,"I have used this three times. It dries my car well. After each use I have stored it damp and rolled up in the tube, as per the manufacturer's directions. Last Saturday I got it out of the tube and it has little pink spots all over it. I think it is some kind of mold. I used it anyway and it still dries well, but I don't like handleing mold or rubbing mold on my car. I think I will go back to towels."
5,Works as should,"Glade to get a hold of this chamois, after looking around ass can find here are the leathery type that can't hold more then a cup of water and spread more water then not. These work great as exactly as I need."
5,Great,Works like a champ! The best drying chamois I have ever used! Just bought two more. Makes washing the truck a easy.
5,Great product,"A great product, After preparing them with Rainex, I use this fake chamois for wiping down the shower doors after each shower to keep glass sparkling"
1,Not Like the Real Thing,It doesn't work like a real chamois. It takes too long to absorb anything. You just end up pushing the water around and leaving water spots all over. A regular terry towel does better than the Absorber. Driving around does a better job.
5,Get One!,"At my job we transport all levels of VIP and this calls for clean, detailed vehicles at all time. We count on these to help keep our vehicles clean and dry. I bought my first ine in 1992 and used it almost weekly for 8 years. They're grest for houshold spills too. On top of that, you can just throw it in the washing machine if it get's dirty. They are great to have and the make great gifts."
5,WAY better than S.Wow,"I'd used my as-seen-on-tv shammy into the ground, and needed a replacement. I bought this version on a whim, and was REALLY impressed how much better it is than a shammy. It's rubbery, and smelled a little funny at first, but it's SO much more absorbant and really effective. I've recommended it to all my friends who want a compact super-towel."
5,Beats a chamois,"I used a real chamois for most of my car-drying life, but this beats a chamois hands down. Much easier to wring out than a chamois, and just sucks the water off the car without streaking. Very impressive. Also appears to last forever, and does not easily get stained with brake dust or road grime -- just wash it out with mild dishwashing liquid or carwash liquid soap."
4,absorbs a lot! good buy.,i cut it up in 4 pieces. im used to drying up my SUV with a quarter of the size. this one is a real absorber
2,Leaves water behind and cheaper in store,I detail cars at my work luckily not for much longer but anyways this chamois does not work that well the cheap ones i have at my work are much more effective. Overall SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! its not worth it. but get a chamois if you care about your car towels leave swirl marks but dont get this one
5,Like the Absorbers!,"I bought these to use as a bathing tool for my dogs, and they are great. Glad I bought them!"
2,"The absorber creates life! Wait, that's not good!","I've owned my absorber less than 4 weeks, but I've performed 20 washes in that time frame. The product does a fine job absorbing water, and yes, it works differently than a chamois. Sadly, the product storage is not up to my expectation. I used it a week ago and followed the packaging ""May be stored damp in tube -- so it's always ready to use (won't rot when kept wet in tube)."" and when I removed it from the tube it had dark spots of mold and mildew across it. Ew, life smells funky.I thought, ""No problem. I'll throw it in the washing machine."" It washed, but the spots did not come out. I thought, ""No problem. I'll soak it with a little bleach."" It bleached, but the spots did not come out.I'm typing this with the smell of bleach still fresh and I'm thinking, ""Really? Am I going to rub a moldy anything over the top of my car?"" And I'm pretty sure I've put too much effort into the maintenance of this product. Maybe I should complete a video review..."
4,Far Superior,Bought this because I couldn't find the old animal skin I used years ago.I found this is much better than any other drying cloth I have owned.Works great with the California Car Duster Water Blade.
2,NOT FOR DRYING YOUR CAR !,"As simple as this :-This product is not good for drying your carBut it is good for absorbing water from a bowl !It is IMPOSSIBLE to dry a car with it , it almost like polishing towel not drying at all !"
5,Best towel for drying the car,I use this towel for drying the car. You have to wet it first like a regular chamois and then it works wonders. It dries my car in about a third of the time compared to regular towels and there's no constant wringing. It leaves no water drops at all and makes glass look really clean.
1,Self important drivel,"Mr. Belmonte is really full of himself. He spent his career teaching in affluent suburban schools and now he thinks he can tell those of us in the trenches how to teach. Baloney!! He must think there are a lot of fools out there to expect others to pay $55 for such of load of tired, old (or should I say well composted?) manure. Teaching is hard enough without pompous old fools spouting the same useless drivel."
3,Great for the beginner,"If you've never had *any* programming experience, and you're dying to make some cartoon-style movies/interactive games, then this is the book for you.Having actually *had* programming experience (java, C++, visual basic, etc.) I think the program is self-explanatory enough that you really don't need the book (especially when you realize that the program is free to download from the internet, and there are literally thousands of tutorials on the internet for free as well)."
1,Useless disk,"This product arrived in fine condition--except for the included CD-Rom. This Cd was packaged in what appeared to be an un-opened container, yet it had mild marks on it, fingerprints, and when I loaded it into the drive of my computer, my Mac told me it was a blank DVD. I feel like I've been scammed. Since the instruction in the book requires you to load some objects from the disk, the book is not very usable. I can download Alice from the 'net, although the current version is one later than this text."
4,Great service but misread item,"I got the books quickly and in good shape. However, I did not see the Brief Edition explanation. The brief only has 5 of the 10 chapters. If I had seen this I would have ordered the full version."
3,Good for Students - Not So Good for Casual Use,"If you're already teaching or taking a course in Alice, you'll at least need access to this book. Being by the developers and also first to market - it is the standard text. As a text, it's also very good - but also focused on teaching programming principles, not doing animations.If you've never heard of Alice or just have a general interest in it's capabilities, I'd suggest you download the program from the web first (it's free from CMU) and see what you think of it. If it interests you and seems to fit your needs (note you can't output standard video files such as .mov and/or .avi and the .html output is buggy), then invest in one of the texts."
3,Alice manual still has me in Wonderland.,"This bok was highly recommended for students learning to program with Alice. The Alice program is supposed to be adaptable for all ages but I would have to really adapt the info in this book to pass it along to my middle schoolers.I am finding it somewhat useful for mysel but I found it a bit tedious at the beginning and would like to see somewhere a more concise, better diagramed version."
3,Useless ... for a basic programmer,"If you are not new to programming, this book is useless. Otherwise, it's semi-useful. I say semi because Alice is simple, and the software comes with built-in tutorials, which is easier to follow than the book. The book does have more details though."
4,Teaches you programming concepts,"This is a pretty good book and it explains the concepts of computer programming very well. I highly recommend it to those those interested in learning computer programming on their own time. After reading this book, go take a course or a book on a real, practical language like C++ or java."
5,A revolutionary and inspiring book,"A reader from the Netherlands is deeply impressed by a book written by a woman who has tremendous courage. Jan Willis overcame racism in a way that can teach us all a lesson: try to use peace, not violence, to live in a world that seems so much against you. This book is a must for everyone who is taken by the issue of race. Jan Willis takes us on her journey from Alabama to India and Nepal, she becomes a professor of Buddhism in spite of all the hindrances she met, but even more,she is an African American Buddhist with two feet on the ground."
5,A true spiritual inspiration!,"This book is pure joy! I was inspired from start to finish. She passionately shares her joys and sorrows to 'enlighten' and uplift us. If she can overcome such pain and frustration, then so can the rest of us!"
2,A little contrived,"Overall it's really well played, what less could you expect from masters like Christian McBride or Ray Parker Jr.? Also, needless to say, Crawford's voice is technically perfect and Sample's keyboards soulful as ever. But, apart from a few songs like ""sea line woman"" or ""last night at danceland"" the end result is somehow deficient in terms of inspiration. Generally, I'm afraid, the album sounds a little contrived, reminding me of ""Morph the Cat"" by Donald Fagen, in the sense that it tries to hard and ultimately fails to recreate the magic of the early albums. I find the Crusaders' albums lovely not for their musical virtuosity but, rather, for their unbeatable charm, a quality that seems to be lacking here. Who knows, maybe it's that the plasticized 00's fail to provide the right mood.P.s. Thinking again about it, it probably deserves 3 stars but unfortunately I can't go back and edit my rating."
5,#9 on Billboard's JAZZ chart after 11 weeks,05/10/07Forget the 'b.s.' reviews here.Who are these people who review this masterpiece negatively?This album contains the MAGIC....oopsI forgot the period
1,Don't know yet?,Why is this CD so much? I'm waiting for the price to drop before I drop my dollars for this one if you know what I mean what's going on with the record company's. The review sound great but the price so high?.
3,"Feeling Good by Randy Crawford, Joe Sample","It's a good CD, very mellow music. At times, alittle too mellow.I really like Joe Sample. Together, I'm not so sure."
3,A heavy listing,"A very heavy book. The publisher should reduce the paper stock weight. After all, there are only B&W photos here. The index ends with ""S"". Also, the index headings are the same type weight as the sub-entries so you can't find anything readily. Bold type for the heading would have helped. Some Nikon items are indeed missing although they have been available for years. I also noted errors in the text descriptions of several items."
1,WHAT KIND OF AUTO SAFETY KIT DOESNT HAVE JUMPER CABLES?!,"Yes, no cables. Also, contents described on cover/inventory do not match what is provided.For the record im currently stranded with a dead battery, so you bet im salty."
2,Don't trust the picture or the description!,"As other reviewers have said, the description and pictures are misleading! Unfortunately for me, these reviews didn't go up until after I put in my order! I am very upset. This is the first time I've ever bought something from Amazon and been so misled. And for those that may not have read the other reviews, there is no hand chargeable flashlight or waterproof matches. Matches were replaced by ONE candle due to alleged shipping restrictions. How am I supposed light any of the candles WITHOUT matches?! Also, it is now a 65-piece kit. I don't know how it compares to the 63-piece kit, but I doubt the 2 extra pieces are anything more significant than bandages. One final thing is that there is a August 2010 expiration date listed on the front of the bag. I haven't checked to see which item expires, but it probably refers to a minor first aid item."
3,Misleading description,"Useful item, misleading description. I actually used this last weekend when I unexpectedly had to put chains on my tires and was without a hat and mittens, so I am glad I had it. However, the item description lists ""1 hand-charged dual LED flashlight"" which is not the case. I got a normal, incandescent flashlight with two batteries. No LED, no hand-charge. Also, the item description lists ""strobe light"" which also appears to be absent, unless you repeatedly turn the flashlight on and off by yourself. Finally, no matches as the description says. Apparently shipping regulations restrict the shipping of matches.These items really need to be fixed in the description."
2,Not worth it,I got one of the other AAA kit's and figured that the severe weather one would be a good addition considering I live in Chicago and every so often we have severe weather. I read the reviews and people raved about the little shovel...ummm why? Either I didn't get the same one they did or I got a defective one because I couldn't use it. Three people couldn't use it. I actually threw it out it was that much of a waste (the shovel not the kit).Any of the other AAA car kits are just as good and have everything if not more that this one does.
3,No Jumper Cables,"Seems like a kit of this price would come with a set of jumper cables, little disappointing. This items it did come with seem like decent quality."
2,ok,"Kit consists mostly ofbandaids in a zipper pouch. Other items seem to be mostly made of cheap plastic, except shovel."
5,Great to have.,Living in the northern area of the country will want you to have this. It contains all the things one needs in an emergency.
3,Not bad,"It does everything it says, which makes me happy. Unfortunately the screen they chose has the wrong refresh rate for the Wii, so what you get are lines running down the screen. Kind of distracting, but otherwise a good product."
5,Beware Imperialist Running Dogs!,"A book that begs us to call into serious question the nature of the society in which we, live. Using examples from postwar Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, it presents the broader issue, of ""how our system really works"": Government, media, and such."
2,Too many rules and pieces even for a regular strategy game player,"My husband and I play a lot of strategy games, from Settlers to Powergrid to Forbidden Island, etc. I bought this game because it was relatively cheap and I was trying to expand our collection. It turned out to have far too many pieces and rules for game play. It took awhile to learn and play and by the end we were all just tired of playing. It might be more fun on future game plays, but only if we didn't play with anyone new.I'd say the game is OK for the price, but not one I'd necessarily recommend to others."
2,See the vids - coming soon,"First playing with wife, neither of us liked it.Not only does it lack in historical accuracy/flavor,but it seems to rely on the euro idea of complexity -just give lots and lots of decisions - whether they makesense in the context - and this somehow makes a game 'interesting'.Anyhow, as with many games, I'll be putting a video introduction, playthrough,and review all on my youtube site."
2,It was a fun gift,I got this for a friend as a gift and though it was fun...the screen was a bit hard to read.
5,"her best dance song since ""in love with love""",this is an excellent song to dance to. if you like debbie..you need to own this song.
5,Great,"I am actualy a producer of trance music and when I was starting off making trance this is one of the cd's that I learned a lot from... So I recomend this to anyone who is into making trance... Now for those who just want to listen and not learn, this cd is still for you. It's not DJ mixed together so you can hear the final breakdowns of the song which are just as exciting as the other parts of thei song. When they are DJ mixed together you dont get to hear how the end was meant to be... It's packed full of great songs like 9 PM (til I come) by ATB and Ruhe by schiller... My personal favorites are 9pm and Tune both by ATB. So just buy it! It's not that much $ and it's totaly worth it."
5,My love affair with trance.,"Ok, so I'm not a usual techy. I was a metal head until last night, when my friend Jared lent my this cd (Which I now plan on buying ASAP) and the minute I listened to ""Ready to flow"" by ATB I was hooked. Like I said, I don't listen to a lot of techno, but now I will. I recommend this cd to anyone at all, in general. It's just that good."
3,More experimental than what most fans expect.,"This album not only sounded very different from anything else he put out, but also was his last release. For the most part, the songs have a bit of a hip-hop feel and on the title track, he actually raps. There were a handful of really good tunes on this album, but there were some that were indeed not that inspirational. Not a bad stop but not that great either."
2,Not the normal Hiram material,"Sorry folks...this is not the best CD to buy if you're used to or looking for the Hiram funk and groove. Not sure where he was going with this one. The playing as always is top notch but the material is just plain bad and uninspired.Try getting ""Way Kool"" or ""Color Me"" for a better idea of what this great artist can do."
4,French Literature in Context,"The book is very interesting and very well written. It is composed of individual articles and essays rather than chapters, which makes it very refreshing. In this book, French Literature is placed in its historical, political, social, and philosophical context. This approach allows the reader to make more sense of the authors as well the texts. Literature is also viewed in the context of other artistic manifestations as well as in its different media. The only downside that I found is that, since the book does not aim to be exhaustive, some authors do not seem to find their place in it, Duras and Yourcenar for example."
5,Indispensible,"I offer this review to move the needle. This book deserves more than one rating of four stars. I've relied on it for years. It provides studied insights into major works and illuminates so much more than does the Cambridge series, which reads like a listing. Some of the essays irritate me as much as some of the voices I heard as a grad student in French literature...driven by ideology. But others are focused and worthwhile for setting the pieces within their historical and philosophical contexts."
5,Great purchase.,This is an excellent book and superb reference. It shipped quickly and without any issues. I would recommend this purchase to others.
5,I can't hear my roomate snore!,"My roomate is a really nice person, but she is very loud when she sleeps. I use these earplugs to help myself get to sleep, and they work wonderfully."
4,Rather wordy,"As happens in many series-type stories, the author gets word-ier each book, spending excessive time developing characters and situations to the detriment of covering the action, action being why most of us buy books. This is an adventure series which just happens to use the alternate universe/history theme to generate an engaging story. The Galileo Affair tells a good story but the action occupies probably less than 25% (my estimate) of the book. I, as have other reviewers, had some trouble keeping interested enough in the ancillary info to keep myself from skipping sections to try to get to the action and find out ""what happened"". Fortunately, if one gets the book used or heavily discounted, it is still worth the effort."
2,Wow,"Definitely not up to par with the rest of the series. While it took me about two days to read each of the other books, this one took me two months. Some days, I coudln't bear to read more than one page. ICK."
4,The 1632-vers at its best,"With an average of three stars the novel is underrated. Andrew Dennis tells a good story, he tells it well and he has a strong cast of characters. Be assured ""The Galileo Affair"" bears no resemblance to filler novels like ""The Bavarian Crisis"". 4 Stars!"
3,Not another loose end!,"The book 1633 left the reader with all too many loose ends. Let's see, there are people stranded in Scotland, the Tower of London, the Dutch Republic, and of course the USE emperor is trapped in a city under siege. What with all this going on the collection of stories from The Ring of Fire leaves us with yet another situation in Bohemia! Come on, do we really need to open another front in Italy before we close out some of the others. It looks like the year 1634 is going to drag out for several years worth of books.Other than my rant about the order of things, the plot was good and featured an expansion of characters that had been largely ignored prior to this point. I would have left this book for later in the series had I been the publisher."
1,Boring beyond belief,"I read the other books in this series and loved them, this one I could have passed on and have been happy doing so. 2 short action sequences, and a lot of blah blah blah. What I loved about this series was what the tech of the future could do in the past. I loved the use of vehicles and weapons in the first 2 books. But other than the mention of radio and some future drugs and such, nothing was interesting to me.I want action and always got what I wanted from Eric Flint, maybe he should rethink his paring with Andrew Dennis."
4,Nice Job!,"It's an interesting and entertaining romp, with fun characters and good action.If there's a problem, it's the same one I have with the whole series: the downtime characters are too 21st-century. And they have too much of a tendency to read a Grantville history book, or talk to a Grantviller, slap their foreheads and proclaim: ""How could I have been so blind!"" as they abandon or modify their beliefs. It's the same fault that L. Neil Smith's work has, although not to the same annoying degree.People in the past were _different_. By our standards, they were mostly villains and thugs, and they really _believed_ in the things that made them burn witches and heretics."
2,an affair to forget,the third novel in the series it is by far the least cohesive and boring of the three. The plots were rather thin and the dialogue rather weary. I ended up flipping through pages of the book which is never a good sign. Very disappointing after the very entertaining first 2 books in the series.There were some very funny parts (which is why I am not giving it a 1 star) but I expected more from this book.A rental if you have the time. A pass if you were going to purchase the book
3,A disappointing book,"The authors have developed their characters well and the dialogue has some interesting sequences. However, compared to the earlier stories in the series, the main plot isn't strong enough to carry everything in a smooth and compelling way.Developing Venice as a industrial/commercial partner sounds good on the surface, but the distance and political divisions separating Venice and Grantville make direct trade virtually impossible.Given what historians have written about the Counter Reformation era, I have trouble envisioning any pope of that period being as willing to make changes as the pope in the novel was.I'm hoping that the upcoming novel on the Baltic War and the one about getting the Americans home from England will have stronger plots."
2,Good book if you love political history,"I loved 1632 -- an interesting premise, good characters, lots of action and excellent plot. I also enjoyed 1633 but the focus of the series began to shift in this book from a quick-paced storyline to political discourse. In 1634, there is precious little plot and too much politics. I am a historian by profession, but not a political historian ... and this bored me to death. I gave up part-way through."
5,Third book,"Though I'm not done with this book yet, it has had a good start. My dad read it before me and loved it. This is a must have if you have read 1632 and 1633. If you have not, buy all three!"
2,Disappointment,"Where do I start? This is really hard for me because I like Eric Flint He is one of my favorite authors, but this book really misses the mark. I found the book to be very boring and tedious, it's filled with pages of useless dialogue. Usually I stay up late into the night reading his books, with this I found it difficult to pick up and continue to read. With sadness I finally gave up at around page 450, it just became too tedious to read. In his afterword he comments that he enjoys collaborating because it helps prevent the series from sliding into a rut. Well he doesn't have to worry about it with this book because this missed the rut and fell off the cliff."
1,A Book too Far,"I started out with great hopes for this book, got to page 200 and nothing had happened. And it's not as if it's a thousand pages. The plot was based around a diplomatic mission, but they hadn't even been any diplomacy to speak of, let alone any technology transfer or fighting, and if we are honest that's what we're here for.All there was were various explanations, mostly of theology, but some of the diplomatic situation. I have read nonfiction books about early modern diplomacy that were less boring. I haven't finished it I doubt I ever will. Why on earth does everything have to be a series, when people seem to run out of ideas quite early on? Better to move on to something different where the ideas are fresh. Bad book."
5,Fun read,"I found this book to be very interesting and funny, a worthy addition to the series. I was rooting for the people in the story and want to see how they do in the future."
3,Staying away from Anime Works,"I looked forward to this product for a long time. The release date kept getting pushed back and I almost canceled my order. When I finally received the product, the inside of the case was broken so that none of the discs are held in place and just float around inside the case. Due to this, all of the discs are scratched by the broken parts of the case and skip in places.That said, it's still the same show I remember watching in junior high and it brings back a lot of good memories for me.I wouldn't count on the second season ever being re-released any time soon, especially not by this company, which is a shame."
4,"Good, but the DVD case is a bit small...","I really liked the DVD set itself, worked well and did not have a issue with it, however i cannot say the same with the DVDs case, its really compacted unlike the anime legends gundam wing one(even though they were in the same case, they were separated which made the possible damage to the CD less.)The best tip i can give is after you buy this, stick em in another disk case each. ;)"
5,"Great Series, definitely a Legend","This is an intellectual anime series with plenty of authentic emotional scenes to back it up as well as a few humorous seguences, all in all I'll give it:9/10 for plot and pacing10/10 for music and sound effects10/10 for characters9.5/10 overall"
5,One of the best anime out there!,"A rare combination. A great storyline that also combines giant mechs, action, and strategy to create an amazing anime that keeps you on the edge of your seat each episode. I loved this from the very first episode and still enjoy watching this any moment I can."
5,A must watch for all new and current anime fans,"Combining sci-fi and supernatural with tension and action, Code Geass is one of the best animes to date. The characters are deep as is the story and setting. With mechas fighting in ruined cities and the growing tension as Lelouch Lamperouge brings down an empire, you will beg to see more as you grip the edge of your seat."
5,One of the best animes out there!,"This show is an absolute masterpiece. By the end of this first season I was blown away! This show has everything, action, drama, sabotage, romance, strategy, just about everything. This show does have a ""gundam"" element to it as well. This anime is in my top 3! This season has a total of 25 episodes, containing 6 disks. The box set also includes extra picture dramas that give more plot to the story. It also has clean openings/endings, commentaries and the ability to switch to the original japanese voice actors. I highly praise this anime for it's soundtrack as well. It is a perfect fit to every scene in this show. The anime is cleanly drawn and unique. I highly recommend this show to any anime fan."
1,Broken in months,"In less than a year after I purchased the unit, the plastic part which keeps the CD cover closed is broken. Can't return it since it is out of warranty..... Should have bought a Sony unit, better sound quality...and cheaper....sigh."
3,OK at higher volume levels,"I bought the Mi1111 for use at my office. I sit near two other coworkers so I have to keep the volume down relatively low. This is a big setback for this unit since the amplifier hiss is very annoying at low volume levels. I had read in other reviews that this was a problem with the Mi1111 but had to see for myself. The other thing was that the demo unit at Target didn't have the hiss! I'm not sure how they had it hooked up though.My other issue with this unit, although not a big deal to me, was that the clock only displayed when you weren't listening to anything. If you had your iPod on, the readout just said ""iPod"". Not good if you need a clock on your desk.All in all, if you'll be able to keep the volume up somewhat and don't really care about the clock, I think this would be a good purchase, otherwise, move on to something else. I'm getting the Crosley CR221."
1,CAUTION: IPOD incompatibility; lousy memorex customer service,"Bought this for my son for Christmas. Worked fine with his 3rd generation nano for a while, then didn't. The help from MEMOREX? Nothing. It's simply incompatible, they say, not defective, even though it worked for 3 months then died. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
4,a parade of candidates for wildest on earth,"This book has close to the finest collection of animal paintings I've seen. It also has the best short (about six page) history of life on earth I've seen. It's great for reading to kids, being a light romp through nature's greatest absurdities, explained in a way to keep everybody entertained. And my nomination for wildest creature is--the Wolftrap seadevil!"
4,The Spetznaz Would Be Proud,"Another excellently detailed figure by 21st Century Toy Co. The detail is astounding right down to the bayonet clipping onto the barrel of his SDV Dragunov rifle. This is more for the grown up kid rather than little Timmy in the sandbox even though it can stand up to it. There are plenty of small detailed parts to loose, but that adds to it's apeal in a display case."
4,Great little machine,"I've had this machine for probably 6 or 7 years now, and it is still holding up. It's great because it's compact, but does the job. The only drawback is that you should expect to replace the cable (the part that actually makes it operate) VERY frequently. The part isn't expensive, but expect to order lots of them from the company, because they wear out in no time flat, and the greater resistance you have set on the machine (and thus the better workout you'll get), the faster they'll wear out."
1,Not so happy...,"When i bought this product it came missing a screw, I bought one of the same size to replace it from the hardware store. The screw was part of the holder for the weights on the side (which is still in tact). The pole wobbles as you step, no matter how tight the screws are (there are 8 total, 4 at each direction on the base and 4 at each direction in the middle holding the poles together). The pulley system under the steps, slips regularly if you don't have a consistent stepping motion. And last but not least the wire for the step counter was exposed because there was no way to hide it with the way the designed it, so it was easily pulled out of the back by a child. I'm disappointed in this product it really looked like it might actually be worth it."
5,I LOVE THIS STEPPER!,"I actually brought this stepper years ago and absoulutley love it! It is compact and not combersome. I absoultely love the twister too. It slims your waist. I roomated with a friend and left the stepper part behind.DONT YOU KNOW SHE THREW IT OUT! I still have the twister plate and use it, by holding on to the wall, but its not the same. and i have been trying to replace it since. I will be getting this again!"
2,Some real drawbacks but some good points too,"I just bought this product and it is sturdy and cheap. But there is not instruction manual on how to use the buttons or explain that stupid twist plate. What is it for, I can twist without it. Anyway, 10 mins after using the machine I got a severe knee injury. I didnt have an injury before using it but I got one now. I am going to have to get rid of it."
2,Kind of sucky,"The locket doesn't close and the stone falls out. Very disapointed in it. If it worked correctly then it would be a cute piece to wear, but I'll have to solder it shut if I want to wear it. Blah."
3,Resort Development Handbook,Please display at least the contents of this book so that it is easier for me to comment or make a decision to purchase!
1,Worst Nonfiction Attempt Ever,"This may well be the most badly-written book I've ever read. I understand the writer is an experienced fiction writer; I hope that her fiction is better than her attempt at nonfiction. I consider my purchase of this book as this money wasted, and I don't believe I will be able to finish it. The only thing that makes me give this book one star is that it does have some references that I might check out as readable on their own."
3,"Forget the forest, just enjoy the trees...","I would have to agree that the quality of the writing in this book is poor. BUT the author has tons of detailed information about this time period at her fingertips. I have found the side-bars especially enjoyable. If this is a period you have any interest in, there is bound to something in this book you didn't already know and will enjoy finding out about."
2,Gave up half way through,"I have recently read several biographies of famous/infamous British women, from Nell Gwynn to Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire. Due to my great interest in the Regency period, I ordered ""My Lady Scandalous"". I'm sorry to say I cannot recommend this book.There was much more content about Grace Dalrymple's family and the Regency period than there ever was about Grace, and the information was very helter-skelter. The book seemed to be mostly ""sidebar"" articles about topics the author had researched, like condoms, hot air balloons, and so forth.I took it along on a trip and left it behind, unfinished. I hope the author is blessed with a better editor, in future."
4,Grace,"A very interesting read, though my biggest problem was the presentation. little insets that were explaining something referenced in the text sometimes got in the way of the story of Grace's amazing life. At times I felt some things were glossed over, and I wanted to know more. It prompted me to get a copy of her journal to know more. A very good reference to the era. Recommended"
2,Good subject spoiled by messy layout,"I was looking forward to reading about this intriguing courtesan. However, my first impression on opening the book was of a mish mash of different information blocks inserted among the main text. I found this so offputting. To concentrate I found I had to read the book twice - once to navigate through the blocks (and sometimes whole pages) to concentrate solely on the text then secondly to read the information blocks - some of which I found were totally unnecessary and in my opinion only there to pad out the book! The flippant way it is written does not appeal either. The information was at times suspect too. For instance,I know that the family details of one of the main subjects - that of George James,Earl Cholmondeley was totally wrong. She has researched the wrong family. In 1791,Earl Cholmondeley married Georgiana Charlotte Bertie, younger daughter of 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven,his only wife, not three as suggested here. What a disappointment."
1,Poor Writing,This book has little to do with the woman in the title. The writing style reminds me of sixties free flow writing that people did after they were stoned. The author dashes off on one tangent after another that is difficult to follow and you forget what the chapter was supposed to be about to begin with. Not even worth checking out of the library much less owning.
4,Not the greatest biography of all time...,"But, it was an enjoyable read that had me laughing out loud on more than one occaision. It's definitely packed with lots of information that you'd never read in a ""proper"" history book.It was exhaustively and lovingly researched and, contrary to an earlier review, I could definitely see how current events and social mores could easily be connected to the wild times of Daly the Tall.I passed this one on to my dear friend MarJane who has informed me that should she get reincarnated, she wants to come back as a Courtesan just like Grace! She could definitely do worse and come back as Savonarola...Hmmmm....now THAT would have been an interesting meeting - Grace and Savonarola...how the world could have turned out differently..."
1,Tabloid reading in hardcover,"Gossipy, slangy, and chatty would best describe Jo Manning's style and content. Personally, I find it hard to take a biography seriously when the writer refers to a historical figure (Queen Charlotte, wife of George III) as a ""real bow-wow"". Ms. Manning finds time and space to speculate on the Camilla/Charles relationship, though how this is pertinent to the life or times of Grace Dalrymple Elliot is beyond me. She also speculates on Prince Harry's following in the footsteps of his sexually promiscuous ancestor, George IV. This is not what I am looking for in a biography. This is more what I would expect from Jerry Springer . . ."
5,Stott Fitness Circle,This DVD takes you to the next level of the Magic Circle. It is challenging and takes you to the next level after you have mastered pilates mat work. You cannot go wrong with any Stott DVD's. Educational for both the instructors and the general population.
5,Excellent instructor,"This is a rather short but effective 40-minute workout. The instructor is excellent and has a very calm, soothing voice and manner. I had not done Pilates for several years and enjoyed trying it again; the Fitness Circle is an interesting adjunct to the exercises. This video is suitable for beginners and intermediates."
1,"DON""T BUY THS","I thought this would be a good video for intermediate. It is for beginners and she talks, A LOT, it is very slow and you waste time while she talks about herself. When you get to the excerises they aren't that advanced, so I didn't get a work out. If you have never done Pilates, then go it, otherwise don't bother."
1,Calypso colander,The product was not even on the bottom. It would not sit flat and would wobble when placed on a flat surface.
2,Smaller than expected,"I guess I should have done more research before ordering this. It arrived and it's like play size. Definitely not worth the price, and not big enough to really do to much with. Other than the size though, it's made pretty tough."
5,Unexpectedly Great Product,"This blender is perfect if you want to make protein shakes, smoothies, salsa, etc. I didn't expect much out of this due to the low cost but now I use it several times a day instead of my very expensive full sized blender."
3,"Blender works, but watch out for the gasket","The blender works nicely if you follow directions not to run it too long (motor will start smelling and eventually burn out) but the rubber gasket is what I had issues with. The instructions ACTUALLY SAY you don't have to remove it to wash the container, so I followed instructions. Then two weeks later, out of curiosity, I DID remove the rubber seal and YUCK - found lots of nasty crud underneath it. GROSS. Unfortunately, once I removed the seal to wash it, it never returned to its original place in the container, and lo and behold, got caught up in the motor one day during a smoothie cycle. That was the end of that. Good luck getting a replacement gasket. Otherwise, the blender crushed ice well and made great smoothies, but because of the yucky gasket issue, I can only give this product a 3."
1,A disappointing EP from a consistently great band.,"This four song EP really goes nowhere. The version of quark, strangeness and charm is a slower version much like the one found on the business trip live cd. Why they decided to rerecord it slower and more raggae-ish is beyond me. The original version is far superior. The EP also carries 2 versions of Uncle Sam's on Mars. Again, both inferior to the original. Problem with these mixes is the vocal track is buried and the remixes are both unremarkable. At least they should of added the original version for people to compare and enjoy the social satire of the lyrics. The other track on this EP is Black Sun. It starts out promising enough but goes on and on leading to nowhere. Even the artwork on the cover does not do anything. Skip this EP. The only thing it does is remind me how great Robert Calvert was as a songwriter and singer. May he rest in peace."
4,okay food...,My dogs don't RUN to this food or get exited about it...yet it makes a healthy stool.Science diet is a good product.I like Royal Canin too so I mix the two together...
3,5 month old puppy,She loved it for a couple of days then wouldn't eat it. She seemed extra gassy from it as well.
5,This book makes med calculations very easy to understand,This book makes med calculations very easy to understand. Before I worked through Nursing Math Simplified I really was discouraged. The author actually took my call and helped me through some med problems. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for nursing math help.
3,Good soundtrack for background noise,"While the movie forPathfinder: Legend of the Ghost Warriorwas just okay (about 2 1/2 stars), the soundtrack was better and it's what I remembered the most. The score is good background music for when reading but it's nothing noteworthy or worth remembering when compared to some of the great soundtracks (Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, The Dark Knight). There is a bit of an American Indian influence to the score but again, mostly just subtle enjoyable music to listen to when doing something else."
4,"Three Star Movie, Four Star Album","But we're not talking about the movie. This soundtrack stands so well on it's own as a separate album. Definitely not a soundtrack to a movie where you need to see the movie before you can own the album. A previous review said that the action pieces ""fall flat"" and ""border on the repetitive."" I suppose that is an opinion to which he is entitled, but let me say it is a fact that they do not! Between ""Vikings Attack,"" ""Ghosts Fight Begins,"" ""Quick Kills,"" and ""Gunnars Fury,"" there are a lot of unique and exciting action pieces to be had, each with different themes and backgrounds, just like the battle scenes of a movie change their themes and backgrounds.Step outside the box of the usual sour-lemon critique, and I think you will find that all twenty-three tracks on the album are classically inspired gems, each one standing tall and delivering it's title successfully through music."
3,Not very........,So you pretty much have no Native American music or anything remotely resembling Viking heroic music...it's kinda bland...as was the movie. That will teach me to buy a soundtrack before seeing the film.
2,'Expected more from the 70's legend,"Gloria Gaynor, songstress responsible for possibly the greatest disco anthem of all (""I Will Survive""), seemingly ""rose from the dead"" with this 1995 offering. Long an admirer of the artist, I rushed out and purchased the disc. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations.While some of the selections are enjoyable (""Strive"", ""Remember"", and ""Joy""), the remakes of songs associated with others sadly fall short. Disco versions of standards like ""I'll Be There"", ""You're the First, The Last, My Everything"", ""I Say a Little Prayer,"" and an embarrassingly awful ""I Will Always Love You"" makes one wonder who guided this mess. ""Oh, Happy Day"" will have church choirs cringing.Even her classic ""Survive"" gets a rotten treatment here.A ""diva"" can make a misstep every now and then."
2,Primitive,"Caught by the hype about the book, I started with great enthusiasm. After 100 pages I was still waiting for something worthy to follow, after 300 pages I began to suspect that I'm just wasting my time.. All problems, be it religious, political, human are approached at a high-school level, as if the author himself spent all his life in Gravesend . Most characters are depicted rather superficially. Feels like a book written by a bright college boy who shows promise but too young to take seriously."
2,I just didn't buy it,"Having read this book when it came out, nearly 10 years ago?, I have only fragmentary memories of the plot etc. and am thus unable to string together an impressive and convincing list of its faults. But after scanning the above list of fawning reviews, I feel compelled to relate that after Owen Meany, I resolved never to read another Irvig book. I had grown weary of stories in some way involving bears or trips to Austria (I don't think I am alone in this weariness), so I was already circumspect about reading Irving again. My feeling was that the whole book was a set-up for one climactic moment - and I just didn't buy it. From the glowing testimonials above, it sounds like most readers bought it, though. It's almost enough to tempt me to read it again and see if I missed the boat. Almost"
1,YAAAAAAAAAAAAAWN,"I forced myself to read every page of this book because so many people raved about it, and I had loved ""Cider House Rules"" when I read it years earlier. There were some good moments in the earlier pages, paricularly the hilarious Christmas pageant. After that, it degenerated into a muddled mess that bored me to the point that I wanted to throw it against the wall."
2,What's the hype all about???,"I read this book on the recommendation of two people who's opinions I respect. One of them claims that ""Owen Meany"" is his favorite book of all time and the second person said she just read it for a second time because it's such a ""feel good"" book. Clearly I've missed something. I found this book to be rambling, irritating, and a confusing jumble of Irving's opinions on politics and faith thrown into one story. I just don't get it."
2,Not Irving's best!,"After being a dedicated Irving-fan for years, I was really looking forward to reading ""Owen Meany"". Boy, was I in for a dissapiontment! I struggled through the book. The dialogue and the story lacks all the tender warmth and compassion I feel the author must have felt when writing such excellent books as ""Garp"" and ""Cider House Rules"". ""Owen Meany"" is't a bad book, but from a writer like John Irving your standards get pretty high."
2,I guess I'm the only one who didn't like this book.,"I read this book because I was aware of its imense popularity, yet I was extemely disappointed. In my opinion, the book quickly denegrated into an annoying lecture of the authors religious (protestant) and political (liberal) views. The characters are enjoyable but it was hard for me to stick with the story through all of the authors religious and political references that were not relevant to the inspiring story of the characters."
2,boring book,my son had 2 read this 4 school i think it was very boring and all over the place u cant make heads or tails where their going in this book also if schools have to seperate church & school this should not have to be read
4,A relatively good book,"In A Prayer for Owen Meany, John Irving touches on many complex themes, the most important of these human faith and inability to control fate. Although the long book is eventful and the language simple, at times the book is not easy to read. Somewhere in the middle of the book, it becomes frustrating to read about things that happen for what seems to be no reason at all. However the end of the book resolves nearly all the hanging issues and is very satisfying. Owen Meany is a complex character who at times is just strange, but the reader can't help but feel an attachment for and be inspired by this small-sized character with such strong faith. Irving does a good job on adding irony/humor to the book but most importantly he succeeds in telling a memorable story about faith and predestination."
2,The Boston Marathon of all Books,"Boy, I wanted to like this book because I'd heard so many great things about it. I will probably be flamed for the rest of my life, but I had to use superhuman willpower to get through this book. It's taken nearly six months to push through this long-winded tome. I read voraciously and I simply could not get interested in this book until, quite literally, the last 20 pages, with the last five being riveting. That's one heck of a price to pay for the first 600 pages.To John Irving I respectfully award the ""Get Over Yourself"" award for his endless diatribes and digressions; to the character of Owen Meany I say, ""All right already, we get the picture, just go and do something,"" and last but certainly not least to John Wheelwright, the narrator, ""It's a great big world out there, even in Toronto. DO something! Get a life."" And to Irving's editor, ""You're paid to edit material, regardless of the author's name. So edit!"""
5,Devastating !!!,"I have read so many books in my 45 years, and like one of the other reviewers, am mad it took me so long to find A Prayer for Owen Meany. Mr. Irving creates such a real, richly populated, and intriguing world, that after finishing it, I am impacted with two devastating realities:The first is that the world doesn't really exist. Heavens! Everyone of these characters deserves to live, and I want to know them.Then the next depressing impact is that I do not think I will ever again read a book as enjoyable and absorbing as this one. I am almost mad that Mr. Irving has written such a captivating novel that I have nothing left to look forward too. How can there ever be another novel that so completely captivates and absorbs you. If there is ever going to be a ""Great American Novel,"" this surely is it!Thank you Mr. Irving for A prayer for Owen Meany! Curse you Mr. Irving for A Prayer for Owen Meany!!"
5,It rules!,"I am an avid reader, and count few novels as ""favorites."" This book takes you on a rollercoaster ride that you don't want to see end. Read it!"
4,really good - but the ending could have been better,"The first half of this book was really good. I laughed, I cried, it was better than cats. Although I recognize the evils of the Reagan administration as much as the next guy, I don't need political diatribes sprinkled throughout the narrative. These made the book seem to drag on. The ending seemed to be thrown together and not satisfying. I've heard complaints of endings in other Irving novels - maybe he just needs a good closer - put that coffee down, John!"
3,Good characters but could do without the leftist whining,"Irving wastes his talent in Prayer for Owen Meany by using it as a vehicle for Marxist socialist ranting. If you could take out all the awkwardly forced anti-Reagan stuff, you'd have a pretty good book.Notice that the movie Simon Birch didn't have any of the silly leftist tripe, anti-Vietnamisms or gushing over JFK.Other than that, the characters are interesting and the story is epic. Owen Meany is one of the more memorable characters I've encountered."
5,Owen Meany is unforgettable - for all the right reasons!,"A Prayer for Owen Meany is one of the best books I have ever read, it conjures up so many emotions that it's impossible to list them all. I would just like to say (Owen Meany style) to anyone who has ever been disappointed by a John Irving novel (and there can't be many),""TRY THIS ONE!""."
4,one of my better summer assignments,"A Prayer for Owen Meany was a great book. To a student,reading an assigned book can be an arduous task. For me, this book was a little adventure. Irving's placement of themes and symbols created a perfect balance, where everything came together. I enjoyed Irving's use of certain techniques. I felt they enhanced the emotion in the novel. The story was humorous and heartwarming. The message affected me personally. This was definately a smart choice, and a worthwhile read."
4,"OWEN MEANY, SUPERSTAR","This religious novel about a Christ-like figure who influences all he encounters, laced with dark humor and memorable characters, is a great book that manages not to preach while teaching about faith. I am now also doomed to remember a boy with a wrecked voice. Excellent work from author John Irving."
3,Incredible...riveting..excellent use of creativity,"John Irving has once again proved himself a mastermind of hitting-the-nail-on-the-head of human emotion. The recent movie adaptation entitled, ""Simon Birch"" cannot do the book justice. And as always, John Irving takes the ""surprise ending"" route for the final chapter. Go get this book, you won't be dissapointed."
5,"A book that grows on you, slow build to an explosion!","If I were stuck on a desert isle, here's the book I'd bring. It's long and slow, but grows to an incredible ending. You will remember the characters and think about them for YEARS! It's about boys at a religious New England prep school and a unique character, Owen Meaney. This book has it all, I don't want to give away more--serious and funny, hard to read but worth it. A book of depth and great characterization. Also some of the most incredible foreshadowing you will ever see. Irving's masterpiece. Start with Garp, end with Owen Meaney"
2,Liked it at first,"I really liked the book at first, because Owen was such an interesting character and I just wanted to know more and more about him, but as the book progressed, I lost interest in Owen and the book.This is my first experience with Irving, although I certainly won't make it my last, since he is such an accomplished writer.The religious and political aspects of the book actually made me feel bored and uneasy at different points in the book. I felt that there was no true plot to the book and the ending was very strange."
4,a powerful story of friendship and fate,"A Prayer for Owen Meany, by John Irving is a truly fascinating novel. The plot line keeps the reader absorbed in the story and wanting to continue reading. The two main characters are connected in an inspiringly powerful bond of friendship that remains steady throughout the novel. Owen Meany is unlike any other character I have encountered. He is unique in countless ways, which enables the reader to constantly be intrigued by what he has to say. Although, Owen's character throughout the novel does not appear to change significantly, his character does influence Johnny Wheelwright who is clearly heavily impacted by Owen. There are many powerful moments that fully engage the reader as well develop a curiosity to keep reading. The only flaw was that some parts seemed a little too long or unnecessary, however I would still definitely recommend this book."
4,"Slow in developing, but a very rich reading experience","Very long, slow developing story that eventually tied together nicely at the end. Although I did not start out particularly liking the story or the characters therein, I did find it to be well-written and thought provoking. Unfortunately for the average reader it may not be worth the incredible amount of time required to digest the entire story."
2,I wouldn't recommend it...,"I heard several people rave about this book, so I bought it. After reading it, I can't understand why people find it so wonderful. The first few chapters were pretty good, but after John and Owen become teenagers everything goes downhill pretty fast. After this point I did _not_ find Owen to be a likeable character -- in fact he irritated me. And the thing about his immaculate conception? After reading about ""his dream"" and the gravestone for chapters and chapters I found his death to be hilarious. Or maybe it was supposed to be? Was this whole book supposed to be ridiculous?"
3,Quite good,"The middle section of the book (150 pages or so) seemed to go on and on, and I found it extremely hard to keep going. I did, though, and the last couple of hundred pages were quite a good read. There's a very good punchline on the last couple of pages."
3,Review,I ordered a paperback book and received a hardback. It also took longer to receive than expected.
4,all about a dream,"well by the end of this book... i just finished it this morning... i was thinking what would happend when...it left me with many questions.so many ways to change the life of owen this book told me how horrible your life can become (and end ) when you are convinced by something (like owen the instrument of god...and his dream), but on the other hand it showed also how live can be created just for one purpose(and who is the creater after all? god or our own imagination while life is pushing us forward?). this book will give am impressive answer to the question "" why am on this planet and what is my purpose here?""the story is good besides the parts playing in toronto. i laughed with the characters cried was stunning how the story turned in the end and everything made sense in the end. irving is a master of creating characters. its my third book i read written by him and they satisfied me all. irving gives the strange characters and they view on life an voice once again!!"
3,"Humor, Emotion, Perversion","The humor, the perversion, the emotion, these are the things that made A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY an iteresting book. The book was a lot like reality but strange enough to remain itresting. There were parts of the book that were slow and pointless-seeming, but those parts were always followed by very intertaining, most of the time funny sections. There were also parts of the book that were discusting. John's almost incestuous relationship with his cousin Hester made me sick to my stomach. Although these parts keept me in the book, they made me laugh. The book overall to me I will remember for a long time. I ended up likeing this book and all of it's characters through the humorous, perver- ted, and emotional sections. It was not my favorite, but I do recomend that everyone read it because it could be you favorite."
1,I got sick of the capital type of Owen's speech,"Eh, this book didn't catch me as well as THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP DID. I got sick of the capital type of Owen's speech, it was painful to read."
1,So overrated I can't believe it,"I heard this book was ""life-changing"" and the only thing life-changing about it is that it is so long & tedious to get through, I now have less life to live! This book should have been edited down to half the length. The writing isn't even that compelling, although there are the occasional laugh-out-loud passages, but boring and pedantic for the greater part. The characters are two dimensional and very predictable, which significantly weakens the plot.I didn't mind the political thread running through, but again, where was the editor? Everything about the book was too repetitive and heavy handed. I just cannot imagine how this book could be so popular."
1,Terribly boring,This was the assigned book for my book club. I was so entirely bored and unengaged with the characters that I could not get more than a third of the way through the book. Painfully SLOW. I simply didn't care what happened to any of the characters.
1,I must have read the wrong book!,"I don't get it! While this book was easy to read, it was so boring to read that I grew angrier with each page instead of interested! On and on about the same things. The characters were flat -- neither likable nor unlikable -- more like background at a dull party."
3,"Don't hate me because I'm beautiful, or because I disagree",I was mostly disappointed in this book. I wanted it to be funnier...or funny period
2,NO MORE CAPITALS!,"Was Owen always YELLING or were the capitals just to emphasize his odd voice? O.K., I know it was the latter, but it still seemed to me like he was ALWAYS YELLING!! Very annoying and distracting from the book, although I didn't find it much to be distracted from...the shot, Hester throwing up, etc..."
4,My thanks to John Irving.,"When I finished reading A Prayer For Owen Meany, I was left with mixed feelings. Anxiety and sorrow but also immense gratification. I was grateful obviously to John Irving for having the scope to write a novel as exciting, varied and unique as he has. But I was also sorrowful that I had and would never in my lifetime meet someone as magical as Owen. I also however felt anxious and a little worried that I would never again read a novel which would affect me in the same way!To anyone who hasn't read Owen Meany I say ""read it now"" and to those who have I suggest they feel lucky to have experienced, if only through John Wheelwright, Owen Meany's amazing life and to learn as much as they can from the little man who everybody loves."
4,This was a good book.More action needed.,"I think more description would be helpful.for the most part I realy liked this book.I recomend it.It's really intence.sighned,LostLove"
2,Maybe I'm missing something,"I was surprised, but I didn't enjoy this book at all. I felt like I was being hit over the head with symbolism (hands being cut off, etc) and never understood many of the relationships (how did Owen and John become friends? how did Hester and Owen hit it off somehow?) Between this and Cider House Rules, I felt like the same characters were hitting me over the head: the weak father figures, the sexually ambivalent males, the strong-willed but sexually predatory and tormented women (either that or they were dumb-mute type women). I won't be reading any more Irving. Seemed to me the man needs therapy."
5,Good,"It's all too easy to say the last great book I read was the best I've ever read. I read this book in 1990, and still haven't read one since that tops it."
5,His Best,"Everyone who knows Irving's work knows what a fan of Dickens he is; this book is the proof. If you like the novel, I highly recommend reading it and ""Great Expectations"" back to back. It's a great juxtaposition and adds the pleasure of both novels"
5,Could not stop listening. Just amazing.........,"John Irving is a masterful writer who never ceases to amaze me with his intimate details about his characters, as he takes the reader deeper and deeper in to the story as if you are there witnessing the whole story for yourself.As for Joe Barrett, the reader, his distinct voice is ideal for the story. His ability to change his voice for the different characters is amazing, it makes it as if you were really there. Just amazing...."
5,Owen Meany has had a profound impact,"When I started to read ""Owen"" a month ago, I knew I was in for another unbelieveable yarn written by the genius that is John Irving. Reading ""Garp"" prior to this, I was aware of how involved I was going to become in this book, both because of its length but also because of its epic story telling. A Prayer for Owen Meany was the only book that ever made this accomplished reader cry. I only hope by me saying Owen is my favorite book my sentiment towards this novel is not lessened or cheapened."
5,Just read it.,"This book is practically impossible to put down. Irving combines comedy, tragedy, faith, and destiny in the story of one tiny yet incredibly powerful person named Owen Meany. Owen is an extremely intelligent, extremely short, and extremely harassed child who puts his faith in front of all and does many people a lot of good. He is a ""Voice"" for his generation throughout the story and he is endearing and lovable through every scene. This book teaches lessons about life, love, and faith and it will definitely stick with you for a long time."
3,"A ""Not so proposterous"" book","A Prayer for Owen Meany was long but heartfelt. Every page was important in the end, surprising or not. It was a good book, but you were happy when the 600-page book was over. It was too much religion for me. It was important to show the power of Owen's faith, but it was still a little much. Owen Meany, ""the granite Mouse,"" was a four-foot tall angel that affected a small town and showed them what true faith was. I think he could possible have been ""god's instrument,"" but he was definetly a hero. John Wheelwright, the narrator of the book, and Owen's best friend was the one who needed the help, not the midget with the squeaky voice. Even though Owen took Joe's mom, a middle finger and Joe's cousin, Owen gave Joe so much more. Not only did Owen give him a best friend, or faith, but he also gave him hope for a future. Because this book was so long, I think it took something away from the passionate book. I give this book three-and-a-half stars!"
2,Is it just me?????,"I don't understand all the hype surrounding this novel. I read the book on the high recommendation of my mother, whose taste almost always comports with mine. It was a chore to get through the whole thing. I felt like, knowing from the first chapters that Owen is special and believes he is the instrument of God, it took entirely too long to tell the whole story. I couldn't sympathize with any of the characters, and I found the grown up John to be a complete bore and a dolt. The length and slow pace of the story frustrated me. Maybe one has to be an Irving fan to enjoy Owen Meany; I admit that I am not -- I did not like A Widow for One Year, though I rate it higher than Owen Meany (at least 3 stars). In all, Owen Meany, for me, fell far below the hype."
2,Eager anticipation turns to disappointment,"I was very eager to read this book-- it had come highly recommended by a reliable source. Therefore, I was dismayed when 250 pages into this book, I was still unsure as to the purpose and plot of this novel. Perhaps I missed the point, but it was a challenge forcing myself to finish the book. I found John Irving's writing style pedantic, boring, and repetitive. His word usage, I felt, was more for effect than for substance..... just my humble opinion."
2,Slow,I loked the book for the most part. It got really slow on the middle so i skipped to the last chapter and hadnt missed a thing. It was recommended to me by a friend. I dont think I would recommend it.
3,A Prayer for Owen Meany,"I love the book. It came in a timely fashion, however I was hoping the paper back book would be one of the larger ones. I just don't like the feel of a small one any longer"
1,Disappointed in a repetitive story,"Friends at work raved about this book. Having read other books by John Irving (Hotel New Hampshire, World According to Garp) and enjoying other books these friends had recommended, I thought it might be interesting. Irving's style wasn't exactly what I normally read, but the books of his I'd read so far certainly had interesting stories.Unfortunately, A Prayer for Owen Meany struck me as repetitive. The same plot points were repeated several times. There were a few sections that were interesting and/or funny. I kept reading, hoping that the story would pick up, or, at least, stop repeating, but it never happened. I kept going, based on the recommendations. After reading about half of the book, I just had to stop. I decided I'd rather spend what little time I have to read recreationally reading a more interesting book."
2,A boring book....,"If you like Irving's books, please read The World According to Garp or Cider House Rules. Owen Meany is not worth your time. It's tedious. I know that some people have called this a challenging read. It's only challenging because it bores the reader to tears. Skip A Prayer for Owen Meany. John Irving has definitely written better books."
1,not one of John Irving's better books,"I bought a copy of A Prayer for Owen Meany based on the fact I have read and enjoyed other books by John Irving. Mr. Irving's books are usually offbeat and I like that about him. This book, however, was boring. I am like some of the other people here who started reading the book, but could not finish. Dull City!"
2,Irving's Worst Novel: Read Eveything Else but This,"This novel is tedious, redundant, and utterly boring. Irving is one of my favorite writers of all time: Cider House Rules is by far his best with interesting characters and profound social commentary. Hotel New Hampshire and World According to Garp are incredible. A Widow for One Year is astoundingly well done and very entertaining. This one blows!"
1,This book was B-O-R-I-N-G!,"This novel was lifeless. It just dragged on and on, and took me forever to get through it. I do not recommend this novel."
2,Disappointing,"The blurb on the back of this book said ""one of Irving's most comical novels"" or something very much to that effect. I hope this is not so. I had never read Irving and hoped to find something with the quirky characters I've seen in the Garp movie. No luck. The book has an awkward sense of time, moving back and forth much too often. As an aspiring writer, I find it incredibly in need of editing also. It meanders so much, almost like a King novel. What should take one page to describe often takes 2 or 3. If I submitted something like this, do you think it would have been accepted? The first 600 pages of this book is merely a set-up for the last 10. Skip the 500 pages in the middle, as I did. This would have worked much better as a 30 page short story."
1,What's with the hype????,"After reading and falling in love with Garp, I couldn't wait to dive into this Irving masterpiece, so loved by so many people. Let me tell you, this was the most drawn out book i have ever read. I was extremely perturbed with all his political and religious diatribe. Although I consider myself an avid reader, I have never had a harder time getting through a book. What a let-down. Don't waste your time."
1,A Prayer for Owen Meany,"My one star rating is not about the book, it's concerning the publisher. I won't rate the book until I finish reading it. After reading 370 pages, the next pages were 179-242(pages I had read previously). Then the page number is 435 ending with page 617. If the book had just a few pages missing, no worries. But after reading 370 pages, 63 pages missing is just not acceptable. I went to a book store to see if they could help me, but was told Amazon would be my only solution. What a hassle?? This is when internet shopping is complicated."
2,Owen is Interesting. John is a Looser,"Book starts great. By the time you get to the middle, it gets boring. Who cares what goes on in Toronto!!!!All questions are answered in last chapter. Even with that it's anticlimactic. Not sure I'd recommend it. Definately not one of John Irving's better books."
2,A Prayer for Owen Meany,"I thought the writing was great, but for some reason the story just didn't catch with me. There was a couple spots I thought it could have ended, and it would have been fine with me, but it kept going on and on. I did see the movie Simon Birch and I liked it a little better than the book. However, the movie only touched on a few spots of the book. Most people I've talked to liked this book (and love John Irving), So I guess I'm just the odd man out this time. I am planning on reading some of his other books, someday."
3,My review a few years ago,"This is the review of it I wrote for my person reading log about 4.5 years ago. I do not think it changes anything, but worth noting:Having loved The World According to Garp and having enjoyed Cider House Rules, I had high hope for this. While I did like it, I certainly didn't love it. I felt like there was not really a strong plot or purpose. I mention purpose because not all of his book have a clear plot but you understand that there sounds like a plan behind it. That is not the case for Owen Meany. Between the two (three?) story lines and the jumpy-ness, it lacked that. The book kept referring to Owen as going to be a miracle or something like that. While the story definitely does the ""miracle"" title just enough justice, it lacks in emphasis. I just didn't love it overall and I was disappointed considering Irving's other work."
4,Owen Meany: A Dramatic Tale of a Second Prince of Peace,"I enjoyed John Irving's novel for the most part. Some parts of the story seemed unbelievable, but, on the whole, it was a touching book. One thing that really stood out for me was the religious references throughout the story. I found this aspect of the book very thought-provoking. For example, Owen Meany's idea that Jesus Christ was ""used"" is a whole new idea about the Easter story for me. Also, the very idea that Owen Meany was a ""virgin birth"", a second Christ child, is particularly intriguing to me. One aspect of the book that I have mixed feelings about is the way the book was written. It jumped all over time, sometimes before finishing an important part. For example, we were told about Owen Meany's funeral before we were told about his death. At times this technique was frustrating, but I think mostly it added dramatic effect. Overall, I thought this was a pretty good book. I thought it was well-written and very creative. Four stars!"
4,Love it,I love this book it is thoughtful and faithful and makes you feel like your actually like in the story
5,So nice I bought it twice,"I wore my other copy of this completely out between re-reads and forcibly loaning it to other people. This is my favorite book in the world! You have to read it more than once to pick up on all the nuance, but the read is always a fantastic journey from beginning to end."
3,"An okay book, but way too long","A Prayer for Owen Meany is a memoir about Johnny Wheelwright, a New Hampshire boy in the '50s and his midget friend, Owen. Owen killed Johnny's mother with a baseball, but they remain friends. Throughout the book, the author flashes to 1987 only to criticize American foreign policy, specifically Ronald Reagan's administration. Owen yelled at his parents at a play, has a very high pitch voice and he likes Liberace. Later after Owen dies, Johnny becomes a Canadian for no particular reason. The book is over 600 pages long. That is WAY too long."
1,John Irving and the complainer's novel,"Irving's A Prayer For Owen Meany is all about a rambling, disgusted god who condemns the world and cannot tell man what is right. The new gospel's salvation is not based on loving your neighbor as you would love yourself, but instead focuses on venting the anger of mankind towards the current system by criticizing every thing it does without having the power to solve those problems. Basically, if a god condemns all the institutions of man, the victims of the world (who in the end extends to everyone in death) are assured that all of their problems originate from the current system and regime. Everyone eventually will be defeated by life, and it feels good to go kicking and screaming in protest like Owen instead of being silent like the Christ of the Bible. In short, it is a ""feel good"" novel, perhaps explaining why A Prayer for Owen Meany was #1 International Best Seller. Anybody who reads this book is a chronic complainer with nothing to do."
5,A Prayer for Owen Meany,"John Irving did a really great job with this book. Owen Meany is a character that I will never forget. The strong personality, mixed with his crass personality, Owen keeps the readers in the book. The ending definitely did the book justice. Even the earliest of events, all tie in at the end! A Prayer for Owen Meany is definite must!"
3,Didn't Grab Me,"I wanted to love this book, but it just didn't grab me. The author took way too long to get into the story...he rambled and meandered and...lost me somewhere along the way."
5,Simply one of the best books I have ever read,"This book is simply inspiring. Owen Meany is one of the greatest tragic heroes ever conceived, and reading the book moved me like no other book ever has. I laughed, I cried, and I read it all again. Irving is truly a genius, and unlike Garp, has written long enough to complete a true masterpiece."
5,In the top five of my all time favorites.,"I read an average of 5 books a week but I can't think of any book that has moved me like A Prayer for Owen Meany. It is one of the few books I re-read every couple of years. Strong non-denominational spirituality, it makes you WANT to believe. A must read."
5,Graham Greene's successor,"A weird boy's life is God's miracle. Dreams come true. Nothing is pointless, including impulses to assisted slam dunking in three seconds or under. Like Graham Greene, Irving sees sinful people able to shake themselves under pressure and deliver moments, periods even lives filled with grace and meaning."
5,Spiritual,"I've read everything by Irving, but Prayer for Owen Meany struck a chord. I think it takes a special person with a special slant on life to appreciate Irving's depth, I wish Hollywood would stop trying to recreate something that is only able to exist in written form. A rich book."
5,Simply unforgettable!,"Nearly ten years ago I read 'A Prayer for Owen Meany'. I have to say that this is one of very few books that have made such a strong impact on me. I still remember it as I just should have finished it, followed by a very good feeling. This book is rare."
5,"Very Spiritual and Uplifting,Everyone should read it.","A positive book about a boy going through life's everyday's troubles.Owen and John, his friend help each other through hard times."
2,A Prayer for Owen Meany,"The book didn't keep my interest, boring and redundant and the characters kept moving back to the original scene, so never felt like the story was going anywhere. I didn't even finish the story."
4,"Interesting Story, Disgusting Narrator","This is a rich, thoughtful and amusing tale involving several characters surrounding Owen Meany, a mysticism-steeped little scrapper who was apparently destined to play major roles in the lives of people around him. For that alone, this book is well worth reading.The narrator, however, constantly denigrated the US government's executive administration of those times, revealing a severe misunderstandings for how to deal with evil in the world -- in addition to a lot of weak personal insecurity. His whining and carping distracted significantly from an otherwise satisfying tale."
5,A Favorite for Random Reading,"In A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANEY, John Irving never denigrates or insults. He doesn't leave you with unopposed ideas. Rather, he presents a complete picture of human nature - the pluses and the negatives. And so he perhaps inspires us to look for the same. There is an honoring of human possibilities in his writing that makes for rewarding reading. Along with William Faulkner he seems to believe that man will not only endure, he will prevail."
5,Funniest book...,"This book is one of the funniest books I have ever read in a while. Irving keeps you on your toes as you experience life through the eyes of a boy. The book is relatively easy to read as every little detail is explained. The character development is excellent as Irving brings out the true nature of the people in the town of Gravesend. The plot is also very unique, but very enthralling. This book might seem political or religious, but it is truly a story of deep friendship. Though the many circumstances in this book might seem outrageous, anyone can pick up the book and relate to the bond which the book has been focused around."
4,Not meant to be a quick read...,"Although extremely lengthy and made even more so by plenty of tangents and jumps between the past and the present, A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY is a profound book. Its central theme is the blind faith that is demonstrated by Owen Meany and observed by his best friend, John Wheelwright. One of the things that make this book both good and irritating is the style of the narration. By recording all the memories or opinions that come to him as he remembers or thinks of them, John connects and relates everyone and everything with each other, creating a complete picture for the reader. For impatient readers, the style may be irritating, but I believe the book as a whole is well worth the time spent reading it. The themes are well developed, and the ending is very conclusive and final--i.e. you're not left with the feeling that it's incomplete or that you want more. Overall, a very good book but somewhat difficult to read straight through."
3,"Good read, but not Irving's best.","The story line was engaging, the plot good and I had trouble putting it down, but the ending was very predictable and left me feeling let down."
2,Stealth political commentary,"The first 80 pages were fine. I read with interest as the narrator, who now lives in Canada, recounted his boyhood in New Hampshire and his relationship with his too-small friend, Owen Meany. Then, out of nowhere, bam! -- a few paragraphs on why Ronald Reagan was so evil. Then a few pages later, a three-page diatribe on the immorality of the Vietnam War. Summary: If you're still living in the sixties, and enjoy Oliver Stone, this book may be for you. If your political views lie elsewhere, be forewarned."
5,A CLASSIC.,"Perhaps one of the finest novels I've ever read. I had first read ""Prayer"" a few years ago and although I found it both fascinating and stimulating then, I don't think that it had touched me the way it did this time around. The passages which describe Owen's faith shamed my lack of it. I was moved to tears and laughter and in a strange way some of my faith was restored. In what in particular I don't know but it evoked all sorts of feelings within me. I would recommend this book not only as a wonderful read, but for anyone who may want to get in touch with any long ago lost faith or hope. Or for anyone who'd like to welcome one of the best characters ever written into their lives. This book helped solidify John Irving as one of my favorite authors."
5,GREAT READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This has to be one of the best books I have ever read (and I am an avid reader.) I recently saw the movie - ""Simon Birch"" - and while this movie was great - it could only portray a portion of Owen/Simon's life. The book is a great continuation of Owen (Simon's) life and I highly reccomend reading it if you enjoyed the movie.John Irving has the best character developement of any author I have ever read and I was sad to end the book and leave Owen's life. The book was great. It made me laugh and cry. Like I said before, it is one of the best books written."
4,Very Interesting,"This was such a strange story to follow. I think the only reason i actually finished this book was because i wanted to see how Irving would pull it together at the end. Which he did, and i was impressed....as usual. At times I found myself reading the same paragragh a couple of times. But i base alot of my opinion on a story's ending, so i would have to recommend this book to anyone who is a believer of God, or even just mildly religious. i honestly think it will bring you more faith than you thought possible."
1,Surrealism in print,John Irving's surreal novel trips the dark fantastic in a way that leaves the reader feeling haunted by a cloud of despair. Readers are encouraged to have a heavy dose of hilarity handy before attempting this deep dive into depression.
1,Mind-Numbing Pabulum,"If you're a religious wackaloon, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, don't bother. Don't get me wrong, the writing in this novel is perhaps Irving's best ever...it's just the premise behind this story that makes it a 1 star read. Even if you're intellectually undeveloped enough to believe in God, you must ask yourself why an omnipotent being would go to such great lengths to accomplish, in Owen Meany, what he could easily do himself simply by waving his magic wand (or whatever it is the Christian God uses to perform miracles)? Then again, I guess it's no surprise that in a nation full of brain-dead Bible thumpers who consider absurd myths like Noah's ark and Jonah and the whale as actual occurrences, this novel not only seems plausible, but inspiring. To those of us who have learned to think critically, however, this book is 600 pages of mind-numbing pabulum."
1,Truly terribly written and even worse story line,"This book is not at all what I expected from John Irving. Not only is the story weak, it is truly insipid and carries on and on with vulgar and unrelated information for pages and pages. The book focuses on this supposedly faithful Owen Meany, who is a complete hipocrite, and works completely against the them of faith that is supposed to be put forth. I truly have never found a more mediocre and badly written story with as irritating a character as Owen Meany and his rediculuously pathetic friend who narrates the story. How John Irving of all people manages to come up with the out there story line is incomprehensible - it seems as if he couldn't decide what type of story he wanted to write. The only thing that is more amazing than that an excellent writer could write such basic level trash is that people could actually enjoy it. Save yourself and read one of his other books."
1,"Cheap knock off of ""The Tin Drum""","Every major element of Grass's ""The Tin Drum"" is stolen and made sappy: main character with stunted growth and unusual voice who works with stonecutting. Irving would probably call it an homage, but I call it cheap, thinly veiled plagiarism."
1,Utter Pigswill,"For my A.P. English class, we were presented with this book and an alternative choice. Heeding the advice of my good friend, I selected this one. I will never forgive him for this. The book was painfully tedious, and I regret wasting two precious weeks of my summer reading it. There is no interesting premise, and the notion of this peculiar child as a Christ figure was extremely far-fetched. His death comes as nothing more than a great relief that the book must, it simply must, be reaching its long-awaited conclusion. The great speeches, entirely in capitals, makes one feel as though the book is screaming at you, and no one wants to be screamed at. Additionally, the vignettes concerning the Reagan Administration were mindless drivel, not because of Irving's politics but because of their poor inter-weaving into the body as a whole. It has been a few years since I suffered through this, and in retrospect I feel that my time, and not Owen Meany, was the martyr here."
5,"Brief Review of ""Owen Meany""",One of my all-time favorite books; easily in my top 10. I bought a hardcover copy just so I could lend it to friends from time to time. It's now in the hands of a friend from PA.
5,"An Intellectually Stimulating Read: ""Richly textured...Carefully Wrought""","This book comes highly recommended by me.I first read this several years ago after finishing Sparks' A Walk to Remember and was seeking a similar read. Boy, was I in for a pleasent surprise!This long novel by John Irving tells the story of two boys (Johnny and Owen Meany), best friends growing up in a small New England town (the fictitious Gravesend, New Hampshire). Only Owen is abnormally small and has a fixed voice box. Consequently, his speech is done in ALL CAPITALS. Both boys embark on an extraordinary journey of dicovery and redemption.This book holds much in common with Dickens, and if you like him, you'll love this. Irving even incorporates Christmas themes with the Christ story and A Christmas Carol. Also, the book acts as a memoir and political commentary on the Reagan Administration. Nice touch.Stephen King called this ""...richly textured and carefully wrought...""It is definately that."
5,PLEASE DO NOT END!,"I know proper netiquette and that CAPS are shouting. All of Owen Meany's dialogue is in caps way before there was any netiquette.I have never written a review before for a book that I have yet to complete. However, I find this read so compellingly entertaining and enthralling that I have slowed down my usual reading pace and also find myself rereading paragraphs simply because they are so damn good. I am about 75% through the book and dread completion.I find it interesting that other reviewers forced to read for class assignments do not enjoy. This book needs to be savored like the finest of wines.ENJOY!"
4,Would love to give this book three ratings,"I've always been told to take my age, double it...and give a book that many pages before deciding whether to invest the time.Thankfully, I liked the first 76 pages of this book well enough to continue. I'd give the ""beginning"" four stars. You know Owen is something special, but you just can't figure out quite why.""The middle"" is admittedly rather boring, and dated in some of its references. I felt as though I were reading something meant for my father's time. There were enough quality moments in it, however, to keep on even while vaguely wondering what else my shelves contained...rating the ""middle"" two stars.""The ending"" makes everything come together. It's a five star ending by anyone's standards. It makes every page of this book worthwhile."
4,"Good book, a little long winded","I liked this book. If you have seen the movie ""Simon Birch"" you got a small glimpse of this tale. It follows the lives of two friends who grow up in the 50's and early 60's. One is a 'normal' kid, the other is a 'prodigy' but also a very small person (I cant say he is a dwarf like in the above mentioned movie, because then a lot of the things that happened in the book could not have actually happened). The ending was a surprise, I actually did not see it coming until right before it happened, and I think I am usually pretty good at picking up on those things. Sometimes the author got a little long winded about trivial crap, but for the most part it flowed together and you got a feeling that you were in the story with the characters. My one disappointment was how the main character ended up living his life, but you will have to read and judge for yourself."
5,"Moving, inspiring, excellent","Oh, there's not much that I can say beyond what hundreds of others have already said. Owen Meany is beautifully written and the characters are as memorable as they come. Having read all of Irving's books, and loved most of them, I found this to be his best. Irving is one of the best writers currently at work today: he does not sacrifice literate writing for the sake of a fun and emotional novel, nor does his story sink beneath the weight of pretentious prose. Most importantly, his stories are fresh and the characters are unique: and that's why people keep coming back for more. You never know what he'll think up next."
3,decent but writing style annoying,"John Irving's narrator tells this story in such a wordy, roundabout way that you really have to want to read this book in order to finish it. He endlessly discusses various Christian denominations with a level of minutiae that was frankly boring. Many scenes are wonderful, though. And this roundabout style made for some nice moments when all of a sudden the ramblings resulted in a payoff. But often there was no payoff. The characters were memorable, though. Overall I liked it but I'd never read it again. I read this not long after finishing ""The World According to Garp,"" the only other Irving book I've read and I liked ""Garp"" better."
2,jaimelire,"I bought this book for its 4.5 stars.....After 15% into the reading and not liking the unfolding of it all, I went back to read the reviews...I am among those who are not taken by the story, the personages and the slow motion of it all. Could not go any further into the reading. Deleted ."
4,Rollercoaster Ride,"This book was required reading for sophmore year. When I bought it, I grimaced, thinking that my summer had hardly begun, yet I'd have to read this 600+ page book. But as I began reading it, I hardly hated it as much as I thought I would; in fact I actually liked it. I was into it the whole time. I couldn't put it down, because I kept wanting to know what was going to happen next. And because of Irving's descriptions, it seemed as if I could feel the characters emotions. I went from laughing histerically to being in awe, to almost feeling as if I was going to cry. This is a pretty good book, especially considering that I had to read it for school over my long awaited summer vacation. I think everyone should give it a chance and read it."
3,"I've never liked John Irving much, but I do like Owen","For years, I've thought of John Irving as a one-trick pony. Garp, Cider House, Hotel New Hampshire, they all felt the same to me. Funky New Englanders experience wild passions, all too briefly, then resume forging their tiny lives of quiet desperation. In many ways Owen Meany is just as fantastic as other Irving stories, but instead of dithering over one contemporary topic after another, Irving endorsed old fashioned values like faith and friendship. Corny as it sounds, Owen gave me hope."
2,Disappointing,"The book has its enjoyable moments, and Irving is sometimes very funny in relaying anecdotes and scenes. As a complete novel, however, he misses by a wide margin. One particularly annoying device is Irving's repeated and ham-handed fore-shadowing: ""As you shall see..."" and ""As it all became clear to me later..."" I'm surprised his editor wasn't able to guide him away, as those points seemed more appropriate for a high school creative writing assignment."
5,Mystical Hope,"This was the first John Irving novel I read; it's also my favorite, even after having read all of his other books.The characters - as well as the winding plot progression - are imaginative and throroughly interesting.Irving's protagonist's (Owen's) strength, unbending faith, conviction and certainty are a nice portrait in contrast: With his tiny, fragile physical frame. The true self certainly radiates forth from within, and Irving illustrates this beautifully. Unlike some books with metaphysically speculative themes; this one is hilarious ! As the story unfolds - out of nowhere - side-splitting humor emerges again and again.Johnny's METANOIA is convincing and - ultimately - inspiring. When all is said and done, this is a tale of MYSTICAL HOPE: NOT in outcomes, but in TRUSTING THE PROCESS of evolution ... or ... God's will. Choose any theological/metaphysical characterization you like ... in the end, IT'S ALL THE SAME."
2,I didn't finish reading it.,"I found the parts about his friendship with Owen Meany were good, but it just didn't capture my interest that much. To be frank, I thought the use of language to be crude. I just don't care for that and found it particularly unnecessary in this book."
5,Loved!,I could listen to books like this forever. Great story. Makes you laugh and cry and before you know it your their close friends!
2,People have been recommending this book to me forever...,"... so I finally got a copy, ready to enjoy it. Halfway through, still waiting for anything interesting to happen, I gave up. Clearly John Irving is just not for me.For the record, I've never managed to finish ""The Catcher in the Rye"" either."
4,Great characters,"Not yet finished the book, but so far it is an entertaining read. The premise is unusual and sad and hard to absorb, but the book remain enjoyable."
4,Has Its Flaws But Owen's Story Is Charming & Haunting,"Even though Owen is very small, his character is larger than life, and his story is both tragic and magical. What impressed me most about this book was the way the story ties together so perfectly in the end. It just blew me away! Yes, there are many imperfections in this novel: it's too long, the female characters aren't solid, and if you hate liberals you're going to hate it, but Owen's story reached me in a way that few books ever do. I gave a copy to my mother and she had very much the same reaction."
5,"no wonder there are so many 10's here,","the book lives up to the hype you read here. one that has the ability to truly change your life. I don't know anyone who doesn't like this book. and the detail, it is truly dickensian. you will not be disappointed, unless you don't buy it in hardback, cause you will want to read it over and over again."
5,What a story!,"I just finished reading Owen Meany yesterday and I am sad that the book had to come to an end. I loved the story! I have had a lot of good friends in my life but none like Owen. The book made me think of the silly things I've done with my friends and I thought ""the shot"" was just another quirky thing they did together. I really made me stop and replay the entire book in my mind when it finally came to a close. I know I will read it again."
5,Irving's Prayer is Answered,"Owen Meany's best friend John narrates this epic tale of what it takes to be friends and remain headstrong in a sometimes cruel and challenging world. After John's mother is accidently killed during a softball game, John's search for answers about the incident and other life matters leads him to best friend Owen, who teaches him what it means to be a small boy with a strange voice and still make a big impression on an indifferent world. This book teaches the world to cherish each day and each person. Irving's humorous witticism is enlightening and cunningly pervasive. This book will always be my favorite."
4,"This is a unique and unbelievable, yet forceful story.","This novel compels the reader to reflect on his own destiny. It makes us wonder if Owen Meany is a second Christ. He is certainly God's instrument, following what is predestined for him. There is much foreshadowing, and all the loose strings become tied together by the end of the book. But fault must be found, however, with the lengthiness of it. Too much needless detail bogs the reader down from time to time, lessening the impact of the story."
3,Pretty good,"The opening chapter of this book might be the best opening chapter I've ever read. Irving does a brilliant job of introducing the characters in a way that is unique, humorous, and tragic all at the same time. Likewise, the last 70 pages are wonderful. However, the 500 pages in the middle are simply way too long and wordy. If this book were 400-450 pages long, it would be in my top 5 of all time!"
5,Definitely Worth Reading,"No library is complete without this book - I mean that. I'm an avid reader with many favorites, but I have to say that ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"" is one of my all-time favorites. It's so different from any other literature that it really speaks to readers in a way vastly different from anything else.This book is worth reading over and over again."
5,outrageous humor,"owen meany is the kid you knew in grade school who refused to leave you alone until you let him play with you (get your mind out of the gutter). his voice was annoying, his persistence indestructible. he could debate you into submission because he was smart as heck. there are episodes in owen meany's life that are absolutely hysterical. the scene at the christmas pageant is one that i will never forget (an opinion that is shared by my friends who have read this book as well). reading ""a prayer for owen meany"" is an extremely rewarding experience that will give you the urge to read it again. and, most likely, you will."
3,Not my favorite John Irving book...,"While I do agree that Irving has a unique way of developing characters, dialogue, comedy and plotting that is ""magical,"" this book is not Irving's best. Very slow moving. It has moments of ""laugh-out-loud"" humor, however, the narrator's current day musings of his life in Canada are superflous hyperbole. The dark undertones of this book are typical Irving, but I was left wanting more in the end. I would recommend GARP or Hotel New Hampshire to a friend, but not Owen Meany."
1,"""Dickensian"" MY ARSE","Several times, I've seen people compare John Irving to Charles Dickens. This could not be further from the truth. Dickens wrote in a way that allows the reader to make his/her own discoveries about a character through patient, nuanced prose that is in no sense self-aware. Irving, in contrast, like so many popular contemporary authors, draws such conclusions for the reader, telling him/her exactly what to think. If I had the book with me, I'd dig up an example passage, but I'm talking about things like, ""He was one of those people who has property X.""To make matters worse, the narration from Canada was out of place and exceedingly awkward, and it even weakened the already ruined novel.Recommended for light entertainment only, and even that only for those who do not mind prose that is blatantly self-conscious."
5,"Poignant, thought-provoking reading.","I was enthralled at the beginning. Thought provoking and poignant, this story will make you think, question and embrace your beliefs. I could not put it down."
4,Haunting,"This was the first John Irving book that I read. It was difficult to ""get into"" the novel for the first few hundred pages or so. However, there came a point when I could not put this book down! Now, weeks later, I find myself still thinking about the characters. After loving the haunting tale of ""Owen Meany"", I was excited when ""Simon Birch"" came to video. I thought the adaptation for the movie was absolutely awful! - the book was infinitely better. It's amazing how some movies can destroy an author's characters and story. After ""Owen Meaney"", I read ""A Widow for One Year"". From the beginning, I could not put this novel down...I'm currently reading ""The 158-pound Marriage"". Irving is a terrific author!"
5,Magnificent!,"I began this book around Christmastime of 1998 because I had chosen to take part in a literary competition comparing this novel, and The Giant's House by Elizabeth McCracken. I had never before heard anything about this wonderful novel, or of John Irving. I began the journey, at once captivated. Needless to say, I spent the majority of my vacation reading this delightful novel. I have never felt so strongly about a piece of fiction, and perhaps I won't again. But it has inspired me to pick up more Irving, which I also enjoyed. Before the novel ended, I almost stopped -- I was so moved that I didn't want the adventure to end. I had fallen in love with Owen Meany, just as so many others have. He was indeed a noble boy. I can only hope that John Irving has some of his characteristics, because he has certainly influenced as many lives as Owen."
5,My favorite novel of all time.,"I've been reading books practically since I was born, and _A Prayer for Owen Meany_ is my favorite. It superceded my previous favorite, _A Tale of Two Cities_, and I believe that anyone who is familiar with the grand fictional talents of Mr. Dickens will find his spiritual successor in Mr. Irving. A true talent of our times."
5,Brilliant!!,"I read this book and was captivated. It must be the best book I have ever read. If you read nothing else-read this book, it cannot fail to have impact and keep you rivited until the last word. Keep the tissues handy!"
5,"Years afterward, STILL an all-time favorite","Whenever I mentally list my all-time favorite books, Owen Meeny is up at the top, and I read it about 8 years ago. Setting Free the Bears, a haunting story, tops the list too.And whenever I list my favorite authors, I can't think of anyone before John Irving. His pace, plots and characters are enchanting. I'd love to meet him."
4,Awesome book,"Outstanding he does it again...his novels never disappoint. Couldn't put it down. He pulls you in with his cast of characters, totally feel like you are there with them."
4,"Great Plot, great characters, above average book","A Prayer for Owen Meany is a very provocative and unique book. The main storyline revolves around a boy named John and his friend Owen Meany. The two are best friends and, throughout the book, witness many miracles. The characters are very well detailed with dynamic personalities. The plot is very addictive although there are some boring parts. The book is very religious and at the same time humorous. My main gripe with the book is the way it is written. Irving jumps through time well explaining the story making it confusing at times. This flaw doesnt take too much away from the book so it earns 4 stars"
5,The Most Wonderful Book I've Ever Read,"I read this book when I was 14 years old. My mother recommended to me. It took me a whole summer. I was reading in the beginning and thinking, ""Why in creation does my mother think this book is so wonderful?"" But then I couldn't put it down because I wanted to figure out exactly what Owen Meany's purpose was and who in the hell was John Wheelwright's daddy. And when I did figure it out, everything fit together. Some details throughout the book seemed out of place, but then it all fit. If you're reading this book, don't skip to the last page. Finish the book. I didn't know how wonderful this book was until I finished the last page. It changed my life."
5,Just can't put into words-You'll have to read it yourself!,"I am finding this review hard to write. There are so many levels to this novel and it covers such a long stretch of time...I enjoyed the struggle of faith that is dealt with throughout the book. Mr. Irving makes a lot of good points about what it is that makes us believe (or not believe) in God. His characters are very believable and well rounded. They grow, they move on.I just can't express what a moving novel this is. I would highly recommend it and enjoyed it thoroughly but there is too much to share and too much I wouldn't want to give away. I have read three other Irving novels and this is by far my favorite."
5,An addictive piece of literature !,"I was sitting in a cafe in Amsterdam when I saw a fellow American reading A Prayer for Owen Meany. Having already read Garp and The Hotel New Hampshire, I felt compelled to engage my fellow American in conversation about this book with the odd sounding title. The Man, whose name I don't recall ( remember, I was in Amsterdam...) told me a friend recommended the book to him with the words "" It was the greatest book I ever read "".It was these words that came back to me as I was in search of a new book to read. I wasn't disappointed. 1 month after reading the book I am still digesting everything Irving encompassed and intertwined into this throughly enjoyable novel. I am looking forward to reading it again and my sincere thanks to my American friend in Amersterdam for the recommendation."
5,I will always remember a boy with a wrecked voice!!,"This is definately the most engaging book I have ever read. Not just the central character but also those characters' whose lives he touches, his view of America and the intricate interweaving plot.Whoever has read this can forget the boy with the wrecked voice born out of the Meany Granite Quarry, his most odd Parents and his pessimistic best friend, Pastor Merrill, and the Wigginses. Tabitha and Dan, Lydia (plus and minus her leg), and of course Harriet Wheelwright.Their are a host of unforgettable caracters whom all deserve a novel of their own but with skill and emotion spanning craft Irving slots them all subservient to the Wonderful Owen Meany.This book has become My Bible over the past seven years. I have read it twice in its entirety but dipped into it many times more just to remind myself of how writing can be truly outstanding. He will never leave my side"
5,I HOPE I NEVER COME ACROSS A BETTER BOOK,"I HAVE READ ""OWEN MEANY"" SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND I TRY TO READ IT IN THE FALL, JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS. I AM A HUGE JOHN IRVING FAN AND WITHOUT DETRACTING FROM HIS OTHER WORK, I HAVE TO SAY THAT ""OWEN MEANY"" IS BY FAR THE MOST RESONANT FOR ME. OWEN IS A CHARACTER THAT BURNS INTO YOU, AND THE ENTIRE BOOK IS LIKE A VAGUE CHILDHOOD MEMORY, RECALLING THE BEST OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE A CHILD. THE ENTIRE BOOK IS SET UP LIKE A FLAWLESS, DELICATE PUZZLE THAT SNAPS INTO PLACE IN THE LAST CHAPTER IN AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL AND SATISFYING WAY. A MOVIE COULD NEVER DO THIS BOOK JUSTICE"
2,Why does everyone love this book?,"I really don't understand it. This book was recommended to me, and I couldn't even finish reading it. It got about a third through it, plodding through it, to see if it would get better. I found it extremely tedious and uninteresting. I was not as impressed with Owen Meany, either - certainly not as much as Irving was."
1,I will never get back this lost time!!,I have read other Irving novels & have greatly enjoyed them. This book was reccomended to me by English teachers at the school where I teach.I hated it. I forced myself to finish it hoping for a punch line or some fantastic ending. Nope - did't get either of these.Worst of all my daughter is having to read it for her English class & all I can do is mentally scream every time I think about it!!
4,A True Irving Classic,"Reading this novel, I didn't know what to think. The characters were very original. Owen Meany was just so courageous and funny. All of the characters had an important part to play to the very end. I didn't think there were any wasted moments, nothing we could do without. That is what I loved about this book. No wasted moments. It is one of his best works yet."
2,An enigma wrapped in a puzzle.,"""A Prayer For Owen Meany,"" despite being better than expected, is a tedious book to read. It is true the book is cynical and fun, but the fun quickly ends. The chapters are long and filled to the brink with random narrations and uninteresting scenes. Though Irving makes a habit of catching the reader's attention with ... innuendo before an abundance of religious allusions, the pattern does not repeat as often as is needed to renew a defeated interest in the book. If the book had an excellent theme or something to that effect, I would still recommend the book (albeit, after much hesitation). However, the novel's theme is difficult to find and many long, dull chapters can be read without any idea of what to analyze. Only in the end of the book is the theme noticible and even then, Irving could have emphasized such a cliche theme from the beginning."
5,"Don't ask, Just Read","There are few books that manage to capsure the sheer scope and beauty that Irving has managed to in A Prayer for Owen Meany. It is not just the story of a boy, John Wheelwright, growing up in a small New England town, or of the remarkable life of his closest friend, THE VOICE, Owen Meany, but of an entire generation coming of age in the post-WWII, Vietnam era.Single-parenthood in the 1950s, religion, baseball, destiny, war; orphans, hippies, armadillos, ""non-practicing homosexuals"" - A Prayer for Owen Meany has the breadth that no other book I have read has. From begining to end, no matter what religion, no matter how many rereadings, this book will make you ask for Owen Meany to be returned."
4,best Irving,"My gf introduced me to the works of John Irving. I started reading Garp, Son of the Circus, etc., and found them moderately interesting and enjoyable. Enough so that I decided to read all his books.Then I read Owen Meany. What a fantastic book! The story and the characters are interesting, engaging, and knowable. I know this may sound trite, but you will be moved by this book, and you will love reading every word of it.I think this should be included in the list of must-reads for high school students. Hell, anyone."
5,"The ultimate in ""early"" Christian songwriting","These lyrics can reach into the most crusty of old souls and speak to the heart. (The music ain't too shabby either.) From ministering to the wayward soul to what I would call the single-greatest ""I want to marry you"" song of all time, this album has it. I have a scratchy old vinly disc that still gets some play time.And no, I'm not kidding, ""Just Like Me"" is the greatest ""I want to marry you"" song of all time. Christain, secular, rock, easy-listening, country, any genre . . . this is simply the best of all time."
2,"God may be necessary, but this book is not","Although Parrish makes a number of excellent points, in the end I found his argument insufficiently compelling. Although, other reviews on this title have been positive I would question the motives of such reviews (Beckwith is a close associate of Parrish's and has co-authored other works). Parrish seems to present the theology as he would like to believe it and then molding his conclusions to that worldview. I would like to see a more neutral and unbiased position explored."
3,Scribbler of Dreams,"I think the book was really outstanding. I have to give thanks to the author for writing the book and putting it in teenage terms. Remeo and Juliet was okay if your understood it but scribbler of dreams made it more thrilling. I like Kaitlin. She's sweet, smart girl and thinks quick in her mind. But kaitlin changed her ways for a boy she fell in love with. Bram is kind but I think he worries what other people think about him especially this family. I can understand and relate to kaitlin, Why she lied to the people she loved to make them happy. Her parents a wonderful parents. They trust kaitlin, but after they found out the truth they still love her and didn't stop her from doing the right thing. I think Bram finally followed his heart when he went back to Kaitlin. And Kaitlin did make a point about the hatred between their families had to stop somehow and why not now!"
2,Bad writing and lame characters make for a bad novel,"I enjoyed this book in the begining, but as read more, I discovered how awful this book truly was. The characters weren't real. They weren't believable. I didn't care what happened to the lead girl. Why was there so much hated between the sisters? It was never explained. The murder wasn't explained thorougly. The hatred between the families seemed lame also. I was not impressed with the book as a whole. I would not recommend it."
5,I highly recommend it.,I highly recommend this book if you are into cheesy but yet gurly-romantic books! Its very good and its one of those books you know that its cheesy but can't help but love it at the same time.
5,"""Scribbler of Dreams""","Mary E. Pearson, author of ""Scribbler of Dreams"", wrote a great book. This book is a drama/romance. ""Scribbler of Dreams"" is a very good book. I would recommend this book to young adults.""Scribbler of Dreams"" is about a girl named Katlin and a boy named Bram. Katlin just moved to her new school and doesn't know anybody, until she meets Bram Crutchfeild. They don't know their families hate each other. They fall in love with each other. But what will happen if Bram finds out who she is? Will they still stay together, or will there hearts get broken? If you want to know, just read ""Scribbler of Dreams"" by Mary E. Pearson."
4,scribbler of dreams,"In this twisted Romeo and Juliet rip off, Kait Malone has to go to school with her long time enemy's the Crutchfields. Generations ago, there was a fight between sisters about a maternity. This splits the sisters apart and sets the families to hate each other generations after. In the present, while going to the Crutchrield school, Kait finds someone worth while-a boy named Bram. The only thing wrong with this boy is he is a Crutchfield. The son of the man her father is in Jail for ""killing."" Once she finds that her dream man is of enemy blood she desperately tries to find ways to keep her real identity a secret. This means she has to tell lie after lie. Is her web of lies going to help her relationship with the boy she loves yet was born to hate."
2,Scribbler of Dreams,"I enjoy reading young adult romances. I purchased this book, feeling very giddy concerning what it was going to be about.I absolutely loathed it. I stopped reading at page 118. I disliked Kaitlin Malone very much so even at the beginning, but I didn't stop reading because I was interested in the story. I should explain why I despised this book, but I don't think Scribbler of Dreams deserves even that much.This is the worst young adult book I have read for many years. Please read What Happened to Lani Garver, it is nearly perfect."
2,Slow from the go,"Have u ever read a book that makes you want to jump to the ending because the other parts are about to make u fall asleep. Ms. pearson is spending to much time on the fact that the 2 families hate each other. it is like droning on and on. Where is the point. Yea i know that they are obviously in love,(bram and kait) but me ( i am even a romantic) can't wait until the end of the book. But all in all the end was pretty good."
5,scribbler of dreams,"wow, this book was great! one of my new favorites! if you haven't checked it out you should. it's a story of two teenagers in love...one with a secret of her true identity. this book shows you how a hateful past can try to keep anything apart. i read this book in a few hours tops! i just couldn't keep my eyes off of it. i wish there were a sequel!"
5,Read It,You know those books that you read in like 2 days and almost cry when its over. This is one of those books. You can read it a million times and still love it as much as you did the first. I urge you to read this book
3,This Book Rox!,"I could relate to this character...i laughed, cried, it was really really good!You seriously have to read this book"
3,"great miles, band, tunes, sometimes lousy mix","This is the first of 2 cds [made] from an audience tape at Miles' ""last recorded concert"" (Avignon, France). I've seen it with a couple of different names & covers. For the first couple of numbers the synthesizers are obnxiously loud, drowning out the excellent trumpet, sax & guitar solos. The band contains Foley, Daryl Jones, Kenny Garrett, Ricky Wellman, Adam Holzman. The sound quality is better on Live Around the World, which has most of these tunes, albeit with some differences in personnel."
2,poor quality,"Album doesn't deserve high rating shown with listing. Poor quality listening: lots of static and surface noise. Too much audience applause (live recording). Cracked album casing. After one playing I threw album away. Waste of money and time. This was first bum order received from Amazon. Will never order ""used"" product again."
5,"Beautifully sung, played and recorded..","Beautifully sung, played and recorded. Listen to the sample tracks and you'll see. This is from the late sixtes, the golden age of Baroque recordings led by Karl Richter. It has all the spontaneity and verve of the best period instrument recordings with a richer sound. To my ear Troyanos outshines Janet Baker in her famous recording of Dido and Aeneas."
2,disappointing,"i purchased a 12v hitachi impact a few years ago and i was very impressed. the impact is extremely durable and very reliable. i bought this combo kit expecting the same thing....wrong! the reciprocating saw lost the blade lock after a few uses and then the foot falls off of it. the light is junk and the drill is adequate. the circular saw does well and is probably the best performer in the kit. these tools are not built anywhere near the quality of my impact. it's as if hitachi made a ""cheap"" bunch of tools to make a kit with. maybe the kit is fine with part time home owner work...VERY part time. if you use these tools on a daily or even weekly basis...try looking elsewhere"
3,"not bad, but not what I expected","Having listened to all three compilation CDs (Babylon 5, messages from Earth and Best of Babylon 5), I find this one to be my least favorite. The 'Best of B-5' cd I think gives one a better taste of the episodic music and themes, while this one feels disconnected and almost random, considering the titles used for the suite tracks. I did not get a feel for any season's theme from listening to these tracks."
5,Wonderfull,"I love the show, I love the music, I love it all but this was excellent. Christopher Franke is good and I hope to hear him elsewhere. Its a shame he isn't doing Crusade."
1,Disappointing: Slow and Obtuse,"I downloaded this book after a particularly dense month of downloads since it was free. Well, it was free because it was very slow. After a promising start, the plot grinded to a turtlelike pace. Formatting is awful with capitailized roman numerals serving as partitions in the chapters. I was constantly reminding myself that this was Victorian British Scifi. The wording is very indirect, characters have formal names, and considerations for ""nicities"" and ""social considerations"" dominat the text. It's a minor work of H G Wells because it isn't great."
1,confusing,The charaters were hard to follow and the story jumped around to much. I could not finish it. Removed from my kindle 1/4 way through.
3,You get what you are waiting for,"The LMB-3 is what you are buying: a compressor/enhancer. You see tons of youtube videos and read a lot, but don't expect more than what a compressor will do. No magic is done on tone. It will not work properly on guitars - so don't even creat the expectation. It is great if you are only using it as a pedal that has a trigger based on level. If you are playing with distorsion, this pedal might not be worth it. I had it chained with a '59 bassman pedal, and they just don't do it.Still, great if you wanna play a clean, straight to the amp bass."
1,This is not a pilates dvd to spend your $ on....,"I am use to a choreographed pilates dvd or class and based on the fact that this instructor is the ""first lady of pilates"", I expected it to be a great DVD. The instructor walks through every motion and they do about 2 body band motions and then move on to the next. It is a constant stop and start. This has nothing to do with body sculpting. It may be more of a stretch tape for a 200 year old women but for this being a 3 on a scale of 5 for difficulty, I expected a lot more. I would never recommend this DVD."
2,"Good Lesson, Bad Workout","This is a great DVD if you want a full Pilates lesson. It goes into proper posture and alignment like pilates should. However, if you are like me, and have carved a precious hour out of your morning to get some exercise done, you don't want to spend twenty of those minutes on a 'warmup' which is really a lesson on alignment and doesn't actually warm you up. If you want to take your evenings and dive into the world of Pilates, this is your video. If you actually want to exercise, pick something else."
2,War War War,"If you expected something romantic, forget it. It's pure bloody war war. If there is a deep message behind the story, I did not find it. Better choose Madame Bovary."
3,Not too wild,"I didn't dislike the book. And in retrospect, there were some well-created scenes. But a lot of it is flowery language that doesn't really move a plot. So in short, very vivid background and characters, not a whole lot of interaction. If you're looking for excellent French literature that is both descriptive in detail and maintains momentum in prose, you're best off with Dumas."
5,48 int'l residences in color photos,"48 international houses and apartments located in the city, beach, mountains, countryside in hundreds of color photos of the best possible quality showing used materials. All houses are evenly spread between 7 chapters, one of which is separately emphasizing utilizing concrete, stone, brick, metal, wood, light, and recycled materials. The text is minimal, and there is a very few small plans, elevations, sections, and a site plan. The modernistic style and derivatives, and rather warm to hot climates dominate, but there are a few more traditional houses, and a cooler climate is represented as well. The design is excellent."
5,Perfect,"I love this hat! I got it for my bachelorette party, I had a Kentucky Derby themed outing, and it was such a perfect hat, the brown is a great brown and the rim is not a stiff rim, it seemed to have a wire or something in the outer rim so that you can ""mold it"" which was nice because you can shaped it the way you wanted."
4,Looks Good,"Protects your balls. Looks good,especially if you have a black truck. Would def recommend to a friend. Durable enough to last a long time it seems."
4,Needs only a slight modification to make it great,"It is VERY tight over a 2"" ball. It slips on easy, but the vacuum it creates coming off makes it very difficult to remove. You can eliminate the vacuum effect by taking a power drill with a very small bit and putting a couple small holes in the side right near the top...this allows air to come in when taking it off and it comes off as easy as it goes on! I fought with it for months until the light bulb went off and I drilled the holes. With this minor modification it works great. Don't know why the manufacturer has never thought of it!"
5,As Described,It is nice. And it is cheap. I am happy with my purchase of this item. This is what I was looking for.
1,Total Failure,"Not sure if the center section will fit the advertised 2"" hitch ball. Plastic used has very little give, and this unit will not stretch over the ball. Can't press down on it to install, as it just collapses. Old tennis ball is much better."
1,Netgear has not honored their rebate offer.,"I purchased this switch when Netgear was offering a free ipod nano as a rebate. More than two months after submitting my rebate and having it approved, Netgear has still not sent my rebate. I have sent multiple emails and tried to call NetGear and the rebate center directly, but still the rebate has not arrived as promised. Therefore I cannot recommend any product from Netgear as the company does not honor its own terms and conditions.I am sure the switch itself is very nice, but the company has shady rebate practices."
3,Interesting.....,"Listened to this album and felt relaxed. If I had to compare the sound to any other bands I am familiar with, Porcupine Tree comes to mind. The first three tracks comprise one 40 minute song. Last track ends around 10 minutes into it, a few minutes of silence, then some more hidden tunage to round out this release."
3,"Nice, but ...","I bought this because I like to travel on trains in foreign countries. I enjoyed this DVD when they focused on trains, and the life around train stations, and the quick excursions into the surrounding areas. Unfortunately, at least 1/3 of the DVD focused on visits to wineries (port and sherry). If you're a fan of wineries, then this DVD is for you. If you're just a fan of train journeys in a foreign land, you'll wonder why they spend so much time on wineries."
3,not as hard as the first one,Good listen tho. It depends what you're looking for. I bought the first one and I loved it. This one isnt nearly as hard but sounds ok
2,An Encyclopaedia of Murder,"Just what it claims to be, there is not much to this book. It is a catalog of a large number of murders, most of which are not particularly unusual or interesting. I found it rather dull, but it's OK if you like cheap thrills."
1,not really for small birds,the item which I received looks nothing like the picture. The branch which I got instead looks exactly like the 18in branch which is also sold by this company although the branch which I received is 12in as advertised. Unfortunately because the branch is so wide around and smooth my parakeet will not even set foot on it which makes it a big waste of money.
3,:|,"The last of the Diamond siblings is getting married. Piper has always had a crush on Kyle Masters, but he flat out refused and humiliated her the last time they seen each other. Now years later Piper returns pregnant and scared. The father of her child is gone and his parents want her baby. Her lawyer suggests that she have a marriage of convience. The only person that Piper thinks to ask is the now divorced father Kyle. Kyle had a hard enough time walking away from young Piper all those years ago, and the thought of her marrying anyone else made him see red. Kyle and Piper decide on a marriage of convience, but what they both want is a real marriage. But, will they admit it before its to late?This series held little excitement for me. I found that the stories held a lot of potential, but rarely lived up to it. I have found it disappointing that in all three stories the characters only admit their feelings in the last couple of pages. This leaves me wondering what happens next."
4,"Not perfect, but good collection","This book contains examples of Silverberg's early work, much of it from the '50s and early '60s. As such, many of the stories lack the depth and richness of his later work, but there are some real gems in here, the best being ""Neighbor"", ""Counterpart"", ""The Fangs of the Trees"", and especially the novelette ""How It Was When the Past Went Away.""Recommended for those wanting some background on Siliverberg's early short work."
2,not so good,It was just too soft. I like the stuff that the Chili Peppers did that was more like funk or alternative or a combination. This sounded almost like classical music at some times.
5,"The journey to the west, volume1","This is a very great story, not just this volume, I really recommend these books to be read by anyone it has everything that a great -great story need.Prepare yourself for a great journey...read the story."
4,Good translation,"Yu's translation is quite good, though I prefer the comic edge Arthur Weylan gives the story. Interestingly enough, Monkey does not eat a peach of immortality, but rather gains immortality from a guru, after which he destroys a peach banquet in heaven. Nor is his quest really a punishment (that is all a very western slant on the story) but an act of karma AFTER his imprisonment. The story, attributed to Wu Cheng-en, is quite hilarious on the surface, full of creatures, jokes and foibles, and on the other hand it is a deeply religious plot. This is the finest piece of Chinese literature I've come across."
4,Simply read or study the history as well.,"Although I did not find it as ""easy"" a read as I had expected,one has the sense of getting as much of the original flavor as possiblefrom a translation.For history and background, the introduction is longerthan some chapters! There are also ample footnoteswith plenty of information."
5,The only bandaid you should own--if you can find them!,"I can't believe these are so hard to find. It is the most sensible bandaid product out there. One of the adhesive sides is twice as long--so you can wrap it around your finger and it actually STAYS ON! Instead of using two bandaids, the second to make sure the first one stays on, you use one. I have a box of these in the kitchen (where you need them most often) and in the First Aid Kit. But no one seems to carry Curad products in retail stores. WHY NOT????"
1,Right Wing Propaganda Disguised as Scholarship,"I just finished ""A Students Guide to Philosophy"" by Ralph McInerny and what a disappointment! I wish I would have checked the publishers website ([...]) before I opened this book. This book is a thinly guised attempt to pedal right wing propaganda. The tip off is section entitlked, ""Fact/Value Split"" where the author refers to ""infamous Kennedy decision"", referring to Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's decision on abortion. I should have stopped reading there, but once I start a book I finish it through. The book puports to be a ""Students Guide"", but it is nothing of the sort. It is fraudulently trying to pass itself off as an academic book. Don't waste your time reading this trash, pick up Will Durant's ""The Story of Philosophy"" instead."
2,West Point Stevens Rockport Full Bed in a Bag,"You get what you paid for. Nice pattern, but the bedding is somewhat rough to the touch. Wouldn't give it as a gift."
3,Not bad for the price,"it's only 190 thread count so it's not very soft at all. but I wasn't really expecting much since it was only $19.99 for the whole set. It does look pretty nice on the bed though, just not that soft. Might be perfect for that extra bedroom... if you don't mind your guests sleeping on sheets with 190-thread count."
5,west point stevens full bed in a bag,good product. amazon again showed that no one can beat its price. i got it for $19.99 (which included S&H as i bought items worth of >$25).
4,Great deal for the price.,"I actually bought this set from Walmart. I thought it looked nice, and I love blue and the pattern is very unisex, so my husband didn't complain. I agree with the previous reviewers about the quality of the fabric not being ""luxury"", but it was fine by me. Our baby slept in the bed with us, so with the drool, leaky diapers and spit up, I'm not trying to have something that I'm going to weep over because it has an unremovable stain on it. It does fade slightly with washings. Nice for the money."
4,Great item at the best price...it's really a gift !,"I am from the MERCOSUR area, from URUGUAY. My wife received this as a gift from a friend in the US. He bought it into the US because it's not selling to us. Really teh quality es very good, good packaging, and a perfect colour and design. My friend buy the item a the initial price of US 19.90 !!!...ooohhh it's a gift really !!. My wife had been receiving congratulations for the great gift and the quality..and when she told to her friends the price...ooopsss all want to buy it !!.Thanks Amazon....and our friend Oscar. We really recommend you to buy NOW !!..before than the price should be more expensive."
1,It's no bargain....,"...when you get what you pay for. The thread count is minimal and the sheets are VERY rough to the touch. While the dust ruffle, itself, is made of the same sheet fabric, the portion that goes between the mattress is little more than sizing and ripped in my hand as I put it on (and I have poor upper arm strength.) The sheet pattern is not woven in but painted on so, while it looks good out of the bag, don't expect that to last beyond many washings.If you're on a tight budget and you're looking for temporary bed linens for a few months then here you go. Otherwise, don't insult your guests, or your pocketbook, with it."
3,Incorrect Product Image,"The image shown for this product does not match with the product being sold. The image is for HP DVD+R 16X. However, the product is actually 8X. So, ensure you are buying the correct product you need based on the description, not the image."
1,Don't waste your time...,"... The packaging is very deceptive on this issue, and you've got to read very closely on the inside flap (one phrase, in parenthesis, and small print) to discover that despite at least 11 references to MP3's plastered all over the box, you can't really do anything useful to your MP3's with this software if you want to still listen to them as MP3's. Consider this stetement, in large white type one the front: ""Digitize and enhance audio from LP's, CD's, cassettes, MP3's, etc."" or this statement on the back: ""Vinyls, cassettes, MP3 files, and your favorite CD tracks - MAGIX music cleaning lab 3.0 automatically makes everything shine."" ..."
2,"Recording not bad, but has it's problems...","I recorded a cassette to put onto CD and the recording was quite good but I had endless problems trying to burn the stuff to CD. When I downloaded the Magix 'CD Profiler' their web site has to help with this, it completely crashed my computer and I had to pull out my recovery disks and lost everything on my C drive.Needs a little more work to make it professional I think..."
1,Magixal Deception Probably,"I'm surprised that [it] would advertise this product as being able to encode MP3.In fact the program will encode MP3 for 20 times. After that, the purchaser must spend $14.95 to unlock the encoding capability.[It] should mention this additional charge to prospective purchasers."
3,audio cleaning lab,"most mp3 cleaning software you will find the limitation on converting too mp3 format is common, as I have a simular software on my computer. the customers purchasing mp3 software need to get a convertion software first, can be found on a shareware file site."
3,PSU Tester,"This product is only a 20pin tester not 24 as advertised, it works well on the 20pin PSUs."
3,warning track,"Having grown up in Boston, I think Corrigan accurately describes the ball clubs' attitudes towards each other. As a fan, I enjoyed reading about the inside stuff. Good read."
3,A student opinion,"The value of Narveson's text is held primarily in his ability to raise relevant, precise questions regarding moral matters. This is a reader friendly account of the libertarian perspective of ethics which allows for easy transitions from premise to conclusion. Chapter one is especially conducive to the understanding of the nature of ethics by readers new to the field. However, at times his arguments lack the force of persuation and leave the reader left with only a vague idea of his libertarian point of view. It seems this book could be strengthened if, having once been a utilitarian himself, Narveson would offer more consideration of the consequentialist perspective while defending his contractualist claims. Despite these problems, this is a book worth reading. At worst, it forces opponents to libertarian thought to rethink their own philosophical grounding. That sort of thought is exactly what philosophy is all about!"
4,Doll is NOT included,"I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas this year along with a set of clothes. The picture looks as if there is a doll. I read the description. Much to my dismay, on Dec. 23 I discovered that the ""doll"" is a cardboard cutout! Looking back I see that it says that the doll and clothes are sold separately way down at the very last line after weight and dimensions and such. My daughter-in-law when out on Christmas Eve and bought a doll so my granddaughter would be able to play with the set. The product description is poorly written but the toy itself is nice. My granddaughter really likes it."
4,Snap 'n Style Fashion Wardrobe,Snap N' Style Fashion Wardrobe- I bought this item for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! I also got her one of the dolls and one of the dogs. She has fun putting them in front of the mirror after she dresses them.
2,Disappointed at Christmas,"As one other reviewer mentioned, the description of this item is very poor and the additional product pictures are misleading -- I expected I would get a doll and some clothes when I received this item. Fortunately, my daughter is two and didn't complain too much on Christmas Day though I was absolutely fuming (mostly at myself for not checking it more thoroughly).This product is sturdy and seems like it would be fun to play with - IF ANY STORES SOLD THE DOLLS OR CLOTHES. I've done numerous web searches for Snap 'N Style products with no results... I certainly didn't realize the accompanying dolls and clothes would be so hard to find! The Fisher Price website claims more dolls will be available for sale on 2/15/07; maybe my daughter will be lucky enough to get some before her birthday at the end of February. :("
1,This IS NOT The Mystic Moods Orchestra,"Another ""jump on the bandwagon"" studio creation with nature sounds as background. A blantant attempt to confuse by using ""Mystic Moods"" on the cover."
2,"Weak, unaccomplished CD - disappointing","I bought this CD on the recommendation from another reviewer, citing that it was better than the two latest CDs from Badly Drawn Boy and Coldplay. He was wrong. The CD is nothing to write home about. There are about three decent tracks on it, but many of the other tracks are not even average - they're unlistenable - I simply have to hit the skip button on several tracks. ColdPlay's Parachutes CD is, on the other hand, brilliant. It is a gem of a CD, in a completely different league. Badly Drawn Boy's CD called ""Hour of Bewilderment"" is also good but is a bit more unorthodox and obscure - still some good tunes there though. Another one to consider in a similar style is David Gray's White Ladder."
2,"all production, no songs","Let me first say that I really wanted to like this cd. In fact, I gave it more spins than it deserves. I keep hearing comparisons to Sparklehorse and Mercury Rev, but those records have some emotion and brilliant songs. There's absolutely nothing engaging on this cd, it's like having your housemate strum the guitar while you're watching television. Since the only interesting thing on this record is the sound of the record, than it may be a good dish washing soundtrack, but nothing more."
4,A fine pop album !,"Wheat did a really fine pop album with ""hope and adams"". It's not loud, violent music but quiet and well done pop music with many interesting moments. Not mainstream but music with lots of ideas. I like it !"
3,Complete Chess Player - Reinfeld,"This book relies mostly on specific examples of game situations that seem frankly unlikely to occur very often. The book falls short when it comes to teaching principles and general information that can be used over and over in many situations. When I was a beginner, I learned a lot more from Fred Reinfeld's book ""How To Be A Winner at Chess."""
4,Complete Chess Player,"A very good book for the beginning chess player. Mr. Reinfeld covers all the important aspects of the game, although nobody could really become a Master overnight with just this book. It takes years and years of study and practice to become proficient in the game of chess (given that one has the aptitude and time, of course).For kids starting out learning chess, I would say this book is an essential one in his or her chess book library."
4,dougv,"A useful book. The best chapters are: Tactics, Basic Endgames, and the lastchapter with sample games--excellent games to help you.One reviewer said the author's book entitled ""How to Be a Winner at Chess"" is aa better book. I disagree. That book has almost all general comments that anyonepast the beginner stage would already know.A book not worth buying."
4,Wierd Stuff...this has never happened to me before!,"Disc 1 was great! Love the Chi-town house, even though it is played in L.A. Hard beats coupled with sick vocals the only way it gets better than that is hearing it live! Here is the wierd part, and if this didn't happen this album would have received 5 stars.... I put disc 2 in and it was classical music by Totto Fellini. Why, I have no idea! I have purchased many cd's in my time and this has never happened! If you like this cd you have to get DJ Shog ""My Sound""...the best cd I have heard in a long time!!!!!!!! I wouldn't lead you wrong."
5,DJ Rockstar!!!,Well i was supose to go to this event and missed out .. but not really after i bought this album. First CD is Classic Irene with a Trance Twist. The Second CD DJ Irene Shows her True Rockstar style... Mixed in with Hard House Beats .. she Keeps you on your Toes wanting more ... This an Awsome album .. packed full of energy.. there are a couple little offbeat moments .. but very slight and still an Awsome Live performance and a great live reconding ... if your a DJ irene fan i would added to your collection..
3,Optio X: Strange but interesting Camera,"The Optio X has two halves: One side containing the lens, Flash< Processor, 14mb of memory, The other half has all the controls, two inch LCD, Battery and SD Slot. Both sides are constructed from stylish black and silver metal panels and are extremely thin. they are linked by a central spine that enables them to rotate through 270 degrees. So when it comes to the cool factor i say it really looks great, especially when rotated to 180 degrees.The Optio X is anything but fast, The burst shooting mode is extremely slow and when switched to movie mode it flickers at an irritating 15fps. The good part is that it does its work as a camera, you can take decent pictures with this. So if you are looking for a useful and unusual camera this Pentax X is for you."
4,extremely expensive,"Bij error I filled the box ""I owne it"" but I do not own it, but I couldn't remove the click.I very much like to own this DVD but the price of buying it through ""these sellers"" is outragious.I looked for the price at other sources and these were much lower, allthough still high enough for a DVD-R with not even subtitles. The price at TCM was $ 17.99 and at Warner Archive itself was $ 19.95. The price at ""these sellers"" was almost $ 40.=. But for customers overseas it is impossible to buy at TCM or Warner Archives and ""these sellers"" make abuse of this. I know if Amazon is offering it itself it still is higher in price than with Warner Archives but at least $ 10.= cheaper than ""these sellers"". Well, I hope someone at Amazon will take notice of this and start offering the DVD because at a price of nearly $ 40.= I feel swindled. This problem does arise often with this series unless Amazon is offering them in their own programme.Ad de KoningHolland"
4,charming old fashioned musical,"This is a charming old fasioned musical, and if you enjoy that sort of movie, you will love this one. Gordon MacRae, Gene Nelson & June Haver make a lovely team and song and dance stars. What a pity that they don't make movies like this anymore - corny jokes, lovely music & dancing, and a sweet romance. Buy it if you are tired of all the sex and violence seems to be all that is served up today."
3,The Daughter of Rosie O'Grady,"I have the musical, ""The Daughter of Rosie O'Grady"" with June Haver and Gordon MacRae. Most of the scenes were with June, her sisters and father primarily. Gene Nelson took a good bit of the credit, too, making the musical into a continuous Vaudeville-type show. Gordon only had a few spots to sing, which I was disappointed in except for the lovely ""The Rose of Tralee,"" accompanying himself on the piano, and for the title song. My impression was that Warner Brothers Studio was trying to promote June Haver. It would have been a far superior and memorable musical with more of Gordon's magnificent voice and musical ability."
4,I've used Osteo Bi-Flex supplement as a preventative ...,I've used Osteo Bi-Flex supplement as a preventative measure for healthy joints and cartilage regeneration. Normally it takes four to six weeks to notice any changes. The softgels are easy to swallow and you take three daily with meals. After 60 days you can take between one and three. The most disappointing thing about this product is the expense -- $40.00 for a month's supply!
3,"I can't tell a difference yet, but have ...","I can't tell a difference yet, but have been taking them and hopefully in about another week they'll be in my system. So far, though, I have no problems with them."
4,This product is difficult to rate since the ...,"This product is difficult to rate since the effects take some time. I haven't noticed any difference yet. The gel caps are nice but it takes three gel caps per dose so a bottle lasts only 2 1/2 weeks. Could get expensive after awhile, but it seems like a worthwhile product if you've explored other medical avenues and your MD concurs with the use."
5,southern fried chicks,this cd was tremendously funny and made my day I bought two more and sent them to my mom and mom in law for Christmas!
4,Great Fun - but for Adults Only!,"Hilarious performances from all of these semi-Southern women, but this is NOT family material!DON'T include Grandma or the kids when viewing this, as you're all likely to blush during certain portions!A great hour of hilarity for the grown-ups!"
4,Does exactly what I needed it to do with expected product quality,"I use the LS-2 to switch between line to amp and line loop through my mixer board which is bounded by DI box input and Re-amp output. This lets me mix switch line and easily add in any instrument, mic, computer, or any other inputs from my mixer. Makes for a very versatile setup. Added gain level controls on both lines are very handy when adjusting to maximize volume and sound of my various pedals and to keep volume even when switching from amp to mixer. Switching is silent and product is solid as should be expected with a boss product and price."
4,Hawkwind - 'Hawklords Live' (Griffin),"One thing I've always got a charge out of is the way that bands SOMETIMES briefly change their name.In this case,it's Hawkwind to Hawklords;I liked it even MORE so on 'Dawn Of Hawkwind'(see my review on that CD)when they were once the Hawkwind Zoo.ENOUGH!!Hawkwind IS HAWKWIND!!'Hawklords Live' is a decent six song set from a 1978 gig,a time when the band did a U.S. tour,but from what I heard,they usually played in small clubs,vacated skating arena(s) and just about any dive that would have them.Apparently,Dave Brock and frontman(1976-78)Bob Calvert were the only two HW members that survived the numerous line-up changes at the point of when this record was cut.Overall,it's got a good production intact.The best two tracks are the hard-hitting version of ""Death Trap"" and ""Spirit Of The Age"".A decent title of the group's extentive repertoire,but more 'space pop' than space rock."
1,Do Not Buy this Version,"Do not buy the 1992 version of this Hawklords gig. Atomhenge have done a wonderful job at remixing, remastering, redesigning, and adding additional tracks to this album; and the new 2009 version is superior in every way.Live '78Live '78PS the one star is for the edition, not the music."
5,Jedi Quest #1:The Way Of The Apprentice,"This book is a spectacular work of art.The depth at which Watson explores and explains the characters makes you feel as if you really know them.She goes along with the whole Jedi teachings,and the Masters and Padawans have just the right serene Jedi attitudes.There is a perfect dose of humor and plenty of suspence.The characters are well formed,and the small signs of Anakin's eventual destiny are scattered throughout.The way she explains the Jedi's actions and lives is very well done,and she shares the thoughts not only going through Anakin's mind,but through the Obi-Wans as well,so you realize that he often doubtfull of his own ability to be the master.I all in all loved this book,and can't wait to read the others."
3,no title,i think that this was an ok book i mean it was good but like some of the other people said Anakin is very anoying and the whole book is practically about him. i really miss th jedi apprentice series because they were well written and i am not saying that these aren't but if u asked me to say something about this book i waould say i might be done with this series and go back and reread the Jedi Apprentice sereis. i hope that those of you who read the book already agree but this was not a great book
2,Star Wars Jedi Quest,The Star Wars Jedi Quest was a book about a boy name Anakin Skywalker being train to be a Jedi by his master Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin Skywalker met a girl name Flora. Anakin had to fight off bounty hunters who were after him and Flora. There were a lot of space battles. I would not recommend this book because some people were killed in the space battles.
1,i hated the cover,This book was terrible. mostly because of the kid on the front not anikan but the other kid on the right of him was making me soo angry.one thing i really hate about this book is that that stupid kid isnt in the story getting his head saberd off and if that did happen i would be like YEA! i always see his stupid face everytime i read this book. i suggest in the next book they dont use that kid and if they do make his head get choped off and all the jedis poop on his dead bodie i would laugh soo hard. and i would read the book 3 times. if u see this kid walking donwn the street kick him for me. thank u for listening dont buy this book inless u want to get really angry.
4,"A New World, New Problems","I really liked the first book from this series but this story, although well written and likeable, is a step down in the excitement level and depth of story found in Book 1."
3,Way to Predectable,This book was a good read if not way to predectable. It seems Jude is stuck with no new stories. The last of the Jedi Apprentice series was the same way. It seems they get sent to some planet in trouble and the problems are all basically the same. You can also spot the bad guys miles away. My suggestion is Jude needs to take a break. Get some new ideas and different plots. Still it was not to bad.
5,As good as Jedi Quest #1!,"I also bought this book with Jedi Quest #1. As soon as I finished #1 I immediately started on #2. In THE TRAIL OF THE JEDI, Anakin is worring why Obi-Wan isn't open with him. Obi-Wan wonders if he'll ever be as good a master as Qui-Gon Jinn. The book starts out as a training exercise for Anakin as Obi-Wan supervises. Things become dangerous as the the exercise starts going wrong. Soon enough they find out there is a squad of infamous Bounty-hunters trying to capture them. This story sets the foundation for a story arc. You have got pick this up before #3 and over get a chance to be released."
1,bring back qui-gon and obi-wan!!!,"First, I loved Jedi Apprentice and was heart-broken when Jude finished. I even liked the hardcover Jedi Quest. These books stank, Anakin is a brat who deserves to be smacked by Yoda a bit. Obi-Wan seems to have lost the humor he had in JA. There is not enough of Obi-Wan, there are about five chapters in his POV. The Shattered Peace was more exciting than both the books combined. You could see the villain a mile away in #1. The cliffhanger in #2 was pointless, Granta is no Xanatos, who made a great asset to several of the JA. I'm not even pining for the next book, like back in the days of JA. Jude, Bring Back Jedi Apprentice!!!!!!!"
4,A Mission of Padawans and Their Masters,"When a team of 4 padawans/masters are sent to a planet they are split up.Half of the planet has toxin.This is where the masters go.The clear sector is where the padawans go.Both the masters and padawans find out important clues and when they are rejoined they put the clues together to find out who did it,what he did, where he did it, when he did it, why he did it, and how he did it.I enjoyed this book because of the suspence."
5,Spic-n-Span Glass Cleaner,"Have used this product for a year or two. Excellent glass cleaner for windows, glass (vision),car windows, etc. This product for glass cleaning is the best I've ever used--no streaking etc. Recommend this product highly. Hope this encourages you to try it."
2,Nice Try,"I have owned this mixer for over a year now and have experienced the following:Audio bleed from the mic channels. I can hear a thump if I tap my mic while the mic volume is at ZERO!One channel of the master output is no longer putting out a clear sound. Not sure when this started but I have switched to using the zone outputs for now.The quality of the mic channels is not great to begin with. Turn the mic bass down to zero and you still sound like Barry White!On the plus side, there are lots of attractive bells and whistles on the board- 3 mic inputs, lighted fader displays, etc.From my experience, the durability and quality are not what I had hoped for."
4,Excellent presentation of music for healing,"Susan Mazer and Dallas Smith are musicians who have gifts for music in words as well as in playing their instruments - reflecting a healing presence through the instruments of their personhood.Each speaks for her/himself, creating a pleasant discourse, stimulating tension of similarities and differences, and harmony in their coming together to share their explorations of bringing music as healing into medical environments that ordinarily are stressful and anything but healing.Mazer and Smith describe how they birthed and are maturing their skills in using music in hospital and other healthcare settings.Excellent presentation of music for healing. The authors are sensitive to the healing qualities of the instrument that is the musician - through which the music flows. Reading the book is a healing experience in itself."
4,"First a classic heist film, then a clever romantic comedy.","Gambit is a marvelous film full of style as well as substance. Much as I'd like to discuss the plot, I dare not because much of the film's special surprises stem directly from telling the plot. So just trust me when I say grab it- if for no other reason the exotic locales, Shirley MacLaine's beauty, charm, and smarts (not to mention the stunning wardrobe by costumer Jean Louis), and the fun interplay between MacLaine, relative newcomer Michael Caine, and the urbane and charming Herbert Lom. A perfect film for the Sunday afternoon you're not going anywhere."
2,very dated,Hating this movie is too strong a word to use to describe a reaction to a piece of 60s fluff.
3,While the acting is really quite good,"(Well, at least for the top 3 cast members; the others range from OK to just stinko in a few cases), the setting interesting, the plot intriguing, the direction fairly smooth and a few twists at least partially unexpected, Gambit is enjoyable as a story, but never really progresses past a certain point as a caper comedy. Something in it just doesn't jell, and it's tough to say exactly what. But the viewer has a feeling of something being missing. Any ideas?"
1,??????????????????,"I am pleased to see all of these hard to find films here on Amazon, however befor I buy, are they Widescreen or Pan and Scan and how is the transfer quality? I think these questions need to be addressed befor Amazon will start to sell a high volume of these ""Vault Series"" films. Please Amazon, more info!!! Untill them 1 star rate because I have heard negative reviews about other ""Vault Series"" transfers. I'm ready to purchace many of these!Thank You Amazon!"
1,Couldn't watch it so this isn't really a review.,I received this DVD yesterday and while I'm sure I'd seen it many years ago I was looking forward to watching it again. The disc wouldn't play in any of my DVD players(5) scattered around the house. I sent it back for a refund rather than a replacement to avoid dealing with another possibly defective disc and another trip to the UPS store to return it again. I guess I'll have to appreciate Gambit from memory.
5,Shirley MacLaine was very astute when she chose Micheal Caine to be her leading man,"This movie is charming as any romantic comedy about a 'caper,' as they used to refer to heists back then. What a wonderful screenplay that very clearly shows the male animal planning everything perfectly in his head, down to the nth degree according to how he believes it will happen, a perfect heist, and then 'Reality' shows up as a real life character. This movie illustrates how men and women humourously complement each other when faced with the random disorder of life. A twinkling gem in the history of film, worth adding to your library."
5,ONE OF THE '60S BEST,"Out of so many annoying films made in the mid '60s, this one, which I saw ""new"" as a child was one of a handful of positive showstoppers. Cast: perfect. The VHS version is quite fine quality."
3,Gambit,"I remember this film from TV when it was shown and it was a fun movie. I had thought I finally found a DVD. Unfortunately, this DVD doesn't have closed captioning listed on the cover which normally I look for in the descriptions but I must have missed it. So, I was anxious to get this film that I forgot to do the examination for closed captioning or subtitles in English. I will use this as a gift for someone else."
1,Olay Regenerist Derma-Pod Eye System,"No improvement at all using this product. I'd expected some reduction of under eye puffiness or less visible lines, but there was no difference after 8 weeks. I am disappointed."
1,Over priced.,I did not like this product at all. The sponge applicator was really scratchy. The sponge felt like it was leaving microscopic scratches on my skin which was probably why the eye area had a burning/stinging sensation after the application of the cream. I don't think that the thin skin under the eye should be rubbed anyway. I saw no difference in the puffiness or brightness in the under-eye area. At a buck a pod this was a total waste of money.
2,The Cost is for the Packaging,"This seems to be the same type of serum often sold in tiny tubes. For the money, I'd rather have the tube. I can figure out how to put a drop or two on my skin without the expensive ""delivery system"". Most of the money seems to go to the elaborate packaging, sponge system to apply the serum. What a waste! You can't even tell how much gets on because so much is left in the sponge. Plus, the sponge is quite rough for the eye area. I don't think this whole idea was thought completely through. Spend your money on the tiny tubes made for the eye area. This probably sounded a lot better than it turned out."
2,Olay Derma-Pod...Not very impressed!,"I'm an Olay Pro-X user, and from time to time, I try some of Olay's other products. This is actually one of their products that I felt just wasn't that great. I gave it 2 stars for effort only. My reviews on other Olay Products are usually rated 4 to 5 stars...mostly 5 stars, but to be fair I just could not give this product a good-rating. It really didn't do anything for me, and I never saw any real difference. I like my Olay Pro-X line, and that product line-up is 5 stars +!!! Nice try Olay, but this product is beneath you. Maybe it will work differently for someone else, but it didn't do me justice."
2,Keep your expectations low.,"For those of you who inherited puffy eyes or dark circles, please disregard any positive reviews above. This item, while it probably is a decent moisturizer, does not improve or remove the puffy or dark area below the eyes.Every now and again, I get the wild idea to buy one of these products with hopes that it will improve the appearance of the puffy dark area under my eyes. Like my experience with other products, this does not make any notable change.Do yourself a favor and buy ""The Perfect Sit Up"" or similar. Place your focus on another part of your body. We're stuck with these eyes."
3,"It works, but nutritional supplementation is required for signifant lymphatic swelling","I give it a 3 although I was pleasantly surprised that it does work - a little. I do see a noticable affect, and figure that for a normal body without much of a problem it may be all that is required. However, I have had lymphatic issues for a long time, plus at this point, I may have a little inflammation. Lately I have not taken mullein, lobelia and chickweed herbs for the problem, so I plan to order that plus another triple-action product from [...] that another comment mentioned. I will use either that one or continue to use the Olay Regenerist Derma-Pods, whichever works best. If buying this product, I suggest BUY THE BOX OF 48 INSTEAD for significant savings!"
5,"Nice, Multi-Purpose Mixing Bowl","Very nice unbreakable melamine mixing bowl! It is deep with high sides - less splatter when using a hand mixer. It also has a non-slip ring around the base which works very well. It doesn't slide around on the counter and is much quieter than ceramic mixing bowls. All of these bowls feature a huge, raised number on the side which refers to the capacity of the bowl. It's very modernistic and a little funky but if that's not objectionable to you, the stying is quite nice enough to serve from at the table."
3,Loved the size,"It is very difficult to push and turn corners. I would probably recommend the more expensive ones. But of you can't buy those, this is still a ver good product especially if you travel on even surfaces. It worked for two years and is now serving another family. Well made"
5,Love it!,"We love our new stroller! The only downside is space for my toddler when my infant is in her carseat. My toddler has to sit forward quite a bit. My infant will be big enough to go without the carseat soon, and then the space issue will be solved. It handles wonderfully and is easier than my travel system. Love it!"
4,Perfect - if only it fit into my trunk...,"I love this stroller, but I have a Dodge Caliber and the stroller won't fit in my trunk unless I fold down the back seat, which means it only fits if I don't have the kids in the car. Otherwise it would be 5 stars. When we go out with my mom (she has a minivan) my kids, who are 4 years and 2 months, absolutely love it. The front seat doesn't recline too far back, but my little guy likes to sit strait up so he doesn't miss anything. The shouder straps on the 5 point harness work wonderfully; they kept him upright at 5 weeks old! All in all a great purchase if you don't have an economy sized car."
4,Where have I been?,Must be one of the most well made double stroller. I had another one before and it was way to difficult to push (and Too heavy).This is perfect for an older child and a younger child. The only complaint I would have is the tray in the front is very very difficult to pull out! I had to have my husband take it off for my son to get out almost everytime!
5,Wished I bought it sooner!,"The Joovy is everything it says and more. My 4 year old loves the fact that she can hop on easily and my 2 year old loves to see his sister sitting behind him. I like that the canopy can come of for mall or inside walking. It makes for smaller folding. My husband even commented on the quality of the frame, it steers effortlessly!LOVE LOVE LOVE this stroller!There is an attachment for most infant carriers which I totally would have used if I would have purchased this stroller earlier.I asked several people I saw in the mall or on vacation if they were happy with their joovy and everyone had positive feedback. You won't be disappointed."
3,where is my stroller??,I ordered this stroller and never received it from cymax on Amazon. They took my money and never informed me until I inquired much later why I didn't have it!! I am very dissatisfied with Amazon and Cymax. I expect to receive the item I paid for at the price I was told it would cost which was $209 so I will not have to pay more for an item I should already have!!!!
5,Joovy Caboose,"My daughter-in-law and her almost 3-year-old loved the stroller. Toddler could sit facing Mama and the baby's car seat fit the front perfectly. It is light weight, easy to use --- a perfect first and last stroller for a growing family. The chartreuse color is cheerful and goes well with all the pink or purple the little ladies wear."
4,Great stroller,"We overall love the Caboose. The color is awesome (green) and overall design is good. It is a bit difficult to push up hills largely because my son is 40+ lbs and my daughter is 30. We mainly chose this option because of the fights over who got to ride. Now my son has his own big boy area and he very comfy there. I love the storage and the handle organizer is great. The sun shade provides nice coverage. Easy to fold and unfold. A big bulky, but is to be expected since it is a double. I do think it would benefit from sturdier supports, feels a little wobbly with the weight and the push up hill. Do take into consideration my son is a bit big to be riding in a stroller. Has worked well for our needs."
4,Good Buy for the price,"This stroller is great, The the compartment below the rear seat provides a good amount of space for various daipers and or snacks. Our little one's car seat fits in perfect and our second child loves the rear facing seat. It's a little bigger than we expected but it gives our kids room to grow."
5,Great stroller,"Love the stroller for a newborn and a 3 year old. I give it 5 stars because it rolls so easily and turns so easily too. I have tried a couple of other strollers and this one just seems to glide. It is pretty easy to put things in the basket and the canopy is very versatile so no one gets too much sun. I wish the seat would recline more for a newborn and the 3 year old could still sit, but that would make it a larger and heavier stroller, (not a good trade off). It is moderately heavy to lift into our SUV but it seems to be lighter than the other sit and stands. I wish it would close easier, (it has a latch that you have to squish it together and then fold the latch closed. Not so easy, but I will settle for those cons in exchange for the great ride and ease of use."
5,"Wow, we have 3 of these.....it's that good..","We own an orange ultralight for home, and a regular weight red one for one Grandma's house and a regular weight orange one for another Grandma's house. I love the narrow design and it's perfect for walking in malls, zoos, community pools, National Mall and museums, Disneyland, Six Flags, to parks, etc. It might be more cumbersome to take along on flights, hence we have 3, but it really is great for everything. I always get stopped by folks asking what kind of stroller it is. If you have two kids, this is one of the best double strollers out there."
4,double stroller,I used this stroller for my 18months and 35months toddlers. the older toddler sit or stand behind and the younger sit in front but the front seems to be narrow for my 18months toddler. The front table is very close to her chest and lack of room for movement.i wonder if is safe to remove the table.
5,Awesome stroller,"I absolutely love this stroller. I am not a tall or strong person but I can carry and maneuver it well. It rides smooth my kids enjoy riding in it. The stroller is about 1'9"" from left rear wheel to right rear wheel. When it is folded without the canopy lying flat it is about 3'6"" wide, and 1'2"" in height. When it is folded with the canopy on lying flat it is 3'10"" wide, and 1'3"" in height. It is pretty bulky, but compared to similar strollers that I have seen in stores this one is slightly smaller and lighter. My only gripe is with the rear seat. The seat slides back and forth for better access to the bottom basket. There is a strap to latch it in place but it still has movement(my son thinks it's fun though). Overall it's an awesome stroller and I enjoy using it. I have recommended it to family and friends and will definitely continue to do so."
3,I used this product mainly at night. My ...,I used this product mainly at night. My husband snores and it did help me to sleep somewhat better. I really don't think this product has any advantages over similar products on the market.
4,These ear plugs were very comfortable and reduced ...,These ear plugs were very comfortable and reduced noise significantly. I also like the carrying case provided to keep them clean.
1,Hurts to pull out!! Badly.,"I've never had a problem with wearing earplugs before using this product. It does a great job sealing off sound but when I pull them out of my ear, I have very bad pain inside my ear like the suction is pulling out my ear drum. No matter how slow or how careful I am pulling them out, i 'm still in pain. Like I said, use ear plugs to sleep all of the time, I suspect it is the extra cushion on the outside of the plug that is a culprit . Very bad product."
5,Ear Plugs That Work Great!,"The best thing about these is that when I compress them to put in my ears, they *stay* compressed for long enough to actually get them into my ear canals. Other ear plugs that I've tried expand too rapidly, and they become ""too wide"" too soon to get them inserted. I'm plagued by one ear having a very small opening and with other ear plugs I would struggle with many attempts (sometimes 10 or more) to get it into my ear. With the Leight Speepers, I usually get them in the first time."
5,Excellent for Toddlers!!!!!,"The first time I put this video in for my 2 1/2 year old triplet boys. I didn't hear a word out of them until the video was over, then they all chanted ""more Firehouse"" they watched this video 6 times and sat very nicely on the couch the entire time. Before their afternoon nap they all notice the fire alarm in the hall by their bedroom and said ""Get out fast!!!"" I was amazed that they actually understood the video. I would highly recommend this video for all toddlers. I will be purchasing more videos to this affect in the future."
3,Shaun and the other sheep get into adventures.,"""Shaun the Sheep: Sheep on the Loose"" is the third DVD release of episodes of ""Shaun the Sheep"". It has 6 episodes, where Shaun and the other sheep get into adventures. I did not enjoy this third DVD as much as the second, because the comedy has become too broad. As TV shows age, they tend to become too over the top, like Fonzie jumping the shark in ""Happy Days"". Cartoons need to follow some set of rules to be entertaining, like cartoonist Chuck Jones imposing the rule that the Road Runner could only run on roads. In this third DVD, I felt that Shaun and his fellow sheep could now do anything for the sake of comedy, and weren't following any rules. The DVD includes a short making of featurette. Reviewed 6/13/2009 after watching on DVD."
3,"Humorous shorts -- a bit short changed on the content, though","I love the Shaun the Sheep shorts and the shorts on this DVD are as good as the previous 2 DVDs. Note, however, that unlike the first two DVDs, this DVD only has 6 episodes and not 8. I hope that this isn't a new trend for these DVDs.The episodes on this DVD are: Sheep on the Loose, Saturday Night Shaun, Tidy Up, Shaun the Farmer, Camping Chaos, and If You Can't Stand the Heat. There are also a couple of features: The Mini Making of Shaun (a quickie look at how an episode is made) and Building a Pig (sort of a demonstration of how to build a model of one of the pigs using plasticine).I wish that the series had been released as a complete set in the US (as it was elsewhere)."
5,They're baaa-ack!,"Shaun the Sheep is perfect for children of any age. The stories are interesting, and there is always a good message.I've shown this DVD to kids from three to sixty-three, and all enjoyed it thoroughly.I highly recommend that you add the entire Shaun the Sheep collection to your private DVD library.In service,Rich[...]"
5,Got to love Shaun!,"Got this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves Shaun the Sheep, but I do too! He is always getting into something! Lots of giggles to be had!"
3,A Killing for the Hawks,"This center of this story, unlike most war storys, is not about war. "" A killing for the Hawks"" is almost a romance novel. The story is about Norman McConell, the son of a British couple, who joins the the RFC(Royal Flying Corps) in The First World War. He is assigned to a unit, that has the a British Flying Ace , John Seymour. Along with other characters, like Bush the downtrodden working class man, McConell serves many hours over the front. He also builds up respect for the aristocractic Ace. This respect changes after McConell, accedentally has an affair with Seymour's wife. She confesses that Seymour is a horrible sadist, explaining his extreme pleasure for killing men in areial combat. Seymour finds out about his wife's betrayal and, as he tells her, has a plan to get back at McConell. The books becomes increasingly intense, and it's ending, is totally unpredictable."
2,No dice,"Didn't do the trick for me. I was trying to go through a couple of plaster-and-lathe walls, which may be too much to ask, but even then it was less effective than the stock antenna.Plus, it comes in blisterpack packaging = impossible to return. :(YMMV."
3,Good but weak,"The antenna was easy to install and worked well, but it provided only a little more reach than the ominidirectional Linksys 7dBi that it replaced."
2,little improvement,I'm not seeing as much improvement in signal reception as I had hoped. Areas that were receiving acceptable signals before now show stronger reception. Areas that were marginal before show little improvement despite all efforts at antenna placement and aiming.
4,Antenna fits D-link and Linksys routers,Good antenna. Comes with an adaptor to fit linksys and d-link routers
2,Great film; poor DVD,"Unfortunately, the quality of print from which this DVD was made is atrocious. Scratches (including a persistent one running through the center of the picture during most of the film) are distracting enough. Worse are the gaps created by scotch tape splices, resulting in missing dialogue and irritating jumps. It is a shame that there isn't a good print of the film, which itself is a tour de force with extraordinary perfromances."
2,A disappointing DVD product of what was a fine film,"As a motion picture, this Stanley Kramer-produced treatment of Arthur Miller's play starring Fredric March is an excellent production, as are other treatments of the play. However, the rendering of this DVD product is inferior, containing numerous splices and film scrathes which badly interfer visually and aurally. The seller claims this: ""Brand new and factory sealed Authentic Region 1 DVD. Direct from the distributor."" The package claims a copyright for Nostalgia Family Video. Some time back, a quality vhs tape and perhaps a DVD were available. This distributor and consequently seller are not presenting a professional product Apparently, very unfortunately, a quality print is not available. This product is a last-resort purchase for anyone who desires this 1951 production."
5,Pacific Blue,This is a great soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
1,A good thing he kept on going............,"Steinbeck is one of my favourite storytellers, but this should never have seen the light of day, as his attempts to be quirky don't come off, and the whole thing is just, well, awful. He wrote some wonderful things, this just wasn't one of them."
4,Pretty good strings,"I bought most 3 of the gauges of this brand of string to see which one I liked. The 50-100 was too heavy and was more for jazz, while the 35-95 was way too light. The 45-105 is good and very versatile, but know I know I like the 40-100 (slightly light with some bottom). I also bought the bass big muff and the sound is great. However, know that I know the gauge, and like this brand, I will try other brands of the same gauge. If you want a versatile gauge, try the 45-105."
5,Never ending fun!,"I own this game, along with halo 2, preorder halo 3, gears of war, chrome hounds, and several other games. This game is awsome. I own the collectors edition. The only thing that bugs me is that there is only co-op and multiplayer online. I rather have a split screen. Besides that the story, graphics, and gameplay are all great. Get this game."
4,Nice little bag,"The best thing of this kit is the bag and the cables. Flashlight not bad, but I replaced it for a Dorcy LED.The rest of the kit have inexpensive parts, not really sure if I'd use them.I bought two, one for my car and the other for my wife. I feel protected with the quality of the cables and with the bag. You can even put more tools (and wipes) inside and they will fit perfectly!"
3,"Son likes them, but do they annoy me!","I do wonder if one day, I will forget the annoying theme song. Not likely in the future, since it is my son's favorite part of the video. In fact, he doesn't go too far beyond the theme song.I do like these. I could do without the mindless banter and silly conversations between the machines. But these aren't for me.My son, who just turned 3, picks these out every so often to watch. He loves the train one, because he loves trains.All in all, these are ok."
2,Dont ride on this train.,"I really try not to be negative in my reviews so I'll keep this simple:Pro's:There is a picture of a train on the BoxCon's:There are not a lot of trains on this DVD compared to others.There are too many Buses, Trollies, and Dump Trucks that really just act as filler.The camera work is poor; often shooting too close to their targets (trains) or only shooting the bottom half of trains.The female narrator is is is.... well lets just say Im sure she is trying her best.I Can not recommend this DVD.I would suggest these two titles for your train lovers:1) Real Trains for Kids: Mom and Pop video that is chuck full of trains and their daily doings. Really wholesome.2) Lots and Lots of Trains: Entertaining and instructional with plenty of songs and an abundance of trains."
3,More Mighty Machines!,"This is the least favorite of my son's collection of Mighty Machines videos. He loves trains, but for some reason, this video gets thrown aside. He'd much rather watch Winter Blast or Machines on the Job.Mighty Machines: Winter Blast!andMighty Machines: Machines on the Job"
5,Mighty Machines: Making Tracks,This is a wonderful video if your kids love trains and buses of anykind. It goes through all kinds of different trains and what they do and how they work and underground trains. It is very educational and my grandkids never get bored and they are 4 & 6. They learn so much and can almost tell me about the whole movie.
1,Not worth buying,"I have 11 aquariums and this is the worst light I have. This product is so cheaply made, it does not stay lit, it is flimzy. The bulb had to be replaced the first day.I would not recommend this to anyone,"
4,"Don't Miss It,","A Fantastic sizzler of a book, the kind of book Alastair Maclean, Hammond Innes, etcwould have been proud of. From the shadowy world of human trafficking, comes thisbeast of a story, that picks you up & hurls you against the nearest wall, it never letsup.Without doubt one of the best thrillers it's been my pleasure to read in Years !The Blood Price"
1,Don't bother!,"I have tried many pilates DVD's with and without props and this one is not worth paying or doing. The instruction is ok, quality of video is good BUT the workout itself is 40 minutes of nothing really... very disappointing!"
3,"Good product, but got a lemmon","The product in general: you're not going to get a stronger, more versatile, mic stand. The fact that you can adjust the feet and the angle of the stand makes it almost as good as a boom stand. When set straight up, it's super stable. The squeeze grip for adjusting height makes it a piece of cake to use, which is particularly important when you have non-musicians that have to periodically use the mic. I took one star off because it's a little on the pricey side.The specific one that I got: a total dud. It couldn't even hold up the weight of a mic without sinking back down. Amazon made good and took it back though, with free return shipping. Had they not been on backorder, I would have had them send a replacement. Got it from another retailer and it works exactly as advertised. Took a second star off for the defect."
2,Tribute to Lackey,"THe local high school had a ""tribute to Elvis"" which wasn't bad as school concerts go - but I would be unhappy had I bought the tape believing it was bonafide Presley.I felt the same about this book. Big type saying MERCEDES LACKEY and obvious fantasy - great, picked it up for airplane reading, and was annoyed to find Lackey had written only the verses it was based on. ANd I have never been an admirer of her verses.It was a bit like being a high school teacher and having to read the efforts of a whole class told to write an essay on one topic. I would want to get paid to do that!"
1,Not up to par!,"When I bought this book the synopsis sounded interesting but I would have bought it anyway since Mercedes Lackey's name was on the cover. What a disappointment. The story was good as far as it went, which was one chapter, but it just kept repeating and repeating and repeating ad nauseum. When I finished what I thought was the first chapter I was intrigued and curious to see how the story would be developed. It wasn't. After the third rewriting of the story I put the book where it belonged, in the garbage. This was an extremely disappointing story. I also expected to find more development of the significance of Lammas (August eve). I obviously do not recommend this book to anyone."
3,Good option for extended shoots.,"It's a good accessory for those who need to have two batteries online all the time. For those of us who aren't heavy with the shutter, just get a second batter and throw it in your bag. The grips on the K20D don't really require more gripping surface.I've been to sporting events where this is a really handy option, when you really need the extended shooting time, but this might be 3 times a year. Normally, it's no issue to just plug in a spare for the main.Don't know that I'll ever use the additional buttons on it either. Up to you for preference I guess. I find it useful for the additional memory storage as well as longer shoots when I need it. Otherwise, it's off the camera, in my bag. A K20D with the grip won't fit in the Pentax slingbag without fear of ripping the zipper.Overall, good quality, no issues figuring it out, and found some worth, but you may want to consider the spare and putting the $130 into a DA lense you might be fawning over."
4,good grip,"The battery holder/grip improves the camera handling when holding the camera for vertical shots. It holds an extra D-L150 battery which can power the camera when there is no battery in the camera body. The grip also has storage space for the remote controller and space to store a replacement SD card. Unlike the battery this is only a neat place to have a spare card--it does not record images when in the holder. The grip does not hold regular AAA batteries. This is a mistake in a review on a photo magazine web page, it is a shame but Pentax does not make that claim. As I said, grip improves the handling of the camera when held vertically. The improved balance more than compensates for the little extra weight. If you have a K20D or K10D I can recommend getting this grip while supplies last."
1,Useless for anything but an added hand grip.,I bought the grip for the (supposedly) doubled battery life for time lapse shots and such. This grip does not double your battery life. It does allow you to carry an extra battery as it does an extra memory card onboard the camera but your camera will still shut off when whichever battery you have currently selected dies. In order to use the second battery you must restart the camera and it will automatically select the fully charged battery (most of the time).The only advantage battery wise from this grip is that you don't have to take an extra few seconds to swap the battery out. If you are expecting doubled battery time it is not happening with this grip.The only true advantage this battery grip has is the added hand grip area itself and this is certainly a high price to pay for added grip alone.
5,"Pentax Quality: Form, Fit, & Function","This Battery Grip fits my K10d like a glove just as advertised and has the quality and functionality you expect from Pentax high end products. The ability to store the extra battery and the extra control buttons which allow you to operate the camera in the 90 degree (portrait) mode is nifty. With the extra battery on board it does add weight to an already hefty SLR package. With the K10d mounted with say an 18-250mm telephoto, you've got a handful. But if you're into Pentax DSLR and need a great grip, you've probably already thought about that. Fine product!"
2,Cheaply derivitive,"A supervisor at Boston's Logan airport is murdered and union ramp agents are suspected. This is the premise of Hard Landing, and a clever one it would be if it weren't taken from a real-life crime. Heitman acknowledges her ""inspiration"" once during the novel by (shamelessly) citing the real murder as part of her narrative. One wishes she at least would have chosen a venue other than Boston for her novel, but being that the author worked at Logan for years I guess the familiarity was too great and the imagination required to transport the scenario somewhere else too daunting. Having said that, it was an entertaining enough read, but being somehwat familiar with the real-life murder kind of ruined it for me. Kind of tramples on the grave at worst and lacks imagination at best."
3,Regional inaccuracies makes it iffy,"I was nearly suckered into taking a job as an airline baggage monkey (""ramp agent"") at Logan a couple years back, and this novel reinforced the wisdom of walking away from that with its descriptions of how difficult the job is in terms of abusive coworkers and responsibility for human lives and millions of dollars in property damage. However, some of the details about the Greater Boston area really threw it off for me and reinforced Heitman's carpetbagger status, like using ""Port Authority"" instead of ""Massport"" like everyone else I know. Also, her descriptions of Marblehead are completely off-base: it does not look like it was transplanted from Europe, the number of detectives in the Marblehead PD can be counted on one hand, and coffee shops are not called ""crumpet shops."""
4,"From sleepy town to Tech-boom, Grunge sound, ""Nirvana...""","This book really does a good job of introducing the un-initiated to Seattle's more recent history. Using real life events experienced by the author himself, you get a real sense of what Seattle was, grew into, and what lies ahead for the Emerald City. A bonus for those interested in the start up of Microsoft and the Grunge movement of alt music. A must read for Seattle-ites and those just interested in the history of this cool town."
5,Fred Moody brings out the tru story of Seattle,"I read this book from cover to cover with great interest.Being an English Major and a life-long journalist, Moody writes with great precision and passion.Moody is a Seattler in his heart and soul and he knows the ins and outs of the city and he brings out the best and the worst of the city he loves.The flow of his writing and the episodes in the city's history he writes on would make one love Seattle as much as he does."
2,Incompatible,I had no idea that Leapster was incompatible with Leap Frog 2 and Leap Frog explorer. Leap Frog should do away with such an old product and fitting it to the new hardware.
1,Can't get it to work!,"The game freezes up every time my daughter tries to play the game with Chip and doesn't save her profile when it is turned off. I bought a brand new set of batteries for the Leapster, hoping that was the problem, but there was no change. Not worth the money if you can't play all the games!"
1,Does not work!,"I just got this game for my daughter for Christmas and it doesn't work. We have been trying to figure it out for an hour, I wanted to throw it across the room. Waste of money!!!"
2,Not worth the effort,"Some of the games on the device did not work, or, I as an adult could not figure them out...not worth the effort. The leapster comes with it's own games that are enough entertainment for a 4-5 year old."
4,Great for the little Princess,"My 4-year-old loves this game. She prefers it over all the other Leapster games she has, which might have something to do w/ the Princesses! However, she (and I) like this game better than the other Leapster Princess game. Bottom line: if my daughter is happy, then so am I! Great buy."
4,good for young learners,"not great but good. think the age markings are a bit off,my kindergarder is almost past it but still enjoys it."
2,not very fun,"I bought the Disney Princess Worlds of Enchantment game for my 5-year-old daughter because she loves anything princess, but she was quickly bored of the games in this cartridge. After trying out the games, I have to agree that the games are pretty boring and slow-moving. She prefers the Get Puzzled game, which was surprising since the graphics aren't particularly pretty."
1,HOW CAN WE KNOW?,"For 149 bucks, the seller BETTER put some info up about this recording. No info, no cover pic, no song list, no recording date, no band member names. NOTHING. There are at LEAST 6 or 7 CD's in the Buddy Rich list that are EXACTLY the same but with different covers. Nice try. No thanks."
5,Superb summerizing of the first ten years of A.C.,"This is an excellent album, which contains many previously unreleased beautiful songs. The second CD is a concert recording from their sold out rare concert casette, published before the Overground Music. The songs, which were previously published in English (from Overground Music) are in Hungarian version on this album. Ketseg es remeny kozt, Tepd el a kepeket, Arnyekos dal, Impromptu No. 7, Jo ejt, Herkules dala,... are my all time favourites. I can recommend this album to everyone. If you like this, you may also buy Overground Music, Megalazottak es Megszomoritottak (Insulted and Injured) or De Profundis. Visit extra.hu/after-crying"
4,good product,Bought a few of these for my wife's baking endeavors. The quality is very good and the head comes off for cleaning. Excellent.
4,Bob comes through again!,"Bought this for my 3-yr. old grandson. He loves it and the bonus Scrambler was even a bigger hit! Now it's become his ""go to"" entertainment when weather's bad or he just needs to settle for awhile."
4,Bob The Builder:Truck Teamwork DVD,I ordered this dvd for my grandson who is three. He loves it and watches it over and over. He especially loves the talking tools.
4,"""The Last Unicorn"" songs were great","Great covers of ""The Last Unicorn."" The orchestrated version was particulary good."
3,Good product,I can find a better quality and at a better price. These are not the same as Ideal. And if it were not for the free shipping I would have not bought these.
4,the downward slide,"An excellent look at the effects of serious gambling addiction. Good plot- How a man with every reason in the world to not be involved in the shady world of gambling (fulfilling profession, good family, the intelligence and clarity to know exactly what's happening to him) lets it dominate him. Makes you wonder how many people across from you at the table in Vegas or the Indian reservation are also on the slippery slope. One complaint: Nobody doubles down with 18, expecting to get a 3 to beat the dealer's supposed 20, not even a reckless maniac. Observation: Basketball talent has improved considerably since the 70s! However the Manhattan court scenes with afros were great!"
4,Authentic Portrayal of addictive gambling,This film shows the mentality and thought process of someone who is a gambling addict. The lengths that James Caan goes to keep playing even though his ability to pick winners has eroded and the affect it has on those in his life is right on the mark. The movie accurately shows how the glamour of winning becomes secondary to the need just to have the risk and unflinchingly shows what can happen if you get caught in this complusive trap. It is a scenario I know about from first hand experience
3,"Caan,s Con!","A Very sardonic James Caan plays a self destructive addicted gambler to the hilt. Even during moments of supposed euphoria..Caan seems to know the ""drug"" will wear off son.Students and other people have no meaning..they are not even a diversion..because his one goal is ACTION..and without action he is nothing to himself as he is a lonely man on a very lonely journey..Paul Sorvin plays "" Hips"" ( aptly named) A very downbeat film with a terrifying finale..if one comprehends the reflection in the mirror."
4,good anthology,This is a very good anthology for anyone who wants to begin getting a handle on the literature on materialism. The selection of essays is very good and includes many historically important pieces.
4,"A good dialogue, but has a weak start","This book was on the whole a very well structured anthology showing how the debate amongst materialists has evolved on the nature of mind and the body. Hackett continues a fine tradition of providing first-rate philosophy at great prices.My chief gripe is that the dualistic selections at the beginning are Descartes and Spinoza--the latter in particular tends to be a favorite strawman for materialists and othere modern philosophers, and while a dualist myself I don't like Descartes' way of proving it. I understand that this book concentrates on materialism, but perhaps for another edition they could go for putting in a selection on dualism from Kant?That caveat aside, I still think this book a great introduction for a topic that will only grow more important as neuroscience progresses."
4,Good Entertaining Read,"This book was a quick and entertaining read. The author is indeed a good story-teller. He gives a lot of good information about what is available at courthouses, discusses legal descriptions, property boundaries, real estate agents, attorneys, deeds, water, utilities, surveying, house-moving, etc. But as for FINDING a piece of property or for finding one CHEAP, he really didn't offer much more than a few simple suggestions (and never even mentioned the internet!). There was no tax sale, no government auction, no re-po, no magic formula - just waiting for luck and a newspaper ad to produce a seller with the right property & price. But it was an interesting adventure."
4,Cheap land: A how-to book,"I didn't buy this book; I sat down in the library and read it cover to cover in about an hour and a half. It's a quick read, but there is more solid, practical advice on finding the right piece of land than any book I've ever seen. In addition to the how-to's of finding that land, there is advice on other factors to consider, such as water tables, utility service, and such. When it's time for me to get serious about buying some land, this will be my first purchase. Highly recommended"
5,Excellent Book! I give it 5 of 5 stars.,"A captivating story. I seldom ever finish a magazine article, let alone a book. I received Ralph's book in the mail and began reading it to myselft at around 5pm, took a break for dinner and then started over reading it to my wife this time. By 1am, we had read the entire book. As I had hoped, it has stimulated our interest in the subject. I just wish more people would use Ralph's ""story telling"" or ""narrative"" format when writing books about their experiences in buying land and homes - it is so entertaining to learn through the experience of others."
4,Solid advice,"Ralph Turner uses his own personal story of finding the perfect piece of rural property near his home in Iowa to teach and educate the reader on buying country land.Written with warmth and humor, the book is an easy, enjoyable, and informative read. And while some of the information may be a bit outdated, Mr. Turner's yarn is still a valuable resource to any investor's library."
3,Poor fitment,I have used K&N products on almost every vehicle I've owned and this is the first time I've even been a little disappointed. The fitment was terrible. The main tube rubbed against the radiator and the brace that was supplied was pointless because it didn't really hold the inlet tube at all.
5,A compassionate story of living and dying,"My emotions experienced a roller coaster ride of laughter, tears, sadness and joy. I admire Elizabeth's honesty in sharing her husband's battle with cancer and her personal struggle to be supportive and to endure. This skillfully crafted book should be read by anyone who has lost a loved one to cancer; it provides all readers with insight and coping skills. I found Wednesday's at the Fluff 'n' Fold to be a beautiful celebration of life!"
4,Wednesdays at the Fluff 'n' Fold,"I recommend this book for anyone who finds themselves in the position of being a caregiver. It is written in a manner that is to the point and easy to understand. A must for anyone who finds themselves under the stress of caregiving. Elizabeth tells her story with honesty and moments of humor. Any caregiver who reads this will find that he/she is not alone in the multitude of feelings that are a part of loving and caring for someone who is in need of so much. Family members and friends of caregivers will also find this book helpful to give them some insight into what a caregiver might be experiencing. As a parish nurse, I highly recommend this book for anyone who is caregiving or knows someone who is a caregiver."
1,The Emperor's New Clothes,"I have been teaching calculus at a university for over 20 years. I was on the adoption committee to select calculus texts. I had heard that the Stewart text was a national best seller, so I volunteered to review it. I was startled. I can see now reason why this text is widely used. It is even more difficult to believe that its author has had any classroom experience with honest-to-goodness calculus students. The writing is rambling and obtuse. The design is not helpful and blends prose with examples. The art is irregular, some art is small and some is huge, some topics that cry for graphs have none and some that don't need graphs have several. I have used several other texts and it appears that the author used a cut and paste technique to create this text, taking liberally from other best sellers. After a careful review of this ""popular"" text, I felt obligated to write this review. Someone needs to point out that the ""emperor is not wearing any clothes!"""
1,The author and publisher is clear indication of low quality.,Any Calculus Textbook from James Stewart is low quality. This book will teach you nothing. It will just confuse you more.
1,The Holes are Too Big,"I bought this for use with my students. There are 20 puzzles and I didn't read all of them. I scanned 10 and imagined attempting these with my 8th graders. The stories or riddles are so broad that I'm not sure the kids would be able to narrow their ideas to even get close to the answer. Actually, adults would have the same difficulty b/c the answers are pretty odd in many cases. (Not the kind of odd that makes you think, ""Oh, how clever."")"
5,An enchanting book about a cat and a little girl.,"This great book is about a girl and a cat who are friends. The pictures are beautiful and all ages will enjoy it. In the story, when the ""Little People"" capture the girl, it's up to Catkin to get her back. Read This Book!!!"
5,"Wonderful story, beautiful book","After stumbling accross this book at the library and reading it to my three youngest children I just have to buy it for our home library. The story is enthralling: sad, sweet, mysterious - a real page turner that brings tears to your eyes. As a mother the thought of losing your baby is unbearable and I had to see how it would turn out. The artwork is just stunning and worth the price alone without the story. Not since Black Ships Before Troy have I seen such artwork. This is a must-have book for anyone who loves fairy tales, great stories and beautiful art. I only wish it were available in hardback as this is one I'd be willing to pay the extra money for more durability."
5,"Absolutely exquisite illustrations, lovely fairy tale","I just recently acquired this early book from PJ Lynch's illustrated works. The changeling story by Antonia Barber is lovely and lyrical and kindhearted, and the accompanying paintings by Mr. Lynch are full of life, full of light and shadow, exquisitely done. Highly recommended."
4,The book Rocked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This boook was so cool. its about a cat who was so tiny it could fit in the palm of your hand! Its name was Catkin cause it was so small It was given to this family because they had a baby. Cat kin was the graden of this baby. And one day the baby was taken by the little green people that talk in rhymes and rittles. Can Catkin Save the baby in time and under stand the green people? read and find out
2,"""Read The Book Instead"" comments are 100% correct.","This movie was all over the map... with the attempted style of a desperate rambling Magnolia plot with an obvious (and valid) political agenda but with nothing really meaningful to tie everything and everybody together. It had a dozen or two political points to make but no cimematic point to speak of. Read the book... get all the same information... and skip the movie. It felt like it was way too long. The little promo cartoon in the DVD extra's called ""Backwards Cow"" or ""Backwards Burger"" was absolutely just as effective as the entire movie and pulled it off in less then five minutes. I thought the cast and acting performances were plenty solid... just wasted in this mess of a movie."
3,A Bit Preachy,"The fast food industry is an easy target, and this drama pulls no punches in stereotyping it as greedy and heartless. This is a drama, not a documentary, though. The pace is enough to keep the viewer watching, despite the knee-jerk underlying messages that fast food is a horror. The slaughter scenes are graphic. Worth watching as entertainment."
1,Watch with caution,This movie was not what I expected at all. I was expecting a movie that took us behind the scenes of fast food restaurants but instead found a broad range of issues. Also the graphic nature of the film was very surprising to me. I don't feel like I learned anything I didn't already know about from media coverages of fast food restaurat issues. I was shocked by the immigration portion of this film. I wish I had never watched the movie.
5,"Careful, you may not eat meat again!","I read the book a couple of years ago and was disturbed...but the movie really brought the message home for me. I actually enjoyed the movie very much and would highly recommend it. I guess that my expectations were pretty low coming in, but the A-List actors that took part in the project did wonders for what could have been an awful movie.A Caveat...if you're on the fence, you may find yourself headed down the road to veganism. After watching it, I thought that I may not be able to eat meat again...but then I got home and made myself some pepper steak all was well."
1,I thought it might have something to do with health,"My wife and I are interested in health and thought this movie might be somewhat like ""Supersize Me"", in that it might have something to do with health.It doesn't. It seemed to be saying that the problem with our country is greed, therefore don't be sucked into the system. Don't patronize chain restaurants or hotels or any big business, don't work for them.If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't have watched this movie."
2,So What?,"The problem with Fast Food Nation is that it is a film that really doesn't know what it wants to be. There are three story lines, more or less related to the fast food industry: illegals working in a meat packing plant, young men and women working in one of the franchises, and the corporate executive trying to look into the whole fast food process, from processing to selling. Unfortunately, only the first plot line comes even close to being developed. About two-thirds of the way through Greg Kinnear (the executive) just disappears from the film! Unlike the book, there is certainly no sense of expose in the film - it's not like people don't already know about corporate greed, that fast food isn't good for you, that in real life the bad guys win most of the time. Sadly, there is a lot of talent involved in this film, but the feeling at the end of the movie is a big ""so what?"""
5,Mind blowing,The film is a mind blowing and informative work on fast food. It makes people aware of what they eat and that' s the most important thing. At some scenes I couldnt watch.
1,...In The Meat,That's pretty much it for that stink bomb of a movie.What's even worst the cast the storyline & avril lavigne in this film.Does anyone ever say no in hollywood ?Skip this one and go see super size me.
2,Trys to Get a Point Across,"Fast Food Nation is okay. Not great but okay. It shows the big picture of feed lots, illegal emigration, and corporate fast food and how they are intertwine with one another. It is a crime the way food is grown, harvested, and processed in the United States. Maybe someday more people will become aware of how bad things are in the food that is sold. THere are sexual scenes in this movie which are not needed. Guess Hollywood is just as bad as corporate food processors.Better documentaries would be Fresh, King Corn, and Food Inc."
2,Had to force myself to finish it,"The acting is mediocre, the story drags and is all over the place. I really had no idea what it was supposed to be about, and it wasn't until the movie was over that I had to piece everything together to understand (hopefully) what the filmmakers intended. What a waste of time. I see the book has better reviews. I gave 2 stars versus 1 for the attempt to get an interesting message across."
3,Doesn't convey the facts.,"This film was okay. While portraying the hideousness of the disturbing meat industry, it revolved more around the hardships of the employees and people involved. It failed miserably to convey the facts that the book details. They're quite bellowing too, so not to include them is unforgivable. It didn't seem like anyone even read the book. While the film disappointed me immensely, at least it may provoke uninformed people to become informed. Though I'd recommend just not to be lazy and read the book first. You'll be floored."
1,Too many adult themes,I was expecting a story version of the book that would entertain as well as educate and found a story version with too many adult extras. There was no need for porn sounds in the beginning or the added nudity later as it did not enhance the story. This was a very disappointing movie.
1,should hae been a documentary DONT BUY THIS DVD!!!!,"very poor story they should have stuck to the book ..funny but but very poor movie should have been a documentary DONT BUY THIS DVD buy the book fastfood nation and the dvd ""food Inc"" now thats good stuff !!!!!!!!!!!! infact im going to return this dvd its so bad"
2,"good message, good cast, horrible movie","I liked the message alot and it definitely made me not want to eat fast food EVER again. i liked the cast alot too but the movie it self, i just didnt like. there was something about it but i dont know what. definetly worth seeing once but not good enough to own or yet watch it more then once. you're better off reading the book.."
2,"Read the Book and Watch ""Super Size Me""","If you know the book well, you will be disappointed by this film. You'll start to feel hopeful when you notice a snippet from the book emerge and then you'll be disappointed to see it quickly dropped in favor of a story about the lives of illegal immigrants. There is a lot of sex in the movie that isn't in the book at all and almost everything positive from the book has been removed. The issues in the book need to be considered by everyone in America, but this movie doesn't provide them in great enough depth.If you want to see a film about this topic, ""Super Size Me"" is much more entertaining."
1,I'd rather watch 10 hours of that clown Alton Brown from the Food Network,"This movie blew. If your like me and read and enjoyed the book, this movie is a waste of time. Its all fiction, and stupid at best. Instead of watching this riff raff, watch Super Size Me, or read a book called Slaughterhouse: The Shocking Story of Greed, Neglect, And Inhumane Treatment Inside the U.S. Meat Industry, by Gail A. Eisnitz. If that book dont make you want to yak up last nights meatloaf, then your one of the morons that gave this idiotic garbage more than 1 star."
2,Huge Disappointment if You Have Read the Book!,"I had no idea that this movie was NOT a documentary, and I was stunned that the author of the book allowed this film to even be called by the same title! While the film itself does have a very interesting story, and the acting is good, it is so shallow in comparison to the book. I realize that the book was a thoroughly-research academic work, and that one can not expect a movie to recreate all the information in the book. But this movie is a gross simplification of the really important facts. If you have NOT read the book, you will probably enjoy the film. But after you watch the film, be sure to read the book -- it is VERY enlightening!"
2,Dissapoiting,"The movie is about the fast food industry, the lack of sanitary conditions and the lack of humane conditions. Throw in some race issues, gender issues and men being chauvinistic pigs PLUS some lack of self-respect and this is the movie. I was dissapointed, this movie lacks a cohesive plot and all plots are left somewhat unresolved. They could have had a great movie had they carried out the plot better. Instead, the film debased each and every one of its characters to the vilest of actions and morality. The film merely points out to the issues of race, animal rights, sex, etc...but does not really explain their nature, or a solution. The characters are left to exist within their own world, existing selfishly through the own suffering and preserving it at the same way as they fall in the viscious cirle that started at the beginning of the movie."
4,More relevant than ever!,"Fast Food Nation sheds light (as it should do) on several important matters, including: how powerful the Fast Food giants and their associate companies have become, the poor quality of meat and health standards, and how immigrants are being treated and exploited by Americans and other immigrants alike.The film brings to the screen the parallel stories of various people associated with a meat packing plant in Colorado that supplies the patties for a (fictional) fast food chain called Mickey's.Greg Kinnear, Bruce Willis, Kris Kristofferson, Ethan Hawke, Avril Lavigne, Luis Guzman, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.The setting, the plot, and the dialogues are all good and even though it's quite graphic at times it does get the message across loud and clear.In short, Fast Food Nation is a movie definitely worth watching, as it is surely an eye opener. 3.5 Stars"
5,"Organics, or bust!","I've been on the ""Organic Trail"" since reading this book, and have never felt better. The movie could have been a very effective documentory, and may still be covered that way if it can avoid the lobbying force that would stop it.This show is a must see for everyone, whether they eat fast food or not. The horrors covered in here are very real (I've worked in fast food and have known meatpackers) and very avoidable. The actors did a fine job with their roles, and were believable and enjoyable enough without competing for academy awards.If you're going to insist on opposing the message this show promotes, you may do well to ask yourself why our beef, and now even our grains, are being banned around the world."
2,ho hum,"There is really no story to this film. It just keeps jumping around. There are a couple of sex scenes but nothing really exciting. I suppose the point of the film is that we all quit eating at McDonalds, Arby's, etc. During the last 10 minutes of the film there is shots of the killing of the cattle and it is GROSS."
4,review,"Careful about eating burgers, shows the way meat is processed and and abusive treatment of immigrant labor in the plant."
3,wrong zone,Please explain me why you have send me a zone 1 dvd were i am in a zone 2 area ???????Is there a way to play it ...there seeem to be a coode to change my dvd player ?Or can you send me a zone 2 ?Thanks and regardsharrie
5,The Kill Floor,"SPOILERS AHEAD!!!This is more of a commentary than a review but take what you will from it.I read a review that said they wished for closure on the Greg Kinnear story arc... The closure was, that there was NO closure to his thread... or any of the other threads.I think many viewers wanted something (ironically) neatly packaged for easy consumption... maybe spoonfed?The whole movie was basically a ""six degrees of separation"" of the fast food industry.Yes, for the most part illegal aliens do work in meat processing plants... yes the women may or may not have to do things to get ahead (but that happens EVERYWHERE).Impressionable youths go off and become crusaders, and people that know what really goes on in the industry stay in there cushy jobs collecting a fat check, and turn the other cheek.That's it for now. I'll add more later."
1,Always preview movies!,I have read the book and referred to it several times since it came out. I thought it would be an excellant movie to show my foods students. Watching the movie I didn't remember the f--- word being used at all and certainly no sex. I even went back to the book to double check! It was truly amazing that anyone would take a serious book and make it so totally inappropriate for viewing in a classroom. Guess that is what sells?
1,Very disappointed!,I was hoping to use this to show in my high school health class - no such luck. There was unecessary sex that when previewing I couldn't figure out why it was even there! I didn't even finish watching it!
4,Good!,I agree with the other reviewers. This Suave Body Wash Soap is good and I have used it in the shower and I have used it for hand washing and as a shaving gel and I like the nice pleasant scent and the fact that it didn't leave my skin feeling dried out but though I like this Suave Body Wash Soap I prefer their Cucumber Melon scented Body Wash soap which is actually the same light green color as this Aloe Vera and Vitamin E version but this was good too. If you are using this for hand soap make sure you only use a small amount or you will end up with a sink full of soap suds. Just a small amount on your fingertip is enough.
5,"Refreshing scent, rinses clean","I agree with the previous reviewer in that this is a great product for its diversity of uses. It's the only body wash our house uses. I've found lately that it has been harder and harder to find but once I found it here I might swich completely. The price is great for the wonderful product you get. Mildly scented, this body wash isn't sticky, lathers very well, and rinses clean. I love it!"
3,Pretty shoe but very narrow,"I've had several other Indigo shoes and loved them. I have a pair of kitten heals in a 8 1/2 but in flats I always wear a US size 9 and have never needed to 'break them in'. Thats why I was SO disappointed when I got these home (size 9) and found that though the length was fine, they were very narrow. I couldn't even wear them for 5 minutes around the appartment they pinched so much. On looks alone I would have given '5 stars' but had to rate '3 stars' because the fit is inconsistant with other Indigos. Returned them. 'Summer shoe search' continues!"
2,Bad decision,"I bought these at the actual Clarks Store a while back and i haven't worn them since. In the store they seemed to fit fine walking around, but when i tried to wear them a few days later they gave me blisters on the top sides of my feet and at the heel. PAIN!i thought they look really cute and i was so mad because they weren't that cheap. What a waste"
5,A great assortment,"A nice variety of hooks. The metal is not so thin that the hooks wobble around in the peg holes. I use them in my booth at the Mega Mall in Lansing, it's nice when I have something I need to display and have a the perfect hook available."
4,great assortment,"If you're looking for an assortment of parts and pieces for your pegboard (a beginner/filler kit, so to speak), then this is definitely for you! However, the pieces are not the super sturdy kind and might need reinforcers if you are hanging something heavy. A great buy for the price though."
2,Thye are 1/8 not 1/4,"They are 1/8th inch peg board holders not 1/4. There were some plastic ""anchors"" as others have described but no directions on how to use them. It's probably best to buy a 1/8 inch pegboard or find some real 1/4 inch hangers. I am sending mine back."
2,Not a good choice,The hooks are not strong enough and fit very poorly on the metal pegboard. Home Depot has better ones with similar price tag.
3,Hooks I don't need,There were new many of the strait hooks and too few of some of the hooks that hold screwdrivers and pliers.
4,light weight,This is a good for the money selection of hooks but the wire is light gauge and the button that locks in some of the hooks is too large and it is difficult to make them fit into the board.
4,Best for the money,"This is the best assortment for the money. Some of these are flimsy, while other pieces are stronger. These will work great for home applications, I wouldn't hang my professional equipment on these though. Overall, you can't beat the price."
2,Very flimsy hooks,"You get what you pay for. I couldn't use these at all. I purchased metal pegboard, and these hooks looked like they were mad from wire cloths hangers. I wouldn't wast my money on these unless you you are hanging very light items."
3,You get what you pay for,"I purchased these for garage organization. While you do get a variety of different hooks, they are not strong enough to hold anything with any weight to it. They just bend, even if you use 2 together. Its a good idea, they just needed to be stronger for the garage use I wanted to use them for."
2,not so stable,"Why is it so hard finding some good quality pegboard hooks?I bought these for my bicycling gear - helmets, gloves and some tools. nothing major.Every 2-3 times i grab a something they come flying off the pegboard.This is even after securing them with the cheesy black plastic lock-downs."
4,Good product,Purchased this hook assortment to supplement some that I already had up on my peg board. Quality product and I really like the hold downs that keep the hooks attached to the board. Had they been just a little heavier guage steel I would have rated 5 stars.
4,no title,"This is a tough book to rate, and I am giving it a four mainly for the terrific references to other books and web sites. Much of it is just plain common sense, as in ""well, duh!"", but sometimes it helps to see it in black and white. I particularly loved (thrown in for no apparent reason that I can discern) the exact instructions for driving from the easternmost point in the U.S., to the westernmost point, by the quickest route. Ditto the quickest way up Mount Everest. Some things are going to be impossible for the ordinary mortal - to wit, the quickest way to get rich is to marry money, or, to get invited to The White House, donate lots of cash. There are fun things, like how to solve a mystery, and how to perfect your golf swing, but all are only one or two pages of very spaced type. What the book is very strong in though, is the resources for further study. Includes interior decorating, feng shui, and the Library of Congress question site."
2,Must agree with other reviewers,"I am all for declaring your own tempo in music making, however I feel it is done here just to be different...not just to be musical.I don't feel the essensce of the music is captured in these recordings - however not a total dissapointment."
3,Why not say it? Jochum is ho-hum,"Anytime one gives Eugen Jochum a bad review, his (small) band of devotees lashes out, but it must be said that even for Jochum these are dull readings. The Schubert Fifth is in mono--not very good mono--and clumps along as if at a first rehearsal. It is without infectious joy or energy. You can find better performances by going to Tower Records and throwing a pebble at the Schubert section.The Schubert Ninth is in good stereo and is decently palyed. I was almost wonder-struck at how slack and limp Jochum manages to be in the first movement. He could have left the hall and put his hat in a chair; the reading would have been more vigorous that way. the remaining movements aren't slow--at 50 Min. Jochum's timing is average--and there are moments of energy later on. However, nothing shows panache or vibrancy, so the only value I can see in this CD is for Jochum's fans, who no doubt will hate this review."
2,Eh,"Much more boring than I thought it would be, given the success of the book(s). It's interesting insight into how statistics can be viewed differently, depending on ones understanding of the underlying data that makes up the statistics....DUH."
3,A bit over-hyped,"From the build up I expected more.Some interesting facts though too much is fluff.Not a bad watch, could have delivered more substance."
5,I didn't read the book,I didn't read the book so I had no expectations.It gave me a very different way to see several aspects of how the world works.I thought the video was great.
1,"The books are good, I had to turn off the movie. Also, not appropriate for younger viewers!","I had read the books and found them funny and thought-provoking. However, I turned off the movie about 20 minutes in when, in the midst of discussing the effects of children's names, the director decided to exploit the use of strippers. The names were barely blocking the women's breasts as they danced in their skimpy underwear. I found this offensive and unnecessary."
2,Not as ground breaking as it makes itself out to be.,This movie goes from one random thing to another giving the viewer mildly interesting incite.
3,"like a long ""this american life""",If you like the story telling style of 'this american life' or morgan spurlocks stuff then you will enjoy it.
2,ad nauseum,"One fellow is an economist and another fellow is a journalist. They act as if they are the modernistic Einstein and Gershwin of economics and journalism. They fool-heartedly dumb-down the documentary to a third grade level to serve the unread masses. I could not believe how much air time they devoted to a child's first name...pointless. Although, I really enjoyed the sumo wrestling gambling segment...worth the price of admission:)"
3,Dumbed down version of the book Freakonomics,"I've read the book ""Freakonomics"". I found the book interesting and thought provoking. When I saw that the movie based on the book was on Prime, I decided to watch it so as to make a comparison. Seemingly, all books turned to movies are necessarily dumbed down. A director has one point of view- his own, that he must relate in the allotted and limited time frame. The book was controversial and so is the movie. My advice as a reviewer, watch the movie if you haven't read the book. If you find that the film moves you-- makes you feel angry or you agree with it, do read the book! The book is much more interesting. Plus, it is annotated, so that the reader can follow up on the sources cited.The movie based on the book is at best a Cliff Notes version of the book."
2,Nothing new here!,This is one of those movies that you forget as soon as you finish watching it. Nothing groundbreaking or extraordinary going on here.
2,Extremely Misleading Cover,When you see the cover you think ohh wow something about genetic engineering but no it has nothing to do with any of that just a bunch of boring crap that is totally useless. Why don't they just show a guy being bored on the cover because thats what its really about
3,Lots of pieces,I did not find this easy to assemble. I also did not find it easy to secure. I ended up tieing it in place.
4,Listen to this !,"Great stuff ! Melodic, sensible and to every moment the right mood. Jeff Rona did a fantastic job with this record. Check it out !"
3,Different from The Yearning,"I didn't like this album as much as The Yearning by Michael Hoppe. The music isn't as flowing and slow. Shouldn't compare, I know, but I loved The Yearning"
3,"In my opinion not as well recorded as Album One, THE YEARNING","THE YEARNING, the first album, is one of the most beautiful albums I have ever heard.This one is similar, but didn't seem to be recorded as well. It seemed artificially too echoey. But again that is just my opinion."
5,Britney Spears - Lucky Pt. 2 (Enhanced),"First of all I would like to say that this cd is AMAZING!!Track <1> Luck [Album Version]3:26Track <2> Oops! I Did It Again [Rodney Jerkins Remix]3:09Track <3> Oops! I Did It Again [Ospina's Crossover Mix] 3:16Track <4> Lucky [Jason Nevins Mixshow Edit] 5:53Track <5> Lucky [Riprock and Alex G Radio Edit]4:01<Enhanced Video> Oops! I Did It Again 3:31CD comes in a cardboard cover. The greatest track on this CD is Track 4 it kind of reminds me of an Alice Deejay song. It is upbeat and not too fast but it is a Dance/Techno Mix w/ a cool break in the middle that sounds kind of Hip-Hoppy but it is so cool. Track 4 is a typical Dance Mix but dont get me wrong its groovy. The other tracks are ok the remixes of ""Oops!"" are Hip-Hop remixes they sound good but I dont think they work well with me but they are cool. If you have the chance to buy this rare and hard to find out of print cd do so no matter what the cost I promise you wont regret it."
5,"Add this one to your ""Lucky"" Collection",This is a CD. It contains 3 tracks and they are as follows:1. Lucky2. Lucky (Instrumental)3. Suggested Call Out Research HookThis is the Japanese single of the song titled Lucky. It comes in a standard jewel case -- not slimline (all Japanese versions come in standard jewel case.)So add this CD to your collection along side the other 4 track single of Lucky! The 4 track one is slimline and it's called Lucky #1 (Ltd) [IMPORT]Another must have for any Britney Fan!!!
2,"Good 2 have, but original tracks are better","The remixes are not horrible, but they get annoying after a while, and the original cutz of the songs are better. I think any Britney fan should have this, but that's as far as it goes."
3,Nainme Spears review.,"My seventh single on the kingdom hearts tour, taken from the 2cond album. Performed in Neverland, this was atribute to the lonley hearted Kairi.Different for me, it was upsseting to record and perform so I am only giving it a maximum total of three stars in total altogether..."
1,This CD does not worth a thing!,"Britney Spears is actually a very good singer without singing dumb remixes. I will tell you why this single is not worth a thing. First, if you buy the new album by Britney which is called ""Oops!...I did it again"", it includes the first track of this single. And secondly, those remixes are almost the worst songs I have ever heard. Finally, they said this single has a enchanced video, huh? Well, I will tell you what, buy the new video by Britney it is called "" Britney in Hawaii, Live and More!"", and it includes the video, so don't buy single and purchase ""Oops!...I did it again"", her new album and her newest video by Britney named ""Britney in Hawaii, Live and More!""!"
5,Love it!,"I first saw instead in CVS and began to seriously think about trying them. I read some reviews and went back to CVS to purchase them. I found instead very easy to insert and it hasn't leaked not one time since I've been using them. I will never use Tampons or Pads again. I do use a pantiliner though, just in case. I've been telling every woman who will listen about this product."
2,not what I expected,"I was so excited when I found these in CVS, I thought hey I can finally give up tampons and pads.. How wrong I was? I'm a heavy flow for at least 3 days and this was so inconvient, I had to change these at least every 3 hours like a tampon and so for me these didn't work. The only good thing I liked was that I could use them on my last 2 days or so, so that was kinda good.. I in my opinion they're okay but I'm thinking of trying the divacup instead.."
3,Diva,"I have tried these but I found the Diva Cup to be an even better product. It was sturdier and never needed replacing; I love it and would never go back to traditional products.I was disapointed to find Amazon doesnt sell them so I bought one off the web site, (...)"
4,Softcups,"I really like instead softcups as an alternative to tampons or pads. They work well, though they do take a little practice. And you can have sex with them in. However, I find that any time I do a ""bearing down"" motion like using the bathroom or sneezing or during a romantic interlude, the cup tends to want to shift out of place. I usually use a Diva Cup, but these work in a pinch and I would much, much rather use them than tampons.A note on the shipping: These took absolutely forever to get to me. I ordered them July 4th and they arrived August 22. They were shipped to an APO, but this is ridiculous! I'm pretty sure that the problem is ordering through the marketplace because I usually get my Amazon products much more quickly than that."
2,Serious Leaking Problems,"I was really looking forward to this product after reading all the rave reviews about how life transforming it is especially for those with heavy periods. Everyone was saying how it doesn't leak and you can leave it in for hours. Well I'm here to tell you that wasn't my experience. It started leaking after about 2-3 hours. And it is an absolute mess to remove. They are probably better than tampons but quite frankly that's not saying much. It is very easy to insert and fit in place, but it's definitely not as reliable as I would have hoped."
3,I don't think that the Instead softcup is ...,"I don't think that the Instead softcup is a product everyone will embrace with enthusiasm. Although I liked the idea of not having the embarrassing pre-sex tampon pull-out, I wasn't too thrilled with the discomfort I felt wearing it. The manufacturer says that it takes about three months to get used to it. I don't believe I'll be using the rest of it though. I'll be sticking to my old faithful brand and leaving this new miracle for others."
3,Use a reusable cup,"I originally tried these due to a combination of cost worries and environmental concerns about tampons. Pads are too much like wearing a diaper for me to use them at all. However, even when I positioned them correctly, they actually made my cramps much worse than wearing tampons. Also the leakage is a huge issue (and even sneezing can cause it) especially when wearing scrubs at a medical job. I could tolerate them, but found that after about 8 hours, even with emptying them, they were downright painful.The reusable cup is much more comfortable, no leaks and easier to position. If you are lukewarm on the Instead cups, try one of the reusables."
5,This product took a bit of practice but ...,"This product took a bit of practice but once I learned to use it, it worked wonderfully! They don't leak and you can wear them much longer than tampons. I think these would also save you money because you don't need to use as many as you do with tampons. I'd highly recommend this product to my friends."
1,"INSTEAD, try another product!","Instead cups were terrible for me! Aside from being difficult to insert into the proper position, and messy to remove and dispose of, the stupid things leaked at completely random times. It might be okay for an hour, and then would shift and spill, terrible leakage. Sometimes it would be okay for 3-4 hours and then leak all over making a horrible mess. Truly not worth the cost, not worth any cost! I would not use this product again if I was paid to, honestly. I have since purchased a Diva Cup and couldn't be more thrilled. If you are looking for a menstrual cup that preforms, doesn't leak and lowers the risk of TSS you must check out Diva. But please leave Instead on the shelf!"
5,Great for conception,"My husband and I have been trying for #2 and we were told to try the instead cup after being intimate. It kept everything from ""falling out"", I agree this is also because we were tracking my cycles so we knew when the best time was. But we are PREGNANT! I also use these for my time of the month as well and love them!"
3,great seller,I bought these hoping I could use them after AI. These are pretty big and I can't seem to get them inserted right. I have read they work great for those trying to conceive. I have a friend who became pregnant after using them.
3,This is the first time I ever used ...,"This is the first time I ever used this product and I'm not quite used to it. Personally, I don't really like it. It's just too awkward for me. I'd recommend it to everyone who's searching for something new."
1,I'm sorry but this is GROSS!,"I was so hopeful about these. I wanted an alternative to tampons that was healthy and environmentally-friendly (and cheaper!) So I was excited to try them. But it wasn't at all what I was expecting. I don't want to get into vivid details. But basically, I was not warned that this would be such a MESSY ordeal. Not to mention it's not at all convenient. I do not want to leave it in for too long, because if I do, I know it's not absorbing any fluid, so I worry about leakage, or the horrible mess that it will make all over my hands when I try to take it out. GROSS! Also, the thing itself is absolutely huge. I imagine most people would look at it and be terrified to try to put it in their bodies. I believe there was a reason tampons became so much more popular than these methods. Sorry, but I've got to switch back."
5,Buy two!,For serious fans of dance music this is as good as it gets. There were certainly no limits to the talent of the gentleman on keyboards and I like the lovely lady as well. Don't miss out!
4,a trip down memory lane!,"Just got the 2U cd from ebay, and it brings back a lot of memorys from when i was a 13 year old kid(1993) and thes song wher played a lot on school party's and mtv,back then i had a tape that i've lost several yeras ago,but when i poped the disc into my player al those fun memorys came back,and it amazes me still how these songs sound like they where made yesterday!Defenitly recomended to go crazy on but playing them in your car may cause some road rage as the beats pump through your ears!"
4,Weird Stuff,"Absolutely great music from yesteryear... or is it??I was very surprised to hear music from my own country STILL being played at the Superball finals in the US... it sure does sound awesome in a stadium!!My friends over there didn't believe it was from Holland and that it was 7 years old... until I showed them the album. It is one of the very few that goes with me all the time, wherever I go."
1,Don't waste your time,"This is an awful product! The box had version 1.02 that would capture video but it would not import MPEG-2 - it was supposed to. I tried to download the latest version 1.05 but I was not registered - AND I could not register because their site was broken. After sending a few emails and getting German-English replies, I finally got the latest patch about 4 days later. Now it imports MPEG-2 OK but it keeps crashing and exiting after about 10 seconds before I can get a chance to edit the import or figure out how the software is supposed to work. ..."
2,"Been there, seen that.....","Bought this just because my entire Eddie collection is still being shipped over to our new home and it was about the only one I hadn't already got.Was somewhat disappointed to find that it is basically just another performance from the Sexie tour. One or two different bits as you always find watching Eddie on different nights but not really enough to justify this being released.If you own Sexie on DVD, don't buy this. If you don't own Sexie, buy it as it's a better performance."
5,A laugh Riot,"This DVD is another winner from the comic genius of Eddie Izzard. In one of his biggest venues, Izzard holds nothing back, leaving your sides aching from laughing so often and so hard. Fantastic, clever, witty...and funny as all get out. I dare you not to laugh."
2,Not very funny,"I purchased this for an Eddie Izzard fan based on the reviews. Unfortunately, neither of us found it funny. Disappointing."
3,Eddie seemed nervous.,"Eddie, got to love him. He's the funniest comic ever but saying that this DVD was not his best. What I think most people miss is that he was very nervous. He was very hyper at the start. He didn't settle down for 20 minutes or more. One of Eddie's true gifts is his ability to take his time to tell a joke and during that time the audience becomes completely invested in everything he has to say. He owns us. He was possibly nervous because most of his audience had never seen him with his breasts. Maybe he wasn't sure how he would be accepted. The spiked heels seemed to be a problem for him. He seemed to have a great deal of difficulty standing up or standing still in them or maybe that was also just part of being nervous. The film quality was not as good as his other DVDs. All in all my husband and I always LOVE Eddie. We would like to see him get some leading rolls in film. He's fabulous."
5,Jazzy Synchronicity,"Sting joins jazz pianist & composer Gil Evans and this recording highlights him in the upper range of his artistic and improvisational artistry. The synergy between Evans and Sting seems to help Sting unleash a raw and passionate power and results in a highly savored live performance. Branford Marsalis makes a guest apearance and adds some superb tenor sax work to the performance.If you enjoy the jazz of Gil Evans, the vocals of Sting and some music from his Police days, you will triple your listening pleasure with this great import which was recorded during a live performance at an Italian Jazz festival back in 1987. The jazz aficionados will detect a few flaws, however the performance remains a well worthwhile and pleasurable listening experience."
5,"Yipee yo, got the Last Sessions!",This is an absolute must have for all Sting/ Jazz fans!The sound/ recording quality of this bootleg is more than decent.
2,Eichmann,"While the main actors in this movie did an excellent job, the movie overall was very disappointing. I was expecting to see a lot more scenes from the past as the primary basis for Eichmann's eventual arrest and trial. Instead, the movie only primarily focused on Eichmann's interviews with his lawyer leading up to the trial."
3,so-so,"I was very interested in seeing Thomas Kretschmann's portrayal of Eichmann. He was excellent in The Pianist and in Downfall as Fegelein. He made this movie with his acting. The story line was not so interesting. It portrayed the Israeli interrogator as a sheepish, insecure individual, which by historic accounts he was not."
1,Eichman,"I can sum this movie up in a word. BORING! Thought it would be a movie about how and what he did during the war but instead it is based on the transcripts of his interrogation by the Israeli's. Did not learn anything. If you want to see a movie about Eichman, buy CONSPIRACY about the Wanse conference now that told you something about him."
1,Schlock - Glad I Bought a Used Copy,"This could have been a good movie. It is nice for me that I didn't pay a whole lot for this piece of junk. As a historical reference there are probably comic books that would do this tragic period in history better justice. The flashbacks to Eichmann's career as a over sexed killer along with his aristocratic Hungarian mistress is pure b.s. The incident where he shoots a infant in his office of all places just dosen't work. Eichmann was a ""desk killer"" who supposedly fainted the first time he saw the dirty end of the death business. The scenes of his interogation with Capt. Less wasn't too bad; the actor who played Eichmann pretty much nailed the appearance but it all ends there.The schlockmeisters who made this rubbish should have hired a historian to at least get some of the dates right. Too many errors to list. Save your money."
5,A Classic Work In American Campagins And Elections,"Lots and lots of books have been written about American campaigns and elections. Many of them have been good and many of them have been not so good. This book is one of the best -- ever. The authors state, in plain English, what is wrong with the Democratic Party and what should be done to fix it. The language of the book is direct and to the point. If the Democrats elect to follow the advice given in this book (and they will not) they will quickly become the majority political party in America, again. If the Republicans are smart (and they are very smart) they will buy up all of the copies of this book and burn them."
4,A Good Recipe for Political Success,"A bit long, a bit preachy, and a bit repetitive, but good to have the anti-Bush invective all in one place.All practicing Democrats need to read this book, or one like it. The Republicans stay on message, and it is a simple message: do anything to win. Democrats need to learn how to do get their own message out. This book has some interesting ideas on how that might be accomplished.I am working with the Democratic party here in Dallas, and you would not believe some of the things they fight about!Ed"
1,A colossal flop,"Unfortunately the mention on the March 9th Drudge Report on what a failure this book has been will probably help it's sales temporarily. If nothing else George Soros and the DNC will now order a couple thousand copies just to boost it's numbers. It was #6661 in total book sales as of March 8th after having been out almost 3 months. Let's see what happens now.But make no mistake, these guys have lost touch with reality. Liberals have lost. ""Take it back"" must be referring to taking this book back to the store for a refund."
1,Saw this book at a Dollar Tree!,Was in a Dollar Tree and saw this book on the shelf. I guess thats the best way to put it in the hands of Democrats!
5,Audizione perfetta,"Egregi Signori,ho ascoltato l'album nella sua interezza e l'audizione è perfetta.Vi ringrazio per l'attenzione.Distintamentedr.claudio castellanovia verdi 220024 Garbagnate Milanese (MI),Italy"
3,"Okay, But Not Complete in My Eyes","The title lead me to believe this book would cover all of Colorado. While the book does have information about a lot of mountain bike rides in Colorado, it is concentrated around the front range and middle of the Rockies. there is little or no information about rides on the Western Slope or San Juans. Alos, a lot of the rides in the book are dirt/forest road type rides instead of singletrack."
4,OmG it's Huge :),"Ordered this for my best girlfriend who is 6'0"" tall, got a longer chain from Silver Insanity too, also excellent quality & fast shipping. It's the biggest locket I've seen that isn't exorbitantly priced. Good quality silver, stamped and all. Plus it isn't too heavy so it will work with 1mm chains. Kinda tough to open, but one can't expect everything. Overall, I'm very pleased and will order from this seller again."
5,Lovely Locket,This is a beautiful locket. For the price it is an outstanding deal. It is lightweight yet has a substantial look to it. I would definitely purchase from this vendor again.
1,Do not buy anything from these thieves,"Do not buy anything from these thieves. I returned my locket to them with the invoice and all the return info and a month later they still have not gotten me my refund. I tried to contact them and they still have not gotten back to me explaining what is going on. Don't buy anything from them, they are dishonest and will steal your money"
3,"Great, but...",The product arrived on time and looked great. Only one problem: it had been polished with some kind of material that left dark marks on my wife's clothing. I wasn't too pleased with that.
1,junk parts,I have put in 3 heater cores in the same car in a month 1/2. Do not be fooled by the picture of this heater it is wrong. They don't how to make a part that will not leka.The ones from napa are the same. Finely used j b weld to stop the leka. Very poorly made.
2,NOT for Domestic Diesels,Be advised this oil is fomulated with aditives that are mapped out for small import diesel engines. It is not intended for use with domestic light or heavy diesel trucks... ei Ford F350etc.
2,Leaked all over,"They sent my 2 orders together in one box and guess what,, one of the bottles leaked all over the inside of the box. I lost about half the bottle and had to clean off all the others, a real PAIN. I hope they will not send all 12 bottles in one box again. and I will see if they will replace the one leaking bottle."
4,Is there somthing Im missing?,"You can buy Valvoline synthetic motor oil of different grades in five quart containers for about $25.00.Ive seen it at Wal mart and Auto zone.Autozone has a deal ware you get the five quarts and a Fram filter for around that much,but I seen reviews that say Fram is Not a good Filter(it used to be).I would find the best local sorce for the oil and buy a high grade filter(like Purolator or Bosh)separatly.Gotta shop around."
5,vw approved oil,"hard to find vw approved oil on the local autoparts shelves..found it here,delivered to my door every 9 months right on schedule. what a great deal and valvoline oil is great motor oil. doesent get any better then that."
4,It works on my Passat B5 so far,The items came on time and it works so far. My Passat has oil sludge problem and has to use particular oil and it works so far after couple weeks.
2,"A mostly cheesy CD, but one awesome track!","When I shop for CDs I don't just look for the latest 'trance smash hits', I look for unique quality. Most of the tracks on here are or once were 'trance smash hits'. We have heard them many times before and we are getting a bit tired of them. Some of them kinda fit the cliche of typical trance tunes. However, there is this one excellent track on this CD that I feel stands alone amongst all the other tracks. Track number 4, as the first reviewer mentioned, is absolutely wonderful. Like the first reviewer, I have not come across this track in any other compilations. In fact, this is the first time I have heard it. I think this is a track that can go on forever. I suppose track number 4 ('Remember' by Rachel Starr), saves it an extra star on my scale... so 2 stars for what would have been a 1."
2,just not my style,"im not much of a trance know-all, but i know what i like and when i bought this cd on a whim....well, lets just say that i was hoping for a lot better. most all of these songs are mixed with vocals and so many of them sound so much the same. i just didnt like it at all. but, you know, thats just because its not my style....though it could be yours."
3,solid trance sampler,"Overall this is a decent selection of some good (mostly vocal) trance songs of the past year or two. I'm not a fan of some track 11 (what where they thinking?) Stay away if you like trance w/out vocals (like tiesto and others) because there are only a few tracks that strike that chord. It is mixed ok, and the song lineup is solid and can definitely be listened to straight through. Tracks 4 and 12 are my favorites on first listen. The cd is full of songs most trance listeners have probably heard here or there. I wish I would have located some of these tracks before. Overall, this is a solid trance cd that deserves a look."
2,More pop than trance,"I bought this CD for ""Freefall"" featuring Jan Johnston, being a fan of her work with Paul Oakenfold. While that song is good, overall it (and the rest of this album) doesn't really seem very trance-like. The majority of the songs definitely are geared towards the more vocal and pop-like aspects of trance, often crossing the boundary so much I wouldn't even classify them as trance any more.Even so, if the songs were good I would have given this album a higher rating. I don't expect every trance CD to be Oakenfold, Sasha & Digweed, or Christopher Lawrence. Unfortunately it's mostly a run-of-the-mill collection of songs; only a couple of are worth a listen, and except for ""Freefall"", they're usually on other and better trance compilation albums. Skip this."
2,Is everyone in this movie on drugs?,"The couple who loses their son hands over a ton of money to creepy guys they don't even know, fork over some more, bad things happen, creepy kids abound, weird scenes that look like LSD trips also abound, and....well, um, I don't know what else to say."
2,"Well shot, plot weak","This movie is very beautiful to look at. It captures misery very well. The jungle scenes are well done. It works very hard to be ""artsy"" but comes off a bit pretentious. The acting is decent for the fairly weak script. The horror comes from the atmosphere and the mood. Both serve to make this film ""interesting"" but not really ""good."""
2,"A boring ""Vinyan""I","I rented this film primarily on the basis of its stars, the beautiful Emmanuel Beart (Manon of the Spring; Coeur de Hiver) and Rufus Sewell (The Illusionist; Dark City). At first the suspense of trying to find their child was intense but as the film progressed, I gradually lost interest in whether they would find their child since it started to become very tedious watching them slough the mud and losing their connections. I looked at the ""Special Features"" and though it may have been pleasurable for the actors, this viewer was left in the lurch. The only thing that caught my interest at times was the lovely Beart who had a brief nude scene with Sewell but outside you may as well ""Appocalypse Now"" instead of this tedious film."
1,probably the worst movie I've ever seen.,"This movie was painful to watch. The only reason I kept watching was to see if the couple ever found their child. Well, that was a complete waste of time. The only memorable thing about this movie was the amount of tits shown & I will never get the image of about 20 young boys rubbing mud all over the lady & squeezing and groping her titties while she giggles and moans. Unless you are a pedophile, you will probably not like it."
1,One of the worst movies of all time...,"watched this movie out of curiosity and both my wife and i regret it.. we fast forwarded through a quarter of the movie and were hoping for some extraordinary turn-around that never took place... we've been to thailand and it definitely does not make the movie any better...on a side note, emmanuelle beart is a great actress but you just want to punch her face in during the movie. really, this movie is so bad, it is almost funny. it is so bad that people who get together to play the worst b-movies should showcase this as the main event. i would give it negative stars if i could."
3,Vinyan,"The trailer caught my eye so i bought the movie online few days later. Hmm... I'm not real sure what to say about it. I love French movies, especially the horror ones. I got confused and during the whole movie, Emmanuelle Beart said almost nothing and looked like she was in a heavy daze... a lady on a mission I should say. It's a mix bag for me. I think the movie was interesting and I would watch it again.You have to watch it and decide if it's good or not, cause I'm at a lost."
3,An unusual human story,"I find this Thailand story with horror sidelooks well worth my time.It's not a great movie, but it has a feeling you don't find every day."
1,Frightfully Boring.,"Like some of the other reviewers, I saw this movie expected it to be an undiscovered gem. The premise is very intersting and I'm a fan of Rufus Sewell. The only thing scary about this film was how boring it was. The director lingers way too long on scenes with no dialogue and random images. Possibly to make up for the total lack of story or characters to care about. I kept waiting for the film to pick-up and do something that made sense. One thing that would have made sense is for the lead male character to leave his crazy, pouty-mouthed wife in the jungle to talk to the trees. But alas, we're expected to believe that a pampered European couple could wander aimlessly through the jungles of Southwast Asia without running into anything worse than a pack of children with pointy sticks. Yes, the imagery was intriguing but I could have gotten that from a documentary film about Burma which would have been more interesting. However, a bowl of cereal would have been more interesting."
1,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!,"Don't bother to even pick this up and read the back. This movie was disturbing, boring, confusing, and horrible!!!! Only kept watching it because I needed to know what happened to their kid. Never did find out!!!!! Made no sense!!!!"
3,VINYAN,"VERY HAUNTING FILM (*****CINEMATOGRAPHY) ABOUT A HUSBAND ACCOMPANYING HIS WIFES DESCENT INTO MADNESS TRYING TO FIND HER SON WHO SHE BELIEVES SURVIVED A TSUNAMI(?)VERY CREEPY JOURNEY INTO A PRIMAL JUNGLE AREA RULED BY ABANDONED(?) CHILDREN LIVING A 'LORD OF THE FLIES' SURVIVALIST EXISTENCE.NOT UPLIFTING, BUT FULL OF GREAT ACTING BY SEWEL AND BEART AND SUPPORTING CHARECTORS. NO CLUE AS TO HOW THEY CAME UP WITH SUCH A GRIM STORY LINE."
2,becomes harrowing,"This film is ok if you are looking for a disturbing, harrowing film. I felt it went on longer than it should have.It was well acted and filmed. The characters were convincing, but after an hour, it was just too depressing and harrowing.The score was horrendous. It seemed that appropriate music was written, but recorded in a distorted style, much like how music becomes when played too loud for the equipment it is played on. Lots of feedback and hiss.You knew by the first ten minutes that there will be not much good out of this film."
5,Great book on a Great band!,"It seems you have to be a really good blink 182 fan to appreciate this book. I luved it! It gives you great info on the band w/ lots of great pics. It has a lot of magazine quotes but so what! That just makes it easier so you don't have to go find them urself. Give the guy a break. He had a lot of time and effort so he made a book on one of the most popular bands out there. He's probably making sum money off of it too. Who cares if he got some stuff out of the video. That just gives people an idea of what to expect. If u need info on Blink 182, or are just a really big fan, i suggest u get this book. The video is just for laughs and ur enjoyment. The book gives u a great idea of the potty mouth punk phenomenons these guys really are!"
1,This is not The Official Blink 182 Book !,"I recently bought this book and though it was alright. I didn't need it but wanted it because it was Blink 182. On June 21 in Oakland, CA at The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show, I met Mark Hoppus from Blink 182 and showed him this book. ""This book is so faulty."" is what Mark said about it. He looked at every page and then signed it. All I have to say is that it's not okay to try and make money by writing a book off a band you think you know with faulty info! Don't be surprised if this book is no longer available!"
3,"Decent content, irritating phonetics","I like the gist of this story, but it's maddening to read aloud to my children, as every main character has a name that sounds very much like the next one's. Did the four most recurrent names in this book really have to be Tommy and Mommy and Molly and Mama-Lu? And with so many M names already, did the teacher have to be Ms. Marston?"
3,For older kids,Bought it along with several other books to reassure my son with 2 lesbian mommies but it was too mature for him. I think this will be more understandable over age 6.
1,not ready for Sony Playstation in Germany,"I'm disappointed about this product, because i ordered it in US for germany. After 20 days, i got it. But it isn't possible to use it, because my Sony Playstation (with all updates!) couldn't play it :-(it shows: ""wrong country code""!!!"
3,Predictable Movie,"Bought it for my son and he loved it. The plot was not bad, and watching the movie on my hdtv was great. However it was predictable."
3,Hmmmm,"Well, speaking as a movie buff I truly enjoyed the movie for what it was worth. It was definitely more of a dance movie than ""stomping"" or ""stepping"". They showed WAY more of the dance scenes. As a member of the Greek community I was disappointed. Although the characters kept saying it wasn't about the competition...that is all they talked about. Hollywood hardly ever gets it right when they try to make movies and sitcoms about Greek life. Many of the people making it aren't Greek so they just report what they see from a distance. There was a Kappa who actually helped choreograph a lot of the stepping scenes and he did a great job. I just would have liked to see more of it and maybe had them talk about where stepping comes from and why it is important to the Black Greek community."
4,Loved it,"I was really hesitant about buying this dvd because I thought it was just another crazy dance movie, but I was pleasantly surprised not only does it have great acting, but the dance moves were a lot different from the norm. While the plot was fairly preditable, it highlighted the road to redemption fopr a youth (DJ) who was heading no where fast. Certainly the writing could be a bit better, but where did the writers say that this movie was suppose to be thought provoking. Its simply an entertaining movie with a lot of dancing. Sometimes, we try to criticise for the sake of it but we often misconstrue the purpose of the movie, which I think in this case was to simply entertain. Was I entertained? Hell yeah! And having to look at someone as handsome as Columbus Short sure helped me along the way."
3,Worth Viewing,"My husband and I watched the movie last night. We enjoyed the dance scenes. Parts of the story reminded us of other movies like Drumline and The Program.Overall, I would recommend watching it. It is a movie that the whole family can watch (except for the shooting scene). Watching it brought back memories of college days at the various step shows."
3,Deja vu...,I agree with most reviews. This is a very light film that bears a striking similarity to Drumline--more than striking--practically identical. The stomping is amazing and is the film's saving grace. There's really nothing much else to say.
2,Bad movie,"I wanted to give this a try even though I wasn't sure what it was about. Very disapointed in the movie. Bad acting, bad story, bad dancing."
5,good movie,"a very good movie, I recommend this product, the quality is great,;dancing parts are the best in the movie, thanksbest regards"
4,Stomp the yard,Great story awesome dancing love chris browm and columbus short I ve watch this movie five times. Neyo good in acting dancing and singing as chris brown is
4,Stomp the yard is good entertainment,I really enjoyed the modern dance and choreography of this style of movie and the level of excitement it promoted.
5,Quality,"I received my order very quickly.The DVD is like brand new; no scratches or glitches at all.I like shopping Amazon for videos for my children.I get to find older movies that I watched as a child and expose my children to them.While you have to wait a few days rather than shopping in a store, you beat store prices almost everytime AND the selection you have to choose from is greater than a store."
1,Never got it to review it.,I have yet to recieve my movie. It has been over thirty days since I ordered it.
3,Doing the Right Thing,"The choreography is visually impressive and carries a mostly plodding script on tragedy, redemption and the power of friendship/love which centers on DJ Williams (Columbus Short) and his journey from Los Angeles to Truth University in Atlanta.Williams is torn from his family after an evening that goes terribly wrong - his brother is murdered in the aftermath of an underground krumping competition - and his mother sends him to Atlanta to live with an aunt and uncle.There is tension on the campus grounds as Williams pursues his love interest, April Palmer (Meagan Good), while attempting to achieve new personal growth, though his talent in dancing may ultimately prove to be the path to triumph.The morality play has no real twists that would keep the ending in suspense, though the message of doing the right thing - no matter what the odds - is refreshing."
4,Love the stomp,"Say what you want about the storyline, the acting, whatever... you know you cheered for the under dog. To manage making a black movie with no sex, moderate violence, promoting higher education, unity and brotherhood, come on, you got to love it, especially in these days and times."
4,"Light, Simple and Fun!","If your looking for earth shattering acting, deep character development and a moving plot -erk- then what the heck are looking at dance movies for?!?! Sure this movies has been done before - isn't this a remix/make of You've Been Served with the newest crop of R&B/dancer hot-boys? Now if want ear-shattering! Then this IS the movie for you! I had a ball trying to learn some of the rump-shaking moves after. And I definately had to add some new workout songs from the soundtrack to my IPod - Let's Go by Trick Daddy is hot!"
3,Stomping at its best!!!!,"Entertaining movie with the same plot as every other dance-off movies. Someone gets in trouble, punished in some way, finds success battling or stomping and then finds love."
4,How long can you listen to banging?,"My younger boy, apparently, for a loooong time. This is definitely getting your money's worth of entertainment. I enjoy the artistry, creativity and the musicality of Stomp, but after a while, I was ready for a break! Definitely worth purchasing."
5,Stomp the Yard,"After the death of his younger brother, a troubled 19-year-old street dancer from Los Angeles is able to bypass juvenile hall by enrolling in the historically black, Truth University in Atlanta, Georgia. But his efforts to get an education and woo the girl he likes are sidelined when he is courted by the top two campus fraternities, both of which want and need his fierce street-style dance moves to win the highly coveted national step show competition.I really enjoyed this movie, and I appreciated the fact that lessons could be learned from such a movie. In my opinion it is a must see if you want a refreshing change. A nod must be given to choreographer Dave Scott, who skillfully blends the dance styles into an explosive whole."
2,"dancing was tight,but generic film","this film was basically a Broke ""school Daze meets Drumline meets You got Served. alot of cliches and the film never has a real idenity. the sentiments of the brother going on without his Brother and going to the ATL(Atlanta) to college and trying to find himself. the film on a whole didn't have anything original to it. I dug the stepping,but the story-line got old rather quickly."
1,Be Careful Before Buying,"When i purchased this blu-ray, it was listed as brand new. When i received it, the disc came in paper sleeve. The blu-ray had fingerprints on the dics. This was defiantly not brand new. I emailed the seller and never got a response. I would not purchase from this seller again."
4,Decent set of headphones,"These work very well for landscaping as well as at the shooting range. I haven't had any problems with it when using my MP3 player. However, the one gripe I have with the product is that the volume control doesn't allow it to go up very high. I understand it's for user protection, but it wouldn't be too bad to increase the volume capacity just a bit."
1,not a pictured,The description is not the same as the picture. I don't know what costume I'm buying! I'll change my review when you change your picture/description.
5,Amazing costume,"Quality, fitting and sizing are very satisfactory. The belt is very good and everything looks durable. Very good choice indeed."
2,Too small!!!,I ordered this for my 9 year old and thought a medium would fit her. She wears an 8 right now....The body suit was wayyyy too tight. The pants could not even go down to her feet. We scrapped the outfit and are just using the belt (which was very big and had to rig to fit her waist!) and the cape. Waste of money!
4,Must have cd for Edgar Winter's cover of Magic Carpet Ride,"While the rest of the cd isn't really my thing, the first track is a smokin' cover Steppenwolf's Magic Carpet Ride by Edgar Winter which was never released anywhere but on this soundtrack. Since the cd can be had for pennies more than the shipping, it was totally worth the couple bucks for this one song."
1,A very odd book,"Dr. Fink passed away a number of years ago, however he shall always be remembered for his vanguard backlash of America's trend towards the dismissal of circumcision as a routine birth ritual. I only wish we could have a book reviewing the late doctor's obsession with this topic and is admitted hours in the library amassing pro-circumcision papers.The book is no longer available which is acceptable since I did read it and found it not worth the paper it was written on."
4,Excellent Lundberg Rice Cakes,"We were very pleased to be able to purchase unsalted Lundberg rice cakes from Amazon. We sometimes buy them from Whole Foods but they do not always have the product and we are stuck with the inferior super market brands. Lundberg rice cakes are the absolute best, by far, in the marketplace. What differentiates them from the competition is their density, body and superior taste. My wife sprinkles unsweetened cocoa powder on them for a treat. If you are a sugar addict do not try this.However, we did have a problem with the outer box from the shipper. It had a large stain across one fourth of the bottom of the box. It looked oily. Thankfully, however, there was an inner box and the stain did not penetrate that far. This may have been the fault of the delivery company."
4,Good but break easily,These are good rice cakes but they crumble easy. Very good with peanut butter or choc chips.
5,Best Rice Cakes,"This is the best product on the market and my dog has one of these daily. They are great, salt and glutin free ----- You won't be disappoinnted."
2,Great if you are a personal assistant - not so great for an administrative assistant,"This book is very good if you are going to be working as a personal assistant or for a very high level executive. If you are an Administrative Assistant for anything other than the White House, a Hollywood star, or a top level executive at a Fortune 500 company, this book doesn't really relate to you. I've worked as an Admin Asst for a large public company, a small manufacturing firm and a high school. Almost none of the suggestions applied to me. It was easy reading but really only applied to very high level or personal assistants. Also, the author related how what she learned allowed her to move up the corporate ladder and even go into business for herself. For someone who is looking to work as an Admin Asst for their foreseeable career, this book doesn't give you anymore information than you already know. Not a bad book, but keep in mind who it's geared toward."
2,An OK Book,"The writer has great style and all, but it's really written for newcomers to this profession.I was impressed by the title of the book. I like the presentation. But what's really lacking is the content when I dig into it. I had reasonably high expectation of the book, that it's for the 'take-your-career-to-the-next-level' readers (seasoned office professionals). However, it disappoints me in this department.The information provided, particularly in the ""Appendix"" is relevant to the US, but may not be the case for other parts of the world. The concepts and principles are useful. Having worked and still do, in large American corporations, I find it easy to relate to the book.Having said all that, it still makes a GREAT book for everyone who is NEW and ASPIRES to be the BEST admin you could possibly be - A KICKASS ASSISTANT. Happy reading!"
4,Executive Assistant,This is a great resource for anyone interested in getting a start in the world of administrative and executive assistants. The book's packed with the basic information needed to be successful in this field. It's even a good review for the experienced assistant.
3,"Ditto: An ""OK"" Book","This was a great book for a broad overview, but there really wasn't enough detail for more seasoned assistants to dig in and pull out any real 'nuggets of gold.'"
1,One star only because it won't let me give a NO STAR rating...,"Don't waste your time or money. This book is totally out of date due to technological changes. Not the author's fault, but still... Her concepts may be valid, but her applications mean nothing in today's workplace. I mean, I don't need a 4 inch 3 ring binder in my hand at all times so that I can look up contact names, phone numbers, etc. for my boss. (Think Blackberry, IPhone...)The story line she followed was pretty self-absorbed, too. The author seems to think that readers will be really impressed with her name dropping, anyone ever involved in the Clinton administration. Like that gave her more credibility than, say, Bill Gate's assistant.All in all...a secretary in the 1920's would have found this book more useful than an assistant in the 21st century will. It's just completely outdated."
5,"Thank you, Heather!","Before getting a job as an assistant at an International Organization, I had almost no idea what an assistant was supposed to do. I remember telling myself ""I wish I had a guide for this!""Well, Heather Beckel's book was the guide I needed! I am very indebted to her because her advice helped me during every step of the process, from my very first days at the desk to negotiating a raise.This book helped me know what to expect, how to organize myself, what to be aware of, and how to read my boss.For me, this was a very useful read and I recommend it for anyone who, like me, had little idea of what being a good assistant involved."
4,Ayler-influenced Brazilian jazz,"Ivo Perelman is a passionate tenorist who's played with William Parker, Matthew Shipp and others in the NY avant-garde jazz scene. Here on his 1989 debut recording he plays with more mainstream players (including Elaine Elias, John Patitucci, Peter Erkstine, and Airto). Each track is based on a Brazilian folk song, which Perelman uses as a basis for improvisation that is Ayler influenced but also melodic at times. The all-star cast goes a little further ""out"" than on their own commercial releases, and everything comes together quite nicely. Especially for the low used price this is currently being offered for on Amazon, I would recommend this to anyone interested in improvised music that is not easily classified. Don't let the awful cover confuse you, this is unique and beautiful music worth acquiring."
2,Expected something different.,"This book just didn't inspire me to weave wheat. Perhaps, I was looking for designs that weren't included. Good chance that others make like it, I just didn't."
2,Not What I Expected,"Since receiving the product, I have completed two sessions. The first session was uneventful. I read and followed the directions, but did not peel. I waited two weeks after the first session to do another peel. This time I felt a stinging sensation, but that was it. My skin looks smoother but I wanted to actually see the peel of the old skin. I'll give it a third try in about a week. If nothing happens, I will try another product."
4,A work in progress,My skin is soft as silk but I'm waiting for the dark spots to go away. I may need a few more weeks as mentioned in the directions.
3,Good,"I have used glycolic acid 40% in the past which is very harsh! In comparing that to this, this is very gentle thus the results are not as noticable but I've only been using this about 2 weeks. Call me crazy, but I think I see results. The hyperpigmentation is lightening although no one has given me any compliments yet. That is the real true test when someone else notices. In reading some other reviews, people are seeing better results within a month so it's just rated ""okay"" for now."
3,Its okay,"It does burn a lot. There isn't a whole lot of difference in skin, if any. We'll see I suppose."
1,70% lactic,Sadly it did nothing. 70% sounds effective but I had zero results. I would have sent it back but waited to use it since I thought I would peel. I am ordering another product from this co. I hope the TCA works.
1,either a bad batch or a joke,"I did not even experience the slightest tingling when left on face for 4 minutes as instructed. This is supposed to be 70% acid. I should feel it. With a hint of optimism, I'm returning for another bottle. But I am not setting my hopes high. Who knows, maybe I just got a bad batch."
1,useless,"a complete joke. am starting to question any good review of this product. felt a tingling but that's it. left it for almost 30 minutes the second time i used it to have some effect still useless. no peeling, no improvement. its up to you to buy but for me its a complete waste of money."
3,Didn't know what to expect,"I'm a junkie for face products, always on the search for something to renew troubled skin. I bought this at the same time I purchased the 30% glycolic product from the same company. The lactic 70% does what it should, I suppose, but despite not having sensitive skin (in the least), I tend to peel much longer with this one and don't experience the same ""glow"" I get from the glycolic. I probably should have gone with a lower strength, but will likely just stick to the glycolic instead. The company that makes both these products (Skin Laboratories) is a fine company though. Product was delivered on time and as expected."
3,"NO RESULTS YET, BUT STILL EXPERIMENTING","I am light skin, yellow toned african american. Compared to the glycolic, and salsylic peels, i would say this is the strongest one that i have felt, and my skin is pretty tough. It has reddened my scars, but the redness is clearing now. I took a picture of the before and i will take another one when i do an update review. So far no changes, but i am being patient and trying not to expect miracles."
2,"What works for some, may not work for others","I hate to give this a low rating because i'm sure it worked for other people. It just wasnt right for me. I thought by getting 70% that id have a good enough strength to see some results, however...it didnt do anything. I felt like NOTHING was happening on my skin. I probably wouldnt get this if you're used to having things put on your skin...be it a peel or any other topical liquid or cream. I'm sure for those of you who dont exfoliate or, if you dont do much at all...this will be fine for you. I will say, though, that the people that work there were very helpful. They answered each question that I had within 24 hrs and always tried to help me further than I asked for. Great customer service!"
2,disappointed,"I didn't see any difference after using this product. I have had lactic acid peels done at a spa & I had great results, my skin peeled, & it looked really great.. this peel did absolutley nothing for my skin, no peeling, no changes at all.. would never by this one again"
2,Did no harm,"Two stars for not causing any damage but not doing anything useful, either. I saw no difference in my sun and age-related spots, and no increased glow or anything. Whatever it did at a cellular level didn't show up anywhere I could see it. This was my opinion of a few products I tried over the last year or so."
1,"Good Seller, Bad Product","I have used skin laboratory in the past, and they are always fast and helpful. They are a good company, but this is a product review and the simple truth is that this peel is low quality. I've used lower stregth lactic acid in the past (from skin lab and other companies). This is very weak and not worth the time and money. Obviously skin sensitivity varies from one person to the next, so it might work better for others. But if you are an ""experienced"" peel user, and working up to stonger acids for more improvement I would advise you to look elsewhere."
1,Got Red Bumps on my face,"Am I ALLERGIC to this stuff??Just to be extra careful, since this was ""70%"", I tried it just on ONE side of my face (left). The next day I had a bunch of little red bumps on my face (left side).Here it is, a month later, and the little red bumps are still there!I will NOT use this again.Edit:It is now April 12. I have been waiting since February for these red bumps to go away. They are s-l-o-w-l-y- diminishing.Clearly, something is wrong. Either I'm allergic to this stuff or it's just too strong for my face. Definitely going in the trash. No 2nd chances on this one!"
2,"Scary product, peeled my skin off, caused serious burn, buyer beware","The item was shipped very fast. I read the instructions and applied the peel as stated. This was my first peel, so I was extra careful. The first sample peel went fine. When I applied the lactic peel, it literally peeled my skin off. I was fortunate to apply to a small area. Lost 2 inches of my skin. I am brown in color. So area that got burnt is pale white and the rest of my skin in brown. Scary..I sent emails to these guys, got an auto response with no followup. If I were to use this product, would ensure its over a long holiday, so any burns, peels, hideous injuries, can heal itself without all the glare from people...The pain is unbearable even after you flush with water for ever...I would recommend, first time applicants to go to a salon and have it done and slowly work your way towards doing it yourself. This product has very high concentration of acid and show not be taken lightly."
2,Not good for me,"It did peeled, but that's it, my skin is not clear it all, i've been using this for 3 months."
1,Did not delivered as the reviews stated,This is my second try of chemical peels from Amazon and has to admit that both products did not work.I read most of the review and is wondering if the producer of the product wrote those reviews.
3,Not a one Size Fits all,"I hate to give this a bad mark, since it seems to work for some people and the company is great. Alas, this did not work for me. This was my first purchase from Skin Laboratory & it wrecked my face completely. I only had it on less than 5 mins. I had scabs and burns all over my face for a week. BTW, I've been using Glycolic acid wash/moisturizer for years. I also had a professional Salicylic Acid peel and that also wrecked my face. I guess I just can't do anything besides Glycolic Acid. I've been using their GA peel 35% peel, after my face healed from the LA, with great results. Regardless of the report that Lactic Acid is gentler than Glycolic, if you are not accustom to this type of acid or this level, be very cautious. Also, a neutralizer is a must. A Baking Soda solution works fine."
3,"Potent and it works, but be careful with it","I'm a licensed esthetician and decided to try it. My skin is pretty much primed for high potency peels. I would only recommend leaving this peel on for 2 MINUTES. Anything over that is playing with fire. It is strong and you need to make sure to remove all of the product once rinsing your face. I would recommend, after using face wash to remove, a solution of ice water and baking soda to neutralize the acid, but all in all, I do like the product and the results are visible."
2,why does my skin has bright spots where scar is,i have short brown scar on my thigh i used this product and my skin keeps pealing and where my scar is is just a bright spot where u can see my skin in removed is this suppose to work like this? but i dont see scar fading should i continue to use this product? help please
5,Works!,"Moved up to the 70% solution as I have quite a bit of sun damage to my arms. It will take a while, but I can see evidence that the spots are disappearing. I use the 50%, sometimes 70% on my face. As a Retin-A user, the higher dosage doesn't seem to bother me. Price is good. For what I'm using it for, I'd certainly recommend it."
4,Pretty Good,"It seemed to do the trick. I did feel alittle stinging after about 45 seconds, but it didn't bother me. I counted to 180 and rinsed non stop for 60 seconds to be sure I got everything.I did not have a toning cleanser (which is required) but I used alcohol instead. My face felt smooth afterwards.I didn't notice a big difference, but other people did.Just be sure to apply moister after (petroleum jelly, shea butter, vit E Oil, or Retinol Cream a.k.a. Vit A) These are the 4 best oils/creams to put on fresh clean and new skin cells. They help the process of the mini peel and they do not badly clog up the pores."
2,Good but....,I have dark skin with hyperpigmentation. This did nothing for my skin as far as making the pigmentation any better...No difference at ALL.It is good however for making the skin feel smooth and supple and it unclogs the pores. When I find something that actually does get rid of the hyperpigmentation I will use this to maintain the results but until then I need something strong...even at 70% it is EXTREMELY mild.
3,cookie cutter,"I bought this cutter to make mini tarts. the ""petals"" are too thin to make sides of tarts. It probably would work just fine for sugar cookies."
5,EXCELLENT VIDEO FOR SENIORS!!!,"Great video for seniors or younger. One can increase weights to make the workout more intense. The atmosphere is non-competitive unlike many other exercise videos -work at your own pace, and listen to your body. It also features ""normal-looking"" seniors and not ""super-model"" types. This video is HIGHLY recommended, and I've spent a small fortune trying them ALL!!! This is the BEST video for seniors I've found."
3,Storytelling in a near-revolt universe,"Having already read the first two books in chronological order, the third book surprised me as not being a chronological sequel to the preceding book. Refreshing though, it was, that what was presented was a series a short stories which where tied into an interesting plot.The short stories are actually myths and parts of storytelling. The stories provide original forms of art in the universe created by Somtow. The entire feel of the book is fantasy-like, rather than science fiction. Good addition to the series, sets the stage for the final book."
4,"Good Story, but the Bilingual is Better","I have greatly enjoyed this anime series. The antics of Keitaro keep getting him into trouble with the girls in his house. Eventually they grow to love him, and you will too. On the other hand, I have read both this version of the Love Hina series and the Bilingual version. While the text is almost identical, the bilingual version translates the in frame descriptions off to the side. Things like ""chop chop"", ""ashamed"", etc are only translated in the bilingual. Beyond that, the bilingual version is printed on higher quality materials and features the outer cover common to manga, which the english version does not. Also, all of the volumes are available in the bilingual form, so you dont have to wait until december to get 6, 7, and 8. So, my final summary is that the story is very amusing, but you should get it in the bilingual form, which can be found online for only [$$] more."
5,ONE OF THE BEST TRAVEL BOOKS--EVER,O'HANLON CAN WRITE LIKE A DEMON AND THE WHOLE JOURNEY IS RATHER ON THE DEMONIC SIDE. HAVE READ IT MORE THAN ONCE AND BOUGHT THIS COPY FOR A GIFT. WANT TO GET REALLY AWAY THIS WINTER? READ THIS AND ALL HIS BOOKS.
2,Disappointed,"Perhaps, it's just my misunderstanding of a particular British sensability (I have enjoyed travelogues by other British writers),but I couldn't avoid the feeling that this author wrote this one while sitting, comfortably in a arm chair, poring over 18th and 19th accounts of Amazon travelers and making it up as he went. I'm sure he made the trip, but his style seemed to be finding as many adjectives as posible to describe every twig in his path. Half-way through, I just settled for speed-reading, looking for something with some meat. In fairness, I will read others by same author and perhaps change my mind. Maybe, his heart just wasn't in this one."
3,Wit somewhat overstated,"I like adventure. I also like a witty approach to writing, but this book seems to fall a little short in the humor category as it was hyped out to be. Forced and anxious would be a better description.Nonetheless, O'Hanlon's escapades into uncharted Venezuelan Amazon River systems do bear fruit. From tolerating and coping with the many dangers of uncivilized jungle environs to befriending the fierce and violent Yanomami tribe, the author certainly has achieved what many would rather accomplish from an armchair.The ending was abrupt and rather inconsiderate to the reader. It was as if the author's ""writing"" canoe just capsized."
3,Half of a good book,"In the first half of this book, with the constantly hillarious Simon as a foil, Hanlon is hilarious. Through Simon's eyes and comments the reader can see the hilarity and, oftentimes, insanity of Hanlon's quests. But once Simon bugs out, Hanlon loses his reality check. The reader sees only Halnon's relentlessly cheery description of a journey that can only be becoming more unpleasant. Without Simon along to tell how it really is -- bizarre, unpleasant, and often painful -- the book loses its edge and becomes a mostly tedious recitation of the birds and plants seen along the way. The first half of the book would, by itself merit four or five stars, but the dull ending drags it down to three."
5,"Enjoyable, informative, humorous.",I enjoyed reading this book; it was well-written. I learned a lot too; the author gives detailed accounts of his adventures as well as the plant and animal life that he encounters. Humor is sprinkled throughout the book; there are some really funny parts. There are also some parts that will really gross you out. It's great! The only drawback is the ending. It ends rather abruptly. I still wonder if he ever made it back home or if only his notes made it!!!
4,Works,"Have only used once but nice to have. I think Home Depot has 24"" ones, so these are extra beefy. Maybe should have looked into a small hydraulic one before I bought these. You really have to lean hard on the levers on hardened lock shackles, but you can cut them as long as you are pretty strong."
3,spike aerator,my wife bought this spike aerator for christmas from amazon.com sold by agri-fab. since it is the middle of winter i was unable to use the product. assembling this product was as easy as it gets. when i received the aerator one of the lock nuts was busted. i contacted the customer service department and they had me jumping through hoops just to have them send a 25 cent lock nut. it wasn't worth the hassle so i went to the local hardware store and bought a bag of lock nuts. i recommend buying brinly-hardy products instead.
4,"yep, it's the packaging and sound.....","On closer listening I realised this release of Cowboy In Sweden was mastered from very worn vinyl, which is a shame because the actual recording and mixing is very atmospheric. Still, the scratchy, muddy sound adds its own texture in an era of pristine digital reproduction...This album was apparently hastily compiled from a number of different sources, which accounts for the number of different singers (where did Suzi Jane Hokom come from? and go to?) and Swedish/non-Swedish material. Whatever, it's classic stuff, but Smells Like Records could have done a better job with the sound and annotation. If there's no other way of getting this album it's an essential buy."
5,Indian delight!,"Since I'm not very innovative as far as cooking is concerned, I usually need the help of a cookbook to get me through any meal I prepare. Ever since I got this book and started trying out the recipes, it has changed the way I view cooking. The book is meticulously laid out, has a casual matter-of-fact approach to the preparation and best of all, the end product is delicious! [I like that the author throws in little helpful hints within a recipe - like the one about sprinkling water to prevent onions from sticking to the bottom of the pan while sautéing. I certainly never knew that...]Suvir Saran deserves a pat on the back for including recipes that one does not usually find in most other cookbooks or restaurants. Can't wait for the next volume!"
2,Don't let the title fool you...,"When I purchased this book I was hoping for 'authentic' Indian recipes and was disappointed to find they were not. Many recipes make substitutions instead of using the original ingredients; or the recipes are 'modified' from the original.The author also includes a number of NON-Indian recipes in this book [especially in the dessert section]. What on earth are they doing in here?? How does this relate to 'Indian Home Cooking'??You also get a lot less recipes than you bargain for since many recipes are just slight variations of each other. I would have preferred more and different dishes.Of the dishes I have tried, none of them have been very outstanding and are not worth repeating."
2,Adjusted for Americans,"I don't like this book, because it is too adjusted to Western taste-buds. Why go thought all the work to learn about a new cuisine go to ethnic supermarkets just to produce dishes that somebody considers suitable for American. Why not go more for the real thing? Or at least a book that would present the real thing alongside the Americanised/simplified version.Furthermore, there is no attempt to teach anything about Indian cuisine as if such a term really existed. The country is pretty big. We get some decent and some super simplified recipes. Honestly, what is the point of just removing the 20 minute soaking of the basmati rice before cooking? We are just told that the author uses this simplification. Sure the book can be useful for people who do not know anything about Indian cooking. However, I would direct those people to the web instead. For those of us in search for something more genuine this book is not for us."
5,Deliciously Accessible!,"I have about 250 cookbooks. I had two Indian cookbooks in my collection, which just collected dust. Not so with Suvir Saran's ""Indian Home Cooking""! I'm a member of a cookbook club. Five of us wanted to explore ethnic cooking and this book was our first selection. We have enjoyed four dinner parties to which we each brought two dishes from this book. We were impressed with each of the forty dishes we tried, eventhough we're all new to Indian cooking. The beautiful illustrations and clearly written recipes led to success in tackling a new cuisine. The chapter introductions provide insights to important ingredients and techniques. Each recipe has an introduction which might give family anecdote, insight into regional differences, or serving suggestions and variations. I highly recommend this book to anyone who thinks Indian cooking is intimidating. You will discover a rich culinary tradition, so accessible and delicious; it will become part of your everyday cooking."
2,Review from a seasoned cook of Indian origin...,"Ok, so I bought this book as one of the first additions to my limited cookbook collection. Obviously I was looking for different ideas and techniques than what I'm accustoemd to. For non-Indians this could be a good introduction to Indian cooking. However it would be quite a disappointment for Indians. It is full of useless pictures of spices and unconvincing anecdotes and the recipes are close variations of eachother. The rice cooking technique makes the rice sticky unless you add butter(not mentioned), which I'm sure most pro chefs do, but is not a good idea for everyday home cooking. If you've been cooking for a while then you can tell right away by looking at the recipes that they are only meant to sound exotic but are neither authentic nor will they be edible unless you make serious modifications of your own...basically not worth it."
4,True Stanko!,"What I like about Stanko is he doesnt rely on one style... like Dave Douglas. Those masters know how to float from one universe to another with great success. Here, the context is electronic impros. It's new, it's fresh and needs to be listened on an almost audiophile sound system. (let's just say that you need a little bit of depth in sound so a very good pair of speakers will help.. no headphones, this music needs space). The trumpet is definitly Stanko's. Deep and rich sounds, glissandos, silences, high notes and all that east european feeling that talks right to your heart. To be listened many times and not for all ears. Love it!"
3,Not for me,"Delivery etc was up to usual Amazon standards. However, the book content was aimed more at the academic reader, rather than someone wishing to understand Nigeria before they travel there. So, from my viewpoint, the book didn't hit the spot. However, it may be for you.."
3,Does not fit the AV700,The case is very good but it does not fit the AV700 model. I think the photo is very deceiving. The description does not specify what models fit in the case either.
1,sucks,"The peter pan child costume is not worth the money. The Hat is too small(size 4) and it ripped in two weeks. The material is like felt, very disappointed"
3,Durable but not useful,Cheap way to buy dumbells but if you have worked out much before you will understand these sorts of dumbells leave alot to be desired-there is something about the feel of them in the hand and the oddity of their feel when doing arching movements like flies...they are ok with presses but with flies and curls they disappoint.It might be simply the solid one piece construction that does not allow the weight to shift through an arch but I have noticed the best dumbells in my hands have always been the ones which have multiple small steel plates on each end that fit snuggly together.
5,Works great!,"I purchased these for my 3 year old female yorkie. When I'm at work and there is no one to let her out in the backyard, she uses these pads instead of soiling the floor. I have laminate floors so these work beautifully. I am in the process of purchasing some more. I have not been able to find pads with the peel-off strips anywhere so I was excited when I found these on good ole Amazon. Great product."
1,Order Not Received,Order placed in early January was to be received between February 4th and February 17th. The paperback book has not arrived as of February 20th. I will NOT order through Amazon again.
2,Sicker than it is funny,"""Time After Time"" is a grim book. While I found it to be good for a few laughs, I felt guilty about it later. Molly Keane is a little too skillful at satirizing the tropes of the British-country-house novel, and I suspect her of being a misanthrope. All of Keane's characters are flawed people, to greater or lesser degrees, and I hadn't thought I had sympathy for any of them, but at the end, when the author brutally gave each person what he or she supposedly deserved, I felt a little sick.Joylessness isn't what I look for in a novel like this. I think one would do better to find one's humor somewhere else."
3,Skewed results can happen with any assessment,"This book is probably not the best reading assessment there is, but it is also not the worst. You would really need to take quite a large amount of time to read the book and directions carefully before administering the test. It did help me understand the students fluency. The comprehension questions were still confusing to the student due to the vocabulary. One or two words in the story could throw the student way off track. For example, one story was about a big bad wolf and a woodcutter. The child that has never heard of a woodcutter before didn't know it was an actual person/man. They thought it was an animal like a beaver. Skewed results could happen in any test because of the smallest details observed."
4,great tool,Love this tool. Keep it in the kitchen where it's handy all th time. The only difficulty was figuring out how to put the battery in for the flashlight.
1,NOT Safe- dangerous- DO NOT buy,"If you are using this for very ""light"" screwing applications, it works...requiring very little force.If you put pressure on the screw, the ""bit"" collapses (the design is ""foldable"" which works to its disadvantage), crushing back on your finger (and that really hurts)...i have tested this enough (over a year) to write an unbiased review.The only advantage is that it has multiple bits - 3 Flat, 3 Phillips--so you dont have to change the heads like you would have to when using a screwdriver kit. But the disadvantages (injury) are way over any advantage this tool offers."
2,06/20/00,"This book should not be called ""A Handbook for Interior Designers, it should be called ""Interior Design 101"". This book is a very basic crash course in principles of interior design. I would not recommend this book to anyone who has any background in interior design."
4,"Fun, goofy French rock from the early 1960s","A fab, multi-CD set replicating the original EP releases of this legendary French rock'n'roll band. These guys took their cues from Elvis Presley and Chubby Checker, twisting the night away and covering numerous American rock tunes with goofy French translations, much like Johnny Hallyday in his early career. It's dorky, but fun -- better, actually, than many similar French rock acts. Worth checking out!(...)"
3,Eve's Bayou film music on CD,"Not much to comment on. Actually, I bought this album for the concluding song in the movie. But the album, for whatever reason, does not carry it. A big disappointment. However, overall, very pleasant music."
1,Dead in 1 month,"DO NOT waste your time buying this battery. I used it for less than a month in my cordless telephone, and literally have probably used the phone only twice in that month, and it is completely dead.... won't hold a charge at all."
4,Rechargeable Batteries for Panasonic Cordless Phones,"Since installing the batteries, we no longer get the ""move closer to base station"" error message. They hold their charges well."
5,Just as Described,This item came quickly and was just as described and in the original packaging. I was replacing the original battery that came with the Panasonic answering machine telephone system (8 years old) because the handset would not hold a charge for very long and you could not talk on the phone for longer than 30 minutes without the battery giving out. The new battery is working great and I have had no phone calls disconnected since installing it.
5,Great Item,Didn't think I could find batteries for my phone due to it's age and I was so happy I did
5,Good battery which saved me money,"I was planning on buying a new telephone answering system due to the malfunction of my current phones. Well, a friend recommended that I try to replace the batteries in my phone before venturing out to the store to buy new eqipment. I did so and with the Panasonic replacement batteries which I purchased on Amazon, I saved myself time and money. My phones work fine now and it's all due to a change of batteries."
1,battery,"The battery was DOA(dead on arrival)in it's new and the pretty Panasonic packing. I charged it for 24 hrs and could not revive it. Oh well, R.I.P. I thank whoever I got it thru Amazon, they made the return as hassle and drama free as it gets. I love these guys!!!"
2,"Doesn't work, or maybe just not for me","I thought this would be great, it looks good, feels soft and should be warm inside, but in order to attach to my Honda 300 Fourtrax with regular tubing handlebars, I can just barely get the velcro to close, at an awkward looking angle, and still there is a gap that lets air in the front.If that was it I would be fine with them, but where they make a right angle is right where my throttle is, tight fit, almost too tight to use with gloves which I need since the air comes through it as mentioned above. Then I find ice in between the supposed waterproof layer and the inner liner, so they got even colder, even though I have been careful to close them to keep snow from blowing into them, but in doing so, (not roughly) a tear developed on one side along the seam on the shell right near the hand entrance, after the ice developed inside."
2,NOT THE VICIOUS RUMORS FROM THE U.S.!!,"This cd is not by the band Vicious Rumors that released the classic ""Welcome To The Ball"", ""Digital Dictator"" etc.....this is an English band from the eighties with the same name!!Don`t make the mistake I did!!"
5,Still a fan,"I enjoyed this book even more than the first book in this series. I found the information on the falcons to be interesting and did not take away from the story. I enjoy a good mystery series, and I feel that I have found one that will remain on my list of favorites."
5,Wow...,"I haven't read a detective novel since my Nancy Drew days. Didn't think I'd enjoy them, and besides, my attention span is ridiculously short.I was given a copy of A KILLING SKY last Saturday, so I picked it up, just to have a look, on Sunday evening. It dropped from my hand as I fell asleep in the wee hours of the morning. I picked it up first thing Monday and found myself -- still in my pajamas -- at noontime, when the book ended and finally let me go.If you like the kind of book that grabs you by the lapels and doesn't let go until it's done with you, then A KILLING SKY is just the ticket.-Janis Jaquith, author of BIRDSEED COOKIES: A FRACTURED MEMOIR"
2,Too much the same.,"After the second novel, I gave up. They are too much the same. I love Louise Penny and Michael Connelly.and expected the same, but they are not. I find I know the endings before they come. I bought four on the Kindle because I thought I would like them. I may in the future, but right now they do nothing for me."
5,a powerful collection,"This small assortment of poems would make an excellent gift for a friend who's a therapist. From the point of view of a caring counselor, the passage of time, memories, gifts of nature,coping with death and dying: these are the major themes of Liz Zelvin's poetry. Reading her flowing words is like having an intimate conversation with a newly made friend in the wee hours of the morning. All in all a prized possession."
3,Dream House,"It was different than I expected, it wasn't awful but it wasn't the best I've seen either. Ok movie with a twist."
4,Just Ok,"This movie was definitely fun trying to follow. I actually figured out what was going on about 3/4 of the way through the movie. That may not be saying a lot for me, but if you like the ""Haunted House"" tales with more details then this movie may be for you."
1,This movie gets BAD at the 50 minute mark -- waste of money!,"I regret renting this movie and can tell you that it was interesting until the 50 minute mark -- and then it just made my head hurt. It was a challenge to watch the remaining 40 minutes or so of the movie. I wondered why I had never heard of a movie starring Daniel Craig, Naomi Watts, and Rachel Weitz as they are all big stars --- and the reason this movie was not publicized and I don't even think released into theaters is because it is BAD. Only watch it if it is for free as a Prime member. Do not waste $3.99 on this! I was fooled because the first 50 minutes are interesting, but boy does it go DOWNHILL. It's almost like it was the first half of one script and the second half of another and someone stitched them together!"
1,A Stinker,"Avoid this title and save money. I cannot say anything good about it...the storyline was silly and unbelievable, and everything else was subpar."
3,Mislead,"The problem with this movie is the advertising which make it seem like a horror which it is surely not. It is a psychological thriller/drama. The other big problem is that one of the major twists/reveals was spoiled in one of the previews I saw before another movie. The second twist is not very good. I like Daniel Craig and he does okay with the role, though I did hear him slip in his native accent on more than one occasion. The movie itself just isn't great. It reminds me of a television movie. This is a rental at best."
5,GREAT MOVIE. PS: Don't read the reviews - -too many spoilers,"This is a great film! It has some wonderful twists in it. So - I encourage you to bypass the reviews and just watch the film. It dragged a little near the end, but it was quite suspenseful without gore, blood and senseless violence."
3,Slightly Confused and Spoiled,"To begin, I agree with a lot of other reviewers in the regard that the trailer pretty much spoils the whole movie. It absolutely killed any kind of potential suspense factor for the movie.With that said, I'm still not sure how I feel about the movie. Daniel Craig's acting was a little suspect to me. Maybe it's just his style but sometimes it felt like he was just having conversations with his self and frequently gave off-key, emotionless responses. Beyond that, I'm still really sure what to make of what happened. I got the major storyline. But the way or the order they depicted things left me still confused as to what actually was happening.I give it a 3 because I can't award a 2.5. And the movie probably is better if you just watch it without knowing anything about the story."
1,A rehash of far better films.,Spoilers. Stop if you do not want spoilers. This film is pretty much Shutter Island/The Others redone as an even worse psycho guy/ghost/who done it man unaware film. I did not even enjoy Shutter Island all that much and this was many many notches below that. This concept of a character who does not know who he is has been done enough. Please stop making this film unless it is with a very new unique twist. This film tries to twist it up but it's absurd when it all comes out. I figured it out way before the film explained itself. Thank god I only rented this. There are better films than this out there. Go rent some of them.
5,a great movie,"this movie is so good it will keep you interested every second.you think one thing then you find something so confusing, its amazing.you have to buy this."
1,Predictable and boring.,"As I said, this is so predictable it's ridiculous. I'm not saying there aren't any surprises in the movie, but instead of feeling intrigued and wanting to learn more I just found myself eyerolling at every new twist. As did the friends I sat down and watched this with, the most excited anyone got was in the first 30 minutes when you think there's a murderer outside the house.After the reveal it just goes downhill, the ending was out of nowhere and not in a good way. It's not horrible to sit through one time but I can't fathom how anyone thinks this is a good movie. We've all seen it before. It's The Others meets Shutter Island meets Identity, the timeline is thrown together horribly and the story just wasn't very good to begin with."
2,Ripoff Of Shutter Island,"but takes place mostly outside an asylum. Even the CGI is identical at times. The protagonist seeks answers like: What is my real name? Why do new characters know me? What did they see? Who is real? Who is a mirage? Am I a murderer? If not, who is? Why am I engulfed in flames and not coughing or hot?"
3,Dream House,The story was okay and the acting very good. I would recommend it to my friends. The story was kind of different.
5,"Do a movie, meet your wife","Danie Craig has a good performance in this movie, full of twists and turns and surprises and good entertaining stuff. Plus he meets his future wife on set, so even better!"
2,Disapointing,extremley dissapointing. I had it figured out within the first 20 minutes. Not happy that I paid 4.99 to rent so not worth it :(
3,Great Mystery,"I really enjoyed this movie, it was a great mystery. It was a great surprise. It was totally different from what I was expecting. The actors in this film always deliver."
2,Painfully Dull,"It's never a good sign when your all-star cast flatly refuses to do any promotions for your film whatsoever.DREAM HOUSE suffers from the one thing you simply cannot ever be in the horror movie industry. Dull. Painfully dull.Stars Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz do their best to breathe life into this plodding, predictable mess of a movie, though the advertising company didn't do DREAM HOUSE any favors by revealing the ""Big Twist"" in the trailer.Patrick - ScreamQueenz Horror Blog"
1,"It's Good... Wow, Even Better... then it Sucks....","Craig and company deliver great performances. The acting is top-notch. It starts off interestingly enough - and there are other reviews that'll give the reader more detail, and then it gets REALLY interesting, as the director proves that he bites off more than he can chew, and one has the feeling that somebody needed to up his meds, stop his meds, or in some fashion not panic as he did. It takes thoughtfulness to pull off a Mulholland Drive or Momento. What happens here is a sudden concoction is poured into the viewer's lap to pull all the pieces together that is so sophomoric and un-intelligent, un-creative and flat out-last-minute-i-dont-know-how-to-end-this' so I'll wrap it up this way' piece of mediocrity, that you feel cheated in the shell-game.What is so shocking is that so many millions of dollars can be spent and still allow this mangled jumble to get out the door the way it is."
3,Much better than the critics say,"The only reason I am writing a quick review of this movie is to defend it.It is much better than critics and others have said.It may be faulted for giving away too much a little too early, but the story and acting deserves more credit than this film has received.I have heard that the Director and the actors hated the final cut of the film so much they refused to participate in marketing or interviews for the movie .... and the Director wanted his name removed.That is a lot of animosity.I don't really understand it.I have seen much less entertaining movies that did not suffer this image problem."
1,Prepare for disappointment,"This is one of the worst movies of 2011. Who ever wrote the script, produced and directed this movie should be ashamed. Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz and especially Naomi Watts talents are totally squandered. The advertising for this movie entirely misrepresents what type of movie it is. Don't waste your time or your money."
3,Prayer is good Medicine,Prayer Is Good Medicine: How to Reap the Healing Benefits of PrayerI am always very interested in ways people define and experience prayer.This book was a bit dull for my taste. I believe his first book is better.I'll bet on his last book too. The Extraordinary Healing Power of Ordinary Things: Fourteen Natural Steps to Health and Happiness.There's an interesting list of Prayer groups at the end of this book.
5,More than meets the eye,"This book presents a cogent and insightful analysis of the spirituality of AA. However, it does far more. There is something valuable and helpful in the book for anyone interested in spirituality-- insights about forgiveness, thanksgiving, gratitude, humility, peace of mind and freedom. Monahan's breadth of vision is not surprising, since she believes that all of us, at some time in our lives, are powerless over something, that alcholism stands for our human condition in its sad, lost and sorry state, and that AA can show us what God has in mind for everyone in community, love, and service. In particular, Monahan uncovers within the Twelve Steps the ancient threefold way of the spiritual life-- purgative, illuminative and unitive. While providing the reader with a better understanding of alcoholism as a threefold disease -- physical, mental and spiritual -- Monahan offers deep insights into the relationship between the 12 step program and one's search for God."
1,"Plastic piece of junk, not worth the price","I bought this item, to hear a Big Island of Hawaii shortwave signalfrom Honolulu at night. A total of 177 miles.The receiver did little else, than rebroadcast every AM station inHonolulu on the Shortwave band, and between those stations, onlyheard florescent lights.Not worth the money...and for sure, I wouldn't depend on it in anemergency.Plastic, poorly built piece of junk, in my humble opinion."
5,First Time User - Awesome Results,"I decided that I was going to make a table for our son's backyard deck, but when it came to the top the plans I had obtained called for drilling and installing dowel pegs. I had never done this. I found this product and purchased. Super quick delivery and great communication. I read and re-read the instruction several times until I was comfortable, laid out my pieces and began. Sure enough, within 30 minutes I was gluing the dowels and my top was secured. Then it was just putty in the seams, sand and it was ready to be stained. I've used my dowel guide and pegs on 3 other projects and have never had an issue."
4,RIP Ollie Nightingale,"Ollie's second Ecko disc is another good'un. Some good up-tempo Southern soul chuggers (""Tell Me What You Want Me To Do"", ""I'm Your Sure Thing Man"") blues (""Down at the Place To Be"") and even a nice ballad in the classic soul style (""If Your Lucky Enough To Have A Good Woman""). Ollie also remakes his classic ""I Got A Sure Thing"". There are a few dud tracks but overall another good cd from the late great Ollie Nightingale and the always reliable Ecko label."
2,What a Snooze!!,"While occasionally this book had its good parts, I generally found that every time I read it I fell asleep. It didn't matter what time: afternoon, night, morning. It was difficult to interpret. Good luck to those attempting to read it!"
5,Must have for serious tequila drinkers,I can't think of one negative. I even have a four pack as backup in case one breaks or others want to sample great tequila at a get together.
2,"Pul-eeze, Mary! ...","This lightweight book offers only the age old stereotypes of gay men as squealing, twittering, sexual prodigies obsessed with body image, clothes, stuffed animals, divas, and bon mots. Judy Garland, Bette Davis, and other stars of the silver screen are cited as gay icons; many homomasculine young men of my acquaintance refreshingly don't know a thing about these dead women. This book is OK for guys who are looking for a chuckle or two at the expense of their own people but for me the entire piece was tiresome and insignificant. Don't embarass yourself by giving this book as a gift to anyone. If you must have a look-see though, check the book out at a public library and save your hard earned dollars."
5,Laughed until I cried,"Oh my gawd! I literally stained the pages with tears of hysterical laughter. I leave it out for people to see, and I've found that many males that swear they have no ""traits"" must hang their heads in admission that they love craft stores and movie musicals."
1,Stereotypes On Parade,I bought this book as a Christmas gift for a friend. I'm glad I looked at it before wrapping it. Not even humorous enough for me to donate to a used book store.Save your money!
1,Disappointed!,"I'm glad I did not pay a lot for this book. I was very disappointed. Gaydar is no joke. It is a serious thing that most gays go through trying to connect with someone who they are not sure is gay, yet not wanting to always be put on the spot or embarrassed by approaching the wrong person. I thought the book would offer tried and true methods, yet what I got was a humorous book."
5,Hilarious,"I found this book to be hilarious, the author is very intuitive to the gay culture. Everything he has mentioned i have done. I will pass it on to my non-gay friends to see how they do. Its a must read."
4,a few years to late!,"Well, let me start off by saying that this book is very informative, however i found myself a lilttle to ""cultured"" for this book. This would have been a great read had i gotten it a few years back, but living life as an openly gay man for the last 3 year, I found this book thought me nothing I already knew! I do however recoment this book to any newby's out there, but do keep in mind that this book is mostly, if not wholly based on steroe types, but unfortuanetely these are stereo type that live up to what most of us are. So read up, enjoy, yet keep an open mind!"
1,Horrible quality. Save your money!,"I purchased 15 of these locks, and every one of them are like toys. They easily bend and I have had to discard some because the locks quit working only after one or two uses."
1,Garbage!,"I have always had a high opinion of Weber grills...and still do. However, their add-ons are a different story. I bought one of these things and it NEVER worked right. The poor sealing of the battery compartment guaranteed that, at best one lamp worked at any one time...and that dimply. The design is such that the heat of the grill WILL mwlt the handle and fog the lenses.Finally, I got fed up and took it off and bashed it against a brick wall. That is all this junk is good for.SHAME ON YOU, WEBER!"
1,CAUTION:does NOT fit this year's models,"very disappointed, and everywhere online I see this light it makes no mention of this: when I received the handle, a sticker had been added to the box stating that it fits genesis grills PRIOR TO 2004 MODELS. I tried it anyway, and it will not fit the genesis silver i just bought. The universal handle they make is clearly not for any weber grill, so i guess we're just out of luck."
1,To Hot To Handle,As a Weber Gas Grill Loyalist I was very excited about this new cooking light and found that it worked well during the first month of use in December 2002. Then at the beginning of February 2003 both lights have begun to melt and the handle is very hot to the touch. I contacted Weber's customer service and they replaced it at no charge. I replaced the old handle and the new handle is just as hot. Weber recommended using a heat protective glove when grabbing the handle. What kind of design improvement is that? Weber usually has great/reliable products; not this one.
2,MELTDOWN,As a Weber Gas Grill Loyalist I was very excited about this new cooking light and found that it worked well during the first month of use in June 2003. Now at the beginning of August 2003 my light has begun to melt and the handle is very hot to the touch. One of the lights will not turn on even with a battery change. I have only had this light for 60 days. Most Weber products last for years. I am currently asking amazon and weber to replace the product. I would also tell people that the light will not fit their Genesis grill as well as the original handle. I hope that my replacement will fit better and hold up under common grilling conditions.BUCKEYE FAN AND GRILLING FANATIC
1,"After grilling with this dim light, then failure, I've replaced it with the Brookstone Grill Light.","Installed this handle light bar on my 10yr old Weber grill about (2) yrs ago. The lights worked for a few months but really did a poor job of illuminating the entire grill area. After about a year, the lights would not turn on. Replace all batteries, bulbs, tightened end caps for battery compartments - nothing worked.Have since installed the Brookstone Grill Light. Great product, clamps onto any handle shape, robust design and construction, and super bright lights. Using it is like grilling in daylight!If you grill year round, do yourself a favor and consider the Brookstone Grill Light."
5,Great Author - Great Book!,"I have joined the throng of devoted fans of this author in general and this series in particular. Those who loved Ellis Peters' Cadfael mysteries, will find some of the same elements present here. Gregory's books are hard to put down and the humorous elements in this particular one had me laughing out loud. The ending was a bit muddled, I felt, and perhaps a bit far-fetched, but the book is well worth the read whether you like the ending or not. I have only recently discovered Gregory's medieval series, but this will not be my last one to read. I intend to read all of this series and then start on her other series'. Don't miss this one! It's a winner!"
2,smaller,"The pendandt, although very beautiful, was smaller than I had expected. The photo made it appear so much larger. But the main issue that I had with the piece, was that the pendant spune too freely. It would never lay flat on either the denim lapis side, or the onyx side. I haven't hardly worn it for that reason."
5,Superb Quality,"I first tasted this at one of the top 4 olive farms in the US, while tasting olive oils. They had this bottle in the back, and told me that they use it sparingly (with ice cream and olive oil of course) but that it was the best they had tasted and was imported from Italy. It was great, so I ordered some on the spot from my phone. I would never normally pay this much for balsamic but it's top shelf and will last a very long time."
1,Love History I and II,But was dissapointed I had already purchased separately and thought this was something elese so now I have two copies of the same videos
5,Good for a first course.,"Schumacker and Lomax make for a good first course in SEM. Although they are somewhat less technical than Bollen (1989), they are a little more up-to-date, and very good reading for a beginning student of SEM. I found the sections on confirmatory factor analysis and identification very useful."
4,well done!,"It is a long time ago I started looking for good textbook that could introduce my students into SEM. After reading many boring titles dealing with SEM I have finally found what I was looking for: A beginner's guide to SEM.First of all, this is didactically very well written book: authors sketch every selected problem quit simply but in the same time absolutely correctly. Then they explain it (without reduntant tiny details) and finally, they provide reader with practical ilustration how to deal with it.Structure of the book is built logically and chapters lead reader gradually and comprehensibly through all main problems of SEM. I really like this book and my students too."
5,A very good book,This is a very good book about SEM for the beginners and advanced. The book gives a clear and concise principles and examples about SEM. This book definitely enables the readers clearly understand the subject.
5,Absolutely fantastic,"This is a fantastic little desktop fan.Besides looking really cool, this little air whiz folds up quite nicely when not in use. The cloth blades are totally harmless, but move a good volume of air - at least as much as the 6"" desktop fan it replaced. The motor is near silent and with no large safety cage or hard blades there's virtually no vibration.Kudos to the engineers that took a change on fabric blades and knocked it out of the park."
1,Worst Fan Ever,"All this stupid thing does is disturb the air -- it generates ZERO breeze, and ZERO relief. My old fan -- which was the same size, and had soft plastic blades you could also stick your fingers in without getting hurt -- was a miracle compared to this turkey. How did this get past even Round 1 of Vornado product review???? It's really unbelievable."
4,Remarkably Powerful Little Fan,"I originally bought this fan so that I wouldn't have to worry about my young son sticking his fingers in it. The fabric blades give nothing more than a slight stinging slap even on high. I have had this fan for 5 years and it run constantly during the summer months. It moves a lot more air than any other fan I've owned of even twice the size! I do admit, I'm on my second one, but the first one broke shortly after I got it, but I dropped it, so that is no fault on the manufacturer!"
5,Great office fan,"This is a great little desk fan for the office or cubicle. As others pointed out, this fan needs to be within about 3 ft to work well. Unlike other fans, however, it is no problem to position it at close range. It has a very small footprint, looks good and, most importantly, is really quiet. On the low setting it is barely noticeable in a quiet office at 2 ft distance, yet moves enough air to make a hot office (mine usually runs in the low 80s) bearable. And it is fairly cheap as well."
5,Breezy!,"This is a great little fan for my cubicle, two speeds make it nice & cool. Doesn't take up much space& fan blades are safe & soft."
5,EXCELLENT!!,"I highly recommend the Zippi. I bought it in green. I was a bit skeptical when I first took it out of the box, because I thought the blades were a foam rubber, but they are like a windbreaker material. It is very powerful and very quiet. Completely in love with it. They only thing that I don't like about it is that the on/off switch is behind the actual fan, but luckily because the blades are cloth it doesn't hurt one bit if you happen to hit them with your hand."
2,Flimsy,"It worked fine for about two weeks then for no reason it stopped working. It makes no noise or anything. When it worked, it barely moved any air. I wish there was a similar size fan that actually works good."
2,"Interesting, but falls short.","This is definitely an interesting read about the various ""dialects"" around America. But, borrow it from you library like I did; don't buy it. There was way too much time spent on Ghetto English and Valley Girl talk. What's missing is the impact of science and technology on shaping the language. There is also not enough emphasis on the ""language that will make one successful"" and I don't mean the overpaid athletes! I mean the everyday average Joe who has pulled himself up by his bootstraps and succeeded.The level of writing in this book disappointed me. A few points left we wondering what the authors truly meant since their sentence structure was so poor. Then, toss in the occasional passive voice and what can I say. Their were several places where section breaks were needed; an indication that the authors had stayed too long on a topic like the Ghetto English."
3,Not much different from Cultures 1,"My wife and I got copies to play cooperatively against the computer. But you cannot share one civilization -- you can only be allied together as different civilizations. And the number of maps and game times is limited for a game of its date.For a game whose multiplayer play is almost identical to Cultures 1, but advertised to have more multiplayer flexibility, we expected more.The singleplayer play is also almost identical to Cultures 1, but with missions broken up into ""city"" parts and ""explore with your hero"" pars."
2,Disappointed,"I was a little disappointed when I received this product. First of all, by the description, it seemed like the drawers would be big enough to store 12"" x 12"" scrapbook paper but it is not. The actual drawers only measure 10"" x 13 1/4"" so I am a little disappointed about that but I figured I could find other things to store in it so I put it together anyway and when I did, it does not stand level and rocks back and forth. For the price, I am very disappointed. The drawer knobs are nice though.The other issue I have come across since I've owned this (well over a year) the drawers do not fit properly on the little rails they are meant to. They fall off easily and you have to really concentrate on pushing them in just so. Definitely not for kids to use or you will have a mess. . . I also noticed that they added the drawer dimensions. . . yippeee for them, maybe they actually do read feedback!"
2,you fooled me amazon....,i was really fooled by this product. it looks like the frame is metal but turns out it's cheap plastic. the drawers don't stay on the track when you pull them out. it's wayyyyyyyyy over priced. i wish i knew hot to return it. don't be fooled by the imatation metal look. i'm surprised at amazon for selling such an inferior product at an inflated prices. Shame on You! i will think twice before i rely on Amazon for good quality products. they seem to be a web purchase portal for anyone who's willing to pay to be on their site.
4,i love it but....,i like this alot but the only problem is that you can't put alot of stuff in draws or else it will come off the tracki use this for my make up and accessories and its perfect! it holds alot of my stuff and doesn't take up too much space in my small room
3,Not very sturdy,Bins do not competely reach each side of unit so they fall off of their tracks alot. Look elsewhere for a better cart.
3,Its roomy but....,"I love the colors and it gives you plenty of room. However, if you put heavier stuff in the drawers they tend to fall out of the slots. I do have one drawer that no matter what i put in it, it will not stay on the track. It tends to be wobbly too. If you are using it for light storage its fine. However, i bought it to store my makeup in and the drawers arent durable enough for some of my palettes and powder compacts."
1,Useless for anything heavier than cotton balls,"It may look good but it is worthless. This was advertized as a scrapbook paper holder but is a total FAIL. There's no way could they hold a stack of any paper like their ad showed.The metal frame is so flimsy that the drawers slide off their tracks uder the slightest weight. The drawers themselves are very, very flimsy plastic and deform easily. Their edges - the parts that are supposed to keep them in their tracks - are no stronger than the drawers; it's a recipe for disaster. If one drawer slips off the track, it shifts its weight to the next drawer, then the next. Soon the entire thing and its contents are in a heap on the floor.Maybe one pair of scissors or some tape and a glue stick... definitely nothing heavier than 5 ounces per drawer. Don't waste your money."
1,terrible drawers,"Drawers always fall out of their grooves and end up knocking down the next few drawers below as well. The drawers were too heavy for the kids to easily carry, and they would spill all the supplies out or bump all the other drawers down off their runners. I had this in my daycare and hated it."
5,Great organizer!,I ordered this for my classroom to organize my materials for two weeks at a time. It works perfect! It was very easy to put together. I was done in 15 minutes.
2,Poor Drawer Design/Quality,I have 2 of these and they are a fabulous idea and perfect for my needs but I am frustrated with the drawers now bowing with just a little weight in them. I've had them just a few months and they were great in the beginning but now they hang and fall off the rails when you pull them out because the plastic is not sturdy enough to hold less than 1-1/2 pound of materials! The size would indicate you could fill it with paper but trust me... 1/2 full is still TOO FULL and it bowes the sides of the flimsy plastic drawers. Typical great idea but just a little better quality would make them actually a great product too!
2,Not Happy with this Item,"I was hoping this product would have been designed alittle better. I love it for the storage and organization it gives, however the drawers don't seem to stay on the tracks. Every time you pull out a drawer, it falls off the track. Even the slightest movement with the product takes the drawers of its tracks. I would have expected a better product for the money I spent!StacyIndianapolis, In"
4,Good organizer,"Construction is good, the parts all fit together well. We use it for lightweight craft items and it works very well. I'd recommend it to anyone wanting to organize small lightweight items."
2,Not Sure What to Say,"The cart looks great, however, I have since found the same at Joanne's Fab for $10 less. The drawers fall off track every time I pull them out; the frame is too wide for the drawers. One drawer has already broken on the side, leaving a hole approimately 3"" around. Perhaps, if you use for only the lightest weight items, it might work fine. I don't think the items I put in the drawers are heavy. But like I said, it looks great!!!"
2,Cheap Plastic,"I was looking for a metal cart, which is why I purchased this item. The ""Smoke"" drawers are made of cheap warbled plastic, so I returned the item."
4,Great Storage,"This ten drawer storage cabinet is great for storing small items, like tubes of beads and also strings of beads. Will work for any item that fits in its drawers. The only draw back to this system is that if anything heavy is put in them the drawers will come off the track."
4,"Somewhat crooked, but works great.","I love the multi-colored drawers. The cart is light weight and easy to move. It was easy to put together and will help me sort through the paper clutter. The frame was a little crooked after I put it together, but it still does the job. Great buy on Amazon. It is more expensive everywhere else."
4,"Beautiful, not too expensive.","Very sturdy and very beautiful drawer that fits nicely next to my desk. The only problem is that the drawers sometimes fall off their rails when you pull them out. It's easy to slip them back on though. I believe it would be considerably more expensive if the drawers had actual rails so it's fine for a simple college student like me and it really does look nice. Could be cheaper but overall, I'm very happy."
1,Poor construction,"I thought this would be cute in my sewing room without taking up much space. The drawers do NOT stay in the racks and don't slide easily. Its a battle every time I retrieve something. The drawers are shallow and don't hold much. Don't be fooled by the pretty colors and cheap price. Save yourself the aggravation and assembly time and buy stackables bins from a container store. You spend more, but they're more durable, hold much more, and they come in pretty colors too."
2,Don't Buy one,"The drawers do not fit in the tracks or they come off the tracks. A great idea but so poorly made that the frustration of using it is > handiness.I would not buy one again. My husband has fixed it once. His fix allowed a couple more drawers to work. However, it can not be adjusted any further.Don't buy one - its junk"
3,"Nice in concept, but lacking in reality","I have two sets of these drawers (one just like this one and the other with more drawers). I really do like these drawers, but I must admit that they do have problems. They continually get off track. I even returned my first set, thinking they were not aligned correctly (manufacturing defect). Well, that wasn't the case; the next set was just as bad. I homeschool and love being able to divide out my children's papers/assignments/workbooks/supplies into the various colorful drawers. I don't, however, like seeing all the plastic shavings from having opened and closed the drawers. The plastic of the drawers moving across the frame of the set produces a sandpaper like affect. Thus, I have to periodically clean the frame and the floor underneath. As you can see: I like them and I don't like them."
5,Rolling Lego Holder,"Our daughter selected this cart to organize the legos for her 2 boys ages 3 and 6. When they took the big wrap off at Christmas, she had already loaded up the drawers with doors etc in one, people in another, different sizes in another and colors in another. During our I-chat, I saw the boys just grab the cart and roll it into another room so they could build something. It was easy for them to manage and they can move their legos anywhere very easily without help from their Mom. They can also clean up in an organized way so the next time they use their legos, they can find the pieces they want to make their creations. Our daughter lives in a very small home so this is excellent for them since sometimes building legos is OK in one room and on another day another room is better."
1,Dave Liebman fans beware,"If you're thinking of purchasing this cd because you were curious about how Dave Liebman accompanies singers, DON'T DO IT. Liebman's solo statements are brief and his hard, Coltranesque tone and his characteristic embellishments and grace notes aren't a good match for Abby Lincoln's vocal style. Liebman has never had very good luck with singers in general. Surprisingly, Liebman's style seems to be appropriate for 60s style R&B, as you can tell if you happen to be lucky enough to own a vinyl copy of ""Light'n Up Please!"" which features Pee Wee Ellis of James Brown's band, bassists Jeff Berlin and Tony Saunders, and Richie Beirach on piano, among many others. The vocals are kind of crappy on that lp too, but at least Liebman's solo style makes sense in that context."
3,Disappointing,"The book's description is sort of accurate: it contains snippets and stories and memoirs from people who grew up during the Depression (nearly all of them in Wisconsin). There are economical recipes and interesting old flavors and techniques.What the description DOESN'T say is that this is a church bazaar-type cookbook, typed on a manual typewriter or perhaps an old dot matrix printer, then reproduced and spiral bound. There are far too many typos and even some repeated stories. Badly edited and badly assembled and not worth the price.If the Lutheran church ladies sold me this, and tacked on a little extra $$ to refurbish the church, I'd have happily paid this price. But not otherwise."
3,Nice stories and interesting recipes,"I like the book. I was a little surprised to see that most of the stories and recipes were from ice cold Wisconsin, Minnesota, etc states. I wish it had represented all the states and climates of the era. It's a good reminder that hard times can come at any time and being prepared and resourceful is a skill. I love the sharing and helping attitude of the people turning to each other in a time of crisis."
5,An invaluable collection !,"What's so wonderful about this collection is that it's in black and white. So many of us have heard our parents and grandparents tell the woeful tales of having to make do with precious little, but here, the stories have been preserved. There's a lot that can be learned from these stories, not the least of which is how spoiled a society we've become. Hard times can bring the best out of people. I applaud the author for collecting the stories and recipes, and giving us a startling look at desperate times.--Jane E. Garrett, author of ""The Market Basket: Cooking and Eating in Lawrence, Kansas, 1921-1949"""
1,Wrong description same part number,"The item delivered was a four port hub, not a five port hub as advertised. It has the same part number as the item pictured, but is a different item. I will return it."
5,Steiger does it again!,"Steigers books are often not the most difficult reads, but are written in a delightful manner that leaves the reader wanting more.This book is no exception. I have had it now for years, and it has been read and reread several times. Each time I seem to get something else out of it. You will look at animals differently after reading this book, and you will start to see meaningful messages in innocuous events. Steiger has a winning book here, that will resonate with you. You will not be disappointed."
3,Lost totem,"This book was very heard to get into. There was a lot of good information, but it took me a while to get through it."
2,It's a great book if you like beans!!!,"If you are looking for a low fat cookbook with some meat in it, this is not it. Although I tryed some of the recipes, they are good, but boring. One can only eat so many beans."
5,7th Heaven Scrap book,"This is a great 7th Heaven scrap By Cathy East Dubowski.This book including alot of pictures and a recap of every show through 1-4. There are bios on the actors/actresses Barry Watson, Jessica Biel, Beverley Mitchell, David Gallagher, Machenzie Rosman, Stephen Collins, Catherine Hicks I would really recomend this book to any 7th Heaven fan!"
4,Great decanter for a great price.,"I bought this decanter for my dad for his birthday. You automatically expect quality since this is Riedel, but until you see this in person you just can't describe how elegant it is. The description says that it will hold 2 bottles of wine, but my suggestion is to buy it to hold one bottle, which gives the wine plenty of room to breathe. Definitely a great gift, looks much more expensive than it actually is, quite a good buy."
4,"Holds alot, but maybe too big.","I have the smallest version of this decanter, which holds one bottle of wine up to the very top. Maybe a size in the middle would be best, but do love Riedel products."
4,does the job,"This is DEFINITELY the right size for a single 750ml bottle. I have no idea what Riedel is thinking saying that it is for a magnum...while indeed it will ""hold"" a full magnum, it would be full up to the neck, which is not really the right idea for a decanter.The glass is a bit thinner than I expected, but it is very high quality, consistent and nice looking, with no flaws at all.I do believe this is great value for money."
5,sturdy little bucket,"I have used these buckets around my horse farm for years and I can't get enough of them! Occasionally one will get destroyed by a horse, but normally they last a very long time. I color-code what I use them for, for convenience, for instance, a particular feed mix for a particular horse, so the wide color selection is a PLUS."
1,Keep Your Money!,"I thought it was no different than the cases shown on TV, I was disappointed. If I had my time back, I wouldn't buy it."
1,Disappointed,"For some reason, I thought this would be a compilation of some of the funniest moments from Judge Judy's shows. I was looking forward to lots of laughs and it's just not that type of video. In fact, I thought it was pretty boring. I would like to see memorable moments of some of the funny plaintiffs and defendants. Not at all what I thought it would be."
4,Judge Judy,"I love Judge Judy tv show and her dvd is even better than her tv show, thier is no commercials just Judge Judy."
1,Never Received,I was very disappointed. Not only was it not shipped when promised but I have yet to receive it.
4,good dvd,If you are a Judge Judy fan you will enjoy this DVD. My favorite part is the Judyisms like ummm is not a word.
5,Criminal Justice,Judge Judy: Justice ServedShe's has a great way for bringing out the truth inpeople. It's a good program for people who like watchingcourt shows.Linda McCollum
4,Finally a Judge Judy DVD!,This DVD has 9 cases plus extras. You get to see the episodes without the commercial breaks and the closing statements are different. Judge Judy says a little something before each episode. I am a huge fan and these 9 cases are not really the ones I would pick. The only exception is the lawyer/paralegal case which is one of my favorites. Not sure why the other cases were selected. The quality of the DVD is much better then watching the original episodes. The extras are nice too. This is a good start of what I hope is a regular DVD release. Why not have each season released in a box set?
3,"""If something doesn't make sense, it's not true""","I wish I could say this Judge Judy catchphrase was true about the recent reviews, but I having a hard time finishing watching this DVD. I was expecting some really off the wall court cases that would keep me laughing,but the first three I've watched are very basic cases you could see on the tv for free any day of the week. The tupperware case was odd, but still not worthy of posting on a pay per view DVD. I say keep your money can just fire up your DVR for the weekday airings."
3,"Judge Judy is Great, sadly, this DVD is not so great","I'm an avid Judge Judy fan and was thrilled when I leared of this DVD. I was expecting the cases where the litigants caused a scene, were caught in out and out lies and generally outrageous. The cases on this DVD were not any of those. I was a bit bored and disappointed.I enjoyed the 60 minutes interviews and definitely enjoyed listening to the cases in the background while I puttered around the house, but was hoping for more."
2,Not worth it,"I was excited to see this DVD in Canadian stores shortly after it was announced in the US. After watching the entire DVD, I was very disappointed. It contains cases that were nothing special that seemed randomly selected from mid-series seasons and a two interviews from 60 Minutes. I was surprised with the amount of cases shown for a show thats been on for eleven years. You'd think they could find more interesting cases over 11 years than the few they featured. This is definitely not worth it's price."
5,Gifting with Judge Judy,"This is simple. While I enjoy watching Judge Judy, I have a friend who follows every episode and records and can watch 10 shows in one evening. I haven't had a chance to see this purchase of Judge Judy Justice Served but I didn't get it for myself. It was a perfect gift for someone who really enjoys the show and it made them very excited and happy to receive this DVD. What could be better or simpler?!"
4,SHE'S THE GREATEST,JUDGE JUDY SAYS ALL THE THINGS I WISH I HAD THENERVE TO SAY. SHE SHOOTS FROM THE HIP.
1,Judge Judy,I am a fan of Judge Judy and thought this would make a great Christmas present for my husband. We (4 of us) viewed it this past Christmas and all of us were disappointed because the shows they chose to include were not her most memorable shows by any means.
2,Simply not worth the price.,"I'm a huge fan of Judge Judy, I've watched hundreds of episodes over the last ten years. I guess that's obvious though, why else would I have purchased this DVD?Well, the DVD is disappointing. It only has 9 cases, none of which are particularly long or much more interesting than the show itself. It has a couple 60 minutes interviews that are cool, just because it was neat to see Judge Judy in her former ""life"" so-to-speak and with her family. But, all said and done, this DVD isn't even worth the $12 asking price.If I buy a DVD of a show like this, I expect to at least be given more than an hours worth of cases and some slapped-together ""extra"" content. I would not recommend purchasing this DVD as you are better off just watching the show."
3,"Loved the Content, but Not Enough!","I work days and don't have cable/satellite television so I very rarely, if ever, get to see a full episode of Judge Judy. When I saw the DVD I snapped it up, and I loved it, except there are only 9 episodes on it! I would like to see the entire series, season by season, available on DVD...I can guarantee you I would buy it and I know there are many fans who would do so as well.Hopefully, this one was to ""test the waters,"" and there will be enough sales to release more (ALL) shows on DVD...so great to be able to watch them for someone who can't see them daily, and for those fans who would love a Judge-Judy-thon...episode after episode with no commercials.I also love Judge Judy's comments before each episode."
3,Not what I expected,"Judge Judy: Justice ServedI simply thought the video would be more entertaining then the t.v. show especially since you cantfind it in the stores like ie.""Jerry Springer uncut"". It was ok just oething that I could have saved my money on especially since i saw every episode that is on this DVD. However if you're a die hard fan then I suggest you buy it! Deilvery was excellentand on time."
4,"Yay, a cheap collection!","Deathnote is one of my top 5 animes. This collection of the live action movies (which I LOVED) is a great deal! The quality is excellent, as it should be with blu-ray, but theres not many extra features to push this above and beyond to 5 stars.If you don't like anime or you've never watched Deathnote, this is definitely worth watching. I admit that some of the acting - mostly only in the beginning - is a little much and hard to get over, but the core story here is really superb. For the more narrow-minded, I'd wait until the american remake - which is inevitable; there is a lot of culture ingrained in this movie, and its best to wait for it to be americanized to catch the awesome story.*In summary, if you're a fan, this is a must-buy."
4,death note bluray collection,"all i have to say is the anime series is always better. no one to this date has yet to make a movie based off an anime better than the anime itself. oh yeah, amazon is awesome!!"
3,Good 2nd hand system ONLY,"I purchased one of these factory refurbished in the fall of 2002 for $650. It replaced my HP I had since early 2000. Moving up from a 533 celeron to this speed demon was amazing! Unfortunately, longevity wasn`t this models strong point. After less than 2 years the 60G Maxtor hard drive gave up the ghost. In the fall of 2005 the motherboard went and it made it`s final resting place in the junk heap. The computer was never altered or gamed with, only used for light computing. If you can find one for less than $100 it might be worth looking into."
5,nails of poor quality,"looks good and is cheap, but the nails literally broke trying to use them, possibly my fault but i had to buy new nails from home depot, after that all is fine."
2,I'm on my second one...,"I bought two, thinking I might use another one elsewhere, but I ended up using the second after the first locking mechanism fell apart; the key pulled the entire lock out. The screws that come with the lock strip easily, so make sure you drill a good pilot hole first, and tighten by hand."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS,piece of ------ did not lock had to rig it and my demented husband could still get in through the door!!!!
3,Still having problem with this lock,The screws are not in the right places. This is why we are having a problem and they keep coming out of the wall.
1,Worst piece of garbage,"This security lock (National Hardware V806 Keyed Chain Door Lock, Brass) was broken before it arrived. The key was impossible to turn and I could pull out the security chain with mild pressure. It would have cost me more to return it than I paid for it so I just threw it away. Maybe something ""Made In USA"" next time..............."
4,"Jury is still out on these, but customer service was fantastic!","I was having some problems with dead spots on my bass when playing. To rule out the strings being a problem, I put these on and loved the sound, but it didn't help my problem. I had them on for about a month and then took my bass to the shop for adjustments. He fixed my issues, but the tech noticed some corrosion on the 3rd string. It still played ok, but I noticed that the 1st string sounded pretty lifeless. I emailed D'Addario about this and two days later a new set of strings appeared on my doorstep. I haven't had an opportunity to put these new strings on yet to see how these perform, but I gave them four stars based on the customer service."
1,Yuck,"Hated these the moment I got the first string on. I stopped at the second and ordered something with which I was already familiar. Tension on these was higher than I care for and the smoothness of playability is less than on the rounds I normally use. A nice experiment, but I won't be using these ever again."
2,Toshiba refuses to replace defective products,"Bought the M205 in January 2004. Took it in for repair a couple weeks later because microphone (too close to speaker) was causing feedback through the speaker (ear-piercing shriek). Toshiba authorized service rep. was unable to repair it (after ordering and installing a back-ordered part from Toshiba, about 4 weeks of effort on my part). Now Toshiba says a ""Toshiba Engineer"" must have a crack at it. Getting this thing repaired could become a part-time job. Perhaps if you're fortunate enough to purchase an M205 that does not have this problem you'll be happy, but if you ever have a problem, be prepared for a real struggle....."
4,Missing Link,"Too many anthologies these days focus on short stories, with fewer and fewer outlets for longer pieces. Not anymore. Imaginings is a fine new anthology of longer short fiction.Standout stories include ""Walking Contradiction"" by Nancy Jane Moore. In a world where, several generations previously, scientists created a new gender with both male and female sex organs and reproductive systems (called ambigendered and able to become pregnant and impregnate others), an ambigendered detective is hired to find a young man allegedly taken in by a cult that removes the genitalia of its members. And the detective's estranged offspring is coming to visit. The story explores racism, gender, mother-father-hood, focusing on what it means to be human. Dan Pearlman's ""Great White Hope"" concerns and ill-fated trip to Mexico for a young married couple and a mirror. Is aging boxer Frank Moran a con artist? Or shaman? Sometimes it's hard to tell."
3,Squeaky,"It has all the features I wanted, but for some reason the hinges near the face SQUEAK constantly, whenever I move my wrist. I had the same model before, that I bought at a department store, and it never did that. Perhaps this one needs E-40 or some lubricant, but it almost makes me think this was made cheaply."
4,simply perfect for small/tiny wrists ONLY,"I've been looking for a waterproof durable watch to wear in clinic and found this. I could tell by the photo that it is a small watch and it definitely is. I have a very small wrist so many watches don't look good on me because the face takes up most of my wrist. This one fits perfectly. I also like that it is simple-doesn't have all of the garb that a lot of watches have that I'm not a fan of. Do wish it had a date on it though. My only complaint is that when I took it out of the package my first impression is that it looks cheap and flimsy, almost wondered if it was counterfeit because of how cheap it looks, but once I got it on it looks much better. Fingers crossed that it holds up but from reviews it sounds like it does."
1,Not an adult watch-- beware!,"This watch is for a child not an adult -- it looks like a mini-me version of a swatch. I returned it immediately upon receipt and was really bummed because I love swatch. I could barely close the strap on the first hole. Unless you're buying this for a 10 or 11 year old girl at most, don't get this!"
1,HORRIBLE!,"Honestly, unless you're a total cheapskate (like I obviously am), don't even think about buying this. It doesn't work. I've been working with electronic equipment of all sorts since 1981, and I can't get this junk to work. Then, I e-mailed customer service at Scosche and they never fixed or replaced or did anything other than e-mail me back a few times with lame suggestions like, ""make sure the video is set to 'on' "" or ""what kind of ipod do you have""--like I can't read the product description. This is horrible junk. Spend the extra 15 bucks and get the real deal from apple."
1,Judge not by the cover,"The photo shows a bathroom shelf, which is what I really wanted for my two bathrooms... What I got was this two big rubber wheels...Decypher the title, it's a ""3 inch disc wheel""! Not was what the photo shows..."
4,Belgian singer has unique sound,"I first learned of Axelle Red while studying in France in early 1999. I heard her singles ""Ce matin"" (from this CD) and ""Sensualité"" (from ""Sans plus attendre""). I liked both songs immediately and searched them out at the music store. I bought one CD there then the other (to my pleasant surprise) was available on Amazon.com where I purchased it.All of the songs on this are good. ""Faire des mamours,"" ""Mon futur proche,"" ""Stay or not."" I can't help but like the single ""Ce matin."" And the groove on ""Bimbo à moi"" reminds me of fun 60's music.In short...buy this."
5,It's another great Cd from Axelle Red.,"If anyone tries to tell you that this is as good as the other two, don't listen. It's still great music. My personal favourite is ""J'ai jamais dit (je serais ton amie)."" If you understand the beautiful lyrics all the better, but if not, the music and AR's voice make up for that entirely."
3,"Like an extension of ""A Tatons""; So-so","If you were hoping (like me) that AR would get back to the catchy, melodic pop/rock of ""Sans Plus Attendre,"" after the somewhat bland ""A Tatons,"" you'll be disappointed with this one. Like ""A Tatons,"" it has its moments, but as a whole it lacks memorable songs and never seems to take off. My faves are ""A 82 Ans,"" with its unusual electronic bells, and the following ""La Reponse,"" which has a great bluesy groove. For most of this disc her voice is almost a whisper, which is too bad, because when she belts it out, the result is spectacular.~~~Maybe next time..."
2,This book sinks!,"This is a title that could've and should've been a major delight for readers. It should have contained all sorts of items connected with the canal---copies of old engravings, bills of lading, average citizen letters, cartoons and engineering drawings, a review of the source of canal workers, how land sales were stimulated and other economic impacts, an image of the state bond that funded it, a look at political impacts, business news/businesses that used it, a usable distance chart, an idea of how its active life came to an end, etc. This could have been an appealing potpourri, but it doesn't even contain the words to that song about the Erie Canal.Instead, it's just a few items judged to have high literary merit and is only about 176 pages long. This is a disappointment; the author had a subject and title that could have been built into something much more substantial and valuable. I feel Syracuse University Press should give me a refund."
4,"Very good for simple, basic information","I think that the biggest problem with this book is its title: the title is somewhat all-encompassing, while the book itself is very basic. I, too, like my fellow-reviewer in Ohio, tried in vain to find Paradox 8 books in the conventional bookstores. If Paradox is what you have, and your knowledge of database management is limited, this will get you going. If you need/want/require information on using Paradox beyond the absolute bare fundamentals, this is not the book for you. (In fact, I wonder if there is one at all.) This is pretty much the book I needed for my purposes (yes, more practice exercises, and more-complicated practice exercises would be nice), and this has been a very helpful purchase for me!"
1,Likely based on a similar work for Access,"Corel Paradox 8 for Windows by Rick Sullivan (Copyright 1999) is likely based on a similar computer training manual for Microsoft's Access for Windows product. On page 16 the author states ""Access displays the name.."" when I am certain he should have said ""Paradox displays the name.."" The work was probably prepared grudgingly owing to market demand. Instead of saying ""One of the most powerful features of Paradox.."" he says on page 110 ""One of the most powerful features in a database program like Paradox.."". The book ignores concepts like aliases, event and data models, referential integrity, and OPAL which are important for Paradox but not for Access. I suppose the work may have value in hands on training because it comes with exercises and a disk. However, a more inspiring presentation is necessary."
1,For ABSOLUTE - ABSOLUTE - Beginners,"If you do not know how to start yur computer, if you do not know how to start an application - any application, if you cannot even get through the tutorials that come with Paradox - perhaps this is for you. This book is basic - very basic. So basic that it makes the tutorials seem advanced. As has been commented by other reviewers, there is real need for Paradox books that go beyond the beginners tutorials - this is not one of them. I would have given this zero stars, but one star is the default. I have purchased thousands of pages of computer books in recent years. This was the worst I have come across. I write my first review out of horror that someone presented this book as useful. ""It aint"""
1,A Noble and Courageous Attempt,"My search for any books about Paradox 8 at big name bookstores and computer stores was unsuccessful. It is a sad state of affairs for Corel. The fact that Mr Sullivan's book's sales rank is 2200 something compared to Access 97 Bible's rank of 257 portends a sad future for this software suite. And, a sad future is what this sad software suite deserves. Trying to work with Paradox is an exercise in futility. Regrettably, Mr. Sullivan's noble and courageous attempt to tackle this topic is itself an exercise in futility. He is not to be faulted, though, considering what he had to work with. He deserves the Congressional Medal of Honor for a valiant fight."
1,this card doesn't work with iPod and Thinkpad,"Reasons that this card only deserves one star:1) The manual is only a small piece of paper with Mac instrution on one side and PC instructions on the other side. I think [amount]price should at least buy a piece of 8.5x11 letter paper.2) No 1-800 tech support. I have to call long distance for some stupid questions.3) This firewire card for notebook is not powered. So if your firewire device needs power, then by their great tech support guy, you have to buy a [amount] Orange Micro power supply cable, exclusively from their own website. Why don't they tell me this before?4) This card couldn't connect Apple iPod to Thinkpad T23."
3,Very bright sound,"Where ever you install these do not point them right at you. Too much ""SSSSSSS"" sounds for my liking. I have 3000w subwoofer in a Jeep Wrangler so, I considered these for more highs. Didn't really need them but, thought I wouldn't hurt. I took them out after 5 days. Too bright and didn't blend in enough. The sound stood out too much to be on my dash. Maybe an SUV where the speakers are in the doors blasting you in the legs, you might want these but, otherwise just upgrade you component speakers and see if that helps. After I upgraded from pre-existing stock speakers I have PLENTY of highs and don't need these. At least they were cheap to experiment with."
2,not what I was expecting,"better then none I guess! Use these only if ur looking for a little extra high,loud sound...not for high,crisp sound"
2,Get what you pay for,"The speaker seemed to be such a good deal that I couldn't pass them up going by the reviews . after only being installed in my suburban for less than two weeks the speakers are already blown and the initial sound quality before that's was not good . Save your money and find a better brand Sony,Pioneer, kenwood only like 20 dollars more."
5,great,"Hey, today I setup my new onkio receiver with a panasonic surround sound audio sistem for my home teather, so, I bought this tweeters a few months agoand while I was doing my set up I so them there still in the pakage, I bought them back then because of the low price, so I just wanted to try them and install themtogether with the front speakers and wow, what a change they did, everything the music, movies and games sound a lot better, the whole sistem sounds great with them.so please give them a try, you will see."
1,no rate,"very desapointed, one of the tweeters it doesn't work, and after intalled l decided not to remove it, it came propertly packaged is just that one of the 2 tweeters didn't work"
3,"yeah too loud, but....",its sure give loud for this little thing but i want good sounding tweeter not just loud... i want my music loud on my car but this tweeter over power the speakers and it not good to my ears... well for the price don't expect it sound like the $45 dollars pioneer tweeters..
3,"Loud but, but it lacks sound definition","They are loud I agree if you have other speakers which you should to add tweeters it does add that crisp sound but if you turn it too loud it catches the letter ""S"" and amplifies it to the extreme when volume levels are high. If you are hearing a talk show or just a song the trebble must be turned down. Unless you like high pitch sounds with out proper sound definition. Hope it helps. I recommend spend a little more and you will get more."
5,sounds very good,"even though they are cheap the quality isnt. these tweeters sound so good and they are not hooked to an amp. i heard that you shouldnt hook them to an amp, which i agree because they sound so good without them. i definitely would recommend them to any one that want high sound for a cheap price."
4,power handling is overrated!,THE GOOD - these tweeters are highly sensitive and loud. They sound good and are very high pitched. They are sold for a great low price. I bought a second set to use in my home audio and they're amazingTHE BAD - these tweeters are highly overrated in power handling. I hooked the tweeters to a little alpine amp. It gave about 30 rms to each. They lasted only 10 min then decreased in sensitivity by about half and started smoking. After another 5 min they completely died out. The inside melted so bad and became deformed. they were burning hot. THESE TWEETERS ARE NOT MEANT TO BE USED WITH AMPS.
4,Great for the price,These tweets are great. can completly hear the difference in the the music. brings out the voice symbols and snare. it help balance the bass from my 12 inch subs great buy. the only thing i wish it came with is more wire for better postioning.
1,HOLD ON! Information INSIDE the package might sway your decision!,"What a deal, I thought! Got these for $11 and opened the package up, found the instructions on how to wire them in, and STOP! ""For HIGH-POWER SYSTEM APPLICATIONS: 60 watts - 100 watts (RMS) please use the resistor 16 ohm / 20 watt outline (sic) in figure B (RESISTOR NOT INCLUDED)"" !! Now, many of today's systems are easily 60+ watts, so you NEED this resistor so you don't fry the tweeters right off. Note that it will require TWO of these resistors. Now go and try and FIND a 20 WATT 16 ohm resistor! 16 ohm, NO problem...but 20 WATTS? Amazon doesn't have them, several other sites didn't have them, and judging from the price of the 10 WATT resistor I found (the highest I could find) you're probably looking at $5-10 PER RESISTOR, IF you can find them! So, this is NO GREAT DEAL....for $11 you can take your chances but I don't want to keep swapping out tweeters everytime I crank it up. Now, to find a reputable brand of tweeters......"
1,"Too high, doesn't have any definition. Good Luck Adjusting them","I don't have any experience with sound systems other than my Saturn l100. I have a aftermarket HUD, so I can adjust the equalizer all I want but couldn't get the high high high high (did I say high?) Treble out of the speakers.Product Review:Pros- Could be good if adjusted, maybe with a electric channel governor. Didn't come with one though.I wasn't able too adjust to sound good and I had a 7 channel equalizer.Cheap, like really cheapCons- NO MIDS! Nothing but the highest of the highs for these pieces.My stock sound better.One of the few buys I made on amazon that I regret. Nuff said."
5,These Tweets Enhanced my System by i would say at least 3 times as good,I have a 01 civic Coupe with all around Memphis audio street reference. and a dual coil sub woofer not for BOOM! BOOM! but turned down to be clear and clean. but anyway most of the music was like at my waste in the car and i had to turn it up pretty loud to here it like i like it. but these speakers raised the music to where my head is now there mounted in both pillars and they are amazing. it is so much clearer i ordered more for the rear.
4,a must have,"all i can say is go get it. Power Acoustik NB-2 200-Watt 3 -way Tweeters, everyone gots to have it"
4,work well,"tweeters work wll in my dodge durango,had to replace blown out speaker,only issue is that the soud is very overpowering even when i use change in bass and lower tweeter tey seem to be to loud,work well and am goin to change bass speakers to see if that helps sound !!"
2,Price says it all....,"These set of tweeters are fine. The only reason i gave it a 2 star instead of a 5 is because, one of the tweeters blew out in just a matter of minutes. It was not turn up high, and the song did not even have much highs to begin with. Had the tweeter not gave i would have recommended this set to anyone in need of some crisp highs...."
1,Horrible,"Horrible sounding tweeters, No distinctive sound, Just all muffled and distorted, sounds like someone singing with a towel over there face, Not worth the 11 dollars"
2,not three way,Not a three way speaker and not even close to 200 watts more like 50 or 75 you get what you pay for know amp needed
4,Very Good tweeters,"Those are very good tweeters and very cheap , I came from installing the right now and I really appreciate the choice I've made"
4,More wire please,The tweeters work great and are what I expected. Have not been in to car audio for about 15 years. My only complaint is that they could have supplied more wire with the tweeters. I had to make a joint in my door and I do not like making joints in the middle of the door panel. I installed them 5 inches about my door handle and they do not disappoint.
4,Installed rather easy!!,"This product came in a timely manner and when i got it i instantly went to installing. I have it ran, by attaching it to my front speakers, and i gotta say it is more than i expected from these lil dudes. The reason i rated 4/5 is actually because they may actually be too loud toned for me.. But if you are looking for some super highs this is it!! This was my first tweeters ive owned and they sounded great also come with 1 yr warranty :)"
4,Good basic tweeter,"It is a very nice product the twitter fitted very well into my car and the sound that comes out of it is just great.I have not powered it through the amplifier,it is direct from the receiver EQ and it is performing very well.I would recommend it."
3,Not as good as other Pre de Provence Soaps,"The tangerine soap does not seem as rich and creamy as other soaps from this manufacturer. It is still a good soap, but I would rather spend the money on other scents in this brand. The tangerine smell is almost too sweet."
3,this lasko fan have motor odor,this fan have good output but also have odor that you can really smell across the room. Not sure if its the motor when it gets warm or the ionizer is broken. same smell even when ionizer is off.
5,Lasko Fan,"I bought this tower fan because my bedroom stays warmer than the rest of the house and I cannot sleep. It was easy to put together and it works great! I love the ""Ion"" feature and the variety of speeds and rotation. It really made a difference in my electric bill."
1,No longer trust Lasko fans,"This was our second Lasko tower fan. The first one was a bigger one that lasted over 5 years until it started making an unbearably loud noise and my husband threw it away. I bought this smaller one only a year ago and yesterday it stopped working. It continued to oscillate, but gave out no air. To the trash it went after only 12 months. Lasko tower fans are very good looking and I love the remote but nothing will make me buy another Lasko for as long as I live."
5,Great horn! I've been playing it for 8 years!,"I obtained this horn as a gift from my parents when I was a sophomore in high school. This trumpet has a dark, mellow, and deep sound. It is very free blowing and is responsive. Articulation comes out clear in this horn but it is most clear when you use a average depth or shallow mouthpiece.The mouthpiece that comes with is rather deep and does help produce a even more deep and rich sound, but I find articulation with that mouthpiece to be a little muddled.(But that is just me being picky.)I'd recommend this horn to anyone, but I wouldn't recommend taking it out on the field in a marching band for fear that it would get damaged and also because I'd prefer a brighter sound for those kinds of performances. In my opinion, this horn is best for traditional stage concerts and orchestral settings."
4,Love Death Race!,"If you like great B movies, an absurd premise and Jason Statham, this movie is for you. It has ridiculous cars, hot bodies, an absurd story line and is simply all around fun. A great guilty pleasure!"
4,Death Race...An Interesting Movie! :o),"This was an interesting concept for a movie. I love Jason Statham and had no idea what this movie was about but since it had him, I had to watch it! Have to say, I was thoroughly surprised at how good the movie was considering all the people that die in the process. Would definitely recommend this film! :o))"
3,Intense,The only reason I watched this movie was because of Jason Statham!! It had a bit of a Mad Max feeling. Over all I liked it. I like anything Jason is in!!!
5,"Action from start to finish, loved it","I wish this movie was longer, it goes fast with all the action. The storyline is somewhat predictable but has great action and intensity. The blu-ray quality video and audio is exceptional. Good LFE and surrounds are used throughout. The making of extra is in HD as well."
3,all action no plot,Death race is the true definition of an action flick. From beginning to end there is action in almost every scene. Which make the movie very entertaining. The down side is the plot/story is very weak and at time predictable. also Tyrese is a horrible actor in almost every movie I have seen him in and this one is no different. Everyone else in the movie just gave an average level of acting. All in all the movie gets 3 stars strictly for the action/entertainment factor. Don't look for much more beyond that.
3,"Not bad, but nowhere as good as the original Death Race 2000","This loose remake to the original Death Race is an over the top, big budget film that works to a certain extent. The film has a lot of good elements that work for a Paul Anderson movie; the cinematography, the action scenes, and even some of the story is plausible.So what is wrong with Death Race? Simple the plot is too simplified; its just cars blowing up, extreme gunfire, and stylized action sequences. The movie doesn't have the soul of the original death race. While the plot is somewhat clever and different...it just doesn't have the humor or the cheesiness of the original. Nevertheless it's still a solid popcorn action flick.MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 OUT OF 5"
4,Good Mindless Fun,The stunts were good....lots of action and interesting background...and even a little humour.Guaranteed not to win an Oscar...but who cares.
3,B-Movie extravaganza,"The Bottom Line:Death Race has almost nothing to do with its predecessor Death Race 2000 and will never be mistaken for a great--or even good--movie, but it's about as good a movie as it could be and, hey, there's a small part in most of us that wants to see people fight battles to the death and if you're not too snobbish to admit that, Death Race will do it for you.2.5/4"
3,Fun and Brain Deadening Action Romp,"Take ""Transformers"" strip it of plot and turn it into a hard R film with a hip hop/rock soundtrack and you have something like ""Death Race."" While not great, and certainly lacking any semblance of brains... this movie is fun and a surefire choice for guys night. I recommend it to the man-movie crowd just for it's sheer macho appeal and some killer wipeouts."
4,"ACTION, ACTION!","This movie didn't shoot for an oscar nod, it's just a straight up action movie. Jason Statham is doing his usual hard faced, kick butt role, which is what he does best. The race/fight scenes are excellent and I really enjoyed them.The only thing that was kind of off note is the female co-pilots. The explanation for them seemed forced and just didn't jive, but that's the only weak point.So if you want some hardcore action, and a Mad Max style movie this is it!"
1,Garbage Movie,Didn't enjoy this movie. I read lot of positive reviews before I bought this dvd and thought it would be a good film. finally it wasn't that good enough. this is movie with no story at all and its just some 3D made animation and effects. it was like computer game.
1,Death Pace,"Death Race consists of painful and unpleasant sensations, a nauseous movie for kids with a mental age of between - 8 and 12 years, obsessed with stupid video games like Twisted Death Metal and Road Smash. Only a 12 year old boy with an upper limit IQ of 10 could find this offensive, moronic, childish nonsense ""fun.""Death Race had a lot of guns, gun eye candy, gun flames and gun blow up scenes, but nothing else. The writing was dull and the prison aspect took away from the original story. Death Race fails as sci-fi (a future world or society is not explored).Overall this movie just gets boring after watching the same cars drive around in a small circle over and over again with no people dying.I was incredibly let down by this film. This is a phenomenally unintelligent movie."
3,Good Entertainment,The movie is certainly entertaining but it doesn't have the political overtones of the original
3,Price for this,I dont understand the high price of this dvd. Just about all single disc dvds are around $16.99 this hasnt been under $20.00 & is now $26.99. The movie is ok but i would never pay the high price for it im wondering if Universal is trying to make some of the box office total back by asking such a high price.
3,Cars with 'Tude,"What is modern filmmakers' penchant for bleached-out sepia-tinted color that looks like moldy black and white? It does not seduce me. To be frank, it looks just plain ugly. I suppose, in the case of this movie, it signifies the ugliness of the future that awaits us.Despite its ugly-duckling appearance, ""Death Race"" is a serviceable action flick starring the charismatic and appealingly imperturbable Jason Statham (of ""The Bank Job"" fame). Short on plot, ""Death Race"" is long on action, the explosive action of racing between souped-up, armor-plated, rocket-mounted, grotesque-looking vehicles.There's one catch to these races: They're not about winning, they're about killing the other competitors. The more racers that are killed, the higher the ratings of the televised matches. It's an interesting theme, but it seems to lack the necessary acerbic wit to pull it off to complete satisfaction.--Bryan Cassiday, author of ""Fete of Death"""
2,Sticky and skips,"I was very happy with the shipping and handling of this DVD, it was fast and packaged well. However, the DVD must have had something spilled on it because when I took it out of the cover there was a liquid stain and it is really sticky! It skips which I am assuming was caused by the sticky substance. It just makes me wonder if these products are quality checked before they are bought and then sold?"
2,LONG BORING AND DUMB!,"I am a fan of the original film, but this slick looking remake is like a bad video game. It's long, not much fun and I found myself wondering why I was wasting my time. Even for a no brain action film, this one doesn't cut it! Watch the original and leave this one in the scrap heap! The DVD transfer look very good."
3,Dread Central review!,"In the end Death Race is a goofy little movie. If I were thirteen years old with the attention span of a tick, this would probably be my idea of a cool exploitation flick...Read the whole review on DreadCentral.com!Death Race [Blu-ray]"
2,Scared me silly!!!!!!!!!,"I love a scary movie. A friend told me about this movie so I ordered it. My husband had gone to bed so I snuggled up on the couch all alone. Big mistake!! This movie scared the beegeebers out of me. I watched the whole movie with my hand over my mouth so I would not scream out loud and wake my husband. It was not a five star movie but if you are like me and like scary movies and just want to be entertained it was really fun to be scared by ""The Lights."" Good Job!!"
3,see it,"THE LIGHTS works. Set in a desolate spot in Texas where strange things have happened for many years, the story held me. It's not all blood and gore. It's a film that carries out its promise of holding the viewer in suspense."
1,Lights Out,"THE LIGHTS is categorically one of the worst films I have ever seen. The acting is far more horrific than the horror could ever be. The plot is flat, derivative, and stupid. The premise is tired and overused. The effects are poorly executed. I wanted my time back after watching this one. It was not scary, but silly. The attempts it made to be funny or have a sub-plot failed utterly. The Lights themselves are an aside and are never explained. I think I could say that this movie ranks in the absolute top ten worst films I have ever watched. Destined for the $4 box at local retail stores. I would have given it 0 stars if the option was possible."
5,Depends on your love of the series.,"Eternal Edition Saint Seiya File, to make it clearer, is the original sound track from the first TV series (beginning until 12 gold saints). It contains every soundtrack, fast fighting songs, commercial break song, slow sad death scene songs, etc.If you are a big fan of Saint Seiya and love it's soundtrack, this is a great collection CD to have. Anyone else who never know Saint Seiya or never care for it's soundtrack, you don't need this CD.Because i've been a big fan of Saint Seiya for 20 years I'm rating it 5 stars :>"
4,Fine bulbs,"Bulbs work great. They are what they claim to be. Nothing exceptional about them, but nothing wrong with them as well."
3,Not bad for the price.,"Considering that it's sterling silver, the price certainly isn't bad. The details are nice, it's a pretty shape, but make sure you thoroughly clean off the mouthpiece before using, as the residue of the uncleaned silver tastes awful.Also, the opening of the holder (where you stick the cigarette in) seems a tad small for anything but cloves. A bit of a pain to have to twist regular cigarettes into it."
3,try & try again,"Omar Epps is great in this movie. Its a sometimes sad yet uplifting story of one inner city youth's travels through the rites of passage that exist for many inner city Black Americans. As the movie shows the price of failure is high, frequent and unforgiving, and even if you do cross the passage, the rewards of success are met with many formidable obstacles that will test your perservance & your heart. Its not a fairy tale though, very realistic with alot of drama. I liked Omar Epp's acting and the music, especially at the end. An excellent movie"
3,Written for the West - nothing of true value,"I have read many of Djilas' works and this one was written for the western readers who are craving information about decadent behavior by Stalin and his closest assistants. Considering Djilas' high level position, this book could have been much more insightful and could have provided more interesting insights about the Yugoslavia and SSSR at the time. In my opinion, this book is a compromise to say as little as possible about Yugoslavia at the time, and to make it commercially successful in the West.I do not blame Djilas for what he wrote, he was in a sort of house arrest for almost 40 years, but based on the fact what he knew, and how central he was in those days, he had so much more to say, and I do not see it in this book. Again, a book is an easy read and a compromise for a large commercial market."
4,Conversation with Stalin,"The author was a supporter of Stalin,but some times he became an opponent. Therefore I found the book interesting."
1,Not worth it.,"The AAA traveler road assistance kit is a waste -- of space, money, and materials. Luckily I bought this for $8 in a clearance bin at my local sporting goods store. If I had bought it for $33 I would have been outraged. The emergency supplies are the worst quality imaginable, the flashlight is pathetically weak, even the bag it comes in isn't very good quality. The only reason this kit deserves even one star is because you can't buy this kind of ""storage"" bag and a pair of jumper cables for less than the $8 I paid. Save your money, and piece the kit together yourself."
1,AAA 63 Piece a deceiving item,"Way below expectation. ""63"" piece ad is a deceiving trick. Bad. They count a single band aid as a piece to make the whole package a 63-piece item. It is like an illusion. I felt cheated."
