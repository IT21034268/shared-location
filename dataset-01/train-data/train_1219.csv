4,Better than most,"There are precious few good werewolf movies - seems like Hollywood pumps money only into the vamps. Well, here's one that is a three star script, but gets massive points for originiality. The four stars in this review are for giving me a werewolf film that's not like every.single.other.one out there. It's a fun movie - not scary, more of just an action flick that happens to have realy, really long canines."
2,lackluster werewolf flick,"Incoherence and stupidity are the hallmarks of ""Skinwalkers,"" a cheapjack horror film about two packs of werewolves (one good, the other evil) who are hiding out in Middle America and doing battle over a young messiah figure who, it is prophesied, will bring an end to the curse on his 13th birthday. The problem is that the bad werewolves want to stay just as they are and, thus, are determined to find the boy and destroy him before he can effect the change.What with its pistol-packing grandmas, its too-cool-for-school, sunglass-wearing, motorcycle-riding lycanthropes, its ludicrous gun battles, and its supremely amateurish writing and acting, ""Skinwalkers"" plays more like a parody of a zero-budget horror movie than the actual thing. Perhaps that explains why the movie provides far more laughs than thrills in the course of its running time."
3,Is That All There Is?,"I haven't seen a good werewolf movie in a long time and saw the preview while watching another movie. I got really excited when I saw that Jason Behr(yummy!) would be in it. It was okay except I found myself confused by the whole theme of the movie. There should have been more background or something, it all seemed to go by too quickly. They look for the boy, they find the boy, there's a fight, and then it's over and the credits are rolling. WTF! If you just like to watch hairy people ride around on motorcycles then this is the movie for you. If Jason wasn't so sexy I would give this movie 1 star but his hotness does help....a little."
4,Skinwalkers....an unknown treasure...,What started as just an action movie turned out even better. I have to admit I don't like horror movies but this one was great. The special effects were wonderful. The acting was much better than I expected. I have to say I watched it because of Jason Behr. He did not disappoint me. The young boy in the movie was also a terrific actor.
1,BAD,"Wow. This one was about as bad as they get. I found the premise to be somewhat enticing, seeing that werewolf films seem to have died out and it would be nice for something refreshing in the genre...but this movie did absolutly zilch for me.The movie is so contrived and uninspired that it actually falls flat from right out of the gate. This is one of those films you will see on the sci-fi channel that you wind up watching and regretting one Sunday afternoon when you have nothing better to do.The acting is sub-par and I agree that some of the more familiar named stars are wasted in this poor example of a monster movie. The only redeemable aspect of Skinwalkers would be the actual quality and ""look"" of the film itself. The movie has a very high quality visual look to it, which helps a lot with actually VIEWING it...but it is still a bomb. seriously, i wouldn't waste my time buying this or even renting it. Wait till it airs on basic cable if you feel the need to see it."
2,Alright for what it was worth,"Skin Walkers had some good points - namely a few hot actors - but other than that the movie was a bit tired. The story was one of those sort of been there done it before but with this tiny little twist in the plot that hooks you on the back cover. I mean who has seen X ""evil"" group riding Harley's and every time a fight scene starts so does the techno. Sorry but this horror fan is wanting a bit more these days. This flick was passable on a slow afternoon when you're home in bed sex (as I was) but other than that...skip it."
2,13 year old boy.............. Kids horror MOVIE?,I think that this movie had a good cast their acting was not all that bad. The 13 year old boy was belived to posses a power that would end the curse of the skin walkers. Some wanted to be cured and willingly died protecting the boy and some wanted the curse to continue. What turned out to be his power was not really all that and this movie could have been much better. I would have said that this movie was made as a horror movie for kids except for a scene of sexuality. Rent this movie if you feel you need to find out for your self but don't buy it unless if you are 13 years old or are buying it for one.
1,1 Star for pitty,"She has lost her grip on what use to make her good, the gritty narrative and street spunk style. Ulgy Man is a shameful attempt to jump on an already gone by bandwagon. What a disappointment."
2,"Just ""okay""","This CD gives me a strange feeling when I hear it. For a new release it sure feels old. It's almost like everyone who worked on this project (Rickie included) were frozen in 1975 and thawed in 2003 just to make this album (not CD). I was inspired by Rickie's 1997 CD ""Ghostyhead"" and disappointed by this well- made but uninspired release."
5,A Must Have,"I have never enjoyed listening to vocals and hearing instruments as much as this. The first time I heard her voice was on sonicnet, online radio and I fell in love immediately. I am interested to know when she will be in Phoenix, Arizona."
2,She's okay but no Sade!,"I was really expecting more from this performer. I bought the CD based on the reviews on this site. I was really disappointed. Samantha's voice seems a bit weak if you are expecting the fullness and maturity of Sades' voice. Over all I would say she is okay but doesn't have any ""personality"" in her singing voice. Save your money.... there are better artists out there."
5,"""The bees' knees""","Phenomenal honey...many/most honeys are good (tupelo, alpine, raw clover, etc.), but Leatherwood Honey is THE BEST! Simply a must-try. You will love it...guaranteed. If you can't go to Tasmania, this honey is a very close second!"
3,Fashion Forms 4 Hook Soft Back Bra Extenders,Purchased these while I was pregnant. They did extend the bra but the elastic portion in the extenders make the bras way too lose. I prefer the extenders w/ multiple rows of loops and no elastic. They enable you to customize your fit much better than these.
5,perfect,i am a bigger gal and these are always handy. i live in a very very very small town out west. the nearest stores are 90 miles away and further. we have a walmart but they only had one size. i needed several.right after i bought yours they got more sizes in!
4,Bra Extenders,An excellent set of bra extenders in several colors for all of my bras. Enabled me to make my bras fit comfortably again.
5,Fun to look back.,"As a true Aiken fan, I enjoyed this book very much. The story of Clay's rapid rise to fame, with the help of his remarkable fan base is interesting, and I am thrilled that it is so well documented. I was there at the beginning, and remain a devoted fan. It is fun to look back and read how it all began, and how we all played a part, each in our own way."
5,Great book,"An exceptionally well written book. Terry Piper has written about the making of a star. Clay had the talent but she wrote about how the fans supported and still support him. I was overjoyed to receive this in the mail. It's been hard to put down ever since. A must-have for any true ""Claymate"""
1,Pathetic attempt for attention,"I purchased this book as a Christmas gift for my mother, who is a Clay Aiken fan. I asked her how it was after she finished it. I usually am reluctant to hear her ""Clay praise"", as we call it. Imagine my surprise when she told me it was terrible.Curious, I read it. Or I should say, I attempted to read it. I couldn't finish it. It's horribly written, self-involved and cheap looking. What an overblown semi-psychotic gesture from a fan who is obviously seeking attention from the very celebrity the book is about. Get a life, Ms. Piper.Clay Aiken is crazy talented. However his fans are just crazy. This book is proof."
1,A Very Misleading Book,"It concerns me that some may take the author's views as fact. When reading what Ms. Piper credits as the reasons ""we"" are such huge fans, my jaw dropped. These may be the reasons she is a fan, but in no way reflect my feelings nor are they representational of Clay fans as a whole. They should have been presented as opinion but were instead presented as fact.In addition, to credit 15,000 (a generous estimate) internet fans with Clay's degree of success when his cd went double platinum the first week and eventually triple platinum is arrogant. Even if each internet Clay fan bought ten cd's, that still leaves 2,850,000 cd's bought by non internet Clay fans. The statement is an insult to Clay's talent and to Clay.If you want to buy the book, so be it, but please do not lose sight of the fact that this is one person's opinion. Question every sentence."
1,Analysis by academic or attempt to cash in?,"I received the book as a Christmas gift from someone who knows I appreciate the singing talent of Clay Aiken, among others. I'm sorry to find out they spent $18.99 plus shipping for something of this poor quality. I can't determine whether the author is attempting to analyze how the internet now impacts celebrity fandoms or if she's just trying to cash in on Aiken's popularity. If it's an academic analysis it's sloppy and jumbled. If it's an attempt to make money off a celebrity's name value it's more successful. I won't even go into the quality of the photographs. If this were really an academic analysis the photos are not necessary."
2,Less than impressed,I think Clay Aiken is a gifted singer and performer and I am proud to be called a fan. This book does the fans an injustice by painting a picture that tells only part of the story. It is like painting a picture of an elephant and only showing a toenail and expecting the public to understand.
1,WHY????,This book cost more that the new CD!Why do people try to write a book about a celibrity? To make money!! It should be against the law! Shame on you.
5,A thought provoking book on the fighting man's duty.,"With apologies to the Bard, but, to escape or not to escape, that is the question. Robert Doyle does an outstanding job of describing a subject that does not get much publicity unless it is in a movie that usually is all glamour and fiction and nothing near the truth. This book is a wonderful introduction to describing how man reacts to the loss one's basic right, the right of freedom. Many take freedom for granted, and it takes the harsh reality of imprisonment to make many realize what they have lost. I am a prisoner, do I risk death and try to escape? Or do I sit and wait and hope to be freed? A wonderful book on the subject of ""escape."""
3,Stop Spinning & Check Out Cowboy Jesus,"Spin the bottle is a slow movie with bad acting but a great plot. Although the movie has alot of potential the development of the characters by the actors is horrible. The editing is classic and good. Jamie Yerke's commentary is amusing throughout. What makes this disc shine is a copy of a short called Cowboy Jesus. It is perfection. The story is crisp, thoughtful and the cinematography is excellant."
4,Give this bottle a well-deserved spin...,"Great performances and deliciously catty dialogue make this engaging indie film a winner.It begins as a reunion of five childhood friends, and turns into a deadly-sin indulgence. Sex, lust, anger, and long-awaited revenge mix up a tasty cocktail. Toss in a talented & attractive cast and some witty lines... and I think you'll walk away pleased.The DVD has a decent (and also often witty) director commentary, trailers, cast & crew bios, and the award-winning short film ""Cowboy Jesus""."
4,What More Can You Ask For?,All I know is that a group of us watched this film and really enjoyed it. We didn't expect to see Oscar performances we just expected a good gay themed story and we got it. It certainly was far above the usual norm for this genre!
3,Could have been a kinder movie.,"This movie had potential to be so much more than it was. The premise of a reunion intended to exact a revenge for a childhood injustice has potential for something so much more interesting and kinder than wicked revenge.I agree that the dialog was catty and wittily wicked and I enjoyed that aspect of the film. What dismayed me was the denoument of the film which became quite nasty. How much more satisfying it could have been if Jonah had come to a place of forgiveness before exacting his cruel revenge. After all, he is punishing adults for the crimes of children and thus the damage he inflicts is far greater than the damage inflicted on him and ,morally, he is more culpable. And the venomous screed by the jilted fiance wishing AIDS on he ex was way over the top. We could have had something as poignant as ""The Barbarian Invasion"", instead we got something vindictive and mean."
3,Beautiful ambient on bass and synthesizer,"This is a good ambient album, but not Eno's best. With his collaborator, Jah Wobble, he's written and recorded a series of gentle, elegant instrumentals. The music is an interplay of bass guitar, synthesizers, and subtle percussion. Most of the songs are full of repetition, but they never feel that way. Eno has a knack for making simple music sound beautiful *because* it's so simple --- he never bores you or takes the easy way out by just repeating the same thing over and over. If you haven't heard Eno's ambient work before, I suggest you start with ""The Pearl"" or ""Music for Airports"" first. If you like those, you'll like this."
5,"Minimalistic, tasteful, somewhat dark-- very nice","According to the liner notes, Eno recorded some basic tunes and mailed them to Jah Wobble to play with. Jah did his thing, adding light drums, simple guitars, and of course bass. Mailed them back to Eno, who then did the final tweaking. The end result is abstract, pensive keyboard meanderings (Eno), underlain by dark, driving, train-track-like repetitive rhythms, plus assorted disturbing sounds (Wobble). Or is it the meandering keyboards that underly the driving rhythms? These are very subtle tunes, and all in all, a great album from two great musicians."
2,Abysmal Sound for half the CD,"I don't know how anybody can give five stars for this album. The sound quality for the first eight songs is really bad. Far worse than usual delmark live records from the 60s and 70s. The second half is about the same sound as comparable CDs by Jimmy Dawkins or Otis Rush, but still a little worse.This makes it impossible to enjoy the first half of the CD, while the second half is allright. If you're a completist, you'll go for this one, otherwise, I think there are better albums to enjoy Magic Sam's wild West Side Blues"
4,The Extent of Enthroned,"Enthroned, though vain, ignorant, and most certainly hypocrates in the realm of black metal have made a masterpiece with ""Towards the Skullthrone of Satan."" The Black Metal epic is a lucid description of how Black Metal should sound; Evil, praising the elector of darknes, and feeding on Blood, Death, and Fire. If one truly enjoy's Black Metal (and for that matter metal/good music in general) one should own this album without thinking twice. Roaring guitars, ambient soundscapes, tearing vocals, and expedient rythem's of darkness.Oro Et Labora"
5,An impressive and unpretentious sleeper,"One of the best British thrillers of the 90s, Under Suspicion is an unpretentious audience picture which doesn't let its passing nods to classic British thrillers of the Fifties and early Sixties such as Hell Drivers, Blind Date and Victim, smother it. Set in Brighton at the close of the fifties, Liam Neeson plays the disgraced policeman turned seedy private detective who, with his wife, arranges the 'evidence' of adultery that British law then required for divorces only to find himself the number one suspect when she and his latest client are found murdered. With strong support from Kenneth Cranham as his last remaining friend on the force and a particularly good use of the scope frame (although the extra width does accidentally catch some very nineties phone booths and TV aeriels in the early scenes), it's well worth a look.The only extra is the trailer, but the DVD does offer a good 2.40:1 widescreen transfer."
3,SUPERB MOVIE,"A very interesting movie. Nice setting, violent when necessary. A good transfer and pic quality. Liam Neeson is a very charismatic to watch in this type of movie."
4,Older movie but a good one--,"I bought this movie on a whim and wasn't disappointed. I have a hard time sitting still long enough to watch an entire movie, but it kept my attention."
2,Disappointed,"The actors have good (and excellent) acting performances and have won awards for other movies they've made. Those facts are the reason I choose this movie; albeit the actors are of a younger age. The plot was erratic and predictable. The stars acting, at best, were mediocre. I wasted my money purchasing this show. Save your money. I would rate this movie a D."
3,Gun Shy,"Good movie, Laura San Giacomo just doesn't sell the sophisticated woman very well. As soon as she opens her mouth it's all over, you know she's really beer and hot dogs not strawberries and champagne. Her acting in this is a little stuffy too, like she's trying really hard to be a grown up."
5,"Quietly hilarious: find it, buy it.","Short-listed for the $25,000 Booker Prize in Canada, 'The Projectionist' was a dark horse in a field which included Mordechai Richler and Carol Shields, with unique observational humour without angst.It's set in a small prairie town dying of drought, and its narrator is a high-school teacher struggling with his wife leaving, a new girl-friend, and a town mystery.But it's funny.The story of how the town's movie projectionist makes up for lost revenue as the town dwindles is alone worth the price of the book.Find it, buy it, and wait for the next book from Michael Helm."
2,"""Wrong Title For This Book""","If you pick up this book expecting to read anything at all about a projectionist or anything about the work a projectionist does, you have the wrong book.There is a person in the book who is supposed to be a projectionist but he might just as well be a well digger, AND he is not the principle subject of the book.The book is written well enough and the story line is okay, but it is a let down when you expect the title to reflect the main character, let alone anything about his work as a projectionist."
3,"Old ""Skool"" Cuban Salsa","This CD was delivered promptly and in excellent condition. The music is an entertaining selection of ""old skool"" Cuban salsa."
4,Great Movie... Widescreen?,"Be sure to compare this version with the ""anamorphic"" version for aspect ratio. Although listed as ""widescreen"" in part of the description, the Aspect Ratio given of 1.33:1 is for ""standard"", not widescreen televisions!Excellent film about proving your manhood and winning love. Horse lovers typically enjoy the movie for the man-horse bond and general nobility inferred to the animal. The trick horse riding through-out the feature, particularly the dangerous mountain riding, are thrilling to watch."
5,"Exciting action, gentle romance: a perfect movie","This movie has everything good to recommend it. Plenty of action with amazing stunts, a real love story, gorgeous scenery that rivals the opening credits of ""Sound of Music"", and a beautiful music score that carries you along with the story. How could any film this good not be a hit?"
2,Good Movie Bad Digital Copy,"This is a fantastic movie. The story really draws you in and the cinematography is breathtaking. This is one of those movies you need to see at least once on the big screen at the theater.I was in the mood the other night to see this again, so I purchased the digital download. I've purchased a number of movies this way and in general I've been very happy with the quality. Note: I haven't purchased any HD versions of the movies I've downloaded. This movie was the exception. The video was grainy and the audio sounded tinny and harsh. The movie wasn't high enough resolution to fill the screen on my laptop.This was the first time I've regretted buying a digital version of a movie."
5,Australian Romance,This is an excellentwestern romance with all the thrills of fast horses andagreat cliff hanger at the end.
5,PLUS - PLUS - PLUS- AND THEN SOME,"Hey, missileman, right on!This movie will intrigue horse-lovers the world over. Definitely a keeper --- guess I will keep the video and DVD copies.Would like to know more about the horse[s] used, especially Craig's gelding. It seems to have a bit of lag when Curly tries to pull off the bridle and when Craig puts it back on again.But who can pick apart a thoroughly enjoyable movie that is such a treat to watch.I would love a copy of the article [Western Horseman?] of how the cliff-jump was orcastrated - what a fabulous stretch of photography - and her cliff-hanger? Wow!Just intensely great!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ++++++++++++"
4,to complete a set,We purchased this film to complete the Snowy River Saga. We missed a few of the original cast but overall it is a good additional DVD. The stunts/riding is fantastic!!!
5,My fave,"This movie is definately my fave. the stunts are amazing and I couldn't believe it when I found out that tom burlinson actually does his own riding. being a horseback rider i know how difficult that downhill scene would be and it's just amazing. great movie, great scenery, great horses, great story go buy it! go on..go!"
5,A great film,"I've seen this movie in 1982. I found it was really a great film. I try to bought it in France, but unfortunately, I cannot find it."
5,awsome!,I own it and I never get tired of it! It's a very good movie.But I think that THE RETURN OF THE MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER RIVER is better.
4,Who doesn't love this movie?,I love horses... which made me love this movie. There were some gorgeous horses. The story is cheesy and silly... but that's okay.
5,Excellent,"Although I haven't had a chance to watch the DVD yet, it arrived in perfect condition and in less than five days! This is a bonus especially since it was during the Christmas rush. I would buy from this seller again in a heartbeat!"
5,"He's not a lad, brother! HE'S A MAN!","This movie KNOCKED ME OUT!One of my favorite films of all time! I first saw it when I was stationed at Clark Air Base in the Philippines. This is the very first movie I ever rented. It was a boot-leg copy, of course. But I was glued to the set. Jim and Jessica! Old man Harrison! Spur! Clancy! Lorraine Baily's character! Even the snot who let the stallion loose ... they were all magnificent! And that horse chasing scene had me on the edge! This will always be one of my faves!"
5,Very Recommended!,"As an australian myself, I can say that this movie is one to be proud of owning. The characters depicted in the movie are very real and believable with strong screen presences such as Kirk Douglas and Tom Burlinson. Tie that all up with the beautiful scenery of the Snowy Mountains and the award winning soundtrack of Bruce Rowland, make this DVD one of my all time favourites.Saying that, don't waste your time or money buying the sequel. It is possibly, one of the worst movies ever made."
4,The Man from Snowy River,"Great sags about a Austrial cowboy wants to prove his is as good as his dad and get the girl, Jessica"
1,I don't get it!,"I don't get it. This movie is Rated PG, advertised as a Family Feature movie, and receives great reviews. We ordered it for our children to see - what a mistake! This film is a good story but it is full of crude language. There are many scenes with curse words that even I don't want to hear. If this is important to you, don't order this film!"
5,Classic,"This is a perfect example of what movies used to be. There is an absence of pornography, and foul language; with a strong example of affection, responsibility, and taking initiative. This is a great movie to show young children between the ages of 5 and 9 years, to help them subconciously want to become better individuals than society would have them become.This movie also indicates that conflict does nobody any good, but sometimes may be necessary to achieve one of the overall goals."
5,Great Movie!,"What a great movie, I highly recommend this and the return(#2) as well. I've seen this a long time ago and still love it to this day. In this movie it shows anything is possible for Jim a young lad who struggles to save his father's land."
5,"Can't go wrong with this movie. It is ""Aussie"" some !","I loved this movie the first time I saw it at the theatre low these many years ago. It has just the right amount of action and romantic interest, and pulls you into the story so you must watch it, then leaves you wanting for more at the end. I loved the ""Mountain Pony"" who can keep up with the Brumbies, and the ""Homeless"" cow on the dinner menu. This one you can watch and enjoy."
3,Cetera Transit Authority,"Missing a lot of his better songs (Glory Of Love, for example) and has these weird remakes of his Chicago songs. Could have been a lot better."
2,Not the same without Chicago,A classic is a classic is a classic. Our dear talented friend has not had much success since he has gone solo. In retrospect his counterparts have not either. It is obvious that Mr. Cetera simply omitted the classic Brass of Chicago in these new versions and replaced it with a quitar. The solution is simple. Put your ego's aside and have a heart to heart with your old friends of Chicago and get back to writing and making hits with them ! It wouldn't hurt to speak to Mr. Gattica and Mr. Foster either.
4,It could be better!,"When you make a collection you put the best of your songs, instead of doing remakes of Chicago`s hits you can put new singles, B-sides or songs that Peter really liked. I think that without so many good songs, the record is missing its essence."
4,"catchy, easy listening tunes","All these songs are great for easy listening; the cuts flow through one another with Cetera's distinct style. I don't mean this in a negative way, but aside from ""If You leave Me Now"" and ""After All"", the songs seem to have a uniform melody, indistinguishable from one another, but they are all uniformly terrific."
4,Worth the sticker price (but still lacking...),"This collection features 11 love songs by a truly gifted adult contemporary singer/song-writer. Some of the songs are re-makes of old Chicago tunes (""If You Leave Me Now"", ""You're The Inspiration""), some are duets with famous female pop stars (""Next Time I Fall"" with Amy Grant, ""After All"" with Cher), and two are new releases (""She Doesn't Need Me"", ""Do You Love Me That Much""). However, this is not my favourite Cetera collection since it is missing some of his biggest hits and only contains ballads; yet it's a worthy buy nonetheless. His ""Greatest Hits"" collection is a much better mix of slow and up-beat songs, and is worth purchasing if only for the pleasure of hearing that ballad-to-end-all-ballads, ""Glory Of Love""."
3,Not quite what I expected... but still decent,"The book itself was in good condition. But there was a lot of writing and highlighting in the book. Entire sections have been crossed out and scribbled across. On the bright side, some of the notations have been pretty helpful in class!!"
5,So Insightful,This writer who I haved followed for many years from his earlier book on Welfare Reform to more recant writings over the last decade at US News and World reports once again shows unique insights that only he is able to offer up--way to go
1,Statistically Speaking...,"The author may feel his point overwhelming demonstrated by his mountain of research, but he should consider the fact that few people can and even fewer choose to climb Mt. Everest. Simply because a statistic is favorable does not mean it must be included to justify every point. This book is so saturated with statistics that the effect on the overall thesis is catastrophic. Furthermore, not only is the volume a problem, but, though I have no statistics to prove it, Americans and readers in general are leery of statistics. They are justifiably leery because it seems that in this modern era, polling is a near-exact science and questions can easily be asked in a way that virtually guarantees a certain response. My, admittedly unprofessional, advice: Drop all but an extreme minority of the statistics and focus on developing the skills necessary to craft an effective and persuasive article!"
4,hospital gift-better than flowers,"What do you get a friend/relative going into the hospital? Well, this book is ideal and much better than flowers. It will make them laugh."
3,Only Old Once,"Not as funny as I thought, not sure if I will use it for a gift. A little sad! Not quite the Dr Seuss norm!"
2,"Less than I expected, even for a $1!! Sorry!!","The book I received was ""sticky"" and the dj was wrinkly... I just think seller could have damp wiped the whole dj off and maybe at least hand pressed it. Yes, I know it only cost me a $1 plus shipping, but... I can't give this one away..."
2,Not What I Expected,"I would not purchase this video if you are anticipating a preview of the cities visited. Filming was primarily of interaction with individuals met along the traveler's journey, rather than of the architecture and historical areas of the cities."
4,Fun for costumes,Ha ha - these mustaches are funny. I bought them for a kid's costume and they were comfortable enough to wear. Just don't wear them too near your nose because it tickles.
2,BONG WATER STINKS! 1 1/2 STARS,"Jack Black, Andy Dick and Co. do what they can in this pointless and goofy movie. As stoner films go this one just doesn't have many laughs or story for that matter. If you like stoner films, stick to the early Cheech & Chong films. Andy Dick made me laugh a few times, but that's about it. Black has a small role, but he makes his presence known as usual."
4,"Clever dialogue, great characters...","This 1998 ensemble indie boasts clever dialogue, excellent production design and a handful of hysterically realistic stoner characters. The laughs are plentiful and will be quite accessible to those who are familiar with--and forgiving of--today's post-college drug culture, which is depicted in all its slacker glory. (There's nary a negative aspect on display.) The worst part would have to be the title, which may have non-inhaling customers feeling guilty by association when they pay for the rental. Hip young adults and hemp growers will enjoy Bongwater most; social conservatives not at all. --Buzz McClain"
2,an exercise in the mediocre,"I was hoping this film would be better, as the novel it is based on creates a story and world you don't want to have end. The novel has moments of brilliance, and moments when it fails, and I thought someone creating a film would take the opportunity to expand on the brilliance rather than the mediocre. Unfortunately that is not the case here. While there are glimmers of potential, most of the compelling elements of the novel either don't work as presented in this movie or are absent. The character of Mary in the book was endearing, here in the film she is annoying. Why change Courtney's name to Serena? And what's up with the UFO? There's no UFO in the novel, and it falls entirely flat here, especially when it is shown and is so fake looking. Sometimes the filmmaking seems lazy, as if a scene is just a bare skeleton, not fleshed out.I'm disappointed. This film could have been so much more."
1,even the lovely jack black couldn't save this,"i did a really stupid thing and actually bought the dvd when i saw it, 'cause cool a classmate recommended it to me and i thought well why not. my boyfriend and i watched it and the only time we laughed at when we saw jack black emerge as a farmer. brittany murphy was not oversexed in the least. she was just annoying like every girl in the movie, along with luke wilson. but at least his brother owen wasn't in this. the whole art concept to it was boring, and it's a shame that this movie used something beautiful like art to attempt to have a plot. maybe you have to have smoken 40 40 ft bongs to enjoy this movie, who knows."
4,Cheech and Chong vs Wes Anderson,"OK, if you understand the above reference, you probably have already seen this movie. It's part dry, tongue in cheek wit, part sloppy stoner humor. It totally satifies on both accounts, although it may insult or confuse folks who are only accustomed to one of the two styles involved. After all, it's more high-brow than the C&C folks are used to and looser and more fun than the Royal Rushmore Rocketeers may be able to stomach. All in all it's an awesome little movie based on a great little book by Michael Hornburg."
3,parties in Portland,"Being young was never my lifestyle. I have met young people who told me they had a party to go to some night. I was not very interested in people at parties because nothing I said made sense to them. Now I am 63 and regressing like a crazy man who never got hooked on the addictions that have replaced meaning as a significant part of lives in a failing burst of free activity that makes films a slice of life worth seeing just to find out who was better than the face on the cutting room floor. Portland is the setting for Bongwater, with some music, art, and spread the word: I don't sell nickel bags. I expected to learn more from the DVD than the feeling that my entire life did not miss much because I never lived in Portland."
2,"WHAT A BUMMER, MAN","I had high hopes for this stoner movie, considering thecast, but was sorely let down when subjected to a ratherbanal script and disjointed action.The movie is low in the laugh dept. and would reallycall this more of a drama, as it tackles a corny romance,along with the buzz-kills of a house fire and rape.Would not recommend this movie to friend or foealike, though I would recommend a very funny stonermovie in ""Smiley Face""."
1,booooooorrrrrrrriiiiiinnnnnnngggg,"freddy got fingered had more thought put into it than this boring, sad excuse for a movie. they put jack black on the cover to draw attention but he is a guest star at best. and the ending made me wonder why it was made to begin with. its not worth the plastic they made it out of."
1,Sooooooo boring,"I'm not sure why I've heard so many good things about this movie. It is barely watchable. I was so bored I only kept watching it because I didn't really have anything else to do. Maybe you can only enjoy watching other people who are stoned if you are stoned yourself, I don't know. If you are a fan of Jack Black, this is not worth getting, he is not in it all that much. I didn't care for any of the main characters, maybe that was the point, but they were not enjoyable to watch in the least. The ending is so lame I couldn't believe anyone thought it would be a good idea, but I won't give anything away."
5,So soothing!,"This is one of the VERY rare albums that are so smooth, and so soothing, the perfect lullaby, without being some silly cheesy New Age attempt. The mix is perfectly balanced, no disturbing 'too-loud' ot 'too-fast' or 'ill-placed' tunes to distract. Perfect for the very late nights..oh yeah. Got to have it!"
2,"...at the end, we have a copy and its still useful.","Unfortunately, the book provides very little practical information on aluminium welding for a metal shop worker. Instead, reader will get to know a substantial info about health and safety issues (for instance on laser cutting) or technologies not necessary used in a vast majority of welding shops. As an example, there is not a mention of what types of degreasing solvents are suitable for aluminium prior to welding, or sections on filled weld design are also rather underdeveloped. If you happen to manage an aluminium welding shop for welding spaceships get a copy, otherwise check your library first to decide if you really need your own."
2,CD,I ordered this with overnight delivery and did not recieve it that soon. It was in good condition when I did get it though.
4,One of Hans Zimmer's greatest,"I would give Broken Arrow 4 and 1/2 stars, but it doesn't deserve a 5 star rating. This original score is awsome. It may not be like Crimson Tide, but the power behind each note fits the atmosphere of the movie to make it alive. The excellent moments in the last track creates a powerful theme. The CD is rarely found in retail stores, so the best bet is to purchase over the internet. : )"
4,"Not Zimmer's best,but still worth the money...","""Broken Arrow"" is a wonderful score that lacks the power of Zimmer's more famous scores(The Peacemaker,Crimson Tide and The Rock)but there are some nice themes in this one as well.Track one has a nice opening theme,Track 4 and 5 contain some powerful music and Track 8 is the best track in the CD.If you are a fan of Hans Zimmer you won't be dissapointed.This is a great soundtrack,However,If you don't have Hans Zimmer's best scores(Crimson Tide,The Rock and The Peacemaker)buy them first and only then this one."
5,INSPIRING MUSIC,I like it. It is quite melodramatic music and is so cool when the childrens choir sings that wierd latin word-MANUS-TAE.
3,wrong color sent,"just got this for my bedroom, but it definitely does make a loud noise, i doubt i will be able to sleep with it on.. also, bigger than i thought and was sent the wrong color!"
2,Fragile and has an odor,"For a ""portable"" item, the exposed filter is very fragile and the unit has an unpleasant odor unlike the regular Blueair devices. Disappointing."
3,On my desk at the office.,"I have a problem with sneezing all day at work. Ever since I started using the Airpod (about an arms lenght from my face), my sneezing fits have subsided.CON: It is bigger than it should be I think. The filter area looks like a box of kleenex attached, looks cheap. It is very noisy. I am not sure but I think it generates HEAT? Which I hate! this office is stuffy enough now I flip on something to help me breathe but it makes it feel stuffy?"
4,Airpod,This is a very good solution for a desk at work or small personal space.Not to loud and does a good job for it's size.
2,Never received it,The item was stolen off my porch before I received it. Not the sellers fault... but he said he would replace it and then never did.
1,Not as described.,"MH Instruments Rumble Road Premium Amplified Stereo Speakers Black. All I received was a set of handle bar clamps, And they were chrome!"
4,A wonderful read.,"This is a story about 29 year old Beth and her 4 year old daughter Ellie. Apparently, the father has left them for another woman and she's raising Ellie by herself. Beth's hard working as a 'house cleaner' doesn't seem to be paying off when she has to keep dipping into her daughter's savings to be able to afford food and pay the bills. Besides trying to make ends meet, Beth has to put up with a pushy mother who won't stop comparing her to her 'perfect' brother and sister. Then when thigns can't get any worse, she has a fall out with her best friend Fay about something that's pretty big.I recommend this to anyone who's a struggling single mother and has a hard time finding a man. Even if you aren't a mother, like me, you'll still enjoy this funny entertaining book."
5,great product and store!,"Delievery in time, product as described, great price ! I recomend it for my friends , what I dont recomend is to comment cos it dont alow me to say few words."
2,"Skillful but bleak, English noir","The story of a small-time private investogator running into a prime-time, ruthless London gang is well-written and engaging.Harry Thompson is a private investigator, knowing his limitations and taking strictly small, commercial cases. When he helps our a woman on the run from murderous pursuers, he reluctantly--and fearfully realizes that he came to the attention of some very hard characters.Harry is flawed but deeply sympathetic. The book switches viewpoints a couple of times, rahter intrusively but clearly with intent. The cold, wintry weather, first a background, becomes the harbinger of things to come. The book is rather bleak, and while realistic, leaves the reader with a sense of sadness and frustration.--inotherworlds.com"
3,Would be great if you're writing a modern day story,"This book was recommended on an e-mail group, and I immediately went to Amazon to find it. When I got the book, I found that most of the scenarios that are included in this book are for modern day situations. There are some things that would be universal, but many are not. All in all, I'll keep it for the bits that I can use out of it."
2,Might Be Helpful but Probably Not,"I'd give this book an ""A"" for an interesting idea. On the surface, it seems like a good idea. The 30 situational quizzes help you get inside your character's head and can help you figure out how he/she might behave. That could be helpful.But the psychoanalyzing that was included wasn't that helpful. At least, it didn't seem to be to me."
5,A must see!,"This is a review of the newly released Odeon all-zone version in the blue & white case. It will run on your player. The Twilight Zone may exist because Rod Serling saw this in 1955. I am at a lost for words in describing just how weird and wonderful the first story is. When the gods of cinema part the clouds for a moment, this is what you reach for. A Masterpiece! The extra isn't bad either...Orson Welles Return To Glennascaul, yet another ghost story, long lost. Picture quality is fine."
3,"Not enough dub, but overall a good album","Track 2 ""Roots Controller"" by Groove Corporation is nearly sublime. I think it was used as background music in ""Killing Zoe"" when Eric Stoltz was driving down a Paris highway after 'chasing the dragon'. At least those are the images it conjures up in my mind. The rest of the album however is just ok. There is not enough dub to warrant the name of the title."
5,One tough puppy,"Forged (or cast) as one piece, this trowel withstands substantial abuse and doesn't show it. As it is not welded together, there are few if any weak links. The red-orange colored handle makes it easy to spot amongst the foilage. As the handle has a larger circumference than many other trowels, those with smaller hands may wish to consider something else."
1,way too noticeable,"I usually get my bra extenders at Joannes Fabric. I was shocked by the thickness and scratchiness of these bra extenders. They made a lump that you could actually see through my shirts. They dont lay flat and they are big, lumpy and scratchy."
5,Wonderful,I do hope you will have more Michelangeli tapes. I am looking forward for his Rachmaninoff 4th piano concerto. I hope they issue it some day.
2,Glad It was only 152 pages!,"Rockin' Around That Christmas Tree, a joint effort by Donna Hill and Francis Ray, started off very promising. Denise, a lady who's been married for 27 years, has decided that her husband will no longer walk all over her and run everything while she sits back and lets him. This premise was setup very well by page 50. The problem is, the remaining 100+ pages did NOTHING to advance the story. This 152 page book felt like 352 pages because it repeated itself over and over again. Also, why is it that every husband in this story ""needed to be taught a lesson"" with the exception of Edward's uncle? Why couldn't there be one husband who didn't feel appreciated by his wife? I'm sorry, but this ""Waiting To Exhale Lite"" just didn't do it for me."
4,"3/4"" magnets","These magnets serve well for craft applications. They are strong enough for most uses, the rounded edges are desirable, and they are a reasonable size (thickness). Ideally, they would be just a little thinner, but they are a good buy at the current price."
2,It would be good if I actually receive them,"The box was not sealed from either end.Only 100 magnets , not 200, were sent in the open box.I refused the order completely."
5,Magnets were timely and what I expected,Everything arrived in time and the price was right. Would order again.
5,Perfect for bottle caps,"These magnets were a great deal. They are very well made, strong and fit PERFECTLY into bottle caps (which was my purpose). I am making a bottle cap ""wall"" in my bar and these magnets are working very well. I bought a huge bottle of Gorilla Glue to secure the magnets into the caps, but have found this to be purely optional as these magnets fit well enough into the bottle caps and are plenty strong to secure the caps with no glue at all (which makes implementation much simpler). Very happy."
5,Nice!,"I use these magnets to hold my beercap collection to my refrigerator. Magnets seem to be high quality. No flaking and they seem much stronger than the ones I've purchased in the past from the local box chain craft stores, and these are much cheaper! Highly recommended."
2,not very strong,"Right size, just not very strong, only holds 2-3 sheets of paper on fridge. Bought stronger ones at local store for just a few pennies more....making craft magnets with these, hopefully ppl will buy them"
1,DONT BUY FROM THIS SELLER BELLACASABOUTIQUE,"Probably the reason these items don't have reviews is because most people who buy from them DONT RECEIVE THEIR ITEMS, myself included. Then when you try to contact them they don't want to help you, and in the end when you leave them a bad comment, they make-up a ridiculous response next to your comment trying to put the blame on you, UPS, or anyone else but themselves. Sure this product looks good but I've never received it, and I recommend you too don't order from someone who has THIRTY PERCENT NEGATIVE FEEDBACK, and all the good reviews seem VERY SUSPICIOUSLY FAKE.They made sure to bill me for the itme on the second day after I ordered it, yet 22 days later I still don't have it and they write on their storefront that I am hallucinating about it. Goodluck to you all and don't buy from merchants with low ratings like this one."
2,difficult,"Hard for my four year old grandson to have followed. Maybe if he still has interest it will be great in a few years. He so loves the guitar and I thought this would help, but honestly I have yet to see him use the book while playing the guitar and he is 5 now."
2,In the classroom...,I thought my on-grade 11th graders would like this as a review and as a break from the regular lesson plan. They groaned and howled at the corny humor and terrible jokes. My 9 Honors had the same reaction. Strictly for 6-7 graders and in small doses.
1,epic fail,My home was completed about 8 years ago and the electrician installed all Lutron switches; some of them these 3-way dimmers. I've lost count of how many Lutron switches have failed. These switches are far too expensive for this kind of failure.
5,Real Deal Pt. 2,"I bumped into The Big DooWooper first cd ""I Get Joy"" by accident andloved it. I like this cd even MORE! Mahalia Jackson is ""The World's Greatest Gospel Singer"" and this is the ultimate tribute. He did her and Gospel Music proud. I wish I could give this cd 10 stars on 1 to 5 scale. Great songs, wonderful piano playing and The Voice - It bittersweet, pained and Very Joyful. I said it once and I'll say it again - The Big DooWooper is ""The Real Deal""! - GET THIS CD -"
2,No redeeming characters,"We read this book for our book club. Unfortunately, few of us liked it. Even the heros of the story left much to be desired. The plot was so promising, but the lack of any message or redeeming character was a big disappointment. I couldn't recommend this book."
4,Wow ....heavy.......thick.......and bad-ass. You've been grin-f**ked!,"If in any way you enjoyed their self-titled release you will love this one. There is a direction and continuity on this album that their first did not have. A certain kind of release for Dez that the first did not entirely acheive. The songs are heavier, the writing is better and the production is great. Many stand-out tracks and only a couple of average ones. Many will forget about Coal Chamber after this one. And quite possibly that is a good thing."
5,BETTER THAN THEIR DEBUT,I downloaded this CD 2 months ago and havent stopped listening to it since. Im about to buy the cd today and support the DevilDriver. This CD will rip you a new a** hole. Ive seen Devildriver live 3 times and am going to see them again in 3 days. My favorite song is Ripped apart but the entire CD is excellent. Their new guitarist is so much better than their old. If you liked the first CD then you will enjoy this album. This is my favorite CD so far of 2005. DevilDriver see you at Sounds of the Underground .
4,label it what you want..its still rocks,"With so much rock music being released today, its no wonder that everything gets a lablel. Nu Metal, Metalcore, Alt-Metal..Hmmmm..Whatever the new labels that we put on rock and metal acts today the fact still remains that half these bands are a bunch of sellouts anyway, cant play for S**T and, will soon be sitting on discount racks across the nation. Then every once in a blue moon there we can breath a sigh of relief when a band comes along like DevilDriver. As a big death metal fan, as well as many other forms of rock and metal, I really enjoyed my experince listening to this CD. As I was never a big fan of Coal Chamber and other rock bands with that criteria, DevilDriver comes along and gives fans of all Metal to smile about. Check it out...We might have sometime good hear..A solid B**ls to the Walls, in your face Metal band. You would thank me if you could"
5,Awesome,"I always loved Coal Chamber but would get a little annoyed at the soft moments. Devil Driver is amazing, they actually make entire albums as apposed to a radio song and a bunch of other junk! I own all their albums but this is my favorite."
4,solid release.,"I didn't like Coal Chamber, but I won't hold that against Dez. He is writing some great metal tunes now. Heavy, fast, and memorable. I prefer their debut over this one, but this is still a good cd."
4,So wicked it makes me feel like I'm doing something bad buy listening to it!,"Hell Yes this CD Kicks A$$! I picked up this CD on a recommendation of a good friend that has the same taste in music. I was hooked after the first time I listened to it. If you liked the original Coal Chamber, you will be very happy with this release.The vocals are true to Dez's style and the riffs are a lot heavier than Coal Chamber. Some of the highlight tracks on this CD are: GRINFU@KED, loud and angry from the start. RIPPED APART, sounds a bit like Slipknot but still a good track. DRIVING DOWN THE DARKNESS, medium speed but good rhythm and drum line.For comparison, some of the other bands I listen to are: Slayer, Lamb of God, Tool, Ministry, Shadows Fall, & Pantera."
4,Very good indeed!!!!!!!!!!,Especially Impending Disaster! crank it and slam your head against the wall! Dez and co deliver here.... Solid!
4,DevilDriver,"Great groove metal release. Fans of Pantera,Chimaira, Meshuggah, even System of A Down would all agree. Great riffs, drums, arrangements. Only gripe is the vocals are a little dull but this is a very minor thing. Great record, lots of fun."
1,I will not order this from amazon agin,"I received my order, it was supposed to have 120 pills in the bottle, when I opened it there was only 49 pills and the expiration date was 09/2012. I will never order these from your web site again. Joyce blair"
3,Original Review Deleted...Stars Drop,"Measure the width before purchasing. Ok quality, looks like they'll hold up, but I couldn't use them because I made the mistake of going by the picture thinking they'd work on a thinner strapped bra when I ordered the two hooks. Apparently means for industrial thick bras. I am keeping for hopeful future use & I know it'll cost me just as much to just send them back. Arrived in a regular small yellow envelope."
2,poems are okay but not of Ho Xuan Huong,"I spent six years in Vietnam as a linguist during the war, and have remained familiar with written and spoken Vietnamese because of various business ventures. The translator undertook a major task here, because the subtle meanings of language, the idioms, change with time. As best I can tell, he misses the mark often, and seems to have relied on a dictionary and his own poetic skill. You can actually look up in the Vien Ngon Ngu Hoc dictionary, and see how he pulled translations from the dictionary. People may or may not like the poems but I don't think they reflect the original of the author. It is too bad that the translator didn't consult more with native speakers, which generally would be standard practice."
2,they don't work if you need to keep the switch ON,"These things seem like a good idea, but in practice they allow a tiny bit of movement of the switch, and in many cases that is more than enough to break the circuit long.These would probably work great at preventing someone from turning on a switch, but as for preventing the interruption of power by keeping a switch ON, they fail.For that matter, these might even be dangerous for this purpose since they allow just enough movement to break the circuit, but not by enough that the electricity cannot spark over the gap.And sparks inside the wall can be a very bad thing."
1,Rip-Off...,"The shipping & handling is outrageous!!! Don't make the same mistake I did, go to the Hardware store and save yourself a lot of money... Ripped-Off!!!"
2,Good if you don't want to use the switch at all,I bought this to keep from turning the oil burner off by accident. It was great until it needed to be shut down for service. You have to undo the screw to work the switch. The burner guy said this could be a safety hazard. I then bought the Clearview switch guard which is great! It protects the switch from accidently being turned off but also gives you easy access to the switch if you should ever need to use it.
5,Better than I expected,"The switch lock is hard to see in the picture. Using the screws already in the light switch plate, you either attach it with the top screw and the lock down (keeps the switch off) or the bottom screw and the lock up(keeps the switch on). They are nearly invisible and believe me - it keeps expensive outdoor lights off, and my TV and DVR box on. I highly recommend these - with one caveat. They don't ship from Amazon but a third-party vendor. The shipping costs were only $1 less than the locks (I bought 2 sets). That's nearly DOUBLE the actual cost. Buying this way is awfully darn expensive."
5,These things are GREAT!,"I went to my local Home Depot and they said they didn't sell anything of the sort due to product liability issues (WHAT???) so I had to look online. After seeing several different solutions that all involved either replacing my existing wall-plate or attaching something that was obvious (like a switch cover) I ran across these little gems and the rest is history. I purchased three sets for me sometime in 2010 and then went through my purchase history (Thanks Amazon!) so I could buy three more sets for my father-in-law right after Christmas 2012.They are small, clear and not obvious. And most importantly, they do exactly what I need!"
3,"Ok, but had to super glue them together","This is a good idea, the notch was just about a millimeter or two too short, the light switch could be pulled down just enough to interrupt the electricity. I took the second one and super glued it to the to first one and now it's working great. My switches might just be a bit different from the one they used when designing this. All in all, I'm glad I bought it, I'm not sure that anything else would have worked."
4,Good Guidelines to Live Healthy,My wife and I liked the way the author explains how different lifestyles and eating habits effect a person's body. Explanations of how the body processes consumptions is a big help. This is a no nonsense book that allows a person to utilize many techniques to live healthier.
2,blue guitar,"the guitar arrived in a huge box - seemed to be ok - but, before we realized it - we discovered that the guitar was not really very durable - it was dropped and cracked very quickly - many heartbreak tears later - we couldn't fix it and it had to be thrown out - it cracked between the shaft and the guitar itself and broke in two pieces - for a little kid who loves music and had just received the drum set that he absolutely adores ( cymbal broke and dad was able to repair this) it was very sad - i don't think that i will order another instrument online again and will, instead go to the store itself. sorry - it was very easy to order thru the email and i was very pleased with the response and quickness of delivery but the product wasn't very strong for a child."
4,Great stuff,"I'm a big Harp and Grand Organ fan so this hits the spot for me! Not all cuts being duos was a bit of a let down and the price for a new CD was something insane like (...)...so, yeah, used at (...) or whatever was nice and a real good listen-Came pretty quickly and was in fairly decent shape. I'd recommend."
5,Another HOMERUN by: Terry Collins,"The colors in this book make my kids busy for hours on end! Parents, if you like me and need some time with your spouse then GET THIS BOOK!!! the words are very easy to learn and my kids love for me to read to them and gives us a chance to get together after a hard days work. Terry Collins is the MAN!"
1,Sleazy Jailbird on Cover? ZERO Stars,"You probably have many of the best cuts from this collection already, but just for having that nasty self absorbed ex-con on the cover - ZERO stars"
5,Would like to buy this movie on DVD (even better on HD-DVD or Blu-ray),"To be honest I have not seen this movie as I don't want to buy it on tape!I'm keen on owning it on DVD or, even better, on HD-DVD or Blu-ray.The main reason for it is the shot of the orchestra that plays the music is included. As I'm related to John Amans who should be seen on this movie, I'm keen on owning it in the best possible quality. VHS is not an option.I'm sure the movie itself is worth watching as well, if only out of historical point of view.So, what's keeping the industry from issuing those gems on 21st century systems?"
4,great corn... especially for small corn lovers,"small kernels lead to small popcorn... wonderful flavor... i like to use this when i make kettle korn...1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup oil, 1/2 cup kernels into a popper... AWESOME!"
2,pop corn,taste great but if your using an air popper not so great the little seeds will fall out before popping.
4,Not for air poppers,"When I bought this popcorn, it was because Amazon recommended it or at least showed it with the air popper. As other reviewers have said, this popcorn does not work in the air popper. It hasn't got enough weight to stay in the popper long enough to pop. That same quality - lightness - is actually what makes it good popcorn otherwise. I recommend it for stove top popping in a deep saucepan with a lid."
1,"Nothing but ""deadheads""","I ordered this because Amazon recommended it to go along with the Redenbacker popcorn popper I got from them. Hey, only a few of these actually pop! Most of these small, unpopped kernels get thrown out of the popper. What an absolute waste of money!"
3,It's okay,"I bought this for my husband, who loves popcorn, to pop in our air popper. The kernels are SO tiny, which makes it fun for us to eat, but also makes it difficult to pop all the kernels in the air popper. Not to mention, unless you put a towel over the mouth of the air popper, the popped corn goes all over the place. It tastes fine but for my personal taste, next time I'll stick with just regular old popcorn kernels. There is no noticeable difference in the hulls on the Ladyfinger vs. normal popcorn anyway."
5,Ladyfinger Gourmet Pop corn a hit!,Love this kind of popcorn and bought several bags to give in Christmas baskets.Got rave reviews from old and new recipients.
2,Probably the worst of the Amish popcorn types,"The kernels are very small, much smaller than movie theater popcorn. There are also a lot more unpopped kernels and because the popcorn is so small, it tastes like I'm eating larger hulls because the ratio of kernel to hull is closer. This is the worst of the three Amish flavors I tried, with Baby White as the clear winner. Skip this and go straight to Baby White."
1,Stale - Hull O' Plenty - Unflavorful - I'm Out the Money :(,"I cannot believe the vendor had the nerve to sell this nasty, bottom-of-the-barrel popcorn to anyone. Not even fit for a pig's slop."
2,lazy pop,"Disappointed in this popcorn, too many kernels did not pop, in the future I will not be purchasing this popcorn from Amazon."
2,Not so good,"When I was a child, my grandmother got some popcorn sent to her straight from the fields in Missouri. It was white and SO tasty it didn't need butter or salt. I've been on a search to find more ever since.This isn't it.The kernels are quite small but, worst of all, only about 40% of them pop. That's a lot of ""old maids"" and makes this tuff pricey indeed.I contacted the seller with the issue; they told me to pop it at a lower microwave setting -- didn't help.I gave it 2 stars only because what did pop was OK-tasting.Keep looking..."
1,Not for hot air poppers,I blame Amazon.com not Ammish country for recommendig this otherwise good popcorn when I bought a hot air popper. the instructions with the popper said don't use small kernel light popcorn. they were right. it all just flew out of the popper before it had a chance to pop
4,Installed with plumbing simple tools,It is hard to tell if it is working as with any filter BUT I do think there is less clouding of the dishes in the dishwasher and that is what I wanted.
2,galvanized T-fitting creates rust??,"After water sits for a day or so, I have to wait a few seconds for rust to clear out of the hot water line. I'm pretty sure it's coming from the fact that the T-fitting on the filter is galvanized. The only way to find out for sure is to pay a plumber again to replace it with a copper fitting or to install a different filter that doesn't have galvanized. I'm not looking forward to shoveling out the money. I don't know what else could be causing it. I'm pretty sure I am right about it being the T-fitting."
2,It lightens too unevenly,"I had better luck with the Maxi Blonde kits from the drugstores. I could never get 7th stage to lighten evenly...some parts overbleached to white, while others only turned brown. Also it spread and ran onto previously bleached hair as it was processing. What a mess."
4,back brace,"difficult to get adjusted to your waist size, once sized appropriately, it provides adequate support to keep you upright. Velcro difficult to get right each time."
5,The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,"Purchased an 8 volume used set of the ""History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire."" Although sold as used, each book is in like new condition. I received the set within days of placing my order, and the the set was well packaged to protect from damage. I am a very happy customer!"
1,Unspeakably awful,This couldn't be much worse. It was more about the host trying to convince you that he was cute than about New Zealand. A wasted hour.
3,"Metophorical, Riveting,..","The Thieves of Ostia proves to be a very action-packed tale. Four children from completely opposite worlds come together as one -- A slave girl, a beggar boy, a Jewish boy, and a Roman girl, set out to solve a mystery, but end up unlocking the ""priceless treasure"" or humanity.The book is metophorically related to Christianity. It was hard to read because of lack of detail in some parts, but had a good story line."
3,"fast-paced story, but annoying distortions","This fast-paced story leads young readers through an action-packed adventure whiletrying to introduce them to Roman life in the first century CE. While the storygrabs the reader's interest from start to finish, historical distortions abound.Historical objects and their uses are described well in context, and the violence ofeveryday life feels realistic. But social relationships are modern and contrived.Twenty-first century cultural diversity is forced upon the cast of characters so that arich sea captain's daughter, a Jewish/Christian convert boy, a black Nubian slave,and an abused tongueless beggar boy become instant friends to solve a crime.Unrealistic depictions of human nature, scientific fact -- even dog behavior --distract from the story at every turn. The special thrill of historical fiction, ofimmersing oneself in a different time, is missing here."
5,All I can say is WOW,I too came to this soundtrack looking for the Night Bird song. I am glad it was not there ! I had to go look at Deep Forest to find it and ended up buying 3 Deep Forest cds(so far).The first track is a great industrial song that does not go with the rest of the cd but I love it anyhow.This is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. I played it several times a day for weeks.The moods of this cd range from energizing to tearful. My normal interest is in Gospel/funk/jazz.This is not -- and I loved it anyway.
5,fablous dish towel,I ordered a variety of cotton/linen towens to see if they are as wonderful as they used to be and they are! These towels cut your drying time in half. They are so good that I ordered another set to include in a wedding gift. Armani International is the only company I could find who has this 50/50 blend. They are worth their weight in gold. They will last for years and years.
1,ZERO STARS for the corrupt hag on cover,4 stars for musical content - nice collection of songs you most likely already have. ZERO STARS for the corrupt hag-hostess cover.
4,Good deal for a Textbook!,"This book was in great condition and arrived on time as stated. It was less expensive than the texts available at the University, a great deal!"
5,"Danger,Danger,Danger","Warning:Danger,Danger,Danger, only watch this video if you are looking for extreme ""Action"". Steve and Terri Irwin once again bring our hearts to a stop as they work hands on with the crocs to keep them safe. See Steves daring ""croc"" rescues as he risks his own life for thiers.

3,Yet another Linux walkthrough,"I've read a bunch of these linux walkthroughs now and I haven't been impressed by them, this book included. The problem is that the coverage is too sweeping. There are too many screenshots and the coverage is way too broad. It's unclear to me how simply booting up a Linux distribution and playing with it for a little while isn't just as good as having this book walk you through it.That being said, if you are really nervous about Linux and you want a canned walkthrough to show you how to install it and use the basics, then you should have a look at this book."
1,Unavailable?,"I don't know if this is any different than the other cd here with the same title, but that one is available now."
1,Don't even think about it! Warning!,"Please do yourself a favor and if you want a watch that looks like a classic and do not want to spend the money to get one, do not buy this for the prices that they are trying to sell these at. The movements are very inexpensive made in China and the construction of the watch will not pass for a quality time piece at all. These watches can be had for $49.00, $59.00 and $89.00 dollars.Someone is playing a game at 595.00-890.00 for these so do not fall for it. I can not believe these guys think they can pass these off for those prices. I own one I bought for $59.00 dollars new and wear it as a fashion style item with limited dress shirts. When you are up close on these styles you can see the low quality and poor construction of the watch.Enough said, DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER ANY OF THE Steinhausen watches unless you get it for under $70.00 dollars and know it is all for show and not a quality lasting watch."
5,How to Succeed in the Game of Life,"Never before have I read a no nonsense book about business, relationships and daily problem solving that I can apply to my own life as well. Ms. Glaser approaches her ideas and concepts in a totally fresh and inspiring way. Most leadership books give you the theory of problem solving but in Creating We, the author encourages readers to come out of the ""group think"" and aspire to even greater heights of productivity, community spirit and a more intutive sense of self awareness...This is the bible for anyone searching to find more success in every area of their lives."
5,One of the better acoustic cd's I've heard....,"I saw Damon and Brother Cane in 1992 and was really impressed with him and the band. I've picked up all of the Brother Cane releases over the years and came across this cd on his website. Wow!Great work from a very talented singer, songwriter, and guitar player. There's something about his voice that really makes him distinct. Anyways, do yourselves a favor and pick this one up. If you are really interested in getting it and can't through Amazon.com, check out Damon's website and there will be a link for it there.You won't be let down. Great stuff"
1,Scratched up CD,"CD was advertised as in ""very good"" condition. It was badly scratched up when it arrived. Would not purchase again from this seller."
1,Customer support for this item is not available,"(...) I ordered the above card that I expected to be usable in my desktop PC (see description of card above - indicates ""PC""). Instead, I discovered when I received the product that it is intended ONLY for LAPTOPS!I then tried to contact their customer service. I have been forced to leave numerous messages because no one ever answers the phone. In addition, they never call back. I have sent email but not received any response at this time.My recommendation is to avoid purchasing anything that would result in going through that vendor."
4,Little World of Don Camillo,"Book was a hit; it was a gift for a family member. Jacket was a bit worn for how it was described, otherwise no complaints."
5,Excellent rhythms and melodies well worth the purchase,I originally purchased this on a whim some time ago and fell in love with the subtle difference between the irish sound and the breton sound. The only problem is that I let my 15 year old bleached haired hard out Tool and Korn freak son listen to it as well. Now I have to try and find the CD in his bedroom if I want to listen to it as he hides the CD so that he has exclusive listening rights!! An unusual turn of events. The music is romantic without being soppy and very evocative for those with a leaning towards past life experiences-my head becomes filled with pictures of past events. It has now sent me on a hunt for any similar type of music-traditional rather than modern as Stone Circle is. Do listen to Celtic Wedding if you are a Celtic music fan. I doubt that you will be disappointed.
4,May be a little too studious and cultured for many listeners,"I like the Chieftains a lot, love some of their music. I love Irish music, especially the moody traditional OR electronic/ethnic updates or variations on the Celtic sound and this album falls in the former category. I find it a little long in the tooth, actually, and have to get into an academic frame of mind to fully appreciate it. I've tried to listen to it several times, but find my mind soon wanders and, unlike so much of the Chieftains music, the tunes don't stay in my head. Definitely a mood piece and best appreciated, I suspect by serious Celtic or Chieftains fans."
3,"Still a fan, but not my favorite Chieftains CD","I love the Chieftains, I think I own almost every one of their CD's. And even though this one is okay, I found myself skipping ahead to see if the next song was better or interesting. Again, I love the Chieftains, just not a fan of this CD."
5,awesome second LP/CD,"this 1968 release ""World In A Sea Shell has the same brilliance & maturity & compares strongly to The Beatles Abbey Road"""
5,"Her best album, one of the best of 2007","Drastic Fantastic is the third KT cd i have (the other two are Eye to the telescope and Acoustic extravaganza). After just one listen through the whole album, i fell in love with it. this is her best work yet.My favourite songs here are:- Little favours --> great opening, very catchy- If only --> great guitars, great reff- Funnyman --> THE BEST SONG HERE!- Hold On --> first single, very catchy and has a great beat- Hopeless- Saving My Face- I Don't Want You NowThis album is very different than Eye to the telescope, but her new style and vocals are great! A Must buy album of 2007."
4,A Lot of Fun,"Finally, a second album from a promising songsmith that isn't the pits! An actual improvement IMHO over her first. A bit more rocking as a whole, but finishes up with three pensive tunes.My personal favorites are ""Funnyman"" (a rocker) and ""Beauty of Uncertainty"" (slow Western feel)."
5,Fantastic !!!,"If 60's & 70's R&R; music, ( Artistic, Creative , Intelligent ) was music you enjoyed, you MUST listen to this album. I don't recall being so impressed since Seger's ""Night Moves"" album ( which came at the end of that great era of music writing & playing. Indeed his line; "" don't take me to a disco"", saw the musical abyss to come..)Allusive, intelligent lyrics ( 'light' Dylan if you will , the antithesis of disco & rap), very well crafted tunes, and an excellent vocalist ( with an attractive hint of ' wiskey voice') combine for an outstanding album. Don't think I've listen to anything else since I got it, except her first album ""Eye to the Telescope"" ( good, but not as)."
4,"Very good mix of music, moods","Talented Tunstall offers up a nice variety of musical selections in this enjoyable collection. My personal favorite is ""Hold On,"" which is unfortunately short (under three minutes) and I do admit to preferring her upbeat tracks.It is a well produced CD and shows off not only her talent, but the promise for future albums and a long career to come."
4,I was surprised...,"First, The release of this was a surprise. The last release had been enjoying such a long life, continuing to pick up new fans. I hope ""Drastic"" wasn't released too soon for K.T.'s sake, because...Second, this is a very good release. I'm not going to compare,etc. 'cause I don't like that-each effort has its own reason for being and an artist should be respected for that. Very catchy tunes, every bit as entertaining as the previous, which I have not listened to since I bought this one (thus my first point).Third, why have I not seen even one review of ""Drastic Fantastic""? I have my thoughts on the matter but time will tell. Let's just say that K.T. Tunstall will not be a one hit (or even two hit) wonder. Thank you for sharing your artistry, K.T. ."
3,Not memorable...,"The songs are not as memorable as those on the first album, but it has it's own qualities. I find it a bit darker and less poppy. Nothing really stands out here. Sorry. I was hoping it could have been a second truly great album from here, but it's not. I've noticed as of gotten closer to 40, it takes a lot more to do it for me."
3,Couple of good tunes.,"I think KT kicks major a--.Drastic Fantastic feels a little rushed.There are a couple of good tunes, perhaps if she took a little hiatus she can return to her greatness, but lets face it, great songs are a rareity and KT has already had many moments of greatness.""Mr. GLM"" White Plains, NY"
4,The whole album is drastically fantastic,"I bought Drastic Fantastic because I loved Eye to the Telescope (ETTT) so much, and I was surprised but definitely not disappointed. This album has a few more mellow racks than ETTT, but the lyrics are great, the tunes innovative and complex, and KT's great vocals really shine here. Haven't found a track on the whole album I didn't like - very unusual for me :-)"
2,Hated the Cherry Tree song. But this album is OK in moderation. 2.5 stars,"Poppy and somewhat edgy in places, KT is the prime example of an artist with limited talents. She plays the guitar pretty well. But the songs run out of steam after a while.Little Favours is harmony Heaven. But otherwise, not the wisest choice as the initial start out to an album. Not by a long shot. White Bird is pleasant though and would've made for a strong opener. Sure, it's a little too calm for it's own good. But is a great song all the same.Yet another singer-songwriter caught up in the glitz and glamour of this particular lifestyle and destined to get lost in the everlasting sea of stars that shine for a split second and then aren't remembered at all.Buy this if You must but I'm glad I didn't.Download White Bird and Paper Aeroplane legally or illegally I don't care. Just get them and move onto something worth checking out!!2.5 stars."
2,Misleading artwork,"The cover which shows Tunstall playing electric guitar leads one to think that the recording features some hot guitar. Unfortunately, it doesn't. In fact, even on the up beat opening track, there is no instrument break--a typical Tunstall song--unrealized potential. So, we now know that Tunstall can prance around and strum guitar but she can't PLAY guitar. However, all of the songs on the CD are decent if not exciting. It's disappointing that not more was done with them.At 39 minutes of music, this is not a generous offering and shows that Tunstall isn't a prolific songwriter. She has a fantastic voice and should have filled out the CD with cover songs. Also she needs a producer who has great musical ideas and can realize them with supporting musicians, lead guitar riffs and other rock 'n' roll ideas."
2,Falling short...,"Much like her first album, this one falls short. There are a handful of solid tracks, but the rest of the album is a snooze-fest. I found the rest to be quite boring.-JustinP.S. Where are the lyrics? Lame-o!"
3,KT's best song,KT's best song on the cd was performed on Ellen. I loved it and bought the cd. I absolutely love her voice but the instrumentals are a bit tinny and the music sounds redundant. It reminds me of my old Peter Frampton album where all the songs sound alike.
1,It's all about the money,"I purchased ""Drastic Fantastic"" on the strength of Ms. Tunstall's previous recordings. ""Eye to the Telescope and the live ""Acoustic Extravaganza"" both of which I love and am still listening to in heavy rotation. while Ms. Tunstall's music on these is not the most adventurous, it is sultry and not completely predictable. The production is appropriate for her smoky voice. More magical are her lyrics which are tart and clever and tasty with metaphor.To be blunt her last outing is overproduced hooky, poppy wallpaper perfect for office lite-rock radio. ""Drastic Fantastic"" is neither."
2,Feeling ripped off!,"Don't get me wrong. K.T. Tunstall is great. But, the first thing I do when I get a new CD is rip it and save a copy to my music folder. But this CD is forcing me to install a program just to listen to it. I used two computers and neither one can rip it. Now I see Amazon has the MP3 version available. It seems I have to buy it twice!"
4,Why not...,"I just love this gall, this CD is a little less good than the previous, but great nonetheless...I can't get enough of that voice...she sure looks hot..."
2,What the 'ell Happened?,"Aw, man. I was SO looking forward to KT's new album, but this was a complete disappointment. I've seen her live 3 times, and in one show she played this incredible song titled ""Dirty Water""...that isn't on the album. I didn't get hooked by a single song, and while after reading the reviews here I'm willing to have another listen, I don't think it will drastically, fantastically change my opinion. A real let-down from an artist I think has much more than one hit CD in her."
1,"Nothing ""Drastic"" or ""Fantastic"" about this....","This falls way short of my expectations. The hooks are weak, the production and playing are bone dry and this sounds like a half written batch of rushed songs given a high gloss with hopes of the listener loving the way it SOUNDS as opposed to hearing actual quality and content. I am profoundly disappointed and bored out of my skull. Cool cover though..."
5,Simply I LOVE KT,"I know KT many years ago, since her recordings were Acoustic and non Professional, i will always love Kt works, songs and production, I recomend Drastic fantastic, her Second Studio Album, it is Cool, more rocker than Eye to the telescope, that is awsome too but is more folk, :) ,,, I dont have much to say,, just listen Kt and fall in love,, with a real Genious, real artist ,, Non a ""pop"" Manufactured artist,, KT's Soul and heart on her albums.."
4,?,"I thought it wasn't a good as the previous ""Looking Glass"" but my wife (and it was a gift for her) loved it. Great to see there are still artists who can appeal to us ""over 50"" music fans, this is one. Drop the top and turn it up!!!!"
2,She manages to write many pages without saying anything,"I have purchased Susan Maushart's book recently because it was recommended as ""debunking the myths of motherhood"". The book indeed attempts to reveal and dissect the problems with mothers' identity in our society. Unfortunately, Ms Maushart is too enamored with the idea of making all options equal, not offending anyone, and with sounding scientific. She talks and talks, finding many different ways to say the same thing over and over and not telling us anything new. What's worse, she belittles breastfeeding as just one of those dumb old things we were led to believe are better, ""like cooking things from scratch"". It's too bad that Ms Maushart, in her attempt to sound well researched and scientific, has forgotten to actually look at scientific research."
2,Interesting.....but not helpful,"The book was somewhat interesting, but I came away from it with such a bad feeling. The author just struck me as being so very bitter! I would hate to be her daughter and read this book. She and her partner didn't seem to find any joy in parenting at all(except as a topic to write a book about?) I realize the focus of the book is supposed to be on the negatives, but still! I also wonder if a major part of her problems weren't really about sleep depravation combined with a lack of female support. I think there are better books that tackle the subject. It's worth reading only as one of many resources on the subject of modern motherhood."
2,Mixed bag...bold ideas but is she unhappy mother!,"Hmm...really displeased with the anti-breastfeeding twist discussed at length. yes, she discusses the brutal and sometimes ugly feelings of mothering, but it is one-sided. Not one mention of a happy mother or women plesaed with their parenting choices. She's almost anti-female in some of the concepts. Just because no one has presented these ideas before doesn't make them real or true for the majority of mothers. Her unique and personal ""mask"" of motherhood is atypical and does not represent most modern women today. Not empowering, although cleverly done and presented in an adequate writing style. Would not recommend it or pass it on to other mommy's."
3,"good read, worth the time, warns you of the impending perils of motherhood","With everything about motherhood written in a glowing review of the changes it brings to one's life, this honest book was refreshing. It's not overwhelmingly depressing-- it just tells the truth about changes you can expect in your life as a new mom. It seems to me that it's always good to enter a new endeavor with as much information as possible-- and this book certainly helps fill in gaps."
5,Helped me after shock of new motherhood!,"I'm sure there are mothers out there who had a blissful pregnancy, delivery, breastfeeding experience, and LOVE every second of staying at home with their children-or working and still taking primary responsibility for the children.However, for the other 99% of us, this book lets us know that our negative feelings do not make us bad mothers, and are in fact, quite common (if not the norm). I've given this book to every one of my friends who is considering motherhood. I am not attempting to disuade them, but to let them know that if they have negative feelings about the experience of motherhood and birth, they are not bad women or mothers, as our prevailing cultural myths would have them believe."
1,Dangerous discouragement of a natural part of motherhood,"While this book is disguised as ""the REAL truth about how motherhood changes your life,"" its chapter about breastfeeding is one of the most dangerous diatribes I've seen yet, even beating out books such as ""Bottlefeeding Without Guilt."" Maushart's ""it's too bothersome to breastfeed"" bias is especially obvious in her choice of words, such as a line about how mothers who nurse their babies are more likely to be ""DISTURBED"" by their children between midnight and 5 a.m. If you consider yourself DISTURBED when your child wants to see you, day, night, whenever, you've got a problem, and nobody said you HAD to become a mom."
4,It's not just me!,"I bought this book while I was pregnant with No.1. The first time I attempted to read it I was put off by Chapter 1 and put it away for another day. Thirteen months later and now pregnant with No.2 I picked it up again and just can't put it down. Now that I am a mother it seems so much more relevant and I find myself nodding in agreement with almost every page. It's a relief to know that I'm not alone when I feel like it's all too hard and it wasn't meant to be like this! I thoroughly recommend this book to new mums in their mid-30s who have realised they've lost ""control"" of their lives."
2,relentlessly bleak,"Relentlessly bleak, this book makes motherhood sound like an endless nightmare. If you are already a mother, it will reassure you that your trials and tribulations are not unique. If you are not, it will probably scare you off ever becoming one. Over and over again, it describes how motherhood is painful, depressing, thankless, and a major cause of mental illness and poverty. If you managed to reach childbearing age thinking motherhood was pure bliss, this may be a needed reality check. But if you are uncertain about whether motherhood is for you, it will confirm, and magnify, your worst fears."
5,Knife,This knife is easily worth $20 or more. and yet it is dirt cheap. and so are the other rubber training knifes from coldsteel
4,Mostly pleased,"The knife itself was not used for actual combat training but as a prop in a show. It's a great looking knife, even though it is rubber/plastic. The one thing I would improve upon would be to add a sheath to the product so that, knife-fight training or not, a more realistic simulation of using the knife could be practiced."
2,Low end quality,"Not a good product although the price is right mine lasted about 2 months due to the notorious clip failure. Just broke one day while walking along. Unfortunately the United States has de-regulated so much there are really no consumer protections in place to protect us from substandard items and products From China. It used to be you could trust a product just by the company's name. I'm guessing that won't change anytime soon since our Government has decided they know what products we want to buy even if we would prefer products ""Made In The U.S.A"" Big money greed factor at it's finest. I'm now on a quest in search of Made in U.S.A. products and will pay more if neccesary to get higher quality products that last more than a few months. WOW!! what a waist of money."
2,Blackjack Case,"I would not recommend this product, i only had it for a week or so when the belt clip broke. It is not sturdy at all i would more recommend the Cellet Black Noble leather case, i bought this item as a replacement and it hasn't failed me since."
4,another one,I bought this case for my black jack and it fits perfectly. With both batteries. the only con is the clip. after a few months it broke because my sister sat on it. but I like this case so much i bought a new one and this time I'll be more careful where i put it.
1,Not large enough,"I ordered 3 of these for my family. When the long life battery is on the phone, the phone does not fit in the case. The magnet will not connect. Also, the clip on the back of the phone is very cheap."
1,Poor quality,"I bought a planted lily of the valley based on a great photo on Amazon . The price was $ 6.99 for one plant plus S&H; (also over $6.00 ).That was one of the worst plants I have received in mail. The single stalk was small and unhealthy, curved and had two small leaves. I do not want even to plant it, because looks so bad - and probably will die soon.Also, I think Amazon will lose it's credibility by endorsing products of questionable quality.I just ordered a new shipnent of the plants from a new company not working with Amazon."
2,"Love the original, not a big improvement","I got the original copy of swim and was amazed at the music i`d heard. When i heard they were releasing this album i thought it would be massive hit.The day of release i went out and bought a copy, i got home and put it in my cdplayer and was shocked ofwhat i heard, no good new tracks and 2 rubbish videos.Please feeder i expected more than that off u ."
2,Quantity over Quality :(,"These magnets really are not that strong. Maybe twice a fridge magnet, and they seem very brittle and keep chipping away. If your looking for strong magnets, this is not the one to buy."
2,Not very strong magnets,"These are the old fashioned dark magnets that don't hold very much hardly ""terrific holding power"". They make your hands black when you work with them, and break and crumble easily."
1,nothing new to say,"Eighth Blackbird has made their reputation by playing two types of music: bland, lifeless works from timid younger composers or surefire hits from the contemporary repertoire. It's a pity that a group that seems to have captured the ear of folks beyond the new music crowd have such artistically and intellectually bankrupt programs to offer. This CD illustrates my point precisely. The Kellogg is a colossal bore with nothing original to say and only the conviction that the most shopworn clichés can provide musical interest. The Crumb is a widely-known piece and this reading adds nothing substantial to what's already available."
4,Great Addition to your bag,This added a good 10 - 15 degrees to my 25 degree bag. Kept me warm on a cold snowy night in an Adirondack. Could be softer but was the only choice for a mummy bag. Great around the house and extremely light.
2,Bulky and Scratchy,"At an advertised 1-Pound 3-Ounces, it was a little ""heavy"" in comparison to other brands, but that didn't bother me. What I didn't care for was how bulky the liner was when rolled up. If you compare this against other liners, you'll find the Slumberjack is considerably bulkier, which means a lot when backpack camping.I also thought the material was scratchy against the skin, which I didn't thin would feel good when trying to sleep.I did like the zipper approach for making it easier to get into the liner."
4,Good quality- womens bag liner,This liner is good quality- I have slept in it and washed it many times.Great way to add 10 degrees of warmth to your bag- or use this as a summer bag when lows are about 60.This is however a womens bag liner- the zipper is on the wrong side- I do not mind much though- and nobody can tell since its all black.
2,Its OK.,"I didn't expect much and thats what I received, it really isn't much, I've bought better liners for the same price or close to it, this one has not seen much use even in the summer."
1,A total waste of time and money,"If you want a brief, poorly executed tour of San Francisco counter-culture then this is the DVD for you. However, if you actually want to learn about the city and/or plan your trip there, find something else. A total disappointment."
3,"works well, but much smaller than I thought","I bought this kit for my daughter as she loves snowglobes. She made a little polymer clay figure and we glued it inside. It works really well, although it is a bit tricky getting the rubber stopper right up inside. I had thought they would be big snowglobes, but they were really only about 3 inches high inside the glass. If you are making them, track down some glycerin first- helps to slow the fall of the snow inside the water. Although this came with a bag of snow, we added some glitter too."
3,snow globe,"This globe looks nice, but I am really looking for a larger DIY one. Never tried making one before so I'm looking forward to it. I too would like to gather some sand and shells this Summer. I'd also like to add a polymer clay seahorse, if I can find one."
5,a well pleasured lady,"love the story, the characters... i love all her books cannot wait to read another of her books, historical books are one of my favorite"
2,Mixed feelings,"This is the first book I've read by Christina Dodd. Sebastian could have been portrayed much better, I didn't even like him (but I know thats subjective). I wasn't convinced that the pair were in love. The story wasn't ended properly in my eyes because Hadden and Ian's story wasn't reconciled with Sebastian and Guinevere's half (don't want to go into details so as not to spoil anything). Overall, way too many gaps.The odd thing was that I ended up more excited about what was going to happen to Hadden and Ian rather than Sebastian and Guinevere.I'm a little disappointed that my first Dodd book gave me such a negative impression but I'll try to read Ian's story (A well favored gentleman), you never know, it might fare better."
1,the hero is as much a villain as the villains,"It is rare that I put a book down without finishing it. I considered it around 1/3 of the way through this book, as I found the hero self-centered and difficult to like, but I continued. But I quit reading around the 2/3 mark where he raped the heroine in spite of her clear protests. He did it because he was angry with her and believed lies told about her. This is not a man I can respect, nor is Dodd an author I can respect. I have only read a couple of her books; I won't be reading any more."
3,A Well Pleasured Lady by Christina Dodd,"This novel earned three stars from me because I managed to finish the book. This being my first 'Dodd' novel to read (after owning many through used book store purchases) gave me the incentive to complete the reading. However, I disliked many of the characters! Many were shallow, self centered, deceitful and witless. Even the hero and heroine were not my favorite characters. I found the heroine annoying, constantly transforming mentally to the housekeeper she physically masquerades behind. The hero was anything but heroic! However, after many bungled attempts to locate an item which the entire book is based upon, the hero and heroine realize their attraction for each other and accept their fate (strategically planned fate of course) of becoming lovers in matrimonial bliss! While Dodd's writing style may not be my personal favorite (being a fan of REAL historical romances), I will indulge myself in reading one of her novels when desiring a change of pace."
3,OKAY...COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,The book was overall good....but I found myself liking Ian better than Sebastian...but i did like the way things started off in the book...very nice..I don't understand why the picture shows a beautiful red head...but Mary has blonde hair???
3,Please avoid this,"I love to read Christina Dodd's book. But, this was not something I want to read over again. I was getting sick of the heroin saying over and over about ""A house keeper should/shouldn't.."" Enough is enough. She should realize that she is not a house keeper anymore. And, what is the thing about violence in this book? Rape? (that was what it sounded like when I read it). I cannot believe that act was described as romantic. If you love Ms. Dodd's book, please avoid this one."
2,entertaining but a marginal story line with overt violence,"I have only recently read a few of Ms. Dodd's books. While I have found them somewhat entertaining they are not as tightly plotted as you would hope from a writer with mulitple books to her credit. I found her focus in this book on ""forcing"" her heroine to do specific unpalatable things particurlarily hard to take. There seems to be more violence and overtones of rape in the book then I am generally comfortable with. I found myself thinking the heroine needed a lawyer and a restraining order rather than a marriage to the hero."
4,Mystery historial romance,"Was encouraged to read this 1997 book by facebook friend - so good can't believe I missed it back then. The concept of this book is that Lady Mary Fairchild and her brother run away after something 'bad' happens and she turns herself into a housekeeper for fine home. When Sebastian Durant, Viscount Whitfield needs help into the Fairchild home he forces her to return home in search of 'black book' that could save England. This was fun historial romance.If you enjoy this genre I would also suggest;Intimate Deception,The Birthday Scandal,Her Notorious Viscount&Taming an Impossible Rogue."
4,Definitely a Politically Incorrect Novel,"Interesting & different! If you are worried about the political incorrectness of this novel than don't buy it. Yes there is a rape scene (no matter how steamy / erotic it is or how Mary's body betrayed her she still said NO), but it was excellent writing & sucked me in! I now wonder about Hadden's fate & look forward to reading his story! The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wanted more & felt that at the least the author should have included an epilogue."
4,Well Pleasured Lady- a gratifying read,"This was a pretty good read. The story line had some mystery to it as well as some family drama that you could not imagine. I was expecting a little more gratuitous sex but alas there wasn't much. Mind you, what was there was captivating and pretty titillating! Sebastian seems so aloof and pompous but he is a very passionate man who clearly is crazy about Mary. I think this book could really have had a little more passionate 'scenes' between Sabastian and Guinevere Mary, as he called her, but overall a pretty good read!"
1,"No Means No, Rape Means Rape","I bought this book on the FB recommendation of another romance novelist I enjoy, only to discover that the first sexual encounter is a violent rape scene. While the heroine is begging the ""hero"" to stop, saying ""don't,"" he proceeds to force himself into her up against a wall. This book should come with a trigger warning.FROM THE TEXT:""Don't,"" she cried again. Tears brought a husky edge to her voice and she brushed at her face with her shoulder. She didn't want him to see her crying, but there was no place to run, no place to hide. This act was the most intrusive she'd ever endured in her life.Yeah, that sounds like a loving seduction to me.I don't care how well it all works out in the end or how much they love each other eventually or whatever. It's rape.I couldn't even finish the book. I tried to keep going, once I got past that scene, but the author completely lost my respect.No means no. Rape is rape.And the author needs to be reminded of both of those things."
1,not a guide,"Although the video is generally of good quality, there is not enough information about the City istelf. The actual information given could be condensed into just five minutes. I would not recommend this video as an actual guide of Rio."
5,Sweet,"I've had to read this story aloud to my son every night since he was one. He is now two and a half, and it is still his favorite book. When I pause in the story, he easly picks up where I left off and quotes the next line in the story. Unlike some other children's books that I mentally sigh when I see my son pick from off the shelf for a story time read, I have never once sighed for Owen. It is a well writen and cherished book. The illustrations are cute and original and the story is sweet. You'll enjoy"
5,We all love Owen,By far this is my families favorite book.We can relate to Owen. My 3 year old sonhas a yellow blanket that we both love.It symbolizes his toddlerhood and neither ofus are ready to give it up yet.Owen keeps my son and I intriged with hismischievous ways and giggling at his passionfor his blanket.This is a book I'll hang on to to read tomy Grandchildren. Henkes is the best!
1,Bad service,"I was very disappointed with this seller.I waited 2 weeks before I even heard from them. They said they were behind due to the start of school. Very understandable. However, a month later I still didn't get it. They said that it ""must've gotten lost in the mail"". When I looked back at other reviews I saw that this had happened before. I was very disappointed but had to cancel my order as it was for a gift."
1,read carefully,I purchased Owen as a gift. I am embarrased to give this. First their was a mark where a label was on the back of the book but no label. inside the front cover was a white return address style label that was peeling off. There was nothing written on the label but looked like it was used.
5,Owen and his Fuzzy,This is a great book for the child having trouble giving up their favorite baby blanket. It opens up a discussion on the subject for the child and parent.
5,My Fluffy,I really enjoyed this book because it reminded me of my son who is also attached to his blanket. I love how Henkes relates book to everyday children. I think that it is very important to provide children with books that they can relate to. By depicting the mice to have everyday issues draaws children to this book.
4,4 Years??,"I have just starting watching the BluRay version of this, as watching something titled HD and not seeing it IN HD seems pointless. While there are many amazing shots, the HD title should be taken with a pinch of salt. While I wasn't expecting perfect HD colour footage from WWII, most of the footage on these discs looks no better than anything else I've seen in colour on a regular DVD. I would have preferred one or two episodes of just the best footage, re-digitized and cleaned up for HD, than plenty of filler. That said the production is generally first rate.Now for my biggest problem! The opening screen starts with the words ""4 Years"", Now if the disc was titled ""The USA in WWII in HD"" then that would be right, but to start a show with such a misguided statement is just wrong. And while is wasn't 'officially' involved, plenty of US citizens fought and died in the 'other' 2 years that WWII lasted. So in case anyone forgets, World War 2 lasted SIX years."
3,Not exactly WWII in HD,"As it was supposed to happen, there are no WWII images with high quality. In the end of the war, German and American armies started to record some movies using color Super 8, but nothing fantastic. The documentary tells the story of 12 people that, in some manner, were in the front. With real images, their story is told. Only this part, the interviews and new images are in HD. My overall analysis is that the product is intended only to afficionados. The regular espectator will find a boring documentary."
1,'Hollywood' should be kept away from War documentaries,"Very disappointing - typical 'Hollywood' treatment of pushing the ""human story"" behind the history rather than just telling the straightforward history of the war and using the color footage to that effect. Most annoying part is the use of 'celebrities' to voice over the actual people who were there. Right at the very beginning you start to hear a Jewish German survivor explain his past and his view of war but then the producers start to dub over him with an annoying actors voice! Why? The guy who actually lived through it was fascinating - do the producers think the celebrities give more credence to the stories or did they just want to mix with LL Cool J? Don't waste your time on this 'documentary' full of padding, over dramatized voice overs and the same clips being repeated. Get the original BBC series World at War instead."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed to note that I had already seen most of the videos shown in other articles. Although it is a good review, the promised 'NEW' footage never before seen seemed a bit lame to me. Also, the whole video was somewhat limited to those individuals highlighted. I was hoping to see new footage of battles never seen, but it was mostly the carnage left after major battles, the type that infuriate the veterans that suffered through the horror. All in all, it was disappointing to me."
2,Some great shots but a same old story-telling..,"By reading other reviews, my expectations were high, but after watching the images frequently interrupted by a series of lengthy personal story telling, I found myself somewhat disappointed and got tired by the same old Ken Burns-nesque narratives.The original ""World War II - The Lost Color Archives"" (circa. 2000), which covered a bigger scope of this tragic war by witnesses chronicles from various walk of life around the globe, not just by the old glorious veterans, gave me a far more lasting impression of the recorded events.I think It's time for A&E; to come up with a new way of programming for such genre, rather than using a recycled, decade old schema."
3,"Same old thing, different day","I was fooled. Being a WWII affectianado and a gluten for good WWII info, I bought this movie hook, line and sinker. Hmmmm, did I say sinker? I meant Stinker. This was a bunch of old news reels strung together and not very well at that. If your thinking ""Band of Brothers"" think again."
2,Mistitled DVD,"This is not a series about WW2 - it is misnamed. It is a very interesting account of 7 Americans but does not cover the war in its entirety. There is virtually no coverage of the war before Pearl Harbor and the Eastern Front (the largest war in history) is ignored. Practically no coverage of the air or Atlantic campaigns. If you want to see the whole war you have to go with ""The World at War."" Very disappointing as a history of WW2."
2,WWII in HD review and critique,"I really respect Gary Sinise and his work but this series is so jumbled and confusing as to not be in his realm of quality work. I can't figure out what I'm viewing as in most war documentaries and worse , there are no language subtitles and those of us hard of hearing miss much of what is being said. MY God, the audience for this material is the senior citizen and many of us are hard of hearing. Granted I have not seen many of these films but I'd like to know what I'm seeing. I'm consideringa return of this item. Don Mac Lagan"
1,Failure to play on Sony BDP- S500 Blu-ray players,I have tried 4 copies of this item on my Sony BDP- S500 Blu-ray players. They simply will not play on either of these units which have the most recent firmware upgrade.
1,"If you are looking for real ""HD,"" this is a fraud","In the motion picture and television industry, ""HD"" refers to when a digital ""high definition"" transfer is made off of the original film. So I bought this expecting for once to see clear sharp images of WWII. However, most of the digital transfers in this program were made off of second and third generation footage, so the ""HD"" is meaningless hype. Further, absolutely no attempt was made to diminish scratches and dirt on the film. That technology is readily available, and expected from a genuine HD production. Sure, the film is old, but when an HD transfer is made off of the old original film, as was done in their promo, it looks clear and sharp. If you are strictly interested in the historical aspect of WWII this series is okay...no Ken Burns, but okay. But my motivation was to see clear images in real HD, as advertised, and from that point of view this is bait and switch."
1,Blu-Ray will not play on the S-300,"The first disc on thew Blu-Ray will no play if you have a Sony Blu-Ray player model s-300, it does not matter what firmware you are running. Very disappointing."
2,Not what I thought.,I thought this would be like a movie not a documentary! And this is only about americans?! I thought this would be about Poland and British and all the forces. Americans can't make a weirder war movie than this one!
3,Good but...,"WWII in HD has very good image quality. Unfortunately, it doesn't lay out the war in detail about what happened when and why, but more follows the the lives of a few people who were involved in the war. It tends to focus on the emotions of war and what certain soldiers were thinking and feeling rather than a full description of the war in detail. Also, it shows a lot of graphic images from the battle field, which for the most part is fine and realistic. Although, the images were slightly more graphic than I preferred. Overall, a great presentation of the war, just not what I was looking for."
3,WW ll reveiw,"It's OK, but it bounces back and forth too much between the war in the Pacific and the war in Europe. It gets confusing at times."
4,Sony S300 may need more memory to play this disk,"For those that had problems getting this disk to play in their Sony S300, did you check the amount of memory in your player.Some of these Blu Ray disks require adding an additional 1GB memory card to your Sony Blu Ray player. This is installed in the EXT slot in the rear of the player. Refer to your player manual for more details.You should also make sure your player has the latest firmware update installed.Hope this helps."
5,Great timing!,Ordered this as a gift. They saw part of this on T.V and never got to watch the rest. As a history buff they were very pleased that we received it so quick.
3,Video,A good video a great value. This was given as a gift and the recipient was delighted with the information and footage contained in it.
3,Careful HD is not HD,WWII in HD is available in both DVD and BluRay. I intended to get the BluRay but ended up with the DVD version. As we all know DVD is NOT HD. Oh well it still is an interesting series.
2,us in WW II,"This is a production only from the us point of view and images, not a general coverage of the war,from all points of view and filming,though the images and films on the first dvd or hd, you can barely listen to the narrator,because of the volume of the background music, they are good, neat, and some never shown beforethe second dvd or hd is better edited about the sound and voice of narrator"
5,Awesome Gift!,"Bought this for my husband for Christmas, he LOVES it. He's already gone through the first DVD and we've only been home from our Christmas vacation for 24 hrs. Absolutely worth the $$ and much cheaper than I found in retail stores (including Costco)."
5,WWII actual film made into a DVD,"I watched the three DVDs in the set and enjoyed them immensely. Since my husband is a former Air Force veteran, I thought they were put together very well. It is not for someone to view who is faint of heart. Thanks again for a job well done!"
5,Best DVD on WWII I have seen,"I have a lot of materials on WWII: books, DVDs, CDs. I am a Pearl Harbor survivor (I was a child on Hickam Field)and I give talks to school children about the Attack on Pearl Harbor. I am a serious student of WWII and after viewing the final two episodes of ""WWII in HD"" on television (I missed the previous episodes), I knew it was top quality and I HAD to have it. I love it. It is the sort of thing that I will view over and over again. I like that it follows the war from beginning to end on both fronts and keeps it in chronological order. In my opinion, this set is a must for any serious student of WWII history. It ranks at the top of my list of resources."
5,The Best Originial Rare Color Footage Ever,"Origninal Color Footage, rare never seen footage, excelent timeline, show what was going on on both fronts at the same time, by showing the pacific and eastern front in the same seqance. From 12 WWII Veteran's exerances and interviews. Outstanding documentary. A must have for everyone."
4,A very good overview of WWII by many who were there.,"Gary Sinise was a great choice for narrator; ""The L-T."" If one wants a review of our part in WWII, this is a great selection. Meet many who were there, some just in words left for posterity. Few ""young people"" today understand the sacrifices of these men. That is truly a shame. Our country is losing 1,000 WWII veterans a day and it's important to see their story is not lost."
5,One of the best WWII documentaries,"I have watched this series on the History channel and it is unbelievable. Although very graphic at times, the color footage is extrordinary and the comments by the veterans add a new dimension and at times will break your heart. Of all the WWII series I have seen this probably the best overall. The History channel has done a great job. I just wish the DVD was available right now. If you are at all interested in this part of US history or had a relative or friend who served in this war, you will want to get this series."
5,Well Worth Watching,"For anyone interested in history, especially the history of the United States in the 20th Century, this series is well worth watching. The photography is excellent quality and there is plenty of war action to keep even the most adventurous viewer's interest. The best part about this series is that it is real, not fiction, and tells the story of WWII from the point of view of those who actually fought in the war. Some of them came back home and some of them didn't."
4,No Closed Captioning but still one of the best documentaries.,I'll keep this short. WWII in HD is an amazing documentary told by the people who were actually there. Though Hollywood has lent some of its talent to do most of the narration. The visuals are impressive. The scenes are breathtaking and emotional. But why did they decide to not include closed captioning? This just seems wrong that they would leave out those of us who cannot hear. The series is 5 stars hands down but the blu-ray release is lacking almost any special features or bonus content. The exclusion of closed captioning for the hearing impaired just dumbfounds me.
5,Impresive and an excellent source of knowledge.,"I have just seen the first 3 episodes and I can tell that they are really impresive. It is incredible to watch in full color HD resolution movies filmed during WWII. It is tough too, not for young kids. The battles are clearly narrated and in cronological order so it is easy to get the information and to create a good view of the war scenario.I have read lots of books and watched many documentaries and I can tell that this is ona of the best."
5,Perfectly done,"Great production with a fantastic visual exx\perience. Not only did we enjoy watching, the history behind the film is nerve rattling while the footage is breathtaking. Worth every penny. Buy it today, you won't regret it."
5,WWII in Review,"This is a Great combination of WWII history. Great Movie for anyone who likes History and the Excitement, and Action Movies."
1,DVD not actually in HD,"Although they advertise this as WWII in HD, be warned! The DVD version of this is not in HD, because (as a video producer) I know that DVD's cannot display HD media. This would have to be a Blu-Ray or HD-DVD to actually be in HD. This is false advertising at its finest."
4,Good for what it is!,"This somewhat essential book is great, but the use of this book can ruin your campaign. Use this book wisely, and it is a very good expantion book. What I reccommend: Don't buy it until you have the basics down."
3,"Your either Love this, or you hate it","Seems like you either LOVE this book, or you HATE it. It is one of the few supplements that has anything on Psionics, which is rather nice since I am a Psionicist in in a Greyhawk (not Dark Sun) campaign. However, no matter what your view on the book, you have to be careful not to allow super characters. Also, you might want to take a look at Player's Option: Combat and Tactics."
2,Interesting idea that fell way short,"I bought this book, thinking it would help my character creation and turn out some amazing and fun characters. Unfortunately, the character point system is confusing, and unimaginative. You may, if you'd like to, buy these character points! The psionicist section is the only part of the book that interests me. It is a vast improvement from the complete psionicist handbook (although you'll have to buy that is you want all of the powers and devotions). If there are psionicists in your group but you didn't like the psionic handbook, get this book. Otherwise, don't bother."
3,New book can be abusive!,"When using this book for character generation, you will have to be very careful on the use if its rules. Super characters can and have been created. It contains a great deal of information for character generation, but don't let players take advantage of its disadvantage, balance."
4,"Good, but some times, unbalanced","I'm ""young"" in the AD&D games, but this book gives the players a whole varity of options, helping the advancement of the character in the first levels, when it tends to be a very vunerable beeing. The problem is that anyone can take advantage from this rules to make himself a supercharacter, and you know, supercharacters=boring game for the rest of the people."
1,same old suggestions,"didn't like the book, I have already heard those way to save, learned nothing new"
1,Save your money. Common sense is free.,Pay your bills. The balances will go down. WOW. Now everyone who reads this should send ME $10.00.
1,It's was a waist.,I didn't really like it because it was boring and to long. But on the flip side it had some usefull information.
4,Enjoy purchasing books,I received the book from the Seller in a timely manner. The condition of the book was execellent. I would purchase again from the Seller.
2,Too lean to be useful,"There's useful stuff here but only ion the most rudimentary way. I might give this book to a newly wed couple if they haven't the faintest idea about how to manage money but anyone else would already be beyond the elementary concepts of the book.I think Chatzky is simplistic in her approach, too. Her idea is to save at least 10.00 daily by reducing discretionary spending - coffee, eating out, etc. - and using that money to reduce debt but I doubt that the average family can scrape up an extra 300.00 per month by washing their own car. There's just not enough here to make the book a worthwhile buy."
1,Basic Stuff Most People Know,"I read this book thinking it would have the answers for the people I try to help and provide advice to. The jacket and cover reviews would lead one to assume that this book is workable and doable. The author tells you to evaluate what caused your financial problem, as if you had no idea. Then she tells you to set aside $10 each day to pay down debt, as if you don't know that is $300 per month. Then she tells you to refinance your mortgage or get an equity line of credit, call your credit card companies and ask for a lower interest rate, have a garage sale, and so on. All suggestions any person who desires to get out of debt can learn with a basic search of ""get out of debt"" on any reasonable internet search engine. Very basic information that most people know."
3,Good but not great,"Although I agreed with everything in this book, it just did not compare with others that are very similiar like the automatic millionaire. However, it would not be a bad choice for someone who needs to get out of debt and not get discouraged."
2,No new information,"I did not find this book particularly helpful or useful. The concept is that you cut back your spending by $10.00 a day, and then take this money and apply it toward your debt. That is basically it. I think that this concept would have been better suited to a financial advice column, not repeated over and over in book form.Purchasing this book is not money well spent. I find Mary Hunt's financial books to be much more informative, focused, and helpful."
1,Far Too Basic for a Book,"Get ready, here is the book's ""secret"": pay your bills and save more money.Yes, that's it. It is sad that financial journalists can get away with publishing such pithy, obvious advice. If you really are interested in practical ideas to conquer debt and change your life, read Dave Ramsey. This book is far too simple to justify purchasing it. Get it from the library."
5,Buy it...,This book should be read by everyone...once a year. This book and Rich Dad Poor Dad. Very simple but often not taught. Buy it for yourself and buy it for any kids in high school on up. Force them to read it once a year. Period.
3,Too Basic,"There is nothing wrong with this book... but there's not a whole lot substantial either. Look at your budget and see what you can cut for the long term goal of debt reduction.The health care section is particularly distressing - sorry, not a lot of help either. This book also seems to be geared to those in the mid-upper to upper income brackets.Like I said, nothing wrong, but not that helpful either."
3,Not for me,"This book is for you if you have credit card debt. That is pretty much the the theme throughout. Also a lot of what she writes is common sense stuff. If your thinking of buying this, either buy it used (cheap) or get it from your library."
3,Eh,"You're better off getting Dave Ramsey's Total Money Makeover. A much better book. Starts slowly, but if you actually listen to his strategy, it works."
5,One Headlight isn't the only great song on this album!,"I loved this album. With Used to Be Lucky on this import, it is a must have for any Wallflowers fan who already owns Bringing Down the Horse. I enjoyed the acoustic tracks on this also."
3,Addictive,A must-have expansion pack if you want to keep playing FFXI. All the cool kids are hanging out in the new areas. And there's a LOT of content in the new areas.But do you really want to spend so many hours of your life making a fake avatar more powerful when you could be improving you real world self instead?
1,whats the song list ?,"cant really say anything about this one , they dont even give you a song list !"
4,Form proceeds function with this set of dishes,"I fell in love with the graceful lines and understated elegance of this set. But when the pieces were delivered it quickly became apparent that this oversized set is not designed for everyday use. The pieces are difficult to fit into my dishwasher as well as the dishracks purchased to help organize my cupboards. The mugs are huge and would require many pots of coffee when entertaining guest unless you want to fill them only part way. The ""bowls"" which can be ordered separately are designed to gorge if one was to actually fill them to capapcity.Not to mention, from what I have discovered during my research on the net, apparently they are quite easy to chip and are limited in thier safeness in the dishwasher and microwave (both on low heat settings) I love the look of them, but it is probably not one of my wiser investments."
2,the beauty fades fast,"These really are nice to look at, both in color and line. I'm a fan of Lenox overall, but I have to wonder what they were thinking, making a line that chips, crazes and cracks so easily and requires special handling in today's fast paced world. Perhaps they were thinking back to the day when people had butler's pantries and live-in help that could take the time to baby the tableware. Unfortunately, this line is not up to the wear and tear of the modern world. I'm just debating at this point how to sell off what I have left of Butler's Pantry that is still in good shape...which isn't anything I use daily."
4,Halfmast book review,"It was a good fast read, rather suspenseful especially towards the end. Good character development and an almost must read for any of us who have had to deal with bullies in grade school."
4,Solid Indie,"Good book--suspenseful and gratifying. A creepy take on the frustration and sense of helplessness that lead to tragedies like the Columbine High shootings. How refreshing to read a small-press book that's not only well written, but relatively typo free."
3,Good but where are the really great Chrispian songs?,"I think it such a pity that this talented singer and songwriter's only available CD contains hardly any of his best work. The real best of Chrispian St Peters is definately not on this CD. However, as this is the only available recording of Chrispian's work, do buy it. If you are a fan you will like it."
1,"Crispian ""One Hit"" St. Peters","For somebody who back in the day and really only had one major hit ""The Pied Piper"" to say he was better than Elvis & The Beatles, I think the guy bit off a little more than he could chew, no wonder he's a one hit wonder. I give it one star just because I like his one hit."
3,Music: Good. Engineering and Mix: Bad,"There is some great music on this CD, but the vibrance and brilliance of the music is lost and masked by the very poor quality of the engineering and mix. ""Pregon de Chocolate"" is a great hit that has been done by other artists (recently, Issac Delgado on is ""La Formula"" CD), and there are other great hits, too. But I am disappointed whenever I play it because of the way it was mixed."
4,Realizing Fred MacMurray,"I didn't see this movie until 2000. In fact every time I saw Fred MacMurray's name come up I avoided him. I always thought of him as a ""my three sons"" type of guy. This film all changed that in a big way and led me in search of other films with him in the lead roll. (i.e. ""Double Indemnity"")A love story set during WWII. The Japanese invade Singapore and the couple is separated for years. Stolen jewels, crooked police etc. etc. I won't spoil the plot and more than that. Cool film noir-ish( not quite a film noir in my humble opinion) script which was somewhat typical in 1947. Nice plot and some really nice filming technics. An underrated film (also my humble opinion) Where's the DVD? I'll be one of the first to pick it up."
5,Excellent for training horses and riders,"This is the best book in my library. I've had it a for a few years and have used it on several horses - one of whom refused to go on the bit for over two years before using this training method. It is clear, concise,and every step make sense and builds on the last. He gives examples and reasons for his methods and they make good common sense. It is invaluable as a tool for creating a strong foundation for a horse and even a rider's training (too often the two are considered seperate topics). I cannot recommend this book strongly enough."
3,Soul Sound - Sugababes,"UK CD Maxi Single Track Listing for -""SOUL SOUND"" - SUGABABES1) Soulchild Remix - 5:002) Medway City Heights Remix - 7:293) Joey Negro Club Mix - 7:022001"
2,Jungle King / Noah's Ark,"I bought this movie solely due to the inclusion within the DVD of a Noah's Ark cartoon.The animation of both cartoons was less than fine, and once the music sung by the lead characters start to kick in, that's when it's about time to plug your ears. On the other hand, youngsters at around 4 and under shouldn't have much a problem with it.On the plus side, from a creationist standpoint, is that different from other films in the same category of Noah's Ark, the scenery isn't all desert terrain, which is certainly a good thing!Overall, irregardless, if you are looking for a masterpiece in animation, this is certainly not it."
4,Funky Bass-Guitar Music,"A expensive CD (Japan-Import) from 1997, but if you like funky music like in the mid-80th's, you like this CD. A mix of funky sounds with a hard beat with Larry's bass guitar and soulful ballads. Very wonderful: The ballad ""Far Away Places"". A better groove as in his CD ""Fired Up"" from 1985."
4,Larry&GCS are happening,i dig the overall vibe of this set.solid grooves&laidback vibe.Larry Graham is a Musical Genius he shines on this set.this is a little Pricy but worth seeking out.alot of Thumping going on.
3,Satisfactory,"Presently, I am satisfied with this product. I did find a variance from one to the other. One operated more smoothly and with more pressure thana second one. Why? I don't know. Both will serve my need, so I amsatisfied."
2,Less than impressed,"Dad used this product to clean the house last summer. The nozzle didn't fit properly, although it's advertised as a universal fit. Also, the cleaning product reservoir leaked. Not a keeper. :("
4,Nice quality that makes cool cakes.,Good quality non-stick pan. The filling or pastry injector if you will is very small/narrow and hard to clean is my only constructive criticism.
4,It is fun to make home made twinkies - especially healthier vegan ones!,"It is handy to have a baking pan that makes little twinkie shaped cakes.This is the recipe I used for the cream filling - the barley malt definitely worksto give it a creamy taste and texture, and I'll keep tweaking this recipe.1/4 cup non-hydrogenated shortening1/4 cup non-hydrogenated margarine1 cup powdered sugar1 tsp. vanilla extract2 TB barley malt powder"
4,Surprisingly not a unitasker,"I bought this pan to make my own oil-free vegan corn dogs. My second use for the pan was with some of the (vegan oil-free) carrot cake recipe I was making; it was such a great idea and they popped right out, no oil spray or parchment paper necessary. The only time it stuck was when I made a chocolate cake recipe and baked fresh blueberries into the centers; there wasn't enough cake mix and the blueberries burst/leaked and make the ""twinkies"" stick a little. I tried out the decorating kit just once, to try and fill a carrot cake twinkie, and it worked neither too badly nor too well. It definitely seems like it was an afterthought when they came up with the twinkie pan idea and could be designed better. The only flaw with the pan is that it only makes 8 pieces. You could split your cake mix into 8 twinkies and 6 cupcakes, or 4 twinkies and one medium-height loaf-pan cake."
5,twinkies? corn dogs? pigs in a blanket?,I waited too long to purchase this! Now that I have these pans (I bought 2) my imagination has cut loose... The little injector gadget is not the best quality but it works well for soft fillings in the little cakes. The best concoction I've come up with so far has been wrapping a (fully cooked) smoked bratwurst half with a bit of pepper jack cheese in biscuit dough... push it seam side down in the canoe cavity then bake for about 12 min at 350. They bake up and shape perfectly. Make a dip with 50:50 medium chunky salsa : thick ranch dressing - a little greenage on the side and a cup o' moo juice - we are good to go... YUM!
1,no-stick pan is sticking!!,"I just wanted to ask someone what to use on the Norpro canoe cake pan so that the ""twinkies"" don't stick. I am having an awful time."
3,Twinkie pan,"The pan was not quite as deep as I thought would be, so Twinkies were smaller than would have liked.My biggest complaint is the pan sticks even if you spray it lightly.Even with the sticking problem I will still use it, as they are so good and my grandbabys think this is pretty neat."
5,My preferred Greek language course,I have found both Greek I and Greek II to be essential in helping me to progress with my Greek language studies. I started learning Greek over 18 months ago with the 30 lessons contained in Greek I.I used the Pimsleur courses as the main core of my Greek studies and have supplemented this with material from other sources including: Language Addicts; the Hellenic American Union and Survival Phrases to name but a few.The Pimsleur method allowed me to learn quickly and naturally in the same way we learn our mother tongue. Essential grammar is dealt with only where necessary using examples. I found that the repetition of key phrases from previous lessons helped me to firmly imprint the content in my brain!I have now completed and revised both Greek I and II but sadly there is no Greek III as yet.I would recommend the Pimsleur Greek course for anyone who wishes to learn to speak Greek as it can be used virtually anywhere whenever you have a spare few minutes.
2,not for people who type alot,"I got the skin for my Treo 750. The sleek skin is cute and is put on very easily. the only problem is i type alot on the keyboard and i couldn't type very easily at all. the skin goes around the keyboard making it impossible to hit the space bar and any buttons near the skin (the Q,A, P, backspace, Enter). This is because the skin kinda bulges out above these keys and is raised so high it's very uncomfortable to type. I keep hitting the sleek skin instead of the outer keys on my keyboard. unfortunately it's useless and i took it right off. MAYBE this is due to the fact that i do not have short nails (they're not that long) so if you have nails you won't be able to type on your treo with this thing on.Otherwise it fits well."
1,Would love to review,"Would love to write a review on this product. Would love to HAVE the product. Ordered 28 June from valuewatches, still waiting on it."
4,A fun soundtrack paying hommage to 60s spy music,"This is the soundtrack to the three part TV documentary series 'SpyTek' from The Discovery Channel, which premiered February 1998. Overall, a fun collection of newly written, 60s style spy music. Pays hommage to many spy music composers of that era. Includes an update of the classic James Bond Theme. Some of the tracks have a brief voice over at the beginning of Roger Moore's narration from the series. Also includes an unlisted track 20 with a brief one-liner from Roger Moore."
2,These cups are terrible,After doing extensive research we purchased 4 of training cups for our infant. They were very highly rated on multiple web sites. He was having difficulty drinking and becoming frustrated. I tried the cup myself and got mostly air and very little liquid. I respositioned the insert multiple times with no improvement. Thinking it was that particular cup we opened the others and tried them. About 1/3 of the time they actually work. The rest of the time you/the baby sucks mostly air. We purchased Gerber brand and a no name brand to see if they were any better. Sadly enough they were. We have used Dr. Brown bottles for the past 14 months. They are great. The training cups are absolutely awful.
1,"If I Could Give it a -10, I would!!","This cup was ruined after using it only 2 times! I'm glad that I discovered that the sucky piece tore before he choked on it!!! These are very expensive cups, and I would not recommend them to anyone! Big red caution flag on this item! This thing should be on some kind of recall list!!"
2,Dr. Brown's,"I used the Dr. Brown's bottles with my daughter who has a number of health issues, they were wonderful so I also had high expectations for the cup. I was sorely disappointed becuase they only last about a month before the spout has worn off from her constant drinking and the fact that she has teeth. She even choked on the rubber tip when it came off in her mouth. It is also absolutely not leak proof, it leaks anytime it isn't upright. I will not ever by this cup again."
4,Tony & Me,I have always enjoyed the work of these two men.. I also know what it's like to lose a best friend. The book was a treat and thoroughly enjoyable.
4,Happy with it,Pretty good. I like pretty much everything in it. The only problem is that the charge goes out within a day or two.
1,Nice try ... phone screen goes dead,"I bought the Razr phone about a year ago, and I liked it for the whole time. It was the right size, weight, form.My problems were:* Do not like that you cannot shut off all the beeps. If I get a call and do not answer it, it will beep every few minutes to remind me. This is hell in the middle of the night, you either have to put the phone far away, or answer it, or shut it off. What kind of an idiot designs something like this? I want to throw it across the room or stomp it when it does this.* The other problem is that the screen now has decided to go dead. I open the phone to make a call and aftera second of two it turns black. Then it may or may not intermittently light up again, but this is very irritating. I got the phone really cheap, but now if I replace it it will cost me a lot.Stay away from this POS even though it seems nice, and looks nice, it will cost you in irritation and you will have to buy a another one at full price at some point."
3,Love the phone but text messaging is a pain!,"I primarily use a cell phone for two things...talking on the phone and text messaging. This is my second Razr. I owned the first version Razr before this one. I like this phone a lot except for one thing which was also a problem with my first Razr (I was hoping they'd improved the problem but that doesn't seem to be the case). Does anyone else besides me have trouble with the keys during text messaging? The 7 and 9 keys are extremely difficult to depress when text messaging and often I find that those keys are skipped entirely in my messaging. I have to check and double check and often I have to depress the key several times, moving my finger around on the key to get it in just the right place (it seems that my finger needs to be on the extreme outside edge of those keys before they will work) before a letter shows up at all. THEN I have to get it on the correct letter. It's VERY frustrating! Anyone else have this trouble?"
4,nice phone indeed,"This is a nice phone. I upgraded from an old Nokia and like this one more. I was trying to locate the sensor mentioned in the other review but can't find it, even with the help of manual. The only red dot is the camera :)Reception is good for now (a month of use) and I think the battery life is good as well. Ring tones and arrangement of features are easily changed to your own liking. Camera if just fine with 8x zoom but the pictures look good only with using no zoom at all. But what else would one expect from an 1.3 mp mobile camera? Love the styling though, flat and wide, and I personally love this color."
3,Academic studies of sexual behavior of men.,"This book is an academic treatise, replete with references to research and to academic studies and documentation. It is fascinating, but primarily focused on sexual behavior and sexual deviance as well as violence and their treatment by the courts and by the medical profession during the years identified. I believe it may be of interest to those with an interest in the psychosocial/historical aspects of sexuality and men."
5,Great product. Why do you ask?,the CD is beautiful. I will respond to future feedback requests only if I am disattisfied with the product. Thanks.
2,disappointed....,i''m sure as chant music goes this is very good..... but it is just not my cup of tea. i expected something more outstanding.... like a church choir.
5,TOO FUNNY!!!!,"THIS IS TOO FUNNY, IN SOME RESPECTS IT IS SAD THAT IT SHOWS HOW CRAZY THE CAR BIZ REALLY IS. A MUST FOR ANYONE IN THE DEALERSHIP GAME!!!!"
5,Monster HTS 5100 ii signature,"It does great job for its purpose,cleaner sound and sharper picture is noticed right away.Looks great too."
5,A good book for Pre Algebra and fun to read,I wouldn't say it's the only math book you need but it has a lot math facts for student starting Algebra and for Grow ups to it's one of those around the house math books but kids well learn there math from this book
3,Good for the occasional reference,I don't use this book much but it is good for the occasional reference. I used it for the Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion when my baby was running a fever and the only thermometer I could find was Celsius.
4,The good and the bad,"Chris Stapleton's review is almost right. There are time when concentration seems to wane, but the sheer power and captivating quality of Busi's voice always draws you back. This is high on my list of favourite albums, but Urbanzulu ranks higher - check it out."
3,The lady doth protest too much,"While I had adjustments to make when I came into my 50's, this book didn't really help, as Pogrebin was far more freaked out than I was about aging, and seems to spend the book convincing herself that it's ok. I wasn't concerned with a lot of the superficial stuff with regard to aging... looks, weight, etc. So it was more the spiritual and existential aspects of life that interested me. But, even up to the end of the book, it sounded to me like a frantic effort to make herself comfortable with the aging process. Letty's mother-in-law (my nursery school teacher), Esther Pogrebin, was a true feminist who was always comfortable in her own skin and freaked out by very little - now, she could have written a terrific book on aging."
1,What is it?,"I never got it. It is Shania's mystery album. Released one day, out of stock the next. A word was never mentioned about it."
3,Westward! Hey! Wait a minute!,"Everybody's saying how great this is. To me, it doesn't sound like a real band is playing at all. It sounds like some really intelligent musician used a piano/midi/computer and composed nine cool tunes. #10 sounds like something on a Windham Hill sampler and #11 sounds like a Steve Tibetts piece-Hey I like WH and ST but this is supposed to be Aqua Velvets. There's no vocals and 2-3 seconds between each tune---sort of like a demo sent by some musician. Three stars because the music sounds cool; but after #10 and #11 I couldn't get into #12. I'm not buying anymore of this stuff.***COUGH**COUGH**"
5,Great Music for Cruising Around Town,"I first heard this group while listening to an internet radio station that was playing the track ""Surf Nouveau"". When I first heard that song I was blown away buy the sound and feel of the music. It made me feel like getting up and moving around. When I finally tracked down the CD and bought it, I was equally impressed by all of the tracks especially the one titled ""Return to Paia"". This track made me say ""Whoa"", this one makes you wish you were on a warm beach somewhere drinking somthing with one of those little umbrellas sticking out of it as you watch a beautiful island sunset. If you close your eyes and listen to this music it makes you feel really good.All I can say is you can't go wrong with this CD if you like modern surf inspired music. This is not straight Dick Dale or Ventures stuff for those of you who are only looking for that kind of music though."
5,Smooth and cool as an ocean breeze,"This the essential Aqua Velvets release. A little bit of Surf, The Ventures and Spaghetti Western combined is the best way I can describe this awesome set of guitar tracks. This is a great CD to pop in when your stuck in the beach house during a rain storm or while you're driving across the desert at dusk. Absolutely stunning set. I am listening to it as I write this, trying to find a negative, but I'm at a loss. The CD runs the gamut from surf rave ups like ""Holly Tiki"" and odd time signature pieces like ""Snorkle Mask Replica, to shimmering guitar pop on ""Summer at Dreampoint"" and nods to Ennio Morricone on ""Return to Paia"". What a great album!"
2,The Patient Nurse,"I love Diana Palmer; however, this was as disappointment. I felt there wasn't an even amount of tension, angst, and reconciliation. There was too much anger/cruelty toward the heroine from the hero/family. I felt so bad for the heroine that by the end of the book when they finally got together, I was exhausted. The entire family/hero treated her so bad that it was depressing."
3,Quick read,"Traditional Diana Palmer plot. Good, quick read. Promotes moralistic read.morals. No sex until they're married at the end.Would recommend"
1,Fellow travelers beware: this video wastes your time,"I like to review travel videos of places to which I'm contemplating traveling, and there are many good ones out there. But this video, my friends, is not helpful. I don't know if it's inexperience or bad instruction, but the stilted dialogue between the guide and the people she interacts with is painful to witness. I would have liked to have seen more of the countryside, and less bad French hip-hopping. The guide even makes a glib comment about how arrogant the French are toward you if you don't speak the language. Seemingly, the entire production crew has never traveled there if they allow tripe like that to remain in the film. Though there's nothing on the packaging to indicate it, perhaps this video is targeted at 20-something travelers. But that's no excuse for the high-school production end result. If you want to wallow in this video's awfulness, rent it at the library...but don't pay money for it!"
4,"Great Rapper, Great Music","I'm a big fan of Pumpkin Head and this release only solidifies that further. This c.d. is pretty top notch and a nice underground release. Brooklyn Academy, the cut with Immortal Technique and Metaphor is absolutely crack (also found on a few of Immortal's releases.) All of the tracks are solid. The best is definitely Blacklisted, followed closely by Park Slope. The only track the falters from my perspective is Mujar Triste were the beat is a little ""different."" Not my style you might like it though. Also really short 7 tracks, however all are put to good use. This is a definite pick-up for every underground head or fan of pure hip-hop. 1111111."
3,One of the Best,Ok first off the reason i gave it a 3 is i have yet to see it. I'm mainly posting because it is the only one. Like others i have some i would like to se. The episode where anthony Zerbe tells mccall about his daughter. Then there is the ultimate lansing/woodward episode where Contoll goes on trial i beleve by the company. I dont know if it was reall or a ploy but i know it was a great one :).The third and one that most impacted me during the original run was the one about a hitman who towards the end impersonates a blind priest. I saw that when i was about 10 LOL and amn that epsode and the episode where mccall stops a black kid from taking a life so he wont be haunted are the top 4 i would like to see come out on video =)
5,McCall on DVD is a Must !,This was a great series and this is a fine episide. If you want to get a feel for the series try this story;it will hep you understand McCall's past. I'd love to see this show on DVD!!!
4,extra Equalizer episodes available....,"For many years I am a huge fan of The Equalizer series, but unfortunadly they do not run in Europe anymore for some years.I have bought this video several years ago and I still enjoy watching it. This video is a release of a 2 episodes serie, and it is very good I have to atmitt.Fore years I was looking for new releases of The Equalizer in many countries, but nothing was released untill today.I was excited to find a 3 video box with 9 episodes of The Equalizer last week in London. It says volume 1 so there will be more released very soon I hope.The box is a compilation of the series over 3 years of broadcasting, which includes the Pilot episode and some other good episodes.It is enjoying to see Edward Woodward in new episodes after so many years and lisytening to the beautifull music of Stewart Copeland.The video can be purchased via the Internet but I found my copy at the Virgin store.Unfortunadly Amazon.com has not included it into their product list so far."
3,NOT BAD BUT ...,"Not bad, but there are much better episodes that could have been released. Please release more! This is one of the last of the best TV shows that was really original. They don't make them like this any more."
3,not good for swing dancing,"I bought this book because my husband and I were taking dancing classes and were learning swing dance. I thought this would provide us with an entire album of practice music. However, the performances on this CD do not provide a steady rhythm throughout each song: there are places where they interpretatively slow down the rhythm. This makes dancing difficult."
5,A Great Overview of the Four Main Eschatological Positions,"Clouse does a superior job of putting together 4 scholarly advocates of different millennial interpretations. Ladd, Hoekema, and Hoyt do an excellent job of presenting and defending their stances, while Boettner's essay on Postmillennialsim could have been better. Consequently, the rebuttals from each of the other essayists concerning this view were comparitively disappointing as well.Overall, this book really is a must have for any person wanting exposure to the options in Christianity concerning the 1000 year reign of Christ as described in Rev. 20."
2,Too big a subject for short arguments....,"The authors of this book have limited time to fully make and defend thier argument. As a result, each author assumes you understand the basic premise of each argument and never fully explains the scope of what they are trying to defend. In turn, there are many facets of each view the authors never address. I bought this book due to the fact that I am a long term fan of GE Ladd, however, he also fails to make a strong case. I would recommend as an alternative reading books on each individual subject by each author where they have time to formulate a formidable argument for their case and address the problems with their view."
2,Doesn't really introduce you to its charm and uniqueness,"This video is funny to watch, but seems to gloss over what makes this region so unique. Oaxaca in particular has a depth of cultural, artistic and architectural heritage that deserved a more thorough coverage than in this one."
5,Inflammation of the foreskin reminds me of your smile. . . .,"This is a book for every Monty Python fan out there! It is really excellent, and includes almost all the songs, excluding a few of the lesser ones like ""Sgnt Duckie's Song"" and ""The Window Cleaner Song"" but just about everything else is in there. Admittedly, it's a bit annoying about some of the music being illigeble, such as ""Eric the Half A Bee"" appearing in a sphere shape, and ""Bing Tiddle Tiddle Bong"" being flipped totally around. However, it's still a great book, and the foreword, afterword, and middleword by Elvis and God are very funny. There's nothing better than to sit down at the piano sometimes and just play magnificent songs like ""I've got a Ferret sticking up my nose..."" This is a super book!"
1,THE LAST FART,THIS DVD IS A RIP-OFF. THREE AND ONE HALF MINUTES OF BLACK AND WHITE BOREDOM. NOT FUNNY. ZERO STARS IS MY RATING BUT NOT AN OPTION.
5,Merveilleux!,"Imagine Fiona Apple meets Damien Rice in vintage Cannes. Rich acoustics, satisfying sounds, and poetic French vocals. For me this CD is not just a keeper but a 'play until the tracks are worn right off the disc. Then buy another.' [Mrs. Readwell's recommendation: Allons-y! We must buy! Buy!]"
4,Simple but grand,"I fell upon this CD after hearing one song from Camille's more recent album and I loved it. Not the typical music that usually listen too but some songs are just undeniably great. I admit there are some songs that I haven't even grown to love or listen too but tracks 3,5,6,7 and of course the amazing finale ""La ou je suis nee""... I can simply keep that song on repeat.The album is mostly vocal with some tracks having great instrumentals, Camille loves to plays with her voice and we love her for that.The lyrics are quite simple, but damn smart with a lot of emotions just under the surface.If you feel like something different and trying something new... take a chance on Camille either this album or ""Le fil"" the newer one and you at least be intrigued."
2,"okay but not as good as ""Le Fil""","I really like her album ""Le Fil"" and this album didn't measure up to my expectations. She has talent but this one didn't suit my tastes. It was okay but not great."
3,"Nice cream, but you can get the same OTC","This hand cream is fine, but you can save yourself the money and wait by going to walmart and getting Udderly smooth, has about the same consistency, lasting power and moisture retention. wouldn't purchase again"
5,"nimrod, your the greatest","this green day cd is loud, fast, and up tempo...in a good way. pretty much all of the songs rock except for maybe one or two and the bonus track is really cool. my favorite song would have to be Platypus(i hate you) because it is up and in your face the entire time. on most of the songs on this album, you can see the more punkish side of green day that they have been hiding since kerplunk and it is much better than before. another popular song from this album is good riddence(time of your life) and billy goes acoustic with a violin, no druming and no bass. it is very melodic. another favorite song of mine is the funny King For A Day. it sounds kinda ska ish and i like how it goes. worry rock, jinx, nice guys finish last, and haushinka are powerfull and have a good beat and some mad guitar riffs. if you want to buy a green day album, this is the one to pickP.S. i like where this is going by stevo"
3,Should be more durable,"I like the WOLF Garten products and have bought many of them. With only one handle needed for mutiple snap on tools, great for space saving. However I realized today that this trowel can not stand up to the marine clay we have here in the DC Metro, it began to bend. These products are ideal for small light loam gardens and yards in Europe, but are far from professional grade. I was disappointed, but for green house use, garden boxes, or elderly gardeners these are fantastic products."
5,WOLF-garten Tools,I love every WOLF-garten tool I've purchased from Amazon. I've recently added the trowel. I've thrown away so many cheaply made tools but it's obvious the WOLF-garten tools will last as long as I'm gardening. The interchangeable handles make every tool a versatile implement for all my garden needs.
2,"Small, attach to short handle only",This trowel has the size of small trowel. The interchange locking is only worked with short handle because you don't want to attach a trowel with the size of your palm to a long handle. It looks ridiculous and not effective. Buy this the same size trowel at a lower price at your local stores.
3,Matchbook size boxes.,"The boxes are matchbook size with just a few candies in each. It is exactly as pictured, but without a good perspective can be misleading as to how small the sample boxes actually are. If I had seen this in the store for the same price, I would not have purchase it."
4,Chocolatey Goodness from Japan,"These are another neat taste experience from japan. The chocobabies, however, contain shellac as an ingredient, which kinda turned me off to them when I learned about it. The stars in this set are the strawberry-chocolate cone things, whatever they're called. They're delicious! Also, the coffee flavored ones are excellent. I'm finding I am a fan of just about anything made by Meiji, and this set is no exception."
2,"Good Flavors, But Definitely Not Worth The Price!","I don't know what was worse, the packaging, the amount of time it took for me to receive this item, or the ridiculous pricing tacked onto such tiny boxes. They couldn't have been more than an inch thick, each. All of the flavors were unique and delicious, but reminded me greatly of M&M;'s, so I could not enjoy them like I might have if I'd gotten them at a price more deserving.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your cash on this tiny treat! Heed my words!"
4,"Hahaha, cute.","The size was quite small indeed for the candy, but still we enjoyed them. :)Next time I will buy them in a larger quantities. XD"
4,Electric Mood Music,"Finally, a worthy companion piece to 'Escape From Television'. Half of these songs are lovely dreamscapes from 'Miami Vice'. The rest are taken from some cheesy European cop show, and they are somewhat bland. But I'd go through perdition's flames to track down Hammer's 'Miami Vice' music. A great buy."
2,Warped.,When the blade came I mounted it on my Delta compound miter saw and even before I made a cut I noted that the blade wobbled when I took it up to speed. Double checked that there was no problem with the mounting of the blade and still found a noticible wobble. Sent it back to Amazon and replaced it with an 80T Bosch for a few dollars more. That one shows no wobble. I guess there is a reason Irwin blades cost a little less.
4,rhubarb filling,"this is yummy, easy and unusual. it makes a quick, delicous pie, crisp or cobbler. home made is better, but a heck of a lot more work. this is great to have on hand for last minute dessert needs where you really want to impress wih your creativity in cooking! recommended."
3,I was robbed,"Pro:The product was great, made great pies, even better spead over the top of ice cream.Con:The shipping cost more than the product. I ordered 4 jars and it cost $40 to ship to Hawaii. I could have gone to the post office and shipped it for a 3rd of that price. The shipping cost was not posted until my order was finalized so I didn't know how much they were going to charge until it was too late."
4,Very Good Rhubarb Pie Filling,"I was raised in Michigan and had fresh rhubarb pie on a regular basis. This particular recipe is pretty good, and makes a very good pie. I could of course compare it to my grandmother's pie and be critical, but instead just say that if you have not had rhubarb pie in a while, or never had it, this is one of the best and easiestways to re-introduce or introduce you to this wonderful pie. My wife called Barry Farm prior to cooking the pie, and they were very nice and helpful with cooking and serving hints.Good filling, great customer service! You'll love your pie."
4,Rhubarb pie filling,"Product was packed very well and arrived in good time. Wish it had not been quite so jell-filled, but was really pleased overall."
2,OK but...,There is something substantial missing in all Globe Trekker series. You never ever get to see the beauties of a city but always how cheap you can sleep in the most disgusting places and how much harder you can suffer while traveling. I do have a lot of respect for Ian Wright but some times I feel he is just a clown!
2,What happened?,"I have used the other levels in this series and have been satisfied. I like the choice of words and the structure of the lessons. The problem with this book is that there are words that are nearly synonymous with each other, and the way that the exercises are worded and the answer choices are very confusing. Compared to the other levels in this series, level E is by far the weakest. Disappointing."
5,Orly Nails For Males .60 oz.,"excellent product, arrived on time, works great. i would purchase from this merchant again.very happy with this product, would recommend it to friends."
4,Christmas present,"My daughter said she liked it, Very pretty and mine did look like the picture. I did think the price was a little high."
3,"Mixed results, as usual","Some really catchy stuff here, but also some songs that I can't remember after hearing. This is a gripe I have about all their albums. Still, like all their albums, it repays repeated listenings. I put this one and their last 3 CD's in my player and hit random. It made the new stuff stand out. Try it!"
3,Big Red Letter Day. . . Sleepy Eyed...etc.,"The new album Smitten is basically the same old Tom, just more of it. If you really liked the previous two recordings, this is more of those goodies..."
5,A wonderful last fling,"I'm disappointed by the negative reactions I've read to this wonderful album, which sadly turned out to be the group's swansong. Having seen them live back in 1996, when they were loud, tight and terrific, I saw the scope for stretching out that was fulfilled in their subsequent albums. ""Smitten"" shows a new depth in their songwriting (albeit tinged with melancholy) and Bill Janovitz has seldom been in finer voice, especially on ""Postcard"" and ""Scottish Windows"". The band's rockier side is not neglected; witness ""White Paint Morning"" and the broody ""Knot In It"", and Chris Colbourn chips in with some typical irony in ""Rachael"" and ""The Bible"".Like all Buffalo Tom's work, repeated listening is rewarded. They remain one of the great underrated groups of the 1990s and I miss them sorely."
3,La Princessa De La Salsa........still holds true!,"Altough this may not be a typical salsa album, it is definatley one of my favorite India releases since ""Sola"". Her voice sounds incredibly strong as it seems to get better with age and experience. Standout tracks are ""Que Me Importa"" and ""El Hombre Perfecto"". The orchestration is tight and the production is good. Hopefully for her next album she will do a straight up salsa record. There will never be another Celia Cruz, but La India stands a good chance of keeping the fire burning."
5,India and Celines are the two Puertorican Divas,"I buy this album and the new release HISTERIHA of the puertorican Diva CELINES. This two puertorican Divas are fabulous. Her voices, talent and all of both are glorious. Really, if you like to expend your money in real good music buy this two productions: Histeriha from Celines and Latin Songbird: Mi Alma Y Corazon from India."
3,brow pencil breaks when you sharpen it,Every time I sharpened this pencil the product broke off in the sharpener. It doesn't sharpen well at all! I love the way it goes on my eyebrows I choose the blonde color pencil. Too bad it doesn't last after the first sharpening. It is a waste of money.
1,Very poor sound quality!,This cd is like a low quality mp3. I can't stand listening to it. It gives me a headache within five minutes. They should burn all of these cd's and find the original recording tapes and remaster them properly.
2,Not enough of their non-hits that are still great songs,"I was hoping to make do with a ""best of"" Three Dog Night, purchasing this CD so that I wouldn't have to replace all of my vinyl. But this is sadly lacking; an incomplete ""complete hits"" collection. I miss ""Pieces of April"" ""My old Kentucky Home"" and other of the lesser knowns (still hits in my book) from their old albums. Also, not sure if the equipment on which I played it was off, but I didn't like the mix I got--the balance of high-midrange was too heavy and I wanted the crisp kick from a good treble and bass peak. Still its good to have around just for refreshing me on the lyrics during my alone-time sing-alongs at the top of my lungs. Just want better ""back up."""
5,Three Dog Night !!,Saw this CD and had to have it...took me back to the 70's when music was music...no screaming or cussing...just good songs about life and stuff!
3,Weird Mixes,I guess I'm used to the original mixes. These sound kind of odd. My head is stuck in mono mode in my memory for lots of their songs
4,Good CD,"Hadn't heard any Three Dog Night in a while, and I'm carrying this CD around with me in the car so I can listen to it while I'm out and about. Good to hear them again."
4,3 dog night,"liked band as kid, thought i would buy this cd and put on my ipod so i can remember the good old days"
2,"I love the CD but am disappointed because at Track 10, 11 & 12 it skips! Can I get a new one please!","The CD came fast which was good. I played it for the first time this weekend and am disappointed because it skips in Track 10, 11 and 12. I need a replacement."
4,Three Dog Night's Most Complete Collection On One CD!,"Being a huge Three Dog Night fan when I saw this new collection by the band I had to have it. Three Dog Night were the biggest act in the late 60's/early seventies, I saw them twice back then and they were awesome. I love this collection and while the sound quality is better, atleast on the stereo recordings, due to remastering, quite a few of the songs are in mono only. Certainly the stereo versions must be available and in my opinion are the superior. Just listen to the disc in headphones and you'll see why stereo is better. In the headphones ""The Family Of Man"" sound terrible in mono. ""Pices Of April"" (also in mono) loses much of keyboardist Jimmy Greenspoon's beautiful melodies. How the other reviewer can think mono is better is odd. A good collection, but is hurt by mono recordings."
5,QUESTIONS ABOUT MONO AND LINER NOTES,One of the reviews stated that six of the songs are in mono. Which six? Do the liner notes include the recording dates for each song? Feel free to email me at Shawboy@webtv.net
4,Still as good as when they were young,"I got to see them June 15th 2007 at the Saratoga Winery. They were a blast!!! You thought it was yesterday. They still got it, they still sound as good. They took ""Momma Told Me Not To Come"" and turned it into a Rap for fun, and the way they did it, you would have thought it had alwasy been sung that way.I found myself remembering the words to most of the songs, that I thought I had forgotten. You don't forget, the words are just tucked away. They had a couple of new band members but the rest were the good ol' guys we remember. If you don't get to see them, this CD will be the next best thing. You will really enjoy listening to the songs on this CD.After buying this, go check out ""ToTo"". They were the opening Band for Three Dog Night!!!"
5,Absolutely Great!,"Simply put, this is the absolute best of Three Dog Night. This Singles collection shows the band's diversity, versatility and energy. If you are interested in finding out what their popularity was all about or if you've been wanting the singles versions on cd, this album is for you. When originally released on 45rpm records, some of the singles were different from their lp versions. For example: Eli's Coming, Liar, Joy To The World and Old Fashioned Love Song. As a fan, I always thought that the singles were better than their lp versions and that's what I love about this album. The Hits are here! Also, the sound is excellent and the chronological order of the recordings with liner notes give a nice historical overview of one of the world's greatest rock bands."
4,This is a SINGLES collection,"In response to the many who have written complaining about the mono versions 6 songs...these are the single versions of the songs, hence the title ""Complete Hit SINGLES""! The LP versions were in stereo and had many differences in the mix (Joy To the World has several different edits). That being said, if you want all the hits and all the hit versions, this is by far the best collection on one disc. I would rather have these mono versions since these are the ones I grew up with on AM radio. Plus the sound is fabulous."
4,Memories,"There were many songs that I did not know Three Dog Night recorded. However, the hits that I knew sounded like they were on vinyl and on the radio. If you like Three Dog Night, this CD might be for you."
2,Poor storage of item!,"Upon recieving item, I noticed that the outside cover to the vinyl was extremly warpped. The plastic wrap around the cover must have shrinked due to heat. The vinyl is slightly warpped but still playable."
4,An awesome blend of punk and ska with great lyrics.,"I bought this album not ever hearing the band before and I loved it. It goes from some fast songs to some layed back tunes with some of the best lyrics I've ever heard. And for those bass players out there, listen to Zac on the bass. He's one of the best."
3,Singer of all Songs,"A bit predictable, but a nice book to read during class when the teacher's lecturing about something boring."
4,A spectacular entry,"Constable has made a fully realized fantasy world. Tremaris spans a globe, and is home to many types of people, all wonderfully diverse and vividly described. She does the same for her settings: lush descriptions and clever figurative language spare no color on this world. It's a beautiful place.Calwyn is a wonderful heroine: idealistic, strong-willed, yet she knows of her own weaknesses at times. I had a brilliant time imagining her voice as she sang (Personally, I am a Japanese-pop music fan, and the opening theme of Record of Lodoss War became a sort of anthem in my head for Calwyn's voice). I really do recommend busting out your foreign language tracks (OH what a candidate for a book with a soundtrack!)The supporting cast is well fleshed out with physically and emotionally differing characters, as well. From Darrow to Mica, everyone is their own.Anyone who is a fan of fantasy should read this book. It will leave you impatient for the next in the trilogy."
3,Enjoyable young adult fantasy,"Probably 3.5 stars. A young singer of ice songs finds an injured mage and leaves her land to help him save the world. A well-written and light book that was enjoyable to read. I thought the world itself, the chantments and other aspects of the environment were well done. The writing is engaging and the pace is very quick. The ending was a little predictable but still good and I look forward to the next book by this author."
5,BEST BOOK EVER,This is my favorite book of all time!!! I first read it when I was 14 way back in 2004 and I fell in love with it. I've never read a book more than once but I have read this one 4 times and it never gets old. It's such a wonderful story and adventure; I tell all my friends to read it because it is fantastic! Not only is the storyline great and exciting but Kate Constable is a wonderful writer. She really knows what she is doing and makes you feel like you are in the story! It's definitely worth the buy!
4,Great Teen Read,I bought this for my very independent 13-yr.-old. She ate it up! A successful birthday gift. Mom is happy.
3,The Singer of All Songs,"One of my friends told me that this was one of the best books she's ever read, but I'd definitely have to disagree. This was just an average, okay book. It definitely had some interesting qualities, like Calwyn's strong feelings for Darrow and an ending that would leave most people wondering about what could happen. But I just think that the whole story was a bit predictable and it seemed to drag on forever... Then again, I'm very selective about what types of fantasy books I like and dislike."
4,Thought,At first when I picked up this book I was just looking for someting to keep me occupied during one of my classes but as soon as I started to read it I couldnt stop.This book is good for people who can follow a mysterie and enjoy unknown lands and people. A must read and I can't wait to read the 2nd instalment in the Chanters of Tremaris Trilogy
5,Eisbrecher sind kalt!!!,"Finally the arrival of Eisbrecher's ""Mein Blut (MCD)"". Being a fan of industrial/EBM/SynthPop I found that this album very, very acceptable. Although it only has the one song on it, the remixes provide enough variety for any EBM fan. Alexx and Noel have created a wonderful sound. The Carlos Perón Remix should be played in every Goth/Industrial/EBM club! I think if Eisbrecher keep this sound up they can make it very big in the EBM world. I recommend this to anyone that loves EBM/Industrial/SynthPop. Eisbrecher sind kalt!!!"
4,Great movie.,"I have to agree with the first review; the ""professional critic""'s review WAS way off. Lloyd IS what every kid feels like; goofy, un-cool, and heartbreakingly in love. And Tom Arnold... Wow. I fell in love with the man because of his performance in this movie. Wish he would have been in it more. If you let your kids watch the Disney Channel, you should have absolutely no problem letting them watch Lloyd. It's entertaining, funny, and if you say you can't relate to it...you're LYING!! :o)"
2,Not for adults; teenage/preteen humor,My kids (19 & 16)loved this dvd. I personally thought that I'd rather do yardwork than sit through it again. It was not the kind of humor I enjoy but they laughed til they cried.
4,Lloyd,"I've never written a review before, but after reading the Editor's comments, I had to reply. I don't know if the reviewer is come kind of extreme, obsessive, political correctness zealot, but my family, which includes 8 and 10 year old girls, really enjoyed this movie. It was funny, and in many ways true to life. True, a couple of the sceens with the bully showed him as mean spirited, but that's life. This actually gave me a great opportunity to discuss this type of behavior with my children and discuss how to best avoid and/or deal with it. Unfortunately, in the real world, things like this actually happen. Very enjoyable movie, definitely recommended."
3,ABOVE AVERAGE COMING OF AGE FILM! 3 1/2 STARS!,"I never heard of this film before I watched this film and it was better than I expected it to be. 'Lloyd' is a geeky kid who is not popular at school. This family friendly coming of age film has a few surprises, but it's not a as deep as I would have liked. It is however a decent movie with it's share of good laughs! The cast give it their all in this cute little film about square pegs trying to fit into a round hole."
5,The Miracle of the Bells,"Undoubtedly one the finest performances by Fred MacMurry and Frank Sinatra, not to mention the superior supporting cast, Lee J. Cobb for starters. But because Sinatra isn't singing the ""experts""; Maltin, Siskel, Ebert and Shalate overlook his REAL acting abiltiy. Sinatra is as pure a thespian as Olivier in this role as a priest (not even a church hymn from Frank's lips is hummed). Maltin's above review includes ""ludicrous"" plot-I'm sure the movie GHOST is on Leonard's his TOP 100 list. Trust no critic: see the this inspirational movie at once."
5,"Corny, but sweet - I like it",I couldn't wait to buy this on DVD. I saw it when I was a child and again a few years ago on AMC (when it was still worth watching).I can't believe the bad reviews it got. It's a very sweet film.
2,A Feel-Bad Christmas Movie,"The first time I saw ""The Miracle of the Bells"" was a New Year's Eve party in 1980, and man, it was a bring down. Here is a somewhat nasty Fred MacMurray mourning the loss of Valli (from ""The Third Man""), who had only just completed filming her Joan of Arc movie, the movie that would have catapulted this obscure nobody into a major star, it seems, but fate would have it otherwise, since she up and died. Frank Sinatra plays against type big time as a gentle young priest. I really disliked this movie, and I bet you would too."
4,Great Customer Service,"Although I was very disheartened that the tape I purchased didn't work, I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly the merchant responded to my email inquiry about the problem (literally within an hour). This was a new tape, so there was no way that he could have known that the tape was defective, but he promptly accepted the return of the video - even providing confirmation of receipt and a verification that there was a problem with the tape. I wish all issues were resolved this efficiently. I will not hesitate to do buisness with this merchant again."
3,"kinda silly, kinda nice","One theme of this movie is the importance of becoming a movie star. Contrary to one review below, Sinatra does sing in this movie--and tries to act, too (he's pretty wooden, in my own humble opinion). The contention in the movie that the entire American nation would hysterically mourn the loss of an actress they'd never met, seen, or heard of, is, in a word, hysterical. But, all that said, this is a kinda fun movie to watch. VALLI is MAGNIFICENT! She should have played Joan of Arc--watch the movie and you'll see why. I've heard rumors that the film will be re-made with Tom Hanks as the actor and Meg Ryan as the agent!"
3,Basic protection at a lower price.,"I wasn't that pleased with this case's fit on myPod 30. I have found this case is a little too big for the 30 -- in addition to the included plastic spacer, it required inserting a thick slice of cardboard behind the iPod to fill up the slack. The clear plastic window cover protects the iPod's screen, but is too easily scratched (Speck did send me a replacement, however). No instructions or diagrams were included in the package I received. On the plus side, the soft ruobber cover provides effective shock protection from bounces and drops. It's very basic protection at a lower price."
1,Brand new and only worked twice.,The blender burned up on the second time it was turned on. I have sent it back and hoping the new one will work much better. I will be letting you know.
4,Made me LOTS of $$,"I was first given one of these for my Coffee Shop, then I asked to borrow a second. I was making in excess of 150 drinks a night with these units, on Friday and Saturday nights. Never a problem with them. They kept up WELL. Made drinks in less than 45 seconds. Crushed ice faster than anything I've ever seen. The bottom of the pitcher (the plastic thing that screws to the bottom of the pitcher that holds the blade and washer) cracked from over tightening. Needs to be replaced. Cannot find one, so I came here to finally buy one for myself. The price is so reasonable, the heck with getting parts for the other one. You cannot go wrong with this unit. I had to return the other one to a friend, hated to do it."
2,Disappointing,"When I first pulled this out of my old dorm room supplies I was enthusiastic. It has a very nice, clean design. However, I was sorely disappointed when I tried to use it to make smothies with ice. It is VERY DIFFICULT TO GET IT TO CHOP ICE (it doesn't suck the ice to the bottom well). Go for something else. This model is inadequate. I'm looking for a new machine."
5,Great fun.,"Zahn has really captured the Star Wars galaxy and made it fun. He suceeds in pace and excitement where Barbara Hambly failed. His villain, Thrawn was the most interesting adversary to our heroes since Vader died. Jade, Karde and C'Boath added more memorable characters to the Star Wars Galaxy."
3,"Great book, but very hard to believe","I think this is a good STAR WARS book, but has slow patches in the story which sometimes make reading it unbearable. I love STAR WARS, but this one will never be as good as The Courtship of Princess Leia."
4,"Very exciting, but still not romantic enough!","This book was as exciting as the first one, but once again had the same problem! No kissing, only one hug, practically nothing. It was very good, but it really does need at least a few kisses. I mean, come on, they're married!"
3,ok,"the thrawn trilogy is ok at best and really overrated. the writing style really hurts the books and takes away from the good story and interesting characters. we don't really need to be informed every time someone has to 'connect to the force', or runs through jedi meditation techniques, etc. it has to be implied at some point really."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Grand Admiral Thrawn attacks the New Republic on many fronts. He forcesour intrepid band of heroes to flee assassins, and Leia takes off withChewie, and Han goes looking for help by himself.The dodgy Mara Jade is also floating around, as is a not so nice Jedi Master.Whoever controls the 'Dark Force' of ancient ships in the end will have a massive advantage in the battle for the galaxy."
3,Politics & Diplomacy Are A Little Too Much In This One.,"Dark Force Rising is my second Star Wars novel I have read (aside from the film novelizations).I found it less exciting than Heir To The Empire, but it won't stop me from readin the next in the series The Last Command.Throughout the novel I found too much diplomacy and politics. I was intrigues by them in the first novel, but in this one it starts to become too much. Where Heir to The Empire contained a good mix of action and intrugue mixed in, Dark Force Rising does not. Only a few scenes in the entire novel have any real non political conflict. The ending won me over though and I will start the next one today!"
2,Unnecessary,"The Thrawn trilogy could easily have been condensed into two, even one book. The trilogy, this book especially, is full of needless material that is not constructive or useful to the plot, character development, or quality of the book. The characters are inaccurate and...stupid. I started reading the trilogy with high hopes, and I was seriously disappointed. A MUCH better Star Wars book: The Truce at Bakura-or The Courtship of Princess Leia"
5,Great Book,This book rocks. The space battle at the end kicked butt. Also the twist at the end was a surprise.
4,This should be a movie,This book is a terrific story read the whole trilogy its terrific they need to make it a movie
3,Had Its Moments,I found this book a little more drawn out then the first. In keeping with the first book I found myself putting it down shortly after picking it up. It was interesting in parts. The last third of the book picked up for me so I give it three stars.Frankly I have enjoyed this trilogy quite a bit. Timothy Zahn is definitely a decent writer but so far does not write a story capable of getting better then a 4 star review. This book was good but a little less interesting then the first. Still it is an interesting series and he does have a good character in Grand Admiral Thrawn which he depicts very well.
5,A continuation of a good story,"This book is the sequel to Heir to the Empire, a literary classic (I think) in its own right. This lives up to the same quality as its predecessor and is slightly longer. The Dark Force, referring to the Katana Fleet, mentioned in several other Star Wars Novels, is the center of this book. In addition, new leaders, like General Bel Iblis and and others. Lando is found in this book, too. It is very exciting and extremely well articulated by Mr. Zahn. I recommend reading this book also."
4,O.K. But not Zhan's best,"This book was o.k. but i have read better Star Wars books. Zahn really out did himself in the first book. But he kind of tailed off in this one. I have yet to read the Last command but it sounds good. Overall you should read it if you are reading the series or are a big Star Wars fan, otherwise read a diffrint Star Wars book."
4,Author captures the epic spirit of Star Wars space opera,"As far as post-Return of the Jedi novels about Luke, Han and Leia go, Timothy Zahn's breakthrough Thrawn Trilogy is the best.As for the best novels from the era of the movie saga, I highly recommend the following 5-star novels:Cloak of Deception (Star Wars)Shadow Hunter (Star Wars: Darth Maul)Labyrinth of Evil (Star Wars, Episode III Prequel Novel)Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader (Star Wars)Shadows of the Empire (Star Wars)"
2,It has some stupid parts,"Im sorry Star Wars fans, I am one myself but this really stinks up the pen. For one things, in this book Thrawn is not once incorrect in one of his more important hunches. It is just a bunch of repetition of the good guy gets captured and then escapes, then Thrawn finds and captures another good guy until he escapes to. Grand Admiral or not Thrawn is not a know-it-all, and for once i would like to see him misjudge an attack, or have a hunch that Leia is not on a ship that she is on. And im also wondering how he knew that Threepio's voice emulator of Leia was detected by him. This book is totally fake and I would not recommend it to any fan. After a while, the same pattern turns up in almost every situation."
5,"Thrawn Trilogy, Vol 2",Masterfully written continuation from Timothy Zahn. Excellent use of characters and plot to continue the story arc. Leads you into the third novel without wanting to stop reading.
2,This book was boring.,"Most Star Wars books took me a week to read. because of constant neglection, this one took me almost a month."
1,the worst star wars book,"forget what everyone says , Zahn's trilogy sucks. and this is the worst one. NOTHING important happens in this book. An like Hier , Thrawn is everywhere at the right time. He wastes so much time bullying the Noghris and smugglers , despite the fact that he is the leader of the Empire (which apparently consist's of Thrawns five star destroyers) Mara Jade is obnoxious and sarcastic all the time , totally unlike Liea's ""tough"" exterior seen in the movies. Karrde is an ******* who wants to take like thrawn. How many times does Zahn say ""cock an eyebrow"" ""eyes twitch"" , ""agreed"" ""point"" and all that stuff that doesnt sound att all like the movie charecters. I wanted to see huge Imperial fleets winning back sectors instead of planets , stuff like that , as it is , it's an empty , boring , unrealistic book written by an author how got so much credit simply for writing the first official star wars ""sequel"".sad."
3,Great story.....horrible version of the original paperbacks,"I have this trilogy in paperback ....and love the story. Having said that, the transcription from book to e-book is horrible. Mass mispellings, many parts of certain chapters weren'tseperated and ran back to back. It's almost as if it was typed by a 14 yr old who can't even proofread his/her own work. Half the time you can tell words were misspelled because the autocorrection completely changes the word from the original. If you have a tablet, get this trilogy on a different e-reader program."
4,starwars is back,timothy zahn is a great writer his feel for luke leia and the rest is sublime this series of books is by far the best in the novels been published about starwars great jump on for any starwars fan got me involved in collecting the other books in the ongoing saga would recommend to anyone even my dog if he could read english and who says he cant
4,Thank you Max,"This is good stuff. Hard. Fast. What metal should be. Its not sepultura. The lyrics are poorer than the stuff that Max wrote before. He seems to have felt the need to swear every few words like the nu metal crowd. the guest appearances all add to the CD...except for those horrible rappers. rap does not belong on a soulfly album. the tribal influences here are excecuted even better than in ""Roots"" My favorite tracks are ""Terrorist"" and ""Son Song"""
1,DON'T EVER BUY THIS ALBUM EDITED!!!!,"This is a great album unedited! It is worthless edited, trust me, I own the unedited version, and I can tell you, if you buy the edited version, you will probably throw it away, and get ... off, when instead you can buy the original version, and get put in the music!"
5,Soulfly at their best!!!,i love this cd. it's a lot better than the first one. i just recntly went to see them with pantera and soulfly tore the place apart.
2,Better than the 1st?? Are you kidding??,"The 1st Soulfly CD was a Godsend. Max picked up where Roots left off. Very hard, very heavy, very tribal.How can people say ""Back to the Primitive"" is better than Soulfly's debut? Quite frankly, this CD has too many guest musicians, pulling it into too many different directions, making it sound more like an experimental project. Rap and Pop have no place on a Soulfly CD. Hopefully, Max will get back to the basics and REALLY get back to the primitive on their next effort."
4,Primitive is aweasome,"This album is one of those albums that you have to understand them in order to like them. I like this album because some of the lyrics althought they're repetitive, Max seemed to have picked up the right words and the right sound to make the mood, Iis really original too and doesn't get old, i think is better than the first one."
5,Primitive,"I would honestly say this cd, along with the first, is excellent. Max has once again made a awesome cd. Sepletura just isn't the same with out Max! Diffenitly check this cd out!"
5,The best there is and what I hoped for!,"With all this crap around the world only one band has the balls to put it all togther. There is no death metal flying around here. It's 100% instruments and power. I like how Max plays and how he belts out the hits. It's a pure magical journey with tribal sounds to even out the flow. Man, I wish Soulfly would come to New York soon."
1,"Max, Please go back to Sepultura!","Max Cavalera leaving Sepultura to form this band has added two lackluster metal groups to the fold. The new Sepultura and Soulfly. This album sounds only vaguely like Sepultura because Max is the vocalist, that's about it. If you are/were a fan of Sepultura and are unhappy with the way they sound now, do not seek refuge in Soulfly! I cannot think of one good thing to say about this record. At least listen to this CD first before blindly purchasing it in the hopes it will sound anything like Sepultura. I wish I would have."
2,WHAT HAPPENED? PLEASE TELL ME!,"ALL RIGHT , SOULFLYS FIRST CD WAS THE SECOND BEST CD OF ALL TIME, BEHIND SLIPKNOT, AND NOW THIS? WHAT WENT WRONG? ITS NOT NEARLY AS HEAVY AS THE FIRST. BUY THE FIRST, BUT PASS ON THIS ONE. JUMPDAF***UP IS A GREAT SONG, SO IS BOOM, BESIDES THAT, ITS PRETTY WEAK. ALL RIGHT. SOULFLY TRIBE XXXPAINXXX"
1,not socially acceptable,"The music on the record is horrible. Listen to the song entitled ""Mulambo"" and try telling me that Soulfly didn't steal the riff from Nirvana's ""Scentless Apprentice"". ""In Memory Of"" is a rap song with a horribly annoying ""hook"" that consists of nothing but screaming. Max Cavalera's voice is really bad, and his Brazilian accent starts to get irritating by the end of the record.""Terrorist"" is by far the worst song here. It features Tom Arays from Slayer, The lyrics are not socially acceptable. They encourage terrorism. After listening to it, teenage boys will think that terrorism is cool. Look at what happened on September 11th and then try listening to this song without being angry at Soulfly and Tom Araya. Let's not forget Tom Araya's singing. He sounds like a 13 year old boy whose voice is changing. His voice cracks and sounds inconsistent.This disc is horrible and an insult to American society. Do America a favor and buy something from Van Halen instead."
1,big disapointment,"HOW DARE ANYONE COMPAIR THIS TO EARLY SEPULTERA. THE GUITARS ARE REALY BORING AND SIMPLE YET TRY TO SOUND HEAVY AND LETS NOT EVEN BRING UP THE DRUMMING...TERRIBAL! SEPULTERA WAS 1000 TIMES MORE HEAVIER,ANGRIER,AGGREESIVE,THAN THIS BELOW AVERAGE D- GRADE NU METAL BAND!"
2,WHY?,"i don't understand this album there are only 2 or 3 good songsand most of it sounds the same, sorry but sepultura is much betterhe could still be touring with his other band i'm sorry buti am not impressed by this album"
1,"Oh, Say It Ain't So, Max...","It was a sad day when this was released. Max completely went nu-metal on us all. And not the good kind. Read the lyrics to ""Back To The Primitive."" Then listen to the actual 'song.' WHY, MAX, WHY? There's even a rap song on here, as well as a duet with Tom Araya that promotes TERRORISM?! MAAAAAAXX! In fact, the only worthwhile song is ""Jumpda****up"" with Corey Taylor's vocal talents saving the song marginally. It's still filled with Max showing off his 'fat street-wyze rhym bustin'. What a shame. Just listen to Sepultura for this tribal-metal shtick done right."
2,Go listen to Sepultura,"If you want a great album with Max on it, then get Arise or Schitzophrenia.This album is terrible. The lyrics are basically swearing every other word, the sound is Max's most commercial yet, the tribal themes are overused and were done better on Roots, and quite frankly this lacks the heavy powerful punch of pre-Chaos AD Sepultura. Add to that the inclusion of RAP, this makes for a CD that makes me wanna puke. So unless you're into nu-metal and you want something that has the same old sound with a few tribal elements that have been done before (but better), stay away from this album."
3,I think Max is running out of ideas,"Max Cavalera, the legendary voice of Sepultura, formed his own band Soulfly in 98, and put out their second album ""Primitive"" in 2000. ""Primitive"" seems more mainstream aimed than their self titled debut, and there are more guest stars on this than their debut. Corey from Slipknot sings on ""Jumpdaf*ckup"", and Tom Araya of the mighty Slayer sings on ""Terrorist"", which are the best tracks on the album. A lot of the songs seem like Max didn't put too much thought into them and the production sounds like the album was a bit rushed. All in all, ""Primitive"" is decent, but older fans of Sepultura will want to stick to their old Sepultura albums."
5,Brazilian Energy!,"The new Soulfly album, primitive is alot better than the self titled debut! The first album was not half bad, but this one is 100 times better! The guest appearances are awesome! The bonus tracks alone are worth 15 dollars!"
5,Fieldbook for TRIZ,"Zinovy Royzen is an expert master of TRIZ and instructor of thousands of TRIZ practitioners. This fieldbook will enable anyone who has studied TRIZ to use the full problem solving power of the method without requiring expensive software packages or other aids. His flow chart is masterful in helping to pick the right tool set for your situation. The book is especially powerful for Zinovy's simplification of ARIZ-85, its all there, but it just seems to flow better with Zinovy's approach. The same can be said for his innovative TOP analysis, which supplants the difficult Su-Field analysis.If you are an engineer who has taken a TRIZ class, but needs a guide for actually applying TRIZ, this book is for you. If you have not studied TRIZ, what are you waiting for? Your competitors are out-innovating you!"
5,my captain oliver,really enjoyed this out of print book....family member part of story and mentioned in book. Book arrived promptly.very happy with purchase.My captain Oliver: A story of two missionaries on the British Columbia coast
3,Stoner Movie,"The movie looks very low budget, like actors Deon and Merlin where at a friends house and said ""hey lets film our own movie"". That being said for 1.98 I didn't go into this expecting much. At the very least it showed off the young men's talent at playing multiple and somewhat diverse roles - ie. the old men and the Jamaicans. I can see someone getting a kick out of this if they're intoxicated like the characters were. Think of a low budget - less funny ""How High"" movie. Only because I like the actors did I give it 3 stars."
3,The Santana of Schumann's,"3 1/2Montoliu is a fine, fiery Latin pianist who here delivers a solid set of relaxed Spanish passion in his playing, though rarely composes with more intent than to run all over the fretboard under fairly predictable cultured chords."
3,Nevertheless,"Alexandra Ruffini is not up to the Super-star demands of the ""Bell Song"", and Giuseppe Morino's reedy quality may be annoying to some, but their duets are exceptionally affecting. This is a generally fine performance of an old fashioned, lyrical gem."
4,"Perfection dimmed, but there's still much to enjoy","By the time this CD came out in 1997, the musical world was hanging on to every note played by Kissin, a prodigy and a genius above reproach. Then everyone's collective heart sank as the Moonlight sonata unfolded in a plodding, uninspired way--for the first time perfection was dimmed. Sadly enough, it has continued to. Kissin's talent shines by fits and starts now.On this CD the Beethoven must be passed over with some embarrassment, but the Franck is compelling and the Brahms, as everyone else has noted, is superb. Over the years Kissin's interpretation of Schubert and Schumann, once two of his best composers, has begn to suffer from coarseness, and his once incomparable Chopin has turned to grandstanding. Luckily, we have many earlier recitals to enjoy, and one hopes there will be a return to greatness from this unique musician."
5,Stunning Tour de Force,"This is a spare and elegant beauty, a collection of lovingly chosen cover tunes interpreted with a very close, personal understated touch by this veteran singer-songwriter. Damn!"
5,Great product... really fast delivery!,It's the best price I could find online.And Amazon's delivery is really fast and trackable.
4,Mucha muchacha,"The theme by Juan Esquivel cannot be left out, since is the cue for the second most enjoyed activity of B&B. There is no substitute for the laughs caused by the association between the theme and the activity the heroes are about to perform."
5,I love this movie!,"People, Auntie Mame drank and stayed up all night. What do you want her to sound like Julie Andrews! COME ON! Lucy does a FINE job in this movie! THIS IS NOT A BROADWAY SHOW PEOPLE! I love this movies SO much I bought the soundtrack! I don't care if Lucy sounds ""horrible""...SHE WAS MAME!"
5,A Supperb Switch From The Traditional Lucy!,"A couple of people who have posted reviews didn't like this movie for reasons nothing more than Lucy wasn't being ""Lucy."" Well Lucille Ball was not just a comedian, she was an actress! She wasn't confined to one genre and she displays her versatility magnificently in this film. Her upbeat personality adds so much to this film and her connection with little Patrick is perfect. And as for her singing...THIS WAS NOT A BROADWAY SHOW! This is the screen adaptation and that quality is not expected. Don't get me wrong,she did a terrific job anyways. And for those of you who are expecting to see the traditional ""Lucy"" you can find it. She does a great job of blending a little comedy into the film. I highly recomend purchasing this video! I LOVE LUCY!"
3,"Not as good as the stage show, but not as bad as some said","We bought this tape (and the Broadway cast CD) because my son is playing the ""Young Patrick"" role in a community theater production of the show. What surprised me was how much the movie changes the plot of the musical, even adding a new song (which does nothing for me). Some secondary characters (e.g. Pegeen) are changed completely, and the script is rather different in many places.Lucy is as ill-suited for the role as everyone has noted, with the soft-focus producing cruel giggles at every close-up. The Young Patrick actor is fairly weak (but of course, I'm comparing him to my own son!). Bea Arthur OWNS the role of Vera. The various supporting actors are good if not great.With some Broadway musicals that have been made into movies, the transition is an improvement, from a pure-entertainment standpoint. Alas, that's not the case here. It would have been great if Angela Lansbury could have been cast."
2,bad bad bad,I love the movie Auntie Mame. Rosland Russel does a great job of capturing the crazy aunt caracter. I also love love love Lucile Ball. She is a wonder actress and fantastic comedian. BUT this screen play should have never been made into a musical. No matter how cool musicals were at the time. Please don't waste your money on this one and just get the earlier rendition. It will capture your heart and you will fall in love with Aunti Mame.
1,Choose life. Choose Rosalind Russell.,"Watching Lucille Ball in this movie is like watching something slowly dying on the floor. You don't know if it can hear or see you, and you cry, already missing the life ebbing from it's poor, ravaged little body. IF YOU ARE A LUCY FAN, STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE. It is poison for the soul."
1,Mame Goes South,"Unfortunately, the movie version of the Broadway smash did not star Angela Lansbury. Lucille Ball was far too old to play the effervesent, eccentric Auntie Mame. She can't sing the wonderful Jerry Herman score and throughout the film she is shot through what appears to be gauze. The movie is leaden and dull. Best stick with the original Auntie Mame with Rosiland Russell."
5,worthy of being added to any collection,"While I prefer the original copy with rosalind russell, but this one was done very well, and the songs n choregraphed very well, the outfits n sets are wonderful, this is definitely one I had to have for my collection!"
5,Lucy IS Mame,Lucille Ball was excellent as Mame in this DVD. I purchased it for my 87 year old cousin who could fit right in with those two!!
2,"unforgettable, and not in a good way","I saw this movie musical version of Mame twice, once around 1977 or 1978, and again in 1980. And although I'm sure I have forgotten some of it's virtues, I haven't forgotten Lucy's singing, and how inadequate it was for this role. I never could figure out why they didn't put Angela Lansbury in the film version. But then again, even at a rather young age, I was suspicious of Hollywood's take on Broadway musicals after seeing Barbra Streisand in Hello Dolly (which I didn't think was anything special, either, but at least Streisand could sing)."
3,I LOVE LUCY BUT MAME DOESN'T,"I've read all the prior reviews and it seems people either love or hate this movie! Lucille Ball was absolute DYNAMITE as Lucy Ricardo but as Mame Dennis, she was just too old and tired to pull it off! Rosalind Russell was ten years younger that Lucy's 62 when she played the part so successfully in 1958.(Had Lucy tried this 15 years earlier,she'd probably have been terrific!) I agree with an other reviewer that by this time, her grace,timing and vigor had pretty much vanished. NOBODY Loves Lucy better than I do and over the years she's become a national monument. The only problem is that in this film she performs like one!(and the gauzey look of the film itself is a reminder of Lucy's age; it's obvious she did'nt want her wrinkled face highlighted in her close-ups)"
3,"Poor, Old Lucy!","She tries, OK? She tries really hard. To sing and dance and act spunky, all the while hidden behind a gossamer of soft diffusion material to soften up her aging skin. I can live with that----but LUCY SINGING? Oh brother.When she belts outs ""Open A New Window"" you 'll want to jump out of yours. Regardless, it's hard to ignore this as it IS SO awful, but I love it for that very reason. I saw this in a drive-in of all places when it came out, and still have that memory burned into my brain whenever I catch this film. Do give Miss Lucy a chance and watch this film!"
2,Shoulda been Angela Lansbury,"MAME is one of my two favorite Broadway musicals. Saw it three time, none with Angela however. When the musical was made, Angela Lansbury should have been allowed to recreate her character for the screen, but instead the role was given to Lucy as a ""last hurrah."" I understand that, but Lucy (and I do love Lucy) was too far past her prime to do justice to the role for the movie. The production was super lavish, and everything was wonderful (including Bea Arthur) except for the leading lady. But because I love the show so, I had to have the DVD of MAME anyway. I can only imagine how much better it could have been with Angela in the role she was meant to play."
5,mame,"this has always been one of my favourite musicals. i wanted to purchase it on dvd for sometime but has only recently been released, or that it is only available in the usa and not in the uk.it is always a delight to watch the film and hope a stage version comes along also."
4,Where has it been?,"I don't know why it took so long for this movie to make it to DVD, but it's long overdue! We saw the movie in cinerama when it first came out in 1974 and have been looking forward to seeing it again ever since. It's even more entertaining than we remembered. I've seen the reviews that trash the movie. All I can say is, ""Are we watching the same movie?"" The movie is well done and entertaining in every respect. Period."
3,"I do love Lucy, but...","Here, Lucy sets out to remind us why she's the Queen of comedy...with her singing. She's not new to big screen Hollywood musicals having starred in a few herself, but she ought to remember why her singing was ALWAYS dubbed...the gal can't sing. And in her 60's, she seemed more like Patrick's grandmother than his Auntie Mame. Bea Arthur top a brilliant supporting cast and it was great to hear the Asian character speak proper English. I agree with other reviewers' rave about the technical aspects, costume, sets, etc. And if you want to hear what Mame, the musical should sound like, buy the broadway cast recording from 1966 with Lansbury. This MAME is strictly for Lucy's fans. Can she do no wrong?"
2,"Not as good as Lucy's other movies, but not all that bad.","This movie is not the best one Lucille Ball has ever done, but it is not as terrible as people seem to think. The only problem was Lucy's voice. I admire Lucy greatly, but let's face it: her voice has changed a lot since ""I Love Lucy"" due to her age and her constant smoking. But overall, the costumes were great and the songs were ok too """
5,BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!!!!,"Lucy was 62 years old when she did this film and she never looked better! So what if some of the shots of her are ""blurred."" If you look at any of the film noirs from the 30's and 40's, a lot, and I mean a lot of the actresses where photographed that way!!!!!!!Lucy's costumes were stunning not to mention the set for 3 Beekman Place!The film is brilliant!!!!! PERIOD!!"
4,Mame,"First off, I have to say that Auntie Mame with Roslind Russell is one of my favorite movies. That being said, I will say that this version was a bit of a disappointment. I loved the music, and it always a treat to see Robert Preston. Other than that, it was a little flat."
1,I find the Lucy defense hilarious,"The passion with which hard-core Lucy fans defend their idol's worst career move is always funny to read, particularly the person who keeps insisting, ""It was not Lucy's fault, she was doing what she was told.""Ahem.Lucy bought the rights to the musical, she picked the director, she had Madeline Kahn axed (since she would have walked off with the movie), and she insisted upon starring in it herself. If that doesn't make her worthy of fault in this case, I don't know what does.In any event, it's nice to see that the original ""Auntie Mame"" with Rosalind Russell is now available letterboxed on both VHS and DVD--that's the version to get."
1,One of the Worst Cinematic Transfers of a Broadway Musical,"I'm sorry this is coming out on DVD. It is a terrible celluloid version of a wonderful Broadway musical. I saw the original with Angela Lansbury and it was marvelous. I couldn't wait to see the movie thinking that this would be Lucille Ball's crowning achievement. Alas, the only good thing about the show was Robert Preston and his new song entitled ""Loving You."" The film ""Mame"" was touted as a must-see with Madeline Kahn portraying Gouch and the inimitable Bea Arthur as Vera, but alas Kahn and Lucy came to blows precipitating the former's walking off the set and Arthur looked like a very bad drag queen.I really am sorry this musical film has been transferred to DVD, while the lovely ""Goodbye Mr. Chips,"" with endearing performances by Peter O'Toole, Petula Clark and Sian Phillips, lies wasting somewhere in videoville.Life ain't fair."
1,Yuk,"If not for The Song Of Norway, this could well be the worst musical movie ever made.The acting (apart from Bea Arthur) is dreadful, the production numbers are cloying, and the pacing is slow, slow, and painfully slow.Auntie Mame with Roz Russell is one of the great movies of all time. This one is on the other end of the spectrum."
3,Give her a break,"Lucille Ball(Mame) is actually in good company. if my memory serves me right both Gypsy(film) and Hello Dolly(film) were panned and the stars belittled for their attempts. We now know those are classics. And in Gypsy ros russell couldnt sing her way out of a bag so she was dubbed and that wasnt any better but no one has ever been more convincing in that part. Lucy's mame is quite convincing and actually alittle more real the roz russells(Autie Mame) and lucy's mame is quite goodlooking. Finally if for no other reason she opened the door and the window for older actresses in those types of parts. Think 'Mama Mia"" Streep(way old for that part)And i understand Cher is in a musical to be releases playing a aged stripper who im sure is not suppose to be approching 70. oh yea and also Judy Dench and Sofia Loren were the only good things in Nine and they aint to young and really cant sing. so Lucy is in some good company."
1,The Rosalind Russell version is better.,"I am a big fan of the non-musical, Rosalind Russell version, ""Auntie Mame"" (1948), so I view this movie with a slight bias. This version seems a little meaner than the earlier one -- perhaps an attempt to ""modernize"" it. But somehow, Lucy's portrayal fails capture the heart of what makes Mame Dennis so appealing... her whacky joie de vive and her absolute love (absolutely reciprocated) for her nephew Patrick. The best thing about this movie is Agnes Gooch's song, which comes almost towards the end. I was also surprised to find that the song ""We Need a Little Christmas"" is from this play."
5,"Good Music, Good Acting, Delightful","I thought the film was very very good, the only thing that dissapointed me was that when Lucy is getting dressed to go hunting, they cut the part where she comes out of her room with her riding boots wrong, the left on the right and the right on the left. The riding scene is amasing, whoever the lady that rode sidesaddle was, I take my hat off to her for she did a superb job. I highly recommend it!!!"
3,For the love of Lucy,"Everyone loves Lucy, but it appears that she had a hard time separating Mame from Lucy Ricardo. Had they only dubbed her singing voice... Angela Lansbury, where were you in 1973?"
2,Lucy Barks!,"Too terrible to be boring, you can fixated watching this wondering exactly what Lucille Ball thought she was doing. When that sound comes out-it's something between a bark and a quaver-does she really think she's singing? When she throws up her arms in their giant red bat sleeves and yells ""Listen, everybody""! does she really think she's a fun person? Lucille Ball was a genius in her television series but she was too old, too basso in the voice & stringy in the legs to pull off Mame. Lucy at this point in her career had'nt the gregarious personality (a'la Lanbury or Russell) that is neccesary in the playing of this character; her performance seems tired, flat, self-conscious and insincere. Desi among others begged Lucy not to play this role, but she would'nt listen (just as she skied and broke her leg at 62) I love Lucy, too, but this has got to go!"
3,BEA ARTHUR SAVES THE DAY,"The often-told story of Mame Dennis never fails to entertain -- even this misbegotten take on the Jerry Herman tuner. I do not think Lucy is so hideous -- she certainly retains her charm and humor throughout, but those vocals .... However, the delicious Bea Arthur more than compensates, and she steals virtually every scene with her Vera Charles, who is the model for drag queens everywhere. Her spot-on line readings, particularly in the well-produced Man on the Moon sequence, is fresh and funny even today. The sumptuous production values, Vaseline-covered lens for Lucy not withstanding, deserve mention, as does Robert Preston, who is always effervescent. Worth watching."
3,Rosanand Russel did it best!,"I've been on a nostalgia kick this week, and I watched the 1958 version of Mame first, and the differences between the two versions stand out in strong contrast.Mark Twain once said, ""reality is stranger than fiction, because fiction has to make sence"". The 1958 film does this, the later remake doesen't-- the writeing is tipical of the 70's; fragmented, sensored, and trying to make a non statement about anything.As much as I love 'Lucy', in this film she, the writers, producers, ect., didn't make a movie that 'tied together'--it had none of the whit, sarcasim, humor, and social commentary that the 1958 film had, and I feel sorry; Rosanand Russel is 'Mame', 'Lucy' is not.If you want to enjoy a clasic, watch the oridiginal movie, not the pale remake."
1,Not as bad as the B.S. version of Hello Dolly at least,"Be thankful for small favors that as bad as this film version of Mame is (and it is unfortunately poor), at least it doesn't surpass the Barbra Streisand version of Hello Dolly as, perhaps, the worst big budget Hollywood musical ever made. Mame is, like the Rosalind Russell version of Gypsy, bad casting that can't be masked by glossy production values. The inability of either of these lead actresses to truly be able to sing, as brilliant as they were in virtually everything else that they did before the camera, carries no weight here and this inability sinks both films from the get go."
2,not your typical Lucille Ball movie,"hi! ok so i'm a big Lucille Ball fan. but this is one of the worst! in this movie she goes from a brunett to a redhead in like everyother scene. my oppinion is this is a very confusing movie. i wached it and it took me about 3 days when Lucy movies usually take me about the amount its supposed 2 take. Then rewined it and wach it all over again for a 3 day period. i must admit though the music is very good. and some parts of the movie where funny, but overall it was soo bad! i recommened ""The Long,Long Trailer"" or ""Forever Darling""."
1,One of the worst musicals ever made!,"Lucy is great on TV, but she cannot be the kind of mega star needed to put this material across. She doesn't have that great chraisma of Roz Russell, or Angela Lansbury, who should have been in this film.It is dead from the beginng, no life at all, and Lucy seems to know it.Did Auntie Mame ever really need music? Esp. of this awful sort?? Roz Russell reigns over all remakers and their casts. Her film is IT, and Herman and Lucy should have known better.I saw Lucy in Wildcat years ago..very funny, very unconventional,but limiting. Her kind of comedy is in the Marx Bros. tradition; and this is her genuius, not this stuff. Even Angela L. had trouble with Mamme's terrible lyrics and serious moments.Poor Lucy..she needed a better attraction than this, and the director, notoriously bad.Forget this and go to Roz Russell and Lucy's TV show from the 50's, not the later shows from the 60's, which have Mameish qualities that are best avoided."
2,the original is still the best,First of all the original version with Russel is much better. Lucille Ball doesn't even compare to MS Russel. it was a mistake to remake this classic especially with that tired old hag Lucille Ball. if you actually liked this version then i highly recommend the 1956 version with Roseland Russel.
4,Mame,"I love this movie both version. I purchased them for mother, daughter and myself. Now instead of waiting to see if it might be shown on TV we can look at it anytime. It has not gotten old at all!"
2,Good for the camp,"Hollywood never learns. Not only is this not the first time they adapt a Broadway musical and miscast the main role. First Audrey Hepburn massacres My Fair Lady. Now our beloved Lucy ruins this Jerry Herman gem. Angela Lansbury would have done a wonderful job. She proved it on Broadway.But, It is also not the first time Lucy commits this type of suicide. Remember DuBarry Was A Lady? The should have given the role to the original and incomparable Ethel Merman."
2,"If Life is a Banquet, Lucy's been at the Table too Long!","Premise: Lucy Ricardo asks Ricky if she can be in his show, and after many, many, looong years of her begging, he says yes. And this is the result. Sad for Lucy fans, it's the car accident phenomenon: you hate to look, but you can't help it. Get this video for the pure horror! There's enough gauze and Vaseline on the camera lens in her close-ups, it looks like she should break out singing ""A Foggy Day in London Town"". Argh! Oh, the horror! This should be in everyone's video library, next to their copy of ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"", except it should be titled, ""Whatever Happened to Lucy Ricardo?""!I understand the musical (with Jerry Herman's wonderful score--and the bitchy ""Bosom Buddies"" number is fantastic!) is being redone with Cher--yes, CHER!--as MAME. CHER is MAME! Now that's gonna be something worth seeing!"
2,Finally coming out on DVD....,"THE MUSICAL VERSION OF ""NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD."" YEAH! oh, wait, this is the lucille ball version of ""Mame."" Well, the same thing then!"
2,Cheesy and a waste of time,"After reading the book ""Auntie Mame"" by the real Patrick Dennis I decided to watch both of the movies to see how they treated the story.I was very pleased with the Rosalind Russell version. She does an excellent job playing the part of Auntie Mame. The entire 1958 version is hilarious, and with the exception of the hydraulic furniture scene, stays true to the book.However, this Lucille version is a bomb if I've ever seen one. Since when is Agnes Gooch Patrick's nanny? She was Mame's first secretary until her pregnancy. Pegeen was changed completely. Lucille Ball was far past her prime to star in this part. To top it off, the cheesiness of turning a story like this into a musical was beyond description!I don't recommend spending your hard-earned money on this one. Purchase the Rosalind Russell version instead. You won't regret choosing that one over this one!"
1,A REALLY BAD ADAPTATION OF A GREAT MUSICAL.,"Don't get me wrong. I LOVE LUCY!!! But she's all wrong as Mame. And this movie, well, it is not my favorite . IT'S DREADFUL! Now, Roz Russell was a great Auntie Mame, but she didn't want to do the musical, and she was a bit long-in-the-tooth when it opened on Broadway. The best thing the producers could have done was to cast the original musical Mame, the great Angela Lansbury, in the role. But they didn't, to our regret. As for Lucy's performance, let us draw the curtain of charity over that!"
3,A COLD AND RIGID PERFORMANCE..,"I read somewhere that Miss Ball was rather ruthless in getting to play this role. I give Lucy's singing a ""D"". I give the opening credits an ""A""...very nice art direction there. I give Robert Preston singing ""Loving You"" an ""A"". The rest of the cast is great. there is something else awkward about this film version of the musical besides Lucy's croaking through her numbers, and that is her acting! She is a cold Mame, really, the warmth and whimsy of the character Mame Dennis Burnside is hidden in this stiff performance. I also remember reading that Lucy had to battle with these very heavy hats and costumes and it made her cranky. Gotta give it to the old broad though...hey, she tried...so I'll give her a ""C"" for effort."
2,MAIMED,"Great story, but see the Rosalind Russell version with the brilliant Comden and Green writing team.I Love Lucy, but not in this."
2,Please give me Rosalind!,"You can take ""Mame"" and give me ""Auntie Mame"" with Russell any day of the week. The latter movie has better sets, costumes, and most importantly acting. I have no idea why the decided to remake it in the first place. Lucille Ball had so much life on ""I Love Lucy""! What happened? Shes so absolutely lifeless and monotone in this. Terribly disappointing."
5,GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH,"I agree that people just need to give Lucille Ball a chance! I thought that she gave an INCREDIBLE performance! I have a copy of the soundtrack to the original cast, and Angela Lansbury just didn't hit the character as Lucille did. As for Ms. Arthur, Mr. Preston and Jane Connell, increedible all around! I love every minute of it. And just to explain: Lucille Ball's voice WAS incredible and I loved it!"
4,Great little gadget,Used it to help start the siphon out of my glass carboy- read the tip on a homebrew thread and it looked easy enough. Worked really well! No more sucking on tubes to start a siphon! A great stocking stuffer for a home-brewer!
3,WooHoo!! It's out on the 25th!,"YESSSHH! THE SIMS MAKIN MAGIC is out in TWO days! My friend (who uses a Windows OS) says that it's REALLY fun and the new skins are cool. My other friend says that it's a waste of thirty dollars. So my first friend said that the second friend isn't at all creative! And there's this other person that says its the best! I guess I'll buy it, probably after hearing some reviews. I bought the Sims Superstar as soon as it came out and it had 1 bug in it that kept me from going any higher than 3 stars, so I had to find a patch, but ASPYR didn't have one and I was all mad, but I downloaded this thing where I could edit the starpower. Yes, I think I'll buy it."
2,Is Progressive dead?,"If it is, this may be the CD that drives the final nail into the coffin. Long, dull and uninspiring, Global provides little energy other than the usual long proggy build-ups that leave you wishing for something a little harder and faster. PVD needs to look to his fellow artists and see that they are moving along. I understand the need to please his fans, but for those who have followed him this is not a growth spurt, but rather a statement that the status quo is acceptable."
3,Expected better,Frist off I love PVD his music is great. I couldnt wait to get the DVD/Cd in the mail. When it came I was disapointed with the DVD. I was under the impression that it was more of him interacting with the camera maybe with him giving a little peek into his life and where he has been. That wasnt the case all it is basicly is a video of the places he has been with some tracks played along. There is no narration and PVD is not in the video alot. The CD is the same tracks palyed on the DVD. The CD I will listen to but the DVD I watched once and will probably never watch again. Very disapointed.
5,Perfect introduction to Paul Van Dyk,"Trance, dance, electronica fans, or anyone interested in finding out what Paul Van Dyk's music is all about, check GLOBAL out. Although the tracks are mostly re-worked mixes of already well-known PVD hits, the mix is impressive and well-executed. The bonus DVD alone justifies the purchase. Enjoy."
5,OOooooooHHellll YYYYYYYYYYYeah,"Three words :Step Right On ....One of the best TRANCE tracks of all time !PVD is definetly one of my fav dj's,and he's mixing skills are simply amazing...All the previously unreleased songs,and the DVD are sweet. From start to finish an Top Notch mix,do yourself a favor and go get this one,you'll thank me later!"
4,Nice sample of PvD's Greatest Hits,"Well, I was privileged enough to get an advance copy of this work. I think PvD is best in delivering high energy trance, and Global is a nice sample of his most popular works. The two previously unreleased tracks at the end of this CD are good but did not compel me to listen to either track after listening to them a first time. Animacion is more in line with PvD's latest works, whereas My World seems to reflect something from Paul's early days. It would seem to have fit well with CD 3 of Vorsprung. I think this is a handy CD to have if you are a PvD fan, and a nice survey of Paul's works if you are looking to become more familiar with PvD. I think however they should have included Autumn on this CD. Although if I had to choose one PvD release to bring with me on a deserted island, I would rank this behind The Politics of Dancing, Out There and Back, and Vorsprung Dyk Technik."
2,PVDs Greatest Hits?,"What? PVD just had 11 great hits? I know he had more hits than that. Basically, ""Global"" is only good for newbies. Why get ""Global"" if you have all first three of PVDs albums. One way to get people to buy ""Global"" is the dvd. Who wants to be in front of the screen all day watching videos? Nothing really new here except for two tracks ""Animacion"" and ""My World"". I actually liked them and wished he had put them on a separate new album."
4,okay cd...not his best,"this cd was okay....i do enjoy the dvd though. A new spin to the music. I wish i wouldnt have bought it, since its a retrospective with older songs on it. Anways, there is two new ones, which i enjoy. The mixing is nice and the tracklisting is good too. Paul van Dyk is a great one too. His best owrk is definitely politics of dancing"
2,Disappointing... for hardcore PVD fans like me,"Of course this CD is awesome, it's PVD. But for those girls that have listened to ALL his albums, and have ALL his live sets, ""Global"" can be somewhat disappointing. Nothing emergency-pull-out-your-credit-card new, really. I would have instead purchased the single for the new songs, Animación and My World, if there had been one. *The DVD consists of shots of raves where PVD has spun, in sort of like a trip around the world. And there are moments when an asian raver or two scream out WOOoOOoooo!! Paul Van Dyk is the best! WhoOoooo!!! to bring you crashing down out of the trance trip. For one of the songs, I think it is ""Tell Me Why"", the DVD scene is the actual music video PVD made. But you already have that video in ""Out there and Back""... so... GLOBAL is a nice mix, but I would have preferred just new material. Maybe this is the way PVD will get the money to produce a new album. I hope one comes out soon!"
2,Worst Millencolin Cd,"I love Millencolin and but this cd doesnt sound like them at all it has way too much Ska on it the only songs that are moderately acceptable are Da Strike and Mr. Clean both of which are more funny than anything else, if you wanna buy a millencolin cd buy For Monkeys it Kicks A$$!"
5,The Best in Dixieland,If you like Dixieland you will love this one. I bought it to replace a vinyl LP record that was worn out long ago from playing.Jimmy Dorsey's Dixie band is the best ever. IMO. Dixie played the way it's meant to be played.
5,A great guide to Jewish holidays,"""Dance, Sing, Remember: A Celebration of Jewish Holidays"" is a book that is both enjoyable and educational. Although it is directed towards children, it is a good resource for all ages. Leslie Kimmelman's well-written text is effectively complemented by Ora Eitan's colorful, impressionistic illustrations.The text covers the major Jewish observances: Rosh Hashahah, Yom Kippur, Yom Hashoah, etc. The name of each observance is given both in Hebrew characters and in English translation or transliteration. The text gives definitions of such relevant terms as shofar, sukkah, and latkes.There is a lot of fun supplementary material: a recipe for harvest muffins, instructions on how to play the dreidel game, a retelling of the story of Jonah, and more. Eitan's illustrations are excellent: they range from the solemn to the whimsical. Overall, this is a good book for children of all religious and cultural backgrounds."
2,Before you get too excited,"This is not a bad book. However, I was disappointed because I guess I misunderstood what ""simple yet thorough"" meant. This is very simple; it is for 4-8 year olds and they mean it. I didn't learn a whole lot and that's a lot of money to pay for a simple book. I don't believe this is a complete list of holidays. There is no month listed for the holiday! There was no explanation of the Jewish calendar and of how they calculate years. I'm pretty sure there was not an activity for each holiday, which was a big minus (I borrowed this from the library). (Side note: if your child has food allergies, you would end up with not many activities to do at all.) So instead of billing this as an activity-filled ""thorough"" book, I would say it would probably be a nice read-aloud to your child. You could probably find the same information online (which is what I plan to do with my children)."
5,A Must Read!!,Wonderful review of the Insurance industry and the internet age! I would recommend this to anyone and everyone interested or employed in the Insurance business! This company has developed ideas that will change the insurance industry... I applaud the very brilliant author! and will be waiting to see his business at the top of Fortune 500's list!
3,Insurance Salesmen are dead.,"I feel the insurance salesman is dying. I believe in a financial planner, one who can integrate investments with insurance. They can structure your financial future all by one person. I felt the book was informative, but wasn't descriptive enough. I would encourage anyone in the business to take a look at the book."
3,It Might Feel Right,"When it comes to Sugar Ray, they truly always know about how to really make good party-like anthems and jingles. There aren't that many bands that really seem to do that at this time. Although they can still provide a jingle, they seem to have fallen a dash out of place with their latest one. Mr. Bartender (It's So Easy), is the first time we've heard the band experiment with cravings of Hip Hop to the page. The song does fit in the key, for all those late night jingles they've made, but also for the rejected working class that is still seeking jobs. I really think it will probably go out there for awhile. I just hope they don't lose the touch."
4,Lots and Lots of Songs,"This is a collection of Nobodys' 7 inches, demos, and tracks from compilations. Any serious Nobodys fan must buy this to complete their collection. With 52 tracks on this disc it is well worth the buy, even though there are a few stinkers here. The music is typical Nobodys fare and should make a fan really happy."
4,it grows on you,"this is a great cd. it may not seem so good at first, but after listening to it a few times it gets alot better. because there are so many full length tracks, that there are some bad ones but a majority are good."
4,Nobodys - 'Greatasstits' (Hopeless Records),"Fifty-two track compilation of this Colorado '90's punk band's rarities, demos, unreleased cuts and 7"" singles. Most of these tunes run under the two-minute mark. With plenty of songs to choose from to mention - I liked ""All Kinds Of Girls"", the catchy ""I Love My Gun"", ""I Never Wanted Anything To Change"", their homage to AC/DC with ""You Shook Me All Night Long"", their cover of Sammy Hagar's ""I've Done Everything For You"", ""We Go Together"", the awesome ""Young, Blonde And Dumb"" and ""Piece Of Ass"" the best. An ideal find for fans of Rancid, Green Day, Dillinger Four and Blink-192. Enjoy."
4,"Great Play Hut, doesn't come with everything listed though....","My son, who just turned one, LOVES this!The item discription states that it comes with the Hut, 100 balls, and tunnal attachments.The attachments do not come with this toy. The hut and the balls come only.Still not a bad deal, durable (so far), and my son (age 1) loves it!"
1,Not for us,"My kids have had ball pits since my first (age 6) was a baby. None last more than a year or so, so we are used to replacing them. This one, however, was the worst one we've ever gotten. The kids would run in, and it would fall over. The openings are so low to the ground, balls were constantly rolling out. It was a ridiculous mess. We kept it only a few days before deciding it definitely isn't for us. After returning it, we found a nice oval shaped blow-up pool at the store and bought that. Perfect ball bit!"
4,Fun for kids!,My son loves this toy. The only problem is that the bottom is short so all the balls keep coming out.
5,Huge Ball Pit,"I was so excited when we opened this up. It's huge! I can easily fit in with my four kids and have fun with them. I wasn't expecting it to be so big. Of course, like everyone says there's never enough balls, but we still have some more coming as another Christmas gift. Great Buy!"
4,Magic Ball Zone,The Magic Ball Zone has been a lot of fun for my twins age 22 months. Just as the others have written you will need to order more balls or there just will not be enough. I would say even ordering two more bags would be better than just one.The one thing I don't like about the tent is my twins keep pushing in the sides from the outside and the balls spill out all over the floor. This is something I need to work on with them :). But something to consider if you are thinking about buying this.The positive is it is VERY easy to open and put away when needed. It is not really big but not tiny either. So when you need a break from the tent you can fold it up and put it in the nice bag that comes with it. You will also get a really nice HUGE mesh bag that will hold about 300 balls. That has been really nice for storage!
1,Too many openings for the balls to fall out,"I already had a ton of balls from an old inflatable ball pit when we purchased this. It has too many openings that aren't deep enough to hold the balls in. So the balls spill all over the place and the children are left with nothing but a mess to clean up. If I hadn't paid so much in shipping I would have returned it. I have massively duct taped two of the sides allowing only one entrance and one way for the balls to come out. I do plan to buy velcro to closed the front door to allow the kids to have fun playing in the balls. If you would like ball pit without balls and balls everywhere else but where they belong, this is the toy for you."
4,Big fun for little ones!,"We bought this for our son's first birthday. He loves it! So does our five-year-old! Be sure to purchase at least 100 extra balls so it fills up, but be prepard to have lots of balls around the house! I would definitely buy it again."
2,Not my favorite,"I didn't find this book nearly as good as the previous books, something was definitely missing. I miss the Alex Jensen mysteries which started the series. Hope she brings him back soon."
5,Love the Alaskan Mysteries!,I started reading Sue Henry's books about AK last year and keep looking for more. We have family in AK so they are especially meaningful to me as we can see the maps inside and all the places we have been. She keeps the suspense going through the whole book and I always look forward to beginning another of her special stories.
2,"No dog racing, no blizzards","Sue Henry has managed to write a hum-drum murder mystery which just happens to be set in the Alaskan wilderness. Bah! Humbug! Usually, she manages to educate us about the frozen North as she entertains us, but this time, she resorts to the old Hollywood technique of having her main characters do stupid things to get into harm's way, and then rescues them just in the nick of time ( and sometimes lets them crash and burn ). A rainy-day time-killer, but not one I would buy and/or keep.Charlie"
2,I wonder,I have collected all of Sue Henrys' books and usually enjoy them. This book is not one I am sure I wnat to keep on my shelf. It was not up to her normal level of great writing.I was very disappointed.
5,Very entertaining!!!,This DVD is very entertaining! STP is one of my favorite bands & I definitely was not disappointed! High energy footage and enjoyed the interview with the band.
4,Almost perfect,"I'm going to start by saying I really wanted to give this 5 stars. Because this is the only STP DVD there is, I'd say go buy it if you want to see the band live. My only problem with this is the obvious over dubbing of the vocals and I'm not sure why. We all know that most things sound better in the studio than they do live but the energy is here. The band sounds great, the set list is fanstastic. Scott is flamboyant like a cross between Jagger and Bowie. So my problem is.....If you look really closely, there are times when the audio and video are not in sync and it drives me nuts. Why bother to show close up shots of Scott singing if it's not perfectly in sync with the music? The DVD does get better with this issue on the second half. All in all, go get it because it's the only one out there."
3,Surprise disgusting!,"I have nothing against homosexuality, but when you suddenly see that one of your favorite artists kisses another man ... was a bad surprise, not hate him for being gay. Beside, excellente"
5,Great Western!,"I gave this as a Christmas present and the recipient loved it! Johnny Mac Brown is awesome! He always defeats the villians. If you like old westerns made in the 1930's, then you will adore Johnny Mac Brown and his costars..."
1,Extremely frustrating,"It seems as though this book was thrown together over a weekend. Errors and omissions make it frustrating to use in the extreme. I should have been warned by the text on the inside back page that says, ""The CD-ROM ... contains a copy of Red Hat Linux 8.0..."". It doesn't of course and the installation that does come - 7.2 seems incomplete. For example I was unable to load the Samba server off the disks and the text that dealt with the installation was completely inaccurate and unhelpfull.This book is a waste of money - the official guide (downloadable free from Red Hat) is a better text and easier to read."
5,A arte de fazer caixas,"Ótimo, mas é necessario possuir uma pequena oficina, com o mínimo como serra circular, serra tico tico, etc. Muitos modelos, é bem detalhado. Monte sua oficina primeiro, depois compre ele e faa caixinhas belíssimas e bem acabadas (nada daquelas porcarias que vemos por aí)."
3,Title Tourny,"The title tournament, and at the time was fun watching to determine who would come out on top. The final was great with Ted Dibiase vs. Randy Savage with run ins by both Andre and Hulk. The battle royal was cool as those are always fun to watch. Overall, two many short matches to rate this one happen + Hogan didn't win!!"
2,WrestleMania IX is really WrestleMania 0,"This WrestleMania isn't really worth watching.The only good thing was that Hulk Hogan got eliminated although he made an appearance in the main event.They seem to celebrate Hogan more than the new champion Randy Savage.The tournament wasn't worth seeing,and the battle royal didn't mean much because Bret Hart destroyed the trophy.The IC and Tag Title Matches got boring fast.Watch a different WrestleMania,WWF Event,even a WCW Event,or Barney instead."
5,SSSSSWWWWWWEEEEEEETTTTTTTT,"This Wrestlemania is without a doubt, the best Wrestlemania in the history. Its got the Championship Tournament (much better than the Survivor Series one), a great match for the Tag Team Title, an okay match for Intercontinental Title, A sweet battle royal to kick it off, the 6 man tag team match was exciting, and the grudge match was exciting as well. Overall, this is a video worth buying."
3,One word: Loooooooooooooooooong,"It's 4 hours, so it does drag along at some points, but the tourney final with Savage and DiBiase is pretty good. The tag title match it okay. The Hulk/Andre rematch isn't good at all. Overall, it ain't bad, it's just long as all hell."
2,WrestleMania 4 & too much crud,"This PPV is crazy. I mean having a 14 man tournament,a 20 battle royal,a six man tag team match with Bobby Heenan in it and a messed up rematch Wrestlemania 3 rematch between Hulk Hogan & Andre The Giant all within 3 hours and within the same night? What were you thinking WWE? The Hogan-Andre utterly,totally,royally failed to live up to their WM3 match. Like ECW's first ONS event,the matches only lasted from 6 to 10 minutes with only the Jake Roberts-Rick Rude match lasting 15 minutes and that ended in a time limit draw and there were simply just too many matches in 1 night. While bring the first WM to have a tournament to crown a WWE championship it's still pretty forgettable. I give this PPV a 4 and a half out of 10."
4,Brill,"This event was a mamoth four hours long, even after being edited for home video release. It was the only WWF PAL tape that was released on 2 tapes as part of a box set. It featuered a tournament for the WWF World Heavyweight Title (all tourney matches are in Red). The other matchees weren't bad either, the 'Mania started off with a good battle royal which was a good gimmick opener. This Wrestlemania is fairly good, not as good as it's predecessor, but much better than the first two. This video is now avaliable on DVD as a Tagged Classics, and part of the Wrestlemania DVD Boxset."
1,pretty - but doesn't work,This is a pretty carafe but my half-and-half goes bad in it in about 2 days and I can't get the sour milk smell out! Also the lid design is bad - you get cream all over the ridges and they build up - yuck.**** The company is GREAT though. I sent it back and they are giving me a full refund. They tell me this hasn't happened with any other carafes and that they usually have good luck with these carafes. It really is pretty.
5,Great Service!!,Seller was very prompt in responding to shipping questions. Very polite. Products were in excellent condition.
2,Letterboxed,"This is a non-anamorphic format that presents the 1.78:1 aspect ratio in a letterbox, which means it will not display across the entire screen on some systems set up for pure digital video (i.e. using a HDMI cable)."
3,Nasty Bite,"This game, while not as hot as the movie was, provides a bit of fun. The controls are sometimes difficult to manage, and the difficulty level is fairly high. Blessedly, this game doesn't contain much in the way of puzzles like the RE series. Its basically, run, gun, pick up items here and there, gun....you get the picture. On a scale of 1-10, I'd say that Blade is somewhere around 6."
2,There is no life in Blade,"Blade isn't that old a game but it is amazing how uninteresting and uninnovative it is as a game. You expect nowadays that when a game is of the Lara Croft, Duke Nukem 3D, Quake genre that there would be at least a minimum of 1 new interesting feature in the game. E.g. in Spiderman you get to swing from building to building. Very cool. But in Blade you walk, you kill things. That's it. It never really gets more interesting. But you'd expect that at a minimum, Blade's character would have some kind of attitude! Nope- nadda! He's silent as a mouse until he dies. In fact even the zombies have more to say than he does.Also at the beginning of the game all you get is a pistol. Pardon me for being ignorant but isn't he called BLADE!"
5,WICKED WICKED WICKED!!,"I wanted to be the first to review these 2cd compilation just to big up Greensleeves records and to tell everyone how wicked this set is. 40 wicked tunes, all in the top 10 on the charts during their time, no fillers on this album. Big Up Greensleeves for providing this 1979-1982 set of when dancehall was in its purest form. Hit's like 'Shine Eye Gal', 'Firehouse Rock', 'Another One Bits the Dust', 'Gunman', 'Look How Me Sexy', 'Spar Wit Me' and that's just the first cd! If you're a fan of 80's dancehall or lover's rock don't hesitate to pick this one up. And it's only the price of a regular cd! Respect to Greensleeves!"
4,maybe 50% dancehall,"this is a good pick for those who love reggae music, and there are some early dancehall and chat tracks. But mostly its late 70's, early 80's reggae singers. To put Barrington Levy, John Holt and Johnny Osbourne on a 'strictly dancehall' comp seems ignorant...Still, i'd chek'et out."
1,The Real Truth About Tithing,"I took Barclays word for it, read his book and was submitted to one of his Pastors for 15 years. I also stayed broke for 20 yeras. After seeing no results (in addition to many others)following his teachings- 5 years ago I opened my Bible and did what it said- I have gone from 20,000 a year to 6 figures since. Heres the Real truth about tithing.[...]"
5,Very Informitive,"Five Stars! gets five stars from me. Tells you how to break down a movie ,write a synopsis ,and how to break into the business."
5,The Only One that Work's for Me !!,Yes It's true . This the Only (Over the counter)Pain Releif tablet's that Get Rid of My Mygrain Headache's.. I've tried others without any Relief..
3,interesting soundtrack,"This soundtrack sounds very unlike some of Shore's previous scores; it sounds closer to an ambient New Age album. Nearly every track features a sort of floating guitar which goes back and forth. The effect is very pleasing. This soundtrack also reminds me of driving music, which appropriately fits into the movie. My advice is to listen to clips before purchasing, because it may not impress everyone. I, however, found it to be a refreshing change in the world of soundtracks, and I am looking forward to more from Shore."
4,"So far,this is the Best Score of Howard Shore","I feel like driving (fast,fast) everytime i hear this.."
3,Huge but warm,"I purchased the 12-18 mo old ""infant"" costume and it was HUGE! My guy is on the low end of the spectrum being 12 months but still, it was massive. My 29 month old was just a tad too big for it. I bought the 2T Cookie Monster costume for him. There wasn't that much of a difference between the two costume sizes. Fortunately, I was able to roll up the the cuffs & sleeves two big rolls and it did the trick. It was very warm and my little guy was able to wear his sneakers and walk around."
2,Paid full price for USED costume,"I received the Elmo costume in the mail, and it was USED. I paid $49 and did not expect a used costume at this price. The package had been opened and the costume had stains on the Elmo eyes. The fur on the costume was matted down as well and looked like it might have been washed in a washing machine. It ran very small in size. My son is a very slender 2-year-old and we could barely zip it up. My son wore this to his preschool halloween party. The only reason I did not return this is that my 2-year-old son didn't know the difference, and neither did the other kids at the party. It should have been advertised as used and it should not have been $49."
5,Perfect for my 18th month old,"My son was 18 months when he wore this and it fit him perfectly, 50th percentile for height & weight. He was able to wear thin pj's underneath it."
4,Cute costume,"Nice costume and warm for the cooler weather. Only thing is the head and feet are a bit awkward, but it is very nice quality and adorable!"
4,Overall good purchase,"The hood tends to fall backwards often (maybe my daughter was just bouncing around too much). Also the hair does shed a bit on your clothes/furniture. However, very well made and appears to be warm for cold Halloween nights."
5,well made and cute,"Very pleased with this costume. It was well made and my son looked adorable. It is warm, maybe a little too warm for CA, but he was comfortable."
5,Just what we were looking for!,"This Elmo costume was just what we were looking for. After exhausting all of our local options for costumes and only finding top half costumes of Elmo, we finally found this one from someone's recommendation 1 1/2 weeks prior to Halloween. Finally a full length Elmo! This item was shipped quickly and was received with several days to spare. Top quality and keeps the little ones warm on Halloween evening. We will definitely come here first to look for a costume next year."
1,Runs Small and Is Itchy,Bought this item in a size 2T for my 18 month old son. Item was small and EXTREMELY itchy. He refused to wear it because it was scratchy. Elmo's eyes and nose do not sit properly to be seen on the head. Total waste of money and seller had ridiculous return policy with 30% restocking fee. Terrible experience.
5,My Favorite Chicks' CD Yet!,"Amazon.com never posted my review on this CD in which I said that it was stupid to not like a group because of their views, so I had to write it again. Maybe they'll post this one! OK, this CD is awesome. It's really good country. Being a non-country listener, it must be good if I like it! I think that the Dixie Chicks are very talented individuals and that their views should not be counted against them. It does not change the fact that this is awesome music! This is a highly recommended CD, and a great purchase! ENJOY!"
4,"An inventive curiosity, not a genre-sf piece","These three novels are set in a sprawling vertical conurbation named T-City, developed from Tyneside in the the North of England (to a local this can only seem ironic!). They are mainly a satire on the sixties, featuring social innovations like 'flicker knickers' and an ubiquitous building material called Stahlex. But the satire is indirect, and the novels are complicated slices through the lives of the inhabitants' sometimes mundance existences. Interesting and rather good, I wish he had written more."
1,What a rip off!,"I ordered this slipper in size 13 for my boyfriend who wears a 12 and would you believe that it was about 2"" too small. There seems to be some problem with the sizing."
5,As good as it gets,I am extremely happy with this paper. I use it with my Canon BJC8200 printer and the results are excellent. The only other paper that can compare is the Canon paper.Please note that it truly matters which software you use. I recommend trying out different software programs and experimenting to get the desired result. It can make a huge difference. I personally use the Kodak One touch software because I have a Kodak digital camera.
3,the Larry Clark Coloring Book....,"The collection of photographs in Larry Clark's Tulsa are undisputably one of the most important and compelling photo essays executed. The book itself, the soft cover version, was a disappointment when received. It felt more like a coloring book. Pay the extra money and buy this in hard cover."
3,Tulsa (Hardcover) - Larry Clark,"Paper looks good, photos look pretty good.Dust jacket looks crappy. Due to poor handling and also the type of material attracts oil and scratches easily."
2,Not any good,"I'm a big fan of DJ Sakin and Friends - Torsten Stenzel acted as producer for their magnificent progressive trance album Walk on Fire. DJ Sakin hasn't released a lot of new music lately, so I decided to purchase this Chillin' in Ibiza album and give Torsten a shot. Big mistake....the music is boring, the songs aren't any good....what more can I say?"
3,not as shown,very nice item great shipping speed just too bad it said that the chain was 18 inch chain and was shiped with a 16 inch chain instead. i guess this is buyer beware. but like i said very nice cant be worn but still very nice to look at.
5,Pretty awesome,"I have never heard of an awl before, but i needed to repair an awesome desk chair that I was not willing to part with. It's not easy to make the stitching beautiful (at least I don't stitch beautifully when using it), but it's an old chair, and thankfully it's black so I used black thread and a black patch and you can't even tell that it looks like a 10 year old did it :-)It's solidly made, seems like it would last a long time and a pretty nifty little tool. I like knowing I have it around to mend heavy fabrics even though I doubt I will get tons of use out of it."
5,The little tool that does so much,If you need to repair any canvas article this is the way to go. Easy to learn how to work the stitch. Best of all I was able to repair the canvas seating on my porch swing. Added some old blue jean patching sewed it all together with this tool it is now good as new. Saved me lots of money...
5,Good Solid Construction,"This handy little contraption saved me a couple hundred dollars for a new leather couch cover. It took some getting used to but when I did it worked great. There wasn't any issues with needles bending or anything because the design is simple and classic. If you don't mind a little work, save yourself the hundred dollars you would spend on a sewing machine that wouldn't even puncture leather, and buy this guy."
3,Where are the needles?,"I was ready to sit down to repair the leather soles on my slippers and then realized the awl didn't come with a needle. There was an iinsert telling me where I could buy some, but I was really disappointed that the needle was not included or that there was nothing on the site that told me that they were not included. Why would they not have included or at least be listed as an extra to be purchased. I assumed that the needles pictured with the unit were for it but they were hand needles. Bummer!I am an idiot. The needles were in the handle for anyone with a brain to find. The awl is ""awlsome."" I used it to replace the soles of my ""slipper socks"" and it worked wonderfully."
5,Great Product!!!!!,"Don't even bother with any other brand of this type product. Works on everything from light tarps to serious leather. I use it to fix rips, tears on my old MG top and tonneau cover."
4,Had one of these since b4 internet invented!!!,"I've had one of these for years and years, and used it over and over again for sewing lots of stuff out of tarpaulin and leather. It can be slow going on a long bit of stitching, but it really does the job well. Unfortunately I've now broken both the needles I had - I bought a smaller one for lighter sewing in a chandler's years back - now searching online for replacement needles ha ha ha let's see if the internet can do that!!Five minutes later - found replacement and alternative needles on marinestore.co.uk."
4,works well,this item works well and seems very durable. it came with 2 needles and alot of waxed thread on a spool.
5,will recomended,"It is what I want,will replace my old one,some one took it from my tool box,must advice in order to handle leather must have a ice pick,great for canvas and furniture"
1,Speedy stitcher,The picture is what I ordered and not what I received!! Very dissatisfied. I received a portable sewing machine instead. Not what I wanted.
5,Awesome multi-use tool,"I got an awl so I'd be able to repair canvas bags and heavy hunting clothes, but it's come in handy for a lot more things. I lost a little weight and I wanted to add a few notches to my belt: the awl is good for that. I ripped the edge of the pocket on my barn coat: the awl is good for that. One of the straps was coming loose on the duffel bag I use for laundry: the awl was good for that too. The needle doesn't look that strong at first glance, but it goes through tough canvas and even a fairly sturdy leather belt. I never felt like it was going to bend or break either.They're not expensive, and they come in handy in a lot of different ways. If you're not sure that you need an awl, you might as well drop the $10-13 because it'll probably be worth it."
3,Ok,Easy to set up and used. The needle broke when I used it to sew leather. I have not used it since so I cannot really say much. Maybe it was my fault the needle broke.
3,Does not work with iPod 30GB Photo.,This skin does not fit iPod 30GB Photo. It is loose on the iPod 30GB Photo. The plastic screen protector will not stay in place and will scratch your screen. I returned mine.
3,self-defeating plastic,"The screen protector with this iPod skin is a separate, loose piece of plastic that is supposedly held in place by the skin's edges. It doesn't really work. I found that the protector moved around quite a bit, and actually sratched my screen. I tossed it, and ended up having to buy the plastic film that adheres to the screen and click wheel, which cost another $15. In the end, I probably should have gone with the hard plastic case that offers total protection."
2,"NO, This is a great Book!","I must disagree with the previous review. This book may not rock, but it does rule! I am an Eagle scout and proud to be one! Yes, many of the quotes are way above the heads of most 11-year-olds. But don't you expect more from your son? A little encouragement from mom and dad will soon have the budding scout reading, and yes, enjoying this book. This book is the most comprehensive collection of quotes that not only pertain to the scouting ethos, but the lives we lead today as good Christians and members of the Jewish faith, which are vital to scouting. I highly recommend this, a truly superfluous and stunning collection of true words to live by. Long dead, but NOT forgotten!"
3,Complex,"The Book is very well written as are all Romesh Gunasekera's works, but it was a litle complex!!I was a little disappointed, by the conmplexity and the way the story was not properly blended!!"
2,Did I learn anything?,"This novel follows the lives of various Sri Lankan ex-pats in England and their intertwined family histories back home. While occasionally these types of novels strike a cord and manage to relate the cultural uniqueness of their country into our developed world context, this novel seemed to focus on a few spectacularly boring people and how they turned in and in on each other. My overwhelming emotion looking back on the book is disinterest. As far as I could figure, the characters could come from anywhere on the planet and be anywhere on the plant, and I will continue my search to get the feeling for Sri Lanka in some other book."
1,Hate mail from creator for returning defective product,"Ordered this product after seeing Joe Vitale at a seminar and watching the Wealth DVD.The product did not work with my DVD player. It's DVD-R technology and is known to not work with every player.Since it did not work I took advantage of the return option the company offers. It took them more than a week after getting the DVD back to confirm they did get it and apply the refund to my account. The day after I get the email confirming the refund I get the following email from Mark J. Ryan:""I figured you would do what you did..you can just feel the energy from certain people right awaySo predictable!""Amazing....I'm a big fan of Dr. Vitale but this experience makes me rethink that trust."
5,Great DVD!,These are great DVD's.Unfortunately AMAZON reviews has let the reviews get out of control.They have taken most of my positive reviews from legitimate folks down for some reasonand let stand negative ones.The review from K.C Sunshine says he has included in his review parts of a personal email from meHe never watched the DVD because he claims it never worked in his machine.But Amazon lets this reviewer stay????And he is posting my personal email contents on AMAZON and he admits he never watched it???What kinds of shenanigans is Amazon playing here? Are they playing favorites? Or worse?They have proven not to respect peoples material with their rating system.
5,Wonderful Replica!,"I bought this sword for my 14 year old godson, who would love a real replica, but who has younger siblings so a sharp steel replica is not an option.He absolutely loved it! I was amazed at how good it looks up close, and actually wished I had bought another one for myself!"
5,my Favorite sward,When I opened the package I was stuned. I knew that the sward would glow and so I thought it would be made of plastic and look like plastic. I was excited that it is made of plastic but it has a real metal look. It shines and shimmers. then when you put the bateries in and turn it on it looks like a real sward glowing. I think this is a totaly awsome live memory of the movie and books. A great gift for any fan.
4,Great sample of Indian Classical Music,"This was released quite a while ago in Switzerland, with the title 'An introduction to Indian classical music'. This album five different Ragas.It starts with the sound of Tampura (drone instrument) which sets the mood of Marwa. Marwa is full of pathos, and it is brilliant on Santoor.Then there are three short pieces -- Rag Hameer, Rag Kamod, and Rag Kedar. The listener will be surprised to see how quickly the maestro sets the mood of the Raga. Rag Hameer is one such example where the starting phrase - lasting less than 5 seconds - sets the mood of Hameer which is devotional.It is rare to hear Hameer and Kamod on the Santoor.The last track has Bhinna Shadaj which is a light and romantic raga. It ends with a fast tempo composition.This is a very good album for folks who are new to Indian classical music. The tabla accompaniment by Zakir Hussain is excellent.HPR"
5,Beyond fabulous!,"I've always loved the movie (with Jennifer Jones and Joseph Cotten), but the book is a hundred times better! Robert Nathan 's works should be required reading in every high school and college!"
3,Pretty Good,It was a good action movie great colors and a great fantasy movie. Good for Kids and Adults.
5,Everything you need for a thrilling movie with the kids,"We had a great time with the kids for a family evening. We love the movie especially ""Shenanshel"" the Magical Turtle. What an actor so convincing and so real the Kids love the fantasy of the entire movie and highly recommended just an evening with the family, as for the Court Turtle Shenanshel, I give the actor ten stars for the excellant portrayal of the turtle."
3,An Abridged version of the TV mini-series recorded at EP,"When I first saw this mini-series to the Odyssey channel I fell in love with it. Please understand that the low rating not because of the full mini-series, but it is because of removal of 40 to 60 minutes plot. On top of which they add insult to injury they record it on extended play (EP) to fit the 132 min. ABRIDGED version (the original was over 180 min. long) on a 30 min. tape. None of which I might add is explained in the description of the product. So what I bought and what thought I was getting where two different things. I hope in the future the will correct this because as it currently stands you are not getting the full enjoyment of ""Voyage Of The Unicorn""."
1,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible!","Did I mention that this movie was terrible? Cheesy clunky script, idiotic premise, bad acting, unbelievable sets (except for the ones on the actual Unicorn). And since when does a fairy have vampire teeth? Really, I would avoid this movie and get some of the Hallmark miniseries. Much better quality!"
5,Simply amazing,"Sepiamusic is not the new new. They are not a trend nor a genre of music to be defined or categorized. The lyrics are pure poetry. The music is a mix of, past, present and future from an amazing array of genres all mixed into a outpouring of expression and emotion. the result is very memorable audio that stays with you even in your sleep. I never felt this way about music before. It's scary how strong this album is, it is very powerful."
5,Haunting and beautiful.,"I can't stop myself from listening to this wonderful collection, over and over again. Rebecca Pidgeon is a rare treasure. Her voice has a sweet and haunting quality that will reach straight into your heart. The arrangements are splendid. I particularly enjoyed Ms. Pidgeon's personal liner notes on the songs, giving attribution and a brief history for each. Simply one of the best albums ever."
1,So dissapointed,"So I read the other reviews before I bought this album, I looked at the play list -- looked good. Unfortunately my speakers weren't working so I couldn't listen to the selections, but I thought I'd take a chance. Pidgeon could have a nice voice, but for some reason she insists on a nasaly twang that sounds more hill-billy than Scots. It's like nails on a chalkboard. If you want good, authentic, Scottish folk music listen to Jean Redpath's First Flight. There's no comparison."
5,.,"this book was beautiful. I am not sure what experiences it takes to be hit by this book--not everyone likes it as much as me. athletics, probably, and years of competition--this book resounded to my memories of these things. but of course I recommend it to anyone. and it is also, I have no doubt, the basis for the movie Rocky."
1,mislabeled,"I purchased this memory recently... though it did work in my PC, it's actually 2- 512MB strips (1 GB total, not 2GB)."
5,Works with ASUS P5P800-VM and Intel Pentium D930 CPU,"Pros: They work. Feel sturdy, as compared to manufacturers that use a cheaper PCB. Good price for 1gig of memory.Cons: None, so far.Other Thoughts: I bought this to go with my new Pentium D 930 and an ASUS P5P800-VM mobo. BUT, after installing everything I noticed that these sticks of mem' are NOT on ASUS's ""DDR Qualified Vendors List"". Now, Kingston IS on the list, but not this model #. It would be helpful to know this BEFORE I bought it all and opened it. Anyway, it's been in my system and working flawlessly for a year now... they work great."
3,works well... after some problems,well... works well... after some hickups. At first computer crashed . i re-installad the memory... crashed again. third time lucky
2,Make Sure You Select the Right Memory for Your Application,"I have an Intel D865PERL MBO that requires matched sets of memory to run the Dual Channel with Dynamic Mode (DCDM) feature. I contacted Intel and Kingston about the use of two ""/1R"" modules versus a two module ""/2G"" set. They both said that the former are individual modules and their is no guarantee that two modules purchased at random will be sufficiently matched to permit the DCDM feature and the later are pre-matched at the factory prior to packaging to assure that they will support an application feature such as DCDM. The ""R"" suffix to the Kingston part ID signifies retail packaging - no real clue there. If you want the DCDM feature (the best performance), use the matched pair of modules - it does cost a bit more (~50%), but it is guaranteed to work whereas a pair of the individual ""R"" modules may or may not satisfy the Intel requirements for the DCDM feature, not a prudent gamble. Kingston is good memory."
2,Eh,"I bought this thinking that it would be as sexy as Realm for men, but i've been disappointed in that. it smells ok, but not nearly as good as the masculine alternative."
5,easy smoothand complete,"metwrench the best tools i have ever used have not be able to break any socket with 1/2 in or 3/8in impactsnot even a 4 foot cheater pipe would not damage the 3/8""' drive sockets i am very proud of my tools this was mysecond set a thief feltmy 1st set of metwrech was good enough for him so i ordered and recieved a larger setthen the 1st for my self still real proud of my my metrench i believe in their grip on a rounded damaged nut and boltsthey are the best for me"
4,cheaper on the official web site,"used these tools for 12 years & only broke the ratchet & the 1/4 - 3/8 adapter, though I had a cheater pipe on them. I just bought a craftsman to replace it. i still use them almost every day for my business. have a set for each work truck, personal vehicles & the shop. they ARE worth the $. @ [...], the official metrinch web site, this set is only $399.99, $50 less than on amazon"
2,Costs too much - the TV version was 70% less.,"There is no durable competitive advanteage here. This product and all Metrinch products Costs too much - the TV version was 70% less. I know, I bought mine from the TV phase of marketing and there are no US dealers from the website - [...]Until they get real on their prices instead of overhype and have a strong US dealership organization to back it up - I would be very cautious.Yes the product does what they claim - but the service, the follow up and the value is not there yet - this is just more MLM hype."
5,Great Book!,"Great book to read along with your children! I love the ""We Both Read"" books, which give the opportunity for you to read to your child and your child read to you!"
3,Incomplete,"This is a nice set, and Hoppes is a good brand. Still, for a universal kit, it ought to have brushes big enough more manly calibers such as .40 S&W or .45 ACP. With this kit, if you have any handgun bigger than a weenie 9mm, it looks like you're out of luck."
5,Top quality Magnesium,"I've been using this brand and type of magnesium for almost a year now and have had no issues with it. It's really helped me with my anxiety and just overall health. It also helped my dad with his trigger finger problem. He felt he was very close to having it operated on. Well taking these for about 2 months gave him great relief and it has almost disappeared! Do your homework. Not all magnesium is built the same. Best types to take are citrate, taurate and chloride (which is usually an oil or water really that you apply on the skin). There are some other okay ones but better to use the best. I would highly recommend this brand as they have a solid reputation."
5,Magnificent! Cured my skipped heart beats!,"After a long period of stress at work, I began to experience skipped heartbeats. After some research I decided to try this product. I have been using it for about 3 months now and the skipped heartbeats are 99% gone. The only exceptions have been when I've been very stressed out, or when I've had multiple espressos in a day. This is a fantastic product that I can't recommend highly enough!"
5,Wow,"This stuff calms me way down. I feel like there is nothing that can bother me when I get enough magnesium, and magnesium taurate delivers it so much better than any other form. This stuff is like magic. Anyone else feel this mellow from taking this?"
2,Muscle Cramp/Spasm,"I am taking Magnesium taurate for about one month now and unfortunately I am facing a problem regarding muscle cramps/Spasms with magnesium Taurate!I can never forget the first day I took this product. I woke up in the morning and realized the spasms in most of my muscles specially my Thigh! The problem exists now!I take one capsule of Magnesium Taurate in the night because after taking it, I get a kind of sleepy. Also waking up in the morning is not so easy for me in comparison to the time I don't take it!I am also taking enough Vitamin D as an extra supplement.It is strange because I don't have this problem when I use Magnesium Malate supplement!"
4,Magnesium Taurate,I'm happy with the product - no side effects. It came highly recommended by a local pharmacist. Because Magnesium is important I decided to try a recommended product and I will order again.
5,Magnesium in a well-assimilated form,My doctor recommends magnesium taurate and Cardiovascular Research provides them online with 125mg. These work well. Now I will keep typing so that this review will qualify for 20words.
2,read ingredients carefully,"The list of ingredients on the product description neglects to include gelatin as the second ingredient. I don't use gelatin as most is animal-based and listing it would have been helpful in making the decision on whether buy the product. I take some responsibility since those that do not include it usually say veg cap. However, it can be overlooked and should be clearly stated. I will have to decant the product and hope it is not too unpalatable. I won't re-order."
3,Did not meet Expectations,"I did alot of research online for Pressure Washer. I really wanted the K 5.93 model of Karcher, but it was out of stock in every store (online and local). So, I bought this model. It costs more, so I figured it might even be better. I can't say whether or not it's better than the K5.93 model, but I can say that it did not meet my expectation. The pressure is not as strong as I had expected. I used it to clean my car. It didn't clean very well. I don't recommend it for the price. $200 would be a more reasonal and fair price for this item."
4,"Actually, 3 and a half stars","I dearly love this great opera, which I consider one of the pinnacles of French music. It's a tough one to pull off for many reasons, and all of the six or seven versions I've heard have weaknesses in one area or another.My benchmark for Les Troyens is the gorgeous love duet """"Nuits d'ivresse"" in Act 4. The singing here is very good, but Pretre conducts it much too quickly and spoils the whole effect. The piece should flow, throbbing with both erotic ardor and erotic lassitude as it unfolds. Here it just sounds rushed. And speeds are bit bit brisk throughout. My all-time favorite for this duet is sung by Regine Crespin and Guy Chauvet on a 2-LP abridged set from the early 1960s, oddly enough also conducted by Pretre. Perhaps La Crespin fixed him with a steely glare and said ""Slow down, Georges!"" Nonethless there are many worthy moments in this recording, particularly when drama is required."
4,Another Mind-Blowing Grifters Gem,"Here's the first truly killer grifters albumor cd. Bought this thing like five differenttimes. So damn good. From opening rockerBummer to She blows Blastic of Static tospacey Sain/The Casual Years these guys areallovertheroad in the best possible way.Trippy songs, trippy lyrics featuring bassby a guy named Trip Lamkins. Ridiculouslygreat band, live and on tape, sounds lo-fibut One sock was the beginning of a bigger,louder sound for the Grifters. Culminatingin the amazing Crappn' You Negative whichfollowed the next year i believe on themighty Mephis label Shangri-La, a labelGBv-man Tobin Sprout later wrote a songabout. Four & a half-stars for rare beauty& serious four-on-the-floor four pieceStones-y rockn'roll."
3,"Larnelle, PASS THE LOVE","This CD takes a different approach from the other works released from Larnelle, which is somewhat expected after an artist has released many works. The music is more soulful and jazzy, especially in songs like ""You Delivered Me"" and ""In His Name."" The music-styling is still spiritual, just presented in a different vein from Larnelle's past work. Once I accepted that ""Pass the Love"" is a departure from Larnelle's norm, I became more appreciative of the new sound."
4,It will do for now,"I read reviews on this DVD Upconvert player thought it would be a good match with my new Samsung 56 inch DLP. They work well together , but not quite the picture quality I had hoped for from the player. This I will live with ,like many others ,until this dumb HD Bluray battle has gone its course."
4,Nice Antenna,"The antenna works as advertised. I installed it on the edge of my roof rather than in my attic to ensure the best possible reception. It works great without an amplifier.Installation was difficult because I had to go to the hardware store to get the necessary parts to mount it. (I was expecting a complete kit; it did not include a mounting rod.) I would have had the same issue if I mounted it in my attic. I can't really complain because it cost only $35 with tax and shipping.Overall, I recommend this antenna to anyone who needs a directional antenna."
1,not getting VHF,"I dont know how this product is getting such high rating and reviews, I am not getting any VHF channels on this, I tried all the directions and the boosters."
4,Suprisingly good Antenna,"Funny, I moved to the city a long time ago and threw out my analog antenna a long time ago. Now with digital TV, I need an antenna again. I did not think much of this antenna when I bought it, I was just looking for something to let me get a few of the digital stations. I installed it on the roof and whammo all of the stations came in (most @~ 70% strength). It looks flimsy out of the box and I was worried about it falling down but it has survived a few nasty wind storms and has not moved an inch. I also hooked my receiver up to this antenna and it improved my FM singnal a bit (although this is clearly not an FM antenna). I bought this in combo with the Winegard DS-1111 that fits right on to the back of my Sat dish. Pretty easy to install for the semi-handy guy."
2,design flaw experianced,"I am in Chicago wher there is a channel 20 broadcasting DTV on channel 21. I receive all channels with this antenna except channel 21. Th antenna delivers most of the channels from the same transmitter location as channel 21, so the aim is correct. It is relatively blind to this channel only. I just had the cables and connections replaced by an installer to make certain that everything else was OK"
5,Improved Reception,We were having trouble getting over the air channels with the cheap little rabbit ears we had hooked up to our new HDTV. We bought this and an antenna mount and attached it to our satellite dish and now we get all the channels in crystal clear. Well worth the money we spent.
4,Channel Master Antenna,"Channel Master 3010 Outdoor Rooftop UHF/VHF/FM HDTV AntennaI am using this antenna with the optional amplifier, indoors at street level. It is being used in conjunction with the Channel Master digital/analog converter. It picks up my local channels with no problems and presents a beautiful picture. Only have this for a short time, but am very satisfied with its performance."
2,Bad choice,"Oh, gullible me. Channel Master does not show its CE Antenna color code for this 3010 antenna on its web page, but advertises it as ""range up to 45 miles"". I needed a ""red"" directional antenna for my stations, most of which are 20 miles away, and thought ""45 miles"" meant ""red"" or ""violet"". I got suckered. As shown on the box, the 3010 is a ""green"", low-gain antenna that works only in strong signal areas. It fails to pick up most of my stations. Next time I will avoid Channel Master, which hides its specifications and advertises hype, in favor of a reputable manufacturer like Winegard,Winegard HD7015 VHF/UHF/FM Prostar 1000 TV Antenna (HD-7015). They least they tell you their gain, beam width and CE color codes."
1,OUTDOOR ANTENNA DOES NOT WORK,The antenna does not work at all. I hook it to my converter box and get nothing!!! I hook it straight to the TV and I get nothing!!!!With my rabbit ears I currently get 10 channels clear as a bell. I am supposed to get 4 digital channels but get nothing with this antenna.I have rotated it in every direction and I am less than 20 miles from the transmitters.I rated this antenna with 1 star because it would not let me rate it any lower.VERY VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT
3,Works Good,"I recently purchased this antenna so I can receive over the air digital local channels. It does a very good job pulling in local digital channels in the Phoenix area but the standard analong channels do not come in very clear. I have been receiving almost a full signal on the digital channels per my HDTV's signal meter. The manufacturer recommends the addition of an optional amplifier to improve the signal. I have not yet ordered the amplifier but after reading a review by another owner on Epinions, he states it works very good with the addition of the amplifier."
5,A great how to manual,"For those thinking about treading the water as a trading company or for those who work in the industry, this book is absolutely superb at offering specific case studies and detailed resolutions for each case. It includes even the faxes and email communications that happened verbatim, and certainly gives one a level of understanding of the complexity involved in moving goods between countries. Worth the time for anyone interested in international trade."
5,DOO WOP ALIVE AGAIN...........,AHHHH ENJOYED MUSIC OF MY ERA COME TO LIFE AGAIN.........FANTASTIC GLAD I HAVE IT TO WATCH AND LISTEN TO IF YOU LIKE THE DOO WOP MUSIC BUY THIS YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT...........
2,artist and description,"I have been on the site all day trying to see who is on the DVD and what songs. very confusing site, CDs and DVs are mixed at times.Shoud be clear as to songs and artist, would be great if listed below each album along with song. We should be be able to listen to excerpts from each. I found a couple that offered 30 second clips and haven't been able to find that same clip again.Again confusing, lets make this simpler, I bought one and would have made my second purchase earlier if I could locate it."
5,WIL'S MUSIC IS THE BEST!,"This EP will impress anyone that likes good music! The Wil Seabrook Band is like none you've heard before. Not only does Wil have the most beautiful voice in the music industry, but his talent continues into his great lyrics and music he writes as well! Buy this EP!!~You won't be sorry...buy some for gifts for family and friends as well. They will thank you for introducing them to some really good music!Austin Texas Loves You Wil! :)"
1,Weak G Rated TV Sci-Fi,"Low budget made for TV movie with very little creativity for Alien design. Extremely poor acting for the most part, but... new talent has to start somewhere.ThomasPS: I've seen Stephen Cannell do much better work... this was a let down."
2,Just enough to entertain for the budget buck!,I expected a light entertainment with minimal intelligence....and Yep you guessed it....I wasn't disappointed. A Sunday afternoon flick of some interest ....for the price even shipped to N.Z it was value....better than a lot of the `B' through `Z' grades I have brought. Good image and sound
4,Very Vanilla,"I purchased this to add to our morning smoothies. The vanilla flavor is a bit strong, but it is not bad. For the price, it is a good protein powder."
5,Music you will remember!,"I enjoyed this trememdously. I will guess that the person from Arizona is probably from the sixties. Nonetheless, it shows the closed mindedness of that era that is still prominent today. I am a Chicana and never once thought that she was like Helen Reddy.I will agree that the ""General Hospital"" story was not necessary but it does not detract from the rest of the concert. There is no denying that God gave her much talent and she was and still is very entertaining. I sang and hummed these songs for weeks after the concert. I was there at the Greek Theater that night.I no longer have the record album and I plan on buying the CD so thank you Amazon making this available and bringing it back."
5,Enjoy Live!,"I enjoyed Vikki's concert in Nagoya,Japan about 30 years ago. It was the very splendid. This CD also offers Charm of superstar Vikki. Anyway, she is GREAT.I have LP RECORD of this concert, and then I obtained this CD, and it is my important treasure both."
5,Priceless Knowledge,"If you want to get the very best knowledge ever about behavior, human or animal, that you can possibly find in one succinct book, you have found the goldmine. Yes, you can get this book much cheaper, you can buy this book for $25.00 at the Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies. The knowledge contained in this book is worth trillions; it's worth the future of mankind. You can learn more from this one book than you will learn in lifetimes of college, business or life. Everyone should read this book; it's a lifesaver."
3,Good but short,"My comments for Lucinda's Secret, volume three of the Spiderwick Chronicles are the same as the first two volumes: the stories are well written, with excellent illustrations, but each volume on its own is much too short. The series really would work better as a single book."
2,Poor imitation of the real thing,"These wouldn't be so bad if the publishing company hadn't completely tried to cash in on the Harry Potter craze with the marketing and covers of these books. My kids dig these but not with the burning passion they (and I) reserve for the H.P. books. A nice diversion until the next H.P. book comes out, but probably forgettable in the long run."
4,Another great installment,"In Lucinda's Secret we find the Grace children nursing a griffen back to health in the barn, Jared still suffering from the pranks of the house Brownie, and continued questions and secrets surrounding Uncle Arthur and the faerie world. They decide to visit their Aunt Lucinda in the sanitarium to see if she can provide any answers to these questions. She is able to give them a glimpse into the disappearance of her father, their Uncle Arthur. This leads them on another magical adventure in the area surrounding the Spiderwick Estate as they follow a map that could only have been made by Arthur himself.This is anoher fun installment in the Spiderwick series. The Grace children continue to rely on each other and use their clever wits to get them out of problem situations as they encounter magical creatures. Some of the other fantasy series out there have a bit more depth to them, but this is a charming series with a lot of fun."
4,"Best yet, but still missing something","This was by far the best of the Spidewick Chronicles. Less action, to be sure, but the backstory is very important here as it is in The Series of Unfortunate Events. Though not as entertaining as the latter, it introduces us to some very interesting characters.Aunt Lucinda made this book for me. Had she not been here, I would have given up on the series entirely. Maybe I just have a strange love of eccentrics in books, but she was awesome.That said, since I can't remember the plot of the book very well, the action was not very memorable. Still, it was a good read for the hour it took to read the book."
4,spiderwick a quick read,"The story is fast moving, but a very quick read! Less then a day in my house!"
5,don't want it to end!,the meeting with Aunt Lucinda was not as productive as I had hoped but I still am in awe with the saving of the griffin and what are those elves up to? I just can't put these books down :)
3,Sneaky,1) The book is about three childeren trying to destroy a book but one of the childeren dosn't want to destroy the book he thinks it is important so they go to see the great anut about the book but what they found out about the book was more than the knew.2) It was a good book could have had more action thougth.3) Irony all through the story they have twists they thought there grandma know about the faries they thought she didn't in it.4) I gave this book a 3 stars because it didn't have enough action and i recommed this book to all the fantsy fiction lovers.
1,Sand and Steel: The Classic Sound of Jamaican Steel Bands,"The audio quality on this CD is the worst that I have ever heard on any CD I have ever listened to in my life. It is, in my opinion, a waist of money. This CD dosen't rate ONE STAR."
2,Too many characters to keep track of.,"Charlie Greene's mother is the prime suspect in the murder of her next door neighbor, and there are more murders to follow. The actual storyline wasn't very captivating, but the big cast of characters kept your brain turning. The major downside to this book was that this was Charlie's first visit home to Boulder since she left sixteen years ago as a pregnant teen. The mystery of who fathered Charlie's daughter, Libby, almost took top billing over what was supposed to be the actual mystery. The book was okay--it makes for a light weekend read."
4,He's a softy,"I got this toy for a friend who loves koalas. It's smaller then I thought, but other then that it's great. Very soft and cute."
5,Best one Yet,"First of all I am a hardcore Tourniquet fan and these guys are one of the few bands that are still putting true metal albums out, not that nu metal turds. This album is by far their most dynamic yet. The opening track is over seven minutes and is relentless. Healing waters of the Tigris is a nine minutes epic, that is just completely awesome. This track shows just how talented this band is. Marty Friedman (Megadeth) lays downs most of the guitar tracks on this album and burns. THis is a very diverse metall album that ranges from thrash to speed to a 70s influenced metal. THe last track on this album is quite unique in that no bass guitar was used!! Whether or not you are a Christian this is a must have for any fan of true metal. This album is their best yet and well worth any cost."
3,good but had writing inside cover,"This item was received quickly and in the condition as described; however, there was a signature inside the front cover, and since we wanted to get this signed by the author, it will present a problem when presenting the book. If I had known, I would have chosen a different seller to receive a book that wasn't signed by anyone."
3,Not sure if this is such a great product,"It doesn't come with the best of directions, you'll need to look around for me info.It seems to work pretty good if you want a regular DVD writer. Except like another individual I'm not to pleased with the video card installed. It doesn't work right out of the box. I still don't have it working 100%. I start getting video and then I get an error and it won't ""Could not complete last command because: Access Violation - No RTTI data!"" and it stops playing the video. Tried two differnt input, camcorder and VCR both with same results.Anyone know what I'm doing wrong contact me. I'm tried various settings and followed limited directions given. To no avail.Michael BridgesIf I figure this out, I'll post another reply."
1,Don't Buy-Junk,"I have had vey good luck with Iomega products in the past, but this unit does not work as advertised. Admittedly one can burn DVD's from files already present on your HD, but the built-in video capture card does not work. I have tried it with two VCR's and it simply won't capture the video out signal. It may be a software glitch, but I'm not about to spend more $ on a separate viedo capture card and aditional software to make this burner work, If your primarily interested in transferring VCR tape to DVD, buy a stand alone unit- I did and and it works flawlessly."
1,Skip it,"This is probably the movie that ended Mark Hamil as an actor of any note. Hollywood, Hamil and Marvin have probably regretted this one for the past 30 years. There is no story-line or anything resembling a plot. The film changes from one scene to the next without any sense of transition. The scene where we couldn't take anymore was when the Marvin character shows up at the beach in bedouin attire, his men see him and suddenly this grand-reunion-type music starts playing as his men run up to greet him. But why? There had been virtually no character development to this point. I had thought this was one of the great WWII flicks that I'd neglected. It wasn't."
4,A fun to read book about God and happiness,"With the use of fish as teaching tools for real life, I found a humorous, easy and fulfilling way to identify with how to be a good person and a true Christian without the guilt. The honesty in this book allowed me to evaluate my life and discover that the answers to my spiritual questions were clearly laid out in this book. Not only is it comforting and complete, I chose to read it quickly in order to find the answers to my questions. If you are concerned about your relationship with Christianity or have a spiritual question about it then this is the book for you."
3,It's a Start...,"Heitzman's 2003 review of sports-related career opportunities is kind of like the rides in the traveling carnivals that come to small towns: it's not a great ride but it's better than nothing. Essentially, this is a resource book that has its list of other resources as its best feature. The writing is straight forward and not particularly engaging but it quickly sets out a good bit of information. It addresses nine areas, including entrepreneurship and a collection chapter of miscellaneous careers. It includes guidelines for preparing for each career type and provides numerous lists such as duties, organizations, etc. The book's primary usefulness is in identifying several potential areas and then furnishing ideas of ""what to do next.""For a much more comprehensive treatment, I'd recommendThe Comprehensive Guide to Careers in SportsFor a more dated but more interesting look at five specific sports careers, tryCareers w/o College: Sports (Careers Without College)"
3,Jones' later recordings -- NOT -- the early sixties.,"(These comments are for the c.d. with Jones wearing a green sweater on the front cover.""Jimmy Jones"" is red type, & ""Handy man"" is blue type)These 16 tracks of Jimmy Jones are mostly the late sixties and early seventies R&B; sound.This C.D. has some O.K. songs, and there is one hit ""Handy man"".But if you're looking for his sixties hits, b-sides, album cuts, or early sixties sound,this isn't the place to find it.Jones continued to record into the early seventies, and had his own label.This 2009 release is on ""Vanilla"" label omp.Jones had a great voice, and had 4 songs chart between 1959 and 1961.1.""Handy man"" -- top ten hit.2.""Good timin"" -- top ten hit.3.""That's when I cried"" -- didn't chart well, but it's a great song.4.""I told you so"" -- didn't chart well, but it's a good 60's song."
3,Let's Not Go Crazy: This CD's Okay,"Based on the glowing reviews here, I bought the ""red sweater"" version of ""Handy Man"" by Jimmy Jones. It claims to be on a 1993 version of the original CUB label but there's no BAR CODE or other company information, the sign of a ""grey market"" CD. And, yes, there is SOME stereo here but just as many hits were in MONO. Most distressing, several minor hits were copied from VG- vinyl records! So, it's possibly the best thing out there right now but, with the passing of Mr. Jones, I hope something better comes along."
4,Nice restoration....great looking film,"Wow, this is what i called restored. Great job. The movie looks like itwas just made a few years ago. We have action, monsters, Cesar Romeroas the bad guy...he's good at that and so many things that makes thismovie enjoyable to the end. It looks better now than when i saw it ...manymany years ago. Its a Keeper. Enjoy"
3,lat 0,"1st 3/4 of film very boring-lil or no plain action. the last 1/4 of film-shows lg.: bats, rats & a lion & just ok fx."
2,Ineptitude Zero,"I enjoy Japanese monster movies and retro-cheesy model effects as much as anybody. BUT, I only recommend this DVD if you're in the mood to fast forward - a lot - to get to the few fun parts which comprise the final 15 minutes of the movie. Cesar Romero is creating giant fuzzy bat men in an underwater utopia. Cesar Romero also has an evil shark-shaped submarine with a laser cannon. That's all in the final act, and that's about it for the fun. If you can find this used, and cheap, it's worth a few chuckles...but certainly not repeated viewing."
4,"Good, but if this is the way Salvatore now writes....","Then I MIGHT give up. There was 130-140 pages of the battle, like The Legacy. Drizzt is kind of dropping on charecter development. But, Regis and Catti-brie are devolping. I love the part where Harkle misplaces his eyes(It's hard to explain if you haven't read it), and ERRTU IS BACK! YEA! Artemis took a break on this book (Thank god foor that. He's been in all the Drizzt books sinse Streams...)All in all, a very good book. Oh, the plot is that Matron Banere plans to seek revenge on Drizzt and start a war at Mithrall Hall. Drizzt and company must stop the Drows. Also, Errtu is getting help from Lloth(Yes, Lloth) on getting out of his banishment. That pretty much sums it up. END!"
3,this book drew me into fantasy,"this was the first fantasy novel I read, since then I have read dragonlance riftwar wheel of time tolkien, you name it. there are better novels out there but this fun."
4,Typical of R.A. Salvatore,I do not have much to say about this book but that it is good. It is typical work of R.A. Salvatore. I definately recommend it.
4,Outstanding Writing,"NO SPOILERS!In SEIGE OF DARKNESS, Salvatore takes a step back from the cover-to-cover relentless battle scenes to spend more time with the supporting characters, particularly those in the chaotic Menzoberanzan. The power struggle is on between the top five houses following the gruesome defeat to Drizzt, Cattie-brie and the contributions of Entreri in the previous novel, STARLESS NIGHT. Meanwhile, the confusing relationship between Drizzt and Cattie-brie continues to take point in the plot. With SEIGE, Salvatore demonstrates his remarkable versatility as a writer. Rather than churning out formulaic battle-driven novels time and time again, he develops the story into a Saga; one in which the characters emotions come alive as much as their swordplay. For those who feast on the action, fear not, you'll get your fix in SEIGE. Overall, an outstanding addition to the saga."
4,Good Book Torn Between Epic and Intimate,"""Siege of Darkness"" is one of the more unique books in the Drizzt series. R.A. Salavtore does a fairly credible job in balancing between the epic confrontation between dark elves and dwarves with the tale of Drizzt and his friends. Salvatore does a very good job in laying out the geography and the various units of both armies. How the impending crisis affects his heroes ranks as one of Salvatore's best efforts in character development (high praise indeed since it is one of Salvatore's strengths). And yet....there is something akin to disappointment in the final battle. Salvatore had spent the better part of two previous books building up to this moment. While it is a solid battle scene, one is struck by how anti-climatic it seems. Despite this letdown, this a fine addition to the Drizzt books."
4,The return of the evil drow,"This is the 3rd book in ""The Legacy of the Drow"" series. In this book the evil drow city finally plans a good attack against the Drizzt and his friends. The war that was started in ""The Legacy"" continues, but now the biggest battle begins. The Drow make it to the surface and all hell has broken loose. The evil spider queen is now living only to see the traitor Drizzt dead. The Drow now flow to the surface and attack where the companions of the hall least expect it. From under them. Now the drow flow to the surface and make an attack that few will get out of. This is a must have for the series and for any fan of Drizzt or the Drow. Dont miss this great part of the series."
4,A dazzling display of the talent of Salvatore once more,"This book the best out of all nine of the Forgotten Realms books I have had the privilege of reading. All have been great but not nearly as phenomenal as the feeling I got as the last page was turned in this fantastic story. Once again R.A. Salvatore has placed you in the danger, suspense, and utter excitement of one of his books once more. The deeper revelations about some of the characters kept me guessing throughout this masterful telling of a (dare I say it again) phenomenal story."
2,Not really great overall.,"But that one song that I wanted off this CD made it worth it, but it never came in the mail, so..."
3,Dramas for Bible School,I wish I had had athe opportunity to see more of a Table of Contents and inside content so I could know ahead what I might be able to use.
4,Pretty Good Fill station,"The Black N2 fill station works pretty well. It leaked air from around the gauge fitting, but I was able to fix that with some plumber tape. Ultimate Paintball refunded my shipping cost, so in the end it worked out well.I bought a 80 cu tank at the local dive shop and brought the fill station along with me, and the guy helped me fill my first tank. Works really well. Very easy to do. Much easier then filling co2 tanks. HPA works much better then co2, especially in the winter."
4,PSI Scuba fill station,"PSI Scuba fill station came as advertised. Shiping was quick during the busy holiday season. The fill station is easy to use and saves me alot of money on tank refills. Dose not come with any type of instructions, so you will have to look up how to fill your tank on-line."
2,Field Owner,I assumed this product would work with all HPA tanks but it doesn't. O'ring is having to be replaced on every 4 refills. Not very impressed.
1,Junk!!!,"""The Filling Station you sent me had a ""Factory Defect""!!! The Female Nozzle wasn't ""cut"" correctly...No N2 Bottles Fit on it! It was a real piece of Junk! I WILL NEVER purchase anything from you again. What a waste of time and Money. I was better off buying a Filling Station from my Pro-Shop to begin with. I was trying to save Money. I had to buy another one. Thanks for nothing! """
2,Great price but,"Great price but started having issues with air leaks after 3 fills. Joints are in perfect conditions though.Never had that kind of trouble with another brand i owned.Update : Joints are in good condition, but air still leaks, looks like joint on entry feed is too small and lets air pass."
5,No more CO2,Air tanks are great and we can play anytime. Scuba diver with lots of air tanks so this was a no brainer. You don't really need the extension hose but it makes filling easier.
1,Waste of money,"This is the worst filler i ever had. Use it once at 2000 psi, blow my low 1800K pressure disc and the filer O-ring's had to be replaced on the filler. Not going to get any of these cheap fillers. I rather to spend a little more to get something of super high quality and durable than that.DINYOKE Paint Ball Filler allows for sure 4500 PSI and 3000 PSI."
4,Good value,"It was quite a bit less expensive and more compact (and simple) than most of the things we were looking at to go from a scuba tank to a paintball marker (gun) HPA tank. It seems to be getting a bit more touchy as we use it, but it still works great. It was great to be able to get it within 24 hours through Amazon when no other company we talked with could provide us with a similar part for several days to a couple weeks."
5,I thought it was great,"In the begging it was kind of slow. But towards the end it turned very good. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes adventure, planes, and/or history."
3,I don't agree with the size recommendation,"I have a 6 month old, 22lb dog (who will be in the upper 20s full grown) and I was originally unsure wether to get the Regular or Small Buddy System, but I went with the Regular based on The Buddy Systems recommendation. Unfortunately, the hardware that comes on the Regular is just too big, heavy and bulky for my dog, even in the future when she's full grown, so I'm exchanging it for a Small. I'm a little disappointed that the Small isn't available with the waist size the Regular has. Hopefully the small will be strong enough for my pup!"
2,the clip is HEAVY,This leash is too heavy. The clip that attaches to the dog collar is huge. Can be better manufactured. Yes the system does the job. But I believe there are better products on the market. Still looking for the 'right' one for my and my dog.
4,Good for Puppy Training,Great product for keeping your pup close to you so it doesn't make any mistakes in the house and keeps your hands free. The only problem I see is that the attachment to the leash slides around not keeping the dog on the left. I had to use a clip to keep it in place. Definitely recommend
5,nice stable leash,this leash works well on walks and runs to keep your hands free. since the connection is to your waist it make for a much more stable base if you dog pulls since you're connected at your center of mass. we use the leash to secure our dog while giving her a bath outside since both hands are free to wash but the dog can't run away from the hose
5,"Wow, perfect for our use",We have a service dog and our son is able to be attached to the dog while I am also attached to the dog. Having the leash attach to our waists is a huge convenience since the dog goes everywhere with us.
4,And there was a rabbit,"There we were enjoying the mid-afternoon hike thru the Tucson Mountains. Hands-free walk/hikes are great. Chance (my dog)was loving the smells and fresh air. I was getting exercise with my favorite buddy. And then there was a rabbit.... Out of the box my Labrador bolts and bam! The connector from not only the waist harness but also the connector from my dog's leash to the waist hook-in broke. That is correct both connectors broke. Chance ran off determined to catch this rabbit full tilt. Only the recall command made him stop and return to me. Thank gosh for my dog trainer and all of her wisdom to teach us (""Recall"") that.So if you have an 85 pound of muscular fur who evidently likes to chase rabbits I would recommend getting a hands free jogging leash that is stronger than this one.Kind regards"
5,Awesome for running!,"I have had this leash for a year and love it. It is so nice to have my hands free during a run. Despite group and private training, my dog still pulls so I use it with the Petmate AKC Padded Dog Halter. Actually after about a mile he will stop pulling as he gets into the run. With this collar I had to make a few modifications to make it work 1) the leash was a little long so I tie a not in it so my dog can't get in front of me (and trip me!) 2) the metal clasp of the collar knocks against my dog so I wrapped it with pipe insulation foam and held it on with a rubber band."
3,Recommended but needs modification for best use,"The idea of the system and the quality of the belts are great. I love the hands free ability and there's room on the belt for a treat pouch. The positioning of the connections are also very convenient and the idea of being able to latch the other end of the leash to the belt so it doesn't drag if the dog is off leash is very helpful. The hooks work well but the positions that the user sets the size of the waist belt and the length of the leash don't hold well; they need locked in some way so that they don't get bigger or longer during use. I am training my pup but she is not really a puller; however as we walk the waist belt sags on me and if she does put any pressure on the leash it lengthens causing me to have to hold the leash anyway! I only gave it three stars because with the price of The Buddy System, I think that two locking adjusters for sizing could be expected (one on the waist belt and one on the leash)."
5,My dog's dream come true.,"Before the Buddy System, I was reluctant to take my dog on walks because of the hassles of a regular leash. Now I just snap on the Buddy System and Kit and I head out the door to wherever. It is so much more enjoyable to take walks now."
1,Had to use duck tape after the first few uses!,This was what I was looking for but after trying it the first time my dog bite it once and then it started shredding from there! I had to use duck tape to try to stop it...but it now looks a bit funky and is hard to adjust!
5,The Real Deal,Dedicated to the memory of his father; dad must have been one funky SOB! If you can't find the groove on this CD you had better check your pulse!
1,Don't waste your money,"I just received the 3rd replacement and never asked for it. Asked for my money returned and have not had any luck. 1st unit had a bad transmitter/motion sensor. I was not able to even program it due to constant false signals. Sent that back and received second unit, it smoked and caught on fire the moment it was plugged into AC. It seems to be made cheaply and so much for quality control. Don't waste your money."
1,Defective out of the box,"I have the Reporter intercoms which work beautifully and do indeed have the advertised range. I ordered the RWV-400R to put 300 ft. away at my ranch's gate. The distance is successfully spanned by the Reporter intercoms and has no obstructions at all so I figured this unit would work well and alert me whenever someone approaches my gate.The unit arrived with some dirt and grass on it which made me suspicious that it had been returned. When I powered it up and tested it, it worked perfectly when the transmitter and receiver were just a few feet away, but at 40 feet and beyond, it was useless.I contacted Chamberlain Customer Service as they are the ones who now own the Reporter franchise. They did not have a clue. They do not know how their own product works. They did not offer to replace it with a working unit, but instead suggested I return it it Amazon for a refund."
3,They Clog pretty easy it seems,although thats just one of the downsides to the toddy cold brew system.It's all good though because I'm in love with my Toddy system in general.
2,"Nice setting, bland characters","I'm a big lover of tea, so I was really looking forward to getting into a mystery series based around a tea shop in a beautiful Southern city. Unfortunately, the tea shop and Charleston are about the best things this author has to offer. The mystery is light (I had the murderer pegged less than halfway through the book), and the characters are dull. The main character, Theodosia, is dull because she's impossibly perfect. She's beautiful, charming, successful, has impeccable taste in everything, and while one or two people don't outright worship her, they seem to always ""respect"" her or are ""intrigued"" by her. Even the stray mutt she took in for a pet is charming and spends his weekends as a therapy dog in a nursing home. It's too much. At least give her a rude habit or a bad hair day or something!So, two stars for the tea and the city, but there's not much else to recommend, unfortunately."
4,Keeping,Previously read from a library book and decided this one andthe ones she wrote after that were worth keeping in my library.I plan to reread them over and over because they are reallywhat I like.
4,Just my cup of murder,"Death by Darjeeling is a delight from begining to end, The protagonist and her co-workers are people you would like to know and the discriptions of Charleston tempt the reader into making a trip. It has an added benefit in that for a change I wasn't able to guess the murderer a third of the way through the book like I usually do. I feel as though Theo Browning is a friend, and I eagerly await her next outing. If you like a good cozy mystery this is the book for you."
3,Nice but . . .,"Death By Darjeeling was a good book but not a terribly rewarding mystery. I really liked the characters and the charming Southern locale. Dorothea is an interesting detective, in that she is a tea shop owner in a tightknit community. Childs writes very well about the relationships of her characters and her dialogue has the ring of real conversation. The only flaw (and this is a major one given that it is a mystery) is that the mystery was WAY too easy to solve. I won't give it away but I will say I was not impressed. Yet, b/c everything else worked so well, I will invest in another book in the series because the book made me cozy and comfy while sipping on my very own cup of tea."
1,Did not enjoy,"Not my kind of mystery, found myself bored with characters and plot line.Some may like it but I didn not."
4,Nice cozy mystery,"""Death by Darjeeling"" is a good mystery. The setting is nice - there's a lot of information about historic Charleston, which I found interesting. The characters were great - the tea shop employees and their neighbors, even Earl Grey the dog. The only ""jarring"" note was the ecologist/artist character who seemed out of place (unless the author has plans for him in a future book); he just didn't fit. But I'm looking forward to the next book (""Gunpowder Green"")."
1,A worse disappointment than decaf!,"This book just BLITHERS on and on. The author clearly knows far less about tea and the world of tea shops than she thinks she does - most of the brewing commentary would render you something more fit for the compost bin than the tea table - and the financial situations she creates for the tea related characters are overwhelmingly implausible. I found the book just about impossible to finish because there is nothing about the characters that makes them either plausible or interesting. The ""plot"" is also rather dismal.In summary: if you want a good book tea, read one of the fabulous FACTUAL histories of the brew. If you want a good mystery, try Allingham, Christie, Churchill or Dahiem."
3,"Cute, but odd","This series is entertaining in its way, but a little odd. I would have found it slightly less rough going if Theodosia Browning was in her sixties, rather than her thirties, as it's hard to believe she's a fairly young woman, judging from her rather proper and formal behavior and speech. Still, I enjoyed the coziness of the setting, being an avid tea lover. The series grew on me, once I got used to the old-fashioned way it seems to have been written. Was a bit like a time warp, as if it had been written in the 1950s. Worth checking out though, if you love tea and comfort scones and a light mystery."
2,Forced myself to read it,"I would only recommend this book if you want to read yourself to sleep. I tried several times to make it through this book, thinking that maybe it would take a few chapters to become interesting. The result? I got bored and read a different book. Very disappointed."
4,Fun read,This is the first in the series and I really enjoyed it. It is a light read with good characters and lots of interesting information about tea. If you are a tea lover this is a good book for you.
5,Cozy mysteries at their best!,"I have backtracked a bit, having read some of the newest books first. This book was a real hit with me. I just love all the tea talk and just the general conversation and mystery as well. She makes you really want to investigate right along with Theo because she leaves it open for several different characters.Always surprised at the endings though! Thanks for another great cozy mystery Ms Childs!"
3,"Enjoyable enough, but a bit pretentious","Relaxing read, quick read. Enjoyable, yet some of the dialogue and characters seemed somewhat pretentious or ""forced"" at times.I also don't like the way Theodosia is portrayed. She's supposed to be a woman in her mid-30's, yet her character seems years older than that. I have this image of a somewhat frumpy woman who's vastly older than her employees, yet there isn't much of an age difference. It's confusing at times.Would probably pick up the second in the series in a pinch, but wouldn't be my first choice.Did like the colorful portrayals of Charleston, however."
4,Childs brews up a charming cuppa!,"Theodosia Browning, proprietress of the Indigo Tea Shop of Charleston, goes a sleuthing when one of her staff is implicated in the death of sleazy real estate developer, Hughes Barron, at a society function catered by Theodosia. She feels impelled to clear her friend and save her own reputation and business. Delightful characters with wonderful names abound. The ambiance of Charleston is wonderfully captured.A charming summer read that can be enjoyed by the young and old alike without insulting anyone's sensibilities. I found myself wanting to grab a scone and cuppa. The tea lore and recipe were a intriguing addition. Looking forward to the next book in the series. Highly recommend to ladies of the RED HAT SOCIETY."
1,bad local info,"This is just the type of light, cozy mystery I normally love. Unfortunately, I live and work in the area, and the author, apparently, didn't even do a halfway research job, much less know anything about Charleston. The local details are really bad. A local mystery group panned it for the inaccuracies.Nor was the horticultural information accurate.Shame. This could have been lots of fun, but there is no way I would read anything else by this author after this sloppy job."
1,Perfectly Awful Book,"Only after buying four novels in the series and finding them truly awful did I read the Amazon reader reviews. Note to self: read the reviews first.This book (along with the others) is poorly written, with clumsy plotting and ridden with cliches. Many other reviewers have pointed out its manifold weaknesses.The author has borrowed stock characters from many popular cozies, notably the main character, a single woman who has left the rat race for a girly business. She lets the business dominate the story, telling me much more about tea than I ever wanted to know, while stuffing her thin, gorgeous characters with rich pastries.The best character is the dog."
3,"Good Start to a series, but weak detection","This novel had a good ambiance and I enjoyed all the details about tea blending, Charleston historic sites, and southern society. I was charmed by the main character and her supporting cast has promise--especially the cute lawyer, the dapper tea gourmet and blending guru, and southern lady to the core Aunt Libby. I did think the mystery itself took awhile to develop and the author's habit of flashing from one scene to the other and the inclusion of some scenes for no particular reason (attempts at red herrings?) were a little distracting. The plot was not as well crafted as other mysteries in this genre, and there were times when you really thought, ""Can we just get on with it?!?""--but all that being said it was a good start and was enough to get me interested in reading a sequel. I did think this was much better than the scrapbooking mystery series by the same author."
2,Death by Darjeeling,"I also purchased the entire series before checking any reviews...a mistake. I thought the book was quaint and the historical setting quite cozy, but the characters lacked personality and substance and the storyline was weak. I wanted to like this book (as I have three more to read) so I kept at it, hoping it would get better. Much to my disappointment, it was a struggle to finish."
3,"Long on tea, short on mystery","A very enjoyable beginning to a series that may have promise, but work needs to be done on the author's style and plot construction. After a satisfying number of red herrings, the true killer came out of left field -- a violation of my cardinal principle in evaluating mysteries: if I can't read the book a second time and find all the clues that pointed to the real killer, the author wasn't playing fair. On this ground, Childs is guilty of mystery writer's crime no. 1: inadequate clues pointing to the villain. The poison was never identified for the reader, so there was no ability to connect it to the perpetrator.I found the descriptions of Charleston and the intricacies of a Tea Shop fascinating, but I agree that Theodosia Browning, the lead character, seemed more like a woman in her 50s (or from the 50s!) than a current thirtysomething. The supporting characters were well drawn -- I enjoyed them all. Here's hoping for better plotting as the series proceeds."
4,A fine mystery with very vivid descriptions,"This novel is set in the historic district of Charleston. The main character owns the Indigo Tea Room. On the annual Lamplighters tour of historic houses, her tea room caters a garden tea in one of the historic houses. One of the waitresses finds a...[person] dead at one of the tables...Theodosia, the owner of Indigo Tea Shop is asked by her employees to find out who killed...[the person]The author has given us a cast of unusual and quirky characters. She has a real gift for description, which enhanced the story without going overboard. The mystery was excellent,...and I never knew that there was so much to learn about tea. I look forward to reading the next one."
2,POISON MY TEA,"This book was was trite, clique, and boring beyond decency. The only redeemable trait being the historical descriptions of Charleston, and the lovely idea of a tea shoppe. Midway, I was ready to admit guilt so the agony would end.Perhaps, I am not a fair critic of light fare..... it extracts from so many incredible works of art that await me. This was a required read for a book club so I gave it a go. If you enjoyed, ""Murder She Wrote"" this might entertain you. However, I think even Jessica Fletcher might have shyed from this mundane mystery murder."
4,Enjoyable,"I thought this book was very enjoyable and I was very interested in the characters. I bought this book hoping to be drawn into a new mystery series but I think the mystery ""itself"" lacked slightly. I think the likability of the characters saved the book. I would like to see more of a mystery theme in the next book of the series but as long as the story line includes interesting characters I'd be satisfied.Very inviting and fun!"
2,Hard to get through,"I had trouble getting through this book, and ended up unable to finish it. I love mysteries and I drink a variety of teas regularly, so I wanted to like this book, but I found the characters to be uninteresting and I was not able to relate to their feelings or lives much outside of their appreciation for tea, and even that I had trouble relating to."
2,Get an editor,"While the concept of this series is appealing, the author's constant grammatical errors and cliched phrases become tedious after a time. Her editor clearly needs to pay more attention. Once you begin noticing the chronic misuse of words and the misapplied adjectives and adverbs, the books become annoying to read."
4,Murder Stalks the Tour,"Laura Childs brings a delight heroine to DEATH BY DARJEELING. This entire series is a fun, fun, cozy summer reading. Join Theodosa Browing and her friends for a tea caper.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH"
4,Great for eczeme on my scalp,"I've been using Bioclenz and Scalp Response (now called Scalp Rinse) for 8 years and can't give them up because absolutely nothing else works for me. Trying other products always leaves me with a flaky scalp because I have eczeme. These products aren't for anyone wanting perfumed shampoo; they are simply great cleansers and conditioners for those who suffer scalp problems. I've tried other products to save money and have a bit of variety, but I always go back to Bioclenz and Scalp Response. My brother and I both have the same skin condition and love these products. (One note, buying Scalp Response is less expense through a local beauty store ($24 for 16 oz than here online (20 for 12oz.) The Bioclenz is a great savings though."
4,Bracket review,"Appears to be sturdy and securely mounts to the rough wood fence post. Elevates the Scarecrow high enough to ""see"" over the plants in the rock garden, and is holding steady after several trigger events. will be worth 5 stars if the mountain sun doesn't cause plastic to become brittle after the summer. I wish the company made an extension pole for their sprinkler head so I could move it around more."
1,Contech Scarecrow Mounting Bracket,"This bracket is an absolute waste. A $15 dollar waste too! I even tightened it with pliers, not just the hand tightening knob, and still wouldn't even adequately hold the Scarecrow in position. No chance of any real adjustment with this junk design either. Ended up using some electrical PVC brackets with great success, cost about $.40 each."
2,A single clamp fails to do the job,"This bracket is being marketed as an accessory to the Contech ScareCrow. I purchased it in order to mount my ScareCrow above ground. For this purpose, the manufacturer fails to deliver, because, while the single clamp of this bracket holds the ScareCrow horizontally, it fails to secure the ScareCrow vertically. The clamp, and hence the ScareCrow, swings in a vertical arc, even when it is not firing. No amount of tightening will help. It requires a bracket with two clamps, one above the other, to secure the ScareCrow vertically."
2,Weak,This product is very flimsy and does not properly support the weight of the Scarecrow motion activated sprinkler. It does not tighten enough to have a grip. I had to add some wire to hold the sprinkler to the post. I wouldn't recommend this product.
4,Contech Scarecrow Bracket,This bracket would work but we didn't need it. Item bought for did not explain what we would need the bracket for.
4,SCARECROW DOES THE JOB,"Contech CRO101 Scarecrow Motion Activated SprinklerFinally got the scarecrow sprinkler after 8years of watching the birds, flying south for the winter, and on their return, stopping to feast on my fish (kois 2-3#s and large gold fish), also the neighborly racoons. This year, so far, all my fish are here - scared but OK!"
3,not too impressed,"Obscure by Clouds, the sound track to La Vallee, is much better than the movie itself. In fact I only remember floyd playing here and there, the soundtrack did not play a big role in the movie. The scenery in La Vallee was amazing but thats about it. The plot line was interesting but it was pretty slow going and many scenes seem to drag on. It ends abruptly before a climax even occurs. Unlike a different review that was written, I had no trouble turning the subtitles on. The fact that 90% of the movie is in French was not the turn off for me (although it might bother some) I don't think it's a ""must see"" for hardcore floyd fans like myself. I would recommend watching ""more"" the other of the floyd/schroeder colaboratives. This one was somewhat boring."
3,The valley,"Singular story about a woman looking for feathers and an expedition of people looking for paradise in a valley which is not drawn on the map. So, they suppose paradise must be there, obscured by clouds. A hippy philosophy but with a touch of scepticism. A picture of the late 70's with a beautiful photography by Nestor Almendros."
3,Pink Floyd snorefest....,"...coming after the brilliant MEDDLE, this album posed a problem for Floyd... they were tired of being a Euro ""Cult"" band in the US, and needed to start racking up sales-after all 'the '60's' were over with. So it came to pass that OBSCURED BY CLOUDS would be the last 'honest' Floyd LP, though because of the constraints placed on them for an OST, I find it to be a rather lackluster album...but it started their slide from artistic purity to commercial $uccess-yes im talking about every post-pubescent boys wet dream, finally radio friendly to corporate owned FM stations-and still on the charts after 30 years, the mediocre, but trillion-selling DARK SIDE OF THE MOON...(just because it sells tonnes dont mean its any good) Oh... the film was OK..."
3,Pink Floyd II,"This movie was purchased as part of a collection of Pink Floyd works. This one being slightly more tasteful than Z-point. however most of it's in French, so Sub-titles, for me was important. Still the over all theme left me only thinking of the sound tract."
3,La Valle - no english subtitles,"The move is a classic, specially by lovers of Pink Floyd music. But, there is no subtittle in english, so the move is spoken in french, I could understood few dialogs."
2,"Great band, good performance, lousy quality",Classic Miles from the early 70s but both the sound quality and picture quality are very poor. Looks as if someone put a videocam in front of a TV screen and recorded a live TV broadcast. Consists four tracks of 56 minutes:1. Untitled Original2. Caylpso Frelimo3. For Dave [Mr. Foster]4. Tune InThis DVD is only for collectors and historians.
3,"Great Subject Matter, Mediocre Execution","While I commend the author for undertaking what must have been a difficult project given the time elapsed and the ""off the record"" nature of the subject matter, the book could have been better organized and more carefully paced to present a coherent sense of Norma Wallace and her life and times. Instead it often feels jumbled, disjointed, and uneven, with certain sections of the narrative rather jarringly misplaced. Overall, however, the subject matter is fascinating enough to hold one's attention and the glimpses through the peephole into a simultaneously glamorous and seedy aspect of New Orleans history are intriguing."
2,Just 'Cause It Involves Sex and New Orleans Doesn't Mean It's A Winner,"I confess that I have been reading a number of books on ""landladies"" (according to this book, and notwithstanding its title, only squares use the term ""madam"") and this one had all the ingredients: politics, the Big Easy, and a singular central character. Unfortunately, Wiltz's prose is at best workmanlike. Other than Norma Wallace, the title character, none of the prostitutes and none of the johns (or Wallace's husbands) are rendered in sufficiently distinct terms to tell them apart. Also, Wiltz references a phone book of political figures and corrupt cops, but doesn't provide any analysis of Wallace's connection to them, nor why Wallace flourished while others went to jail. Admittedly, there are a number of wonderful and picaresque snippets in Last Madam to put a grin on your face, but perhaps the fact that Wiltz never got to interview Wallace makes the treatment at best a mere scratching of the surface."
4,Great account!,"This story tells of the life of a New Orleans madam and how her youth shaped her whole life, from leaving a less-than-ideal family to set out on her own to build her own fortune and fame. Always adhering to strict rules to provide the highest class of service to her clients, Norma is on a constant search for true love, often finding that she couldn't give up her work to stay home and be a traditional wife and mother. In the end, Norma gets the guy, until her obsession with beauty and youth becomes more than even she can handle and her world slowly starts to fall apart.The only criticism is that this book is less like a story and more a historical account of her life. Nonetheless, a very interesting read!"
1,Very poorly written,"I was very suprised to see how many good reviews this book received. It does tell a very interesting story, but the author destroys the book by being, quite simply, once of the worst writers in the history of mankind. The first few chapters are straight fact, without any effort to telling a story. Finally the pace slows down, but so much so that you want to scream for this person to move on with the story. I had to force myself to finish this book. You can take note of how bad this book is, by the fact that even though the book was just published, there are several used copies available already."
2,Poorly written,"I read the reviews for this before ordering, but I still wanted to give it a chance. It just didn't hold my interest at all. Some of the content was interesting, but the way it was presented, I just had to force myself to try to read it."
2,"Slow, boring, read","You defintely get the smell, taste, and view of New Orleans from this book. Thats why I didnt give it one star. Excellent descriptions and awesome facts. BORING!!!!!!! It was awkward read. It was a little too factual. I felt like I was reading a scholarly essay at some points. When the story did get moving, it was very slow. I rushed through it, even skipping many parts due to the slow pace of the plot. Great facts...I did alot of highlighting...but not a good cuddling, read."
1,"Great story, poorly written","This is like someone took an amazing story and put it into a blender. The flashbacks and constant switching of timeframes is unnecessary and takes away from the story. I can see why this element is sometimes used, but it is not only not helpful here, it is distracting and overused. The other stories I've heard told about Norma are fascinating. This one could have been too, but the writing techniques used to deliver the story got in the way."
4,Good book and an Excellent Book if you are From New Orleans,"New Orleans is one of the most visited cities in the USA. Even the casual visitor has been told the stories of prostitution and corruption in the majestic French Quarter. The story of Norma Wallace based in part on her audio taped autobiogaphy gives the present day reader the best look at what this life was really like. The writer is convincing, by naming names and places, that the world's oldest profession was almost respectible, even in the last half of the 20th century. The research done to write this book is amazing. The opinion you form of Norma, by the end of the book,is surprising. A good book and a must if you are familiar with New Orleans"
4,Good book,I really liked this book. This woman's story is astounding and unfortunately very sad. I just wish there had been more pictures of her. The author talks a lot about how beautiful she was but I just didn't get a good feeling for that in the photos presented. Other than that it was a quick and interesting read.
2,"Amazon ""Bait & Switch""","WHAT I ORDERED:Mayfair Premium Plastic Oblong Toilet Seat, WhiteWHAT I RECEIVED:Bemis PLastic Oblong Toilet Seat, WHiteThe Bemis product is similar, but not what I ordered. I did not want the hassle of fighting the returns, extra shipping expenses to get what I ordered, so I'm living with it. The Idea of ""Bait & Switch"" makes me sick."
5,The Foos acoustic,"The foo fightes are a great rock band. They are great at pumpin out fast and heavy tunes as well as some soft ones. On this Cd you will find 3 acoustic songs. If you like the foo fighters soft songs this cd is for you. The 3 acoustic songs are ""Floaty"", ""Ain't it the Life"", and ""Next Year"". As well as these great acoustic tracks the Foo single Breatkout is on the cd. Grohl has a great voice for soft songs so I strongly recommend this cd."
3,Was expecting more,"I bought this dvd because of the yin-yang aspects. I had never heard of Simon Low and while he has a wonderful manner and voice, I was a little disappointed in the dvd. I would have liked two 30 minute yangs to do either together or to pick between. The yin yoga had many props, bolsters, blankets, blocks, etc. which he would explain how to get into the pose, but then he would offer an alternative afterwards that didn't require any prop. I would have preferred to hear about the prop-free pose first and then the other. It was definitely restorative yoga. All in all, I will use this dvd on occasion but find I prefer doing Sara Ivanhoe and/or Rodney Yee yoga dvds more."
5,Celticly appealing,I am new to Celtic Music. I am just trying to get a hold of as many as possible. I happened upon an Eileen Ivers concert and i am a fan for life. I enjoyed this compilation.
2,Not what I expected,"This album disappointed me, and it's partially my fault for not listening to ALL the sound samples. I already have the Aine Minogue and Galway & Coulter CDs in which two of each albums' songs are included on this CD. I was looking for something new, not a sampling of other albums. I hate the Boston Pops version of Riverdance - electric guitars and the monotonous beat of pop-rock drums (something the sound bite sample did not reveal). Plus the selection of music ranges from lively to mellow, vocals to instrumental. I wanted an album of smooth meditative music.So if you want a generic selection of Celtic-sounding tunes, you may like this CD. But if you are looking for a cohesive group of melodies, avoid this one! I rated it two stars for the mismatched composition and my disappointment, but the artists deserve more than one star (buy their CDs, not this one)."
5,Powerful ... will get your head noddin',"Reminiscent of Dieselboy's Soldier's Story at times, this disk has a punchy and powerful list of tracks. Release domestically on Dieselboy's ""Human Imprint"" label - you really can't go wrong with Bad Company."
5,"great music, but this isn't an actual CD","the music is great, 5 stars, but this isn't an actaul CD. the CD logo doesn't appear on the discs or packaging. there is a note in the jacket that says ""All tracks copyright control,"" so if you plan on listening to this on your computer or converting to mp3 for a portable device, it might not work. it does work great in my cd player though."
2,Big Let Down,"If you're a junglist, you cannot deny the talent of BC. But let's be honest. This mix was uninspired and dull. There was almost no creativity put into this. It was just a big promo with nothing but Bad Co. tracks(which wouldn't be bad if the mixs were on point). The best part about this cd was just the individual tracks on the first cd. If you are a new comer to the scene, I recommend you buy this just because it shows alot of styles of drum'n'bass and the tracks are top shelf. But if you're a real junglist that appreciates solid mixes with creativity involved, STAY AWAY."
5,"Disc 01 Better, Disc 02, Best","How can you go wrong? Two discs. One disc featuring all of the tracks (unmixed and in full) from the Shot Down On Safari LP released on BC Recordings. Another disc featuring a superb mix of the best drum n' bass ever produced. Exclusive tracks only spun by the very best drum n' bass djs. Only one complaint: whoever mixed the second disc didn't let the tracks playout long enough. Most of the tracks are played for only about 1:30 or 2:00. You get an idea of what they are, but it's still too fast. But, don't let that stop you! This is a great cd for any DJ or casual raver, regardless of your style!"
5,Works as designed,"At times, no matter how many tools one has in their 'box'...there is always tthat 'special' tool that is required. This is one of those. Recently while visiting a local Toyota dealership and working with some of their techs, I encountered this tool. Very soon afterwards while working on a late model Toyota Prius AC, a need for this tool was encountered. A quick order and thanks to Amazon's quick service we were able to complete our repair. Since then the tool has paid for itself many times over by reducing the time necessary to complete various repairs."
1,I'll never buy Silverline again.,An insult to all the good 5.1 recordings out there ( and I have a LOT ) this is the ONLY one I've sold to the local used record store ! Just a practically mono recording fed through all six channels with a blanket of echo over the top !!!Thank God I didn't spend that much in the first place !Silverline ? Not after THIS.I ENDED UP SELLING IT...the ONLY 5.1 audio disc I've ever sold !!!
2,What happened to her Salsera roots?,"I was very disappointed in this latest release. Her first CD was great with some good original salsa and great vocals, the second release OK and with this 3rd one it's to commercial/pop. This attempted transition to pop is a mistake in my opinion. I hope she returns to her original style soon."
5,Be ready for this book to change your life,"This book really opened my eyes to how to have a genuine relationship with God. Also the book help me to decided to stop taking my anti-depressants. I learned that through him I have the strength to get through life moments of anxiety and i do not need medication to help me, because God is bigger than medication."
2,if your expect more happy hardcore dont get this,I was very disapointed after purchasing this. Its not the same old happy hardcore scooter. Very weak compared to his old stuff.its a no buy unless you must have it
4,High energy and wonderful MC!,"I adore Scooter, it's incredibly upbeat and energizing. The MC talks through a lot of the songs, which I really love. There are some slow songs that threw me off a bit, but they will grown on you. If you like High energy trance then this is perfect for you!"
5,Great Stuff!!,Love it. I have other Scooter Albums but this one is my Favorite! Love the high energy..gets you moving to the Beat!!
5,Another amazing one from Greg.,"I was just thinking how few attempts have been made to mix ""guitar god"" playing with humor. Joe Walsh & Paul Gilbert are the only ones who come to mind.Greg Koch seems to have both. He's good enough to never be heard on the radio and he just happens to be a funny guy, too. BTW, his instructional videos are excellent and yes, very funny. I agree, The Grip is a bit more focused but there's still a lot of meat on Radio Free Gristle."
4,This guy belongs on the G3 tour!,Really this guy is a true example of perfect guitar playing! This will not disappoint guitar lovers! I still might like Grip a bit better but still awesome! Awesome tone and style and chops!
2,Some spooky images,"But the story is dumb. The nuns are erie, especially the one in white carrying a baby wrapped in a bloody rag, but the story isn't really that interesting. By the time he 45 minute mark came I was tired of looking at the frightened look on the leading lady's face with really nothing much going on.Alot more could have been going on, but nothing ever really happens.BEST PART: A woman gets killed by he pet cats....but it's obvious she's getting ttacked by hand puppets!"
2,"made no sense, yet had a neat topless killer","dunno, twas a bit odd, and funny. not really worth watching, except for like a topless scene or two involving a cross bow."
2,Waste of time,"I love Fulci's zombie flicks, but this is something very different. Evil nuns coming back to take revenge sounds like a cool idea but trust me, the execution of the story is really bad. The last 20 minutes are so confusing and stupid I just wish I hadn't even bothered with it. House By The Cemetery, Gates Of Hell and the Beyond blow this away. There is some decent gore here but it doesn't save the film. Fulci had just lost his touch at this point, so I'd say see this only if you are a completist."
2,lucio fulci probably at his worst...,"there ya have it, probably at his worst with this piece of work. don't waste your time with this video like i have."
3,Something Different From The Godfather Of GORE,"Well at least he tried something new. While ""Demonia"" pales in comparison to some of his early works such as ""Zombie"" (1980) and ""The Beyond"" (1981) this one definitely one of Fulci's better films later in his career. It certainly isn't as bad as ""Sweet House of Horrors"" (1989) (which I contend is by far his worst film.)The story is based around the 16th century crucifixion of a couple of nuns. Professor Pual Evans and his prize pupil Liza Harris struggle to uncover the horrifying mystery. The story moves a bit slowly, the ending is quite confusing and the gore is sprinkled throughout the film but not incredibly over the top as it was in the previously mentioned ""Zombie"" and ""The Beyond"". I recommend this film for Fulci fans only. However, don't expect a masterpiece!"
1,a poor film by alate master!,So awful I sold my copy to buy robocop a real exploitation film of merit and enjoyment!
1,Horrible!! entire chapter missing from the book. Do not buy.,This was a horrible purchase. My wife almost got a bad grade on an assignment because she found out at the last minute this bok had an entire chapter missing. Buyer beware!
1,Not that good,I am currently reading Ida B. as a read aloud to my 6th grade students. The book is taking entirely too long to read and has already lost my attention.The writing is rather monotonous and boring. I have really grown to dislike this main character. Yes. the book does have a lot of figurative language and challenging vocabulary for students to chew on for a while but the character is rather flat and strange. She is spoiled beyond belief. The author gives the main character an arrogance that is truly irritating.I'm plowing through this one and hope to never read it again.
2,Something is missing here...,"My biggest complaint about this book is that Ida never acknowledges her spoiled, self-absorbed behavior toward her parents. I was expecting a scene at the end of the book where she grows up a little and shows compassion and concern for her mother's health. I was waiting for her to apologize to her parents for her behavior, realizing that her mother didn't get cancer on purpose and her father had no choice but to sell land to pay for medical bills. Instead, she apologizes to the trees and to the river and her classmate, and that's it. To make it worse, she ""senses"" that her father apologizes to her. It would have been so much better if Ida B. had learned a lesson about life's difficult choices."
2,Not the best,"This book is pretty bad.I read it and it did a bad job of explaining that Ida was actually angry that her mom got cancer and she had to go to school. Another reason that I rate this book two stars is that Ida's parents let her do a few days of school.Then since she did not like it, they just pulled her out and home schooled her. That can make a lot of children think that when they just don't like school, they can be pulled out and home schooled.Although this book has a lot of things that I don't like, I think the author had a pretty good idea of doing the home schooling business and then Ida having to go to school. It could have been a really great book for me, if the author had only made it a bit less confusing."
4,Debut Novel,"For a debut novel, I thought this was really very good. Ida B. has a strong, compelling voice and I loved her relationship with the trees and streams and nature all around her.I think girls will especially love this book because Ida B. isn't a perfect little kid, but she is a thoughtful kid and a kid who cares deeply about things.Ida B. is a good read and I will certainly pick up the next novel that Katherine Hannigan publishes."
4,Are You a Nature Lover?,"_Ida B._ by Katherine Hannigan, is about a young girl, that adores nature. Her life is turned upside-down when her mother gets cancer. Ida B. is forced to go to public school, after being home-schooled all her life (except the first few days of kindergarden). Ida B. learns to deal with school, but that's the least of her problems. Ida B.'s parent need to sell the land that Ida B. is oh-so close with, and that is truly rage in Ida B.'s perspective. Ida B. turns cold after that and she is forced to deal with it. Reading this book, put me in a parrelle universe, as though I was inside the book. I felt that I could realate to Ida B. and her relationship with nature. I though that Katherine Hannigan went overboard with Ida B.'s feelings. _Ida B._ is worth reading !:)"
3,Ida B's Review,"The book Ida B is an okay book. It wasn't as exciting as I thought it would be though. I felt that it just kept going on and weren't any really exciting parts that make you want to keep reading. It was descriptive when it said ""Daddy paused, but it was just to get some more of those cleansing breaths."" Ida B would not be my first choice."
2,"Characters not believable, very negative","The title is misleadingly upbeat. This very negative book has characters that our whole family could neither believe or support. Ida B, the main character, does virtually nothing to maximize fun or save the world. As a homeschooled girl, she is sent to 4th grade in public school and apparently knows no other children. She starts out withdrawn, then becomes antagonistic, and finds a weak ""redemption"" very late in the book. The setting is Wisconsin, but all the characters use language more like Tennessee. She continually refers to ""my heart"" - about every third sentence.I don't know what kind of childhood the author had, but I hope there are no real children like Ida B. If this is at all realistic, it is a good argument against home schooling."
3,Ida B.,"This character in this book, Ida B., is like Junie B. Jones 4 years later. Only in this case, it's as if she's met up with the apple trees from the Wizard of Oz or Grandmother Willow from Pocahontas. A little too cutzy for me."
5,And I thought this book would be dumb!,"My Dad bought me this book about a year ago. I had thought it would be sooo stupid... Surprise! It was so good! It starts out with a home schooled girl, Ida B, who has a perfect life. She talks to the trees and the stream and is talented and kind. Then, as if she were a ""lizard that found a warm black rock to lay one then realized it was the middle of the road"", everything changes. Her mother gets cancer, and Ida B's family has to sell part of the apple orchard they live at, and she has to go to real school. Ida B becomes mean and cold-hearted, especially when she finds out who moved into the land where the trees were cut down! This book is descriptive, funny, and overall awesome. Anyone could read it."
5,Just amazing,"This book is just plain amazing. Katherin Hannagin is very good at expressing the characters feelings. Shes also very descriptive. She knows how to make us feel what the characters feel and thats pretty hard to do, and shes very good at making things funny at the right time. I loved this book so much. That is why I feel that ""Ida B"" should have 5 stars."
4,Great realistic fiction,"A sweet book that reminds adults that when cancer happens, it does happen to everyone in the household, not just to the one diagnosed.Ida B's life is going great, according to her, and then her mother's cancer changes everything. This is a great story about a 4th grader who is just trying to survive her mother's tragic diagnosis, not expecting anything to change; however, everything in Ida B's life changes because it has to, and she isn't happy about it.The book focuses on emotion that Ida B is feeling about all the sudden changes in her life, and I feel it is a realistic portrayal of a 9-year-old."
4,If trees could talk...,The main character almost makes you believe you can communicate with trees. Near the ending is a good section on having the courage to apologize when you have harmed other people. This is the author's first book.
5,A great and meaningful book,"This book will make you laugh and cry, most importantly think. In ""Ida B."" by Katherine Hannigan, enables readers to enjoy a great story. It demonstraits real life situations and real life morals and lessons.I may only be 12 years old but I know a great book when I see one."
2,Ida B not voting for this in the YRCA,"Well, when I first opened Ida B, I really liked her but then about half way through the book, her behavior became heavy. I was beginning to feel exhausted!! It was a cute story but not my pick for the YRCA (Young Reader Choice Awards)"
5,Excellent!,"The recipes in this book have never failed to please. Unlike a lot of low fat cookbooks, the food in this cookbook is tasty and usually easy to prepare. Highly recommended."
1,DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS ONE!,"If the option was available, I would have rated this a ""0"".I have read many, many books on the subject of creating one's life, manifesting, changing one's reality, etc.---and this book just isn't worth the time OR the money. I am promptly returning my copy.A lot seemed to be about the author herself, and what a wonderful psychic she claims to be. Throughout, there are some stories of how some of her clients have changed their lives to some extent.But, as far as delivering information on how to actually accomplish this for yourself---the book contains practically no information. There are so very many better books available on this subject. Just do a search for ""manifesting"" or ""manifest"" or ""manifestation"" and you'll find them. Try such authors as Jerry & Esther Hicks, Ernest Holmes, James Randolph Price and Wayne Dyer, to name just a few.I rarely write a bad review of a book, but I just had to express my dismay over this one."
5,excellent product,"Its impossible to buy these side shields from any eye glasses mega store, just walk in and ask for side shields and the people behind the counter will frown and look at you like you're crazy.These fit perfect and comfortable too!"
5,Eye Protection,These side shields fit right over my regular prescription glases and work wonderfully. I feel very protected from the elements when wearing these during my work and recreation.
1,They are NOT glasses,"Contrary to the picture. These are NOT a pair of glasses, they a simply a pair of side shields that ONLY fit b52 glasses"
2,Fit large glasses but are uncomfortable,"These shields do fit larger frames, but they attach with flimsy acrylic like bands, nothing permanent and not easily. They make ear pieces too tight so if you have to wear them all day, be prepared for a head ache."
2,"big tag, little value",My 7 year old spent her birthday money on one of these and we were very disappointed. The quality of the screen and pictures is terrible and there are only about 4 or 5 different pages to color and it never does what you want it to. Luckily WM had them mistagged and we picked ours up on clearance for only $11 but even at that price I still feel jipped. Don't waste your money.
2,"Much information, but no attribution","Decent information on the different methods of preserving foods throughout history. The main problem I have, however, is the lack of footnotes -- Shephard cites many interesting anecdotes. Unfortunately, many of these cry out ""urban myth"" to me. An example:""Louis XIII of France loved [dried mushrooms'] woodland scent so much that he lay on his deathbed in 1643 threading mushrooms onto strings for drying.""A good story, yes. Actual historical fact? It seems unlikely, and without documentation I can't judge the source material."
3,"Pickled, Potted, Canned","The author knows food, but has weaknesses in other areas. For example, still holds long-discredited belief that the pyramids were built by slaves."
2,where is the character developement,this book was extremely fast paced. in the first 200 pages i couldn't care less about the character. he just went from normal joe to guerrilla leader in like 20 pages. met people with little background information and no character development. in the second 200 pages the make little to no references to elephant which was pretty much the objective of the previous 200 pages. all and all i found it mediocre.
5,Empire of the East,"Excellent epic by Saberhagan. Long tale of a post-apocalyptic Earth and how magic and magical beings good and evil, have been loosed upon the Earth. Good read."
2,CAREFUL BAD STITCHING.,"I BOUGHT A COUPLE OF THESE DIRECTLY FROM THE VENDOR AND THEY WERE OKAY, THESE HOWEVER WERE SLOPPILY SEWN, I HAD TO REPAIR ONE OF THEM, I USE THE AT WORK TO KEEP GREASE AND DIRT OUT OF MY HAIR-I'M A MECHANIC. I DON'T KNOW BUYING SOME THINGS OVER THE INTERNET IS VERY LIKE GAMBLING. THE ITEMS ARE SO MINISCULE, I'M NOT BOTHERING TO ASK FOR EXCHANE OR REFUND. I TOOK MY CHANCES."
4,a little too big,"This is a high-quality, well-constructed and soft head wrap. I would consider my head medium sized and I am 5'10"" and I can tie and wear this wrap, but it requires some overlap of the wrap on the sides, which does not really look right to me [subjective]. I have other headwraps that do not require any overlap because they are smaller.. Otherwise, no problems, it's a quality item."
3,"Close,but no cigar","I wasn't trying to make a fashion statement when I sent for this wrap, I sweat a lot when working outside, cutting the grass in my yard is a couple of hours work. it is a good quality heavyweight material and fully functional for the task I intended. Why only 3stars then you ask? I had the dubious honor of having the largest head in my regiment, my officers caps had to be special ordered. Getting to the point this wrap is big even for someone as cranially blessed as I!"
4,nice wrap - not for under a helmet though,A really nice wrap with plenty or size for getting a decent coverage of you head especially with a big melon like mine! The only thing to be weary of is this wrap has a padded band around the forehead which is great fro sweat but at least for me makes it not practical to use under my helmet?
5,NICE HEAVY DUTY WRAP,"Very nice, heavy duty head wrap. Sweat band in the front part. One size fits all. I purchased one of these several years ago, and its still in great shape. You should get several years use out of one."
3,ok,this item was overall ok..but not quite what I expected...the lining kept turning out..would prefer not to have lining for more comfort.
1,Wrong stopper,"Because I bought the Ronco brew system, I thought extra stoppers would be a good idea. Your information said that those who bought the Ronco also bought these. THEY DO NOT FIT. They are for the Toddy!"
4,Highly praised by Louisiana historian,"My mother's family came from Sicily in the late 1800's and immigrated to LA to become a part of the historic strawberry farming boom which in some ways redefined Louisiana. I wrote to a Louisiana historian requesting info and photos from the early 1900's and she praised this book very highly.She said it has ""zillions of photos and information"" regarding the Sicilian strawberry farmers.I look forward to receiving this and adding to my family tree info."
3,"A decent, 'invisible' debut","Powderfinger's Debut. They were trying to rock out of the park, but the album can be a mess. Still, that's not such a bad thing, why can't rock be complex as well?So they lambast their way through a thirteen track set of predominantly heavy grunge and a few acoustic ditties. Some of the songs fail, such as the laborious first single, 'Tail', but others are a roaring success, like the hypnotic aocustic tune 'Save your skin', while other's just plain rock (Solution).The surprise is how many good songs there are, heavy music wasn't supposed to be this melodic (blanket) , or carry this much emotional conviction, as 'Father's Pyramid' and 'walking stick' do.But when other tracks are poorly written, by a band not yet ripe, with a producer they don't really mesh with, this album could only ever see a more average rating, try ***"
4,Young Adult Literature At Its Finest,"I do not understand why everyone is out there bashing this book. I read it last week, and I absolutely enjoyed it. This book makes people think, especially teenagers, and it is a wonderful chance to think about what people are doing to the world. Just because the main character, Josh/Larry, believes in trying to make a difference, parents and kids alike are pigeon-holing this book as unrealistic and whiny. If more people read this book, maybe caring about the environment and consumerism and the rest of the issues Josh/Larry addresses would be more common and not thought of as unrealistic."
3,Review,"In this book, Josh disguises himself as his alter ego ""Larry"" by hosting a website which sparks a whole new revolution and the word ""anti-consumerism"" becomes a household name. However with all his fans come one person whom their curiosity takes the best them, and winds up ruining ""Larry"".Overall, The Gospel According To Larry wan a decent book which illustrates daily high school drama with a mix of lying and deceiving. It's a good book for a one-time read but i wouldn't reccommend reading it more than once."
1,Absolute trash.,"Terrible premise, riddled with bias and propaganda, poorly written..who likes this garbage?It might have been digestible had the author not taken the book as an opportunity to set up her soapbox and bombard the reader with an endless array of blatant personal opinion and warped views. If you're the kind of pompous pseudo-intellectual teenager who goes to coffee shops with your chic friends to discuss politics you know nothing about and senseless,convoluted philosophies, you'll love this book. If you're intelligent: Stay away."
4,TGATL,"This book was a quick read for me. I devoured it all in one day. I couldn't stop reading it; it drew me in from the beginning and didn't let go until the very last page. Josh was an extremely interesting character, and everything about him seemed so... impossible, in a way, like no one in the real world would act the way he did or do the things he did. But, in another way, I felt a real connection to him, like he was an actual person, a friend. I still wonder wether this is a fiction or nonfiction book. There's a sequel, though, which I have not read, so I'm guessing the former. That's kind of sad, I liked the thought that Josh/Larry could be anyone I met on the street..."
5,This is my favorite book.,"I found the book in my high school library freshman year. The combination of the cover art, preview blurb, and title sold me. Since then (8 years ago, yeesh), I've reread this book at least twice a year, and recommended it to everyone I know. The struggles in the book are universal, and every time I read it, I want to leave grid for a while and see what happens. I connect with Josh like I've never connected with any other character; there aren't a lot of books about anti-capitalist 17-year-olds. I own the two sequels, but I haven't read them yet, because I'm scared they will ruin the magic."
5,Simply Amazing,"I sat down and read the entire book straight through, cover to cover. And I cried three times. Then I cried one more time when I found out it wasn't true. This was a wonderful book and I'd recommend it to any mildly disenfranchised teenager... or anyone else, for that matter. I don't care if it's true or not, it changed me. I plan on reading it again tomorrow... and that is a rare occurance, indeed, when I can read an entire book then read it again right away."
2,Boring,"Anyone who has played Hitman:Silent Assassin will notice this is the same game. I think they had this one in the bag for 2 years and just waited to release it. Some of the missions are the same as Hitman: Codename 47. The whole game is flashbacks and then finally the last mission continues the plot with little advancement...very dissapointing.If you can't get enough stealth action or running around killing (dont play this game on normal mode, waste of time) you'll probably dig it. If you want a storyline and some sort of point to it, you're not going to get it. This game is re-hashed european crap. If you want to try Hitman, buy Silent Assassin for $20."
3,One of the most original games,"Forget the horrible movie, this game series is trendous. More N64 Bond meets Indiana Jones for X-Box than your run of the mill military combat games. Game is all element and not so much flash and bang. Play's like a movie. I just picked this game up to give my X-Box on final run before I let it go, its timeless like its former. Great Game"
5,Bloody fun!,Graphicly violent loaded with blood sex and violence . Not a kids game at all . Great addition to hitman. Story is assanine . But the game is great .
2,Massacre,"This game is an absolute riot. You can easily slaughter basically anyone, and the vast arsenal at your disposal is quite impressive. The campaign mode is not very challenging, but there is a lot of replay value for certain levels. The graphics are pretty impressive for their time, but nothing really to write home about. If you get this game for the right price, you'll still enjoy it, even though it is outdated."
1,Garbage,"this game is horrible. the best part of the game was the training mode, where you could run around and shoot moving targets like duck hunt. even then, the controls were worse than GTA. it's difficult to shoot accurately. the programmers know this, thats why as long as the target turns red, its a hit, even if it looks like a no chance shot. You can drag bodies and switch clothes, but it all seems rather pointless. you can try and sneak around, but it seems like it doesnt matter. you can just kill them however you want anyway. reloading is riduclously slow too, and before you die, time slows down and so it seems like it takes f o r e v e r. There are a lot of other games out there. I don't recommend wasting cash on this one. if you're looking for a shooter like halo, try kill switch. if you're looking for a sneak around game like metal gear, try tenchu. if you're just looking for more violence, take it up a notch and try manhunt. save your money and pass on hitman."
4,Performs as expected,The material and the snaps are of good quality and in the month I've had them have had great performance. The only pair of pants I could find with snaps all the way up both legs. This was the only product that fit over my foot after my surgery.
2,Too long,These pants were described as having a 29 inch inseam but actually have a 32 inch inseam for the 2X size. Too long for my short legs!
2,How big is small?,"I am a 5'10"", 163lb guy. I order the medium adidas break away warmup pants, they were about a foot to long!I play tennis, these must be made for basketball players. If you are under 5'7"" you will have to have the small pants tailored."
5,As advertised,"product arrived quickly and as advertised. my husband loves these pants. We have not had them a long time but have not had any issues in the few weeks we have had them,"
5,Snap Pants,My husband has orthopedic pins in his leg therefore he need somthing warm to wear that would fit over the pins. The snap pants are the greatest. Thank you The Howards
3,Adidas snap pants,"They are what I needed for wearing with a cast on my leg. I bought two pair, one of them had a snap come out the first time I wore them. Locally I was told the stores don't carry them because of this. Maybe Velcro would be better?"
2,Too long,Had to return this product because the inseam was too long. Usually the inseam is 29.5 inch for medium size but this one was 32 inches long. The material and quality was great though. I will pay a few dollars more and order one of these from adidas.com.
4,Pretty good,"They appear more baggy on me than they are on the model in the picture. They almost look flared at the bottom. They also create a lot of static which can get uncomfortable on bear legs (particularly if you have hairy legs). They fit true to the size guide around the waist. However, I am 5ft11 and ordered a medium with a 32"" waist. The legs seem very long which adds to them being incredibly baggy.All in all I like them, but I wish they were a tiny bit less baggy."
2,Pants,"I have only had the pants for a month, Maybe less and the top snap is broke. For 50.00 I would expect a lot more."
1,"Nice, but weren't tearaway","Am I the only one who received regular Adidas warm up pants? The description clearly states tearaway pants, which these were not. Cut slightly small as well"
5,Definitly Helpful,"While most other college roommate books that have 'adult' authors are out of touch, Fee's book hits home and used real life examples to help solve common roommate issues. Her answers and suggestions are top of the line and not the cheesy suggestions some authors attempt to pass off to a 20 something generation! This is definitly a book all young adults heading into a roommate situation should be given!"
1,not worth the money,Very disappointed in the conditionof this book. Looked like it have been sitting on an shelf for a century. The pages were yellowed and there were many stickers from libraries all over the book. Only read a little and was disappointed.
5,Here's the book I wish I had in college....,"College prepared me for many things, but I certainly wasn't prepared for college. MY ROOMMATE IS DRIVING ME CRAZY! is a book I wish I had around when I went to college. With humor and wisdom, Susan Fee explains everything incoming first-year college students (as well as upperclass students) need to know about living with roommates. From communication issues to sexuality, from financial concerns to campus life, MY ROOMMATE IS DRIVING ME CRAZY is a book that no student should leave home for college without.As a counselor and life coach, I often work with young adults. Whenever they are bound for college, I always recommend this book!"
5,Excellent Paper!,"This is an excellent paper, especially for its relatively low price. The colors print true and bright on my Epson Photo EX printer. I buy it just to use on one side, even though it is coated and printable on both sides. It is an excellent general use paper in a heavier weight than usually available for inkjet printers, so I use it for just about every little sign or project I do these days! In fact, it does just as good a job as the Epson matte finish photo paper I tried that cost twice as much! The only time I need something better is when I want to print glossy photo-prints at 1440 dpi. I wouldn't recommend any more than 720 dpi on this HP Brochure paper since it gets muddy with too much ink. In fact, I get excellent results at only 360 dpi most of the time, so it saves on ink too! What a value! I highly recommend this paper."
3,Sony Legacy CLUELESS~??,"Real simple, guys- you are doing a Kenny Loggins collection to correct any mistakes from ""Yesterday,Today and Forever"" (easy when you have a second CD to work with). Take advantage of increased billing with a 2 CD set. You want to move units- maybe hit all the prime crossover audience that you can. BUT YOU ALIENATED THE SMOOTH JAZZ and SOUL audience with the STARTLING OMISSION of ""LOVE WILL FOLLOW"". A song that AC,R&B,Quiet Storm- any NUMBER of radio formats have LIVED with for the past 13 years or so.....Do any of you get it? Do you? ""Love Will Follow"" is an iconic song. And there was room on this CD, there was room.....And to think I was gonna buy this CD. But what is the point now? Hey SONY, I Cant WAIT for the Boz Scaggs CD that omits ""LOWDOWN"".This CD gets 3 stars from me because- well hey, it IS KENNY LOGGINS. There are MANY GREAT songs here- but if you were expecting a FULL SPECTRUM representation of this artist, THIS IS NOT that package."
3,"Ummm....hello, record company?","Decent collection of Kenny's work, with a few quibbles. First off, the title. It's a little misleading, since I'd say basically everything the man's done has been essential, not just what's collected here. Still, this is a pretty good starting point, but once you've heard this, you're gonna want more. Also, what is up with not including ""The Gambler""?!! It's the man's signature song for crying out loud! How can anyone call this ""Essential"" and yet so clearly not be essential? It boggles the mind."
2,Why Forget Messina?,"A flattering cover photo on a pricey double-disc set that includes nothing over previous ""Best Of"" releases from Kenny Loggins. How many times MUST he re-package ""the hits""? And one can't help but wonder: why are tracks like Vahevala and Angry Eyes, taken from the first and second Loggins and Messina records, played off here as strictly Loggins' material? Just because he was the principle writer on those tracks? Jim Messina wrote and produced some of the best moments that duo ever recorded, yet the only face on this compilation is that of Loggins. Smacks of smug profiteering. I'd much rather listen to a re-mastered retrospective of L&M than ever again hear a note of Don't Fight It."
4,great taste and easy to use,I used this glaze many times and it is good. the coating properties could be better which is why it gets 4 out of 5. very addictive :-)
4,Very good Caramel glaze,This stuff is pretty good. I would recommend it to anyone. It does wear out towards the end of the popping cycle.
1,not at all impressed,I guess I didnt understand GLAZE...thats all it does is glaze the popcorn and the taste is **off** Just not the right taste to me
2,You have to be speedy-quick for this.,I tried using this coating twice in my big kettle machine. You have to be speedy-quick to dump it out or it tastes burned. The first batch was ok with just a little burned popcorn that came out at the very end when I dumped the kettle. So I thought I wouldn't use so many kernals and see if I could dump it out faster. It ended up with the whole batch tasting burned since there wasn't enough volume to push the popcorn out of the kettle as it popped. The taste of the non-burned batch was good but I don't know if I'll use it again. It sure takes a knack to know the right timing. I didn't think clean-up was any harder than normal. I did add a small amount of water to the kettle after popping and let it start to boil and then dumped it into a bucket. I did this 2-3 times and it got the kettle quite clean.
4,"Really good, DOnald is a hoot!","Okay, I firstly don't understand why a hard-core RPG type gamer would review a game like this and call it lousey. This game is not too easy. There are special moves, secret places and lots of fun stuff. The animation and graphics are almost movie quality and it is very smooth and fun."
2,Well I have really seen better games.,donald duck is a crash bandicute wanibi game. It does have all of its own moves but it is the same principle. But if you liked crash you might mabey like this. I would personal rate it 4.5
3,Way too easy.,"This game was way to easy. This game is a game I would suggest renting on the weekend or a rainy day. You can beat the game in probable 5 or less hours. The game though does show what the playstation can do. The graphics are pretty good with very detailed backgrounds. If you like Crash Bandicoot, you will most likely like this game. But dont waste your money."
3,Donald Duck,"Donald Duck is a medium game ok for a new gamer, Ok for an old gamer as well, A hardcore gamer may not have as much fun as a new, or old gamer but they will have some fun playing this game."
4,How Big is a Foot?,This a great book for primary children to learn that we have many noncustomary measurements. A great read to use in a classroom when discussing measurement.
2,How Big is a Foot?,"I read this book to a 4, 6 and 8 year old. I really liked the book. I thought it was a creative way to teach children to measure. The children I read it to did not like it that much. They didn't seem to get that into it. After I read it they said it was boring and they didn't like the pictures."
3,How Big is a Foot?,"I think this book is more appropriate for younger children. The three seven year olds I read this book to seemed to understand it really well, but I don't think it kept their interest. I think that it is a wonderful way to introduce children to measuring, but overall isn't the most interesting for them."
5,How BIg is a Foot?,This is a terrific book for young and older children. It is a fun way to demonstrate why we need a universal form of measurement.
4,somehow entertaining,"i have not bought any other joan of arc albums but this one, ive had it now for five months or so and the lyrics are just beginning to make some sense. they are random, and when really looked closely at, are quite whitty. example: ""all this white bread makes me wonder"" as far as the techo aspect...it does add something to the music at times, but at others, it pulls away from the record. its hard to classify the album into any particular genre. you could place it in emo, you could place it in indie...it doesn't really matter. it sounds good, it holds your interest. realitivly simple record. ill be sure to check out their other two records down the road. mike kinsella who is in this band is also n american football and his solo persona owen. check them out too for a little cleaner voice and sound alltogether. 4 stars."
4,neat record: artistic and infectious to boot,"If you've heard Cap n' Jazz, you know the vocalist. Abrasive and discordant, but somehow endearing as well; the kind of vocals that fit this music. I was a bit wary to try this record because of the supposed techno influence, but it only enhances the catchiness of these songs, adding another layer of music to the standard rock components (guitar, drums, bass) and meshing beautifully with the orchestration. The lyrics are top-notch, too. A serious progression from Cap N' Jazz in that the pop songs are much fuller than they were previously. Some of these songs (this life cumulative, to've had to of, god bless america, etc.) are simple masterpieces that keep you hooked to this record, listening to the record end over and over. If you aren't familiar with Cap N' Jazz, this record may take some getting used to, but it is well worth it."
4,clean,"joan of arc is so clean. clean guitars, clean sounds, colors... its still emo but its fragmented and more sharper when they do it. its not as straightfoward as the old joan or arc release or especially its earlier focus CaP'n Jazz. this music is an acquired taste. one thing about this cd is that i wish they had more songs like ""White out""... other than that just like capnjazz the lyrics are top notch, the smart guitar playing, and the busy intricate drumming with little bleeps here and there from keyboards or whatever it is. its not 303's or anything."
5,Hey' hey' hey' it's the best cartoon sitcom still to date!!,"The message in each episode is a true delight and a gift for the kids to grow on, simply said they just don't make kid shows like this anymore and nowdays it's really needed...."
4,It's Faaat Alllbert!,"The original twelve episodes of this epic series, from the genuises of Bill Cosby, Lou Scheimer, and the crew at Filmation Associates. Yes, at least two of these episodes even feature that elusive ""duck"" character (apparently, a pet of Russel's) that was seen during the initial opening credits from the 1972-'73 seasons. Sure some of the production material used in this DVD release include the iconic ""Filmation Presents"" bumpers (meaning that they used the syndicated, reran versions of the episodes from the '80s where they added an additional moral segment after the musical number to make the episode roughly two minutes longer). Still, the Junkyard Band's all back again to teach a new generation or allow old fans to revisit lessons about the consequences of lying and playing pranks and to use creativity and be careful who you put up on a pedestal as a hero.""HEY, HEY, HEY; buy yours at the right price TODAY!"""
1,"Absolute garbage that pretentious ""art"" types think is cool.","Ignore the reviews below. This is a boring racket. Great example of the negative effects of narcotics on somebody`s creative instincts. If you would like a GOOD Amon Duul album I recommend either ""Phallus Dei"" or ""Yeti"". These are both very good.Take heed potential buyers! Don`t say I didn`t warn you."
3,Amon Duul - 'Psychedelic Underground' (Repertoire) 3 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1969, as it's somewhat similar to the 'Para Dieswarts Duul' CD(see my review). As most of you might know, many Amon Duul releases are simply more primitive sounding than the Amon Duul II reissues out there. Best tracks here are the seventeen-minute ""Ein Wunderhubsches"", the acoustically and electrically played ""Kaskados Minnelied"" and ""Der Garten Sandosa"". Plenty of good heavy drum playing and guitar riffs featured on 'Psychedelic Underground'. Overall, a decent vintage krautrock release."
1,Interesting Experiment,"The quality of the recording is awful, which is not necessarily the weakest point of the album, as a matter of fact it lends aa appealing dusted, kitch effect to the music. The music seems to have been performed by ... semi-amateurs indulging in a recording session - it might be interesting for psychology students to gage the effects of... induced creativity. I do not dislike the album, I just think its merits are less musical than not. Amaon II albums are considerably better."
4,sentimientos a flor de piel. simply the best.,"poseo todos sus cds, incluido el ultimo ""gente"", y aunque este no es su mejor disco (todos los artistas maduran musicalmente con cada nuevo trabajo), canciones como ""me das el mar"" y ""alma de blues"" irradian tal poesia y belleza que se te quedan grabadas en la cabeza y no puedes olvidarte de su letra y melodia. Por supuesto si buscas los tipicos ritmos calientes (salsa, merengue..) este disco no es para ti. FIRST CLASS ONLY.Todos los discos posteriores a este son simplemente obras maestras."
2,Rather boring,"I've always read rave reviews of presuntos, so I bought this one because it was only 10$. I must say that there really is nothing that stands out on this. It is just elevator jazz pop with not much heart or creativity. Perhaps the newer recordings are swell...but I would pass on this one."
3,"A good port....it has its flaws, though.","The camera and voice acting is awful. But those are really the only negatives.Positives: A full, large game that just got bigger. The Hall of Doors is replaced by a nice area, but it takes too long to go to the next level.I don't know if you should get this or not."
3,Rayman 2: Revolution,"This game had a lot of potential however one serious flaw in design made it too frustrating to play. While the graphics, sound, and storyline are very good the load times between sections are unacceptable. Sections are rather small and passing back and forth requires loads > 30 seconds. This wouldn't be a problem if the game was linear and you just went from level to level unfortunately you have to go back and forth between sections quite frequently. There may be several loads in between totaling several minutes of waiting. I hope in the future the developers can design the game to reduce load times and eliminate these unacceptable breaks in gameplay."
4,Great game for all ages!!!,"I just purchased Rayman yesterday after reading so many outstanding reviews. I have played many of the action / adventure games that were popular on other platforms (ie. Mario 64, Zelda), and I can report that Rayman ranks right up there with the best. The graphics are outstanding. I noticed no slowdown and the images are very smooth! Gameplay is great. It won't take long to get used to the controls. In fact, the first couple of ""levels"" are really easy, and were designed that way so you could get used to the many abilities of Rayman. (For example, you will be taught how to swim, jump, use Rayman's helicopter ears, etc). But what I really like about the game, is that I think it will appeal to all ages. Believe me, it won't take long to get hooked on trying to build up your character. The story line is decent and the game is HUGE!!!! Go out and buy a copy if you like this Genre. You won't be sorry."
3,Tough for younger kids...and too many video clips!,"I was in search of a ""simple"" game for my 5 year old to enjoy besides sports or ""shooting"" games. Although the graphics of Rayman2 are phenominal, the game play is difficult for younger children. My 5 year old likes to briefly play the parts that are simple, but most often would rather watch me play.I find the constant animated video scenes annoying. You have to watch 2-3 minutes of video before you can do anything, then after punching out one door, you have to watch another 2-3 minutes of video. The first levels of the game are all cluttered with constant video clips... enough already, just let me play the game!"
5,Great Game Worthy of 5 Star Rating!,"What a great game! I can't put the controller down! My wife has to shut the PS2 down just to get me to go to bed! Thought it might be a little boring (being rated ""E"") at first because I like the ""BANG! BANG! Shoot'em Up"" type of games but this game is great if you like levers, puzzles, and thinking type games. This game gives me hope after the LACK LUSTER launch titles Sony and friends gave us. The graphics are outstanding ofcourse, but the game play is EXCELLENT! The controlls are easy and very responsive. If you like adventure games this is the one for you! HAPPY GAMING AND MAY YOUR THUMBS NEVER GO NUMB!"
5,The early Creole south,"I found this book in a Reader's Digest Condensed Version. It is a treasure to me. The previous reviewer (4-7-06) says it all concisely.Judah Benjamin, is a lawyer in the early south who falls in love with a Creole debutante. they marry, she is consistently unfaithful while he is busy making a name for himself in local and U.S. govt , but throughout it all, their love for each other stays strong, because he ""understands"" her, and he is her ""beloved"", infidelity and all. The historical facts in this novel are fascinating. I'd like to find more novels in this time period."
5,Awe Inspiring!,"One word! Awesome! KoKo changes our view about Gorillas. Koko's emotions seem almost human. I found myself laughing and crying, but most of all unable to move from my seat. The scene after KoKo is told about the kitten is heartbreaking, and should make everyone look at animals, especially Gorillas differently. I will never look at a gorilla at the zoo in the same manner. It just makes me sad to think about these incredible, intelligent, gentle, but yet so fierce and wild animals."
2,Not as good as it sounds.,While I very much understand what Penny Patterson has accomplished in her research over the years with Koko this movie was just a little to dated for me. I would have liked to see this in an updated form including new footage with her and Koko now as opposed to them together in the late 70's living in a trailer with Penny yelling no at Koko every 10 seconds.The thing that really affected me with this movie was what passed for a Zoo back in 1978.
2,Shannon Whirry is awesome but movie not very good,"This movie doesn't make it as a wild action film or as a mystery. The comedy mostly falls flat, the male lead is dreadful and the plot seems to have been written on a cocktail napkin. None of the characters is particularly believable. So why did I give the movie 2 stars? Shannon Whirry. That's it. She is the ONLY reason to watch this one. She looks fabulous and has a great but too short shower scene. The love scene is good but this movie needs lots more Shannon and lots less of everything else. (And although I think Shannon Whirry looks great here I also think they should have fired the dialect coach: I never once believed she was English.)"
3,Amazon has another one for so much less!,"The 2007 Newport Music Festival - Connoisseur's CollectionWarning - search again! Amazon has the same set on another page for $15.99 - unbellievable, but true!...I guess Amazon just saw what I wrote, because now - a few short hours later - the $112 page is no longer there!"
5,Dream's end,"Love reading Diana Palmer books, have read almost all her books ( series at a time). Love that the books are connected together."
1,couldn't finish it,"I had to stop reading this book. First, Curry was verbally abusive to poor Eleanor. ""You wouldn't bring 5 dollars on auction you little chicken"", is one of the kinder examples. The real clincher for me though was how Curry who is supposed to be engaged to another woman keeps hitting on Eleanor. That just turned my stomach. Any sane woman would tell him he's being inappropriate. Eleanor just deserved so much better than skanky Curry. C'mon, he's 14 years older than she is which is typical for a Diana Palmer book.Sorry, I got to page 135 before I ditched it. There are better D. Palmer books out there. I'm not a big fan of hers though. Her approach is too cookie cutter (much younger man/virginal 20 year old) with doormat heroines and heroes who are unpleasant."
3,So-so,"This is one of Palmer's tamer stories, so if you are looking for her usual taut sexual tension and loving consumation, you'll have to look elsewhere. Try ""Lionhearted"", ""Evan"" or ""Lawless"" instead."
4,Pretty good,"I thought this book was pretty good. Diana Palmer is a great writer. You know what to expect, but at the same time she always has her surprises. I liked Eleanor. She's beautiful and hides her beauty behind dowdy clothes because of her mom. She was in love with Curry for so long and after she changes herself, he finally notices her. Eleanor wasn't weak, just inexperienced. Of course, Curry gets jealous of her relationship with her friend Jim, who was just a friend. He lashes out on her and treats her bad. Diana Palmer's stories have similar story lines, but I love these story lines."
5,Loved it!,I loved this story... Although the hero was a big so-and-so it was a very good story. The only complaints I have are Curry seemed vicious throught the book and it seemed to end quite abruptly.
3,Average read,Simple read for a lazy winter day. Love Diana Palmer.She makes romance come alive in her books. Happy reading.
3,Themes,"Anita de la Torre is like most 12-year-old girls. She's inquisitive, talkative, and irritates her older sister daily. A native of the Dominican Republic, she attends an American school and quickly learns that the greatest difference between the two countries is freedom. A close-knit family that grapples with their political ideals in a country where secret police ""disappear people"" who disagree with El Jefe. And the Torres disagree."
2,"Interesting topic, poor writing...","Anita's like most girls her age, except she lives in the Dominican Republic under a bloody dictatorship. Not knowing anything about this time in history, I was excited to read this book. Anita learns her family in smack dab in the middle of the uprisings against El Jefe. However, I found the fact that things such as exclamation points being overused (there was like one every page!"" sort of annoying. However, the author provided some very interesting and intense moments as well. I would have to stay it was believable for the most part. I only wish Anita had been a bit older, for a think it would have been more interesting to have a 15 or 16 year old telling it to us."
1,Worst Book Ever,I Choose this book for a summer reading. I had a list of multiple books. I went on amazon and read the reviews for this book and thought it was really exciting. Out of all the books i had to choose from this one caught my attention. I now have read the book and have to say i am very disappointed. The back cover of the book was way better than what was actually in it. This book moves slow and is very secretive. The author does not give you enough details about what is going on. Maybe if this book was not a summer reading thing i would have liked it but i am now stuck with a paper to write that wont be interesting at all.
4,Before we were Free,"The Story, ""Before we were Free,"" Includes several interesting events. First Sam Washburn moves in and Anita falls in love with him. Second she started not liking him because he didn't pay attention to her. Then she started going through puberty and was hard to manage situation with her family and love life. The things Anita was having trouble understanding is when the SIM barged in the house and Raded the house set cameras and everything. They were trying to find Tio Toni. That was hidding in his ""Casita"" he made. Anita had so many quiestions but her mom couldn't answer to her because she didn't want to get her worried. Later on, towards the end of the story Anitas dad went to jail with Tio Toni and there died for their freedom. There are so many interesting events that happened througho ut he story. I encourage you to read the story and read on more about those other events I did't inculude; those mistirious events!"
4,Gripping Novel,At times the book was a bit confusing it turned out to be a very gripping novel. You felt the emotions and you understood the characters and how they felt. It was very exciting and it had deep meaning about freedom and what it really means. You understood the hardships of dictatorship and the way it affects people's lives.You understood in what ways people under a dictatorship are effected and how they are not. By the second chapter I was pulled into the book and had trouble putting the book down. It was a truly spectacular work of fiction.
2,Before we were Free book review,Before we were Free by Julia Alvarez was a book about a young Dominican girl named Anita. She lives in the Dominican Republic that is lead by a dictator named El Jefe. Anita and her family live in a neighborhood with alot of family and one other family from the United States. They help Anita and her family escape to America one by one. But during a party in their house El Jefe comes and tries to take Anita's sister as one of his mistisses. Anita's dad has to do something before El Jefe takes his daughter away. He decides to do something drastic at the climax of the book.
5,Such a beautiful book!,"Julia Alvarez is a wonderful writer! Before We Were Free is a great book about a brave girl named Anita who must escape Dominican Republic dictatorship. Her father and her uncle risk their lives trying to murder the dictator. This book is so suspenseful and beautifully written! Great work, Alvarez!"
3,Now available in Spanish (Kindle link bounces you to French),"Now available in Spanish? If you click on the Spanish edition and go to the Kindle link, the language switches to French. Not that I mind, but the French edition will not help me with my Spanish class. For anyone else who ends up buying the wrong edition, it is possible to return, but you have to go to a page called ""manage my kindle"" to do it. You can't just review the order under the ""my orders"" area. Hope I will actually get to buy the book. Haven't figured out how yet."
4,Eyes thru Anita,"This story did a good job leading the reader about the struggles living in the Dominican Republic during that era in time. The story was told thru one of the daughters. I felt her anxieties and happiness from her descriptions. At times the story kept me reading chapter to chapter in anticipation of what would happen next. I felt Ms. Alvarez ended the story too soon. She should have described more of their lives in America and how they survived for a few years.I have no complaints about the product, I received it quickly onto my kindle, which I love even though it is old. The only problem I have with my kindle is not having a brighter back light, so I can read it in the dark if I wish, without a light connecting to it.-rose"
1,"In Spanish, not French!","After reading the reviews in Spanish and English, I was looking forward to reading this book. How disappointed I was to start and see that it is NOT in French is spite of being the ""French edition"" and being listed under books in French. I don't want to struggle through it in Spanish, so I'm hoping they really do have a French edition that I can read."
4,Muy buen libro,"Me encanto es un libro pequenito, narra lo que paso una familia Dominicana en los anio 60's cuando la dictadura. Realmente no sabia que eso habia pasado en ese pais, soy Mexicana de 40 y que ignorate pero no sabia, realemte muy conmovedora historia, lo recomiendo es pequeno, y corto pero muy entretenido e ""historico""."
3,Bindi Babes Review,"Amber, Jazz, and geena Dhillon are three sisters who get whatever they want when they want it. Their dad buys them anything they want. They all have the best clothes, shoes, accessories all of the other girls in their school envy them, and all their teachers love them, they are certainly teachers pets. But that all changes when their aunt from India comes and lives with them to help their single dad. The girls aunt steps in and ""ruins"" their lives. She doen't let the girls dress like they would usually dress, she doesn't let their dad buy them shoes even though they have fifty pairs, and she makes weird food...So they try to get their auntie to marry. Does it work? Well you are going to have to read the book to find out!"
5,Great book from a non-judgemental view,"I never thought I would even contemplate an affair after being married to a cheating man. Fifteen years later and I am married to a much older, workaholic, self-absorbed man and find myself very lonely. When I saw the title of this book-""A Passion for More"", it was just how I was feeling. It gives you so much perspective on just how complex affairs for women are. It won't give you a ""green light"" to have an affair, but for me, it helped me sort out my feelings. I would highly recommend!! I read this in just one sitting."
4,Coping with cheating!,"As a hopeless romantic who after 10 years in a marriage that has gone almost sex-less in the last 3 years this book helped me to remove the shame and guilt associated with ""cheating"". I now realize that there are many others in my same boat, and even though we may be married to the perfect spouse, there are things we can not do without and if we run into someone in our same boat, and we connect. ""whats wrong with that"" good book to read!"
3,"Mellow, melancholy and a tad boring...","This is a collection of Miles ballads from 1956-1967. Very mellow, melancholy and a tad boring."
2,A struggle to read,"Because I found the author's book ""Through The Goddess"" so helpful many years ago, I thought this work of hers would help me to understand my father a little more, as well as clarify our rather distant and awkward relationship. However, I have to admit that I am struggling quite a lot trying to get through ""Daughters of Saturn"". It feels very angry and judgmental. If I can just get through Part One, maybe the rest will provide clarity and understanding."
3,Daughters Are Inhibitied by Patriarchal Society,"This would be a good book for women, young women in particular, to read to make them aware of the limitations on their creativity imposed by our patriarchal society. It will wake women up to look inward to their own preferences and potential"
4,A useful concise guide to the Theology of the Cross,"Forde's concise book of reflections on the Hiedelberg Disputation that become the foundation for the Lutheran concept of ""Theology of the Cross"" is a short read that is relatively easy to read, given the complexity of the document that it seeks to unpack (the Hiedelberg Disputation).In in, Forde separates Luther's 29 Theses into manageable chunks that then form systematic boxes to understand each of the unique points made by each thesis. Forde does a good job of structuring his book to allow entry into the complex and often counter intuitive thinking of the Theology of the Cross.I'd recommend this book to anyone who was seeking to gain entry into understanding the concepts of the Theology of the Cross, anyone who wanted a refresher course before diving deeper, or anyone who wanted to use it as a devotional guide."
5,Wow!,What a great follow-up read to Veith's Spirituality of the Cross! Don't read this book unless you're ready to become a confessional Lutheran!!!
5,Best Texas Tree Reference,Excellent reference book for the amateur! I've been wanting something like this for a long time...and now can identify just about any tree quickly & confidently.
4,"good book, but could use photos","Guide books that have sketches instead of photos tend to have better information I've noticed, but photos would really make identification easier."
3,From the Front Row: Live,"Wonderful Sound!!! DVD Video is sooo disappointing, only one poor pic per song, very poorly done on video!!!"
5,Do BE!!!,"This album is being touted as SalemHill's best effort to date and as the album that will place them firmly in the international limelight of progressive rock. With tight harmonies, smoking instrumentals, and the complex lyrics people have come to expect of these guys from Tenessee, this is the album you MUST get this year!"
5,Excellent.,"This book is a ""must have"" for every radiology resident and after residency. I have been a thoracic radiologist for some time and I always tell my residents to read it from cover to cover. It is clear and concise and has the information you need to make the diagnosis in most cases. Besides that, the authors have an extensive contribution to medical literature that gives them experience to highlight the most relevant data about each disease entity, making the reading easy and informative.Great buy!"
4,Almost as good as the first ....,"I feel that this album sort of completes the soundtrack. I was surprised not to see Blondie's ""One Way Or Another"" on the original soundtrack! Georgia Satellites & the Stray Cats (Rock This Town) round it out nicely.I'm not a fan, however, of the versions of LeAnn Rimes' songs on this album (""Can't Fight the Moonlight"" & ""But I Do Love You"") -- the originals were MUCH better done in my opinion.All in all, if you were a fan of the movie and the first soundtrack, I don't think you'll be at all disappointed in this CD. Enjoy! *Ü*"
2,More Coyote Ugly CD,"The songs that are on there are fine, But there were some great songs in the movie that I really wanted to hear that they did not include on either of the Soundtracks. Also, Those LeaAnn Rimes remixes that werent even in the movie are not necessary."
4,Great compilation of songs,This cd puts together a great selection of tunes; they are a great selection for the ipod!
2,More music plus useless crappy remixes!...,"The first one wasn't that good (exept for the leanne rimes tracks and a couple others) but this one's just a shame considering the huge amount of great music featuring on the movie! and the most annoying thing are the remixes (can you say useless?) and the number of tracks (9,without the remixes!).Such a waste of money for the editors and the buyers.How come there's no trace of sugar ray's fly,kid rock's cowboy,tara mclean's it's me or third eye blind's never let you go?! huhhhhhhhh?!.Sometimes soundtracks deserved a more music from CD and they never do it,but when it's useless and without consistence they all make one!"
5,More Coyote Ugly,"I love the album. Just becuase it is great, and LeAnn Rimes is great too. I am a huge fan. Everyone should buy this album, even if you don't like LeAnn Rimes Buy the CD"
3,Good Introduction to world music,"Before I purchased this album I had not heard the music of the Irish band Shai No Shai and their song Caravan. Their ability to recreate the hypnotic mysticism of the North African Beduin is audacious in its rendering and mingling of Celtic voices with Islamic instruments. For them alone the album is worthy of a second glance. Also the first track Mammas by Amaria is riveting but then the album begins to wobble and one gets the feeling of something being ""thrown together"" because this is not the best material that vocalists such as Ofra Haza have produced and you wonder why these tracks have been included. To put people off ? Ofra Haza's incredible voice is always worthy of respect but on this album she lost my attention. I would recommend this album as a cautious introduction to the ""world Music"" scene because it could tempt some to consider the more original featured artists solo efforts."
2,NOT VERY IMPRESSED WITH THIS BOOK,"This is about the third book I've read this year where the story would have been much better had it taken place entirely in Egypt. Instead we only visit Egypt in tantalizing flashbacks. The adventures detailed in the flashbacks would surely have been more interesting than the story we're given. And one more gripe - on the front cover of the book Christina Dodd is quoted as saying, ""A luscious, sexy, Scottish romp."" - which proves to me that she didn't read the book. Yes, the present day action takes place in Scotland but in no way would I describe it as a ""Scottish romp."" Not a keeper. Buy it used if you just have to have it."
1,Did Susan Sizemore really write this?,"I LOVED Susan Sizemore's vampire novels and decided to give her romance books a try. Boy was I shocked. The writing seemed amateurish, the typeface huge and the prose so incredibly purple I wondered if this was the same author.The story? Cleo is the devoted daughter of a famous archaeologist and a spinster. She's in love with a man named Angel. (Sigh). We don't find out much about the man for many chapters only that he's decided he wants to marry her. Cleo is your typical doormat heroine. First sacrificing for her father then for her sisters. The entire first chapter she spends 'needing' and 'wanting.' What does that mean? Also the frequent flashbacks in italics drove me nuts.I cannot recommend this novel. The writing was very banal. I'm sorely disappointed."
2,Same story all over again!,"I have read and loved The Price of Innocence by the same author, have read and enjoyed A Long Ago Night, but this is the same story all over again, but without the emotional intensity of tPoI and its compelling pace. The flashback style is very confusing here, probably because the flashbacks extend to a period of several years."
2,Go for the comic strips,"Umm... hard to really put it in words...this book as an ""ultimate"" collectors item is a bit of a disappointment and at $24... not worth the money"
3,Real Life Hannibal Lecters,"While I didn't dislike this DVD, I certainly didn't love it. What they had was good for the most part, but the DVD was only about 30 minutes long. One of the experts who was commenting on the individuals was pretty obnoxious, and I was disappointed that they didn't include anything about the BTK killer. To be honest, I wouldn't suggest buying this product. If you do however, it won't be a total waste."
5,dbrown,"The DVD showed educational data some of which is not shown on cable channels regarding the behavior of these serial killers. Because of having an interest in these deviant personalities, the disc enhanced the knowledge. Displayed were several legal professionals who are well known in this field making it a DVD for an acedemic library."
2,Not really what I expected...,"This DVD seemed interesting looking at the cover and reading some of the description, but once I got it and popped it into the DVD player, it wasnt really what I had anticipated. The information being told is all cliche. A lot of people who are interested in serial killers would already know this stuff. And its only an hour long. That to me seems way too short of time for a serial killer DVD. So If I were you, Id look for another serial killer DVD that has better reviews and lasts longer than an hour."
1,Dissapointed,This DVD wasn't what I thought it would be. It was more about experts discussing/talking about serial killers not reinactments So i didn't even watch the whole DVD
2,Was not what I expected!,"Was interested in learning more about these actual people and a little about the psychological diseases they suffered from. This is 100% documentery style. Scientists and researchers and psychologists talk through the entire film and you really don't learn much about the people themselves, their life, childhood or issues. Wasn't what I expected@!"
3,Not the same quality as years ago,"I have ordered and worn these shoes for many years. This is my fourth pair. As with so many other things, the quality is not the same anymore. I have had both the black and the brown, and the brown seems to last longer than the black. On the black, the footbed is very soft and the fabric wears away more quickly. Also, the arch support is not as good on this pair as it has been in previous pairs I have bought.They are expensive shoes and I will keep them because they are great for Florida and are my go-to shoes all during warm weather (which is about 7 months); however, their value to cost is starting to deteriorate in my opinion."
5,Instantly Comfortable,"If you want a shoe that is instantly comfortable, this is it. I have worn this sandal since 2000 and thought I would never find another shoe that I liked as much as this. I was mistaken. The Mephisto Women's Altina Sandal is the same sandal and I can't believe my good fortune in finding it again."
1,jumping on the bandwagon,"seriously disappointed by what is clearly an overated memoir. Whilst sympathetic, I can't help feeling that the on going victim role that Maura displayed throughout the book - whilst feeling some empathy, I can't help feeling she has enjoyed playing the victim to herself and her family for years and years. I wonder who the real victims are? There are numerous working class women who go through the same difficulties and who are not from Irish decent - again I suspect jumping on the Irish bandwagon which is a shame as I am sure there is a real story to tell which would be far more interesting...."
1,Not what I expected,"I ordered this item because of the variety of great songs on it. Unfortunately the add did not mention that most of them are covers of great songs. These tracks were not only covers, they were bad synthesizer covers. I was really disappointed."
3,An Ink Guzzler,"Besides being an ink guzzler, I find this printer to be quite picky and finicky. It's not the easiest machine to figure out. I think it's an engineering nightmare. Still can't match color quality of an HP.I'll stick with my Hewlett-Packards."
5,A great printer,The printer printed right out of the box . It prints great in black and white and also color . It is very simple to use if you pay atention . I reminds me of my very old original Epson color printer . The menues are easy to follow . I mismatched some paper and still got great prints . The Ink capacity is small but comparable to most othe printers when printing 8 by 10's . larger prints of course use more . I plan on mostly printing 11 by 17's and the other sizes on occasion .
1,Too bad it stopped working after 3 months,"I have an $830 paperweight.I have just spent 8 hours trying to get this thing to clear a head, and the reviews on the net say it's not going to happen.Good luck!"
1,Terrible Colors,"I used to think Epson Printers were great. I have had two Epson Stylus Photo 2200 printers. The first was new and worked great right out of the box. The second I got used and is still working well. Then I bought a new R2880 (see my Buyer Beware review to read how terrible that printer was). I got my R2400 used from a friend who bought it new. It might be okay for B&W printing, but I am an artist and need to reproduce high quality accurate prints of my paintings. The colors on this printer are terrible. Trying to talk with an Epson tech is a hopeless cause. Epson has made their printers too difficult for the average consumer to use. If it ain't broke, don't fix it! It is a shame Epson does not still produce the 2200 printer. I have had so many bad problems with the newer model Epson printers that I will not buy another Epson printer."
3,Unreliable,"On a good day, this printer can produce brilliant prints with excellent image quality.On a bad day, plan to spend HOURS and LOTS of ink dealing with clogged heads, paper feed problems, and driver issues.Image quality is 5 stars, reliability is 1 star."
3,Intel-based Mac users beware,"The printer may be great, but it won't work on Intel-based Macintoshes with the driver on the printer software CD provided in the box. If you do install the software, you will end up having to call Epson technical support (not a toll-free call, and you may have to wait) in order to un-install the software (the directions on the Epson website are not sufficient). To add insult to a lot of frustration, the Epson rep told me I would have to pay a $9 fee, as the printer, which I had just received from Amazon, was out of warranty, having been made in 2005 according to the serial number. He did, however, eventually waive the $9 and was helpful and patient. After about 15 minutes on the phone (at my expense), the printer did begin printing using the downloaded driver. Considering the cost of the printer, one would expect more from both Epson and Amazon."
2,ZERO points for EPSON customer service,"I bought this printer in late 2007. The original printer printed too darkly. Epson sent a ""rebuilt"" printer which didn't turn on. I send the rebuilt printer back in May.Epson promised they would send another replacement as soon as the received the ""rebuilt"" printer. By mid June, Epson made me send the FEDEX tracking receipt to prove I send the ""rebuilt"" printer. Epson found that they had indeed received the ""rebuilt"" printer.They send me a new printer at the end of June. At which point I send them the original printer which printed too darkly.My credit card was charge $900.99 by Epson on August 03, 2008. Epson claimed they had no record of receiving the printer. I just had to send them the tracking receipt for both returns. they are claiming AGAIN to have no record of the printer I sent back in MAY!!!Epson has the worst customer service that I have ever encountered!!!!"
4,Great Epson printer,I've owned two other Epson printers and I like this one the best so far. It was truly plug and play with no problems. The color photos were beautiful - much better callibration than the R800. I haven't tried printing black & white photos yet but looking forward to that.Only wish the ink price were less expensive ($100+ for a full set)and that Epson would have a recycle program. I emailed them to ask why they didn't but haven't heard back yet.
1,Epson R2400 photo printer,"We received the Epson printer during my daughter's college finals. She wasn't able to spend time setting it up and using it until completing her finals. When she finally set it up to print some family photos it wouldn't feed, then once we got it to feed it went right through without printing. Was reprimanded by seller that waited too long to return. Took to repair shop and they said Epson's are generally unrepairable and I bought a very expensive paperweight."
5,A Very Good photo printer for color & B&W,"This thing prints amazing color and B&Ws.; If you don't need b&W;'s, save the $250 and get the R1800. Yep, the changing cartridges is a pain and it does drink ink, but if quality is your primary focus this is a good deal. It took me a while to get the color profiles setup between my computer and printer (make sure you have the paper profiles), but after some messing around I got it where I wanted it. I found epson luster paper to be great for color and velvet fine art paper my B&W; choice (it's a bit softer than matte). When you buy this, make sure you spend another $100 bucks for the full backup color cartrigedes, it takes about 1 full set to get your colors right (or it did for me at least). But this is a professional level printer, and if you have good shots, this can be your one stop printer.I would describe this as the Porsche of printers. Not cheap to maintain, and has some quarks, but for high performance it is a good value."
5,Turbo Charged Quality,"This printer was purchased to replace an Epson 1280 (our second) which had served us well for years. We were always happy with the prints from the 1280, but it was beginning to show some 'feed lines' and was extremely slow. The R2400 fixes all of that. The 13x19 prints that we make for our art business now take 5 minutes or less (over 30 minutes for the 1280) and the color reproduction is spectacular. The subtle blue/greens now look right and the prints look great. We've tried it on photos as well and it is just spectacular. If you are serious about large format printing, this is hard to beat."
1,Epson R2400 Print Results,"I purchased the R2400 from B&H, NYC. After a brief installation set up, I was ready to print. The images came out streaking from upper right to bottom left. After speaking to Epson tech support I was instructed by them to return the unit because""it should not be streaking diagonally, ecspecially right out of the box"". I exchanged the unit with another one and experienced the same problem. Whether I printed from photshop or iphoto the streaks continued on 99% of my prints (with Epson paper). After trading emails w/ Epson tech. support, I ended up returning the 2nd unit as well. Maybe I hit a bad batch but the R2400 was for me, an exercise in frustration."
1,really nightmare,"If you want to buy this photo printer please give up right now.Because it is really nightmare.It is not printer only sickening also.you can spend kilogram ink,a hundred glossy paper,hours at the end you produce one photo.If you calculate all one picture is 100 usd.thanks Epson"
5,A true adventure of 2 brave females!,"I loved this book, it gives girls courage and showed me how if you put your mind to it you can do it. I normally do not like historical fiction but this book was wonderful. I could not put it down, I finished it quickly and it was like 400 pages, but don't let that change your mind about reading it. Though I think the novel could have been a little shorter, it seemed as if the author made it too long, but oh well I t was great!"
3,Historical YA,"When this book began I thought I would love it! The writing is brilliant and the story was so well set up. I immediately loved our main character and her spirit. Things got a little rough once she left her home in England. There was a lot of information about slaves and how they were treated and the book took a dark turn. Then she became a pirate and the book was very full of detailed information about a pirate and it did drag a little. The ending was a little unsatisfactory for me, I like everything tied up nice. So overall it was a good read but nothing I would keep. There is sexual content: attempted rape, sex before marriage and there is A lot of violence, but the author tells things in a very matter of fact way and doesn't go into too much detail. 17 and up."
5,"Read up me hearties, yo ho!","Taking place in the 1700's, this is the story of Nancy Kington and Minierva Sharpe who are forced to run away from the Kington's Jamaican plantation, after killing a man in self defence. They first travel to a secret community hidden in rural Jamaica. The pirates arrive and Nancy and Minerva join them dressed as men. Amid mutinies, battles, and run-ins with the navy, a strange ship is chasing them! Who are they and what will they do when they catch the pirates?I liked the never ending action and suspence in Pirates! . There was never a dull moment. I'd have to say that even though the language was sometimes hard to understand it fit the time and place of the story perfectly and helped to set the stage.If you enjoy english history, want to learn more about life at sea, or just plain old love pirate tales, then this is the book for you."
1,Kindle edition has lots of typos,"I read this book a number of years ago and absolutely LOVED it. BUT now that it's been put on the kindle, the book is riddled with mistakes that leave me guessing.One line reads ""rooms wanted ventilation and were abominably crowxled"" (location718-725) Context clues lead me to realize that ""crowxled"" actually meant ""crowded"" but it definitely slows down the reading.The kindle edition is inexpensive but poor. Other mistakes I've found include ""is"" being spelled ""ir"" and ""was"" being spelled ""wTas.""Amazon needs to step their game up and require better quality checks if they want ebooks to continue gaining popularity. This is embarrassing and frustrating."
3,Pirates?,"This is the kind of story that I feel would make an excellent screen play, but as a book, it's rather dull. The book is too short to truly maximize the story, and it seems like it was written by a young adult for young adults. There is no deep description and the characters could have been much better fleshed out. I liked the story a lot, and I think there ought to be more piratical adventure stories, but this one just didn't deliver enough details, description, good charictarization, or any unusual plot twists. The whole thing was pretty predictable. The plotline would be great for something like Pirates of the Caribbean 2, though."
2,Lackluster action and emotionally flat,"Poor writing leads to lackluster action in this pirate tale. The plot has a lot of potential, but the writer uses a rather flat, passive voice in narrating it. Most of the action and romance scenes are told in a vague, offhand, emotionless way. For instance, after Nancy, the main character, becomes a pirate, we are not given much of an action scene. Just, ""We leaped the gap between the ships together, ready to fight and die for each other, but the fight was soon over. We had barely engaged, when the company surrendered to a man."" That's the big action scene. Much of the novel is written that way. When Nancy finally meets up with her lost love, the scene if flat and devoid of emotion. I found this pirate tale to be long, drawn out, and emotionally flat. The author needs to learn to write with an active voice, rather than a passive one."
3,Good Idea but...,"There were many interesting parts to this book, the cursed ruby necklace that at first glances always seems to look like blood, Minerva's secret, the murder Nancy and Minerva are forced to commit, etc. Rees had wonderful ideas but it seemed like she packed what could have filled two books into one and left out the depth of the story. I never felt that I ever really got into the story, like i was only riding along the surface."
5,Pirates!,"I have enjoyed reading this book. When I started reading it I just didn't want to put it down!! I think anyone who enjoyed the movie, Pirates of the Carribean would also enjoy this book. For it is adventurous and it still has a bit of romance in it. Miss Nancy is a young woman who is in love with William. When Nancy's father dies she finds out that she has inherited her father's plantation in Jamacia. Nancy is expected to live there now and she is already betrovthed to someone other than William! I like how Nancy gets one of her servants, Minerva, to open up and the two of them become friends. I highly recommend this book to any readers."
3,Katherine Kellgren has ruined all other audiobooks for me!,"I guess Jennifer Wiltsie who reads Pirates! does an okay job, but after listening to the amazing Katherine Kellgren read L.A. Meyer's Bloody Jack series, I'm afraid Jennifer sounds quite monotonous and dry by comparison. Is this how all audiobooks will sound to me now that I have heard Katherine? I hope not!The story is interesting enough, but Wiltsies dry style allows my mind to wonder while listening. This is quite different from the Bloody Jack series, which had me on the edge of my seat. The way Kellgren did all the different voices, accents, sounds, songs, etc. was such a treat.Perhaps I expect too much from Ms. Wiltsie. Perhaps what Katherine did can not be easily matched?~e"
3,Fake Holywood plot,"Good writing combined with decent research on pirates and sailing in the 18th century. But the plot is straight out of Holywood, way too unrealistic. They get captured more than once but they always escape unscathed. No really good guy dies. Nothing really bad happens cause everything miraculously works out at the last moment. Yeah, right."
3,A good story,"Although I am an older reader I found the story interesting, although domewhat fanciful. The writer has an excellent grasp of seafaring terms and the accoutrements of the time. The writing style was smooth and easy to read, but not too juvenile."
3,"poor editing, but interesting story line","see above. LIked the story line, but very poor editing, spelling was atrocious. Easy read, fast plot line nice way to fill some time."
5,Best Book in a long time!,"Finally a book that was entertaining and engaging. I loved it! The character development was great and the plot moved at a good pace. I did find that at the end I was ready for the wrap up about 30 pages before it happened though. Still, I highly recommend this book! A great adventure story that is woven in a way that made it seem like it could happen even though many elements of it are purely make believe. I am very interested in this author now and I plan to read more of her books. The author was good at using imagery and emotion and kept you guessing what would happen to the main charachters. It was original and a great read."
4,Review of Pirates,This book by Celia Rees was really good. It is set on the Atlantic Ocean in the late 17th century. Surprisingly it is more a book girls would enjoy then boys. There are some gory parts that might not be enjoyed. The writing is good and the plot filled with adventure. The author really makes the reader feel that you are on the ship right next to the characters. There is a lot of romance too but not too much. The book is a must read for anyone interested in pirates or the high seas.
4,Female pirates rule!,"This book was so fun! I really enjoyed being able to ""live"" as a female pirate during this time! I know it was toned down since it was a teen novel, but I felt that it was still significantly gruesome where it needed to be and I felt the ending was a bit rushed.I found myself inside the story, feeling what Nancy and Minerva we're feeling, what they were experiencing. I wanted fight alongside them! I also craved Nancy and Minerva's relationship. To be close to my sisters like that would be amazing!I love all things piratey so this was an exceptional read for me!"
2,"Don't Buy Kindle Version, it is loaded with errors!","I haven't finished this book yet, but I am enjoying it so far. What I don't enjoy is tripping over text errors every 2 or 3 pages. Mostly you can figure out the word by context, but it seriously disrupts the flow of reading. To my eye the errors are a result of scanning the text and using OCR (optical character recognition) to convert it to an ebook. A previous review described some specific errors. There is no excuse for such a sloppy conversion job. Even if the author, or publisher, did not want to spend time manually proof reading it, a simple spell checker would have detected and corrected most of the errors in minutes. I recommend not buying the Kindle version until the text errors are corrected."
3,A good read,Nancy and her former slave Minerva flee from their home to join a pirate ship. For Nancy it is an escape from an imprisoning marriage and Minerva wants to be free from slavery. But the plan fails when the man Nancy was suppose to marry is pursuing them. Nancy wonders how he is able to track them down; is the ruby necklace he gave her really cursed? Or are their traitors among them?I enjoyed reading this book because the plot was complicated and not easy to guess the out come.
3,Not horror,"This is not the horror film that the cover art suggests. This is actually more like a psychological drama, along the lines of drug use and rehab that demonstrates a man's guilt of his wife's death in relation to his doings, with many what-if thoughts shown through flash backs. It's hard to get absorbed in this with a constantly changing dialogue which makes it confusing at times. The cinematography stays dull bordering black and white with very little color, probably to reflect the world as viewed from the distraught mind of this character. With that said, this could be interesting if you're into this sort of fare; but if you are looking for a horror film with this ""black caped figure"" this is not it; the figure is only shown like a disappearing shadow at certain times as if to represent the guilt. The idea overall is not a bad one so I give it 2.5 stars (I'll be generous and round up to 3)."
4,Fun to work with,"We use these on long drives or plane rides and they're very fun. They're not too hard, not too easy so they fill the time well."
4,A pretty good book,"This book is an interesting and intriguing fairy tale that many children will love. It is illustrated beautifully...the pictures almost could tell the entire story. This book could also be used to teach what the man-in-the-moon actually is (the rocky surface of the moon), and to teach about the phases of the moon (In the book, he actually ""turns the lights off"" in the wrong order...a waning moon will have its left side lit, not the right.). I enjoyed reading it as an adult, and I would highly recommend this book for all ages."
2,The Man un the Moon in Love,"I selected this title because it was written by Jeff Brumbeau , author of The Quiltmaker's Gift. It is a children's book but I don't think it would keep the interest of young children (3 - 6) and I think it would be nonsensical for older children. Illustrations are adaquate."
5,Get this while still available,"I've never been a fanatic of King Crimson. Any era. But Red has always been my favourite. Not just the music, but the players did played a remarkable playing. Now, once again, this album is released in a special format and 24-bit remastered. The package is very beautiful. Cardboard sleeve like most Japanese LP-mini sleeve releases. Lyrics, which was not included in the regular edition. Rare photos, well I'm not very impressed since lots of documentaries can be found anywhere in the 'net. Newspaper clips, now this is what I'm looking for. You can read news and interviews about Red, King Crimson and rumours around their breakup from that year.About the 24-bit itself, I don't know exactly how to impress since my player is still a 18-bit. Got to get a 24-bit player in the future. Meanwhile, you can sweep these newly remastered King Crimson albums while they still exist."
2,Not worth it,"Unless you are a super fan of Los Van Van and know their music, this CD is really bad. I am a Cuban salsa lover, but this CD certainly did not meet one third of my expectations."
3,Not to my taste,"It is not that this is bad music, but I just could not really get into it. Their newer releases have a more agressive sound that I love with a passion. The energy buildup that their newer releases have, where they explode as the song progresses is not here.In part this may be because during this time period Los Van Van was influenced by other musical movements that were happening at the time, so it has a quirky feel to it. The end result is a sort of acid-charanga sound."
3,Well made but Bulky,"Very sturdy case. Its actually so sturdy its tough to get your phone in and out of it. Great logo- looks great, but it wears bulky with the style clip it has- don't wear it anymore."
1,Disappointed,"I have several Heath aluminum purple Martin houses and wanted to add an additional floor for my growing purple Martin families. I ordered an unassembled aluminum Heath purple Martin house ( add a unit) recently and was very disappointed after I had It assembled. The room dividers were too long and caused the unit to have an irregular shape instead of the standard triangle shape of previous houses. It was even impossible to fit the floors into the unit. My husband had to disassemble the house and cut down all six room dividers. Once he did that and reassembled it, the house lined up with the other floors."
5,Great HO Train Layout Detail..Not a toy,Great little vehicle which is not meant to be a toy to be played with as many posts complain about. These are HO scale vehicles designed for HO model train layouts which adds realism to your model railroad street and town scenes. I have many HO vehicles which are to scale with HO scale trains and buildings. They are smaller than Hot Wheels or matchbox cars and are more detailed than toy cars. All for looks and they are great!
1,Crap product!!!!!!,Sizes seem to be way off on this product. Not good quality. Got this product and it was dirty and could not get it clean. Seemed like I needed to order a bigger size than my normal fitted cap size for it to fit.
2,This is a good Ablum!,"I think this ablum is great. It has all the greatest hits on this wonderful cd. That's why I would like to review it! I know I will enjoy it, & I hope everybody else who listen to it will enjoy."
3,Check ingrediants,"There is one ingredient that can be an issue with diabetics. Can't remember which one. My diabetic mother is fine with this ingredient, so it did not become an issue. The cake tastes like lemon and is fine but not great. The boxed cakes at the grocery store for diabetics are just a good. Not worth the cost and time."
4,retro-return,"two new studio tracks from the masters of the corny/catchy pop song. The first a-side sound very much like it was taken from the design moderne sessions, especially in the dB-esque drum sound. the second a-side is more moody, with those gorgeous female vocals."
4,My Catley loved it---for awhile,"Pet Media Adventure Cat DVD Volume 1: Backyard FunMy cat, Dee Catley Carson, loved it for quite awhile, several weeks. The first day it came I cut him off (TV) after 6 straight hours of viewing!! Then the day came when he looked behind the TV and speaker and lost interest. (Darn, I like to keep his mind active.) I highly recommend ""Winged Migration"", the human dvd. Sounds are more varied and accurate and keep the kitties attention. I did try Adventure Cat on several friends and relatives cats and they weren't interested."
2,Not interested,My cat looked up at the bird sounds then his eyes started closing. Maye becasue thescreen is large he knows it isnt real. I have seen him look at the tv so thought this would be cool for him. We moved closer to the city and he thought he missed the bakyard wildlife so I bought this. Nope it didnt work for him.Too bad I read everyone else liked it
1,Waste of money.,"After the ""Here Kitty Kitty Kitty"" sound track in the introduction, my cat watched the mice for a minute or two, touched the tv screen, looked behind the tv, and walked away to gaze out her favorite front room window. I could not entice her back again, even after several days. The movie ""Catnip"" was more interesting to her even if it was more grainy and the sound not as good. Too bad I lent it to someone and never got it back."
3,I like watching the movie,"My cats go outdoors and we go for walks, so we always have our own adventures. The mother cat of my four kittens watches it the most, she was born in the wild and fears people but she watches the movie, it puts them to sleep or they would rather nap, perhaps it is more for cat or dog shut-ins. They watch Sunrise Earth, on the discovery channel too, but only like intermittently, not with all their attention. Maybe they have ADD, maybe it's the catnip. The movie is very entertaining to me, I love watching it, I wish it had more cats. I'd like to see cats stalking and killing their prey. That is something that would rally grab my kitties attention."
1,like a rip off,"This is not an official set. The ""box"" is actually a cheap piece of plastic that doesn't even form a real box. It's a cut out but doesn't fold correctly. The CD is not rare, it can be found online. And everything else can also be purchased as well. A good way to tell if an item is real or fake is just by the way it looks. If it looks cheap or fake then it likely is."
5,Fascinating Documentary,"I thought this documentary was excellent. During this 100 minute DVD a couple of mysteries are slowly solved. Using archaeological explorations, CAT scans, and molecular genetics (DNA testing) a number of experts set out to determine which of 4 mummies is ancient Egypt's Queen Hatshepsut and why her images were defaced and her legacy erased in ancient times. During the program, the historical background related to who this Egyptian ruler was is provided. A very interesting program."
4,Great detective work!,It is hard enough to solve a mystery that happened a few years ago (like the Kennedy assassination?)but to trace a mummy over 4000 years old and to identify it with modern technology makes makes it looks like an episode of Perry Mason (I wouldn't call it CSI).
5,Amish Country popcorn,"The Amish Country popcorn is very good stove-top popcorn. It really does not matter what color you purchase, as that goes away and turn white after popping. But the flavor remains! I highly recommend this for great tasting popcorn."
2,Not so great,"We had to throw it out. The corn pops up soggy and a bit stale. Something was ""off"" about our bag of it. Hopefully it was just a fluke. Also, we thought from the description that the actual popcorn would be colored, but it's not, just the kernels. That was our mistake."
3,Popcorn,"The popcorn tastes like popcorn, nothing special. It is less husky but nothing speical especially not worth almost $50 total tax, shipping and cost of product."
3,Mediocre RPG,"This RPG does not have a very interesting story to it. However, I like the game system. The gauge of initiative is pretty neat. The game is geared towards young babies. The battles are not very difficult and neither are the dungeons. The leveling of the characters are very fast."
3,Great battle system too bad the rest of the game is dull,"I find it difficult to really pin down what made Grandia II a so-so game. Perhaps if I had played it before Skies of Arcadia I would not have found the story and characters so tepid. It is predictable and at times tiresome. The battle system is really a lot of fun though and it has the exact right amount of encounters. The music of the game is also very impressive. While the game was fun it just lacked any real empathy. In Skies, I felt an attachment to the characters and wanted them to overcome. In Grandia II, I was just waiting for the next fight, as the plot was silly. I would recommend this game if you like console RPGs but only as an after thought."
3,All Meat and Potatoes,"Being an RPG fanatic, as well as a Dreamcast owner, you can about imagine how much i was looking forward to this game.I'm not rich so it was either this or Skies of Arcadia. I bought this. While the graphics are crisp and attractive, the music is enjoyable (free soundtrack included),and the characters are well designed, there ain't much new here.The story is painfully familiar, and the dialogue can be super-corny.The best thing about the game is the battle system.It's kinda like Star Ocean 2, but with a meter system that allows for some lightweight strategy.I like this game, but i wasn't blown away. If you have to choose, buy Skies of Arcadia first."
3,Disappointing,"Like most Dreamcast owners, I was really excited about this game. However, having played it, here are some quick observations:1. Graphically beautiful -- however, you can't interact with most of the objects you encounter in buildings -- makes exploration pointless in most cases.2. Sound good, music bad (the one exception being Elena's singing). For the most part, the music doesn't set the scene, and in some areas is plain annoying.3. Story -- Except for the dual nature of Elena/Millenia (which is a pretty cool idea), the rest is pretty bland -- if you want a good story, stear clear.4. The battle system kicks some serious hiney --for that reason alon, get this game."
4,wow,"WOW!!!! Thats pretty much all I had to say about this game.I just could not believe the graphics, Sound, And anything else that goes into a game. The only thing that dragged this game down was the never ending cussing from the main character. Besides that, It was GREAT!!!"
2,Zeiram DVD,It seems to be a DVD encoded from a VHS feed. Not true DVD clarity. Never saw a real DVD with VHS snow and artifacts.
2,not worth watching,"I liked the original.. The script was better and the acting was more realistic.. Zeiram II is better in the sense of special effects but the story line and characters are lacking... In fact, at one point, I thought it was the PowerRangers all over again... All in all, I would purchase this movie ONLY as a last resort... or if you wanted to support live ANIME funding.... Otherwise, stick with the ANIME version...."
5,Still amazing,"I just bought my third copy of this amazing book. I first read it nearly 30 years ago, when it had been re-released in paperback, and had the presence of mind to buy a second copy. One copy is now gone, and one is in tatters. This is a book to which I return when I need my spine stiffened and my resolve strengthened. It makes me laugh, it makes me cry, and it makes me think. The people in this book are as real to me as if I had met them in person instead of in Ms. Davenport's words, and I constantly return to visit them, finding new and interesting aspects of each character each time. I am grateful for Marcia Davenport's presence in my life, and grateful that I found another copy of one of my all time favorite reads!"
4,A Classic Re-visited,"I've always loved the movie Valley of Decision with Gregory Peck and the incomparable Greer Garson. I first read the book in the 70's, and I guess I thought I liked it. This time around, I found the ""heroic"" characters to be much more human than I remember, acting out because of social norms rather than any deeper understanding of truth. I still enjoyed learning about Pittsburgh society, the Irish immigrant situation and the early steel industry. A good story, lots of interesting characters.The fact that I could get my own hardcover copy of the book for just 88 cents, and so quickly too, was a great incentive to buy it. I do wish there were more stories like this one out there."
5,Valley of Decision,My book club chose this for our selection and I loved the story especially since I am a Pittsburger. The characters are so very real. Had read it before and will read it again.
2,Valley of Decision,"I received a new copy, not the one I expected when the description did not read ""soft cover"" nor had original copyright date along with the recent one in the description. On the other hand, the book was printed well AND it was a USA University Press. So, I will forgive you."
2,A good historic look at social taboos in the 1940s,"Valley of Decision is a book about the forbidden love between a steel magnate's son and the family's Irish-American upstairs maid. But it's not at all romantic because the star-crossed lovers are caught up in maintaining the strict and rigid separation between the rich and the poor, the served and the servant. Neither character can get past the social taboos and find happiness in each other's love. But the book is still compelling and worth reading to understand just how conventional and rigid the lines between the classes still were, so recently. It could be rewritten today, with gay or married would-be lovers who can't overcome social pressures and let themselves be happy. I'd read it again, and I can't say that about most books I read."
4,Our clever boy Danny struts his stuff,"I am a huge fan of Danny Drennan's bitingly hilarious 90210 summaries (www.inquisitor.com), and so I've been excited for a while about the prospect of this book. Danny's observations are always precise, slightly off beat, and painfully true. His stream of consciousness writing makes you feel as if you are on the receiving end of a coffee date from heaven. This is a great book for anyone who has lived in a city, or contemplated it, and wants to experience first hand the hilarious torture that is Manhattan."
3,Good music for the holidays,"The music on this CD was good. I especially liked song #2. This is a good cd to listen during the holidays. I like Jeff Majors music, it is so inspiring."
4,Beautiful cd,"Jeff Majors bring the joy of Christmas through his music. The sounds of his music and him playing the harp, this cd will take you into the spiritual realm of the real meaning of why we truly celebrate Christmas."
4,"FINALLY, A BOOK THAT REALLY TEACHES & IT'S EASY","I'VE PURCHASED A LOT OF BOOKS TO TEACH ME COMPUTER PROGRAMS. THIS ONE MAKES IT EASY TO LEARN ""OFFICE 2000"" WITHOUT PAIN OR FRUSTRATION. IT'S USER FRIENDLY WITH LOTS OF PICTURES, LABELS AND EASY STEPS TO FOLLOW. IT'S A WINNER, BUT DON'T LET YOUR FRIENDS BORROW IT!"
4,Probably not for the casual Bat-fan,"In general this is not a very exciting story. There is not a great deal of action and most of the story is given over to character examination. This is diffently not a book for the casual Batman reader, although anyone who feels they have a basic knowledge of the the Batverse will probably enjoy seeing the character developments. While this book is not a great story by itself, it does deal with a major change in Gotham, one that includes the loss of a major character, and something that is still effecting the comic line today."
4,Just received it - didn't realize how small these are.,"The packages are marked 2oz (56g). That's 2 1/4"" x 1 3/4"" x 3/4"", or 57x45x18mm.Haven't tried using them yet, so can't comment on the quality."
4,Lehar: Die Lustige Witwe,"This was a well-acted, well-produced and well-directed film of the famous operetta. The singers all had marvelous voices, and the costumes and scenery were very good. My only objection was that some of the dancing was rather risque for my taste. I would hesitate to show this film to anyone under 20 years of age."
5,Great travelling pants,"If you are thinking of going on vacation (perhaps in Europe) and want to look sharp day in and day out with minimal effort, then these are great pants for that. You can wash them every night, hang them up, and they will be completely dry and wrinkle free the next morning. The material wears very well, and the front and back creases look factory new for years (yes years.)I would recommend the dark heather charcoal color as it is a dark enough gray to feel well dressed for most any occasion."
3,Docker action slacks,"These slacks are listed as Dockers Men,s action slacks by Levi Strauss. They are not the same as Levi Strauss action slacks."
1,Wrong size sent waiting for an exchange,I am very upset that I received a wrong size not even close to what I ordered. Now I am waiting for an exchange.
2,Color was too light,"We too wish the Levi-strauss Action slacks were still available. We ordered these in the heather gray, and the color we received was much too light. Evidently they don't make the darker gray any more. We had to return them."
2,Dockers Mens action slacks,I ordered a black and a blue pair of the Dockers levi action slack. The male part of the fastner fell off the Black pair the first time I wore them.I was disappointed that the quality was not as good as they used to be.
1,Disappointing,The cut of these pants makes them feel as if they are at least a size too small. They are uncomfortable.
5,Housewife,There was initial confusion in receiving my order as my name is somewhat common. It took about two extra weeks. When I got the slacks they were exactly what I wanted and will probably order again.
3,GOOD BUY,"These are great dress pants much cheaper than in the store!Good service and the speed of delivery is great.However, I bought one black and one blue-same size-same style-same maker-but different sources. The blue fit fine but the black seemed to be smaller in the waist. I had to have them altered! That cost $12.00 more. Wrong sized??"
4,Awesome Pants,"These are some awesome pants but I say this because I have wore them for over 20 years. I bought a pair here cause I saw a color that I have not seen before. As it turned out, they have the same color list twice but different. I received MUCH BETTER service and quality from another site....www.bennettsclothing.com They are who Ive always bought from and will continue to do so."
5,"Yes, Uplifting Trance!!!","This CD really is pure Trance bliss. Pure, uplifting , ethereal, smooth, melodic and everything else the first reviewer said. Pure trance beats here!! If you love trance music that is beautiful and has that certain ""Uplifting"" sound, this is it. Alex knows how to put some quality trance music together and keeps it going through out the whole cd. Driving bass, soaring synths, non-stop beats, lovely female vocals. Go and get this!"
2,"Inexpensive, poorly made","I wanted a cheap, easy to put together bird house, and this product delivered. I thought that the pieces could have been cut much better, fitting without large gaps."
3,mixed feelings,"Just bought one of these processors. Needed to chop up 16 cups of onions and celery for a picnic. Found out that 5cups doesn't mean anything. The first thing that went in was one green pepper. By the time I got it ALL chopped up, I had soup. NextI tried onions. The more onions I would put in the chopping bowl, the less it chopped. The onions would jam on the blades or stick to the wall instead of chopping. Finally found out that I could only put half an onion in to get it to chop up nicely. On the plus side, once I did get the hang of it (half an onion at a time) it really chopped nice. Took longer too. Base is suprisingly heavy and motor is very quiet."
2,Should of experiment with the food processor before I bought,"My first try using it was with grating mozzerella cheese. It cuts fine but the disk rattles and sounds like its hitting the side of the bowl. The disk mounts on a tall stem that sits slopply on a rotating stud. The disk starts making noises with every inch of pressure that you put on it.Also, I was sad to find that there isn't any other disks for a 5 cup which I sure could use for different foods.I tried to grate parmesan cheese. The disk makes too much noise and doesn't cut it into very fine pieces like what you buy at the store. The chopper blade is just as worst.The positive is that it comes in different colors and has a strong motor."
5,"Finally, a food processor that works properly","I had almost given up on ever finding a functional food processor. This was my last hope. I find that this unit slices, chops, and shreds beautifully and uniformly--unlike previous units that produced mangled or soupy product. This is a great unit for small and medium jobs, and as a household of one, it's perfect for me. If you do larger jobs or a larger household with bigger cooking volumes, then perhaps try the larger Kitchen Aid food processor (11 cup). I've been doing fall apple recipes lately, and this processor has been perfect. Easy to assemble, easy to lock the bowl and lid into place, easy cleanup. I love the mini bowl for smaller jobs like chopping nuts, herbs, garlic, etc. Small enough to keep on the counter, even in a small apartment kitchen. Thank you KitchenAid for the best food processor on the market!"
4,only one little problem,"I started out with the large processor,it took up too much counterspace so I sent it back.Then I went with this one and was very pleased . . .until I tried to order more slicing discs for it.There aren't any avaiable for this size. I was very disappointedbecause the slices from the disc are amlost paperthin (2mm) and don't work well with salads etc. When I ordered a 6mm slicing disc it didn't fit. When I called the company they said, too bad, no other discs available. We still use it but as we are a big salad famiy I am still slicing by hand...."
4,Worth a read,"This memoir by a Russian physicist and poet offers a detailed look into the lives and imprisonment of political and ideological deviants in the 1980s USSR. The book was written soon after her release from prison. As a result, the first part is angry and lacks some of the insight that could be obtained with distance and perspective. The second half is better though and the book is book is well worth reading, both as an inside look into recent Russian history, and as the inspiring story of a woman who went to great lengths to stand up for her beliefs."
3,Too repetitive,"This game is ok though way too repetitive for any long term appeal. I much prefer Command and Conquer generals which keeps you glued for days and days.The missions do not have much variety as all you do is fight in space then fight on the ground, thank god you can autoresolve some conflicts as otherwise it would be way way to boring."
5,The Force is strong with this one,"This game is great. The only real problem is that it takes a little while to adjust to the revolutionary real-time system and the different battle system. It's main strength is that it doesn't have tedious resource gathering and you can jump into the action by building your army and attacking immediatly. But that doesn't mean you can spend, spend, spend. You still have to pick and choose carefully what units you need. The best part is that the factions are different. With the Imps, you have your trademark star destroyers and tie fighter while in the rebellion you have your X-wings and Y-wings as well as a few units not shown in the Star Wars movies. The cinematic mode actually makes it feel like you're watching Star Wars movie."
2,Nice Graphics but no heart,"This is just more of the same Real Time Strategy gaming we ahve seen in the past but with a splash of Star War Paint. After a few games it is hard to tel the difference between space and groudn combat. You go thru the same motions, every thing is played out on a 2D battlefield (yes the graphics are 3d but the play area is only in 2 dimensions). This game is a big improvement over the last attempt (Star Wars: Rebellion) but suffers form the same plague. IT RELIES ON ITS STAR WARS THEME far too much and doesn't focus on playability.Bottom line: Save you money or get Lord of the Rings Battel for Middle Earth II. Fun, enjoyable, and has more than a handful of unique features that put it above the usual RTS game. Star Wars Empire at War....boring."
