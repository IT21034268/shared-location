1,"not bad, not good either","strong points - the klipsch speakers are great. the subwoofer is outstanding.weakpoints - progressive scanning is choppy. the picture coming out from the component video out shows a lot of video noise when connected to my HDTV. also does not have audio output (forget digital audio, it does not have an audio out at all).personally, i just bought this product for the speakers, i used it to connect to my harman kardon 435 (you have to buy a separate subwoofer amp since the sub amp is passive)."
1,Stay away,Digital input often produces loud static when you go from HDTV to normal TV. DVD won't alway play unless you unplug the unit and wait awhile before trying again. I just hoping there is a firmware upgrade someday. I have never been so unhappy with a major purchase.
2,Video/Audio Out of Sync otherwise not bad for the money,"I have been very happy with this setup (for the money) with the exception of an out of sync issue when changing from one digital channel to another on by cable STB. I have to change the channel on my box to one of the channels in the analog spectrum (1-78) then switch back to the ""digital"" channel to sync the audio and video back up. Annoying and frustrating. This is not the fault of my STB because I don't have the problem unless the receiver is in the mix."
1,Frustrating piece of equipment,"I had two of these DVD players break down in the span of 6 months. The first system ate our DVDs. One got stuck in the changer and it cost quite a bit to get it fixed. Then it broke down altogether, and would not read any discs. We got a replacement because it was under warranty. The second unit had the front panel break off. Still worked okay for a few weeks, but then the DVD started skipping and freezing. The audio and video were not in sync. The DVD tray would no longer open. Sent it in to the mfr at my expense and was told it could not be fixed. Don't waste your time and money on this system!"
3,Not Hector's best album.,"This was not Hector's best or strongest album--1997's ""Nuevo Amanecer"" and 1999's ""Salsa Por Todas Partes"" were much better than this one on all counts. The best songs on this one were ""Tomame O Dejame"", ""Mujer Prohibida"" and the title track. While no match for yesteryear's legendary soneros (Adalberto Santiago, Cheo Feliciano, Tito Rodriguez,etc.)Hector is one of the best singers of his generation--unfortunately, this album's material leaves much to be desired in comparison to the two above-mentioned CDs and his solo debut ""Clase Aparte""."
4,strange and beautiful,"This is a strange yet hooky album, not easy listening at all, but when it gets you, it really gets you, but if you enjoy Cornelius, this is as good as it gets.now go and buy some pizzicato five while you are at it, music does not get much groovier than them."
4,Sugar Buzzed Pop,"First, everyone should stop comparing Cornelius to Beck. Second, Although Fantasma occasionally gets too sugar-sweet poppy for its own good, the rest is awesome. ""Clash"" and ""Free Fall"" are some of the best pop songs I've ever heard."
4,[(#i=3.14159--*x\PP)+5n]=,"This is the sound of Cornelius. Wait, you cannot hear it; but if you could, you would probably think that his style is viscerally obtrusive. Surreal, and though at times sweatingly offensive even to the physical senses, it is all still strangely addicting. It reeks of intelligence, and too much time to perfect itself. I suggest a listen before you perk your ears too high. I suggest a listen before you perk your ears too high. I suggest a listen before you perk your ears too high. I suggest a listen bef"
5,Long Live Cornelius,"This CD rocks. I heard about Cornelius in Select, a british magazine. Blur is totally into him and since I love Blur, I bought this CD. It isn't like Blur music, but it is very cool."
5,I tripped and went to heaven,"This record is where the nastiest beach assault in the Japanese invasion is to be found. Stop buying soundtrack compilations. ""Fanatasma"" is worth any ten American mainstream albums. 123456, 123456!"
4,"an excellent cd, for techno","Alright, I admit. I hate techno. I like Moby but other than that... Who can get into the Chemical Brothers just standing behind their systems in concert, and everyone else's music is so cut and paste. Cornelius is different though. This guy sounds like a band that simply does techno mixing rather than the full electronic shebang. Star Fruits Surf Rider has a nice flowing melodic guitar with vocals that complement perfectly. Mic Check is a kaleidoscope of noise hitting you from all angles. 2010 has a nice classical feel to it. So clearly this cd experiments into all ranges of music. My only grief with this cd may be the song Count Five or Six. Who honestly wants to listen to 3 minutes of someone counting from 1 to 6 repeatedly then from 1 to 4 then back again. Maybe there's something to that i simply don't get. Bottom line, this project comes out sounding more like a japanese rock band than a techno band and the result is definitely enjoyable."
3,What a joke,"What a joke ! This CD is not music, it is not sound, it is even not noise...it is nature."
1,High School Experimentation,"This stuff is really bad audio quality, probably recorded on a Tascam 4 track or something. Much of it is juvenile experimentation and awkward noise. Pretty bad."
1,NOT as pictured!,"The Zen box and sand are exactly as pictured BUT the ROCKS you actually get are NOT! I recieved over 16'ish bits of minature rocks. NOT THE KIND OF ROCKS you would use in a Zen garden. Typically, you get 6-8 rocks MAX and the rocks are of small, mid to large size so you can get creative with less pieces; and do so with interesting rock formations NOT bits and pieces. Pieces so small they were hidden under the sand. If you made the mistake and purchased this kit, you can always toss the rocks and go out and find/buy more appropriate ones. Mine has been on the shelf collecting dust until time presents itself so I can go out on a rock hunt!"
2,Good Concept / Bad Delivery,The idea was great but the characters never seem to draw you in and make you care. I was hoping for more detail and more emotion. It was a good light read and well written but there needs to be a bit more development in the characters.
4,Wonderful Story,As I read the book--it really had me in suspense--I kept trying to figure out how Samantha and Rachelle were linked together. I also loved the part where her family was very protective of her. But when she took off and flew to New York by herself--being blind-trying to find out what happened to Rachael--I was just knocked off my feet. The twists and turns of the novel really had me going. It is definitely a page turner and a must read for a book club--I am suggesting that my book club read this novel. I commend you on doing such a wonderful job with the novel and I really think a movie should be made out of it. I give your book a thumbs up and will also recommend it to my friends.
3,not bad but could have been waaaaay better!,"the only reason I read this book is because it's written by the author ellen conford. I thought if she could write good books like Anything For A Friend she'll master this one...not really. It was funny and all , but it's sort of rushed.I am disappointed at ellen.still you might like it , cause I did. I just didn't love it.hobie has a crush on darlene. It's obvious she's in love with his poem more than him.he doesn't know why she wants him to write her so many poems until......I'll give too much away if I tell you why. Honestly , it's not a bad book, I just think it could have been more better."
4,Good family fun,"This is a great tool for Thomas enthusiasts. It teaches good skills such as turn taking, not always winning, (sometimes Diesel wins...not even one of the players), and adherance to rules. Child follows picture clues. My son is thrilled to be holding the gold dust and helping Lady!"
2,Complicated set-up doesn't match age level,"My son loves Thomas and likes this game, but mostly because he loves the Thomas characters. The game is hard to set up: 6 trains that go to 3 different locations on the board, 8 piles of 4 small token cards. This complicated set up isn't appropriate for the age level that this game is for (and I would be surprised if any child over 5 sustained an interest in this game). The game itself doesn't make any sense; trains just wander around the board while the player tries to find gold dust cards and track to rescue Lady. All-in-all, disappointing."
5,Fascinating and Mysterious,"Reading this gives you the sense that there is something out there that you fail to understand. It makes a reader not want to stop, but also is frustrating because it can feel as though one is missing larger themes. Regardless, this is one compelling book. Stan Carlisle's rise and fall say a lot about what lies in men's hearts and what they do to get ahead. Particularly noteworthy about this novel is Gresham's ability to mix sleazy showbiz with post-WWII psychotherapy intellectualism -- kind of a carnival mixed with the cult of Ayn Rand."
5,Step Back In Time,"One of the best movies ever made. Wonderful look at life in the Lower East Side during the massive immigration waves. I've watched the movie several times over the years. I bought it for my granddaughter, so we can watch it together."
3,It was pretty good,The Tennessee Bird Watching: A Year-Round Guide was okay. It is a short version of all the birds that doreside in our area. Would have liked a more comprehensive guide. A female to male side comparison wouldbe good as the sexes of the birds seem to make them different birds. Good for a starter book.
3,Good quality but expensive,Good quality yes but pay 40 dolars for just a pair of scissors is simply non sense. Use a normal one and spend the money in taping (another thing expensive...)
3,OK but don't last.,I purchased these scissors along with some tape but the special coating seems to have worn away within two months of use. I only use them to cut the kinesio tape; which I did about twice a week. They were good until the special coating wore away; now they're good for cutting paper.
3,sounds like the cult,"When I first heard the song godless I thought the cult came out w/ a new cd and sure enough I was wrong. It was UPO, a band that's singer sounds very similar to Ian Astbury of the cult. The Cd isn't that bad considering that I thought it was one of my favorite bands. You gotta give a listen to see if you like it. In my eyes it's a mixed bag. Personally there are a plethora of bands out there that blow this into the water like the new Nothingface(Violence). I like my music w/ a lot more emotion and strength than this offering gave but if you like more of an alternitive, mtv friendly sound give it a go. Cult is money when it come to 80's."
4,Good Album,"The Circle of Life song Rocks -- HARD!!!I stumbled on it while looking for a different song, and it grabbed me instantly!! so i checked out the rest of the album and ended up liking 6 of the songs in total. That's pretty darn good for an album sitting in a section i would never visit in the store.Of the 6, there is a sense of someone desperately clutching to what remains of sanity and order amidst the maelstrom. It's there, and we can enjoy it. I can imagine many of these tracks finding spots in movies."
4,"just awesome , and for the naysayers just shut yer piehole","man , let me start by saying . yes , these guys modeled themselves after everyone else and also modifyed it creating there own music . after all , that's what half of music is recycled but modifyed . well , these guys did no injustice to the music they created . hence , ""godless"" . just put it there . there good . yes , they sound like a hybrid between soundgarden , alice in chains , and stp . but , i love all them bands and they have all disbanded and this is all there own music . you people are fools if you don't like this album . it just straight ""rocks"" , godless aside which to me i could do without . i love ""my life "" , ""dust "" , and ""shame"" ,and the standout is ""catch the sun"" . if your a rocker check this cd out and you'll agree . can't wait to hear your feedback . jimbo"
3,Only good if you like covers,"The songs musically are pretty good, however, these are not the originals, they are all covers of popular hits. The main lure is the hot cover boy. Boys, skip this if you want the original hits you heard on the radio or in the danceclub!"
5,Have a little taste of Hell on Earth,"Remember when ""alternative"" meant something? Well, Exit magazine meant a little more off the beaten (and maimed) path. This book contains some of the most subversive and anarchistic pieces of trash to ever come off a printing press. I do not believe this is what Gutenberg had in mind with his invention. To be read with an open OR closed mind, I'm sure the authors could care less what you think!"
2,Poor quality light,"I like the design and the compact size but it puts out a very poor quality light. The light pattern of bright bands of light with dark areas in between the bands is very disturbing. This could be easily corrected with a white frosted mantle. I tested this with a piece of white translucent shopping bag and it was a big improvement. With the lens cover, it gave a nice even light and it actually looked brighter. I wrote the company but they wern't interested in making any changes to the product. That's too bad because it really improves the product."
4,Great used as a Bright Night Lite,This will work best as a night light. I use 2 in my camp trailer and it is perfect for continuous light in the trailer with it's long battery life.
2,Not so bright as expected,"I recently got one of this thinking that would be a great lantern in a compact size, especially for my tent. Considering my previous experiences with some others Brunton products, including a propane/butane lantern I thought this was the solution to have a decent and a free-burn light inside my tent. Considering it is a led lantern I didn't expected a very bright light, but anticipated something nice. Quite disappointing when turned on; now I understand why it lasts up to 250 hours (because a very poor quality light)."
5,Ayurveda,This is an excellent book in learning an ancient healing system and using it in our daily lives. Vasant Lad is a expert teacher.
5,Get your pulse right,"this was a gift for a friend, they loved it, they are into martial arts, eastern medicine."
1,Absurd,"If you are new to this topic, I believe this book will not help you very much. It is too esoteric and too complicated. For me it was a waste of money."
5,The second best Come record,Eleven: Eleven is better. But that still makes this one of the top five records produced by ANYONE in the decade of the 1990's. Buy it now.
1,Don't buy this book !!,"I was mislead by the positive reviews on this book and bought this book. The author just gives pages and pages worth of code, but does little to explain the concepts. The book has more than 100 pages on Javascript !! I know Javascript is great, but not in a servlet book!!. It easy to lose interest in the author's style of writing. In my honest opinion, there a lot of grammatical errors. The CD is worthless.Stay away from this book."
2,Decent book but too many typos,"To be fair, I will first say that this book is very good at capturing a large amount of knowledge related to J2EE, specifically JSP, Servlets, and EJB. However, my general feeling is that this book isn't the best at explaining the concepts behind said technologies. The explanations are not bad, but much better ones do exist (e.g., Core Servlets and JSP...although this book does not cover EJB). My biggest problem with this book is that it contains many typos. In fact, there are bugs in several of the code samples (even the files on the enclosed CD). Obviously, the code was not compiled and tested beforehand. Furthermore, errata listed on the publisher's webpage is suspect."
5,Are you a web programmer? Want to move up to Java?,"This is the book!I consider myself a seasoned asp/vb programmer. Having done quite a number of projects on them, all involving 3-tier architecture, I always want to know what's the hype surrounding Java thing.I've tried some books on this subject, even went as far as taking a night class, without any clue what I can do with this language.Few weeks ago, I decided to give this book a chance. I never look back ever since!Unlike most Java books that only throw you the pieces of the puzzle, this book has the glue to almost all of them. And some missing pieces too if you consider the real-world examples.Highly recomended!"
3,Good but obsolete,"Last year, I would have given this book 5 stars. After all, it is the best servlet/JSP book ever written (covers Servlet 2.3, JSP 1.2 and EJB 2.1) with advanced topics not to be found in similar books. However, the current versions of Servlet is 2.4 and JSP 2.1 is about to be released. Not to mention that EJB 3.0 is on its way.I would recommend would be readers to wait for the next edition."
5,A must have for all serious web devlopers,"This book has exceeded all my expectations by far in underscoring important real-life developer¡s problems and solutions. It includes many solutions and behind the scene explanation of many servlet/JSP technologies that are not found any where else. I am also impressed by the ease of learning of an almost complete array of servlet/JSP technologies as it pertains to web development. Having read many books available in JSP technologies, this book is a must have for all serious web developers who wish to apply JSP technologies daily."
2,This book is a total disappointment,"After reading all the positive comments, I bought this book. After reading it, I was totally disappointed.The writing style is good, but technically this book is weak and full of errors. There is no doubt that the author never tested the code. The code listing on the CD rom is just a bunch of text files ending with with .txt extension. The book is no more than a copy & paste of stuff taken off the net. For example, to explain the BMP entity bean, the author used a ProductBEan example, in the ejbLoad() call, the product ID member field was used. But does the author understand the ID field must be set somehow? This is done in the ejbActivate() call in SUN's online tutorial, but in the book the ejbActive() is empty. Clearly, the author does not understand the life-cycle of ejbs.So if you are looking for a J2EE book, look elsewhere, if you are trying to learn some JSP, it may offer some help."
2,"""4"" for content, ""1"" for execution","Ouch! If there is a book out there with more typographical errors, i sure haven't seen one. This book averages one error per two pages. I won't blame the author for these errors, as they should have been caught by the editors and proofreaders (SHAMELESS PLUG: New Riders, i'd be happy to proofread any book for you).As for actual content, WOW! It's one of the top five java books in my library.If you can tolerate reading a book that has a plethora of typos, this is a book for you. otherwise, maybe wait until the 2nd edition.."
1,Examples for the EJB and servlet don't work,"I tried to run those examples included in this book with the same versions of tomcat and jboss as used by Budi, but i always got some errors; the one that still makes me scratching my ass is the tassie online bookstore, i kept receiving ""[Root exception is ava.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory]"", even with every possible .jar from jboss/client/ is included in the classpath."
4,Java`,"JAVA FOR THE WEBWith Servlets, JSP and EJBBudi KurniawanPUBLISHER: New RidersREVIEWED BY: Barbara RhoadesBOOK REVIEW: Servlets, JSP and EJB - know what these mean? If not, check out Chapter One for a definition of servlets and JSP and Chapter 28 for EJB's definition. This book is definitely written for a programmer of web sites rather than a WYSIWUG user. It contains lots of already written code and does provide definitions of terms all through the book.The CD contains some of the files so you can work through what is being discussed. 33 Chapters and 7 appendices give one more material than can be read and understood in one sitting.If you want to learn more about Java and how to program with it, add this book to your library."
1,Awful - do not buy,"These cat liners are terrible. They are not a litter box shape (square) but instead are shaped like normal trash bags, which does not work well for the litter box.There is no drawstring so you cant ""cinch up"" the litter.The plastic is very thin and the cat scratches through it almost immediately.Buy a different brand!"
5,These are great on sale.,Who doesn't like the simplicity and tidiness of a box liner? These fit our box pretty good and are a good value when they are priced right. Look for them on sale.
4,Only one problem,"This is a great, sturdy case for my Treo. I only wish the clip on the back for the belt clip could be removed, as I don't use the belt clip. The attachment gets into the way. Otherwise, it's worth it! You can't beat the price, either!"
1,Translucent Clear Case,"This case does not fit the 680 well. It has too many small parts to put together. What more can I say, I can't use it."
4,excellent product,"wow...what an excellent product...people freak out when the hear the ""Creative Wireless"" name...i have a Linksys 802.11b router....and it took me 10 minutes to set everything up...(eventhought that i have WEP encryption in my wireless network)the Creative wireless works like an IPOD....easy to usewhen you select a song, dont espect to listen it inmediately, its gona take about 8 seconds...but not a big deal"
1,Can't Get It To Work,"I must give this product 1 star as I have never been able to get it to work. It could not find the wireless network from my LinkSys router. The troubleshooting documentation is not helpful and the online support refers you back to the same inadequate documentation. The people on the online forums offered suggestions, but nothing helped.Others love the product, but for me it is useless."
1,Warning!!!,"I bought this thing about two weeks ago and still can't get it to work. Creative's customoer service line is not a toll free number. I waited 15 minutes before someone can talk to me. Remember they have no Toll Free number. You must pay for the long distance phone call.When I finally spoke with their customer service, they told me that someone whould have to call me back while they researched for an answer. that was 4 days ago. They never called me back.Final advice if you do not know much about network stuff, don't buy this product!"
5,It works!,"I purchased a different system first and returned it because it would work and tech support could only say ""router incompatibity"". Although this system did not ""immediately"" recognize my network, I went to the second step and used the USB connection to configure and it worked instantly. My only complaint is that the playlist does not allow you to shuffle or rearrange the music. I will definitely buy at least one more unit to add to my system."
2,"excellent in concept, weak in implementation","I used this device for 6 months but the slow performance, clunky software, and intermitted stopping during MP3 play caused me to put it up for sale.Wait for next release of product or buy something else."
2,Initially Great - Ultimately Disappointing,"I was pretty excited when i bought this. I picked up a wireless G router and set-up was quite simple. Had a few minor connectivity issues, but their latest software downloads took care of those.The trouble started when I began to build up my music library. Once I had built my library to about 20GB, this thing really became sluggish. Navigation got so slow and eventually things just would freeze up. Pain in the neck!Now that I have my library built up to about 80GB, this product is worthless. It sits in my closet along with any other failed projects :)In the end, I have to say it was a nice attempt by Creative, beautiful product with a way cool remote control... but they just couldn't pull it off."
2,Stay away until a newer model comes out,"For me, this device is absolute garbage. I was enthralled with the idea of playing music over my wireless connection, but the Sound Blaster Wireless Music is not the solution I thought it would be. Previous reviewers are correct when they state that the remote is extremely unresponsive right out of the box without the firmware update. The update does speed things up a little, but it didn't matter for me because the whole thing just stopped working. But the remote browsing was a lot faster, I'll give it that.I am also perplexed at the fact that sometimes the receiver connects to my network and sometimes it doesn't. And the remote very frequently freezes for absolutely no reason.It's a neat idea, but for whatever reason, it doesn't work very well for me. I wish I had just avoided it altogether."
2,Very Disappointed,1. Product does not work with any firewall.2. Windoes XP crashed.3. Only 802.11b4. No streaming audio at all.This product is not ready for prime time.I am returning it today!
1,What a DISAPPOINTMENT!!,"I had very high hopes for this unit. Unfortunately, it has a MAJOR technical problem right now that technical support has submitted to their testing center. Note: I HAVE applied all *three* of the latest firmware/software updates.Basically, after choosing to listen to a specific Genre on the remote, the unit plays ALL songs from your music library, regardless of Genre.If you can live with that, for $250 big ones, it's a nice product. For me, it's worthless."
5,"Provocative Cover, Intellectual Text","Author Anne Kingston deserves five stars-plus for her exhaustive research and objective presentation of the subject. The Meaning of Wife, which is by no means a quick or light read, is well written, engaging, thought provoking and entertaining. If you are a wife, you'll find yourself somewhere in these pages. If you're not a wife, you may recognize your mother or your friends, or the woman you call your wife.Kingston covers all the bases, beginning with the world's fascination with Princess Diana's foray into wifedom. In a chapter called ""Heart of Whiteness,"" which is what I've always called ""White Lace Dreams,"" she details the wedding dress selection and compares the white lacy dress to the wedding cake. ""The modern wedding cake is a bride you can put in your mouth,"" is a quote attributed to food writer Jeffrey Steingarten. From there, the topics of sex and abuse, divorce and value are thoroughly portrayed. Strong vocabulary, this is academic material.Well done."
2,My College Thesis,"This is very slow read. And why? Because interspersed into the verbiage are so many references to other works it just slows the reader down. It is also very redundant. Retool this book and have a bibliography at the end for at least half of the references crammed into the text. Also keep in mind that a lot of the information is data not past (around) the year 2000. A lot has changed in the last decade and this book should be updated (and cleaned up as I mentioned above). All of which is too bad, because the relevant material, when you can parse it out of all of the academic babble, is interesting."
3,OK--for the non-average woman,"Kingston's book begins with a description of Prince Charles' and Princess Di's wedding and sort of stays there. She spends a great deal of time focusing on the upper classes, whether royalty, celebrities, politicians or CEOs. Ignored, or perhaps forgotten, are those whose weddings cost less than $50,000, who do not have a choice about working or staying home, who get married at City Hall, and who cannot squeeze every dime out of the ex--because he doesn't have that much more himself. Ignored also are issues such as the effect of parenthood on a marriage, same-sex marriages (even lesbians do laundry), and the role that religion has played in marriage.Kingston's book not only focuses on the upper echelons, but the most extreme marraiges. Her chapter on divorce, for example, portrays women who just about break the law getting back at their ex-husbands.If you are an average woman who took two weeks off her job for her honeymoon, pick something else."
5,Great,"I don't want to get married. I thought this book would be an explanation into how I feel. It turned out to be so much more, it does not bash marriage as I originally thought it would. The book is a great read right until the end, so rare in non-fiction. It has many historical facts that are fascinating! Great book, I will read it again and again."
3,"Interesting, but not very academic","I have to agree with the review by Someone's Mom. While this book does provide many interesting and valid points - some which I agree with, some I do not - I feel this book is not focused enough and lacks an overall thesis. The author states many 'facts' and points that seemed to backed up very little other than personal views or opinion (or at least they aren't explained throroughly enough for me to undertstand.) I also feel that there is too much generalization - the author does not give much credit to individual choices & feelings. I am a woman who would like to marry her partner and I feel that many of her descriptions do no apply to me at all.So once again, I don't think that the views expressed in this book are invalid by any means, but they offer little in the way of concrete argument."
5,Wow!!!! Fantatstic return of form,"For a while I have been reading the oversea reviews on Under Attack. It was supposed to be a return to their early rocking pseudo punk form. I found this hard to believe.Not anymore.Hard hitting and with a swagger, this version of the Alarm could likely play the socks off the original line up. Mike Peter's voice sounds really fit as well.I was dissapointed with their last album which was billed as a return to form. This is actually the real return of The Alarm."
5,"Informative, thought-provoking, insightful, practical.","Reading For Understanding: A Guide To Improving Reading In Middle And High School Classrooms is the collaborative effort of classroom teachers and education researchers Ruth Schoenbach, Cynthia Greenleaf, Christine Cziko, and Lori Hurwitz. Part One explains the reading apprenticeship approach in which a teacher serves as master reader to the student apprentice. Part Two describes how the reading apprenticeship approach has been put into practice. Part Three discusses ideas for professional development and helping teachers become aware of their won reading skills, acquire a better understanding of the struggles students are experiencing with reading, and prepare for the role of master reader to student apprentice readers. Reading For Understanding is informative, thought-provoking, insightful, and practical reading for student teachers and has much of value for even experienced classroom instructors."
2,Save your money.,Simply put: don't waste your money on this game. The quality of this game is much lower than many other similar titles.
2,Really bad painting job,"I got mine and it all had a yellowish tone instead of white. It seems they were using a cheap final coat lack that turns into a warm yellow color over the time. Also, there were several points where pain job was really bad and color had an offset from the place where it should be applied. Right boot was not glued properly - it had 2 millimeters distance from the leg, so I had to pull it out by force and reapply glue. On the right shoulder there is a visible molding defect.Verdict: this figure was a really big spoiler for me, considering the total price, including shipping and handling.I'll never buy any other kotobukiya figure, that's for sure."
4,Great Space opera!,"I read this book when I was 16. There is a reason these books are popular, action packed, good characterization and great worldbuilding. The Lairdian Universe is a very interesting backdrop for these stories. If your a fan of the Firefly TV series these books are of a similar vein but the technology is more advanced and not a space western. If its adventure your looking for look no further."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Pretty ordinary secret agent type on the run story. The fun bit is that he gets probability calculations of his likely demise along the way. Basically, Lee is no Fleming or Ludlum.Should appeal more to those that like a romance/action story in a different setting."
1,poor quality,Business cards in this book generally lack any quality of design and would appear to have paid to have their work published...not a good resource if you are looking for quality innovative design...
3,Jorgensen Bar Clamp,Strong and sturdy but the end is forged on an angle which has a tendency to make the piece you are clamping rise up instead of laying flat.
2,Jorgense 36 I-Bar Clamp,Probable the best wood working clamp on the market. Easy to use and easy to clean the glue off of the I-Bar.
5,Awesome,I'm completely in love with this album. I just cannot stop listening to it. They remind me a little of Weezer. Or what Rivers Cuomo would like to be whenever he breaks out of his shell. Size 14 sound accomplished melodicly and just the right amount of punk to keep you bopping. They are certainly one of my new favourites...besides =w=.
4,Author speaks with many voices,"I love Susan Howatch. I have read all of the Church of England series plus Cashelmara. This book speaks through the voice of several characters. It is well done and effective. It shows that how people perceive an individual, versus the actual character of the individual, varies greatly. This novel covers an interesting period the 20s-- through the stock market crash and into the Depression. The ending is satisfying and definitely not what this reader expected. I highly recommend this and all of Howatch's writings."
5,Skillfully woven tale of the beginning of Investment Banking,"This is the story of the struggle for wealth and power in the 1920's. The impact of the depression on ""high society"" is made more understandable than any History lesson. The story is enhanced by Susan Howatch's style of changing the character telling the story at each plot climax. The family and events in this book are continued in ""The Sins of the Fathers"", also excellent reading."
4,"The only true ""Science Fiction"" author I read consistently.","I usually prefer Fantasy novels; but David Weber's strong female heroine lured me into this series and his writing has kept me comming back for more. I have to admidt that this particular book is the only one in my adult life to have me in tears from early in the book until the end. As much as I hated the character's death that made me cry - it was not a gratuitous death. This person's death not only defined the course of this novel, but also had a profound effect on the heroine's life and career. This effect has continued on into later books. This is the only time I have seen the death of a lover depicted as a life-altering event. Honor does not morn and then continue her life as before. This death effects her actions in this book, changes the path of her career and contiues to echo into later books about her. I hate seeing such an important character die, but David Weber made his death a major pivital part of the book and Honor's life"
4,Great adventure,"Honor Harrington, together with Miles vorKosigan, has brought space opera back to life. In this, Captain Harrington's military career just sets the stage. Really, this is about the political chicanery, spin-doctoring, and party politics that whirl around a woman with no interest in any of it. Her old enemies have plenty of interest in her, however, as the easy target to blame for their own self-inflicted injuries to pride and career.No spoilers here, but the pace stays strong, right down to the end. In fact, I resented every moment I had to put this one down, once I started reading it. I can't call this great literature, by any means, but it's best in class as entertainment. Highly recommended, if you like your heroes (and heroines) truly heroic.-- wiredweird"
3,The Fall of Pavel Young,"Honor's nemesis manages to survive his potentially lethal court martial for treason, and he sets out to take revenge on Honor Harrington by destroying what she holds dear. The background is political, with a pending war pushing for compromises that Honor isn't willing to make.Overall, an average offering in the series. Pavel's efforts are rewarded mid-book and Honor spends about 100 pages going through a purple prosaic depression. The depression is almost out of character, and Weber went overboard on the metaphoric 'armor of ice' emotional descriptions. The writing could have elevated the story, but instead it sinks it into 'average.'If you like the series, you'll like the novel. Not a stand-out book."
4,Good read,Very entertaining even though there are no space ship battles. Really focuses on Honor's character.
3,A good read,"But the plot(s) and character(s) are simply trite and boring. Honor is just way too good to be true, and all the problems she face are external, which makes the story very straightforward. Turn your brain off when you read it"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Less spaceships blowing up, more political infighting. Honor has an enemy who is now in disgrace. Her society, with all its advancedtechnology and space fleets, has duelling. Said enemy manoeuvres Harrington's bed warmer into such an event, to get back at her. This is where I started to lose interest in the serious. Definitely more on the melodramatic side, with dastardly villainous types and whatnot."
2,Arguably the worst of the Honor novels,"The Honor series is fun to read... if unoriginal in character (see Hornblower or Aubrey), and a bit heavy handed in the writing style.This book, however, lacked the flow and purpose of the other books. It seems out of place, as are the motivations of the characters. Perhaps Weber needed a ""transition"" novel to provide a ""break"" in the storyline. Regardless, compared to the other books in the series, I found this entry lacking.(NOTE: unlike most, I grade on a bell curve, with 3 stars gathering the majority of votes. 1 and 5 star books are extemely rare.)"
2,Not everything I'd hoped for,"I picked up this fourth Honor Harrington book first, knowing it is a series, but not knowing its order. It was recommended to me by people who said if I like Bujold's Captain Cordelia Naismith and her son Miles, then I'd like Honor. Harrington is more like Pvt/Sgt/Capt/Major Sharpe by Bernard Cornwell than Bujold's characters. Harrington and Sharpe are the perfect soldiers. Harrington has a tough time of it, certainly, but very little humanity seeps through."
5,"Great, cute, retro baby highchair!!","I thought this highchair looked really cute when I saw it online - it was even cuter up close. The pattern is a little brighter than you'd think which really adds to the modern baby girl look. It was definitely a good buy, and my 7 month old little girl loves it."
4,GREAT HIGHCHAIR,THIS WAS ACTUALLY BOUGHT FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER THAT LIVES WITH US. IT IS A VERY CUTE HIGHCHAIR. IT TAKES UP SOME SPACE WHEN SET UP BUT OTHERWISE WE LIKE IT ALOT...
2,Strange Extra Plastic Tray that cant be removed,This chair has this plastic tray that cant be removed. There is the tray that snaps on that you would put food and other items on and that tray has a removable part to make clean up easy. All that is fine. The odd part is that when the main try that you expect your highchair to have is removed there is anothe small plastic tray that can't be removed that makes it so that when the chair is on the lowest level your child can not get themself in and out of the chair. My 21 month old loves to climb in and out of her chair when it is on the low setting. She thinks she is helping. With this odd part there is no way she can do that with this chair and it makes it hard to get her in and out because she has long legs. I would not keep this chair if I had known this before my husband set it up and started using it and got rid of the box. The hard tray also scrapes her legs. I hate this chair
3,Not good for a larger child,"We've been using this high chair for about 6 months. It's been great until now. The tray doesn't pull out far enough for a larger child. My daughter is 13 months and 24lbs. The tray is too tight on her belly. Also, the bar underneath the tray is not removable so her legs scrape against the sides when I'm trying to put her in or get her out. I rec'd this as a gift along with the pack and play, swing and travel system. When I initially registered I didn't realize this would be a problem. I was hoping to get years of use of it but I think I'm going to have to look into another highchair."
2,My 18 month old can take off the tray by himself,"My title should speak for itself. My 18 month old has figured out how to remove the tray and does it in the middle of the meal. He can't help but to it all the time. I have 3 other kids and have never had this problem with a high chair before. (My last one needed to be replaced) It isn't too bulky and doesn't take up a ton of room in the kitchen, but I don't like the mess it makes! Terrible design for the tray."
4,Great for Grammy's house,I bought this for my mother's house when the kids visit. It folds up nicely and has casters so it's easy to move around. This high-chair is a great alternative for the pricier version we have at home. Graco is a name I trust and $70 was a bargain for a safe product.
5,Love it,I have had this highchair for over 8 months now I would say. I love it. I would say my favorite part is the seat covers. It comes with two covers and they have the best fabric that is easy to wipe off and put in the washer. I washed them many many times and they still look like new. All highchairs should be this easy to clean!
2,"OK, but 1 major problem","We didn't do alot of research on getting a highchair and we're regretting that now. The chair is basic and was working great until our 14 month old found the release for the tray. The tray release is easily in his reach, under the part of the tray that is right up against him on either side. He can push the tray off anytime he wants to, food on it or not. Poor design!"
3,Putting Together A Trust,"This product is okay. It lets you make the documents you need for the trust internally, however, you cannot put together the wording for a complete trust. The documents you need to the put in the trust internally are available, but the verbage for the intro and whatever else you needto make the trust complete is a little vague."
2,Weak Handles,"Although, I love the bag itself but I was so sad when only a week after being used I tugged on the handle and the plastic joiner snapped. Grrrr. I bought four carabiners to replace the flimsy plastic pieces."
5,This Book F'ing Rocks,"This book kept me drawn in through out the 11 short stories. It's a type of fantasy horror that I can kind of relate to. I grew up in the same area (I think the same town) as the author. It was graphic and intiseing. I'm probaly not the best person to be typing a review, but I just had to put in my two cents about this book. It's one of the best books that I've read this year. So here's to Derek J. Goodman you write a darn good book and I would like to see you write many more books. So keep up the good work and e-mail me danxedwards@hotmail.com . And if any one disagrees with me you can also e-mail me ."
4,"Disco, pop, dance, and other great themes.","If you think this set is hard core tecno, or the kinda music you would here playing at clubs, you are wrong. In stead you get a collection of fun, heart warming, pop, disco and 60's, 70's and 80's dance favorites. These cds have a little for everyone. Some of todays favorite club jams, some oldies but goodies, from the 60's and 70's. All in all, it's just a fun collection of great songs. For the price you can not go wrong, it's a good cd to play in the back ground when you invite friends over for cards, or sotializing. If you want a good party cd, I recomend the QAF soundtrack. But if you want some fun, and at times campy tunes, then these cds are for you. Not recomended for the die hard tecno rave fans, as these cds will be of a great disapointment to you."
5,The best!!,These collars are the very best for most any dog. It's almost impossible for a dog to slip out of it which can be very helpful with dogs that have small heads. We use these collars for all of our dogs and have for years.
5,This simple device works perfectly.,"Mine arrived in perfect condition. This clamp is very well made and worked just like I had hoped. Jorgensen makes a nice product here, and this type of clamp is really useful for many jobs around your wood shop. I purchased this one to use with the Incra I-box jig (reviewed separately) that I got to make box joints, and it is a must for that application. This type of clamp has many other applications too, so as a relatively novice woodworker I plan to buy more of this type of Jorgensen clamp in various sizes."
2,"Boredom, boredom ... bore-dom","These geezers from Calgary, Alberta, craft some of the dullest music passing for garage rock these days. Either check out other Estrus Records artists for a better idea of what it takes to rock or be disappointed with your purchase"
3,German Chicks on Roids,"Fausts Gold documents what went on in eastern Germany with the ""doping"" of the athletes, in particular the female swimmers, with various roids and EPO. Its particuarly disturbing because in the case of the femlae swimmers, they were given to them without the girls knowledge of what they were taking, just being told they were ""vitamins"", and that some of the athletes were as young as 13 years old. Of course these women all developed serious health problems at a young age, had deformed children, and turned into freakish looking manly women. Of course its not like eastern Germany was the only country whose athletes were improving their performance through chemistry, and the truth is even with the multitudes of examples of people who destroyed their health for short term gain, doping is more rampant than ever now and there are still idiots that believe the side effects of steroids are miniscule."
5,Riveting and Shocking,"It is a masterful blend of high scholarship, investigative journalism, and riveting storytelling by the preeminent sports psychologist. I was spellbound and very disturbed by the personal tragedy, political intrigue, and corruption of the Olympic spirit running through this brilliant account of an astonishing sports scandal lasting decades and involving high officials of the East German government. After reading it, the reader's view of Olympic competition, or any other top-line sports competition, will never be the same."
1,Waste of time,"Simply put, this is a dreadful book. Boring and pedantic. Even if you're interested in the subject, this particular book is not worth reading. The ""Publisher's Weekly"" review was on the money - it's disappointing and repetitive."
4,"Classical Myth, Fourth Edition","Excellent text. Covers the classical gods and heros, primarily of the Greeks, with a appreciable amount of depth and scope. The text also includes a rather large quantity of primary source information, great for a more complete view of the myth. A little pricey for what is essentially a paperback book due to several sections of colored pictures. On the upside, they are nice pictures."
3,good analysis but serious errors,"Powell provides students with a mainstream analysis of the classical myths in this book. However the text has two major flaws which necessiated my using an additional text for my Classical Mythology course. First, when he does not directly sight a document his reporting of what happens in the narrative is sometimes incorrect, for example it does not say in the Enuma Elish that the younger gods danced and thus distrubed Anu and Tiamat -- it just says that the elder gods were troubled and the younger gods were noisy. Secondly there are historical errors and controdictions in the test as he attempts to provide background for the stories. An good attempt at classical mythology but not the best I've seen."
1,Doesnt deal with myths' deeper historical origins,"I can only say, not being a classicist, but one who did study under the esteemed Prof. Edward O'Neil of Univ. of Southern California, that I find it curious that this author does not deal much with the theories of migrations (Achaeans, Dorians later) into Greece that explain origins and approximate dates of certain myths. For example the inclusion of chthonic deities/mother earth deities being early myths of Minoan influences, the patriarchal - sky-god myths relating to Achaeans and their influence by migration on the Greek mainland. I find H.J. Rose better at this for sure, as is O'Neil's work on Library of Apollodorus. Man, Myth and Monument,is also an excellent guide for anyone who wants to follow this fascinating aspect of myth."
5,"Great fit, great shoe","I bought these in black a while back and I am still in love with them! The wedge heel is high, but the shoe has enough padding to keep you on your feet from day to night. Fit is good and leather upper is soft and looks as good today as it did on the first day I wore shoes for the first time."
5,The meaning of comfort and style wrapped into one shoe,"These shoes are unbelievably comfortable. I can literally wear them all day. To the office, then night school then for a glass a wine with frienda and dinner. My feet at no point while wearing these begin to hurt , sweat or anything. I have purchased a few pairs of this brand shoe and i have to tell you I love shoes but all of the naughty monkeys are the most worn because of their comfort. the styles are cute and different. It does not matter which ones I have on I get compliments on all of them. But above all if you like to walk on clouds then these are the shoes for you."
1,Naughty Monkey Women's Wink Wedge,I would like to return this pair shoe. It's not fit me. Please send me a return form. Thanks!
3,Great for people with narrow toes,"I would have loved to give this shoe 5 stars, but the narrowing of the shoe towards the toes detracted my score. The shoe is light, but the feel is constricting (esp. at the toes)."
4,"Needed a bit of finish sanding, but otherwise perfect.","This was exactly what I was looking for, but was a bit rough. But about five minutes with a palm sander and fine grit sandpaper and I now have a cutting board for the next decade or so. Sure, John Boos sells a similar board for about double the cost. But I didn't like the groove design.This has about the perfect juice groove. Deep, very close to the edge. The usable cutting surface is perfect for my kitchen. The wood is beautiful. Clear, tight grain. It smells really good too.Don't stress about the other reviews. A tiny bit of sanding, and it's perfect. Just get a piece of 220 or finer, and it'll sand smooth in no time. The size and shape are just what I needed. And the wood quality was better than expected. And it's a pleasure to cut veggies on it!"
4,Beautiful Board,"As per some other reviews this board needs some sanding,It is however a beautiful board and love it enough that I bought 2,Just get you some 400 grit sand paper and polish her up."
4,I am very pleased with this although it's too bad it doesn't come seasoned.,"This is a great size for a worksurface and I love the little channel around the edge to catch drips. Also, it's heavy enough that it doesn't slide around while working on it."
3,the power of spoken blessings,"I'm totally blessed by reading this book. It emphasises the authority and the power of my spoken blessings. But one thing is lacking is that it doesn't guide me of the ""how to""... And I found a book that is helpful. ""365 Prophetic Promises & Blessings for Your Children"" by Sebastian S. - helping a busy mom like me who sometimes just don't know how to express my spoken blessing to bless the children."
2,be careful with this,"Before you decide to follow this advice, search Bill Gothard on Google. Many mainstream Christians , colleges and seminaries consider his philosophies to be dangerous and even cult-like in their recommended applications. It is obviously a great idea to bless your children, and a Biblically recommended practice. You might prefer another resource to help you begin this habit."
1,Cut And Disappointed,"I bought this CD particuarly for the tune, ""Music Until Midnight"" only to find that it and two other songs had been left off. It should have been noted in the product's ad description that the CD was an edited version with the three song titles mentioned not included on the CD. I wouldn't have bought the CD at all. It's too bad that something like this leaves a bad taste in my mouth making me feel ripped off about a CD that probably is pretty good but won't get a good recommendation from me."
2,Classic camp from the 50's,"This muzak is campy as heck! This is fun as a joke, this is vintage elevator music. it's actually not half bad as make out music9hence the two stars, instead of one). If you need some kitchy background music this is it."
5,Bouquet of Music,"Remember the days when you could turn on the radio and hear ""beautiful music?"" Percy Faith was a staple of this ""good music"" sound and this CD which compiles two of his lush string orchestral LPs,is a treat for the ears.There are many familiar American pop standards given the Percy Faith treatment here, including his hit Song From Moulin Rouge. Other selections include Laura, Deep Purple, Ebb Tide, Fascination, Blue Moon, If I Loved You, and Stella By Starlight. When you turn this CD on get ready to be romanced by an audio bouquet of sound! The only problem with this CD is that three songs from the LP were left out due to time factors. Sad, but what IS on the CD is impressive nonetheless!"
4,Just like high school wood shop,These work great but tend to bow in the center. Perhaps the pipe type would be better suited for table top glue ups.
3,Young Living oils are GREAT - but the seller did not send Young Living to me.,"I have given three stars only because I did not receive Young Living brand from the seller. True Young Living brand deserves 5 stars and I did not want to tarnish it too much.I have Young Living oils and thought I was getting a great deal from the seller, Prairie Frangrances, but I did not receive Young Living brand, I received something homemade and I'm in the process of returning it. I will be leaving feedback for Prairie Frangrances after that process is complete."
3,sax & sex,puts you in good mood for hooker & dude he wasaxman of glenn medeiros in 1993 cd itsalrighto love greatrack ill try written by antoninarmato
2,Outdated,"I ordered this one even though i was unimpressed with the first one, hoping for an improvement. not so much. The book does have some useful ideas but nothing I couldn't have found for free. I'm sure it was amazing, at one time, but seems very outdated, now."
1,"1 x 1/2"" Clicker Torque Wrench With Case",Do not buy from this guy. The torque wrench is a piece of crap. Doesn't click at all. Will not adjust up or down all the way. The adjustment is rough feeling. I have e-mailed the seller about a refund but have yet to received an answer.
3,old but good,the book came promptly and in good shape. pages were yellowed with age but not a big deal.
1,unbearably smug,unbearably smug recollections of Peter Ustinov; you can just see him twitching his lips in self-satisfaction while he wrote it.
2,boredon,"This book is just so boring! I had to read it for my Engish class and did not enjoy it whatsoever. If anyone is interested in Ustinov's plays and movies, where and when they were performed, and in details about his military career will definitly enjoy it. All others can use it as a perfect lullaby."
3,A lot of Nothing,"As I read through Dr. Ackerman's Book if the Great Dane, I found myself wanting more information than what was given. It was almost as if the author was trying to beat a deadline; so minimal information was given on a vast number of subjects. If you are getting a Dane or have a Dane and wanting a book to help you get a better understanding of the breed, look elsewhere. This book only left me asking more questions.The stars given are for the illustrations. It's completely illustrated in color."
1,urban circles duvet,I was led to believe that I was purchasing a full set of sheets with pillowcases & instead it turned out to be whatever a duvet is. certainly not worth $129.00
2,Farming Snails 1,"This book is written in a very childish format and gives you the bare bones minimum mecessary to start a farm. But considering that this was written by a part of the United Nations for all to understand, the large print and small paragraphs have catered to that very well. For those interested in farming indoors, there are no directions given as to how to do it. In all, I feel that the book was entirely inadequate, even for the beginner because the text is very very general and solid information is difficult if not impossible to find."
2,TOO DIM,I was surprised by what I got. This Flashlight is NOT BRIGHT at all. Especially when used as a lantern. I could hardly see the other side of my living room.
4,"Nice flashlight, ok lantern.","I was surprised by how bright this LED flashlight is when used as a flashlight. They've got a nice mirror/lens for focusing the beam. When you pull it apart to make the lantern, it's ok - would probably light up a tent just fine. Would be a nice little light to take camping."
2,Mis-leading ad copy on sales info,There is not 100 different templates. There are about 12 templates with 10 or more color layouts for each template. That is very mis-leading info for this item. Also the templates are very basic you see these designs all the time NOTHING NEW.
5,"The complex made simple - to read, at least!","I enjoy the use of personal journey at the beginning of the book. The author's frustrations pan out to have real answers that are cleanly defined with the clarity only hindsight and rare perception can capture.I am finding the book tremendously useful, neither simplisticly nor weighted with academic analysis. Joe regular-Person will enjoy it. Psychologists and that ilk will benefit by it. Theologians may even have revelations as they read."
5,Taking the Mystery out of Spiritual Growth,"I leave tomorrow to attend the Cloud/Townsend week long intensive for professional counselors. Recommended reading before the conference is, HOW PEOPLE GROW. I feel this was one of the best books I've read on spiritual growth. Leave it to Cloud/Townsend to be theologically accurate, concise, and well articulated. I've deepened my relationship with Jesus through the application of what I've learned through this book. I especially appreciated the insights given about the work of the Holy Spirit as well as their personal illustrations. I'm continually amazed that the authors continue to provide new material in each of their books--a sure sign that they are growing spiritually themselves."
2,So SO,"The item is somewhat impracticle. The leather strap in the middle stretches, and the cover doesn't really protect anything. I suggest getting the nylon cover if you are looking for something to protect your player from dust & dirt."
4,Here comes the sum....,"When I first heard this album - bought on a whim, probably because I like the name - I immediately regretted my decision. It seemed irksome and fey. Somehow I found myself listening to it again some time later and slowly it crept up on me and then it dug its hooks in. It's a lovely summery shimmer (or is that shimmery summer) that's kept this winter vaguely bearable (along with a nice thick pair of pyjamas). The title track is a defiant anthem for leave-me-alone moods and I often find myself tapping my toes and even slapping my thighs to it. A hearty reccommendation from me."
1,Yuck!,This is the worst album I have bought in five years. I bought it on a whim because I had heard Romeo Goes and liked it. This album is so tasteless and lacking in talent of any kind I'm not sure why I even liked the single (which incidentally is 100 times better than the other cuts).
5,THE MOST AMAZING COOKBOOK YOU COULD EVER OWN!,"This is the most amazing cookbook you could ever own. If you only have 1 cookbook, make it this one. My mom got this cookbook as a wedding gift in 1981 and is what we used while I was growing up. I just HAD to find this cookbook when I got married and moved into my own house. I have not made 1 recipe out of this that did not turn out to perfection! (as long as you use Blue Bonnet margarine when it calls for butter or margarine) Again, A MUST FOR EVERYONE who bakes, even if it's only once a year!"
5,Super Time Saver!!!,These are the best liners ever. Best used with boxes that have snap-on lids to hold liner in place because them don't have a drawstring or elastic to hold in place. Also best with cats that are declawed. I have used these liners for at least 3 years and still going strong for my two girls. These are total time savers no having to scrub a dirty box simply remove liner snap box apart rinse off any peep or poop on inside upper lid. These are totally flippin sweet. I give them an A+++++!
5,Perfect,"Fresh Kitty Jumbo Litter Liners / B0002TR21EThese liners are much more thick and sturdy than the other brand I was using. They fit my ""jumbo-sized"" box perfectly, with plenty of room to spare. I don't have any trouble with the liner ripping, tearing, or spilling. However, as a caveat, neither of my two cats have claws and neither is much of a chewer. They leave the litter liners alone, and all I have to worry about is spillage and tearing.~ Ana Mardoll"
4,Health enhancing with a clean refreshing taste!,"This is a classic green tea that brews up to a pale amber liquor with a fine grassy scent. Savor this tea for a delicate and elusive experience. The taste is barley, sweet hay and the faintest herbal taste. The aftertaste is very mild and fresh.Green tea is touted for its health benefits--not just antioxidants but also because it is supposed to help you lose weight!! Green tea averages about 10-30 mg of caffeine as opposed to 90 mg in a cup of coffee. Tazo does not put how much caffeine is in their tea on the box."
5,EXCELLENT HISTORY BOOK,"Extremely well translated by American Egyptologist David Lorton, Hornung's book covers the history of Ancient Egypt from its Archaic to its Late Periods. It provides a concise description of important events through historical facts. A thorough yet brief explanation of political, economical, social, literary and artistical changes of Ancient Egyptian society leads to the development of the kingdoms. Black and white photographs, an excellent bibliography and a glossary explaining commonly used Egyptological terms accompany the main body. Recommended for professionals and amateurs."
2,Political history,"Far from discrediting Professor Hornung's mastery of the subject, I regret to say that this book is only a straightforward and very traditional political history of the successions of dynasties and pharaohs, with occasional hints on developments in art. Being an introductory work, I find it sad that it lacks mention of basic traits of economy and social life in the Egyptian world, as well as a clearer treatment of the state of sources (very common in the most recent general works). Also, the Intermediate Periods are squeezed at the end of the chapters, whose titles end up hinting at a continuity between the Old, Middle and New Kingdoms - the chapter on the Late Period seems even a bit rushed (btw, it accepts uncritically the very old and outdated theory of the ""Sea Peoples"" being a single factor of destruction in 1200BC). The Oxford History of Egypt is much more comprehensive, and I'd recommend it instead of this book."
3,"Mediocre quality, but nice features","I own two of these, which we use for racing applications. It has a lot of features, though they're not very intuitive to use. I don't use the speed function a lot, and every time I do I have to pull out the manual. I never use the alarm, but somehow it set itself and I just haven't bothered (in 6 months) to find the $%*&^ manual to figure out how to turn it off. But those are relative trifles compared to my real beef--the buttons (those we use all the time for lap timing) tend to stick unless you are careful to push STRAIGHT down on them. If they stick, you lose the timing for that lap, and the next one, until you get things back in order. If not for that, these would be great."
3,Eyes Wide Open: An American Christian perspective,"Eyes Wide Open provides a look at the arts of contemporary culture through the eyes of an American Christian. While asserting the need for critical thought on issues of the morality and messages of pop culture's media, Romanowski is not terribly firm on any sort of position either in criticism of the arts or of the Christian culture. This book provides at best an interesting look at the historical aspects of popular culture, but does not provide any real sense of direction in analysis or assesment of the morality of contemporary media."
3,"great album, but the CD won't play in my car","managed to download it to my computer, but i was hoping to have another CD for my car. disappointed about that"
4,Adorable Stitch,"If you love Stitch, this is a must have. Cute, soft and cuddly, this Stitch will put a smile on your face."
3,Catchy Hook,"Every time the title song is played at a club or party,the females for some reason go crazy. Akinyele comes hard and nasty for those that can stand it. ""Put it in your mouth"" was the one track that stood out on the cd. The rest of it was okay. It's more of an EP than a full release album"
3,If you liked Funk Flex's Mixtapes you'll like this.,"Put it in your mouth and F@#k me for free are the hot joints on this album. I would recommend duying it for those two somgs. The other songs are very different. A good variation of style. If you likes ""Loud handover"" on Funk Master Flexs' Mixtape 1 you'll like this!"
1,It's sad that the public wants this,"After finding this on my niece's computer, I had to find out why somebody had to sing such raunchy lyrics. This world is about so much more than men forcing women to do what they want. Now they are singing about it, and calling it music? This is pure trash, and if you like this, then this society is in BIG trouble. Don't put any more money into this man's pocket. I would spend $100 to prevent this from entering a child's ears."
1,Definately NOT Their Best Cases,"I was not real happy with this set. They are so [...] about what they release and withholding all kinds of facts, that these are hardly worth watching. These cases have been thoroughly sanatized and we are only seeing what they want us to see. All the shows in this series are starting to look alike. Ditto Season 3."
4,Jorgensen (2in1)clamps,"I like these clamps alot, they work well one handed. They are ambidextrous and hold well. I don't know the load limit,but i'm sure I have held several hundered pounds with it safely. I would give them 5 of 5 but they pinched the web between my thumb and four finger releasing the presure once."
4,Everyone Will Laugh!!!!,"i ordered this and it came really fast. this is the best to make everyone laugh...i play it picking people up, droping people off, passing bus stops, at intersections, at cops, at mexicans, when it quiet, at ackward moments, passing busses, everywhere! it plays the two mexican songs sepertly on a keychain device.....the only down side is its not as loud as i would like it to be, but dont get it wrong, its loud enough to do the trick! Great item."
1,Bane of my existance,Hole drilled in the wrong place. Pegs on draweres too big. Stripped hole. Glides on desk require additional support for drawer to close properly. Poor quality paint - chips easily. After about 5+ hours of work and a trip to a hardware store I'm still attempting to complete it. I do not recommend this desk.
4,Pop with a punk edge. Lots of different tunes.,"Thats 4 with a +. I'm a big Buzzcocks fan, and while only a few of the songs sound like something the b'cocks might do, they all have that off-beatness and tuneful, carefree sound we know and love. I will be buying more Interpreters albums."
3,Not as good as I hoped it would be.,"This is not a bad recording. I just wouldn't call it a great one. I think the main problems I have with it come from the quality of the sound and backup arrangements. The sound is somewhat dated; the balance between singer and orchestra leaves much to be desired. The backup arrangements seem uninspired compared to those given to a Sinatra recording. While Ms. Bergen has a fine voice, she seems, at that particular point in her career, emotionally disconnected from her material."
5,"defining the term ""torch singer""","Polly Bergen beautifully recreates the definitive torch singer - from the 20s through the 50s. From Why Was I Born done by Helen Morgan in the 1920s to You'll Never Know made famous by Alice Faye in the 1940s to The Party's Over from The Bells are Ringing - a terrific musical comedy of the 1950s. Yes, one of the best bargains around. Polly Bergen is an original, unforgettable artist - she creates the classic ""emotional word picture"" - longing for true love."
1,Great Cartoon - Lousy Recording,This cartoon was recorded in ep mode and is so badly done that you can hardly watch it. It is such a shame that the people who made this tape are so cheap that they couldn't have used a better viewing mode.
2,I used to love this show but I don't anymore,"I saw this show once and it used to be a favorite of mine but not anymore. The animation is awful. It looked like someone was drunk when they made the show. The characters are too poorly drawn and look like a drunk person drew them while getting over a hang over. If you want great classic animation from Nickelodeon, stick with Rugrats, Rocko's Modern Life, Hey Arnold, and The Angry Beavers instead."
2,Warmen--Accept the Fact,"I must say, this is the most inferior Warmen album so far. I agree with the previous reviewer that this album is not even remotely comparable to the two earlier albums in terms of composition, quality, musicianship, or production. As if the band came together one day and put some tracks together just to realease an album. It is certainly a disappointing piece of work for fans of Warmen accustomed to the calibre of Beyond Abilities and Unknown Soldier...we expect much more from you Janne..."
1,Did Not Like,"Considering just how much I enjoy her ""Frankenstein"", this work was a serious letdown. Another one I did not bother to finish."
1,I volunteer for the plague!,"If it is a choice between plague and re-reading this book. The premise of course is stated in the title, which takes some of the suspense out of it and adds endless depths of melodrama. You know that every character you may grow attached to will die except the narrator. However, this isn't too much of a problem because it's very difficult to grow attached to these characters who are often the producers of their own melodramas. And the prose is overblown enough to where I've actually read passages to friends for a laugh. Not recommended except for die hard Shelley and apocalypse fans."
2,Disappointed read [for me],"Sorry but I found this book boring, and uninteresting, and I was so looking forward to reading it.On consideration I think it was mainly the style which put me off, I caught myself skipping passages to find something I could relate too. As I read books from this era I am used to the style and wordiness of them, but this just went on and on, [well it did for me]Never say No to a read, so have a go, and let us know who you found it.Peta KAustralia"
5,My Review,"I was very satisfied not only with the story, but with the quality of the text itself. It stayed very true to the more archaic spellings and grammar in the original, which is something that's really hard to find anymore. In all, it's free, and you should definitely get it."
4,A tale of loneliness,"This may be Mary Shelley's forgotten treasure. The first post-apocolyptic novel, her victorian style is not suited to the dis topic reality she conjures. Mostly you feel the emotions of isolation, loneliness and powerlessness, an emotional backdrop that stemmed from the loss of both her child and beloved husband in real life.This novel has the classical use of the modern English language with the romantic values of its age, yet with vision employed within the post-modern themes of existence, humanity and moral critique all within the expanse of human extinction. A paradoxical universe that see's not only the clash within personality within the human drama, but stylistically between the romanticist and the rationalist literature. It is compelling, and in a way timeless, for the genre it presaged. I recommend"
3,too elaborate,"a bit oldfashioned and not always plausible, as I said too elaborate characters not real figures not as good as Frankenstein"
1,Poor results on the debut album,"DJ Rupture can be a Turntablist, but catchy hooks and consistent melodies is not his strenght. There is no linearity on his first effort, nor good ryddim'. The year this CD was released I saw many ads for this CD, the front CD recalled my attention and I though ""um, ok, good design and the label (Tigerbeat) is known, so...I will get it!""...oh...I shouldn't have. DJ Rupture sound between reggae and hiphop, sometimes it even sound like a poor imitation of PRODIGY...anyway, to be honest this CD is a bit boring, is not my kind of music perhaps?, on either case but I just can't understand it. I am sorry but I am going to the used CD store to trade for something else."
2,good try but...,"This was a good try to make an acleptic disc, but... The result wasn't as nice as it could be. Song's are bored. They don't get you lintenig to them more than 30 seconds. The styles covered on the disc are very wide ranging from noise to latin hip-hop. Hard to fit all of them on the same disc! this is acheved in a good way... The problem is that all the songs are at the same level, and it's not too much high.Listen just as an example of what can be done combining styles on he same production. Not as a reference for anything. In one Word: Borred. Just turn around and look for something else. The money is not rewarded with this cd."
5,Great Clamps!,I bought these 10 years ago and went to Home Depot to get the pipes. These are excellent clamps and I have used to for many projects that require long clamps. Highly recommend them.
4,These are GREAT clamps - if you're out of Bessy Revo's,"These clamps appeal to many woodworkers, and they certainly have their place in any woodshop. However, they are not perfect.One problem is that they have a tendency to pull frames out of square, and or put a bow in your glue ups if you're not careful - which is really not a problem of the clamp itself, but the flexing of the pipe. Do not buy these clamps in the 1/2"" variety for any length over 4 feet.I own and use these clamps and I wouldn't be without them. But, if I can get a Bessey on my projects (up to 80"") then that's the clamp I reach for."
4,A MUST HAVE,There isn't much to these clamps and thats what makes them so darn useful.It seems like the race is on to see who can build a better clamp. Perhaps pipe clamps are like the mouse trap so called improvements have been made. But are they really better? granted there are some nice clamps out there but dont overlook the simplicity of the jorgenson.It's tried true and timeless not to mention very inexpensive.I choose to use galvenized pipe instead of black it tends to be cheaper and wont rust up and stain your project.Now get out there and clamp something.
5,Godzilla of the Clamp World,"If you find yourself facing a job that requires maximum clamping power, a few (or allot) of these are what you need. I was faced with this when laminating a 36"" x 120"" worktop consisting of 2x4's. These clamps had the guts to pull the worst out of my warped boards.The crank style handle worked very smooth and has adequate travel. The adjustment with the handle was such that either light or heavy pressure could be applied with ease. The clamps can also be set horizontally on a flat surface allowing you to edge glue pieces for tabletops very easily. The beauty of this style clamp is the ability to change clamping length needs quickly. One clamp with multiple lengths of threaded steel "" pipe gives you endless capabilities.While the steel bar type clamps do have their niche for lighter task (drawer construction, carcasses assembly, etc), these clamps can handle your most demanding job.You just can't have enough of'em!"
3,Go for cheaper versions,"While these clamps are very nice, they are really expensive. If you are looking for pipe clamps like this, you can definitely find them cheaper. They are very handy though.PROS** Ease of use** You determine length of clamp by the length of pipe.** Undoubtedly, a lifetime tool.CONS** Expensive** Longer clamps tend to get awkward due to the weight.** Round pipe can't be held as securely as square pipe."
4,Very Good,This movie came to me in good shape (for a VHS) and it plays well. I had not seen this movie in years. Thank you
2,Seems like a bargain but isn't...,"For precision tools like spokeshaves and planes, detail and quality in manufacturing is immediately apparent in the usefulness of the tool. These bargain set seems to be marketed to the beginner or to perhaps intermediate or ""branching out"" woodworkers who'd like to try hand tools over power tools. I experienced quite a bit of chatter from the spokeshave when working with ash. No amount of adjustment seemed to help."
2,"Smoothing plane is ok, block plane and shave are useless","After some quite some tuning, I did manage to get the smoothing plane to cut some nice thin shaving.I can't get anything out of the block plane nor the shave.I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Smooth jazz,"Not bad, but nearly enough piano for my taste, and way too much smooth jazz saxophone on some of the tracks. I wasn't familiar with her music before purchasing this CD, other than a snippet I heard on the radio, much edgier than anything here. I was hoping this live CD would be, well, a little livelier than it turned out to be. Unless you're a smooth jazz enthusiast and want something to compliment your Kenny G collection, keep looking."
5,A very special touch for the piano!!!!,"Keiko Matsui es una de las estrellas femeninas orientales que cuando uno las escucha resultan una màs que agradable sorpresa....piense por ejemplo en el violìn màgico de Vannesa Mae. Este CD es para oirlo relajado degustando un buen HUPPMAN SELECTO o MONTECRISTO 2 SELECCION ESPECIAL (cubanos, por supuesto,) y una buena copa de Brandy 1866.....para que se de un buen Bonefire in the piano.......Keiko Matsui is one of the new femenine east stars that are making spectacular performances.....think about the magical violin of Vannesa Mae. This CD es for very special relax moments.., smoking a HUPPMAN SELECTO or MONTECRISTO 2, SPECIAL SELECTION (cubans, of course) and a good cup of spanish Brandy 1866.....you got the special spell for a Bonfire in the piano...."
5,The souls of the Civil War dead will haunt you.,"The gun-smoke souls of the dead from the Civil War spirit on in the empathetic penning of poet Joseph Gustafson. In Gettysburg Voices: Civil War Poems, Gustafson brings stinging emotions and thoughts into the reader who in turn is afforded spiritual haunt, the Whitmanesque, soft and hard pain, message, and love for language in expressing poetic reaction to the actions of man in time.- Michael Hood"
3,my bed,"I'm 5'11 and 150lbs. I prefer a firm mattress and this one is a bit on the soft side. I feel a little bit like Uncle Fester from the Adams family when i lie down, as i sink in and the edges wrap around me (exaggeration). this problem is compounded if you have someone joining you. me and my girlfriend would find ourselves sinking in towards one another if we slept too closely together.this is an awesome mattress don't get me wrong but I would enjoy it more if it were firmer. my buddy bought the one that wasn't therapeutic and found that his is firm and to his liking. keep in mind that sleeping on a wood floor doesn't strike me as being entirely uncomfortable. also if its the summer you will find a bit of sweat underneath you."
5,Great mattress,"Memory foam type mattresses are the only mattress I can sleep on (I have fibromyalgia). This mattress is great - sleeps as well as the higher priced brands, but cost about half as much. It came in a sort of shrink wrap. All you do is take the wrapping off and withing 2 hrs the mattress expands to its normal size and is ready to sleep on. It also had very little odor that is typical with memory foam. Love this mattress - would buy it again and definitely recommend it to friends and family."
4,Exceptional bed!,"I bought this bed after sleeping on a cheap futon for about 6 months. I received it 2 days after I ordered it with no problems. I find this bed to be extremely comfortable and it baffles me how other memory foam mattresses can be double the price of this one or more. I read complaints about a smell the bed gives off, I noticed the smell on the second day I had it and never again after that. The only recommendation I would make about this bed is if you are a side sleeper buy the model up from this that has the less dense foam layer. I lay on my back, sides, and stomach, and when I end up on my side for an extended period it could use a little more cushion. overall though I am very pleased with what I bought and consider it money well spent and it is leaps and bounds more comfortable than a futon."
1,Not like tempur-pedic !,"I had tested the tempur-pedic mattress before buying this one, and it's not the same. This has been the worst ""mattress"" I have ever slept on. My back hurts worse than ever, and I havent had a good nights sleep since I bought the thing. I do not recomend this for people who want a quality mattress. This feels more like a bad futon."
3,Customer service issues,"After hearing so much about the bed, I was a little disappointed not to have better treatment from the tempur-pedic corporate customer support staff. We had an issue and were told to simply live with it. Obviously it works well for most people - have to be a few people that have a bad experience now and then. Hopefully you are one of the lucky ones."
1,Don't count on it,"I was nervous about purchasing this item due to the Sleep Shop's inconsistent delivery problems. The mattress was not delivered to me on time in spite of the fact that I contacted them prior to delivery to make sure everything was in order. There is no tracking and their delivery estimates are way off. If you need a mattress to be delivered on time, look elsewhere."
2,long stink,"Delivery was quick. Mattress is not as soft as I had hoped but I sleep well every night. Except for the smell. I aired it out for several days and now after having it for almost a month I'm still pulling the cover and sheets off and opening my windows during the day - looking forward to the night I don't smell the off-gasing or whatever anymore. And needless to say, good luck ever returning it without the machine they used to roll it up in the factory. But overall it's a nice bed- or will be when it stops stinking"
2,Mattress sagging,"I bought this mattress in Feb 2011 and within six months, it began to sag and go soft. Initially, it was great. But there is a waffle/convoluted layer between the hard foundation foam and memory foam on top. It is not a solid piece. I've slept on a variety of mattresses, including tempur-pedic, comfortaire and latex. My advice: go straight to Tempur-pedic. This foam will not hold up over time and your money will be wasted. You can only return this if you can photograph a 1.5"" impression in the mattress."
5,I like foam,The bed is super comfortable (especially with my new soft sheets). It almost feels like melting into it. Delivery was fast. The only thing I sorta disliked was carrying it up the stairs. It comes vacuum sealed and rolled so it is basically an 80 lb 2ft diameter 5ft long cylinder with no real handholds. Also the slight scent that exists from the vacuuming process was noticable but not overpowering.
1,Who needs fingernails and a chalkboard any more?,"Took the gamble on this one after reading about Elisabeth Esselink's Solex gig. And, how could you not get at least entertainment value off each tune having ""Solex"" somewhere in the title. Kaz and I tried to catch the Detroit show at the Gold Dollar, but she bailed due to sickness or something. Too bad because perhaps it could have saved me a couple of bucks. ""One Louder Solex"" and ""Solex all Licketysplit"" are good tunes, but it'd be a stretch to even say this is an acquired taste. Give Solex an A+ for entertainment value but unless you don't tire of listening to fingernails scraping against a chalkboard, listen before you buy."
1,A waste,"If you have ever read a dating book in your life, don't waste your time or money with this. It has absolutely nothing new, and is based entirely on common sense. Unless you think successful dating is about looking your worst and sleeping with every man you meet, this book won't teach you anything you don't already know."
4,Good product,"I thought it explained difficult concepts clearly. As for the software, I installed it on my Windows XP PC, and it did not work properly until I downloaded a patch from the internet. After that, it worked fine. Downloading and installing the patch was not difficult, because when the program launches it asks you if you want to check for updates. If you click yes, it finds and installs the patch. Still, here's hoping that the patch is included in the next version."
1,Total garbage cobbled from leftover wood chips!!!,"This program has not changed a bit since the 2001 version. It was buggy then, it is still buggy, and just like years ago...there is really no support or updates for this. Basically, this company just keeps repackaging the same old junk in a different wrapper!!!!!It is rudimentary and perfect for the 4th to 8th grader...IF YOU CAN GET IT TO WORK!!!!!!Yes, the other reviews are correct! My friend gave this to me after buying it and going crazy trying to make it run reliably.Get MATH ADVANTAGE 2007 instead. It is not terrific, but it is homogeneous, reliable and it does the job!! Also, consider some of the better video/PC tutorials you can find at Home Schooling websites and suppliers. They have excellent programs that cannot be found any where else!"
1,Can't get through a full lesson.,This thing freezes up like crazy. I tried it on three different computers and encountered the same problem on all of them. The patches did'nt either. Wish I could get my money back.
4,Great teacher,"This is a great software program for supplementing math education. It broke down the steps and made it easier to understand for my child.Also as noted, I was getting frustrated with the constant freezing and she was not able to finish the lessons. The reason I found this site was because I decided to look up and find what the problem could be and if anyone else had the problem. I see many have. I did what was suggested and I downloaded the patch until I got the message that said I have the latest version. It took 3 or 4 times but works great afterwards."
2,did not help,I bought this program as a supplimental math program for my 14 year-old daughter. I was hoping that it could help her in geometry. I have a fairly new computer but still experienced some freezing with this program. This ended up not being the help that I wanted for her and we are currently not using it.
2,Reservations!,"Not particularly pleased with ""Math Success Deluxe 2007"".Problems experienced during game play in the animated classroom environment, causing unexpected computer freeze. Overall, a horribleSoftware program with many software issues to resolve."
1,Not So Good Learning,Am going to collage very soon and thought a math disk would help me greatly. The Math Success Deluxe 2007 looked promising even though my sister got there 2006 verison and it froze on her many times I asummed that 2007 would be differant. It looked great and very differant so I downloaded it and it worked for a little then froze on me and I have a very new PC its only a month old!!So my warning is do not buy this I wish there was a review like this before I wasted money on this. I know this game would be great if it worked.
3,"A soft, verbal, comfy chair for boomers","Yep; this book will make most boomers, especially the ones who grew up in the 60s, feel right at home.Boomer author Debbie Holland writes about what she knows... growing up a boomer and being a boomer adult. From pecan pies to super-size fries; from Jethro Bodine to Jerry Seinfeld... Debbie does boomers! Her book helps explain who and what we are.""The Boomers' Next Frontier"" is not an earth-shaking, ground-breaking analysis of the boomer generation. It is not a comprehensive look at why we are what we are. There is no heavy analysis, and no deep soul-searching between the covers of this book. It is just a short (103 pages), pleasant look at who we were... and who we have become. It is a nice, comfortable read for a rainy day."
3,One Size Fits All,"Perhaps size is a word that shouldn't be used in a Gay book review, but much of what's here is common sense."
4,Very good series,I like this series very much and is so hard find the other seasons.Better then beavis and butthead
5,Premise Is Correct,"The book's title says it all and then some. After reading this book, I have little doubt left in my mind that a salad made with cucumbers is far superior to one made with men; with the possible exception of a Waldorf, some varieties of Caesar which exclude anchovies, and a rare salad from the island nation of Tonga, known only as the cocoa bong bong. Furthermore, it is shown that men fall short of the cucumber in the categories of greenness and bicycle racing. A monumental read, comparable to The Bobsey Twins Attend Their Senior Prom. You won't feel en-""cumbered"" when you strum your ""cuke""-alele in celebration, after chewing and savoring the life-lessons of this succulent salad-patch potboiler!"
2,A high price to pay for just four pieces of rubber!,"There will be occasions when these clamp pads are useful, when their limited surface and rubber construction make them ideal.Yet, there will be times when they slip off, don't spread the pressure enough or just can't be found.The pony clam is a delightful clamp to use, but I'd rather just find a piece of scrap wood that is just the right size or spans two or more clamps.Save yourself the five dollars. After all it's a high price to pay for just four pieces of rubber!"
4,Clamp pads do not just fit Jorgensen clamps!,I bought these pads for some old pipe clamps that were not Jorgensen clamps just to see if they would work. To my surprise they worked on all the pipe clamps in my shop (24 different size and types). A lot of the home improvement and hardware stores within 50 miles of my shop (in Kentucky) do NOT stock these pads. The price was fair and these pads do a great job protecting the wood surfaces. I highly reccommend them to any one using pipe clamps!
4,More plastic than rubber,They help to not mark up the wood and fit nicely. Only have slipped off a few times probably due to my mistake.
5,A must for pipe clamping,"Some might disagree on whether or not you need a pad for pipe clamps. I'm sure we can all agree that pipe clamps are capable of putting down some serious pressure. Even on hardwoods you are going to get a divot in the edge of your workpiece if you clamp too hard. These rubber pads help greatly in reducing that. A lot of times it doesn't really matter because you make your piece over size and trim it down later anyway. However, I feel a lot better having good edges to my work in case of a drop or damage to part of the piece that needs to be cut off. Might have to pick up another set of these, but already got 2 packs so I should be set for a while.Oh, and just in case. These do fit 3/4"" pipe clamps. I have the Pony clamps and they slide on tightly so they should stay put."
4,Very comprehensive,"This book enlists many different authors, who all have an amazing point of view on the built environment. From gated communities to Disneyland, every chapter expresses concerns of fast-changing developed environments. Our cities are quickly becoming cold, enclosed enclaves. This book helped me realize how our society has snubbed the utilizaton of public space. This is definitely a book for every person interested in city planning, urban studies,or sociology. Whether a student or leisure reader, this book will open your minds to what is really taking place in our cities, suburbs, resorts, and recreational facilities. Any place in which society is forced to interact with one another is referred to in ""Variations on a Theme Park"". Read it. It will open your mind!"
3,"Interesting, but Outdated","This book consists of various essays on the built environment, basically arguing in essay form (which means lots of words) that we should go back to more original forms of the city instead of the faux reality we have today. The book is interesting, but it is also glaringly out of date. A lot has changed in the world in the past 20 years. While the book gives you a good general overview of the topics at hand with the examples used, I would be interested in seeing an essay about any of the multitude modern additions to the built environment."
5,A Real Eye Rescue,This kit has saved me many evenings of eye strain. I am a dollhouse and miniature enthusiast who works and makes items that in the scale of 1 foot equals 1 inch. Working with items that are that small in size eye strain is a sure thing. The Eye Rescue kit has reduced my severe headaches and visual stess due to eye strain. The supplements in the kit improve eye circulation and the vision exercises included on audio tape have been a real eye rescue.
5,Refreshing Look at Lesbian Love,"Whether you're new to the scene, a veteran, or just interested in a peek at the ""other side"", Bar Girls is a great lesbian movie. The story flows, the characters reflect reality, and the dialogue is downright funny! After renting from my local lesbian bookstore 3 times, I finally ordered my own copy."
3,Better as a Stage Play?,This film has the hottest seduction scene in 90s lesbian film and it's marginally better than Claire of the Moon.
1,Worst Lesbian Film Ever!,Like most lesbians...whenever a film is produced that may end up having a lesbian storyline...I'm one of the first ones in line to see it.Not only was I disappointed in Bar Girls...I was imbarrassed to tell anyone I'd seen it at all (at the theatre no less!).The Title says it all: Bar Girls. You'll see a better drama/comedy hanging out at your own local lesbian bar (if your town has one...).
2,Bar Girls,"I hate to say it, but I've been suckered a few times into buying Lesbian ""R-rated"" films. These flicks are sadly lacking in the nudity department, let alone the sexual arena. I guess if you were a Lesbian and just wanted to see Lesbians communicate, well then, maybe these flicks might just be for you. I refuse to by another ""R-rated"" movie. The ""R"" just tells me that the makers of these films were more concerned about Box Office receipts than actually making a provocative movie. From now on it's NC-17 baby. Lets hope more are produced in the future. ""Lust,Caution"" [NC-17] by the way, was an excellent film!"
1,If I could give it negative stars I would,"I think there must be two movies called Bar Girls, cause I certainly didn't see the same movie as the rest of the reviewers. This was the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot went slower than a slug on valium. Watching it was so painful it made me want to bang my head against a wall till I passed out. The characters were uninteresting and definitely unrealistic. Butch women tend to look butch, not like femmes with slightly less make up. The acting was terrible, the directing was terrible, and the screenplay must have been written by a drugged mime. If you want to know what lesbian culture is really like, watch anything but this movie."
2,Don't waste your time.,"This is all about lesbian drama - the incestuous intermingling of exes and friends, the occasional troglodyte who is attracted to people in couples and causes lots of break ups... it was amusing and fairly uninteresting because it so closely resembles the boring drama I have seen among many friends.... yawn."
3,Bar Girls...A Quickie Movie with a Purpose,"Bar Girls is a movie intended to deploy the insecurity and fear of people, especially the characters involved...Obviously it could have had a better soundtrack, more focused acting crew, but overall the point is clearly stated...One star for attempting some sort of originality, one for the humor and one because I am a nice critic...Three out of five stars!"
2,Bar Girls,Although I would have to agree that Bar Girls was far from one of the best movies I've ever seen. I would have to say that it was at least better than Go Fish. You couldn't pay me to watch that one again.
1,avoid it!,"I was terribly disappointed by this film. The sound, screenplay, acting and direction are all terrible. Everything about it just screams low budget. It has the quality of a home video created in someone's basement. This is a film to avoid!"
1,Not that great,"I was disappointed. After reading positive reviews I felt the storyline was dumb, the acting poor and the relationships unbelievable. Rent before you buy."
3,What I want to know is...,"what happened to the gorgeous, husky-voiced, luscious, deliciously dykey Camila Griggs who plays the agressive cop J.R. Now, she is hot. My ""ultimate dream girl"" fantasy to quote her character in the movie.You could cast her as the Xena uber in any of those fan inspired novels with no leap of imagination whatsoever. Someone should've starred her in her own lesbian indie. The woman has got to have a following. It was great to see a strong, totally believable (and very attractive) amazon gay woman portrayed for a change."
1,Don't buy these mats...they are one size fits all!,"Don't buy floor mats from Weathertech! Despite the fact that thy have you enter your vehicle make, model and year it's all a sham. The mats they ship you are ""one size fits all"" and they encourage you to cut them to fit your vehicle. That might work if they were too big but the mats I recently ordered for my Honda Pilot were too small and looked like a postage stamp sitting in a sea of carpet. When I called Weathertech and finally got through(their customer service wait times are horrible...no doubt from people like me returning their products)they said I could return the mats, but that I would have to pay the return shipping which turned out to be $25.00. Save your money and work with a reputable company that actually delivers what they promise. I'd rate them lower than one star...but the system won't let me go that low!"
1,They do not fit,"Despite the information given by WeatherTech on their website. These mats are notably too large for a 2010 Murano. Trimming them would not have solved the problem that the matching rear mats are much too small!Even more damning, when I attempted to return them directly to the manufacturer in Bollingbrook, IL, they wouldn't work with me and refused to accept them."
3,"Not an exact fit, but good enough","I have a 2005 Murano. Nissan no longer makes mats for that year but they told me the ones they have would fit. They didn't. The Nissan ones are slightly shorter (front to back) and the holes where the driver side mat clips into the floor in front of the seat don't line up. These mats have the same issue, but they are very good quality and less expensive than buying from the dealer. They do slide around slightly, especially when I'm wearing bulkier snow boots, but they are rigid enough not to curl up and interfere with the peddles.I'm satisfied with them, they are close enough and great quality for the price."
5,Excellent Fit,Excellent fit. An ideal set to use since there are no similar OEM mats available. Now looking for rear seat set.
5,Jorgensen 2-in-1 Clamps,"I think these are the best ""one-hand"" clamps going because they have the most springiness. All the others are too stiff and do not allow you to easily adjust the clamping pressure. I have purchased many different types and this is the one I will continue to buy."
3,not such a bargain.,these little guys are great - however the web page shows a retail price of 33.86 - the same item in the catalog is only 23.99. You do the math - an offer of 21.94 just isn't that great over 23.99. Truth in advertising?
1,Not what is shown,"The item sent is not the picture that is shown. It is a much cheaper looking Kinetic Classicor. I ordered this one for its style, but it is not what was received."
3,Volume to low,"could have been louder dosent do as much harm as it couldWolo Model 003 Music Time Remote Controlled Speaker Plays Two Tunes, Dixie and On The Road Again - 12 Volt"
1,Seller shipped ENGLISH version!!!,"After paying almost $50 for a japanese text version of this book for a baby shower gift, I was very excited to see the package arrive. When i opened it I was fuming!!! The seller shipped me the english version of the book! Which by the way had a price tag on it for $2.99! Wow! I attempted to contact the seller to resolve the issue but the only response was ""ship the book back to me and i will issue a refund once i receive it"" um... NO! i was not going to pay $$$ out of my pocket for their mistake! After several emails to the seller with no response what so ever...It ended up I had to file a claim via Amazon to get a refund."
1,Do not buy this.,This product was not satisfactory for my use. The color is very light almost transparent and pink rather than red. The printing is not readable.
2,Not what I expected.,The product photo on Amazon shows a flip top lid. I wanted a flip top lid spice jar. What I received is a flat rotating lid. The size is great however it is not a flip top lid. If there is more that one type of lid then the photo should show both and the customer should have the option of which one they want.Not so happy with getting something other than what was in the picture.
5,Great product - easy to make and tasty,"We love this chili mix. We used to buy it in MI, but cannot find it any more. We were happy to be able to purchase it through Amazon. We serve different kinds of chili at an annual party we have and the Cinicannit style one is a big hit. I almost hate to admit to friends how easy to make. The vendor also delivers quickly."
4,Cincinatti Style Chili Mix,It's a great flavor for this style of chili. I use it exclusively and it is an often-asked-for meal item.
5,Cincinnati Chili is awesome!,"If you love visiting the Cincinnati, Ohio (& N.Kentucky) area then you must have tried either Skyline or Gold Star Cincinnati chili. If you have or have not then please try this product either way. Cincinnati chili is wonderfully different and this mix cooks up to taste exactly like what you get in Cincinnati! No fooling, it's great!"
5,Skyline Lover?,"If you've left Cincinnati and can't get your Skyline Chili fix, here's the next best thing! Really easy and tastes very close to Skyline."
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!",Cincinnati chili is the best and this mix is so easy and delicious! I would definitely buy again and I wholeheartedly recommend it.
5,Buy this book!,"I just can't understand why this book isn't available in as many bindings/formats/editions as the Christian Bible. This book is as-or-more important. Maybe it should be a part of the Canon; perhaps, it should immediately follow the Book of Revelation. This is what we can expect in 2012. Be prepared! The Kaiju are coming!"
4,The TV Clown,"Cepillin is a mexican clown who reached fame in the 70's. He was a very trendy ADIDAS style kid entertainer. The songs are very groovy, the music is a fascinating trip through weird funky stuff. Every (EVERY) mexican kid born in the 70's grew up with this hipster. I gave 4 stars because there are a lot of missing songs. For example: Amor Chiquito, Pancho Lopez, En un Bosque de la China, Gallinita Co Co Ua. BUT includes great non hits like La pelota vieja (Bizzarre, highly recomended). It contains a lot of classic sing-a-longs like Acitron de un Fandango, Yo Tenía Diez Perritos, Doña Blanca and Mambru."
3,alarming concepts,It is almost unbelievable just how much ignorance and hatred can pervade the hearts and minds of such a previously great culture.
3,2 Sided Views,"I read a lot of Muslim apologists writing that Ibn Waraqq's book is ""one-sided."" Could they recommend any books that are 2-sided? One part of book is critical of Koran and/or Islam and other parts of book are full of compliments. Any titles to recommend?Also, when someone uses the term ""dated"" to denigrate someone's scholarship, would they also consider the Koran, a 1,400 yr. old text, dated?"
3,Interesting,"Book can be divided into three sections, first section about the paralells between the Abrahamic religions to prove that Prophet got his ideas from Judaism and Christianity and therefore not an original but a copy cat. We all know that Islam accepts Christianity and judaism as legitimate religions to have same stories dd not suprise me. Second part about certain statements that commentators disagreed about their meanings and authors provide their own interpretation adding to pool some more. Nothing is new all commentators agrees that there are certain things that are interpreted differently. The last section is sections from Bell's Intrioduction to Kur'an. Book has a very good list of sources, of course each of them has their own biases. I find the book interesting to be able to have collection of so many essays, studies under one roof although they all seem to have same bias.It is a book that is good for counterbalancing the other extereme."
1,Not at all scholarly,"Herbert Berg has labelled him as polemical and inconsistent in his writing.[5] Fred Donner, a professor in Near Eastern studies, notes Ibn Warraq's lack of specialist training in Arabic studies, citing ""inconsistent handling of Arabic materials,"" and unoriginal arguments. Donner also criticizes Ibn Warraq for what he describes as ""heavy-handed favoritism"" and ""the compiler's [Ibn Warraq] agenda, which is not scholarship, but anti-Islamic polemic."" -WikipediaThis book is not at all interesting. It uses recycled material from other polemics. Not only that, his arguments have a weak base and are simply not at all scholarly. Taking a look at this other books, its no secret that Ibn Warraq is not in search of anything other than having people come to his side.Since ibn warraq has an ""inconsistent handling of Arabic materials,"" how can we accept this book as sound, seeing how the Quran is in Arabic?"
1,weakly constructed arguments,"I am not impressed... I was looking for something that was comprehensive in its argument and found this to be rather malicious and agenda-driven. If his arguments are indeed true in regards to Islam, intolerance, and jihad, then historically we must have lived in another world because applying these principles, as stated by the author, by the Muslims when they ruled the civilized world for 100s of years would have resulted in a much different world, not one where the European enlightenment got its spark and source of knowledge from."
5,A fun little movie.,"Yoga and the Kung Fu GirlA great little movie. OK it is dine on a shoe string budget, yet the acrobatics showing yoga kung fu from India is something very unique.It's a rare chance to see an asian movie that wasn't going to be released, fortuitously it was.Just sit back, relax and enjoy the expertise where no stuntmen are involved.Sometimes we have to use suspended belief or just accept that the quality 30 years ago is not state of the art.Anyhow, it can be viewed on youtube."
4,A trip into another world,"This is the first in the series of Sister Fidelma mysteries that I read, and it won't be the last. Set in Ireland in the year 665(!), this story involves not only a number of murders but also a surprisingly detailed glimpse into the legal and political systems of that era. I understand Tremayne is a respected authority on ancient Celtic culture, and his background shows. The plot is complicated and the language strange (how should I pronounce words like ""dalaigh"" and names like ""Mhichil""?), but it is a satisfying mystery with a carefully crafted plot that takes no shortcuts and doesn't leave the reader feeling cheated at the end. Read this if you're interested in experiencing the flavor of a different era (which yet has some strange resemblances to our own) and willing to pay close attention!"
3,Not one of the best in the series,"While all of the books in Tremayne's Sister Fidelma series are engaging, the earlier works, such as this one, are less developed in terms of Fidelma's psychological profile. Beyond her general chutzpah and quiet love for Brother Eadulf, we don't get the same insight that is revealed in later works such asAct of Mercy (Sister Fidelma Mysteries).While Tremayne's historical knowledge is to be applauded, the application to the mystery makes the reading a bit arduous. Sometimes the historical lessons are a bit heavy-handed, and I found myself resenting the fact that the mystery's solution was dependent upon a working knowledge of 7th century Old Irish.That said, this book, like the others in the series, is a solidly fun mystery and an enjoyable read."
4,A Wonderful Mystery!,"These Sister Fidelma mysteries are wonderfully crafted. It may be a bit difficult to read and pronounce some of the ancient Irish names and places, but don't let that hang you up. ""Suffer Little Children"" author Peter Tremayne weaves an intricate plot and those who enjoy a good ""whodunit"" will take pleasure in the twists and turns of his story of this brilliant nun. The characters are well rounded and he uses vivid imagery to describe the various locations in ancient Ireland. His ""courtroom"" scene at the end the book brings all of the suspects together beautifully, before Sister Fidelma reveals the motives and the murderer. Those who have read Ellis Peters series on Brother Cafael will be thoroughly transported to another historical era of mystery enjoyment."
4,Perfect birthday cake top for 3 year old Cash fan,"My 3 year old grandson loved it and is very excited about having ""Johnny Cash"" figure.Very good image of Johnny Cash and having the removable guitar is fun; my grandson pretended to play guitar. Made a cake 'stage' for figure to stand on. He is now enjoying looking at it in a china cabinet."
1,What a sham,"First of all the ""advertisment"" of this figure looks great however the actual figure looks nothing like johnny cash. I have many figures and this has got to be one of the worst cases of false advertising I have ever seen. What a rip"
1,Not as authentic as expected.,"Simple recipes, yes. Although there's ketchup (?!) in the pad thai recipe. 'Nuff said."
5,Fast & Easy Thai food,"We have had this cook book for 20 years. It is the most used cook book we have. The recipes are fast, easy and delicious. I can't recommend it enough!"
4,Their best album.,"Although I'd rate all of their albums worth owning, this one hits that neglected area in the back of your brain most often. For the first time on Basshole vinyl (or plastic, depending on your preference), you get not only the lo-fi rock splatters that characterize their other records but also more experimental records like the genuinely haunting ""Joan Dark"" and the spooky title track. This'll make you slit your wrists in both directions."
5,"Sad, but Beautiful","I just finished reading this book, which I found very entertaining, well-written, and thoroughly researched, with characters that stay with you after the book is returned to the shelf.The aftermath is sad, the more becuase it is true, but the love shared by Richard and Meggotta is one of a kind.I highly recommend it!"
2,Who's the intended audience for this?,"Two affectionate children grow up under the reign of Henry IV.This book never grabbed me. The writing was so simplistic that it felt like it had been written for children, and the children's innocence made an awkward counterbalance to the scheming of the adults. I only got about a quarter of the way through before giving up."
4,Pretty freaking good,"I'm really surprised by the new megadeth. With songs like ""Washington is next!!"" megadeth really seems to go back to their roots. Playing fast sustained melody with intricate transitions really showcases how technically talented these musicians are. Good job Mega!"
4,The Dave Mustaine Band,"This record is pretty good from start to finish. A very tight recording, more like Countdown. This record has a heavy driving sound mixed with cool clean guitar sounds, similar to the great ""So Far, So Good, So What"" record. -An album that is always overlooked by Megadeth fans.What makes this record sound most ""Megadeth'ish"", is the politically driven lyrics within each song. Dave is once again pissed off about the world's conflicts, THANK GOD!One disappointment is the remake of ""A Tout De Monde"" This song and ""Return to Hanger"" on the previous record are just fillers. The originals should be left alone!In my opinion, Megadeth was Marty, Dave, and David. Dave will never be able to replace Marty... Marty added soo much taste and unique qualities that made Megadeth in their glory days.Nevertheless, buy this one for sure."
3,Not sure why I expected better....,"Not a bad album for the fresh listener who never heard the songs Holy Wars or Set The World Afire. But for those of us who remember Marty Friedman era Megadeth...Well I guess this only solidifies the fact that what once was will never be again. On another note, why is everyone complaining about Dave being so political? This is a band who always made music about politics and war. So the writing is not really all that different. But what are you gonna do? With the rest of the mediocre crap out there nowadays...I guess I should be grateful for this release."
3,3.7 stars,"This isn't a bad album at all. Its better than some of the stuff the put out after Rust in Peace. In case you didnt guess, this is a political Megadeth album. The tracks aren't bad though a few are a little tiring this is a good album. Plus people wanna bitch about a newer version of A Tout Le Monde, well im pretty sure Metallica made three different versions of Unforgiven so look in the mirror guys. Anyway, this isnt their best album of all time but its a solid album from Megadeth. I like the apocalyptic refrences in this album. It really adds a feel about how Dave sees the modern day society. Some people say that this album sucks because it is politically charged but part of me finds that part interesting. If you are a fan you already have this album im sure if you dont have this, I urge you to check it out, you might like it."
3,Digital Distortion,"Haven't got much to say about the songwriting etc - most of that has been covered adequately in other reviews. My choice of 3 stars is due to the digital distortion that rears its ugly head through some of the songs on my copy of the album. I have no idea where my copy comes from (not sure if they are manufactured here in New Zealand or are imported as ready made CDs from somewhere else) but the audio quality is lame!! I bought the album on the strength of Andy Sneap's involvement, so I feel certain that the distortion cannot be his fault. Somewhere in the post production process, one person too many has pushed the levels too far. If I was Mustain I would be disappointed in the audio quality of the CD that is available in New Zealand at least.I have ordered another copy and intend to A/B them. I'll write something else about it when that happens.So, the usual top marks to Megadeth for the music, but the audio quality is boyish at best."
3,Mixed Emotions,"I have given this three stars because I love the music, I love the singing and I hate the lyrics. It definitely seems like Dave has an axe to grind with every country except the U.S. I'm really growing weary of all the bands that use their music to express their political and religious views. Dave does both here. I've also had it with the concept albums built around the 911 attacks, Afghanistan and Iraq. I listen to music to escape reality. I wouldn't call Dave's views reality just his personal opinion. If you like Ted Nugent's views you'll probably like this as well. You could have done better Dave and the fans deserved better."
1,Not a good Album,"I'm a big Megadeth fan. I have 7 of their albums and they are all great (well except ""So Far, So Good...So What!""). I expected this would be good as well. I can't get over how bad it really is. It sounds like the lyrics were recorded without listening to the music. The original version of ""A Tout le Monde"" is better than the new version on this album. and sadly that is the best song on the album. On a positive note it is not as bad as the last Metallica Album (St. Anger). This is their worst effort in 20 years worse than ""So Far, So Good...So What!""."
3,Peace Sells - RIP - Countdown,"There are 3 excelent Megadeth albums: ""Pease sell... but who's buying"", ""Rust In Peace"" (The Best), and ""Countdown to Extinction"". This album is ok for a band that is not what it used to be.Anybody who thinks this album is one of the greatest is wrong, Don't know what Mustaine was able to do."
3,"Not their greatest album, but...","Ok, so I analyzed this album and I compare it with ""The World Needs A Hero"". In my opinion, they both have several good songs, but all the other songs are very uninspiring and boring. I tried to get into ""Risk"", but bad reviews proved to be true, complete waste of time... Anyway, we live in a time of incredibly accesible digital music and we are lucky that this website offer good quality mp3's. I'd recommend ""Sleepwalker"", ""You're Dead"" and ""Burnt Ice""."
5,Best Megadeth record since Rust in Peace,"That sums it up in a nutshell...this record sounds like it could have been the logical next release after Rust in Peace. Not quite as good as that classic masterpiece, but close enough. Just listen to ""Washington is Next""!Trust me, this is the Megadeth record we've been waiting over 15 years for!!Phenomenal!"
5,Great album!!!,I have to say this album is much better than Blackmail handsdown.I went into wally world to buy Black Rain when I seen this by chance put my trust & $14.00 in Dave. In my opinion this CD is better than Blackmail lyricly & musicly. Now that I own this and Black Rain I have to say I enjoy this CD more every song is good not just three or four.
3,42 year old Mustaine fan weighs in,"The lastest offering from Megadeth is a bit dissapointing to me. I am an old school Megadeth fan back from Killing is my business days. In my opinion, United Abominations sounds like everything after Youthanaisa (mediocore). Don't get me wrong, Dave Mustaine is a personel hero of mine, but I would not listen to this new effort. On the other hand, The System Has Failed was the best thing Megadeth has put out since Rust in Peace. Having Chris Polland back on guitar gave the music that frantic energy Megadeth had back in the day. Not to mention impecable musicianship that Megadeth sometime loses when Dave changes band mates so often."
5,Best 'Deth-release since Rust In Peace!,"Listen to ""Sleepwalker"", ""Play For Blood"", ""Never Walk Alone..A Call To Arms"" and ""Gears of War"" and you know what I'm talking about!"
5,Megadeth Sells...I'm Buying!,"Megadeth's new album, United Abominations, is a great disc. I have been a Megadeth fan since 1992 and they have never disappointed me (yes, I even love Risk). On UA, Dave Mustaine and crew return to form, so to speak. The fast riffs are back, the blistering solos are even more intense, Dave's voice is in top form, and the hooks are so catchy you'll be singing the songs for days. I haven't stopped listening since I bought it, and I don't see myself stopping in the near future. Standout tracks, in my opinion, are Sleepwalker, Washington is Next, Never Walk Alone...A Call To Arms, United Abominations, and Amerikhastan, tho all of them are amazing. If you thought Megadeth was ""back"" with The System Has Failed, then you are in for a real treat with UA. Pick this one up for yourself and some friends, they won't be able to thank you enough. Definitely album of the year for me, and we still have 6 1/2 months left, but no one will top this! Welcome back, 'Deth!"
5,Awesome,"Much, much better than System Has Failed. This is what I want in a Megadeth album- lots of high energy music!"
3,Dave's return to form?,"After The World Needs A Hero and The System Has Failed, I had assumed when Dave once again labeled his upcoming album a return to form, that he was just shooting off at the mouth again. The previous two albums were quite heavy on the filler, with only moments of that Megadeth genius shining through. This album essentially delivers on the promises made. It's not that there are a plethora of standout tracks begging to be heard by fans of the band, rather, when heard in it's entirety this album is quite satisfying. It's basically the closest Dave has gotten to Countdown To Extinction, a thrash oriented affair with plenty of catchy well placed chorus'. ""Never Walk Alone"" is among the best songs Dave has written this side Youthanasia. A well placed intro riff harkening back to Peace Sells, and a catchy chorus. This album is pretty tasty overall, if not a bit irrelevant in regards to it's standing in the great legacy of Megadeth's back catalog."
3,Nothing special,"If you're an Megadeth fan then you need to own this album simply to complete you collection but ""The System Has Failed"" was much better. A few of the tracks really grab you, but then some just annoy the hell out you."
3,"Meh ... it's not bad, but could be better","First, I'm a HUGE Megadeth fan and have been listening to them for years ... through all the lineup changes, so I was really psyched for this CD's drop date.I gotta say that this CD is a disappointment. I've listened to it at least a dozen times and it just feels like Dave is running out of ideas. As I listen to this disc, I find myself thinking, ""I swear I've heard this song before.""Marty Friedman seemed to really inspire the band when he was in and he absence is huge now, IMO.The CD isn't bad, it just isn't as good as I hoped it was going to be."
5,very good,The Megadeath realse United Abominations is great!! it has awesome sound and great song writing if you like metal this is a must have
4,Ongoing Megadeth excellency,"This album has got all the necessary ingredients any Megadeth fan expects. Buy with no worries, it is a must have.Set me Free Remix with Cristina Scabbia is not much more different than the original one. It could be performed with a more different approach, but it is OK."
3,Another Step In The Right Direction,"I see this album compared to its predecessor, The System Has Failed, more often than not. Personally, I can't hear the similarities. The System Has Failed had some really inspired tracks with some great solos by both Mustaine and Poland. Untied Abominations on the other hands has only a few good songs and a few good solos from Mustaine and Glen Drover. Shawn Drover sounds stiff and out of place to me, but others appear to dig him so maybe I'm the black sheep of the Megafans.The production of this album doesn't do it any favors either. Its not bad but it lacks balls, the entire albums feels really squashed and small. The System Has Failed also had some production issues but it still had a sound that had some size to it.Overall, its another step in the right direction for Mustaine and company. Check this one out after most of the previous albums."
3,System has failed II,This album should have been called The System Has Failed 2. It is almost the same sounding album as United Abominations. But thats ok compared to Risk and Cryptic Writings. This is a good string of albums since The world needs a hero.
5,This CD Rocks!,"This is one of Dave Mustaines best CD's ever! He has finally found the best line up, and together they are electric."
3,The title says it all...,"Quite a lot has already been said as to what makes this album bad and what makes it good. Unfortunately, there is more of the former on this album. ""Sleepwalker"" is an okay opener with a great chorus and there's something about ""Blessed Are The Dead"" I also really like. But the rest of the album just doesn't do the Megadeth legacy justice. The ""A Tout Le Monde"" remake just makes me cringe. I was very pleased with The System Has Failed, so I don't know what went wrong this time around. I'll give it 3 stars (2.5, really) for the parts I do like and for being a longtime fan of the band. Upon subsequent hearings of the album, I've come to the conclusion that United Abominations is a very appropriate title."
2,Yawn ...,"Very boring. Not an original or catchy riff in sight. Mustaine's mindless, political jibber jabber (which is neither Republican nor Democratic--it tries to be more Libertarian) and the inane spoken word parts are difficult to swallow."
2,better than the last 6 cd but still sucks badly,"dave was great, megadeth had some good years of music but this cd sucks bad.dave should go shoot up some smack with his born again friends and call it a day!"
3,Too Short,"This Album is 47 minutes and 58 seconds long. Taking exception to older albums that were limited to a cassette or older, it rather upsets me when bands do not fill the space given on a CD (80 minutes max) they used just over half. Perhaps it is not their fault and we should put the blame on the record label, but I was deprived of about 32 minutes of potential music."
2,good as long as you don't listen to the vocals,"I became an instant Megadeth fan back since Countdown to Extinction. I LOVE Youthenasia, System has Failed, and Cryptic Writings. I've even seen them a few times in concert. Their sound is classic Megadeth, however the lyrics make this CD less than stellar. Although there are a couple good songs on this CD, Dave forces his messed up political views to a point where it is forced. So much, that you feel silly listening along. Although he has always had political views in his music (which makes Dave great), he just rambles in this one.Once again there are a couple good songs, but this is definitely a forgettable CD. I am hoping a few more listens of this CD will help change my opinion, but not likely."
1,Why do they bother? Why did I bother?,"I had written off Megadeth after hearing Risk and decided not to hear anymore new music from them. Then being inspired by the election of a new president that I'm unhappy with I was reminded of Dave's lyrics on some of their songs off CTE. And that got me wondering, what do they sound like now anyway? It seems that no one can put out anything even reasonably fresh or original anymore. Same here. And the less said about Cristiana's pop emo vocals on what was a fairly good song the better. Like the new pres, this one's an obamination."
1,"""Online Fitness"" fails to ship... twice!","On two occasions I ordered a purple fanny pack from Online Fitness. In both cases they kept me waiting over a week before cancelling both orders. It appears they take orders for merchandise they don't have, but hope to obtain. They failed to answer my emails or advise me as to my order status.As far as I am concerned I will never do business with this company, Online Fitness, again."
1,Not sure if it's safe or not,"After CPSC recalled a toy box made by delta, I am not even sure whether to buy any more products from them. Would any of you know if this item is free from lead paint?"
3,"where the hell is ""on my own""?","trust me--without the inclusion of that song, you've never heard the best of b.w. stevenson."
5,Long Live B.W. Stevenson!,"I first experienced B.W. Stevenson by watching the outstanding musical show ""Austin City Limits"".This was also during the time that Jerry Jeff Walker was a regular on the show. I found B. W. Stevenson to be very impressive.When thesong that was originally recorded by B. W. Stevenson""My Maria""was brought back to popularity by Brooks and Dunn a radio discjockey on a Houston radio station asked who had originally sangthe song.I called the radio station and answered B.W. Stevenson.I was happy to see his song ""My Maria"" become a hit.This CD hassome of the best songs recorded by B.W. Stevenson.Another songdone by B.W. Stevenson was ""Shambala"" which was also picked upby Three Dog Night.This album has his top songs and if you listen to it you will become a fan.He died much too young."
3,Not to bad,"Instrumentation throughout is pretty darn good, however, after the first six tracks it becomes somewhat mundane."
5,Buckwheat,"I guess growning up on the border in El Paso and living through the progressive country era of th early 70s made me decide to comment.Im real surprised at how many people out there that remember BW and his early days.I saw BW,Rusty Weir and Ray Wylie at the tarrant county theater back in November of 72.Great show.I guess my Favorite Bw would be We Be Sailin.I lived in FT Worth back when he passed.Such talent he had.I have all his LPs on Cd and this Best of is a must for BW fans..."
5,WORTH THE WAIT,THERE ARE FEW SINGER / SONG WRITERS THAT CAN MATCH THE TALENT OF B.W. STEVENSON. IT IS RARE WHEN THE MUSIC AND WORDS FIT PERFECTLY BUT THIS IS WHAT OCCURS WITH EACH RECORDING ON THIS ALBUM. AS GREAT AS THIS MOST RECENT ALBUM IS THERE IS SO MUCH MORE MUSIC THAT B.W. DID THAT SHOULD BE RELEASED.
2,english bottom of the screen,"SUCKED...not even in english..2 very dizzy women..this one was another barn burner,a total waste of my money..Don't buy it..there is lots/lots of better gay films out there.."
5,"Triffle large, get the 3's before this set.",These clamps have been around for ever. Any good woodworking shop has a pile of them. Get them in pairs at a minimum and get a variety of sizes you won't be sorry. They'll last your lifetime and longer.Oh yeah the other dimension you need to know is the distance from the tip to the middle spindle on this clamp is 8 inches.
5,Love this sorter!,"I bought this sorter as a replacement for a Fisher Price one that we got as a gift, because I noticed my daughter loved to chew on the plastic. I didn't feel very good about that, so I got this one instead. At almost 9 months old, she loves it, and the shapes are just the right size for her chubby little hands to grasp. It's great that the little roof that opens doesn't pinch her when she slams it shut, and she likes to scrape her finger on the bottom of the house because it makes an interesting noise. She's chewed the pieces and so far, no paint has even come off (even though it's non-toxic). We also have the Wonderworld Peekaboo ball which was her very favorite first toy."
5,Great Little Sorter,I bought this for my one year old son. The little house is very well made and my son loves playing with the toy. He likes opening and closing the roof and taking the pieces in and out of the house. He is working on getting the shapes through the proper holes and managed to get the circle in this weekend.
4,Very cute,"This was my daughter's favorite Christmas gift. She is a year old and will have plenty of time to figure out how to insert the pieces correctly. Right now, she's enjoying lifting the roof to put pieces inside that way. My only complaint is that the paint has already started to wear off the blocks."
4,Works as described,The nice thing about this shape sorter as compared to some others is that you have to use the correct hole; you can't just shove all the items through one of the holes.
3,Good novel on police procedure. Great summer read.,"As in his other two novels, John Mackie is more concerned with police procedure and catching the bad guys than with the ""shoot 'em up action"" found in other novels.This novel is timely in that it centers around revenge killings of priests, current and former, for molestations in a NYC boys school during the '60s. Throw in a plot to kill the Pope and you have a page turner.Something to enjoy on the beach or a long plane flight. Does not require a lot of concentration. Some of the sub plots, regarding the homicide squad, are better enjoyed if Mackie's first two books have been read."
4,Great!!!,Bought this for a family member and they absolutely love it! This CD even brought back a few childhood memories of my own. Definitely a great pick up!!!
4,what cant we all just get along ...,that great american -rodney king - had it right .. war ..ha ..what is it good for .. absolutely nuddin' ... good book
3,Good but I have seen better,"This book is ok. The problem I had with it is the translations of some of the accounts are not done very well. Some of them are pretty good, but I have read translations of some of the accounts in other books and I found the translations holding more to the intent of author. Though this book has this problem, when push comes to shove it is a good book with good insight. This is a great book for ppl who have problems reading translations that stick more to the original content of the document."
2,Boring. Lame.,Couldn't finish it. Boring and awkwardly written. The omnipresent sexual themes are very poorly integrated into the rest of the story. The characters are sexual stereotypes. The sex scenes are boring and poorly written. There is nothing erotic about them. I assume the other reviews here are from friends of the author.
4,first Buruma dose is a good one,"Buruma has the key to a door I, a newbie Nipponophile, use: cinema. His own personality leaks tastefully into his blend of experience and academics. Just the levels I like! Some of the articles are a little outside my area of interest, but he managed to hook me into finishing them."
2,"uh, okay but lacking presence....","I've tried and tried to tune into this album, but it doesn't click for me. I love the opening track, 'Call out the Lions', 'Fire Hill' (except for that aggravating Woody Woodpecker guitar solor - YUCK) and 'Deep Country Sorcerer', but that's about it. I can't even make it past Deep Country Sorcerer - i lose interest real fast. not great. You want ROYAL TRUX great? get THANK YOU, VETERANS OF DISORDER and ACCELERATOR. Thanks for reading."
4,Comparison,"I enjoyed this Israeli film; had seen the one with Helen Mirren,(THE DEBT) but there were some surprising differences. Want to see the H. Mirren one again. The original film from Israel is titled Ha HA HOV and is subtitled."
4,Great spy thriller,Saw this movie again for the second time to see Ms. Chastain's performance as an executioner. Great movie watching. Recommend.
4,Great Music (seems like the message was in there somewhere),"The music was very well produced and I enjoyed every track. Talented young man that, we as a family have listed to in the background when we are spending family time. This CD is more geared toward people who are transitioning from the world to the Word. Every key has a lock.I would recommend this CD and I'm looking forward to getting the next CD."
2,A few song are nice other than that...,"After growing up listening to hip-hop and r&b, and really being a fan of R&B. If you would have played some of the tracks on a hip hop station, i would not have known they where Christian or not. To me overall the CD is borderline ""worldy"". I have had the CD for about a 2 years, and ""Stay Staved"" and there are a few others that are okay, but some of the song make you want to go to the club and that is not a good thing when you profess to be a christian."
5,password,"I purchased this cd after watching Holy Hip Hop, and I can't stop playing it. I love track 6. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that loves Christian rap."
2,Which is it?,"I really do respect this album, I respect the purpose or atleast what I think is the purpose. Very good songs, Canton Jones touches upon things that very Gospel artists touch upon. But I worry about the motivation for doing his music and how much of ""the world"" inspires his writing. His first words of the album, I believe are ""We about to throw 30 grand on the crowd"" and clearly the first song ""Doin' it Big"" is all about him, I wonder if his purpose is to make Christ seem appealing to the world or make the world seem appealing to Christ. To each his own though. May God bless him and all of us as we strive for Heaven"
5,Hip Hop For The Gospel,"This is a wonderful C.D. Canton Jones knows and understands hip-hop and he uses it beautifully for the gospel of Christ. From the gritty 'Who's Doing It Big' to the Motown inspired 'Love Song', Jones pulls out all of the stops. I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone who's interested in up-to-date Christian music."
5,Pepper pot,We should flood campbell's head quarters with our shock that Pepper Pot and Scotch Broth have ceased to exist.Maybe a public issue would take some effect
4,Glad to find this soup at a fair price with free shipping,"The local store here charges over $4/can and I was happy to find it on Amazon for less. Other web grocers carry the product, but nail you with shipping fees. I have only two complaints: This was actually a gift for my husband, so I was a bit disappointed that half of the cans arrived dented. I also was a bit hesitant to order these because Amazon listed them at time of purchase as ""Pepper Potato Soup"", and not Pepper ""Pot"" Soup which was pictured and described in detail on the website. If you are looking for Campbell's Pepper Pot Soup that is made in Canada, this is the real deal."
3,Choppily written,"This book seems to have been written to run about 500 pages before it was cut down to its final length of 338 pages. many of the sections I've read have been difficult to truly understand--sometimes the authors makes claims that need more explanation, and other times the sentences or paragraphs seem to be non sequitors. Great images, though."
3,A good clamp - with limitations.,"These clamps are the little cousin of Pony's great 3/4"" pipe clamps. While the 1/2"" clamps work fine within their limits, they do have limits. Applying a lot of pressure will flex a 1/2"" pipe, possibly leading to an out of square joint. I also do not think that the clamp tightening mechanism is as well made as on the 3/4"" clamps, but it is still pretty good. I have several of these clamps and while I think they are a good value for the money, I would suggest spending a few more dollars for the 3/4"" clamps."
3,"Go for 3/4"" instead","I had these (first clamps I purchased) and the 3/4"" clamps. They all ended up at my dad's house and had to replace them. I didn't bother replacing the 1/2"" because they flex too much. They might be fine with a 2' section of pipe to make a short clamp. I had a 4' pipe in mine."
5,Score for Holst's The Planets,"The score for The Planets, which I had ordered as part of reearch for a book I am writing, arrived quickly and was in fine shape."
1,"""On the Road"", as told by a Willie G patron","I brought it, I read it but I won't read it twice. If you can find the copy I threw out, then, I recommend reading it, otherwise your money is best spent on....well, on anything else. Wintner is just one more peddler who slaps Harley on some junk and sells it as the real thing, (much like Willie G). I wonder if the real ""Outlaws"" know that Wintner ripped off their name? I wonder if they will get the royalities due?"
5,Are you ready to ride?,"If you are thinking of joining the new biker revolution, buy this book and take it for a test ride first. It is concentrated romp dealing with men that are growing older, wives, lives and choices.I found it to be an entertaining look at life that can be found on two wheels and deals with the reality of what one may find out there and also what one may create for themselves with the road as open as the possibilities.If, after reading this you think that you are ready, waste no time! Go buy the bike, get some rain gear and saddle up. If you have doubts, put down the book, back away from the bike and grab a remote, perhaps a sailboat is more appropriate."
2,"Not really PAINFUL, but........","I found this book tedious to read, and somewhat dissorganized.It is about bikes and bikers, but the author's ramblings make it very difficult to remain focussed or ""get in the groove"" so that the story flows smoothly. The author continually breaks from topic to self analysis and rhetoric that demonstrates his attempt to master the literary vocabulary while forcing the reader to wonder ""where are we going with this?""The book wasn't excrutiatingly painfull until the last 25 pages, but I just couldn't get through the epilog, for fear my eyes would bleed.With a little less psycobable, this could have been a terrific read!!Nearly, but not quite a total waste of money."
3,So cute! & So Sharp too! (at first),"I have had these knives for a few months now. I personally really love it. I don't use it that regularly though, since we do not cook too often at our house, so I'm not sure if it's the right set for people who always cook at home or not. I love them. They are so sharp and they're super cute!Edit: I think they do get dull pretty quickly though. After a few months, I noticed that they weren't as sharp as before and I really don't use them that much."
3,Prettiest knives ever!,"This set of knives are so pretty, they are a great gift for women.However, there are some drawbacks, namely that they cannot be sharpened due to the non stick coating (all knives need to be sharpened), and that the non stick coating doesn't actually work. In fact I found that things like potatoes and garlic tend to stick even more than to traditional knives. Also, the bread knife isn't sturdy enough for regular cutting, or harder loaves."
2,Disappointing,"I unfortunately cannot rave about this book as others have. Some sections do provide good strait forward information especially for new graduates starting in an ICU such as myself. Other sections are terrible such as the med chapter where almost every other medication the author states something along the lines of ""I don't know much about this one""...how is that helpful at all? Also this book was last updated in 2007. A lot can change in 5 years especially in the medical field so I never know if I'm reading correct information or not. My advice is save your money and buy a book that you can be assured is up to date and helpful (I'm still searching for one any suggestions?)."
2,The stupidest jokes ever. I wish I were dead every time I read this.,"To be fair, there is some good info here for almost anyone doing any type of patient care; there are some things everyone should know.The crux is that the pathetically stupid jokes constantly interrupt what little continuity there is and make the thing almost unreadable. Combined with the stupid and annoying lacks of info disguised as questions it gets old quickly. If I wanted to go look up info I'd buy a book. Oh, wait, I bought this one. Why isn't it edited to include stuff instead of asking me to fill in the blanks? The next version needs to replace all the in-passage questions with solid information and lose the lame old-woman humor. It's embarrassing.In hindsight, if you can get this for twenty bucks or less buy it, a penny more and you'd have to be an idiot. Or a nurse."
5,Go Harold!,This isn't by Crockett Johnson but we can't tell the difference. The cheetahs are pretty neat and the elephant is so cute. We really like the ending!
4,loves harold,Just adorable. But a little disappointing that the story does not follow the tv series exactly. Much is left out even though HBO family label is on book cover. The title is different as well so I should have guessed there would be differences. I thought maybe some scenes left out not different storyline... But it serves the purpose of reading to my child what he loves...
2,Why not get the real thing?,"With the possible exception of Buddy Guy, SRV played with more intensity than any of these guys. In his interview Clapton says that, after he heard SRV he (Clapton) was embarrassed to go on stage. And rightly so. Buddy Guy & Bonnie Raitt are terrific; B.B. King is B.B. King. Robert Cray continues to underwhelm and Jimmy Vaughan does his best. Eric continues to be a crowd pleaser but how far he has fallen from All Your Lovin' or Layla or White Room or Crossroads or...."
1,Unwanted add-on,I purchased a kindle and 3 CD's were unexpectedly added to the order. Shame on you... Returned the cd's and my opinion of Amazon dropped several degrees!!!!
4,Remember,The dvd was as advertised - excellent musicians playing Stevie Ray Vaughan music. It reminds you what a talented musician SRV was and how sad it is that we lost him at such a young age.
5,Live Blues SRV style,"I had this in VHS format but, wanted the DVD because of the better technology and the improved visual/sound quality. Stevie has always brought me to the heart of the Austin high power blues venue."
1,"Yes, it is a waste of money.","I don't normally like to give items bad reviews, but please do not buy this product. All I was looking for was a beginner set to practice on before getting a more expensive set. However, these will not play at all, and even an experienced piper could not get them to work."
2,Overpriced and too short....,"Luckily, I didn't buy this book at Amazon and thankful that I did not. For 96 pages of information (rest is index), this book is grossly overpriced. The material isn't too bad and its quite informative if your knowledge of Imperial Roman administraton is limited. The book discussed how client kings works, how cities were managed and all that. But the writing is bit dry, it felt more like a college thesis then a professional work since due to short length, it summarized a lot. A good introduction book for the subject matter but you should not pay $21.95 for this thin book whose material don't rise that high."
2,Not Too Happy,Not too happy at all with this purchase. I bought it as a Christmas present for my husband. He has already had to send it back once because it quit working. They sent him a new one but now that one is about ready to die. Not a good idea to purchase this.
1,Broken in 2 Weeks,Lighter looked well made but ignitor failed after only 2 weeks. Returned for refund. Save your money...JUNK!!!
1,Dimb and infantile,"If you enjoy a book that revolves around denigrating soldiers then buy this book. The author seems to have a thing for using expletives and describing sick, yet totally unrealistic situations. This book is sooooo bad, that after the first two chapters I not only stopped reading it, but threw it in the garbage where it belongs. If you want good novels about the era about the German army, then read the books written by Willy Heinrich (Crack of Doom, Cross Of Iron) or Sven Hassel (Comrades of War, Legion of the Damned, Wheels of Terror)."
2,disappointed,I was very disappointed. I expected something really good to meditate to. It's OK for moving meditation; the music is very repetative. I would give it 2 1/2 stars at most...
3,A decent performance,"When I was looking for a recording of Haendel's Messiah, this was the first one I bought. At first I loved it, but when I got the Boston Baroque Orchestra recording, I noticed the many flaws this one has. The only highlight: David Van Asch singing ""But who may abide"", based on the original version. Other recordings use a more recent version, more dramatical and written for a mezzosoprano, but it can't compare with the original for bass.If you are a fan of baroque music in general, and specially Haendel, skip this one. You will be disappointed."
4,Think twice before you pay $$ for this addition!,"My son received this to go along with his other track accessories. When we are building tracks, the track that runs underneath this MUST be straight on, or the trains will hit the underside of the bridge. The wooden pull tabs that come out at the top to support the ""climbing"" track are neat. However, the next time I buy a bridge, I'll double check the clearance."
5,"Sturdy, easy to use","The pieces are incredibly stable; you can even pull out the little wooden tabs and add another piece of track between the viaduct pieces for variety. Unlike other reviewers, we haven't had any difficulty with engines getting stuck on the ramp up. The engines-won't-fit-underneath-unless-the-track-is-perfectly-straight problem is only mildly annoying; a little wiggle of the track usually changes the angle enough to get the trains through without frustrating my 4-year-old."
2,Not even effective as no-brand polarizer,"I ordered this polarizer because in some articles i have read that linears are more effective than circular polarizers.I have one ""hoya circular"", one ""no-brand circular"" polarizers as well. This tiffen did not prove its brand because unfortunately it is not even as effective as my no-brand cheap cheap circular polarizer. Comparing 3 of them i can see hoya-cir is absolutely more effective in wiping reflections.My friend has a circular tiffen, it was like the same effective as Hoya-cir. But this linear is a total dissappointment.I returned."
4,"Excellent price, good quality",Tiffen offers better than average quality at a decent price. This is no exception. This same filter would have cost me twice as much if I bought it at a local store.
1,Very weak polarizing effect!,"Stacking two polarizers, and rotating one, should at a certain angle lead to no light getting through, black, dark, nothing. Not so with this one, it's very weak in this regard. This might be fine for landscape photography, but in many applications a very strong elimination of reflections is desired. If this filter is weak, why don't they say so in the tech specs? I bought some better polarizers, and much more expensive ones, which actually do what they are supposed to, total black when stacked and turned in a specific angle to each other."
4,Shipped dirty but cleaned up nicely,"I got this linear polarizer for my Lumix GH1. Despite the very protective case, the filter inside was quite dusty and definitely not indicative of quality optical equipment. However, the dust wiped off cleanly with an alcohol lens cleaning cloth for eyeglasses, and the filter works well."
1,Don't buy this for your digital slr,"I got this polarizer filter thinking it did the same thing as a circular polarizer but it's not the same. It's a LINEAR polarizer as opposed to a CIRCULAR polarizer. If you have a DSLR, get a CIRCULAR polarizer. A LINEAR polarizer won't be able to meter or autofocus correctly. I didn't know this when I bought it and it didn't say anything about it in the product description. It didn't work on my Nikon D7000, so I returned it.If you're shooting film, I'm sure this could be a nice filter."
2,Not good for a variable neutral density filter,"I bought this to construct a variable neutral density filter in combination with a circular polarizer. It turns out that the polarization ratio of this filter is only about 20:1, which is significantly less than the cheap CPL I was going to pair it with. While this is OK for uses against clouds and reflections, it means the for a neutral density filter you can only get down about 4 stops.In terms of build quality it is fine. It would be nice if the ring were a bit narrower, as it vignettes slightly at 18mm on an APS-C camera."
2,Expected Better,I purchased the 46mm linear polarizer for my Panasonic FZ28. The fit between the two elements is loose and moves on it's own sometimes. It is also too thick because it causes vignetting in the corners at wide angles.
3,Maybe because...,"Why is it not record of the year? Maybe because, in the U.S. at least, as of Feb '06 it is only available as an import and costs $31. Give me a break!"
1,DON'T EVEN CONSIDER THIS PRODUCT,"I purchased this shredder for light, home use. I picked this model bcause it seemed to be in the mid-price range of the smaller, home office / light-use shredders. After very light use (maybe 3-4 times per week) over 2 months, it quit working. It seems like the motor just gave out. Nothing ever got stuck in it, and I never overloaded it. I paid $40+ for this shredder, and now it is in the garbage!"
4,"yes, but ...","I've been using this book on and off over the last year. At first I was very impressed with the level of detail in the mathematics, especially as it was the only book at the time focussing on risk-neutral methods and covering BGM. But I've become increasing disillusioned with it of late. It's difficult to explain, but although the whole book is written in traditional theorem-proof style, there are no real proofs! (I have a PhD in math and have done research for 10 years so I should know a little about proofs.) The only ""proofs"" provided are basically symbol shifting, but the heart of the math is strangely absent. This is especially strange given the Springer series in which it appears.In short, if you want a catalogue of methods this book does the job, but if you want a deeper understanding try Lars Nielsens book."
5,Excellent introductory book to financial math,"This book takes you through the math of finance step-by-step, passing through very simple examples first and then slowly adding complexity to the models studied. It is written very clearly and the prerequisites to reading this book are only some basic notions of probabilities (sigma-fields, probability measures).Sometimes, the problem with math books is that they are ""dry"" and contain only a succession of theorems and proofs. In this one, the authors make a point of explaining in detail how different theorems and models relate to each other, and make extensive comparisons between them so that you get a better feel for how they work in practice.The book is primarily a math book and can be light on market specifics. Do not buy this book as a practical ""howto"" in derivatives trading."
1,Another time when I need ZERO stars.,"This has got to be the worst album of all time - it's that simple. While there are a few moments on this album where you think to yourself; 'hmm.. maybe I won't have to chew my own arm off to get my money back on this disc', they're quickly shot down by every vocalist sounding like he's had cancer of the larynx and had his voice box removed. These 'death metal' covers have little (sometimes none whatsoever) resemblance to their rockin' originals. The 'musicianship' on this album (to use the term loosely) does NOT have to be heard to be believed. Just think of a Rhesus monkey on Methodone playing a guitar while trying to shove is head into the nearest knothole in a wall and you'll have an idea of the sonic quality of this disc. If you see this disc at your store.. run, don't walk, away from it. The wallet you save may be your very own."
1,Absolutely dreadful....,"Awful beyond beliefNothing wrong with giving old songs a new twist, that's what makes good cover songs, this is just awful horribly-bland death metal adaptations, I wouldn't mind death metal but the execution is just AWFUL, on all frontsIn short: CRAP"
4,comfort and support,hard to find a supportive cotton soft cuphas good side support will not roll up and shiftwish for 46s
1,run very small,"As a few others have said these run very small and the band is extremely tight.. They are in no way true to size. Also if you remove the tag and want to return it... all returns must be received with tags attached, if not they charge a 10% repricing fee. Whatever that means. Seeing that it will probably cost me half or what I payed to return it I will take the loss. They probably hope everyone will do that as they really are discouraging returns it seems."
1,"Okay, not great","These bras are undersized. I ordered a little larger, and they are very tight. The cups are the same way. These are supposed to be DD, but are closer to D.The underwire is halfway under my armpit. I got them for everyday, but they really are not comfortable"
4,Great Bra,I have been wearing these Bra's for years and they are so comfortable and wear very well. I probably order a few bra's every year and will continue too.
3,Wrong size...,Totally my fault but I did loose weight and found this does not fit the way it should. Not a bad bra just does not fit.
2,Combines all the worst of urban women's fiction,"This book is so poorly written that it could be the work of a sixth-grader. It is a book for people who think ""Friends"" is a reality show about life in New York. Who has ever heard of a waitress getting a terrific glamour job at a major conglomerate (for which she has no qualifications) because a customer likes her? The subplot about a former abusive boyfriend seems to be a throw-in to ""humanize"" the Cinderella protagonist. The ending is a cash-in on post 9/11 sentiment. It tries to capitalize on all the trends, and fails miserably."
3,Cute book with even cuter website!,"Vivian is imminently likeable, and following her through various relationships and career dilemmas is a lot of fun. You definitely have to suspend disbelief to buy the plot developments, but Vivian is a fun enough gal to make it worthwhile.The plot comes to a close pretty rapidly, without really developing the final events or characters, and the writing is only mediocre. It's Vivian's sheer charm that carries the book and makes it worth reading.You MUST see the companion website VivianLives.com!! WAY more fun, totally girly and captivating!"
2,Not that impressed....,"I LOVED The Autobiograpy of Vivian and think that I gave it ***** stars. Not so for the sequel. I find it hard to believe that the same person wrote Vivian Lives since I laughed*and*laughed at almost every page of her first novel.To be honest, I've forced myself to read maybe half of the book and am so dissapointed. I agree with other opinions that it's publicity hyped for her website www.vivianlives.com (which I still love).This sequel was such a let down to me that I would not recommend unless you have trouble falling asleep at night...."
1,I haven't finished it yet,"I just needed to know that I wasn't the only one who thought this book {was not good}. First of all, the author DESPERATELY needs a spell checker. I'm a sucker for grammar and even in the beginning of the book there are so many errors. Vivian appears to be a stupid woman desperate for attention and some kind of stardom. I'm not finished yet, but this book is an ego boost as I am planning to publish one day. If Krantz can be published, I should have no problem."
1,Fashion magazines are more thought provoking,"Painfully shallow and predictable book. Friends who don't normally read books recommended this to me, and loved its simplistic (written at a 3rd grade level), conversational writing style, and ""small town girl moves to the big city"" story. I just couldn't believe it could fill an entire book, and website, with no real content."
1,"Disjointed, not-even-fun fluff","It seems like the author felt an annoying need to insert as many pop culture references as humanly possible in order to save this sad, silly drivel. Look, I like chick lit as much as the next girl, and the website is really cute, but this book is a giant waste of time. It jumps between time frames, tells you how situations are going to end when they are just beginning, and speaks like a 15 year old girl."
4,GREAT READ,"I loved this book. I recently picked it for my book club... Its a really great read, clean and fun. its kind of like bridget jones- but cleaner, none of that dirty wording and stuff..... which is good. ... check it out! Its fun."
3,So-So,"Honestly, this is one of those books that I could go two different ways on. On the one hand, Vivian makes some rather hilarious observations. But, more often than not, you just want to stick your hand through the cover and slap her until she stops whining. This girl has a better life than most of us even dream of! So please Vivian, unless you are now living in a homeless shelter and eating out of dumpsters, SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!"
3,fun fluff,"No, it's not deep and thought-provoking, symbolic of anything, or the next Catcher in the Rye. But it's fun! Having done the NYC thing myself, I can say that the day-to-day lifestyle Vivian lives is realistic (not the VH1, dates with big stars parts, but the mundane apartment issues, dog poop, coffee and/or drinks with friends parts are accurate, as are the very fine firefighters!). The one discordant note is the backstory on Vivian's previous relationship--it's hard to buy that someone so well-adjusted has so recently survived such abuse. But Vivan's, or should I say Ms. Krantz's, easy-going, chatty voice is as easy to read as cool lemonade is to drink on a hot day. It's true, Ms. Ordinary can make it, just like anyone else. She just may have to shlepp a little more coffee to do it. A semi-inspiring, but mostly just fun, read."
1,What age group is this drivel for?,"Promoting herself as the heroine to the twentysomething female, Vivian Livingston is as flat as the cartoon on the cover. Filled with grammatical errors and ""cute"" spelling, this ""book"" is merely a weblog taken way too far. The so-called casual style is grating to say the least, and for those who do not subscribe to such format, it is hard to read.Vivianlives.com is a marketing tool that worked very well - and I see this book as an extention of that branding platform. It's probably a great read for young girls who want to dream of the ""luck"" with which Vivian lives her life, but beyond a fantasy, Vivian doesn't have any substance."
2,Why Do I Care About Vivian?,"Basically, the huge flaw in this book was that I just didn't give a damn about our heroine--Vivian. Everything comes way way too easy for her--winning a random songwriting contest, getting a cool job at VH1, meeting and dating celebs, etc... Oh wait, we are told (thrown in, more like it) that she went through 4 years of (grief) with a verbally and physically abusive ex. Vivian seems pretty well adjusted, considering. The writing style leaves much to be desired, and the only character quasi-developed is Vivian. I really didn't enjoy reading this, but it did pass a Sunday afternoon. This did not flow nearly as well as the ""Shopaholic"" duo, or ""Milkrun"", for that matter."
3,Time Passer,"This book intrigued me since I think the website vivianlives.com is really fun. This book is....ok. As in most Chick-Lit, a seemingly impossible event (winning a songwriting contest with no experience) turns the protagonist's world upside down, and thus she begins a 'new life' in NYC. We are told Vivian has suffered physical and emotional abuse for years at the hand of her 'boyfriend.' She lands a dream job with VH1, meets loads of 'cool people', and keeps chugging along in the search of love and happiness. 'Vivian' is not the most well written book, and it sometimes seems quite childish, but a decent read overall. Rather then buy it, I suggest getting it from the library."
3,Too many parentheses,"Typical story about single gal in the city, looking to find herself. Found it a bit unrealistic. She sounded a bit too normal for someone who was abused by her boyfriend for years. Winning a big songwriting contest with no experience or passion? Making tons of best friends after 5 minutes in a coffee shop? I'd like to know where this NY coffee shop is, the ones I go to people want to get their coffee and get out and call the cops if you're being overly friendly. But I hated all the (mostly) unnecessary parentheses. The most I counted were 5 in one paragraph. After reading the other reviews, I'd call her annoyingly chatty. Didn't get some of her (know what I mean?) references. Not the best chick-lit I've read, but halfway through I read it to pass the time."
5,Short Straight edge = High usage,"This short straight edge clamp gets the most use over any other. For router dados, cutoffs with circular saw and short partial straight cuts with the jigsaw nothing is easier or more accurate. Clamps hard and never slipped yet.Also makes a good clamp for cabinet glue up when a lot of clamps are needed."
4,"Not a master of the short story, but VERY funny","I like books that make me laugh out loud, though they're way too few and far between. This one had me laughing throughout, and for that reason alone it is well worth the read. And no, I don't think you'd have to be a guy to enjoy this one.Keillor's writing, besides being very funny, is very literate and clever. Many of the stories come across in much the same way his radio skits and monologues do. But - I wouldn't say that he's quite mastered the written short story genre just yet. Quite a few of the stories have endings that read like Keillor just decided that the story had gone on long enough, so let's see if we can wrap it up in the next 20 words or so. They kind of leave you hanging.However, stylistic demerits aside, this is one very funny book!"
2,15 year old's dream...,"On the one hand, these stories are clever and witty. On the other hand, they do a better job of emasculation than the ever present antagonists, women. It feels like a 15 year old's wet dreams come to life though written by an old bitter,albeit hilarious, man. Having listened to Keillor for years, I'm not entirely surprised at his hopes that men would be wild, bold and essentially irresponsible escapists (and therefore manly somehow), and that women should be silent, compliant sex toys. I am however disappointed that such a clever, learned fellow would try to pass off as misogyny as 'tongue in cheek'."
3,Not bad,"Again I see the sex obsessed version of Keillor. I believe there is only one of these stories that doesn't include some type of sexual moment. He is probably the best storyteller that I have ever heard, yet I am repelled by his books that cover topics outside the wholesomeness of his radio show. I can see how books can give him a creative freedom that can't be had on public radio. After reading them, it makes me wonder why he even tries going away from his comfort zone. A short story must grasp you from the beginning to the end. There is no room for slow, uninteresting periods. Yet, I only found a few of the stories in this book that captivated me throughout."
4,The Book of Guys,"This book is very funny. It has Garrisons usual dry wit that is reminiscent of Woody Allen at times. This book is filled with humorous stories about the folly of men and their skewed view of themselves and the things they try to achieve in life. Only a man could write this kind of book, as we would be terribly offended if a woman wrote it!!! When a guy says these things we can accept our foibles as true and laugh our socks off. A good, funny read.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,Modern Man is Somewhat Confused,"Garrison Keillor tells stories that have an impact. These stories have more depth than usual, more bite and no clean endings or morals. Men are different than women. Men were in some ways better off in the old days of an unconscious two class society. Some of the ""manly"" stereotypes do have appeal to most men from time to time. We still don't understand women very well. We're taking some time to find a new equilibrium of acceptable behaviors (to ourselves and to others). This is not a collection of side-splitting humor. Rather, it's like a fine wine or whiskey that has a long tail which twists and fades. Ultimately satisfying, but partially hidden, suggestive and mysterious."
2,Was this supposed to be funny?,"My husband and I did not enjoy this book. WE bought it on audio so we could enjoy it on a trip we were taking. We were grossed out by the ""nubile"" descriptions. The stories ambled with no points. It was like listening to soft porn at times. We were looking for some humor and the reviews sounded good. It's not. If you're looking for funny humor this is not the book for you. I also didn't think he read that well. I've heard much better."
4,Pretty good sixties rock,"I first heard (or saw an old clip of) The Move performing Fire Brigade on an old sixties TV show. What a great song I thought, so I went out and found this album which contains some great tracks. The first ten or so are the best, after that the album heads in a downward direction. Great rock from a little known outfit. Best songs, Fire Brigade, Disturbance, The Lemon Tree."
5,Can't go wrong with KEMs,"These cards get a lot of use in my house - at least once a week and they are still in excellent condition. They have even taken some abuse (spilled beer and other miscellaneous beverages) and they cleaned right up and were good as new. They slide easily on the table and are much easier to shuffle than regular old playing cards. In my opinion, definitely worth the money. During my last vacation in Las Vegas, I was at Binion's casino and they had the exact same KEM cards at the poker table (even the same color, design) so if they are good enough for Binion's, they're good enough for me."
5,Wounderful book.,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. You get hooked on it almost instantly. I think there is only one problem. I loved the ending, but it seemed to open, and not fully resolved. But, besides that, this is the greatest!"
3,Good... but not great.,"Hannah, Divided is a good book. The thing is, there is no real conflict, no real climax, and not a great conclusion. Hannah, Divided is more of a read-on-a-rainy saterday afternoon kind of book then a suspense-filled plot kind of book that keeps you hooked."
3,Doesn't go anywhere,"This book is o.k. I have to read it for the book club at school otherwise it would have been out the window. Once I started to read it, it was o.k. I agree with the reviewer before me, it didn't really go anywhere."
2,Cheesey at Times,"The movie is SLOW initially, and you cant ever decide if the Lawyer played by Gene Hackman sincerely care for the plantifs or if he simply likes winning lawsuites. it Sheds a VERY Negative light on the legal profession."
4,Good clamp,"This clamp is handing for the long clamping requirements, and the jaws have deep reach. The jaws are easy on the wood."
5,My HoU$ToN RoCkEtS JeRsEy,I wasent sure I was gowing to like the jersy but I Purchased it anyway. I soon as it got their I opend it and tried it on. I feel right in love with it that I wored it at my house!
1,Worst Trek book EVER!,"I've read a good deal of Trek books and I'd say that this one is the absolute worst! The characters are way wrong and they can't even SPELL right ""B'Lanna"", ""Seven-of-Nine"" And would tom Paris EVER in his life once say ""This one's a biggun captain"" or ""Ride 'n' hide"" NO!"
4,Great Voyager Book,This book is good as far as Voyager books go. This book would make a great episode. The whole story is about how Voyager gets drafted in to an alien fleet to fight their war. As far as chacters go there is little development in that area. Most of the chacters are a little boring and could have been developed more. The way they get voyager to fight this war is by kidnapping Chakotay and some other crew members. I really dought that if this was the tv show that the captain would fight an alien war even for Chakotay. This is just totally against the captains ethics. Overall it was good with the ever present small errors about voyager and the crew.
5,"An absolute ""Take No Prisoners"" action packed book!","I have read this book twice in the last three weeks, and I can't wait to read it again! This is what Voyager is all about. Showing that Janeway doesn't try and talk her way out of a fight, but goes the full ten rounds to save her ship and crew. That's what a real ship's captain should do, and Janeway pulls it off better than anyone else! I can recommend this book to any true Voyager fan who loves the action the show and wants to have the same thrill ride in a book."
4,Unusual Star Trek Book,"This book had some interesting ideas. For once, Voyager wasn't crippled after one shot. You get tired of reading books where Voyager loses all weapons and shields with one hit. They had a interesting dilemma for the main characters. The only problem in this book is that it somewhat copies ""Ragnavok"", another Voyager book"
4,Typical Voyager book which will please fans of the series,"Battle Lines takes the usual Voyager formula (the crew finds itself in the middle of a conflict between civilizations unknown to them and through hard work and mettle comes through with flying colors. Circumstances separate the crew into two parts, one led by Janeway & Tuvok, the other by Chakotay & Paris. Smiling through their injuries & gritting their teeth, they manage to pull everything off well & help the right side win. B'Elanna, Seven, the EMH, & Neelix are given rather short shrift, & Tom is made a little too flippant. However, all of them talk & behave very characteristically. I enjoyed the book very much & look forward to the next by this author."
4,"A good book, but a bit unintelligent...","The book tried an action based start, but didn't do it wery well, just as I just didn't.:)The book contains much action and maybe even crosses some borders of good writing, by using action as the only intrique, thus making the novel appear unintelligent, meaningless and commercial.But in a way this was a good change from the usual trek, although Voyager has been known to use action as a commercial tool on TV also, wich I think has injured the series' integrity and credibility.This book however goes even further, using the characters only as action heroes, but, also building those same characters in a way rarely seen on books and doing it, in some instancies well, and in some instancies not so well, often making the characters ""harder"" than they are.This, however, is easily forgivable and unimportant for the plot, only annoying.All in all I recomend this book for all Voyager fans. It has decent plot and interesting situations that alow good characterization."
2,Why no answers,"I tried to learn Russian in college. I was not succesful. The problem was the lack of guidance with the book. THe answers were unavailable, the instruction was minimal and the examples were virtually non existent. The book does teach vocabulary, but vocabulary is useless if one does not know the proper way to use it. Stick with Pimselur."
3,"Cute, but one bad message","I like how this book teaches young children about being mad and how it's a normal emotion, but I wasn't thrilled about how the main character thinks running away is a solution. We have changed some words in our copy to be more child appropriate."
1,Threw it right in the garbage...,My son was bringing books to me to read. I made the mistake of taking this out of the box and reading it to him before looking through it myself. It should the character getting mad each time he was told no. That was fine because it's normal to get mad. What I didn't care for was the solution to this - running away from home. Then when the character's friends came to play he figured he could just run away another day. When my son got mad at my husband a little while later the first thing he mentioned was running away.It's not even worth the postage to return it so the book is being sent out with the recycling garbage.
4,I Was So Mad by Mercer Mayer,"I think I Was So Mad, along with the other Mercer Mayer books, is a great book that kids can relate to and learn from. In this book, Little Critter espresses his feelings of frustration and of being angry in a way that most children do in at least one point of time in their life. I enjoyed reading Mercer Mayer books as a child and even now i can't help picking up one of these simple books to read when i see one."
1,CAUTION!,"This book glorifies that it is OK to get ""mad"" every time a child doesn't get their own way and climaxes in a horrible childish threat. Some of things the kid wanted to do were fine some were not but the book portrays the child as getting mad. He doesn't listen to adult suggestions just gets more mad. His solution? RUN AWAY FROM HOME! Yes, that's exactly the idea I want to put in my child's head. While as an adult I can separate the fiction and maybe see a little humor, my child certainly can NOT. When there are sooo many kids books out there of a high quality with good, positive messages, there is no need to subject your child to these immature ideas. VERY POOR BOOK."
4,Realistic portrayal of anger,"We have a lot of Little Critter books in this house. They're short, they're funny, they're topical, and they're cheap.This book is a very realistic portrayal of how frustration and anger can build up in a person, especially a child, and how they can keep you from wanting to do *anything*. My nieces really relate to this book.And there's even a realistically happy ending."
5,Excellent Children's series!,Little Critter is not having a great day but by the end of the book it becomes better for him. These are great read-along books for your budding readers. I have at least two whole sets of this series as my children plan to pass them onto their children to read.
5,Excellent teaching tool for parent or children,"I purchased these Mercer Mayer books for out youngest son Darius, as teaching tools for ""life"" concepts. Of late, I've been giving them to my adult children as teaching tools for LIFE concepts, they cross the generational gap easily. My older boy, Ben (twenty-eight) was initially aggravated, but he read it, smiled. We talked, he assured me that he now ""get's it"". I would highly recommend these for any parent."
4,"Great for discussing emotions, specifically ""mad""","I purchased this book when my students were learning about feelings. It's a pretty cute book that repeats key lines (e.g. ""I was so mad!""). This repetition helped my students to participate during story time--they could predict what was coming next. I also appreciate that the illustrations pretty accurately depict what a ""mad"" facial expression might look like. This book was fun, while also helping my little learners to understand the concept of ""mad"". It also lends itself to potential follow-up activities, such as discussing or illustrating things that might make your students/children upset or angry."
4,very cute,I think my nephews will enjoy the book since it's for the 7-yr old but makes cute story for 2yr old.
2,"I'm running away momma!""","This book grabbed my 2 year old toddler's ear right away. She understands what it is to be angry when being told ""NO"", which is why I assume she liked it so much as soon as it began.However, the part about running away from home because he was mad that he was being told no, only to get rewarded to go the park, is UNACCEPTABLE.Every time my child gets upset now she replies with a ""I'm running away Momma!"" which is a terrifying thought. She runs in the next room, but as a Mother all I can think of is the time it happens when we aren't at home.This book went right in the garbage, this shouldn't be something that a child thinks is okay. PERIOD!I'm on a book shopping spree just to get her to forget about it and memorize another sweeter, positive influencing book.Sincerely,Had A Mind To Write The Author About This ""Classic"" But I'm Sure Someone Already Beat Me To It"
5,Best shave cream on the market,"A little pricey but then again when is the best cheap? Smooth, silky, and love the fragrance.The quality really shows. I just wish it was not so hard to find. Everytime I do, I load up. It is the best by far."
1,Disappointing!,I bought this because everyone talked about the beautiful sound. I don't know but I guess you have to have ALOT OF WIND to make it chime. I've only heard it once and that was when Tropical Storm Isaac was heading our way. I have moved it twice to try to get more exposure to wind but it doesn't seem to matter. Right now it's on a high tree with nothing blocking the wind from hitting it. Very unhappy as it was heavy and difficult to hang. I'd return it but it probably would cost a small fortune to return so I'm considering it basically a garden sculpture!
2,"Way, Way too Big","This windbell is beautiful, but I had absolutely no place to hang it. It was way too heavy and was afraid to hang it on anything. I was going to try to hang it in one of my trees, but it wa so much bigger than my tree limbs. The sounds is just beautiful, but no place to hang it. I had to sadly return it."
4,Library Keeper,"Historial Information that all African American should know. A library keeper. It also, makes you even more aware of the unfair justice that Black American continue to go through."
3,Good history lesson,History behind it was good put the portrayal could have been better. You can tell the portrayal was in the directors direction and not the fault of the acting.
5,History come to life,It's a story about an era in history that should never be repeated. Let us show we are better people overall.
4,Sad but True,"This movie is based on the true story of Lena Baker. It is very heartbreaking. But for anyone who is interested in historical pieces, this is a good movie to get."
2,Blu-ray is of exceptionally poor quality and movie misses the mark,The Blu-Ray release from Germany is of exceptionally poor quality. The image is not even of DVD quality and there is so much noise at times that the video is almost drowned out. The movie is about an important time period and yet it is almost trivialized. The writing was particularly stilted and the characters one dimensional. The end was a foregone conclusion and there was no sense of building to that point. I hope there is a better treatment of Lena Baker's life in the future. There was so much potential wasted.
3,"My son likes this toy ""ok""","This toy is good but it is not one of my son's favorites. He does like when I squeak the turtle's head and sometimes will play with the legs and rings, but usually he favors other toys. I think it's a nice toy and made of good quality materials, just not his cup of tea."
5,WE LOVE TUCKER!,"We purchased Tucker for our son when he was about 2 months old. He is now four months old and is still thoroughly entertained. Tucker sits on my baby's tummy when he's in his car seat and is easy to grab and hold on to. Our baby now loves to chew on Tuckers feet and the plastic rings attached at the back. (We just realized the other day that Tucker squeaks when you squeeze his head.) He's colorful, cleans easily, and has lots more surprises for our son to discover as he grows (such as tucking his head and feet into his shell). We don't leave home without Tucker! Can't wait to get more toys from this line."
3,Cute First Toy,"I bought this toy for my son when he was 1 month old. It was the only toy he was interested in at that time. I would hang it his bassinet, and he would attempt to bat at it. It would hold his attention, like nothing else. He enjoyed looking in the mirror, and hearing the squeaks and rattles. He liked to explore the differernt textures. As my son got older (around 5 months or so), he became less interested in it, though. He then moved on to activity playmats, teething toys, and stacking toys."
5,My daughter loved this toy!,"Such a simple toy kept my daughter busy for so long! She loved it. From the time she was about six weeks old until about five months, she played with this thing non stop! She loved the mirror on the reverse side. And it is very soft and squishy which is nice so you don't have to worry about the baby scratching herself up... I was really glad I go this. I even used to hang it on the Carter's Butterfly gym with the mirror facing down so that when my daughter was on the mat looking up, she would look directly in the mirror and see herself! She loved it! Highly recommended!"
2,No real interest for my son,"My son liked the mirror and the sounds when he was very young (4wks-8wks). I haven't been able to get or keep his interest with it since. I mention it because I know there are other parents out there that have children that are only interested in toys that are very interactive, brighter and flashier and are more involved with their parents (help/supervision). The concept is great, but it is for the baby that likes quiet play and is maybe more studious."
5,Interesting to Infants,"We got this at a baby shower and it was a hit with the hostess's 2 month old. He stared and was so intrigued.Now, my daughter loves looking in the mirror and 'talking' to herself and to the brightly colored turtle.The different colors, sounds and textures have kept her interested.It is easy to attach to the stroller or carrier. (Just not on the carrier's handle since it is big enough to whack her in the face.)This is a practical toy that I will give out as gifts to friends expecting!"
5,Great choice for a gift!,"My daughter received this at birth from another new mommy-------she LOVES Tucker! She is now 5 months old and this is one of her favorites. Each leg makes different noises, there is a mirror on the tummy, and the rings make it easy to clip to links, her stroller, or car seat. Also, the head hides inside the body just like a real turtle. This is a great toy!"
4,cute and cuddly,"While Tucker does not seem to be my 4.5 month old son's favorite, he definitely keeps him busy for a while. He so far is making a great chew toy, and also a nice cuddle toy to help him fall asleep. My son seems to be getting more interested in looking at himself in the mirror on this cute turtle's tummy too. Perhaps as he gets older he will better appreciate the different rattles, patterns, textures and sounds that each of Tucker's feet make, and also his cute, squeaking, ""disappearing"" head. I love the overall design of the toy, from the cuddly softness, the patterns, textures and sounds, and the wonderul colors. Stimulating for baby's sense of touch and sight, and seems to be a great comfort toy as well."
5,From infancy into Toddler time,Tucker the Turtle has been a great toy for my daughter. She has played with from 3 months old and still plays with it at 9 months old. On her first flight at 4 months old that was the only toy I took and when she started crying I handed her her turtle and she stared in the mirror and played with the legs looking at the different colors and she stopped crying the remainder of the flight. Sometimes its the simple toys that last the longest. I also suggest Fisher Price Brilliant Basic shape sorter blocks for around $6.99 your child can have months of entertainment with you joining in as well! Enjoy Tucker the Turtle!
1,tucker,My daughter received this as a gift at 11 months. She wasn't interested in it then and still isn't 6 months later...it seems to interest much younger babies.
3,Just an Average Toy,"I pourchased this for my then 5 month old daughter after all the wonderful reviews. It's not as great as it sounds. If your child likes something simple, then purchase this! It is very durable and will likely last through a few children. My daughter is almost 9 months old, and still gets very little enjoyment from this."
2,Not Thrilled,This Lamaze Play & Grow didn't hold my son's attention. We've tried to reintroduce it to him and he still doesn't have interest. We also have Pup Squeak and Freddie the Firefly and he adores the Pup Squeak and likes the Freddie
1,VERGISSMEINNICHT!,"I have been e-mailing for a few months now in response to your offer to replace the movie. As I said, though I am not sure, I think I never received ""Tiger Shark"". At least, I have never seen it around the house. The problem is: after your e-mail some months ago, I've not heard again from you. If you send another copy and I DO find the original, I will send it back.vergissmeinnicht,Paul"
5,Music for my soul,great condition. Sounds great and has now scratches on it. Nadama is a wonderful musician. Needed to save money. Mahalo
1,Very Innacurate,We're having trouble with this thermometer...it doesn't seem to have a very consistent reading. One reading will say 101.4 and the next one will be 98.4. It jumps around so much and we're getting kind of tired of it.
1,NOT ACCURATE THERMOMETER,"WE HAVE USED THIS THERMOMETER FOR 4 MONTHS NOW (THE AGE OF OUR SON), AND ARE SICK AND TIRED OF HAVING ONE 97.1 READING, THEN 104.3 READING!!!! HOW IN THE WORLD CAN THIS THERMOMETER STILL BE ON THE SHELVES WITH HOW INNACURATE IT'S READINGS ARE???? DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$$$ OUR INSTINCTS HAVE HAD TO TELL US WHEN OUR SON IS RUNNING A FEVER, UNFORTUNATELY OUR THERMOMETER HAS NOT.....WE ARE PURCHASING A BETTER ONE!"
2,Disappointing,"I like Megadeth a lot. I actually came to this site looking for their new album ""RISK"". I didn't find it but, I came across another album that was a tribute to Megadeth. With my hopes up, I gave it a try and listened to it. The music was okay, nothing that I would recomend to others. I found the vocals to be a disappointment. There is no imitating Dave Mustane or Megadeth!!! If you want to here Megadeth you are just going to half to buy the real thing."
1,Its truly a wonder how this piece of trash got released!,"I'm a huge Megadeth fan but I don't understand why all these horrible Death Metal bands get a shot on the Tribute cd. I mean this cd is the biggest piece of music trash. Even if your are a hard core Megadeth fan stay away from this. Unless you don't mind useless screaming. I'll admit that the music sounds decent but the vocals are completely horrible.Listen...the moment I bought this cd I took my money and threw it in the trash. Don't let it happen to you. Buy the real Megadeth, I suggest Countdown to Extinction."
5,Hmmmm...... very interesting!,"Yes, very interesting that the death metal bands made it on this cd! Major kudos to Fatal Influence for an awesome rendition of ""Hook..."" Great job guys. Holy wars is really done well also. I give it 3 stars because it's megadeth music and 2 extra ones for hook and holy wars.... for a total of 5 stars. This cd is worth the money just for those two songs alone."
4,shweeeet!,"cool! the crappier songs (the conjuring) weren't very good to begin with, the hook in mouth is easily the best song on here. KIMB, She-Wolf, Take No Prisoners and Reckoning Day were better the first time."
4,Great Tuneage!,"A little disappointed in some of the bands vocals but some of the tracks are awesome! Holy Wars, The conjuring, Hook In Mouth, GREAT! Wouldn't say 5 stars, but was overall happy with this CD."
4,First flight,"The debut album from this great and inventive new age/meditation/pop-soul band. An album that's definitely on the more meditative side, in fact specially designed for yoga and meditation, and strongly reflecting their involvement in the Brahma Kumari 'movement'.For a fan of Lucinda Drayton like me, it's a bit disappointing that half the album is synth.-dominated instrumentals.Delightful music for your yoga session and for healing and relaxation. But for Bliss fans only a hint of what was to come. Highly recommended though as the atmosphere on the album is quiet, full of love and heart, and pointing to our inner stillness."
2,"""Spun Glass"" mp3 is a must have for yoga enthusiasts ........","I bought this because I really liked ""A Hundred Thousand Angels"" (from the later album of the same name), which has a very powerful melody, and Lucinda's vocal is ideally suited to it. But there is nothing quite of that calibre here.I like the instrumental ""Spun Glass"" which has a nice sound when played through speakers, but is a fraction raw played through headphones, which I prefer for this spacey style of composition. Nevertheless, I highly recommend buying the mp3 of this track for playing through speakers for yoga. It would sit very comfortably on a collection called ""Yoga All-Time Greatest Hits""! And note that there is much more variation in this composition than you will hear in the 30 second sample on the mp3 download page."
3,Maybe it just outperforms me...,"In my search for the ultimate rope, I decided to try the Aero Speed. It's highly promoted on Buddy Lee's website, and I've heard positive reports from fellow enthusiasts.I can't really elaborate on what the other reviewers wrote except I was displeased with the handles being 2 part assemblies (routinely unscrewing) and the chord being so easily kinked.The lightweight handle assembly is very light indeed. The swivel system is unique (and appeals to me). The problem of unscrewing during a workout should be addressed during assembly, not after purchase.I soaked the chord in boiling water to remove the kinks from packaging, but they returned easily and repeatedly from being stuffed (though loosely wound) into my gymbag.As a speed rope, I rate this about par for the course. It definitely doesn't tangle when I cross, unlike other speed ropes I've tried."
4,A weird look at the world of science fiction conventions,"This book rings true from the fans putting together a fanzine at the last minute to the various antics around the World Science Fiction Convention. Throw in some aliens to make it interesting and you get hilarity. Very off-the-wall, but science fiction fans will love it!"
3,interesting stuff,"i came across this album from a friend who is a big fan of dead prez. he heard of this album when m-1 from dead prez said this was one of his fav albums. this album is an album of beats with spoken word lyrics. messages are clear and interesting. in ""black people, what y'all gonna do"" the last poets speak of black people uniting to destroy all the negativity around them. ""od"" speaks of drugs. ""white man's got a g-d complex"" speaks of white people with their cars, etc. overall, the messages/lyrics are intersting and poignant. i would of liked to see some more intricate beats but i guess that the beats need to be simple so the words can be the centerpiece. recommended for poets and non-myopic people who want to hear great poetry about black men and their problems."
4,The Contender,"The Contender, even though it didn't seem like a book meant for a girl, caught my attention. The style of Robert Lipsytes Writing makes you feel like you are actually there in the story and interacting with the characters. You can visualize the Robbery at the Epsteins' store. You can smell the musty air in Donatelli's gym. I would reccomend this book to teenagers. I don't think that adults would enjoy it as much, because I don't think that it would be as easy for them to relate to what the main character, Alfred Brooks, is feeling. Under the age of 11 or 12 probally wouldn't understand the meaning of the book, or maybe they would but wouldn't be able to get the full experience of the reading because they can't feel what Robert Lipsyte was expressing. Overall, The Contender was full of fun suprises, and dreary times. I suggest you read this book!"
3,The Contender,"Alfred has truely changed he went from quitting high school, to working at Epstein's grocery store, then he had been a boxer till Donetelli had him quit. ButAlfred gave his all so technically in this book he is a contender he worked hard and when he gave up he went back in and tryed boxing again. It helps though if you like boxing though. It was a positive good book. So if you like boxing it makes it all the better when you read it. Especailly to visualize the parts/scenes in the book so all in all I would recommend to read it."
2,The Contender,"The contender iss about a troubled young boy growing up in Harlem. Drugs,violence and gangs are all around him. School is a word that dosent apply to him since he is a drop out.In this book the author takes you throgh the eyes of Alfred. Where his life becomes you.This compelling novel is one you won't forget.Alfred's struggle to find himself and something he's good at is what makes this book so realistic.If you want to find out how he finds something he's good and how he finds himself read The Contender."
3,the contender,"The Contender was a little above average book by Robert Lipstye. The characters seem to fall into place just right, but they left a little shortin description. Although it abruptly stopped, it left room for asecond book tha continues the whole story.Alfred Brooks, the main character seems to develop confidence and knowledge. He is a regular no body on the streets,until he meets Donatelli up at the neighborhood gym.Anyone will read on and on with this touching story of a boy that becomes a special person that he has always wanted to be."
4,The Contender,"This is a book about a high-school dropout, named Alfred Brooks. Alfred has had no motivation in his life, so it is up to him to make things happen for himself.While living with his aunt and twin cousins, Alfred decided he wants to become a boxer. One day he stumbles into a neighborhood gym and meets Mr. Donatelli, who will help Alfred discover his place in life. Along with many others who help Alfred usefull and show him love and the felling of beloning.This is a verry good, moving, and insperational book. It will show you how carring for someone can change everything one step at a time.I recommend you read The Contender to find out what happens to Alfred and his boxing carrer."
3,The Contender,"This book was okay. I think it revolved around other stuff than boxing. Like it revovled around Alfred's best friend jame's drug addiction. And that took a little focus off Alfred the main character of this story. Alfred in this story seemed like a reguluar guy to me. But it kept me excited to see if he would win or lose in his matches. The ending is really a surprize to me, I don't know if it will be for you, but take a good read at the book and find out. Overall I thaught the Contender was an average book with a few surprises in it. If your a boxing fan you would maybee want to pick it up."
3,The Contender,"Alfred is a kid who is just anouther guy. His best friend James is floating away from him. James is now a drug addict and is hanging out with the punk kids. Alfred has nothing to do in his life besides work at a grocery shop. Alfred finally thinks he wants to do something with his life whenever he goes to Donnatelli's gym. Donnatelli is a wierd, short, and pug faced man who is one of the many people who help Alfred get to the top. Find out how alfred gets to the top and if he can get his best friend back by reading the Contender."
5,Realistic and Suspenseful,"The Contender is a very realistic novel by Robert Lipsyte. The story is set in Harlem, New York, in the 1950's.The main character is Alfred Brooks, an African-American high school dropout. Alfred has absolutely no direction in his life. Ever since being little, Alfred has wanted to be somebody, but he doesn't think he can.Then, one night, Alfred goes up the stairs of a building which houses a local boxing club. He decides to begin training to become a boxer.This book can be suspenseful at times. Especially if you are wondering, ""What is Alfred going to do?""If this book sounds good to you, I suggest you read it. It is full of suspense, friendship, and above all, a character who has found direction in his life."
4,Truely Stories,"I read this book with my ESL teacher, and we didn't finish it yet. But I thought it is good. This book tells us all true things around us. So we can learn lots of things from it such as how did Alfred stand up and to be a champion."
4,Pretty good,"""The Contender"" wasn't a book I probably would have picked up off the shelf on my own. But since I was required to read it for school, I got into it. Turns out I loved the book! Great for a school book or just for fun!"
4,The Contender,"The Contender is a book about a young Harlem kid who's best friend is a drug addict and his only other friend is crippled. He basically lost everything. He only had one thing, boxing. He spent everyday in the gym, working out with his stern coach Donatelli. He trained, he worked hard, and he won, but he decided to stop. It ended up being the best decision he ever made."
3,The contender,"The contender, who would ever guess a highschool drop out sinking lower and lower into drugs would turn his life around over one decision.The decision was a very intelligent one too.I would have never even thought about getting the courage to do what Alfred(the main character)did.The only reason why he did what he did was to get in shape physically and mentally so that he could defend himself from the trouble he put on himself. His stern gym trainer, Donatellis, doubled as a guide for his successful fucture, boxing.I certainly had many favorite parts in this book,but my favorite would have to be the final fight(the ending).What I disliked was the pace of it, otherwise I encourage you to read this book. It was very inspiring."
3,My Review,"The Contender, for all you people who haven't read it, is about a boy named Alfred and what he goes through in New York City and how he wants to make it in boxing. I think that this book is a great motivational book. In my opinion, the author captures the behavior of the characters beautifully. My favorite character was Henry. He was Alfred's manager. Sort of. Henry always was happy even when the book got kind of gloomy. The Contender's feeling was mostly about the character's trouble but yet there was still an optimistic feeling about it because Alfred wouldn't give up. The fight's were written in great detail. There were exactly four fights in the book, and Alfred won three of them. That was a happy thing. But I felt that Alfred could be a little more mean. He felt remorse every time he would beat somebody in a fight. I reccomend this book for anyone who wants to read a good fight or read about a good party."
5,A great book I recommend for everyone.,I really like the book. Robert Lipsyte really described Alfred's life well. I think anyone and everyone should read this book.
2,The Contender,"Whether you are in Disney World or the suburbs, you won't like this book unless you like boxing. All it is about is a kid, Alfred, who wants to become a boxer. Although, the author does throw in a bit about friendship and making decisions. Furthermore, I would probably rate this book a two on a scale of one to five. The Contender did not interest me, but I'm not particularly fond of boxing either. So, for all of those boxing fans out there, you will probably like this book. I wouldn't recommend to others."
3,The Contender,"This book was not really my type of book, but I still thought it was good.The characters, at times, seem shallow, but are overall interesting. Alfred, the main character, has obstacles he must overcome. His friend, James, is a ... addict, who has only one person who really cares about him; Alfred. Alfred struggles to find himself through a series of 'tests', provided by his mentor/boxing trainer/surrogate father, Mr. Donatelli.The setting seemed appropriate for this book, and really made you relate to the story.The plot was fairly predictable, but there were some surprises."
4,The Contender,This book is about a boy named Alfred.He has a bad job at a corner store and he is a highschool dropout. His best friend james is hanging out with some bad people who decide to break into the store Alfred works at. They trigger an alarm and every runs but james who is cought and sent away. Alfred gets jumpt by james new friends because they thought he ment to get them cought at the store. Alfred is sick of his life and decides to be somebody. He goes down to the gym ware Mr Donatelli trains him to be a contender until he realizes something.
4,The Review,The book the contender was a good book that I rated a four star book. Thier were many reasons why I liked this book it was never boring or did it ever drag on. Alfred brooks was from Harlem New York and lived with his aunt. He had dropped out of school and was working at a grocery store bagging groceries. He had a best friend who had gotten into touble and some people blamed Alfred and beat him up for it. Alfred was tired of being scared and wanted to become something and defend himself so he went to join a boxing club. The action never stopped and it went to Alfred's problems on the streets at home and in the boxing ring and it was always interesting to see how he overcame his problems. It is a good book and never get's boring and keeps you thinking what will happened next.
4,The Contendor,"I pretty much enjoyed this book. I had to read it for school and I wasn't very excited about it. The subject matter (boxing) does not appeal to me. Besides that fact Robert Lipsyte did a very good job on this book. The Contender is the story of a young man named Alfred Brooks who is going through a very hard time in his life. He had dropped out of high school and, Alfred and his best friend are growing apart. Alfred also has to deal with living in a bad place and all the bad people around him. When there is no where else to turn Alfred decides to give boxing a try. This books main theme is how Alfred used boxing to help him through all of his troubles and how he learned to be a real ""contender"". I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys boxing and inspirational stories."
2,(...) Great and Magnificent Review,"My feelings on this book can be summed up into one word; disappointing. Throughout the story the excitement builds and builds for something great to happen, but towards the end the book the story takes a enormously horrendus fall. I feel that the ending is an inslt to the story. I was very into the story till about the 3/4's mark, then I had to force myself to read the rest. I'm dissapointed that I had. So I suggest you go buy the book read 3/4's of it, rate it, read the rest, and rate it again. More than likely, I'll bet you'll be disappointed."
3,Rocky......a different story,"Alfred brooks is a high school drop-out and a grocery store attendent.His life does not seem to be on the right track. HIs best friend has been falling deeper and deeper into a drug addiction and is sinking in life fast than Alfred. A bunch of street kids are after him fro something he never did. So he begins going to Donatelli's Gym, A boxing club that has trained many champs before. here he learns that winning is not everything but it is that you must try to succed and that effort is the most important thing, and that is what makes a manthe last struggle to get back into the fight when the rest of the world is convinced you are knocked out."
3,The Contender,"The Contender, by Rorbert Lipsyte was overall a good book. Though I would rate the book about a 3on a scale of one to five because it isn't really the kind of book that I would read and it wasn't that interesting to me. THere were some good cliff hangers that made you want to read more. Teh begginning chapters just kind of got you familiar with the book and weren't very interesting. As you got further in the pace picked up. The book also shows that you should make good desicions and don't let peer pressure push you around. Alfred, the main character, faces many sruggles throughout the book and tells how he overcomes them. The ending kind of leaves you hanging but it lets your imagination imagine what happens to Alfred and his good friend."
4,A good book,"This book is very good but the beginning and end is not that good. Once you get into it, people like it. That's probably why people cannot get into the book because the beginning is not very good. It is bad enough the start is bad, the end is horrible. They just cut off. It is talking about how Alfred will help James and then it ends. There is no outcome or anything. The middle part of the story is very good. It is about how Alfred is succeeding in his life. This story is in the time period of the 70's."
4,The Contender,The Contender is a wonderful book filled with mystery and suspense. I felt as though I was right there with Albert (the main character) through his struggles and triumphs. Through the book I felt what it was like to live during segregation and what it was like to have a friend on drugs. The Contender is a real tearjerker with real life situations. Albert trains to become a boxer with his coach Donatelli. Will he turn pro.? I recommend this book to every one who has a passion for reading.
2,Contender's review,"A story about a high-school dropout whose best friend is sinking deeper and deeper into drug adiction. Alfred Brook, the main character in this story, was determined to help his friend by becoming a contender, no, a champion boxer."
4,The Contender,"I read the Contender for Language Arts and thought I was going to dislike it because it was about boxing. However, once I started, I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. This novel for young adults addresses issues most teenagers still face today, like fitting in and finding out what you are good at. It is about a young African American, Alfred Brooks, living in Harlem in the mid sixies. He wants to countinue being friends with James, his childhood best friend, but James has gone the wrong way and started hanging out with thugs. Alfred then tries boxig. It gives him something to do and goals to set. However, staying with it, not turning down the easy (and the bad) road, and competing competitivly are all things Alfred must face. This book about a teenagers struggle is a must-read for all advanced readers."
1,The Contender,"I would not recomend this book to any young readers. It is full of racist comments and slang. Also it portrays Harlem as a extreamly bad city where murdering and robbing stores is a daily affair. Also African Americans are not all druggies, murderers and bums and or thugs. Harlem is not a top notch place to grow up but, the author didn't need to make it sound like an evil 666 place were daily Black Nationalists are held. To make the story better is to have Alfred have two brothers one of which would live and another to die... and his best friend is a talkin bluebarry pie."
4,The Contender,"Alfred's life is going nowhere fast. He's a high-school dropout working at a grocery store. His best friend is drifting behind a haze of drugs and violence, and now some street punks are harassing him for something he didn't do. Feeling powerless and afraid, Alfred decides to visit Donatelli's Gym, the neighborhood's boxing club. He wants to be a champion, on the streets and in his own life. Alfred doesn't quite understand when Mr. Donatelli tells him, ""It's the climbing that makes the man. Getting to the top is an extra reward.""In the end, he learns that a winner isn't necessarily the one standing when the fight is over. I reccomend this book to Teens and adults because they will be knocked out by this woderfull story of how a frightened boy becomes a man."
5,Best book ever!,This book is one of the greatest books I have ever read. It is great for teenagers every where. This book is great for kids to learn not to do drugs and drink achool. Alfred is the main charater in this book. He has a best friends James who always gets in trouble and does drugs. Alfred over comes all of it. I hope this book all the schools make sure that students well read this.
3,the contender,"I though the book the contender was a really inspiring book to people with low self esteam and that get picked on a lot. It talks about how people want to become someone and lifes difficulties Alfred faces. I think everyone who likes to hear about problems people face in reality and how to deal with them should read this book. This book wasnt slow to get into the story it got right to the point, in other words your not waiting your time reading it. I thought this book was a really inspiring, and it kinda gets to reality in todays world. I definally recommend this book."
4,The Contender,"The Contender was an astonishing novel that takes you to the harsh streets of Harlem. You will encounter life and death situations. Its a place you have got to fight to survive. Just like Alfred Brooks. It's the story of an eight-teen year old boy who hasn't discovered what to do with his life. He turns to boxing, a place where he has a chance, a place where he can make it."
4,The Condtender,"THE CONTENDERI think that The Contender is a great book. The Contender is a book about a young black man named Alfred who wants to be a boxer. He goes to Donatelli's gym to train and get prepared to fight. At the gym, Alfred meets some new friends. His best friend's name is James. James gets mixed up with some trouble making kids, and he gets in trouble with the police. James then becomes a boxer. I think that anybody that likes boxing should read this book. You never know what's going to happen next. I would've never guessed what happens at the end."
3,The Contender,"I would recomend this book, I think this book is highly releastic and shows just how your life can change with one good or bad choise. This book focas on a teenager highschool drop-out, Alfred,who works at a grosey store, who is trusted and respected by the owner of the store. Then one night his best friend, James, decides to go with Major and rod the store, and James is the only one to get cuoght out of him, Major and his gang. This book shows that evan if you arn't the one macking a choice that it can still affect you, good or bad. That is why I recomed this book."
3,The Contender,"I sorta liked the book, but it wasn't really what I'm into. I'm not really into boxers because you can easily get end up in thr hospital or maybe even dead. If I was him I would have not done it, it seems pretty stupid. It was very different then other books I've read. I sorta don't think people under the age of 13 should read it unless there interested in boxing. He had friends that cared for him. His best close friend was James, but the book was sorta interesting, but not to much."
4,The Contender is da bomb!,"The book The Contender was very well written. One of the main reasons I enjoyed it was because it showed that a normal person can do what they want as long as they put their mind to it. The writer keeps your interest throughout the book and keeps you waiting for what will happen next. The worst thing about this book was the ending: it could've had a better ending. Maybe end it at Donateli's gym. Besides the ending, I recommend this book to anyone who would like to read it."
5,I think that the book teaches us a good lesson.,Alfred is a high school drop out who has a grocery store job working for Jewish people. Alfred has friends that do drugs. He has people after him for something he didn't even do. Eventually he trains in Harlem for boxing where he learns to be a true man. He learns respect for others and himself.I think the book teaches us a lesson about bieng a leader and not a follower. I think the book was very well done.
3,The Contender,"THE CONTENDERThe Contender was an interesting book. I would recommend this book to people who like to read about sports and people who do things to try and help other people out with their problems. Alfred Brooks was struggling and he quit High School. Then his friend James started doing drugs so Alfred knew he had to help him. So, Alfred stared to box even though he didn't like it. After awhile of being trained, Alfred was getting better at boxing and he started to enjoy it. Even though most of his friends and family members were trying to talk him out of it he never gave up."
3,The Contender,"The ContenderI thought the book The Contender was an okay book. I thought it was a good book because I like the sport boxing, and this book is about a young boy who always wanted to become a professional boxer but had to start out as an amateur because he had never boxed in a league before and this is his opportunity to finally become a live boxer and he wasn't about to let it go. In order to become a professional boxer you need to work hard for it and that is exactly what he was trying to do, you have to work hard and run a lot of miles a day, but you have to start out slow and then work harder and harder in order to become a professional boxer. This is his dream, to become a professional boxer."
3,The Contender,"I would give this book 3 stars because it is about boxing and that does not really interest me although it was a book. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the world of boxing. This book was also very difficult for me to follow along with. The writter did not tell you who was speaking and when, you just had to guess. Also the people in the book did not talk with right grammer so it was had to know what they were trying to say. All in all it was an ok book."
4,The Contender,"From a high school dropout, to a talented boxer, Alfred Brooks goes through the hardships of being African-American in the 1960's on the streets of Harlem. ""He puts the sport in the right perspective,"" as others have said. While training to become a boxer he is tempted with drugs, alchol, and gang activity. This book not only teaches you about boxing, but also teaches about friendship, hardships, and African-American's during this time. This book is very realistic and makes you think of this time period when blacks were discriminated. This is a great read for the young adult because it is so realistic. You also don't have to be interested in sports at all to really get ""into"" this book. Its one of my favoritebooks I've ever read ( but that's not sayin' much )."
4,The Contender,"The Contender is and okay book. Alfred has to make lots of decisions. He doesn't always make the best decision. He also has to deal with troublesome people like Major and his friends. Mr. Lipsyte creates a vivid description the entire book. I felt like I was with Albert the entire time. The beginning is boring at first, and the ending leaves you kind of hanging. The overall story is pretty good, however. I got so hooked on it, I couldn't stop reading until the end. This book is why I gave it a four."
3,The Contender,"The Contender is a good book and part funny. This is a good book to read for boxing. And if you don't read this, you must be crazy or out of your mind. Yes, I like the book, but they just need to make the Contender Part II. What really happens at the end? Does Alfred win more fights? Will Alfred help his friend get off drugs? Will ALfred become the champion of the world?"
3,The Contender,"The Contender is a book about boxing that seems it will never end because you don't want it to. It is one of those books that the plot is not very good but the way the author puts the words together makes you want to read on. I do not enjoy boxing at all so that may be the reason I did not enjoy the book.Lipsyte brings the characters to life as you are reading and you can imagine the problems the characters are going through. He is a great author.The Contender takes place in Harlem when racism was a problem. Alfred, an African American, wants to become a boxer to make his friend James proud so he will stop doing drugs. The plot is not very intriguing but with Lipsyte's style it is interesting. If you like boxing I recommend it!"
3,The Contender review,"This story is about a high school dropout named Alfred, whoboxes to help his friend James, who is hooked on drugs. He worksfor a supermarket, which his friend James always tries to rob.So he begins to box at Donatelli's gym. That's where Alfredlearns what hard work and dedication is. His family doesn't wanthim to box, but Alfred doesn't quit. Throughout the book Alfredhas to deal with pure pressure, and getting beat up all the time.But in the end it makes him a stronger person."
2,Contender Review,"Alred is a grungy boy with no life. He seems to be a loser since he droped out of school and now has to work at a grocery store. My opinion of The Contender was not that good. I did not enjoy it that much. You may think diffrent because your a diffrent person but if your like me then you wont!They kept seeming to mention the black people are all ghetto and thats not true. Yea, some black people may be ghetto but they have no right to say that all black people are. I thought the only good part it is that it gives hope and encouragement that no matter what you go through as a child or during you life, you will always do anything you put your heart to. Thats just my opinion."
2,It is not a 4 star or 3 star book,"...I believe that the book is a really bad book. I think that it is WAY to slow, and that it is not selfdirected. There are some parts that don't even make sense. It is in my worst book list."
2,A kid's Review,I am a kid in 8th grade and personally i thought this was the WORST BOOK I HAD EVER READ! we read this book as a reading assignment in class and i HATED it! it was too boring and drawn out. The plot in my opinion was one to look forward to. but i kinda hoped that It would be a bit more....interesting!if you are the type of person that like more meaningfull and better written books don't read this...!
1,being a contender,For one reason I liked this book was because the boy was apart of some sort of gang and then decides to try out boxing. The people at the gym say if he wants to be a good boxer then he has to eat little but no too little also he has to run every day in the morning and also go to bed at a reasonable time. And then the man said that if you want to be a champion then you first have to be a contender. A contender is a person that does not think he will win that should be a good life lesson for him. And then after that he starts to fight and then you will have to see for your self about what happens. So I think if you like books about fighting then this is a book for you. I personally didn't like this book because I don't like boxing at all and or fighting so this was not a good book for me. But it did have some good life lessons in this book. So if you like books about life lessons boxing and fighting then this is a book for you.
2,slow read,"Although my 13 year old son is not an avid reader, he does not seem to find this book interesting. It is taking forever to finish..."

So if you like books about life lessons
1,CONTENDER,Contender was not my favorite book. The reason I didn't likeit is because I thought it was stupid. If there had been moreaction it would have got my interest a little better. Like if Alfred would have beat one of his opponents so bad that he had to go the hospital. Personally I thought the book was stupid.
3,This book is awkward,"This book is pretty good. It's about a a boy named Alfred Brooks who has dropped out of school and is working in a grocery store. He takes up boxing for something to do, to be good at after his best friend, James, dumps him for some new friends. While the book has a good plot, it just doesn't flow together. There are some awkward pauses where it jumps from one thing to the next with no explanation. The friendship between Alfred and James is important to the book, but not well defined, making it hard to have sympathy for James or to understand why Alfred still wants to be his friend after James dumps him. All in all, this book is pretty okay."
5,I like the fact that we see what Alfred is thinking.,"This book is fantastic. I don't mean to sound rascist but it is amazing how a white middle aged guy can understand the feelings of a young black male growing up under trying circumstances. Kudos to Robert Lipsyte. I recommend this book whole heartedly to all. Young, Old black white.... Black males who are coming of age can definately relate to this book. Also reccomended. Where do I go from here ? by Valerie Wesley"
3,The Contender,"I thought this book was decent. It was not that exciting at the beginning, but at about the eight chapter it started to get interesting. Alfred alawys gets picked on buy this big guy named Major. He starts going to the gym and becomes a great boxer. If you liked the movie Rocky then I think this book would be good for you."
4,holy poop this is a good book by scubasteve!!!,this is a great book. i dont usually read and i dont like to but i enjoyed this book so if you dont like to read like me i suggest you get this book.this is one of those books where you can read it over and over again and never get sick of it. if you buy this book i know that you will be satisfied and that hopfuly you will enjoy this book as much as i do cause this book is wicked hardcore!!!and kinda pimp ~~~scubasteve
3,This book is ok...,"The book the Contender was considerably well-written, but Robert Lipsyte's style isn't my favorite. Boxing fans would probably enjoy this book,but I'm not into boxing. This book is probably more for boys. The ending wasn't great-I expected more. However, a good point of the book was the well-developed characters. I enjoyed reading about Alfred, Major, James, and Henry. It was interesting to watch Alfred throgh his struggle to be a contender.(and stay out of trouble)"
5,This was one of the best books I have ever read! (**),I thought this book was really good. I have only read a few books that I have liked. This book was so good because this could actually be a real 17 year old that I know. Even though it was written in 1976. It develops a real good picture in your mind especially during his fights. After I finished the book I wanted to know if there was a sequel. So read this book!
3,The Contender,"I thought the book,The Contender,was a fun a fun book to read in your spare time. I liked the beginning part because I thought it would be funny to see the faces on Major's face when he heard that Alfred was training to be a chapion of the world. But after awhile in his training he quits boxing because Mr. Donatelli tells him he doesn't have the ""killer instinct"". Also he felt bad for the other person. I think you should read the book,The Contender, because it shows someone who dropped out of school do something good with his life."
3,The Contender,"I thought the book was okay. I liked the dramatization. The book was a little boring in the beginning but it got better in the end. I would summarize it as a boy with courage who stood up for himself. I would reccomend it to anyone who likes drama and sad stories. Alfred was willing to become a boxer but he quit. Because Donatelli his boxing manager tells him he doesn't have ""killer instinct"". James was Alfreds friend but he started using drugs badly. In the end James and Alfred become best friends."
4,The Contender,"Afred is a typical Harlem boy. He lives with his Aunt Pearl and her three daughters. Alred goes through many obsticles in his life and thinks he can handle anything until his best friend begins getting involved with the cops and donig illegal things. When that starts to happen, Alred all of a sudden has no where to go, then when he finds Donatelli's Gym, the neighborhood boxing gym, he begins to wonder what it would be like if he could finally do something with his life. Read this story to find out if Alred decides to become a Contender and succeed in life, or stay an average New Yorker."
3,The Contender,"I liked the book The Contender by Robert Lipsyte. It teaches you a lot about life. One thing it teaches you is that even if you grow up in a poor part of town and have hada not so good life, you can grow up to be anything you want to be, as long as ou try. One good way to do this is by starting a sport. Alfred Brooks, the main character, is growing up with his aunt and two cousins in a very poor city. He decides to start boxing so he can defend himself and do something with him life. It helped him a lot and got him a new and better life. He fought in a couple of matches, but then something bad happened-read the book to find out. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes boxing, it's very good."
3,The Contender,"I thought that the book was good, but it did not have enough action in it. For a boxing book it went slow and they strayed too much away from the topic. If you like boxing movies you would like the book."
4,Whoa,The Bookl the contender has a lot of lessons and morals that youmg adults can learn from peer pressure to drugs and alchohol. Alfred is a high school dropout in which has a freind named james that robs the grocery store that alfred works at and the local bullies think that alfred ratted on them when the cops busted him when there was actually a silent alarm. Alfred is then beat up for something that he didnt even do. he is finally is sick of all of it and goes to the local boxing club and starts working out. at first Alfred wants to be champion but the owner of the gym donatelli tells Alfred to be champion you must first be a contender. Does Alfred be come a champ well you tell me after you read the book and find out for your self
3,cool book,"I thought the book wounld not be as good as it was. I thought the book showed who work work can really payoof in the end. The book started with a boy named Alfred ,at lived in Harlem, who goes to the movies with his friend James every friday night. His friend do not come so he went to find him. some boys James hang around was going to rob the store at Alfred worked at. Alfred was brave enough to tell the police about it. That is why I think that it shows what it shows in his character."
3,The Contender(its ok),"The Contender is a ok book. It is set in Harlem, New York where there are many druggies and gangs. The book is about a boy named Alfred who wants to become a boxer. So he exercises, eats right, and trains everyday to be a contender. Alfred lives with his aunt who has three daughters of her own. The book is very loyal to Harlem's factual background, by being a horrible place to grow up, or even live. But the book is very suspenseful; you never know where the story is going to go next."
3,Interesting,"The book the Contender was interesting, and that is just about it. The main character wasn't really a good role model for young children. This book was aimed for younger readers, yet it deals with issues like drugs and alcohol. I don't know what Robert Lysite was thinking when he wrote this book. If it weren't for the great boxing theme, I would have given the book 1 star. The boxing was really exciting because it told in-depth information on what happened inside the ring. I didn't know a lot about boxing before I read this book, I thought that you just hit someone until they where tired. Funny, huh? I now know a lot about boxing and am glad that I do. So, for all you boxing fans out there, you should read this book. For the rest of you, put it on the bottom of your books to read list."
3,Lashanecie's Review,"The Contender is a good story because real life is really like this. Alfred tries to avoid crime. He has been offered drugs, but he makes good decisions. You see how Alfred quits school. Some kids don't make it. They might become bums or crackheads. Alfred is lucky and goes to the right place at the right time."
2,The Review to the Contender,"I think this book was OK, but the ending was trashy and it needed more help. I think that if it had more action, the book would be great. Mostly,I liked this book. I think there should have had some more to it though. It would still have been a good book if Hollis and the gang tried to jump Alfred again or if Alfred would have punched James over the money. More action."
3,The Contender (Review),"I think the contender is a good book i wouldn't call it the best book but if you like Action, gangsters, fighting and curiosity you'll like this book! I think this book was alright I don't really like boxing so I don't have many opinions. I think the whole point of this book is not to let you or your friends get caught up with the wrong people. Don't take drugs or smoke because then you'll messup your life forever! I think if you have a really good friend you'll have a good life! That's why I rated book a #3. Because I think this book could have been better if it had more exciting parts."
4,this is the book that i am writing on,The reason why i am writing about this book is becuase i like it. it is called th contender and its about boxing. this book got my atention becuase i like boxing and i am going to be a boxer when i grow up. i wanted to read this book so it could tell me how exciting the fights are. this is why i am writing about this book.
3,"Cute Book for the Very Young - a review of ""Frozen Noses""","The verse in this book is not all that great (see example below), but it does cover the essentials of a snowy winter with colorful cut paper pictures. Children bundle up, make and throw snowballs, make a snowman, sled (no helmets), ice skate, fall down (a lot :) and then have cocoa and a nap (wahoo!).Text example for your perusal:Lace my skates upTie them tightlyReady, steadyI won't fallSlide, collideGet good at glidingHit a skidWhoops! All a-sprawl!Three Stars [C+]. The colorful artwork is the best part of this book. The text is okay and would be a nice book to snuggle down with on a frosty, snowy day. Age range: four and under."
4,Decent winter fare,"""Frozen Noses"" features beautiful opaque cut-paper pictures of multiethnic children and their dog frolicking in the snow. The plot is simple but pleasing for preschoolers - the kids bundle up, go out, make a snowman, sled, skate, fall down, and come back in to get warm. The story is told in curt rhyming verses, that sometimes strain a bit in ways that small kids won't understand (a hat is a ""proper topper,"" for example), but the main pleasure of this book is its visual aspect. Good winter fun."
2,Bogus Imports,"I gave this album 2 stars due to the fact it is Kansas music, or at least one can only hope that that is what is contained on this disc. DID ANY ONE EVER NOTICE THAT THE PHOTO ON THE ALBUM IS OF THE EDGAR WINTER BAND AND NOT KANSAS! These kind of oversights from collections like this make me want to puke. I seriously doubt that the members of Kansas are even aware of this CDs existence, much less making any money off it!"
1,"Mate, more than an acquired taste","I have had mate in South America, the gourds packed full of leaves, but this was my first trial in the US. I had hoped that the milder tea bag version might warrant reconsideration, but mate is really just horrible stuff. Both my husband and I describe the taste as dirty and pungent. Guayaki's flavored mate's warrant some consideration if you want the health benefits, but I would stay away from the original unless you really are a mate fan."
2,meh.....,This tea isn't too bad ... it tastes a little bit like hay. The stuff I've gotten in the local Espresso Royale puts this tea to shame. This could be a more traditional/real deal tea but I wouldn't know. It just tastes a little bit off.
1,overpriced,"This exact product is available at my discount health food store for half this price, which indicates that this seller may need to ""sharpen their pencil"". Just a word for the budget-minded."
5,way cool,"This stuff is pretyt nice. I tried to kick coffee with it, but I decided I like coffee too much. The ""jolt"" is real deal though. I loke this stuff. I toss it in with some Rooibos and go to work and I have a really nice ""boost"" that is very noticable. Not in a jittery caffinated way either."
2,"Great Tea, but not a great price.","This is an awesome tea, but I found it much cheaper at my local organic grocery. Order here if you need it and don't have time to run to the store, otherwise, stock up when you go to the grocery."
3,It's OK,"I was expecting the kind of Yerba Mate that when you drink it you feel like you could kill a polar bear with your ""bear"" hands (get it?)! This didn't pack the energizing punch I had with other yerba mate teas, nor some of the other delightful effects. It was in easy to use tea bags, which was handy dandy."
2,Lies,I was told this tea would make me lose weight. It didn't. I'm not sure if the tea is actually to blame. I only drank it once (I don't like tea) and I eat a pretty significant amount of candy.
5,Its definitely an acquired taste,"""Smokey"" is a good description, I would go with root-like or woody... kinda like thai tea, for anyone who's tried that. Even so, I thought it was great and conveniently wrapped. I like the tea bag style and the bag lasts me longer then I originally expected. Also, this company, which is grass-roots, no pun intended, truly seems to walk the walk when it comes to environmental issues (11th Hour anyone?) - as such, I would whole-heartedly support them, their products and the communities they serve."
1,$ave Your Money!!,"I mistakenly ordered this from this vendor, much to my chagrin. Admittedly, I was very excited about starting Yerba Mate and was a bit impulsive. I thought that I could trust Amazon to protect us from vendors who were out to rape and pillage their customer base. Not so!!! I just found this identical item at Traders Joe's for $4.99!!!! I better smoke a cigarette, because I've just been screwed!!!"
2,Go for unsmoked mate instead,"I totally love Yerba Mate. Too much probably. But some studies have shown that there is a connection between regular mate use and several types of cancers. Another study found that mate has high concentrations of molecules associated with smoke that are known carcinogens. Inference: it's most likely the smoking process that causes mate to be carcinogenic. I know the smoked version takes better, but the unsmoked version ain't bad at all if you like the mate taste. So do yourself a favor and find an unsmoked mate (I don't want to advertise --they're easy enough to find). After a couple of pounds of unsmoked mate, you won't miss it. But to be more safe, alternate mate with strong green tea like I do."
3,Strong Influence on fledgling Christian,"From political opinion to personal anecdote, this book is an interesting read. True to its title, the intellectual level is not real high, and, as pointed out by the other reviews, the correctness of doctrine is not its strong point. However, it is worth a read. I found the story about Jesus taking the place of the man condemned to die -- a parable on Jesus dying in our place, taking the penalty for something he didn't do -- to be touching and moving. I found Jess Moody's admonition to ""Do something, even if it is to flush the unflushed urinal beside you"" to be a pragmatic suggestion of starting somewhere to have a positive influence on your world. I found the suggetion (or hope) of the Becky Kopecky story to be that the first people Jesus is going to bust when he returns are the drug pushers to be a strong warning against abusing others or ruining each other."
3,Good Book That Should Be Enlarged,"... This one is for sure a very good book on poppulation biology. However, we see at once that the part devoted to population genetics is very short indeed, if it is compared to the other part that treats about population ecology. In this way, it is my firm idea that the part on population genetics should be well enlarged. Only in this way, could we talk on a book about population biology. The way it is in fact written we could say that it is a book on population ecology, rather than on population biology. I recommend that on a future edition, Professor Hastings should dedicate about the same number of pages to both parts. The way this author writes, it will ensure a very large public acceptance."
5,Perfect for RV use,"I use this small popup container as a recyling bin in the RV, all bottles, cans etc. go in it. Perfect size to stick in a corner and not take up too much room."
5,Very handy,I keep of these in every vehicle I own. Perfect size and keeps me from using my floor as a trash can.
5,Love this!,"This collapsable trash can is perfect for the car and makes for easy clean up. I hate having papers and other trash cluttering up my car, so this item really does the trick. It's a perfect size, too. I bought the smaller size first, and it wound up being way too small. This one is perfect! It's easy to clean, too, in case of any spills."
2,world's worst horror movie ?,"The most hardcore bad film buff will be surprised by the overall ineptness of this grade-z ""film"". The acting is mostly horrid, the plot is pretty lame, and the ending is pathetic. Yet...it does have a certain charm about it, it's almost so bad that it's kinda good. It's at times more of a comedy than a horror movie, just listen to some of the lines and sound effects. It reminded me a lot at times of the comedy/horror spoof movie ""Student Bodies"". I like the early electronica music that runs throughout the film, it's repetitive but effective, I would compare it as very similar to the music from the first ""Slumber Party Massacre"" film.I think if the killings would have been a little more realistic and unique, and that if the ending would have been a lot better and explained things this could have been a more highly regarded film. It would have also helped if the movie was about 10 minutes longer in length, 75 minutes did seem quite short watching it."
1,minirus tapes are worthless,the books come with four tapes. You must listen to all four tapes in one sitting. Once you stop the tapes and try to find where you left off your done. You will probably have to start all over again from the beginning. There is no reference in the books as to which tape or even which side of the tape you need. The tapes have a hint of reference but it is not helpful at the least.
1,Deception,"Do NOT be deceived by the title. The product you get is NOT made by Sima. It's actually done by Adorama. And here are the differences: (i) string is not as long as the original Sima piece (ii) instead of providing a solid disc at one end, the disc is actually covered by a sticker (iii) the sticker is hardly sticky. The general build is much poorer than the same thing from Sima.Do not be cheated by Adorama. In fact, it's better to buy from B&H; than Adorama."
2,you will not be shipped a Sima product,"I ordered this and received 3 separately packaged Bower cap keepers, rather than a Sima three-pack. Shop elsewhere if you're looking for the Sima product specifically."
2,Cheap = ?Quality,The product quality is not high. Bur since i bought many of them at the same time i was able to choose the best 3 for my lens covers. i don't recommend since the quality is not acceptable.
5,This album is awesome,"Warsawpack's music is impossible to categorize. They mix together jazz, hip-hop, funk and rock in a way that really works. The lyrics are carefully thought out, and are pretty amazing to listen to. This is the type of music where you can enjoy it by either listening to the exact lyrics coming out of lead singer Lee Raback's mouth, or just listen to the melody. It would be a favour for yourself to buy this album."
5,Comfortable shoe,Mephisto again lives up to its reputation for comfortable shoes. I love this Elka sandal and will wear it often.
3,Good debut effort!,"Decent debut effort from this soap opera actor. Eduardo Palomo's MOVER EL TIEMPO album from 1994 is a blend of pop and rock tunes sung in spanish sure to lift your spirits, especially the upbeat song LAS CUENTAS CLARAS. Overall, a good album, in my opinion."
5,One of the best musically directed orchestrations ever.,"This recording is a masterpiece. You will be brought right back to the glory day era of ""special musicals"" in time. This is one that should not be missed. The original musical lasted a incredible 588 performance from 1953-1955 at the Ziegfeld theatre in NY. It is right up there with the top musicals of all time. The musical direction & condution is if not the best ever. Louis Adrian won the Tony Award for musical direction/conduction for Kismet in 1954. http://www.ibdb.com/awardperson.asp?id=97747This is the same man who conducted the ""orignal"" Peter Pan and a host of others. Adrian during the period was one of if not one the biggest musical talents of the era inside the musical world. Couple that with the incredible melodies and lyrics of Borodin you have one incredible performance.Once you listen to it you will understand."
3,Picture is wrong,"the written description is correct but the picture is wrong causing me to order the wrong product, is two wire not four but heavy duty"
4,"good info, a bit disjointed","Compelling information, good talking head documentary. The format is choppy, and could have a more developed story line. Hopeful and upbeat, with good examples of how the standard american diet degrades our population and environment, and how the change to a plant-based diet creates sustainability, and health."
2,nothing but an infomercial,"I was so disappointed with this DVD. It featured all of my heros - John McDougall, John Robbins, Joel Furhman and Dr Esselstyn, but the program was so choppy - I kept wondering when the intro would be over and the program begin. Admittedly, I've been following these folks for years, but I did expect some aha! moment. If it wasn't for the individual interviews at the end, this DVD wouldn't even have rated one star. I would definately recommend Dr McDougall's lecture series instead. Now there's content!"
4,Great DVD,This documentary is very informative. It features a variety of qualified health professionals to discuss each health topic. You are able to shorten it into smaller segments for shorter time periods and still not miss any of its important emphasis on the hazards of processed foods.
1,No! No! No!,"Watch out...this is not a modern book.It is a Dover reprint of an Egyptian grammar published in 1920. If you are interested in the Egyptian language and script, don't waste your money.I'd recommend either Collier and Manley's ""How to Read Egyptian Hieroglyphs"" ,or Allen's ""Middle Egyptian"". Check the reviews for these 2 books, and decide which best suits your goal."
4,Very useful for a woodworker!,"Pretty simple concept -- two clamps, one clamps the unit onto your work bench, the other clamps your work piece(s). Excellent quality of workmanship. Once you get the hang of it, opening and locking the jaws are real easy. Only complaint is that I wish the work piece jaws are taller (or maybe larger jaw fit-ons), so it would grip face frames better."
3,Interesting,I was hoping for a book of her costumes throughout the ages but it really didn't have the evolutionary pictures I was looking for. It is a good book of her history overall.
1,Perhaps 1 1/2,I have read a few of her books and enjoyed them but this one was a disappointment. The abrupt ending and acceptance of all just didn't sit with me. I never really got to like Derrik.
2,Don't know what to think,This is my third JL book and I don't know what to think. I didn't like the fact the two main characters meet on page 141 in one scene. I read up to 171 and the characters hadn't met since page 141. There was too much plot and very little romance. JL describes her characters and settings very descriptively and it comes alive but I guess I just got bored waiting for the action to happen. I stopped reading halfway through the book because I have about 4 more novels I'm dying to read (some by JL) so in the future I might give this one a try again.
2,Mental / Emotional Rape = Love,"I loved the first 150 pages of this book. The characters were fun and the settings were interesting. Everything was great until the hero and heroine met. Then the whole book went south.The Rest of the book is about Derek's desire to have sex with Chantelle. And the sex is his only desire. He doesn't know anything about her and doesn't seem to care. He never even asks what her real name is, although he insists that she use his real name. He's manipulative, selfish, and pretty much 'seduces' her into the sex. (Where I come from that's called emotional rape.) I ended up hating him, and not understanding why she loved him. Frankly, I thought Chantelle would have been better off with one of the eunuchs.But of course he falls in love with her (falls in love with having sex, because they never have a conversation about anything else. How can you love a complete stranger?) and it all works out. Blah. I won't make the mistake of reading another Johanna Lindsey book."
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!,"Johanna Lindsey is my favorite author, and this book is my ultimate favorite. The intrigue is so well intertwined with the romance, it's like two books in one. I could picture the scenes and felt a part of history as I read this story. I have read it several times, and will read it again. It's FABULOUS!!!"
3,A book for all Romance lovers!,"I usually don't like romance books that have harlems in them, but this book was an exceptional book. I could not put it down."
1,It sux big time!,I'm really very sorry to say this 'cuz i really love all of JL's books but this one was pretty pathetic. The heroine Chantelle was so yucky..... and Mega STUPID and the whole harem setting was gross to be verrrry honest!Oh and yeah the ending also sucked! sorry but i expect better from JL!
4,Harem Intrigue,"Orphaned Chantelle watches her distant relatives squanders the fortune left to her that she can not touch until she is married. Desperate, she flees only to be kidnapped by barbary pirates. Derek Sinclair has received a secret message from his twin brother Jamil, the Dey of Barikah. Upon his arrival, he is asked to take the Dey's place while an assassin is being hunted down. As a gift Jamil buys Derek his own woman to use while he is gone. Chantelle is that woman. Angry and frightened, she longs for her home in England and fights her captivity. Then she is summoned by the Dey and to her shock the man begins to court her. What will happen when she learns the truth?Chantelle is stunningly beautiful, but perhaps too willful and full of pride. At first I was amused by her fury, then I was thinking ""enough! Let's get too the good stuff."" Derek is wonderful, patient, kind, and downright seductive. A few times I thought he was more than she deserved, but overall I enjoyed this story."
2,Where is the ending?,"The first problem with the book came with the two main characters. They did not meet until half way into the book!!! However, when they were together there was the usual passion that Lindsey is known for. Unfortunately, she drops the ball again with the conclusion of the book. Lindsey leaves about ten unanswered questions. Furthermore, the heroine acts uncharacteristically at the end. After turning the last page, the reader will be immensely disappointed. I do not recommend this book. Lindsey needs to rewrite the ending and answer the questions she left hanging."
4,I liked it,"I read pther reviews before actually reading the book so I came into it thinking that the book would be a bad read but really it was pretty okay. I was expecting not to like Derek but I changed my mind about that as well. Chantelle was a hellcat that's for sure but she was a pretty good heroine. The plot, with the killer and all, could have been a little more intricate but I won't way how without giving away the book's ending to potential readers. Other wise it was a good book. Surely better than Captive Bride."
5,SUPERB,"I highly recommend this book if you like a well rounded book. It is slam packed with action, romance, deceit, and suspense. It is definitley one that will keep you sitting on the edge of your seat. It is very hard to put down once you start reading it. You will be waiting for the next one to publish once you finish this book."
4,"Easy install and great product, but diferent then the picture","I bought this for my '72 Chevy Blazer, opened it up and it didn't look anything like the picture. I was getting ready to send it back but looked at all the connections and they matched the OEM part. Truthfully I just bought this for the cover because mine had came loose while off-road and was lost. I'd already searched the local junkyards so I decided to put this one on. It took less then 45 minutes and took it for a ride and didn't even end up bleading the breaks. The one I received is more oval shaped with a bail retainer over each resivour. It's much more secure them the OEM retainer; I actually need to use a flat head to pry the bails open. Just lost a star because it's not the one in the pic and I had to replace the whole thing."
3,Thers's a stranger in my house,"The story line was very weak and didn't make much sense to me (the mom kick's husband out because he is not there for her or her daughter, yet once he is gone the mom pays no attention to her child and suddenly she's whorish, too silly for me)only because of this I didn't enjoy the play, had there been a logical plot it would have been great."
1,Save your money.,This play is terrible.It's all over the place one minute the girl is talking about Jesus then the next she trying to sleep with someone.This play is terrible trust me save your money and spend it on something else!!!
1,Horrible,This play had me so confused... What was the writer thinking it had no substance it was horrible could not sit and watch overally dramatic which made it horrible
2,Low grade trite play,"I saw this after ""Whatever she wants"" with Vivica Fox, so I thought it would be worth my while to watch. Boy, was I wrong. The plot is very scattered, including bringing in random characters that were not properly introduced into the setting. What made me really upset is the part when she dressed like some 50 cent peep show into her job and acted as if the way she dressed would get a fair reaction from her chavinistic boss. (Shakes head). Plus, some singing was not necessary and the way it ended was just not right, certainly a cliffhanger. Do not waste your money on buying this because it is not worth the money or possibly your time."
2,Could use some work,"Steven Dick covers a lot of interesting material in a variety of fields. However, the author has a tendency to write extensively in the passive voice, making it very slow reading. He also has a tendency to drop lots of names at once. This makes it extremely difficult to follow at times."
4,Good book for the History buff,This book covers topics during the WWII period with lots of historical info. Was able to find using the serial # of my Garand (Springfield) that it was made in the early part of 1945.
1,Pretty bad transfer to CD,"I found this CD after looking for ""replacements"" for the vinyl LP I have of this recording (excluding the ""Apres midi..."") Bad choice. The CD sounds as if the music has been flattened with a steam roller. All the nuances, dynamic range, warmth, resonance, overtones, subtlety, smokiness, shimmering elegance, etc etc have all been lost. The CD sounds like computer-generated rubbish. I made sure of my impression by listening to my LP vs this CD one after the other, several times. NOT RECOMMENDED. Pity, as I think the **LP recording** of the flute, alto & harp sonata is one of the most transcendent pieces of music I have heard."
4,wagner L609 mm .,I've owned the wagner moisture meter for about 6 months now and i can say that its a very important tool to have if working with your own sawn lumber. The pinless design is great. The first step to getting a acurate reading is to plane the board smooth. This way the meter comes in contact with the wood completely. The conversion chart is very handy. I rate this item a 4 because how well does it accually work?
2,A novel on Ataturk,"If you want to have a less fantasized and a more detailed biography of Ataturk, you should read Patrick Kinross or Andrew Mango. This book is close to fiction than to history. Some parts are exagerated to create a tension and a push to read the text. Moreover the narrative usually does not give any clue why he moved in a certain way. During the book the plot is more important than the information. If you are distant to the history of Ottoman Empire or Turkey, you may easily adopt an unrealistic view."
1,grey wolf from a turkish citizen,"he wasn't a dictator. furthermore in turkey many people still fall in love with him as Latife Mustafa Kemal, as our grandmothers And no one from the other countries can really understand what Atatürk means for us and for us. No one really understand becouse no one has such a long an diffucult war period for indepence. The only true thing is he is a real hero!!!"
3,Half of the CD was interviews,"I got this CD for my mom. She was disappointed that half of the CD was interviews, not music."
5,Vern Gosdin,This is the first album I ever bought of Vern Gosdin. It is a great compilation of his best music. Reminds me of Earl Thomas Connaly.
3,not the best,this album has only a few classics by Vern. The interview on the album makes up half of the track list
5,GREAT!,"I love the original version better then the US version, and they didn't edit anything out. The sub are kind of off, I know few Japanese, that's why I know, but it's correct by what they are talking about, and the DVD only contains 3 episodes, But overall I love the DVD. I hope they make more DVD coming Out! ^_^"
4,A must-read - all the best and worst parts of American culture as seen by one religious sect,"If you were going to read just ONE of Walter Kirn's books, this would be the one I'd recommend. It is my absolute favorite, as it seems to be written from the heart and clearly shows that Kirn is familiar with both the advantages and disadvantages of religious commitment - including protection from the worst aspects of American materialism to alienation from the larger culture. Using a small religious sect as his focus, Kirn manages to reflect our world in high contrast.Not only that, but the book is a wild and vibrant ride, as memeber of the Aboriginal Fulfilled Aposles set out to find converts for their group, a group which is in danger of extinction. Along the way, they bump up against wealthy Americans, drug dealers, Wiccans and others....and somehow it all works, making the reader see our culture with new eyes."
4,"Accurate, cutting satire",Well written farce. Kirn truly understands the ridiculousness found in the Rocky Mountain West. Well worth the read.
5,Hi-larious!,"A truly top-notch novel by Walter Kirn, possibly his best, that explores the emptiness and tackiness of American culture and society (I know, it's shooting fish in a barrel). It is, I think, pretty much a textbook picaresque novel, and although similar themes have been explored in other works, they've never been developed so freshly and to such humorous effect..."
2,"Not complete, nor even division","Product received was 9ft and 14ft length cord, yes 25ft total, the listing made no mention that the cord would be divided. I expected a continuous piece from which I could divide to suit my needs. This seems to be a running theme in this company's business practice. Amazon are you listening?"
5,Exercise tubing,"This is great tubing - what i especially like is you can make your own lengths of bands. Combine this with the Theraband handles and your all set!!! In addition, they last forever."
5,Perfect Band,Just what I needed. It's strong and lasting. I'm over 200lbs. and using it for 2 or 3 different exercises. You get plenty so I have some at work and for home.
4,good for the practice tests,"This book is great for the practice tests it provides, and I recommend it for anyone who is practicing for the GRE. However, I think it is important to look at some of the other books out there as well. Some will be stronger in explaining the answers, but may have less practice tests, or other deficiencies. I don't know of one absolute best source to recommend to you, and I doubt that there is one. It depends so much on exactly what you need the practice on. This book is great for general review and practice, and it can help you to identify the areas that you really need to work on. Based on that you may be able to identify what other books or material could be helpful in getting ready for the test."
2,This book should have been tested.,"I selected this book from the glut of GRE preparation manuals based on two factors--the lower price and its five model tests. My thinking was the more times I practiced taking the test, the better. While I certainly can't hold this book accountable for my performance or my score, I can caution potential test-takers that this book seems a little incomplete. There are areas in the math portion where items are left blank. For one of the passages in the reading comprehension section, the question asked about an author never even mentioned in the text! These sloppy details don't cancel out the whole of the book, but they are distracting. When you are preparing to take the GRE, do you really want to worry about your test-prep book being wrong or incomplete?"
5,Good refresher,This book definately serves its purpose. If you need a good review on math and vocab this book can help. Also the tips on answering questions are extremely useful. I wouldn't use this as my only tool before taking the GRE but it is a huge help.
2,Great price but not so great book.,"The Verbal and Analytical Sections of the book contain general tactics and strategies that are helpful. However, you still need to polish up on your vocabulary to actually answer the questions, and practise writing essays and identifying issues, etc. The 3500 Master Word list is helpful but some definitions of some words are inaccurate. I had to double-check with a proper dictionary! The Math review section and practice exercises seem to be incomplete in some areas - No answer choices (A, B, C, D, or E) were given, so you don't really know what the actual answer is other than the letters A, B, C, D or E! The Math Review section is a tad bit cluttered and not as concise or simple as I'd like it to be. I have not done high-school math for 15 years and really need a refresher course that I thought this book would provide, which it did not. I regret having bought this book."
4,Fast learning,the high-frequency word list is on target with what the GRE asks and mastering the Barron's MATH problems will guarantee u an 800.
4,A review of Barron's How to prepare for the GRE.,The book is carefully written with the test taker in mind.I found the exmples very elaborate and self-explanatory for the average test taker to understand.There are sample test questions at the end of each chapter which for me was very helpful in my preparation for the test.The sample questions mirror the actual test questions so well that the test taker who spends time workimg through them will doubtless leave the testing centre smiling broadly.
3,Great toy that keeps infant occupied!,"This is the first Lamaze toy we owned, but certainly won't be the last. This is a great infant toy. I received this for my third child. He was a month old when we received it. He was immediately drawn to the bright colors. He is now 5 months old and is still interested in it, in fact he never puts it down. As soon as he was able to reach out and grab it he did. He loves the softness of the fabric and nuzzles it to nap. He is especially fond of the teethers at the end of the arms, they must sooth those itchy gums. The little squeaker and rattle on the other arms get a giggle out of him everytime. This toy also features crinkle sounds. He loves this toy so much that we attached it to his carseat. It keeps him entertained for long periods of time. The best part is it is machine washable, just place in a pillowcase first, then throw in the wash and comes out like new again. I highly reccomend it! Makes a great gift!!"
4,Makes my 3 month old giggle,This toy makes my three month old laugh out loud when I shake it in front of her. She is also learning to grap onto things so this is the perfect toy for that. We take it everywhere.
5,The Best !,"My 3 month old daughter absolutely loves Celeste. She laughs at it, tries to eat it and is just totally in love with this toy. There are so many things to look at and touch. Best thing I've bought for her so far."
4,Her favorite toy,"My daughter is now 6 months old and she still loves this toy. I got it for her when she was about a month. We take it with us wherever we go and it always seems to calm her. It is soft enough to be comforting, yet there are many toys that she can play with. All of our friends babies seem to love it too, it is hard to keep it out of their hands. I also have had no problem washing it."
5,Learn While Playing,My great granddaughter was 5 months old when she got this toy. She plays with it a lot - there are so many different things she can do with it. Her mother has been surprised at the amount of time the baby spends with the toy.
1,Strangulation hazard for babies learning to roll over . . .,"My four month old son was playing with his favorite toy Celeste and practicing his new roll-over skills when the toy became wrapped around his neck. My husband was nearby and remove the toy before our son was strangled to death. We returned Celeste to Learning Curve (the maker of Lamaze toys) and cited the incident and their ""guarantee for life."" Two months later we have not received a response from them. Additionally, this incident was reported to the CPSC (Consumer Product Safety Commission)"
3,You are my sunshine,When my son was less than 3 months old we got this for him and suspended it from the light above our kitchen table. He would sit in his bouncy chair and we would watch him smile and coo at Celeste. He loved it. Now that he is 11 months old he drags it around with him and makes the squeaker squeak. Awesome toy for developing dexterity.
5,Wonderful first toy!,"I bought Celeste for my son when he was 2 months old and he has loved it since day one! The smile on the sun, crinkly handle, squeaker, and teething attachments all entertain him. Even now at 6 months old, Celeste goes everywhere with us!"
5,Celeste is best!,"My son has had both Celeste the Sun and Max the Monkey since before he was born. We hung Celeste on the bathroom mirror next to his changing pad and he just loves her! Ever since he became more aware of things around him, he was always drawn to Celeste. He always smiled and talked to Celeste while we were changing him. He is now 6 months old and still smiles every time he sees her! What a great toy!"
5,Happy sun is baby's friend!,"A simple toy with a high ""baby attention"" factor, it keeps kids fascinated. My only very minor gripe is the ""squeaker"" toy inside one of the attachments is pretty hard to work - even my 3-year-old can't make it squeak. Otherwise, a great toy."
1,Strangulation Hazard,"This product was a hand me down from my sister and was used by my first two and now our third. They loves the toy, but just this evening when I went to check on the baby I found one of the strechy pulls wraped around his neck. I don't think he was suffocating (yet), although he was definitely struggling to get free. I had the toy hanging in the crib, which I think made things worse since it was essentially acting as a noose once it got wrapped around. I don't know if the newer version of the toy has sorter pulls, but in any case I will alert the CPSC tomorrow."
5,Great toy to keep little hands busy!,I bought this after reading the reviews. We keep it in the car as the special car toy. My daughter loves playing with it. The fact the she can make it make noise delights her!
3,A beautiful toy but my kid hated it,"I bought this right after my daughter was born. It is nice b/c it has a hoop that you can attach it to stroller/ car seat, etc., but my kids did not like it. I kept it but they rarely played w it. It gets wet when they chew it & all in all I didn't care for it."
5,Our baby loves it,"My husband and I decided to buy this toy because we wanted a toy that has everything on it. We liked that it had a rattle, squeaker and a teething star. Our baby has loved it from day one, she loves the bright colors and different textures on it. She has learned to grab on things now and she is always grabbing the black and white attachements. She has also started teething and is always chewing on it, it makes her happy."
5,Really fun - my daughter immediately loved it!,This was the first toy that my now two month old daughter actually liked! She tracks it and smiles at it. I'm hoping as she gets older she will like the other options on it.
4,Great Toy,I agree with all of the other positive reviews of this toy. We got this for our daughter when she was about 3 months old and she loved it then and still does at 10 months! She still plays with it as often as she did in the beginning. I highly recommend it!
4,Lots to keep baby's attention,"We got this to put on our activity mat arch. Our son really likes it, especially when the lady bug squeaks. He also likes touching all the different textures on the front and back."
4,Attention getter!!,"It takes a lot to catch and hold my daughters attention for very long. The Celeste is great...and inexpensive! I tied it to the crib bumper so that it hangs and my daughter can pull at it while in her crib. She loves it. It's bright and soft and the hanging pieces all make different sounds. My only complaint is that the squeaky ladybug takes a bit of strength to squeeze and a small baby can't get it to squeak, but other than that, it holds her attention for quite a while. SHe even fell asleep holding onto the butterfly rattle!"
4,Good model,This kit came with good markings for the Africa campaign and hasegawa provides some of the best detail in 1/72 scale tanks. You have to make your own antenas out of fishing line and painted black.
5,Book on Baby Discus,"I had this book many, many years when I first started out raising discus fish. Great book for its time, now has become part of the Discus Fish History. Please to have a copy in personal aquarium library once again."
1,disposable wound measuring guide,I was sent paper rulers that measure 6 in. Nothing at all like what I thought I was getting. The picture of the product I ordered is what I wanted. I have no use for the items I was sent.
5,"If you like Dee Henderson, you'll love Rolling Thunder!","What a great first novel! For those who love Law & Order or CSI, Rolling Thunder will be a sure-fire favorite.Balancing an interesting and appealing story about an estranged son/father and the thrill and intrigue of a detective story, Rolling Thunder will appeal to both men and women.Can't wait for the next one!"
5,Excellent novel,"""Rolling Thunder"" is a great novel about a policeman and his past, family, and associates. I found the characters to be very authentic and genuine. I found the story engaging. The descriptions are excellent, and the conclusion was very satisfying. This is a great novel."
2,Flimsy,"The clip separates from the case too easily. I usually attach it to my belt above the rear trouser pocket. I had two of these and the clip broke off on both when sliding in and out of the seat of my car. The clip should be fastened more securely perhaps with rivets. As always, Amazon shipped this item quickly and is not responsible for the quality."
1,Dreadful,"Errol Barrow was the Barbados Prime Minister, not Earl Barrow as Sylvia Hampton renames him - Marion Anderson's accompanist Blanche Burton-Lyles was the first African American to graduate from the Curtis Institute,not Marion Anderson herself. Sloppy research - these were real events, which were important in the life of Ms. Simone.As someone who came to know Ms. Simone's music first through her CD's and then by watching various clips on youtube and reading articles, etc posted on the net, I can truly say I learned more from youtube and google than from this book."
2,not recommended,"I do not recommend this book. It is too general and does not offer truly usable advice. The main message is: As a wealthy person, you are a target for lawsuits. Lawyers go after the deep pockets. Asset protection is very possible, but the details are complicated. Mintz writes a lot about filing the ""appropriate"" documents, but never bothers to explain what appropriate really means. Therefore you should leave this complicated matter to an experienced attorney, you guessed correctly, the author. The book is mostly a sales pitch for his legal practice.I contacted him with a request to provide me with a structure my assets. I had very few at the time, but they are growing. He did not even bother to answer. I assume his fee depends on the assets under management and I assume he is just fishing for wealthy clients..."
1,No forms or worksheets,"I was disappointed that this book did not include any do-it-yourself forms or worksheets. Although it included extensive discussions on the background of asset protection law and the strategies used by the author, I felt that appropriate forms to accomplish this planning should have been included in the book. The information in the book may be valuable to those who can pay an attorney to set up a plan, but those of us who cannot afford those fees would have benefited greatly if the forms had been included. mlh"
1,NOT published by the University of California Press,"One of the earlier customer reviews states, ""I was surprised that this book was published by the University of California Press."" In fact, the book was NOT published by the University of California Press. It was published by a company called ""University Press, California,"" that is located in San Jose, California."
1,Facts and Rants,"Joseph's book contains abundant promise and abundant disappointment. Its bookends--the start and finish--provide provide reasonable interpretations of data from neurological and fossil research. The center, unfortunately, merely affords a bully pulpit for the author's unsubstantiated rants about religious literature, especially the Koran and the Bible. This juxtaposition of authority and speculation is paralleled by displays of scholarly writing (e.g., citing sources for stated views) at the outset and junior high writing (e.g., missing citations and bizarre interpretations of religious writ) in the middle. Joseph is to be commended for his imagination, but misrepresents his book as a scholarly contribution."
2,Too small.,"I got the brown dog and the pink dog. I thought they were not that small, but these didn't work on my 8 y.o. kids. They were uncomfortable for them. May be it works better on smaller kids. They are cute though, and very soft. The seam breaks easily. I'm returning them to the store I got them."
5,Don James was a genius even when he was taking snapshots...,"In the movie, Atlantic City, Burt Lancaster's character says with nostalgia, ""You shoulda seen the ocean then."" It was an ironically funny line. But in this lovely collection of photographs we do see the ocean back then, in a time when one could camp on the beach in privacy, feasting on abundant lobster & abalone. The 100 pound boards have a beauty of woodcraft no longer known in the sport, & the surfers ride them like boats, upright & confidently. They look so much like us. The women are pretty. The waves are works of art. Those distant surfers weren't environmentalists, but they, more than anyone, were witnesses to what is now lost. Don James was a genius even when he taking snapshots."
1,Limited and archaic,"While this book has a few good pointers and general guides to the profession, it is very outdated and focuses on the way architecture and professionals ""used to be."" The author explicitly reminds readers that those who aspire to be architects should let nothing get in their way and that being an architect enables one to become ""immortal"" through ""his"" work. This model is no longer relevant in a work environment where more than ever, architects must be better listeners, civil servants and good designers. It exacerbates the worst parts of studio culture, glorifying them, and telling readers to ""enjoy the psychological pains"" of architecture school."
3,A little off the mark,"The book was published awhile ago and doesn't acknowledge some of the newer architecture schools.Additionally the author is not an architect, but did go to architecture school, and then became an architecture critic.The book is comprehensive and objective, but there are better books on the subject.Take this with a grain of salt as I am not an architect either, but am looking into becoming one.Finally this book says in 150 pages, what it could have said in 50.Some good information that shouldn't be overlooked, but......."
5,A must read!,"This is a wonderful sequel to 'Enchantress from the Stars', telling about the further adventuers of Elena. As good as the first book. But please, why isn't it in print?"
2,"dull, drawn out","This book should be compressed to a short story. Not bad, overall, but the basic ideas are repeated over and over again, drawn out interminably.Hard to stay awake through it all."
4,The World Below Eye Level,"Ever since I was a kid, I have been fascinated with miniaturelife among the reeds of grass, and small dolls/ objects ingeneral. SUMMERTIME SONG'S illustrations allow me toparticipate in that world. It's a thrill each time I pick it up!"
2,Hard to find parts and hard to reel in the hose,"When my house painter couldn't figure out how to use the nozzle, he somehow took apart the hose and lost one of the parts. I looked everywhere on-line for a replacement part, but could not find anything. Finally, I called Hozelock in New York and they sent me a replacement part. They charged me about $6 for shipping a part that cost about $3. The system can't be used with a regular sprayer or a regular sprinkler. Also, it is hard to reel the hose in. Overall, I don't think this item is worth the cost. If you need to call Hozelock their number is 1-800-297-7461."
2,Too enclosing,"This is a very pretty and soft hammock, but because doesn't have any crossbars to keep it open, it encloses around you when you lie down in it."
4,"anthology and textbook, all in one","Sober, an influential philosopher of biology and science at UW-Madison, offers a clear and intelligible introduction to philosophy in this book. Chapters on religion, ethics, epistemology, metaphysics et al., are all remarkably clear and cogently argued.Just as valuable as Sober's lucid lectures are the sections of primary text that he liberally excerpts. Generous portions of Sartre, Plato, Descartes, and Mill make this text a good way to get a feel not only for the questions philosophers face, but the enormously varied styles with which they have approached and written about them."
5,real simple really right,"i recently bought both the 2' and 4' clamp guides along with the router base and stop block. Building cabinets have never been easier. i use it for dado's, and edge work sets up in seconds is extremely accurate. Saves me time on set ups,with its ease of use. the router base installs easily,and is a joy to use.clamping action is impressive,i now use the straight edge for numerous functions in the shop.would recomend this tool to anyone who has ever had a edge slip and ruin a cut. those days are gone.."
4,A Good funny romantic anime,"I have seen tenchi muyo before and what i thought of this anime series was a close storyline to tenchi muyo, but in this case it's belldandy and urd fighting over morisato keiichi.This video is a must have for any anime fan."
4,essential watching for any anime lover!,"Possible the best comedy/romance anime series of all time. Anyone who likes Fushigi Yuugi, Ayashi no ceres or Video Girl AI, MUST watch this. Animation, characters and story is simply great.However.. the video quality of the DVD leaves much to be desired. It uses too much image enhancement to make the picture appear sharper, but leaves behind rainbow artifacts and ghosting at the edges of lines. On Svideo or component cables on a decent tv or on a computer monitor, this will be quite noticeable. Its annoying to me, but bearable; though to other people it might not."
3,I did not understand,I did not understand this movie because it was in japanese. I like the movie next time I order one of these movies I will get it in english.
2,Very dissapointing... Lousy package and no deluxe collector's edition,"When I saw the annoucement of this re-issue I was very excited because OMG is my favourite anime series, and as I have the previous editions of the OVAs, I thought this collector's edition would a must have.For instance, the price is expensive for a package that is not worthy enough, and three DVDs including pictures downloaded from internet, is very dissapointing.This collector's edition USA edition is not worthy the price that is offered. To be sincere I prefer the Two-DVD edition.disspointing!"
5,Simply Great,This movie is great. It has great animation and music. The story is easy to fallow. Over all it's the best anime I've seen
5,Sweet and Addicting,"I had two reasons for seeing the Ah! Megami-sama (or Oh! My Goddess!) OAVs. 1. I am a big fan of the manga (it is so addicting!), and 2. There has been so much hype about it. Now I totally agree with the Goddess fanclubs! A cute anime about the love of a goddess and a mortal, but if you add two more goddesses, you get a lot of fun! This story is a nice break from all the blood-shed you see from all the shonan shows and the repetitive nature from the magical girl genre. Even though this was originally intended for a young girl audience, everyone should watch this series! That, and get the manga, it's hilarious!"
5,AH! My Goddess: Season 1 ( Looks of the BOX ),"Length:: 1:26 MinsVideo review: this compares Season one box set's looks and whatnot to Season 2's looks. The individual Volume Reviews and Show reviews I figure can go under the Individual listings of each DVD Volume. This is just to take care of any questions people may have about the looks of the box and whatnot. ( I know I had a few questions) Sorry the Video is a little dark.. I will update the review with a brighter one later, my lighting isn't so great inside. Hope the Video helps with any Questions you may have about the looks of the box."
5,Simply A Masterpiece,"For anyone who loves anime, you have to see or even read the Oh My Goddess Series! and if you don't know what anime even is, pick this up anyway. It's a masterpiece! The English dubbed version was done very nicely. The English sub-title is just as good. It's a shame that there are only five tapes of the series. If you miss out, you are going to regret it."
5,ah my goddess dvd,"Great anime title. This time the anime follows the manga really well. Minor changes to the script, but very well done. Great songs and excellent voice acting."
5,Artistically amazing and very touching!,"Originally 'Ah! My Goddess,' this is the beginning of a wonderful series that touched me incredibly so. I have seen each of the following episodes and was only let down that there were not any more. The drawing and animation is some of the best around and like Ranma 1/2 it stays with you. A very emotional series that left me emotionally confused. I was happy and yet sad. This is my favorite romantic anime of all time. I cannot wait to own all the series."
4,a great show,"Plot of the show: Keiichi, a geeky college student, tries to order pizza but ends up ordering the goddess Belldandy. She tells him she'll grant him one wish, but he doesn't believe she's real so he wishes to have a girlfriend like her. Since there is nobody else like her, she stays with him and becomes his girlfriend, and that's when the trouble starts. Urd and Skuld, Belldandy's sisters, show up later on (in following tapes) bringing more trouble for poor Keiichi.My thoughts: For me, Urd makes the show, it just wouldn't be the same without her... but she doesn't show up until tape 2 I believe. I also like Keiichi, there's something endearingly sweet about him. The manga is better really, and is highly recommended in addition to this OVA. The opening song could be better, and I would have liked to see a longer OVA series. Five episodes just isn't enough. All in all though, a great anime."
4,"A good OVA series, disappointed in the special features","This three-disc DVD set includes all of the episodes of the Oh My Goddess OVA series. Oh My Goddess is a ""magical girlfriend"" series, with the main stars being Keiichi Morisato and Belldandy. The series itself has excellent storytelling and animation. The episodes were compelling, and left me wondering what would happen in the next episode.However, I was rather disappointed in the bonus features for this set. A lot of emphasis was put into including information in a slideshow format. While that in and of itself isn't bad, it's the fact the viewer has no control over how quickly the slideshow goes by. The only way to read everything on each screen is to keep hitting the ""back"" button on the remote, or pause on each page.I would recommend this DVD set for the episodes, because the storytelling and the animation make this set worth the money you pay for it."
1,"BADLY DESIGNED, CHEAP MATERIAL","I haven't had this case for more than a month, and after a one-time use, each zipper bent, and the case itself became frayed, not to mention the wheels only cause the product to be more awkward than over-the shoulder carrying. Not enough space to put linen or face cradle.Don't buy this product; It's full of problems."
2,"having some issues, but love the concept.","I love the concept of the carrier, the wheels roll very nicely, but I'm having balancing issues. when I try to put my supplies in the side pockets the carrier gets off balance and I'm fighting to keep it upright. I'm considering some options to help correct this either by making a saddle type holder for my supplies, or by widening the base of the carrier (by about 5 inches or so) to make it more stable and allow for a large side pocket to stow the supplies in. Still thinking,Trina"
1,Not worth the money,It's been 6 months since I purchased this carrying case and it is already falling apart. In fact it is on it's last stitch. Do not buy this product.
1,No Customer Support,I hoped that the MX-500 would replace my Marantz SR-19 remote. It doesn't have the proper preprogrammed IR code to make it compatible with the Marantz.The HomeTheaterMaster.com web site barely functions and has no customer service. The manual lists a customer service email address that does not work. The Home Theater Master telephone customer service number is non-functional.Be careful.Brock FisherSan Diego
2,Hard to read display,"I bought two of these. One has an OK display the other is hard to see unless you have just the right light and hold it at the perfect angle. I guess you need to buy two or three of these and hope one is good. If all three are bad you could return all three and hope one of the next three is good. A large percent of these ""reviews"" are written by persons trying to sell you the items and are not honest."
3,Clunky and difficult,"I compared this to a Harmony 659. The MX-500 build was solid but not very sexy. I did not like the layout and it was much more complicated to use than the Harmony. The Harmony's online setup is simple, well written and straight forward."
5,"Functional like a hammer; a big, bulky hammer.","Hammers aren't pretty, either; but try to drive a nail with something that is. The only tweak necessary on this thing is that some of the ""universal"" codes don't completely match the OEM remote functions, and you have to ""teach"" the remote what to do in those cases, or search the manual and try different codes. All in all, though, this remote does everything it's supposed to and then some. More macro functions and learning capability than I'll ever need, and I have a HUGE theatre system. Very good purchase, I would do it again."
5,Excellent Universal Remote with Great Functionality,"After performing a great deal of research, I recently decided on purchasing the MX-500 over an Intrigue universal remote. I couldn't be happier with my choice. This remote does everything that it claims and I was able to replace four of my remotes with about 30 minutes of programming. I have a Toshiba big-screen TV, a Pioneer audio receiver, a Sony DirecTV receiver, and a Sony DVD player and this remote works all four of them flawlessly. After entering the pre-programmed codes for those manufacturers, I still had to ""teach"" the remote a handful of functions from the other remotes. The MX-500 learned every ""foreign"" command without hesitation. So far, everything works as advertised and I am very pleased with the remote's capabilities."
4,Great Remote,"I purchased this remote for my husband for Christmas at least 6 yrs ago. We've had it reprogramed for several components and this thing still works. While I am the techie in the house; my husband still manages it pretty well (especially with the macro buttons at the bottom). It was quite pricy when we got it...actually the guy who installed our tv sales pitched it to us. We've moved since we had it and have not had any problems. It's been dropped, flipped, tossed accross the room to each other, been sat on, you name it. It's like the energizer bunny. Been thinking about getting another universal...but why! This one still works!"
5,"Excellent device! Easy to use, lots of custom LED labels","I have had one for >5 yrs and just bought another for a friend. Very easy to use. The keypad has more ""standard"" keys than most remotes plus you can have an additional 2 pages of 10 LED-labels each per device. Highly recommended."
3,I like the remote overall...,"but one thing I never see mentioned is that the display is extremely hard to see, especially at night. The backlight, even with battery at full power, stinks. I am replacing my batteries weekly to maintain a backlight that is half way reasonable because I watch television primarily at night.I actually have a flashlight on my coffee table so I can see the display.Other than this, I agree with the other reviews. But if you can't see it, how good is it?"
4,"Good universal remote, but a little limited","I've had an MX-800 for a home theater system for a couple years and bought the MX-500 for a simpler stereo/TV combination. The MX-800 has many more customizable features than the MX-500 which are needed for a complex home theater system, but the MX-500 is an outstanding universal remote that works well to eliminate multiple remote controls at a much better price. The macros that you can store for the MX-500 are limited but still useful for a small entertainment system. If you have a complex system to control, the MX-500 might be lacking a bit. The MX-500 has a good list of pre-programmed codes for most devices: cable boxes, TV's, VCR/DVD, even light switches. If you can't find a code for your device, as long as you've got the original remote, the MX-500 will easily learn any button you have on your old remotes."
5,Great non pc programmable remote,"Pros: Easily programmed. Great macro functions. Learning remote works well. Like the lcd screen with separate buttons. Amazing range.Cons: Does not work with the motorolla moxi calbe box. I have sent it back to company and they said they will update the codes.-Its not pc programmable. You can purchace IR-clone which allows for pc programability, although then you have to use codes, and not the learning function."
5,Had one for over 4 years never any problem,"This is a great remote, it's survived being dropped, thrown, sat one and lots of button pushing over it's 4 years of heavy daily use. You can't go wrong on this one."
4,Excellent universal remote,"This unit is pricey but is high quality in construction and function. Had an RCA before and it was full of issues and eventually stopped working completely. Takes a minimal amount of time to read the parts of the manual you need to learn how to program the remote, and you're ready to go."
3,Basic Universal Remote,"Nice unit, but not nearly updated enough to make it easy to set up systems with. A nice basic universal."
5,Everything you need... where you need it.,"I've never had a universal remote that didn't force me to comprimise somewhere. Most ""learning"" remotes force you to learn too much and the lack of tactile buttons is a negative for the LCD models. The pre-programmed off the shelf universal's are not nearly customizable for my tastes.The MX-500, however, is nearly perfect. I love being able to put virtualy any function into the top LCD area while still being able to control the remote by sense of touch.I had the entire remote configured for my system in about 15 minutes, but I spent an extra hour programming macros and custom functions because it was so cool. When I turn my DVD player on, my TV switches to DVD input, adjusts its color settings to my preferred movie setting, and the remote sets itself into its custom DVD mode on the LCD. All I need is an IR receiver for my lights (which the MX-500 had preprogrammed codes for) and I'll be in heaven!"
4,Pretty Decent Remote,"Does exactly as described..Programming a little vague, but got the hang of it..Backlite screen a little dim, but acceptable..LCD screen nicer than just a pile of buttons typical of remotes in this price range. Good value..Got it for $75.00..Easily learns old remotes. One click-turns on TV, Stereo, Cable Box, sets correct input on stereo, and ends up on Cable Box for volume and channel control. Now the wife can truly do 'One Click"" operation for the ""Remote Challenged""."
1,Learning Function Useless,"I feel like I'm the outlier here. I see this device has received a vast majority of 5-star reviews.I got all my remotes together, sat down with the instruction manual, and got to work. After 2 hours All I could manage was to turn on and off my DVR. I couldn't manage to get the learning functions to work. I tried, I read the instruction manual, and attempted multiple times. I don't know what I was doing wrong, but the remote would simply not learn the commands like advertised.Maybe its user error, but the device is not intuitive. I have had several Harmony 650s, but they have been fragile with a 12 month old baby in the house and she's broken them. I was hoping for something more robust. However the Harmony 650 set up was a breeze especially with the computer aided programming. The MX-500 was not intuitive at all, and very frustrating."
2,Had to send it back,"Disappointed. None of the codes worked with my Onkyo receiver. I tried the ""learn"" feature but became frustrated (said ""good"" to imply it learned the command, but for some reason still would not work.)Looks nice...fairly straightforward design but again could not use it with my system."
4,Pretty darn good,"This thing is pretty remarkable - just tell it what button you want to program, point your old remote at it and it does the rest. It took about an hour to set it all up, but I went from 6 remotes to 2 (I didn't bother programming all the buttons on the DVD player but I guess I could have). It's a little big but it is easy to read and does the job quite well. It seems quite sturdy so you don't have to worry about dropping it. If you're feeling paranoid about losing your work, it also has a clone function that will clone all the programming features you've put in to a backup unit if you so choose. A solid unit if a bit pricey. But if you're looking to get rid of all (I mean all) of your remotes but one, this is a good choice."
4,Tiffen 67mm Neutral Density 0.6 Filter,What can I say? It fit; and it does what it's suppose to do. It was a decent price and I'm happy with my purchase.
1,Not good for smaller sizes either,"I found that these are not good for smaller sizes (A/B cup)- if you don't fill out the material, then it is hard for it to lie smooth under your clothes."
1,Worthless,"I wear a C-D cup and purchased the body bra to wear with a low-backed shirt. The photo shows the tabs around each side of the breast, but when I did this, it created floppy CONES. Unless you have very small breasts or breasts that basically don't need a bra at all, don't waste your money on this product.I also purchased the Fashion Forms ""Beautiful Lift"" that requires you to tuck the bottom of your breast into a ""canal"" and then put the adhesive over it. The adhesive is NOT strong enough to keep the breast in the shape it describes, and the size D was not big enough for my C-D breasts. I think their sizing runs VERY small, if the product even works at all."
4,5 year old daughter loves it.,"My 5 year old, after seeing this on t.v. has been screaming for this toy. After a week of doing chores, I broke down and brought it for her. First of all, its smaller than what I would expect. I wouldnt pay no more than $20.00. Which is what I did pay for it at wal-mart. It is also a little harder than I expected as well. But the main thing is that my daughter can play with her and put her into the ball. The big suprise is that it smells. Overall a good purchase."
1,"Love the toy, hate the price.","Price Gouger!!! The toy is fine when the retailer has it for sale at the true retail price. This BravoFun company not only sent me the wrong color, they sent me one that did not have any scent left? Old perhaps? Way to close to Chrismas to replace, plus they jacked up the price between when I purchased it and now. Buy one from an ethical store."
2,Buyer beware,"My supervising professor bought this book for me to use in my senior project and I'm glad it wasn't my purchase. My major complaint is that the code examples in the PVM section are trash. I'm not sure if Al Geist (one of the co-authors of PVM) was rushed or thought that it would be good for students to find and correct errors in the code. Perhaps the best part of the book is Chapter 18 which details the experience at Argonne National Lab of setting up their (massive) cluster, Chiba City. There are many better books out there. Try Parallel Programming by Berry Wilkinson and Michael Allen, Parallel Programming with MPI by Peter Pacheco, or anything by William Gropp."
2,Haven't noticed a big change...,"We have been feeding Show Stopper to our 1 1/2 year old Staffordshire Terrier for about 3 months now and I haven't notice much of an improvement in his coat yet. He has VERY sensitive skin and his coat is very thin, so maybe it is just going to take more time than it would for some other dogs. I will agree with everyone though, that it definitely gets him to eat all his food. He now won't eat unless there is Show Stopper mixed in with his food."
5,Show Stopper is a fantastic product,"I have been using the Show Stopper supplement for over 10 months now, and my Shetland Sheepdog's coat is awesome . The coat is more shiny, full and has more vibrant color. Also, this is a fabulous price! I recommend to all canine owners (even if you aren't ""showing"" your dog)."
1,Music is for suckers..just to suck the money out...,"It's just not a good idea to buy reiki music. It's makes you believe that it helps and relaxes, but in realety it is made for weak minds..."
3,Plastic case,"Be forewarned that this cabinet has a plastic body and shelves, not metal. It should specify that in the product description."
4,Early new wave nostalgia trip,"I can't figure out whether this is intentional or not (I wasn't a Heavenly fan, always saw the word ""twee"" associated with the band and figured I'd hate it), but this CD sounds like the very first trickle in the inevitable wave of EIGHTIES nostalgia! It's very enjoyable on those terms, too. The songs are pretty lightweight, but catchy, and I think the band manages to stay away from preciousness. However, if you're as old as me (thirtysomething), you'll have the extra bonus of remembering Dolly Mixture, the Bangles (when they were still a Brentwood garage band, if that ain't a contradiction in terms), maybe even the livelier songs of the Marine Girls...hey, maybe it's intentional after all."
2,"I give them an A for effort, but.......","I give Amelia&Co. credit for carrying on after Mathew's tragic passing. However, they've proven that they're capable of delivering much, much better goods musically than this lumbering effort. With the exception of the decent opening track, there's really nothing interesting going on here. They're stuck in a Stereolab-lite vacuum--with some ""punky"" guitar bits thrown in to arouse interest (And I was floored by the blatant Pizicatto Five ripoff on ""You and A Girl""..surely they can't be that strapped for ideas). This whole experience was like trying to enjoy a VERY stale candy bar. I had to put on my copy of ""Operation Heavenly"" to wash the bad taste of this out of my ears. A major disappointment........"
5,lifetime favorites,"""With a Jug of Wine"" and ""More with . . ."" were the source of my favorite dishes my mother cooked -- she finally bought another set of books and gave me hers when I started cooking for myself. Tasty, sophisticated (especially for ""home cooking"" of the era) without being difficult, and as other reviewers note, some great insights into the food scene and environment of the time. Don't look here for cookies and kid stuff. A couple of my longtime favorites are Boeuf en Daube and Indonesian-style lamb curry: wonderful!"
4,quality,"I have had the 8' guide for over a year and it is yet to make me unhappy. I would reccomend that you get the saw base as it turns the guide into a totally different creature. It is a joy to use but it is difficult to transport and store. The only negative is it's price. In order to get a 4' model an 8' model and a saw base, you will have to fork out about $175. That gets you close to an Easy-Smart which is a more precise system. I think this product is about 25% too expensive for what it has to offer."
5,This is the Best,I have owned many straight edges and with out a doubt this is the best.Its easy to use and very accurate.If you own a work shop this is a must.This is the best money I have spent on a tool.
3,It's okay.,"I bought it used for the song ""Divino amor"". The CD skips in one part, but at least not in this song. I did not like the other songs too much."
5,This is the best meditation technique that I've come across,For some reason me and regular meditation never got along; sitting in one position trying to quiet my mind. This type of meditation is exactly the opposite. You're constantly moving around producing energy. While at the same time receiving positive energy and releasing negative energy. Brilliant
2,"Biography lite, but diverting","This bio of four big stars from Hollywood's golden age is fairly fun, but strictly lightweight; there is no annotation, for instance, and consequently the facts don't seem as unassailable as they should. It is the kind of thing that would be an enjoyable beach read for the casual movie (or gossip) fan--but not something for serious fans."
3,A true novel,Curse of the Starving Class is a great play and then movie by Sam Shepard. It depicts the underside of american life. The dreams of the charecters are unattainable as far as they are concerned and we watch on as they discover this.
4,Heavy on the military references but a good book,nevertheless. I found myself unable to relate to a lot of the military examples but the lessons taught are powerful. Good book but I think my husband would enjoy it more then I.
1,mislead,"The seller claims they will send you 500 labels but they will only send you 100 since you are purchasing only 1 quantity! Very misleading! But when confronted, they feel they are very clear on what you are paying for! Will not buy from this company again!"
1,Pointless purple crayon,"The whole point of ""Harold and the Purple Crayon"" is that Harold creates what he needs and wants with his purple crayon. Therefore, in the original series of books, with the exception of Harold himself, everything is only a purple outline, because he has drawn it with his purple crayon. In this book, the drawings are in color, with only a purple outline around the multi-colored drawings. Is Harold now carrying around a 10 pack of colored pencils? How does this book demonstrate that Harold is drawing anything with his purple crayon? It doesn't make sense. The magic is absent. How sad that we think children need color more than imagination. They've taken away the entire plot and purpose of the book. ""Harold and the Purple Crayon"" was one of my favorite books as a small child, and I still read it to my three children, but sadly, this is nothing like the original."
4,harold:under the sea,"Harold and his purple crayon are back. This time Harold draws an undersea adventure for himself and his dog Lilic. They encounter many things while on the adventure such as unique fish, an underwater cave, a sunken pirate ship and more."
4,Works as advertised,Does what it is supposed to do. It is simple to use and includes all the conversion charts in case you are using it with different types of wood or in extreme temperatures. I am very pleased with it so far (have only had it for a month) and look forward to years of reliable use.
3,Product is fine but the cover not so convenient in use.,I used the same product before & this product is same nice to use like before. But they changed the casing & new casing is more fragile than before.
5,woodworker12,"After testing this meter with a more expensive model, I am very pleased with the results. A good basic meter which is worth buying again."
2,Too Complicated!,"My 87-year-old father is a woodworker. I bought this meter for him at his request. It was too complicated for him to use, and didn't measure moisture in small enough increments. I'm returning the item."
4,Mini Ligno E-6 Review,This is a great mositure meter. I bought it to replace a PSI meter that burned out after only 6 months. Wished I had bought this one in the first place and saved myself $39 I wasted on the first meter. It doesn't pay to go cheap.
4,mini-ligno moisture meter,Easy to use. It seems accurate when used on either kiln dried or air dried materials.
4,"it's a Buff, so it's great...but really warm","I really don't know how many BUFF's I now own. I bought the first one when the first Survivor thing came on - just love 'em for all the versitility. I am literally never without one. I carry one in my EDC bag, one in every glove box for the family, one stashed in lots of different jackets, fishing bag, canoe bag, and last year I bought a bunch on them on clearance for $3 each from REI...so yeah, I love BUFF's.My wife got me the Polar Buff a few years ago. I've only found one use for it I can stand - sitting IN a tree stand. That's it. To me, a regular Buff under a hat or shell is all I've needed - even down in the teens, weatherwise. This polar Buff is really, really warm. Hiking or canoeing it's just too hot for me.That said...if I'm gonna be sitting still in the cold - I take it and like it. If you are really cold natured, this may be a great product for you as well."
1,Terrible! Don't fall for a gimmick,"Don't not fall for a gimmick. Buy a regular neck gaiter and a real ski mask. This thing is terrible. First, it is poorly made, the thin material part on mine looks like it was cut with scissors and melted on the edge. Wearing as a ski mask it does not channel breath away like real ski masks, so it fogs up the goggles. It also gets wet and cold immediately. It does not have a shape like ski masks do, so it keeps getting in you mouth. It also bunches up in one thick lair so I actually keep feeling cold on the back of my neck. Absolutely not recommended."
3,"Tighter than the ""original""","I love Buffs! The ladies size works best for me, but I wear the original too. This is my first Polar Buff, and I find it a little uncomfortable - since it's so long, the fabric bunches up a lot, and it ends up feeling rather like wearing a neck brace. I can fiddle with the material to make it tolerable, but instead I just don't wear it all that often. Also, I do like to wear them in multiple ways, and I think that's hard to do with this style. I'll keep purchasing Buffs, but not this style."
1,Disappointed,Not what I expected...does not keep your face warm..very light weight and wind still blows through it..I wish I had returned it..not worth the $
3,gift,"I purchased this for my daughter-in-law. She had it on her wish list. We have had an early Christmas and I was able to see the gift on her. She seemed happy with it. She wanted something to wear when running outside in the winter. It was okay but I would not have purchased this item for the price if I had seen it in person.Depending on how it's worn, one looks like they just arrived from the ""old country""!"
4,Good Buy,"Very nice, attractive comfy sandals for the busy professional who spends a lot of time on her feet."

2,not for teaching grandchildren,"I bought the book thinking I could introduce some mechanics to my grandson, based on the cover photo.However, there are no photos in the book, only line drawings and brief explanations which are not always clear to a non-expert. Thus it lacks beauty and perspective ( as bearings)."
1,THIS BOOK IS NOT GOOD,"it has too many similar mechanical ideas/pictures and the picure quality is poor. I understand those picture/diagrams are very old, and the printing itself is not the problem. My desires were for documentation on the mathamatics of design, not simple drawings with a paragraph of description."
2,Not Great,"This appears to be a reproduction of an old book of unstated vintage. My guess would be from the 1870 to 1890 period. The illustrations are a bit small and a bit crude... I felt a few of them were misdrawn enough to be unworkable as shown. A lot of the mechanisms shown are really basic things like simple levers or pulleys unworthy of space in a serious book. And the whole book is poorly organized. My advice is to save your money for the ""Ingenious Mechanisms"" series."
4,Great for Movement,"This book is around for a reason, even though it is old. The movements cover a huge variety of shape and patterns. The drawback is that the movemnt is shown in very limited form. There is a word explaination with drawings, but even still a single piscture may not be enough. Great to browse through and probably a handy referance for any one who is mechanically inclined to produce their own stuff. Fun book."
2,Sad,"well... it is what it says it is. I was under-whelmed. This is just a reprinting of old old patent drawings with very incomplete descriptions of the mechanisms described. In fact all of this is duplicated in ""1800 Mechanical Movements Devices and Appliances"" down to the word for word copy of the descriptions.Most of the diagrams are self explanatory; of those that aren't, very brief 1902 style descriptions which are probably abridged versions of the original patent application are only a little helpful. The rest (about 15 percent) still don't make sense.I was disappointed and I only paid 5 dollars for it."
2,Not really a book!,"I give this book a A+++ for content! but its a thin little catalogue looking thing, 7"" x 6 1/4""... looks like it only cost 40 cents to make... The picture makes the item look better then it is! Not worth the cost!"
2,"Okay, but very dated","This is a reproduction of a book originally published over 100 years ago. There are a fair number of mechanisms presented with some explanation, but overall the ideas are now very dated and there are better books out there."
2,you can borrow mine,a descent primer for those wanting to be inspired. Not impressive but a good way to get some insight into some simple ealry 1900's gadgetry
3,Interesting,"I design machinery for a living, so I always look for better ways to do things. This works well on the coffee table. Many of the mechanisms are obsolete oddities, but many are useful. It's good to remind yourself of basic principles."
2,Pages are photocopied.,Glad I didn't pay too much for this. The pages are photocopied (poorly). I could have made this in my garage.
3,interesting,"I bought it for the clock escapements but there is a lot more.A lot of interesting mechanisms, but very small drawings."
1,Not what I was expecting,"Another case of ""I should have found a copy to thumb thru first"". Apparently all of the pictures in it have been copied directly out of a book printed around 1900. I didn't see anything original in the book. If you're a rank beginner perhaps it would help you a bit, but I'm just sorry I bought it."
2,"Interesting to read, well ""look at"", but poor...","This book is interesting, but IMHO, it has too many similar mechanical ideas/pictures and the picure quality is poor. I understand those picture/diagrams are very old, and the printing itself is not the problem, but still, they could resize the diagram little bigger."
3,Advanced steampunk niche,"Clear drawings and terse explanations of gears, ratchets and similar mechanisms for nineteenth century nerds (myself included). Useful if you're building clockwork mechanisms. I finally understand how the same hook that dangles a heavy lifeboat can also easily release it (and it's the same hook that releases a catapult arm, yay!) Never going to be a thriller movie."
2,"Too much information, short description",It has a lot of devices but only one picture per device and explained only in a couple of lines. Some pictures are blurry and difficult to understand. Just my opinion.
5,very good for the mechanical thinker.,this book is fantastic for starting out on mechanical engineering knowledge and to use small scale ideas in real world problems ranging from the very complex to the very basic.
2,just o.k.,"The illustrations are well done, many of the mechanisms are repeated. The descriptions are dated. All in all, I would not buy this book again."
3,A little classical encyclopaedia,"This is a fun, old-fashioned IX century book about mechanical devices. It consists in drawings and extremely short descriptions. May be of some interest for do-it-yourself amateurs like me; some devices are of outstanding ingenuity, some others nearly absurd. Anyway, a pleasure to look at."
3,Cute little coffe table book on mechanisms,"This is a nice little book on mechanisms - best for a coffee table or waiting room. Fairly low on useful detail but good for an overview or exposure to many different types and applications of mechanisms. For a more thorough book, I highly recommendMechanisms and Mechanical Devices Sourcebook, Fourth Editionwhich has a broader spectrum of movements that is well categorized and with more detailed supporting information."
5,Your Pupil Loved It,"Dr. Hutton, along with her colleagues, did a marvelous job in conveying the issues affecting minorities in journalism. I think the text is required reading at Dr. Hutton's Alma Mater, The Univesrity of South Carolina."
2,Do Yourself a Favor and skip this....,"Even after reading the warnings of the other reviewers, I gave it a try. Should've listened to the other reviewers.And for the the reviewer who considers them ""intelligent"" for re-vamping their anti-thatcher tune to be anti-bush and blair. Nothing bothers me more than ""artists"" who know nothing of politics offering their opinions on the matter."
3,Lighthearted Comedy,"I enjoyed this movie. It is a lighthearted comedy, with a good lesson in honesty for the younger viewers. Beautiful scenery.One of those movies you don't mind watching more than once."
5,A little gem - very funny early Sandra Bullock,"Why was this film not a huge hit? It's hilarious. Sandra Bullock in one of her early screen roles is hysterical, the locations are breathtaking (shot all around Nova Scotia for New England) and the cinematographer is the guy that won the Oscars for the Lord Of the Rings movies. Very funny, very romantic, and worth seeing if you haven't already. The only downside is Denis Leary, who is his usual doltish self. But Sandra Bullock and the gang that chases her more than makes up for him. All up a little gem."
5,Best,"One of the best movies I have ever scene. The actors are superb, the one liners are hilarious. It is just a fantastic movie."
3,"Dry humor, but still funny at times.",This is a very slow movie about a thief (Denis Leary) and his girlfriend (Sandra Bullock) who are forced to hold up in a vacationing couples home until they can escape the police.Leary is his usual naurotic self while attempting to save his relationship with Bullock.
1,Couldn't even finish,"This was bad. The story was weak, and the acting was bad. I'm usually pretty entertained by ""bad"" movies, but this was too much. Couldn't even finish it."
2,stupid movie,I found this movie to be quite stupid. The usual quality found with Sandra Bullock was sadly missing. I wouldn't give it room on my shelf.
3,Gets Tiresome,"This book has some amusing moments and maybe a couple of real laughs, but after a bit it gets monotonous. The writing doesn't really flow naturally and it becomes difficult to read. I prefer Vicki Iovine's books and sense of humor."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this book. Not only is it very small in size (about 3""x3"") which makes it hard to read, the farther I got in this book the more critical it seemed to get. If you parent in any way different from this writer, you are looked down on. I am very sorry I waisted my money on this book."
3,You won't get a 2 pack!,"This item arrived the first time squashed in a box with the rest of my order, only one pack of perches. I thought I had a replacement order for the 2-pack of 3 perches, but only one pack was sent even though it was supposed to be the 2-pack. I think whoever is picking and packing the product doesn't understand that 2 packs are supposed to be sent, perhaps because they're not packaged as such. Hardly worth $4!"
1,Got a defective DVD,The DVD they sent us was defective. It would not play the entire video and would stop in the middle of the scene. I've emailed and called Train Video Depot and no one has gotten back to me. Be careful when ordering from Train Video Depot!!!
4,Pretty good,"This 1962 Columbia cast album of Show Boat is pretty good all around. With a handpicked cast of some of the biggest musical stars of the time, Goddard Lieberson couldn't go wrong. John Raitt as Ravenal, Barbara Cook as Magnolia, and William Warfield (from the 1951 MGM film) as Joe. All the rest of the cast are great as well. This was the most complete cast recording of Show Boat when first released in 1962 and was up until McGlinn's set was released. The only reason this album gets only 4 stars is that the bright and brassy orchestrations are such that all the songs begin to sound alike after awhile. Other than that, not many gripes. Highly recommended."
3,Some_Thing_Else,"First time i listened the album I was deeply disappointed. Second, third... I started to enjoy it. Is not that bad but also not a masterpiece. The rule works again, when a band leaves the underground, usually they change the musical direction for worse. I didnt wait for a second Mandylion but at least for a new ""weird"" vision as was How To Measure A Planet. If_Then_Else has less and less Gathering distinctive sound. They seem to slowly melt into mainstream musical ocean. Hope at least financially will be better for them. If you are a Gathering fan, buy this CD for tracking their further e(in)volution. The Gathering still remains one of my favourite bands."
5,This is what I want,"After their previous album (How to measure a planet) I thought The Gathering had had their best days. But when I heard the first song of this album (for download on their website) I could'nt wait for the album to be released. And it is good, the nice heavy guitars are back and I really like it this way. Keep up the good work!"
5,Grew Up with this book,"I love these books. This one is very special to me. My mother brought it for my big brother when we were kids. It became the book that he read to me all the time but always allowed me to say the ""Me too"" parts. I'm starting my daughter's book collection and Mr. Myers books will be the first ones on her shelf."
4,Great Little Gift,I bought eight or nine of these books for my nephew for the holidays. I think he's going to really enjoy them.
5,Do they come any cuter!,Highly recommend these books. We are purchasing them for the second generation and they are as big of a hit as they were when we bought them for our ownkids!
1,MR. SERV ON WAR IS ME PART 1 BATTLE DECISIONS,ONLY ONE TIGHT SONG THE ONLY REASON I EVEN GAVE HIM A CHANCE WAS CAUSE HE JUST SIGNED TO DIRTY THUG AND THOUGHT MAYBE HE CHANGED BUT THIS IS WORST THEN WHEN HE WAS WITH NO LIMIT
4,Serv-on is tight,"War Is Me: This CD is not bad like some of these people rank it. Some people don't like it because it has no no limit soldiers in it. You don't need the soldiers to make a good CD ask Mystikal. 2,6,7,13,17, are all five stars songs. I rank this one a four star. I think it could have been Serv-on best CD if he took his time on it. He had Da Next Level that came out in 1999 and his new one came out in May 2000. But still a good CD and its definitely worth buying."
1,I don't like to hate but...,"This Album bit quite hard, It dissapointed me greatly. Good luck in the future to serv. This one needs to go in the shredder though."
4,Does the Job,"I have the 8 footer to cut up sheets of plywood accurately. I don't have the sliding carriage, although I might get that later. It's very accurate. The only gripe I have is that the clamping mechanism is fixed on one end. It becomes awkward to use on anything less than 4' long without extra support. The maker should make both clamp ends moveable so that the user can balance the straight edge on the work."
5,Good filter for foilage and green laser pointers,"The green 11 filter helps mostly for lightening dark green foilage (brush, grass, etc) against a dark background. It will pass more green and attenuate red/orange and blue tending to darken the sky.For forensic documentation, alot of glow phosphors are green - such as a spectrum analyzer or tritium tubes. This filter helps to highlight the green emissions from those phosphors against the background. The camera can be changed to B&W; mode or left in color depending on the intent of the shot.With a bulb exposure tracks left by a green laser pointer are highlighted and show up almost as handwriting (with practice this can make unique shots). When using the green pointers for night sky exposures, the green filter aids in showing the beam pointing to a star especially against the dark sky."
5,Excellent,"This is simply great great music. Fun, creative and sophisticated too. Ed Palermo's arrangements of these compositions is fantastic, really fresh, and the band is focused and committed all the way. The solos are well integrated into the music and never seem pointless or meandering. There really isn't a weak track here, everything is strong and memorable, and folks who don't even know who FZ is would like this. Too bad the first disc is out of print as I would have snapped that up immediately without hesitation, especially after hearing this amazing disc. Hopefully it gets re-issued one of these days. I have my fingers crossed for a 3rd installment."
4,Zappa Lives On,"Zappa is a dirty old man in the minds of those who never listened closely. EP Big Band shows Zappa for what he was...a great composer and arranger. Since there will be no more new Zappa, this is a good fix for those still longing for great music that no one else seems to play any more. I'd give the album 5 stars except for the irrelevant ethnic song about America. Sorry folks; I love America when I visit, but this stupid ditty is completely out of context here."
2,Where's the profit?,"So many times I've been told I could sell my projects (most of which are original designs). But knitting is so time-consuming, I wondered how I could ever make a profit at it. This book does not have the answer. There is one inspiring example of a woman who does custom knits for Hollywood stars and prices her garments based on the hours that go into them. Then again, another example is of a woman who sells her handknitted baby blankets for [very little money for the effort] She must make a few cents an hour. What kind of profit is that? The author seems to assume that if you love to knit, you'll be happy making whatever money you can above the price of yarn. There are no details on how to get into selling designs, or opening a shop. Some info on craft shows and how to get started teaching. Includes a few free patterns you are allowed to make and sell."
1,not too exciting,"This book is full of fluff. For a beginner knitter, this is an awful awful book to start with (by the way, vogue knitting: the ultimate knitting book is excellent for all level knitters, especially for beginners...) Everything explained seems to only wandering upon surface; and sometimes i wondered if the authors forgot to finish what they tried to say. Also I hope they can actully organize their thoughts a bit more to write down lists; for instance, list different yarn weights from the lightest to the heavest instead of poping out whatever they can think of. And don't try to explain things in words when diagrams can show better...in other words, this book needs more drawings than fluffy wordy words."
3,"The BOOK was great, but.....","I've been doing sticks for years, and I thought the book was fantastic, but the sticks themselves are the worst I've ever seen, they vibrate when you try to juggle them, so you drop them a lot. Plus in the first 2 minutes (No exageration) one of the hand sticks broke. not the best constuction. The book on the other hand was fantastic, with a better set of sticks, this would be a top notch set."
5,an excellent and well reasoned presentation of pascal,i bought this book after i had heard a presentation by the author based on the book. the author/speaker will not disappoint the inquisitive reader. the views of pascal are presented in a manner understandable to the average reader . a phd in philosopy is not required to enjoy this book.
5,Outstanding! Quite readable - An excellent companion to Pascal's Pensees,"Tom Morris is a gifted writer and philosopher. This book amplifies Pascal in ways you may not have thought about before, and it clearly intriques the critical mind about the possibility of the Truth behind Christianity. The leap from mind to faith doesn't seem all that large after reading this enticing book."
3,Wrong One,"The actual company is great, because I had a wood moisture meter for years. When I bought this one, they sent me the wood one again, so I am not able to test plaster or drywall with it. The moisture meter is great, but Amazon wasn't too helpful getting me the product I needed."
1,Misleading advertising regarding free shipping,"This item is advertised as ""free shipping"". The item is advertised on furnitureontheweb site for $101.99. Bottom line is shipping charges are $34.99."
1,Beware of pirated disks,"This appears to be a pirated disk. On the Amazon website (and on the disk jacket) it is described as widescreen and Dolby surround. It is neither. I suspect that both the disk and the label were copied without the permission of the publisher. Although it is described as being sold by a third party at an unusually low price and fulfilled by Amazon, it is troubling to see that such items are finding their way into the Amazon pipeline at all, assuming my suspicion is correct."
2,This version states 1:85 widescreen. It is not!!,"I purchased Badlands expecting a widescreen presentation on par with Days of Heaven or Thin Red Line. Not so. It says 1:85 Widescreen on box but the movie is in pan and scan. And very grainy besides. There seems to be an earlier version with both formats. Get this instead.The movie itself. Seems as if Malick is trying to create a boring, poorly acted, pointless movie. If it has artistic or other redeeming features they are beyond me. But I only went to college for 8 years so what do I know. See the Starkweather bio instead for real horror."
5,mesmeric,"Great film from director Terrence Malick.His low key,economical style perfectly suits this story of two young lovers on the run.Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek are brilliant as the two leads.Spacek's voice over is especially affecting.Malick's use of music is inspired and extraordinary in the way it plays off,contrasts and compliments the beautiful imagery.American cinema at its finest."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This is a 4:3 aspect ratio version, with terrible image quality. The package indicates it is in original format but it is NOT. The image is lopped off on both sides to fit a 4:3 tv. I'd think Terence Malick would be horrified... Amazon should not allow this to be sold."
1,"Great movie, horrible DVD!!!","Ok, I'll not repeat myself about the qualities of this film and the problems of the DVD, juts read the other reviews.If you have never seen this film, rent (or netflix it) this DVD. Do not buy it! It's a scam!Also watch other films by Malick from the excellent Criterion Collection DVDs."
2,starkweather,"this was a pretty lame attempt at depicting charles starkweather without actually saying that it was, but I knew."
1,Awful,"As with all Malick films, he enjoys potraying the stupid as intellegiant; as victims, of the banality of life. The live based on emotions, well so do, dogs and cats.Martin Sheen's character shoots people in the back, and reasons, that their motives are wrong because they are ""bounty hunters"".Listening to the moronic Sissy Spacec character's narration is almost unbearbable.But as with any sociopathic characters that are potrayed in the movies, both of the murderers in ""Badlands"" are extremely good looking.Which makes his next project of the murderous and good looking Che, seem appropriate."
1,Do. Not. Buy.,"It's extremely rare for a company to outright lie on a DVD case, but here they most certainly did. This is not anamorphic (""enhanced for widescreen TVs"") widescreen, as it says on both the DVD case and the label on the DVD itself. It's not even widescreen- it's 1.33:1, full screen. Disgusting, Warner Brothers. Amazon should NOT be selling this."
1,Warner Bros lies again on the package...,"One star for the format.Be advised that the 2010 release, despite being labeled Wide Screen, is nothing of the kind. It's 1.33:1 (""formatted to fit your tv"") and appears to have been cropped on either side.This is the second time I've been screwed by WB DVDs. I recently bought The American President in a snap case that claimed to be ""enhanced for widescreen tv's"" thinking that at last I'd get a picture I could live with unitl the Blu-ray issue (and no, that is not scheduled). But it was the same non-anamorphic disc that I bought years ago in one of those awful keep cases.So: Caveat emptor. Go with the 1999 edition of Badlands, if you can find it, and you'll get both formats Then you can cheerfully ignore the stupidity of a P&S; image in this day of Home Theater.Shame on WB for mislabeling, and shame on Amazon for not differentiating."
4,"Four stars, three for the movie plus one for the music.","I have not found a recording of the soundtrack, but the most interesting music is available on CD - Carl Orff, Schulwerk Volume 1, Musica Poetica."
3,Great Acting Involved but the film moves along too slow,Martin Sheen in one of his most profound roles & Sissy Spacek play Kit & Holly two young lovers who lead a pusuit with the cops during a wild killing spree througout the midwest. Holly who is only fiftteen years old is consumed with fasination with her older boyfriend that she doesn`t realize he`s an unstable homicidel manic until halfway through the film. Even though the film is filled with teriffic acting from it`s stars and has amazing scenery of La Junta Valley in Colarado the film moves too slow and the viewer is caught up in the prolonging melodrama and by the time the film has reached its inevitable conclusion the viewer is already asleep. This film still remains a classic showing of the American Dream gone bad and where young innocence is shatterd & destroyed by the viloent circumstances of human nature.
5,"Badlands purchase, Martin Sheen",Very interesting movie with Sissy Spacek and Martin Sheen. One that you'll probably not see on TV. If you like Sheen then you'll like this one. Spacek is looking pretty good in it too.
3,Interesting,"'Badlands' is an interesting picture that has similarities with a number of other flicks (both before and after) such as 'Bonnie & Clyde', 'Taxi Driver' and 'Natural Born Killers'. Like Jodie Foster in Scorcese's 'Taxi Driver', 'Badlands' has Sissy Spacek as a child thrown into the realities of adulthood and human depravity before her time. Malick constantly juxtaposes images of childhood and innocence alongside the world of murder and violence with which Spacek finds herself suddenly involved. Sheen is the anti-hero along the lines of De Niro's Travis Bickle (was that before or after? Possibly after), a gun-wielding youth who finds himself hailed as something of a hero when the police finally catch up with him. So, we find the director raising questions about the glorification of violence and the twisted values of popular culture. Left me with the same bitter taste in my mouth that I had after watching 'Taxi Driver'."
3,Overrated,"Martin Sheen puts in another performance more menacing yet slightly the same ('James Dean') as California Kid. It's not an awful movie, but neither is it great, and certainly not riveting. It's a kind of a by-the-numbers Bonnie and Clyde tale, though the movie (Bonnie and Clyde) with Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway blows this one out of the water. See that first if you haven't."
2,"The interviews are great, but...","The first two thirds of the book takes interviews with top American designers and puts them into articles with commentary from the author. It all comes off as pretentious and boring to me.The last third of the book contains the actual Q&A; for the different designers. This is the most interesting part. Successes and failures are questioned and I feel like the designers gave honest answers. If I could just get the interviews instead of the rest of the book I'd be happy.If I had to do it all over again, I would probably have skipped this purchase."
3,interesting historical artifact,"This CD contains 11 opera excerpts, 2 from Das Rheingold, 1 from Die Walkure, 3 from Siegfried, and 5 from Parsifal. Considering the time period of these recordings, they don't sound too bad, technically speaking. The Ring tracks suffer from extremely poor orchestral intonation (the Bayreuth orchestra sounds like a mediocre community group under the direction of Franz von Hoesslin). The performances in the Parsifal selections are much more accurate. The singing is especially strong and clearly recorded. This CD might be of interest to serious listeners who want a historical perspective."
5,"Great book, Great seller","The book arrived on time, and was gorgeous. I bought it as a gift, and can't wait to give it to her. The book is large with fantastic glossy pictures of all the parks. Great buy for someone who is interested in the parks"
2,Superfluous Hits Album,"This is an inessential collection of EW&F. More economical to get Greatest Hits, a single disc compilation instead."
2,The Two Stars Are For Presentation,"Earth,Wind & Fire's first greatest hits album is so musically well constructed it's almost worth those who own the albums already to have it.The same isn't true with this one-tune's like ""Love's Holiday"",""Serpentine Fire"",""Mighty Mighty"" and ""Boogie Wonderland"" are classics but the overall album doesn't flow together half as well as the first.The juxtaposition of era's is jarring too-the production and style of some of the songs have too much of a range and makes it seem well....dated in parts.Better to purchase the chronological and extensive 'Eternal Dance' box set-it has ALL the hits in the proper order and is frankly better mastered."
3,I Am Surprised At All Of The Negative Reviews!!!,"I own both Best of CD's by EWF. I am glad that I do. This one completes what I feel are some of their best songs!!! I am surprised at all of the negative reviews! Maybe I missed something??? My favorites on this one are Turn On (The Beat Box), Let's Groove, After The Love Is Gone, and Devotion. I wasn't that much of a fan of EWF till recently...so, maybe they are what I have missed all along."
4,chicco cortina stroller in atmosphere,"I bought this stroller trying to find a nice, reasonable priced stroller since my 9month needed one, he of course outgrew his stroller that came with his baby carseat, I couldnt find the other blue color that i wanted by chicco, it isnt being made any more, so when i came across this, I was excited. Everyone comments how smooth it rides, the only thing i can say is that the color is a lil darker than pic, almost like a blue jean color but it still looks great!"
2,Seat Cover Nearly IMPOSSIBLE to Remove for Washing,"The stroller as a whole is so-so. It's rather flimsy and cheap--as other reviewers have mentioned, the wheels are cheap and bouncy, the wheel locks only worked reliably for about 5 minutes, the canopy is pretty much a joke. The thing that bothers me the most, however, is the difficulty in removing the ""washable"" seat cover--yeah, it's washable if you've got a couple hours and a couple engineers handy in order to get the thing off! The majority of the straps holding the seat cover in place come undone in a snap. But there are two straps near the feet that literally took my wife and I 30 minutes and a handful of various kitchen tools to get loose! Boo."
5,Excellent customer service,"This is an excellent stroller and Chicco has outstanding costumer service. I'm very happy with the quality of this stroller and have used it very often for walks and even a few jogs. Recently the handle that opens and closes the stroller broke after about 1 and 1/2 years of use. I notified the company and after just a few simple questions, they replaced the entire stroller for me - they paid for shipping too! I didn't even have to send the broken stroller in, which could have gotten expensive and time consuming. I had the new stroller after only about 1 and 1/2 weeks - so they sent it very quickly.I would definitely recommend the Chicco company. It's nice to know that after spending money on a stroller that Chicco will back their products."
1,Garbage,"I, like so many others, was drawn in by all the five star ratings. I couldn't even make it one hundred pages in. This book sucks. It's not because of the subject matter or the anti-government propaganda or the hard right Christian fundamentalism. I can deal with all that in a work of fiction. It was the writing that made me throw up in my mouth a little. I've read better from elementary school children. I won't cover all the problems I had with this book, other one and two star reviewers have done it better.If you are interested in this book in the slightest, please read as many different reviews as possible. It's not for everyone and actually shouldn't even be allowed for human consumption."
2,Survivalist manual: 3 stars. Novel: 1 star,"Your liking or disliking of this book will depend on whether or not you share Mr. Rawles hard-core survivalist mindset. While the book is ostensibly a novel, it reads more like an outline of a novel, heavy on technical details of survivalism, particularly guns, and on Mr. Rawles' daydreams about how he personally plans to save the world and give all the globalist conspiracies their comeuppance, come Judgment Day.As a novel, the book is almost unreadable. Most sentences are written in the passive voice and use various forms of ""to be"" as the sole verbs. Characters have no personality, dialogue is stilted, and plot flows along at the speed of cold molasses. But if you're deeply into survivalism, you may find that Mr. Rawles' fantasies resonate with your own, and you may not care that he writes at a grade-school level of proficiency."
1,Dangerous,"This book is poorly written and gives a dire prediction of economic stress. It encourages violence and guns as the only solution, which is totally barbaric and stupid. A waste of money. I threw it in the trash."
2,What's with the comma?,"I'm eager to find a gem among one of these self-published books, but if this guy doesn't know how to PUNCTUATE his own NAME I think I'll safely pass. I've seen people abuse commas before but sticking one in your name is ridiculous. And yes, that's all I need to see to never read this book."
4,A little Paranoia is Good to have,"This book is unique in the sense that it is written in novel form and gives textbook details. While I found it a little redundant in character development I was fascinated by the amount of information woven into the story. For the survivalist this has to be required reading. To those of us hoping that these dire predictions never come to pass, it makes for interesting fiction. I found it easy to read, entertaining and very informative. Wesley is a good enough writer to make the book worth while. Whether it should be taken seriously or not is entirely up to you. I can only say that when the total breakdown of society finally does come to pass and it most certainly will, eventually, the people many of us consider weird will definitely have the last laugh on the rest of us."
5,Prophetic?,"This book of fiction seems prophetic in predicting one possible outcome to today's economic crisis. Written years before the current economic mess, it is uncannily.The struggle to stay alive by this group of survivalists could be a warning for those of us who were late to understand the possibilities of the current crisis to get our act together and prepare for an uncertain future.The story of their efforts to survive the chaos of the post-crisis world and the attempted imposition of a UN imposed governmental framework seems real close to a certainty. The ruthless use of foreign forces to establish a new government, which allies itself with an UN effort to control the once mighty United States, sound and feel like a probability, especially for those who doubt the UN and its attitude toward the United States.The group's eventual overall success sounds less than probable but it is a good, page turning read.Honey, we better get our supplies ready! The stuff may have hit the fan."
2,"Not a novel, a Liberal Bashing Survival Handbook","I wanted to enjoy this book, but I was looking for a novel, as in, entertainment, not a how-to guide.The first third of the book is an exhausting account of their preparation. How many cans of this, how many bales of that etc.. ad nauseum.I'm neither Liberal nor Conservative, but the book felt like the author took this opportunity to accuse all the ills of the modern world on Liberals.I dislike giving an overly harsh review, because the author spent a lot of time and effort producing this book, but that said, it just didn't do it for me, on any level."
1,I wasted my money on THIS???!!!,"I will admit right off of the bat that I bought this book without looking into it, after it was suggested as a book you should read if you enjoyed a certain other Survivalist novel that I had recently read. I didn't even bother to read much about it & just bought it. I can not believe that I paid $ for this book!!! The worst part of it, IMO, is that the writer of this book calls himself a Christian. As an Anabaptist, I found the mindset in this book very unsettling."
3,It was...hmmmmm...alright.,"This book was ALMOST, but not entirely, a waste of time. My first suggestion is you NOT purchase it on the Kindle. The Author uses acronyms over and over and over. It was one of my first purchases on the Kindle. The whole time I read I would have killed for a glossary (there is one.....but on a Kindle it is kind of a pain in the butt to get to)."
2,"""I"" would not read this due to, inaccurate information...","I figured this would be a good read, so I scrolled through the ""look inside"" section. I found a HUGE misconception in his own glossary!!! He states that ""AR"" means automatic rifle, referring to the family of Eugene Stoner design rifles (AR-15, AR-10, etc...).This information is 100% nonsense and false!!! ""AR"", in actuality is the acronym for ""Armalite Rifle"", the main (at the time) manufacturer of the weapon.If the authors information is so false on such a simple concept, it makes me wonder how much of his other information is false???It is possible I ""MAY"" give this book a chance, but would do so with a huge grain of salt"
5,"Excellent, heart pumping, gut check!","Patriots is an excellent, heart pumping, gut check on what could happen if ""the crunch"" happened in the United States. James Wesley Rawles' attention to detail and accurate descriptions/names of supplies are awesome and takes the guess work out of those of us who want to hope for the best but prepare for the worst. This book makes the reader think about the future and what types of things to consider when preparing for ""the crunch"". Excellent read!"
4,Patriots,"Patriots: A Novel of Survival in the Coming CollapseThis is a very good book! Sometimes frightening! It vividly depicts the coming collapse of our socio-ecconomic system and its effects on life as we knew it, in the United States of America. The break-down of law and order. Rioting, looting and wanton murder in our cities and small towns. People forced to ""fend for themselves"", or band together for mutual survival. This book is also very informative. It teaches basic survival skills, as explicitly explained by some of the books characters; from weapons, food gathering, shelter fortifications, water-purification, even bassic combat and gorilla warfare! I myself picked up some extra survival techniques that I never thought of before! This book is not only an excellent novel, it can also be used as a survival manual! No survivalist should pass on this novel! Check it out ASAP, before it's too late!"
5,Patriots,"Great book, seems like you are in the story. Does not seem like the story line could be to far off; considering the way the economy is today. Love the way it takes you from the begining to the end."
5,takes me back to days as a Boy Scout.,"In reading this book, I was reminded of my days in scouting, BE PREPARED was the motto we lived by. Also Scouts stuck together, as friends and in teams. So to this book makes a point of recommending that one be mentally, emotionally and physically prepared. Or as prepared as you can be, given that we really don't know how the major calamity or calamities will hit us. So I recommend it, to those who want to know more, think outside of their safe, little box, and have a chance to survive when the going gets tough, then tragic."
3,Some good info but a little corny.,"There is some good info in this book but sometimes it gets waytoo detailed. What I mean by corny is, for instance, when one of the main characters gets shot in the abdomen and his intestine is hanging out of his body he exclaims ""Oh Crud!"" how's that for realistic!"
1,not good,I didn't finish this book it was really boaring. It is mostly a list of the suplies and skills the charecters have. Everyone is one is wooden and dull. I could go on but other reviws say basicaly the same things so I am writeing the review to contribute to the over all star rateing.
4,Decent read,Decent read but very typical of some PAW fiction. The author does seem to get a little preachy with the religious stuff.
4,Interesting,"You never know what the future holds for you, your family, and this country. Has some interesting ideas and solutions. Hopefully we will never need to use them."
3,Know what you are getting before you buy...,"If you are thinking of buying this because you like fiction and want a good read, stop now! You can do better elsewhere. If you want it because it is a decent survival manual and you are willing to put up with a thin story behind it, then by all means buy it.I just reviewed the author's other work of fiction ""Survivors"" and felt I should go back and review this too since ""Patriots"" is the better of the two. The story is probably equally bad, but you get much more useful information in Patriots.One additional caution: If you don't like being preached to then you might want to avoid this author."
3,It was good...,"This book was a good read, but hard to get through at some points and confusing at others. I realize this is part fiction/part manual, but there were times that it got bogged down for pages and pages over how to put something together or what an acronym stood for. I skipped whole paragraphs at points. What confused me was the random subplots that went nowhere, like why did he tell an entire story about two brothers being hunted by the police and then you never heard about them again. What was that for? Also, the execution of the cannibals. They had canned goods with them, they weren't that hungry, and it was right at the beginning of the crunch, really? Cannibals already? That didn't make sense to me at all and seemed contrived. On the whole though I liked the book because I like this type of fiction, but it certainly pales in comparison to books like ""One Second After"" or ""The Jakarta Pandemic."""
4,Good read,I am not much of a reader but when I was ordering the book Lights Out I ordered this too and it was good.
1,What was I thinking?,"I really can't say much more than what's already been covered in other one star reviews. Its more a set of lists then anything resembling a novel. I know there is an audience for this, but I am not part of it.Patriots: A Novel of Survival in the Coming Collapse"
2,"Bad writing, horrible editing, a few good points","This book could have been (should have been) cut in half--take out all of the authors opinions on the best guns/survival equipment/etc. (might be decent info, but has no place in the book).After you cut all of that out, then put the plot together better--and make the characters realistic. Then you might have a good book.Are there a few good points in the book about scenarios that may possibly happen in our future? Yes. But they are buried too far beneath the junk that should be in a survival handbook (not a novel) and the poor character sketches and obvious author opinions."
3,Ok read if you are looking for survival info,"I liked the concept of the story but this is a rather laborious read. Lots of technical info, little on storyline. Rather boring to read unless you are looking for a how-to manual on survival preparedness."
5,Great update to a wonderful book,"This book is full of great ideas and crucial survival concepts all wrapped into a novel. I just finished my second reading and I always want to take notes but then just decide to keep it as a reference book. No matter what happens to this great country you can apply many of the concepts in this book. I'm sure some people will think that this book is too ""militia"" or too ""Christian"" but if that offends you too much to read the book then it is far more likely that YOU are the intolerant one."
2,disappointing,"As a medical professional, I found Mr. Rawles's descriptions of medical procedures and basic medical knowledge to be laughable at best and potentially downright dangerous. I know that the book is supposed to be a novel, but the lack of factual information and the inclusion of just wrong information reflects very badly on Mr. Rawles's research capabilities and casts a pall over all of the content in the book.There appears to be a personal political and philosphical agenda to this book and Mr. Rawles has apparently chosen to not allow fact to interfere with his expression of that agenda. That choice detracts from his message."
4,good read,"simply written, follows a lot of characters but you can keep them all straight. some of the characters are unbelievably lucky. good info if you're taking notes. borrowed it to friends and they enjoy it."
3,I liked it.,"This book basically gave you an outline of how to get prepared for many ""Society has Collapsed"" scenarios. The story got bogged down by all the details of the weapons and it got really difficult towards the end. That being said, I liked 3/4 of the book. It definitely made me aware that if society did break down, even temporarily, I am woefully unprepared. I began storing food, water, and ammo for all of my guns. I doubt I will ever be as prepared as the individuals in the book, but my family and I will be OK for a couple months. I strongly suggest everyone go to the author's website. It is packed with information. [...]"
1,No! No! No!,"Ok, I'll start off by saying that this story had potential in spots but was absolutely ruined by the author's incessant descriptions of weapons and vehicles and maneuvers. Couple that with the acronyms and thin characters and you have a real snoozer.I think that the author assumed that the readers of this story might have been impressed by all of his military verbiage and chapter-long descriptions of weapons but for someone like me who is a civilian, I quickly found myself skipping multiple pages if I felt like the author was going into one of his ""blah blah blah"" modes. It left the story feeling like a giant slice of swiss cheese with only some stale bread to make a readable sandwich.I found myself barely engaged by the end of the story and not caring what happened to the plot or the characters. I would highly advise checking out other books before giving this one a spin if you are into survival fiction - This one would not be my first choice. Or second. Or even tenth."
4,Much better than expected!,"I had heard about this book from numerous websites but hesitated making the purchase because I thought the writing would be amateurish. However, I was quite surprised to find the book quite readable and very entertaining. The characters were little more than one dimensional, but Mr. Rawles put together a frighteningly realistic version of the future with a multitude of survival and ""prepping"" tips which outweigh any weaknesses in the writing. I appreciated that the author mentions specific brand names of products such as boots, tents, firearms, etc. to help me sift my way through the average to find the very best. Mr. Rawles really, REALLY knows his stuff on a multitude of levels. I highly recommend this book."
4,should be required reading in high school,"this book makes you think. day after day life goes by fairly easily for most of us in the usa.this book shows us just how unprepared we have become as a whole of society.the author does a great job of giving valuable information to the readers while maintaining a very interesting story line. love the ending it`s all in the details. should be required reading for high schoolers in this country, nothing is ever free. people fought and died for our freedoms in this country and i have my doubts as to the caliber of americans today. one thing this book did was inspire me to form a neighborhood shooting club and practice once a month,something i have wanted to do for a while,now if i could just figure out how to get a capital letter on this thing i wouldn`t look like an idiot."
2,It is what it is.,"JWR has a lot of good survival/firearms information like any good libertarian. However, he really should have read a few how-to books on fiction writing, character creation and dialogue. His whole aim with this book was to sneak helpful how-to info and instill survival mentality through the brain's backdoor by making an informational book into a novel. The problem is he's not a fiction writer, so his characters and dialogue end up being wholly bland and unbelievable. A real person doesn't go on unprovoked expository tangents detailing the compatibility of blood types. JWR should have contracted a real fiction writer for this one. Beyond all that though, there is a lot of great useful reference-type information there if you're able to stomach the format."
2,"Survivalists prevail, literature dies","It has been described as a survivalist manual disguised as a novel. If so, the disguise is incredibly poor. The characters are not developed in the least. It is difficult to follow the plotline simply because the characters meld together into one amorphous whole. The dialogue is actually hillarious in an unintentional way. Are there people anywhere in the world (perhaps outside of junior high school) who actually speak like this? Don't waste your time or money. Go to the authors website if you want some practical preparedness advice. The ""novel"" belongs on an ancient BBS, where it apparently originated."
2,Disappointing.,"There's a lot of good, solid technical information salted throughout this book, and that is its sole strength. The plot is paper-thin, characterization nonexistent, and the villains cartoonish."
5,Fiction - its not just for breakfast,"An outstanding book that's easy to read and has edge of your seat action and in the midst of all of that, if you can wrap your mind around it, is a survival manual. This book tells you with great detail how to get things accomplished, what gear to buy, what will be of worth in a post-economic collapse and how to live. On top of all that, it is Christian based thinking!I couldnt put the book down once I started reading it and like many others, I will read it over and over and make notes to myself on what items I might want to purchase in the future. A great book and great information. Thank you Mr. Rawles! I look forward to your next book this fall."
1,"A book about nut-jobs, written by a nut-job","Wow ... I didn't realize how off-kilter and just plain crazy these milita-survivalist types really are. All that was missing here was the big finish with a kool-aid ceremony. The Atheist accepting Christ as his savior ... really? what a bunch of ""bravo sierra"", as the book often uses so quaintly. Making the U.N. out to be the globalistic, freedom-hating organization was a nice touch: that feeds right into the paranoid delusions these people experience on a regular basis. Note to the author: one does not have to be god-fearing to be freedom-loving.If you're into god, guns, playing army, hate the U.N., and love the gold standard, this book is for you. It's four hours of my life that I'll never get back reading this tripe."
2,I Hoped for More,"I had high expectations for this book, but was very disappointed. It is a survival manual but not much of a story. If you want to learn how to store gasoline or make your own soap get the book. If you want an interesting story get something else. The good guys in the story are over the top good, and the bad guys are rediculously bad. For a book that takes place after society crashes there is little to no action through most of the book, and even the action parts are boring and brief. I finished reading it hoping it would get good at the end, but was very disappointed."
4,PATRIOTS: Surviving the Coming Collapse,"Well it may not be a literary classic, but it was a fun read. I look forward to the rest of the series."
1,Another gloom and doomer...,"Mr. , Rawles, however he punctuates his name has rewritten this book a number of times, you might think he'd get it right eventually. Alas, he still thinks that the answer to most problems is superior firepower in the hands of people who think that hoarding nickels and ammunition will help them survive an economic meltdown.His website exists to sell more ""survival"" products up to and including complete retreats located in the hinterlands of Idaho and Montana. He reminds one of the character in that film a few years ago with Robin Williams and the late great Walter Matthau in which the survival instructors real game is to sell his naive students as much army surplus gear and time shares as he can all while preaching about the end of the world.To his credit, after years of lawsuits, counter-suits, investigations, etc. Mr. , Rawles finally stopped taking money from one of his sponsors, a gun training camp located near Pahrump NV run by a wack job Scientologist named Piazza."
2,what would jesus horde?,"heavy on the christian preaching, light on the ""how to"". should be renamed - ""christians will be the only ones to survive the coming colapse"" as they are obviosly the only people the author finds worthy of survival despite the ""token"" jew."
5,A must read for anyone preparing,"If you are a person that ""feels"" things just are not right and are preparing for the worse and hoping for the best, this book is a MUST READ! The information in this book is wonderful and detailed! Many things you may not think of or may not know to expect are covered in this book. Now that being said it is fictional and therefor it is fun to read. I would suggest reading once for the story and then the second time for taking notes! I enjoyed the book, even though I bought it for my husband and never expected to read it. It is a book you will pass around to all your like minded friends. We purchased several copies and handed them out."
2,Disappointed,I didn't enjoy the way this book was written at all. It jumps around from scene to scene and character to character and is hard to follow. Some characters play absolutely no relevance to the story at all. The only thing that I enjoyed was the overall topic of survival. Rawles should stick to blogging and leave the novels to the professionals.
2,Too planned!,"I tried to get through this book, but I just couldn't. It has a great plot....I love this genre, but it just seemed too unrealistic in the fact that they had been planning for years. I would rather read about people unexpectedly trying to survive the apocalypse. You could also see the political slants in the writing....but that could have been the writers intentions. I do like the line that said something about it being better to do all of this planning and looking foolish than yo not plan at all and the end really happening. That's not a direct quote, but I think it is close enough."
1,Below average,"I am open to reading just about anything interesting. So when a friend suggested I should read ""the manual"" on economic collapse in book form, I said sure. I also purchased Rawles other book that details how to be prepared for an emergency scenario and it wasn't bad, so I thought I would give this a try.First, it is concerning because Rawles and others seem to actually think this is happening. Right off the bat, the current events described in the book aren't even remotely accurate. IE the supposed GDP figure that is given for the annual debt servicing.Even if the book is taken as fiction, the characters meant to survive seem to be almost as dark as the villains when things get rough.I would suggest other post-apocalyptic fiction for entertainment purposes."
1,Please dont waste your Money!!,"I think this mans intentions were good, but this book will have your head spinning...its psychotic to be quite honest! There are alot better books on survival out there than this...I was Hugely disappointed!!!"
1,Cheesy book with cheesy writing,"What a let down this book was! I have read many apocalyptic books and this has got to be the worst one! After reading the S.M. Stirling trilogy, Stephen King's The Stand, Lucifer's Hammer by Pournelle/Niven, One Second After, Earth Abides, The Road by Cormac Mccarthy, etc. this book was a HUGE letdown. First of all, the author should not have written a novel. He should have written a survival book and left it at that. His writing was sometimes childish, boring and way too descriptive on firearms, tactics and what ifs. His characters never gained any personality and were shallow and boring. His scenarios were very hard to believe and bordered on the ridiculous!"
2,Ok book for Beginners,This book is ok for new preppers but not much help for advanced. Allot of the gear the author speaks of is way out of reach of a normal prepper or group or not feasible to own as it would cost a fortune. He does a fair job of describing the gear and its purpose. As far as the story goes it has some discrepancies in its time lines. It has to much religion in it and he assumes that the characters have the values of 18th century settlers. Even the people added later in the story talk as if they came from Amish town's. Overall the story is not to bad and it does have some value to teach new people about prepping gear and terms.
1,God Awful - Couldn't pick it back up,"I could go into detail here but just read the other 1 star reviews; it's all been said before.Instead of calling this a novel it should be a checklist - and free:""Here is what you should buy - in this size and this type and this is why and this is where I would buy it from this at this distributor in this city."" If you want to read this every time he mentions a piece of gear - you'll love this book. I was going to look for the ""sponsored by"" pages at the end of the book but never made it that far. The only reason this book didn't get turned into kindling; it that it was on my Kindle. It still almost went out the window. I returned it after torturing myself through 165 pages"
1,Reads like a Sears catalog,"Reads like a sears catalog, lots of pieces of information but realy not a good read as a story. The dialoge between the characters reads ike a ""c"" average high school kid wrote it. Poor writing skills by the author...."
3,"Great concept, not the best execution","If you're a survivalist this is a must read - it's a very literal and practical look at what could happen in the aftermath of the S hitting the F. Some very insightful and poignant points. But Rawles is clearly not the most gifted novelist. This is kind of like what the movie for Cormac Mccarthy's The Road would look like if it was made by the History Channel instead of John Hillcoat.This is an incredibly hard work of fiction to review since it doesn't fall neatly into any one category. It's kind of fictional game theory...a big ""what if"". Tempted to give it 4 stars but certain things were lazy....why include an entire chapter on the specifics of radio communications? Anyone who knows that stuff or want to know it can get details elsewhere. But the story and concept were great. Read The Road and then read this"
2,"If you're a sensible person, don't bother.","I love the survival/post-apocalyptic sub genre. On the Beach, The Postman, Dies the Fire... all great novels. This book, however, is not one of them. The only reason I even gave 2 stars was for the astounding amount of information packed into the book. The author clearly knows what he is talking about, but his literary prowess leaves something to the imagination. I got 100 pages into it and couldn't finish; it was boring and skewed with right-wing extremist propaganda. This book, by comparison, makes Fox News look like crazy free love hippies. You want a survivalist manual? Then buy a legitimate manual, not this."
2,Has some good information on stockpiling/preparing but overall not an interesting read at all.,Some good information but mostly a very boring read. And what's up with the lets hold everyone and anyone at gun point who just so happens to be travelling on a very public road that runs by the hideout. The writer makes negative references to the BATF but finds it perfectly OK to not only hold people at gunpoint on a public road but got through all the belongings and demand them explain their travel plans. Sounds like he'd fit right in with the BATF. About the only thing I found of value is the preparing and stockpiling part.
3,Very Mixed,"Would give this book four or perhaps even five stars for the large amount of very good potentially useful information it contains. However, the story and the writing is as dry as dust. There is no character development whatsoever and the characters exist only as props for the story which in turn serves only as a framework to demonstrate how the information might be useful to the reader in the event of some future societal and infrastructure breakdown (which I happen to believe is well within the realm of possiblity). Insofar as the information is concerned, I believe it is worthwhile but could be better presented and far better organized in a nonfiction reference book that would be very useful."
5,Just read it...,"What better way to learn survival skills and techniques than in the form of an exciting novel. This is great for the information, but even better for the mindset you adopt as you read. Best preparedness book, as it is not a textbook, not a recipe, not a procedural guide. It serves to develop your thought process to handle a crisis. And, the story is great, with good character development and EXCITEMENT. Excellent - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
3,Survival Guide,"Although this is a good novel about life after the apocalypsis, there is an excess of details. It is a modern version of Alas Babylon. In addition to being a novel, this is a survival guide which gives tips and specifics about equipment, food storage, communications, automobiles, etc. If you are a fan of ""survivalism"" or guns you will love this novel. You will find that the best handgun for self-protection will be the old reliable .45, that old cars without OBDII are the best for reliability and repair, that you can store wheat grain by using dry-ice, etc. The amount of detail is incredible. I will like to read more books from this writer."
1,Garbage,"This book is garbage. Underdeveloped characters that I cared nothing about even at the end of the story. Underdeveloped sub-plots that had nothing to do at all with the main plot and that were oddly interjected. Time lines jump all over, holes all over. I know what this book was going for: a how-to/novel. It fails as a how-to. It fails as a novel. It fails miserably at trying to be both."
1,GodAwful!,"There are some very good post apocalyptic novels out there: Alas Babylon, Earth Abides, Lucifer's Hammer . . . On the Beach. However, this ""book"" is the singularly most Godawfully written book I have ever tried to read. It is BAD. Enough said."
2,Lunatic fringe,"A view of the coming financial and social collapse as seen from the lunatic fringe. The characters hold such main line opinions as the federal government has no jurisdiction in the states and driver's licenses are only legally required for commercial drivers. All of the positively positioned characters are devout christians...even the jewish ones.Anyone associated with the government, including the police, are portrayed as evil and incompetent.The main characters although described as middle class, were able to accumulate hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment and supplies before the crash. One couple was able to walk from Chicago to Idaho apparently carrying several hundred pounds of guns, ammunition and food.Certainly among the top 10 worst written books."
2,"Detailed information, sadly bound with poor characters and religion","I picked up this book thinking it would be an interesting ""what if"" scenario type story, with factual survival information backing up the characters actions. What I discovered was that despite the extremely in depth level of detail regarding gun models and supply products, the story itself was useless. The characters feel fake, their dialogue is consistently dull, and their actions mirror those of robots as opposed to real people. Compound that by the fact that every 3rd page a heaping serving of religion is force fed to you, and the book goes from passable to barely readable."
1,Sucks!!!!!!,"This book was the worst book I ever read. I'm not even finish with it but I had to say something. Even if he was trying to disguise ""prep tips"" in his book. He still missed the mark. The characters are empty. The tips are one dimensional. And the gun cataloging is crap. I like Mr. Rawles' tips on survival, hell even his site is awesome with great tips. But this book should be burned. TWICE!!!!!!!When I finish this book & get my senses back. I'll make a more in-depth review."
3,informative but far fetched,"First, i enjoyed the book and it opened my eyes to how fragile our society is and our reliance on ""technology"" and services/infrastructure. i am unwilling though to even consider dedicating the time, money and resources to a possible survival situation this book indirectly advocates. also, i think the author drastically overestimates how well ""regular"" citizens could do against a trained military force with armor and air support. not realistic."
2,Some good info but...,"There is some good info in this book, however, it is, for the lack of a better word, corny. For instance when one of the main characters gets shot multiple times and his intestines are hanging out of his body, he exclaims "" Oh Crud!"", how's that for realism. A lot of other things in the book are very unrealistic. This group is very concerned about having enough food and supplies, yet they give away a lot of it to strangers in need. A nice thought but not to realistic. This book also goes on and on and on in way too much detail about things such as the finer points of radio transmission and M1 tanks. The only reason I bought this book is because the author was on a local radio show and made this book sound fantastic. The only reason I read the whole thing is because I had $15 invested in it."
3,Could have used a better Editor,"The story needed more character development and plot progression and less time on weapons.Overall it was an interesting read, but not one that I feel compelled to pass along to friends as a ""must read""."
3,Not My Cup Of Tea,The author is passionate about his subject but the book reads like a 384 page after-action report...very boring and one-dimensional.
1,How did this happen?,"Nothing I can say that hasn't already been stated in other 1 star reviews. I'm an avid reader, reading at least 4 or 5 books a month. I rarely, if ever, don't finish a book I start. However, I made it about a quarter of the way through this rag before I had to put it down. This book is good for use as fire starting material or for lining the bottom of your birdcage, but other than that it has no value whatsoever."
3,Patroits:A Novel of Survival in the Coming Crash,"This book has some interesting scenarios and pretty good action. However when I purchased the book I thought it was about ""ordinary"" people surviving during a depression or collapse. It was actually about paramilitary groups and delt too much with military terms, guns, ammo, and calibers for my taste. Not a bad read if that is your interest but I would not have purchased it had I known."
3,Only for a already educated survivalist!,"When I first started reading this I must admit I almost gave up. The author uses so many details in this book it is almost too much and only the already informed survivalist will appreciate it. I consider myself pretty informed on the topic and while I appreciated many of the details some of it was just too much and made me skip over pages at a time. Overall, if you are already a expert survivalist you will probably enjoy this book like I did. If you know nothing about SHTF prepping, skip it."
4,Head for the Hills!,"A great ""Armageddon"" book as well as some very practical survival skill info. The sections on armament are only appealing to someone with military leanings and a lot of weapons knowledge. The chapters dealing with food, water, and issues of hyper/hypothermia are great. The chapters dealing with all-out military battles ala ""Mad Max"" scenarios, are unrealistic in view of current technology available to the powers that be. The section on preparing and cooking rat will definitely get your attention!"
1,"beware, its not a novel","this book came up as suggested reading after I had read William Fortschen's One Second After, so because I liked that, I gave this a try. Should've saved my money...First of all, there really isnt any story, the characters are so weak, so you cant call this a novel. Its so didactic, there isnt any build up of tension or excitement that would lead me to want to prepare for something, all it does is put me to sleep. The whole thing reads like : Oh, Jesus likes Swiss knives for skinning because they are the sharpest, and Joseph carries a revolver because that can easily be concealed, and Mary can transfuse blood and sew stitches in wounds"" and proceeds to tell you in several excruciating pages how she does it. Its just how it read to me, I had to put it down , couldnt finish it at allIf I wanted an instructional book on survival, I would have bought one. I wanted a novel that actually told a story"
2,To much manual for me!,"I really wanted to ""get into"" this book, but I just couldn't. I was interested in the idea of the story, but it really is a survival manual disguised in a story. From the first few pages it starts to get a little dry because it is so cluttered with ridiculously detailed specs on each and every gun the characters own, each item the people coming to Idaho brings, and every item in the Idaho compound. It begins to distract the reader from the actual story line. I also was unaware that religion would play such a large role in the story. Religion isn't really my thing so I found myself rolling my eyes a little. Anytime something happens they pray and what exactly they prayed for would be described. Overall I was not impressed. Great concept, not well executed."
2,It's an okay fiction read,"I picked up this book on recommendation from a friend, did not have any preconceived opinion from other Amazon reviews. The book is okay in terms of writing style, but it feels as though it was written by someone in the military. The author goes to great lengths to describe weapons, ammunition and tools but very little other details like the looks of the characters, the surroundings etc.My only huge complaint about the book is the massive focus on Christianity. It gets old real fast (by about chapter 2). Other than that, it's a good read overall and does suck you in if you're into survival/post-apocalyptic themes.*UPDATE* I just finished this book (review previously written early) and wow does it completely fall apart. By chapter 20 the book just jumps from topic to topic only covering small little glimpses. It's almost as if the editors dictated it be cut short. Feels rushed and written by high school kid that just wanted to finish up.It could have been a better book."
3,Patriots: Surviving the Coming Collapse,"This book earns 4 stars in the area of Disaster Preparedness, which is why I purchased it. I ranked it down for the feeling that the author was trying to press his religion on to the reader. It got to the point of peachiness and took away from the story. I did not buy the book to be told what my religious beliefs should be. That said, the book has a large amount of information on how to prepare for the social collapse type of disaster, tucked away nicely in to fiction. If it is your goal to get hints on the types of weapons and supplies you would want if this type of disaster were to occur, then this book does a real good job in that regard."
3,A dissapointment,"Previous reviews stated that this book could have used a better editor. I completely agree, the technical aspects were good but the literary quality left a lot to be desired. Some of the story lines didn't make any sense when you considered the stated SOP of the group. The Religious references weren't incorporated very well either seeming to be a bit elitist. I believe the concept was good but the execution was amateurish."
4,thought provoking,"If possible I would give this book 4 1/2 stars. Patriots is an interesting mix of genres. It's part novel, part instructional manual, and part political manifesto. It's bound to stir emotions and opinions and at the very least it will generate discussion. It should appeal to fans of post-apocalyptic fiction and anyone with even a curiosity in survivalism. The overt Religiousness was a bit glaring but I was able to overlook it and found Patriots to be a highly entertaining and informative book. You'll be thinking about it long after finishing it."
4,Good read,"If you are interested in survival techniques and have a basic knowledge of fire arms, this is a good novel about working together to liberate a world gone mad. I enjoyed the book and didn't find it too hard to follow even though I'm not that well read on types of firearms and the like. In our day and time it's not so terrible far fetched either and that is the really sad part. At least it has a positive ending, which is much more than I can say for ""The Road"" another apocalyptic novel."
5,Practical Scenario that I could not put down,"This is a novel that I could not put down. Although I just finished readingOne Second Aftertwo weeks ago, I found this novel more practical and facinating. A plausible scenario, the collapse of the economy and dollar, and the ensuing events appear to be not too far from our current reality.The index of the novel is very unique. It basically covers factual items,such as books, weapons, survial technology, housing, etc. Almost like an index to various survival checklists.What is very useful, is how the novel puts various survival strategies, tools, into a realistic context."
4,Rampant Mary Sue-ism but still a great read,"If you're interested in seeing how a well-planned survival scenario plays out in the context of an actual disaster, this is a great book. The heroes are more-or-less two-dimensional, but the survival teaching that undergirds the book is excellent.If you're looking for an enjoyable aesthetic reading experience, you may want to look elsewhere, but you will definitely benefit from this book if educating yourself on survival is your goal."
5,Patriots Surviving The Coming Collapse,"I wrote Mr. Rawles a letter to personally thank him for writting this book. I have read it several times and the last time I used a yellow highlighter to mark the really important stuff. The book is either a survival manual disguised as a novel, or a novel disguised as a survival manual! Either way you look at it, it is a darn good book. Once you start reading the book, you won't be able to put it down. The interesting thing about the book is that all the survival references (names & publications)in the book can be accessed on the web. I thought I was standardized as far as equipment is concerned. This book made me re-think everything from the ground up.Mr. Rawles has done a very excellent job of waking up America with this book.John Doe, (Name With held by Request)Nam Vet, Paratrooper, & Swashbuckler"
3,"Informative and fun, but no literary tour de force","Great book if you are interested in information on how to survive a societal collapse. Basically a guide on how to prepare prior to some sort of disaster, and what may happen afterwards.Not really a great novel, but it makes little pretense to be a great literary work. Heavy on technical details. Can still be read as a thriller type book.I enjoyed it and learned more than a few things that may come in handy if the worst happens."
3,it ain't great literature ...,"... but it's an entertaining read from what many would consider an extreme perspective. The challenge to create an entertaining story while providing detailed instructions is difficult. I think, for the most part, Rawles does a serviceable job of meeting both goals.The story was a bit disjointed. The radio/comm stuff near the end seemed to be forced in. I would have like to been kept ""up to date"" on the Matt Keane side of the story throughout the novel, instead of just at the beginning and the end. The main characters were a little too perfect ... flawed heroes are a little more interesting ... but I'm guessing character development wasn't high on the list of priorities.I liked it, and I plan on stealing the line, ""When the Schumer hit the fan"" ... ROFL"
2,Silly,"I bought this book after reading the other reviews on this site. The first half moves along and was hard to put down. After that, it degenerates into a bizarre scenario where the ``Patriots'' in the title are fighting to keep the United Nations from conquering Northern Idaho.Other folks may have found the book a valuable textbook, but unless you need to know how to brew up grenades capacble of ``taking out'' Bradley Fighting Vehicles and other tools of the New World Order, it's not that great.The book was really silly. Try ``Alas, Babylon'' instead."
3,environmentalist,"This book is very good but I suggest Mr. Rawles' book be tied in with a brand new true story on Amazon.com, There is Something in the Air by David Yarbrough. A chemical weapons enviromental tragedy of conspiracy, backstabbing, and eventually the story of imprisonment in a federal penetentiary."
2,Christian fiction,"Parts of this were quite good, and a lot of research went into it. For me however its was just too Christian to finish, if thats what you're into you will probably enjoy it."
2,"Decent Story, Jr. High school grade writing skills","Yes there is a story here and thats the redeeming part. Plus the plans and execution give one some solid ""how to"" ideas for your own preps. The big downer here is the basic lack of writing skills. They really dumb down the book and give it an ackward, oafish quality that it was written by a Jr. High student with limited writing, imagination, and vocabulary skills.So as long as you are reading it with low expectations of literary quality you will be fine. I'm not saying its not worth the read just that it is lacking in the level of quality that would make it a fine to excellant read."
2,Was okay read to about 1/2 way,"Then just goes down hill... Starts to go into too much lists/details and drags on and on... Kinda gets too ""corny"" for lack of a better word."
2,Patriot surviving the coming calapse,Interesting but it had a bit too much religious content for my liking. It was a little dry in the delivery and I don't think it shows a true representation of the possible events that will occur due to a Christian perspective which tends to discount the darker less cheery side to reality and has a certain bias as to how other participants respond which is incorrect. At least it does relate the facts that our present economy cannot continue and that anarchy and/or a police state is soon to follow.
1,This book was like twilight for conspiracy nuts,This book read like the masturbatory fantasy of a mentally challenged militia member.It was also awkwardly and inconsistently edited which made it even more painful to read.
2,poorly written but lots of info,"this book is poorly written. The grammer is fine but there are a ton of editing errors like periods at the ends of sentences havign no space after it. The time line was obviously rewritten to be updated but it was done so badly that it distracts from any kind of story telling.Frankly this book reads like a bunch of info the author wanted to get out so he crammed a story around it. I'm not saying the info is bad just that this should have been two differnt books. One with the information and one with the story. Its really too bad that all the exposition is crammed into this. It flattens the characters and makes them little more that cardboad cut outs, flat and boring."
2,Prepare for poor writing,"I think the editor must have been killed in the collapse, as he is nowhere to be found in this book. Seems very thrown together with almost no narritive flow.This book is great if you beleive the government is evil and planned 9/11, that the UN is planning on throwing conservative americans into concentration camps at the first oppurtunity, and that 10 guys with rifles can defeat entire mechanzied armies of raping, looting, dirty foreigners. Oh and it helps if you are a fundamentalist christian as this book was written by one obviously. About every paragraph contains them praying.Also large sections of the book are lists of what to buy, what to do, etc. Would have been much better as just a non fiction set of lists rather than the ""novel"" thats really just a hardcore-rightwing wetdream."
3,Manual with a lame story,"There are some good things to glean from this book. Don't get me wrong and it should be read, but don't be looking for a gripping story. It pretty much stinks in that way. I would rather have an indexed manual to cover the things in the book instead. It would be easier to reference. Not a total waste, but get it used and get a highlighter so you can mark the good stuff."
2,Way too many details!!!,"I think this book would have been much better if it had been cut in half. I skipped through as many as 5 or 6 pages at a time in some places and still didn't miss anything at all! The author over explains every weapon, battle, character, idea...the list goes on and on. This is the first review I have ever written, and I only did so because I don't think I've ever read anything as long winded as this book."
2,If you need a supply list,"Not too good. No plot just a detailed supply list. No character development or story. If looking for a ""survive the government"" supply list you will love this book."
2,"Decent concept, poor execution","The story was decent, but the editing and/writing is sub-par. All of the characters were one dimensional, and the author spent WAY too much time talking about minor details that added nothing to the story (they actually detracted). I'm giving it a 2 star review for an interesting base story and concept that was held back by poor writing and editing."
5,Eye opening vision of possible future.,If you're concerned about the direction this country is taking. You must read this book.
2,Trying to finish...,"The book would have been much better if the author would have added more story and less detail. If you added all the information about what the survivalists purchased, where they purchased it and what it cost it would most likley eliminate 2 chapters of the book that could have been used for more story!! There was a little helpful insight on some of the preps they had and made, but not enough to warrant me recommending that someone read this book. Im about 2/3rds complete and just trying to finish it so I can move to the next book on my list."
3,So so,"While there are some good parts to the book, the author sometimes gets way too bogged down in details. I really don't need or want a whole chapter explaining how radio transmission works. Ugh!"
3,Too much information,"It is a good read, but the drawn out overemphasized details of how every screw in the front door holds steel plates in place(for example) detracts from the story."
3,patriots,"This an okay book. The story line is easy to believe, but i have a hard time believing that these people are set up perfectly for everything. They just happen to have a guy who is Marine Corps Force Recon, an FFL, AN explosives expert, A master Mechanic, A nurse, A botonist. All the experts at what they do and need to survive. Plus the book reads more like a manual that a novel. these are the trucks to buy these are the radios to carry, these are the guns to buy. All in all the book is a little to technical but otherwise it is a good book."
5,A great read!,Overall the book was very interesting with lots of excitement. I particularly liked how it provided real world tips and tactics and integrated them into fiction.I heard there will be a sequel to this book and I can't wait to buy it when it comes out.
4,Musat Read For Preppers,"If you're a prepper or a survivalist and are trying to prepare as best you can, this is a must read. It's a bit 'over the top' and unbelievable in spots but the range of topics and the situations you may face are a real eye-opener. Buy It! Read It! Share It!"
1,"Terrible, Just Terrible","This is quite simply the worse book I have ever read. It is poorly written, poorly conceived of, and a so utterly implausible as to be laughable. The author, a well known survivalist online, cleary fancies his protagonists in the story as true patriots, fighting against the injustice of an overbearing world government threatening to take away their ""Freedom"", whatever that means. But the real irony here is: these neo-conservative, evangelical, anti-government, quasi military heroes end up being lawless vigilantes, cold blooded killers who justify their killing in the name of freedom, and miss the fact that they have merely replaced the system with their own brand of oppression. I could go on and on about how silly it is--I mean the only liberal in the book is portrayed as a communist cannibal--but it aint worth the time. The author has some solid emergency preparedness information throughout the book, but this is just cynical, fanciful, apocalyptic porn. Stay away."
4,Thoughtful review,"Books are read by vastly different audiences. I am an older retired physician, Christian and served in the military. The story is good, and has good moral values never mentioned in other apocalyptic books. Shooting the bad guys goes without saying, but how to treat others in distress is covered and the author guides us towards reasonable American virtues. He educates about what to bring to the disaster very thoroughly. This book has kicked me into gear, and I'm giving several to my friends for their consideration. Guess a book can't do much better than that."
2,Decent plot but reads more like a checklist,"I rarely write reviews, but this book had me so annoyed I had to let people know. For some reason, this book seems to be popular amongst 'preppers'...and after reading it, I can't figure why that would be. This book has a decent enough plot, but the author seems to want the reader to know how much knowledge he has regarding survival equipment. This becomes ridiculous after the first couple chapters. People just don't talk like the characters in this book, I typed on my HP keyboard while looking at my HP LE1901w monitor. See how annoying that is? That is all throughout this book. If you want a good book that puts 'ordinary' people in a survival scenario - read One Second After - possibly even Lights Out (although not necessarily well written, it is a good plot).Stay away from this book."
3,alrighty then...,"Narrative was pretty dry, packing a lot of information dressed as fiction. I've read short stories from high school students that had better flow. Timelines were obviously way off, obviously written in the 1990's, reprinted and updated to meet 2009. Lots of info obviously, but the author should probably stick to his blog. There was no character developement, one person was bland as the next in this story. plus, as with a lot of books in the survival genre, the bible thumping gets a little old. It seems that these authors think only deeply religious people can survive. All in all, read the book for the information, but take in the story with a grain of salt, hoping to be informed rather than entertained. taken in that light, it was an okay read."
4,A book that prepares you for a government collapse,"An interesting fictional story about a group of survivalists who must utilize thier skills to survive an economic collapse of the US. The story provides many details about preparing and dealing with such a situation. It is both a fictional story and a ""how to survive"" manual. Highly recommended reading considering our current weak economy."
2,Too churchy,"I found I knew a lot of the information presented in this book as someone fairly informed on survival practices in the first place.I learned a few new things about survival as well, however. The story is weak, as are the character creation and general narration. The information is interesting though. The thing that bugged me the most is the authors constant interjection of conservative christian beliefs and jargon. The militia in the book will let noone join their group that isn't a conservative christian, that seems very un-christian like to me. It just takes away from the rest of the book in my opinion, and gets annoying in it's repetition. Obviously this person is a survivalist and conservative christian first and a writer distant second."
4,Not So Bad,"It is a good beginning book for prepers and survivalists. It is more of a motivating read than a book that will teach a you a whole lot. I think that it was a good fiction that centers around one strategy in an economic collapse. It reads a little like a recipe and it is based on the authors thoughts and opinions of what might happen more than using real world examples. It gets a little fairy-taleish(12 people living in one house and for three years and no one ever disagrees) and rambles on in excruciating detail(almost quoting TM's and FM's). If you are a prior or current military member it might be tough to stick with. I like the author and I plan to buy more of his of his books. He knows a lot but I was hoping for more research and comparison with real world events. I will try more of his how-too books rather than his fiction. Final opinion, not a 3 but definitely not a 4. I gave him the benefit on the doubt."
2,Even better if you don't read the last 50 pages,"Pretty good read. The problem is the last part of the book where the ""new"" America is described. How unrealistic and naive considering that it is now 2010 and not 1810. The last bit almost ruins the book."
5,Patriots: Surviving the Coming Collapse,"One of the best books I have ever read. Very glad to have it in my collection, and recommend it highly to anyone, especially those who have concerns for America."
1,1 star review,"I consider myself well rounded and conservative in my personal and political views. This book is the first and hopefully only ebook I had to return before finishing it (less than 20%). It was highly insulting and I was more than offended with the author's theme and his ""tinhat"" conspiracy agenda. After reading some background about the author and visiting his web page blog (?) I hope this is his last attempt at writing, or at the very least, I hope for his sake he keeps his day job. I gave it 1 star because that's as low as the ratings system will allow me to go."
1,Utterly Terrible,"There are a good number of excellent one-star reviews of this book that outline the plethora of reasons that this is one of the worst novels ever written, so I am not going to rehash those details. Suffice to say, I had to stop reading this book in disgust after only about 100 pages or so. Since that time, I have gained much more enjoyment from reading the one-star reviews here on amazon than I did while reading the actual book. You will find a large number of short, unsubstantive 4 and 5 star reviews here which don't really tell us much about why the book is good. You will also find a not-insignifigant number of very detailed, well-reasoned and analyzed 1 and 2 star reviews - this observation alone illuminates the true nature of this book very well."
4,"Excellent detail, a real eye opener to what could happen.","If you are a fan of paramilitary, survivalism, or the self-sufficiency movement you will love this book. A realistic view of one groups realization and preparation for what could and may happen as we as world citizens continue to live as though nothing really bad could happen.The plot is skillfully woven with useful, and thought provoking details. I have marked many pages for future reference.This is obviously a reflection of the author's own lifestyle and preparations for what might come."
4,"Good story, plenty of good information",Enjoyed the book a great deal. Only complaint is that there is just too much christianity in it (IMHO anyways :) and I just can't see how the graphic descriptions of so many killings can get along with christianity the way it does in the book. I'd have to say the story is pretty realistic and generally good tho'. Recommended.
3,"Oh god, did you eat all this acid!?","This book is a mess, a complicated pile of out of date technical jargon, revenge fantasies and a casserole of random nonsense. Many plot points went nowhere, for instance the author is clearly a fan of the Steyr AUG rifle and it is often mentioned, but these rifles never actually effects the story.This book did wake me up to a wide variety of mistakes in my own writing, with some critical thinking it could be handy, certainly the food prepping stuff seemed solid."
1,A real stinker,"This book was a real stinker. The only entertaining passage in it was the ""Commie Cannibals"" and that was unintentional. I noticed many reviewers mentioned they got survival tips from this book. I suggest instead Rawles non-fiction bookHow to Survive the End of the World as We Know It: Tactics, Techniques, and Technologies for Uncertain Times. Judging from the negative reviews on his other two fiction novels, Rawles should stick to non-fiction."
5,Loved it!,"I forget how I came upon this novel but I liked it so much I've purchased 3 copies and given them as gifts and recommended the book to others. They have enjoyed it so much they get the next 2 books in the series as well and can't put them down! I know I couldn't! I especially like the Morals that come up in his books. If you have a prepper in your life get all 3 books and peace meal them out to them for several gifts, they will be thrilled!"
3,Not bad but...,"I liked the story and plausability of the trigger event. With that said, the book was far too technical and the religious views were far too pushy. Had he toned this down a bit I would have ranked it higher. I've read this and many others. I would suggest you read it to see ways you can prepare yourself for mass events."
1,"Sorry, This Book Stinks","I don't have much more to add that hasn't already been said by other reviewers. I had high hopes for this book -- I thought it would be another ""One Second After"" or ""Alas, Babylon"". It's not.While I appreciated some of the survival ideas and lists/inventories, the actual story (it is supposed to be a novel) is simply awful. Totally forgettable one-dimensional characters, laughably wooden dialogue, implausibly ridiculous plot, etc.Another reviewer mentioned that the author is working on a straightforward handbook. I would be interested in that. But, please, no more *novels*."
5,Refreshing and Soul Satisfying,"Once every few years I read a treatise I actually appreciate.This offering is one of those few.I have read it 4 times so far and it will remain at the front of my bookcase.I have given it to several friends and they took the time to call and say ""Thank You!""I strongly suggest you try this one on for size!j"
4,Patriots,"Good read. Details on preparedness are valuable to anyone who does not want to be up the proverbial creek ""without a paddle."""
4,a good read,I read this book within 24 hours of getting it and I was mostly pleased. The detail was detailed but it did help in many ways to understand many things I had been reading on the web. The techie stuff on weapons and radios and miltary stuff was tuff for me. The American making people pay for their bad deeds and regaining the constitution was a plus for me....made me think of G Washington's vision. I would recommend this book for those who realize that the world is not a perfect place and America will suffer some loss because we forget what we ran from when this country started.....plus we just have ungrateful people who want power over their neighbors.
1,Awful,"Patriots by James Wesley, Rawles (what sort of an idiot puts a comma in his name?) is one of the worst books I've ever read. The book is a thinly disguised collection of lists of ""what to have when the big one hits"" and the political ravings of the far right wing militia movement. Throw in lots of extreme fundamentalist Christianity, some hard core survivalist rhetoric, a time line that is internally and historically incorrect, and characters that come out of a poorly written comic book and you've got book that ought to win the prize for the worst novel of the milennium."
2,Patriots,The book gets going quickly and then sputters too frequently. The book is redundant. Probably a good book for some one just getting their head around all the unfortunate things happening in the world. The book is probably written on an 8 th grade level and is very predictable. Okay book to read when there is nothing better to do. Only 2.5 stars.
3,Mixed feelings,I had a major problem with one of the chapters of this book because to me it painted law enforcement in a negative manner. I would never recommend someone getting into a shoot-out with police and yet the author paints the characters in his book as hero's because they did. I figured this book was going to have a plot that did not try to brainwash me but thats exactly what it was trying to do. I did finish the book but overall I was disappointed in the idealogy of this author.
4,GF,"Good read and full of ""possible"" scenarios but please, ENOUGH of the religious flapping! I mean really, do you have to be a ""good"" christian in order to survive CWII??? I think not. Everyone that read and liked this book, I highly recommend a novel titled ""Lights Out"" by Halfast. It was released for free on the internet but it should soon be available in print. Much better depiction of the approaching end of times in America."
3,Somethimg of a disappointment - but then again...,"After all the hype surrounding this book, and the many positive reviews posted here, I started to read it with high hopes - that were quickly dashed. His writing style is pedantic, his characters all talk with the same voice, in the same way - and nobody really talks that way unless they are military and on a mission. Heavy going - especially with the religiosity angle. The ""gear freaks"" out there are going to love this book for its endless preoccupation with gear - here and there some interesting thouhghts, but I can just see some poor survivalist types endlessly debating whether they need 9mm or .45 pistols etc and missing the bigger point which he actually covers very well: TACTICAL AWARENESS at all times. In that regard this book has been invaluable - otherwise actually reading it was akin to being dragged along to watch someone elses kid perform in a school musical."
1,"Bored, Bored, Boring.","This book may appeal to people who want to constantly read compiled lists of equipment for a survival situation.This is not a novel nor is it a mockumentary in print, it is an excellent sleeping pill.The characters(if you can call them that,they have no character at all!)are wooden and have one dimension. The story is one of tedious explanation and mind numbing detail.I will admit i survived only 56% of the kindle version before i capitulated and surrended up to the emeny!The are a lot of great post apocalyptic books out there, this is not one of them."
1,I can't say enough bad things about it,"I'm not going into details as others have already done so here in 1STAR land (yes I know, there should be a NOSTAR rating.) Suffice it to say I've just burned this book in my fireplace fearing if I recycle it another might be subjected to the work of a completely talentless author. Characters & plot alike are stiff and lifeless as a 2x4. You'll notice the book is self-published, and granting there exist books rejected by publishers that merit publication, believe me this is not one of them. It has been rejected and deservedly so. So I advise caution. Try just reading a chapter or even a few paragraphs before purchase. It'll save you from getting burned like I and so many others did. Consider yourself warned!An illuminating example of how perfectly wretched books can wind up with good (4STAR) ratings."
4,A good start!,"My family couldn't believe it whenever they saw me reading this book, it's because they've never seen me read anything else but automechanic and home improvement books. I absolutely could not put this book down. Got me to do some much needed thinking for the long term. I'm not a survival nut but I do believe ""It's better to have it, than to need it and not have it"". Now my wife is reading it. She just had to know what kept me so interested in it."
1,"patriots surviving the coming collapse by james wesley, rawles","Nice, but not as good as some say it is. I own copy from will be selling mine. I am kind of disappointed."
1,LiberalandProud,"You should read this book to understand the mind of the Libertarian. They are nuts! This book has more descriptions of firearms than it does for the characters.On the interested side, it did have a section on every facet of their paranoia."
5,A gripping thriller!,This audio book was the best piece of fiction that I have listened too!It is a must read and a realistic view of what is about to come with the One World Order!
4,Character development is eh at best but an very interesting story on how to survive!,"Ok this book is good, not great. The great parts about this book are the comprehensive lists of how-to's and what-to-do's in the event of social/governmental collapse. A great preppers guide book. Don't buy this looking for great characters and indepth psychological musings. Buy this book because it lets your imagination run wild with what if's."
2,reads like a text book,this book is great if your into prepping and survival and just need ideas. DO NOT GET THIS BOOK FOR THE STORY! Reading this book is just like reading a list of what the author thinks you should do in an economic collapse.
2,well...,"It started out ok, but you can plainly see it has been updated and not very good. I like my fiction to be more real and believable."
2,couldn't finish the book because it's so boring,"I was hoping to read a good adventure story while learning about survival skills, but the story was just too boring. All the good guy/gal characters are alike, they have no personality except they are all good guys and they believe in god. I don't know how he can make the action scenes so boring. Overall I am very disappointed."
2,A bit dry and technical,"I was really excited to get this book, being a fan of post apocalyptic and zombie genres. the book starts out ok, but quickly turns into a technical read. The author spends more time explaining the technical or ""how to"" tasks that the characters do than actually developing the story and characters. It turns dry and become boring. If I want to learn how to dig a fighting position, I will read an Army manual. I am more than half way thru the book and just cant bring myself to finish it. It's that boring."
2,skip it,"Rawles is an excellent non-fiction writer and has a great blog/site...but this is a really awful novel, more like a weak attempt at stuffing prepping lists into novel form. The writing is stiff and awkward; remember how middle school kids read Shakespeare aloud in class?"
2,Depends what you want...,"If you are looking for a detail oriented book about survival products then this is for you.If you are looking for a lazy afternoon getting lost in a good book with a rich plot, you would be better off reading a dictionary.This is the first book I have ever read that I struggled with finishing."
5,Read it if you love freedom and refuse to be helpless!,"This is an excellent book. It is about standing up for what you believe in, having control over your life, and upholding America. This novel describes bad stuff in the near future, but in such a way that you can prepare for it now. You will probably find yourself writing things down or dog-earing many pages. If you don't want to have to go spend the night in a high school auditorium waiting in line for your spoonful of soup along with everyone else after a disaster, then read this book! It will give you a great start in preparing and acheiving the attitude to survive major disasters."
2,"Trying to be 2 things at once, fails at both","This book tries to be a novel and manual at the same time and fails at both.My problems with the book.10% of the text describes weapon specifications, it's just not interesting and doesn't add to the story.These people never run out of a vital item, they have bottomless cash to stock up. I would roughly estimate more than 60% of their income would have to be devoted to what they came up with. Also they never ran out of anything medical items or raw material for creating needed items, just happened to be on hand. The characters have no character or personality, when someone dies, you don't really care. Read ""One Second After"", by William R. Forstchen for a more realistic and story driven view of a modern PA event."
3,"Good info, horrible writing","The info is overall pretty good, if somewhat basic stuff. The writing itself is about at the level of a junior high language arts paper. Seriously. It's horrible writing. The author lets in a little bit of the ""Fiscally Conservative Christian"" BS opinionated prattle as well, but that's at least more tolerable than the writing.Buy the book as a sort of checklist of preparedness situations and gear... but don't necessarily expect anything to blow you away by being info you probably haven't heard somewhere before, if you're into survival and preparedness."
3,"Up and down, but interesting","I did enjoy this book.It's a pretty good treatment of likely scenarios and what life might be like after a breakdown of social order. There's much valuable information to be gained in the book, and for the first half of it or so, I found myself reading with a notepad at my side.As a novel, I don't think this would rate very highly. Many of the political concepts introduced later in the novel are well taken, but overwrought, and some of the dialogue seems contrived. It reads more like a ""how-to"" guide in many places than it does like a novel, or maybe as a novel it reads like one written by a survivalist and not a writer.I give the book 3 stars based on the interesting premise that was fleshed out well, and the value of the information contained within."
2,"PAINFUL to read... this is a series of shopping lists connected by a few sentences of dialogue or ""action.""","This book DOES have some value... there are a lot of details in this book regarding weapons, tactics, survival methods, even cooking different food in a pinch.And herein lies the problem; it's NOTHING but endless lists, with a little bit of other stuff to liven the banality of these lists.The lists cover, in excruciating detail, every bloody thing they do- the steel shutters, the LP/OP, preps taken on the vehicles before they make a trip, etc.It seem to me that I'm reading a series of recommended shopping-lists, with a few lines of dialogue or character action to act as filler between the shopping lists.I kid you not, this is the worst, most painful book I have EVER read... Keep in mind, I read a LOT of books, mainly of a technical or research nature. And honestly, I'm more entertained reading a poorly-written doctoral dissertation, than this book.Don't waste your money on this P.O.S."
4,Satisfying fantasy,"The book is a very satisfying fantasy of what ""could happen"" but never will. Liberals are so entrenched only a world-shaking cataclysm like this (or an incredible move of God) could ever change America's course. We are definitely going down for the count. But will we ever experience a miraculous recovery like this? Doubtful. But still, the fantasy is so well delivered by this author that you feel it could be possible. Truly satisfying! Very good book!Why rate it a 4 instead of 5? It is slow at times. But worth it!"
4,Fast paced apocalyptic novel,"I appreciate apocalyptic stories where the author gives practical info on how to prepare and protect yourself. ""Patriots"" did not fail me. Don't like guns or believe the US will always be a peace-loving nation? Then this book isn't for you. Want to find out what life might be like after the US fails to pay its' loans? Then you should read this book. ""Patriots"" is more of a rural view of things - if you want an urban example, try ""One Second After"". I recommend them both."
3,Not exactly what I expected,"This book was recommended by a friend. I was expecting more of a how to/practical guide on survival in the turbulent near future; instead it is a novel disguised as a survival book. It is however, a good read if you are into novels. I did learn a few things throughout the book but just not what I was counting on."
5,Nirvana,Good tips on items one should have. So jealous of the Shumer Hits the Fan property. Wish I had read this before Survivors.
4,Very timely,"Compelling story line with tons of useful information, even though this is fiction the situations in the story makes one think about the similarities to current events. Freedom and independence are timeless concepts."
5,A Must Read,Probably the most factual look at the current climate we live in and what we can and should do to prepare for the eventual disasters we may confront. Preppers unite!
5,Woke me up,This book started my undestanding of how unprepared I was for any type of disaster situation. Recent events prove that most Americans are not prepared for a disaster and this book blends in a great story with what basic items everyone should have on hand. You will enjoy the book and before you reach the end you will have started a must have list and thinking about buying a GOOD (get out of dodge) pack.
3,Just o.k.,Got too deeply into the discription of the weapons. This sceneiro is a real possibility in the VERY near future.
5,AMAZING,"I am not a reader by any means, but this book has been recommended numerous times on forums I visit. I couldn't put it down. I read it cover to cover in about 11 hours. BUY THIS BOOK"
5,Patriots - Great Book,Practical advice for survival preparation and also a compelling story. Highly recommend this book to preppers and those who are just looking for a good read.
2,SOPHMORIC DRIVEL,"I wanted to like this book but the charaters were so flat I couldn't tell any of them apart, There was some useful information which is why I gave it the second star . Unless you are a fan of unbelivable , EOTW sceanarios with a religous slant, stay far away..."
2,Not worth my time to read.,"I purchased this book, but stopped reading after a couple of chapters. It is a work of fiction and I found the characters to be unsympathetic. In other words, I did not care enough about the characters to continue to read of their experiences. Some aspects of the character profiles appeared to me to be more judgmental and ""nut-job"" than real people seeking to protect themselves from the tyranny of a collapsing society."
2,Pretty awful,"I'm surprised at how many great reviews this book received. It is one of the worst things I have ever read. There are some interesting tips but the story line and dialogue are awful.This is unrealistic (mostly), gun-nut fantasy land nonsense. The author also has zero real-world experience beyond his large-scale prepping lifestyle.If you want to learn something useful, read http://www.amazon.com/The-Modern-Survival-Manual-Surviving/dp/9870563457/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1335797174&sr;=8-1"
1,If only they had ZERO stars,Horrible book. Couldn't get through the third chapter. I can't imagine what people were thinking giving this 5 stars...? Poorly written and poorly structured. My brother gave me the book as a gift and couldn't return it fast enough.
4,More of a primer than novel,"The novel carries the reader from one scenario to another in a reasonable story. The story is interesting, though a bit cumbersome to read, and while any one part of the story is believable, the whole is a bit much. But those who worry about that are missing the main point.This book is more of a primer on how to do prepping than a novel The novel is just a device to NOT present you with a dull boring text book. The book is not boring. It is geared towards an audience with at least a minimal amount of understanding of military lifestyle and language, but can be read by anybody.The only real downside to this book is that some of the equipment mentioned beginning to become outdated, or just plain hard to find."
4,Patriots,"Good book, it will help push through some ideals that us as Americans need to take a long hard look at!"
4,Good Info,"Good information, delivered in an exciting & thought provoking story line. Sometimes a bit wordy in equipment desciptions. But may be useful to some people."
1,Too many characters,"Thisis the first book that bought by this author. I found his writing skills lack-luster. There are no indepth characters and too many to keep track of. In addition, it always seems that a new character would appear at just the right time. Too predictive and not worth following the plot, if there is one."
1,Repeat,"I was disappointed in Patriots and not worth the read or the cash. The first book 'Survivors' was generally a good book. Following up with 'Founders' was a great final for the two books. In fact, I enjoyed the turn at the end of Founders. However, to rename Survivors, change a few details, and call it a new book is sort of like repainting a car and changing the tires and saying its new. I quit reading Patriots after I started to recite the upcoming pages from Survivors. In fact, alot of the material just did not make sense like another person mentioned. I tell friends to read Survivors then Founders and just skip Patriots. I am afraid Rawles will rename Founders and change a few lines just to make money. He needs to concentrate on a new direction, maybe dive into the hispanic gang in detail or the farm family for an entire book. Don't rename a book and call it new."
1,I wanted to like it ...,"I really wanted to like this ""novel"". The SurvivalBlog website by the same author is excellent, but this book, not so much. As many others have noted, the characters are flat, emotionless, and undeveloped. For a much better story, read Lights Out online at FrugalSquirrels."
5,"3 Trillion, 6 Trillion? Funny Money and What Happens When Folks Think Money Grows on Trees...",James Rawles gave us what turns out to be an amazingly accurate look into how our government would proceed with destroying our country. Let us pray that he is wrong about the solution.If you are nervous about where this country is heading then this is the book for you. Get ready.
4,You should read this.,"Overall, a good book for those who want to prepare for possible government collapse. At times the book gets bogged in details of survival products or techniques, but the story stays together enough to make it worth the read."
5,Patriots,This is a superior book for anyone interested in protecting themselves and their family in the coming years. I have purchased several of these books for my family.
1,Bark Bark Woof Woof,"This is such a dog. Never before have I written a review where I could find nothing good to say about a book. It is a stinker.I am a gun owner and a Libertarian, I love survival books, I love end of civilization books. I should have loved this book.But the author has no talent and is a kook. For any of you ""mainstream"" people out there, Rawles is not representative of Libertarians or gun enthusiasts. He represents a very fringe element. He no more represents Libertarians than Louis Farrakhan represents Muslims. Nope, not at all."
1,Worst Survival Novel I have ever read.,"I like post-apocalytic novels, end of the world survival stuff.This one is terrible. If you are a deranged gun nut you might enjoy it.Endless specs about guns make for dry reading. Not a single likeable character in the whole book. If I was left to survive with these people I would kill myself."
1,Survivalist Wet Dream,I tend to enjoy post-apocalyptic movies and books just for the entertainment so I figured I should start reading something more practical that might have some actual realistic advice. This is not the book to get if that's what you're looking for. This book was clearly written as one man's fantasy with a completely un-realistic scope of the world. Not to mention the fact that the author has no real written skills or ability to develop a story. This is an amature attempt and a terrible story.
5,amazing,This book changed the way I look at the world. It was absolutely amazing. Fascinating and detailed enough to reference later for needed information.
4,Believable,"I received my book right after the collapse of IndyMac, which was I believe the largest or second largest bank collapse since the 80's. So reading this book at that time made it very plausable. As it starts out, inflation is out of control. Actually not too far off from where we are now. What I got from this book is some good survival tips that I have not seen in print anywhere else, things that I never would have thought of myself. I was going to pass this book on to family to read, but now I think I will add it to my existing survival library as a reference book instead of putting it in my fiction section."
5,Great book very realistic...,Great book with a lot of detail. It gives a realistic view of a possible outcome of hyperinflation.
5,Excellent Fiction mixed with real how-to. Would make a great movie!,"Great Book that tells a wonderfully American story about grit, determination and freedom. Plus it mixes in real how-to information into the dialogue to create a seamless, exciting story set in the todays thematic setting. Since the book was written several years ago the practical story line is spooky for its real world relevance in today's uncertain times. This is a must read for anyone who has the intellectual integrity to examine America's ""Just-in-time"" or Drive thru culture and its resulting vulnerabilities. I also appreciated the author's ability to paint a correct picture of the real American culture in our rural geographies which includes Faith, Honor and a Sense of Duty to the Constitution. NOT FOR LIBERALS-You don't have the emotional maturity to understand and learn from this book. Go back to your Latte's unless you can put aside your ideology and learn some real charcteristics of the Preparedness Paradigm."
3,Good Fictional Prepper Book,"This book is a good fictional tale of predictions surrounding the potential economic collapse and what steps need to be done to prepare an deal with a situation of the sort. Hopefully this would never happen, but the book brings up some very interesting points. I gave it 3 stars because it is not so well written as a fluid read. I think they could have proofed it a few more times."
3,Too much detail,"Enjoyed the book overall but it was just too much detail on the smallest things. Also, what I didn't like was the early version of the brothers and then not to come in until the end. The story should have ran in synch. Did not like that - pretty typical ""SHTF"" book and a solid read overall."
2,He should have written a textbook.,"While this book does contain a lot of good information on survival equipment and planning, the story is not done well. The characters are so underdeveloped that it was difficult to differentiate them while reading this book. The plot seems to be merely a framework for bragging about how wonderfully prepared for any eventuality the characters were. The information in this book would have been much more organized and easier to find and use if Mr. Rawles had simply written a textbook."
1,This book possibly written by a high-schooler?,"After hearing good things about this book, I decided to buy it and give it a shot. And I've got to warn you - it's really poorly written. I'm no writer, but I can tell when a hack who thinks he's more than that pushes something out before it's ready. It's almost like the writer is still in high school (or possibly just never went to college, or took any writing classes, or this is his/her first novel). Have you ever read a short story from a typical high school kid, with poorly developed characters, over-the-top descriptions, and almost no intrigue or plot. This is like that. A lot.If you want a very technical depiction of a bunch of people in Idaho, then you might like it okay. If you're a hard-core Christian ands like reading about similar types, you might like it okay. Otherwise, skip this book and go with something of literary quality, like World Made By Hand or The Road. Patriots is Not Good."
5,PATRIOTS UNITE,"Aside from the Holy Bible this is the only book that has literally changed the way I live! Anyone who has ever contemplated the collapse of our monetarily-run, dependant society needs to read this! It is unique in the way that it is a fictional novel as well as a survival guide. WARNING: Not for the faint of heart."
1,"So-so manual, horrible novel.","The author of the excellent survivalblog site should really stick to non-fiction. He's got a lot of useful tips and info to offer the world (which he generously gives away for free on the web), but I've seen teeth-jarring ""Mary Sue"" fanfic that shows more talent for storytelling than this ""novel"" does.I suspect a lot of reviewers are so blinded by the culture clash between the prepared and the ostrich set that they're inclined to give this book far more credit than it's due. But I'll say it here...just because you agree with a writer's political views (as I mostly do) doesn't mean you have to say he's a great novelist."
2,Patriots: Surviving The Coming Collapse,"I agree with a lot of the reviews that gave it 1-3 stars. Parts of the book were really good and other parts I just skipped over. It is classified as a novel but too much of it read like a survival manual. Too much detailed info on lists, guns, ammo, etc. If you are the Rambo type then you probably liked those parts.Too much Military lingo, sorry normal people don't speak in these terms. I do not have any desire to learn it either. Way too much religious stuff. Seemed to be saying if you have lots of guns, ammo, military tactics and pray every day then all will be fine.Many mistakes with dates and timelines. Although I appreciate the concepts, the overly religious and military stuff really turned me off. Who uses words like fornification? Maybe someone stuck in the 1800's. Hello, it's the 21st century. Get real. No wonder you have to live in the boonies with your click of people. You would not fit into reality 101."
5,teriffic,perfect amount of each ingredient to use as a supplement to your healthy way of life. I add a touch of honey and fruit to complete one serving as a meal. Leaves you feeling full for hours!
2,There has never been a more appropriate title.,"Readers who've enjoyed Suzanne Forester's prior books will be disappointed with this read. Readers who have sought out this book because of its BDSM side will also be disappointed with this read.As someone who typically enjoys Suzanne Foresters books and enjoys the less ""vanilla"" type of read, I was disappointed on both aspects. This book did nothing to assuage either hunger. Most scenes built the tension but quickly changed chapters before the follow through. It became so predictable that I wouldn't allow myself to get caught up in the anticipation because I knew there would be no payoff. The constant let down was the only thing this book delivered. The ending was very weak and like the rest of the book ended before the payoff. Take this readers advice, and look elsewhere for a worthy read."
1,"Amusing movies, wretched Blu-Ray","Each of these three films has its charms, and all three are entertaining in the nutty ways they have nothing to do with each other and often try to avoid showing werewolves at all to save a buck. Unfortunately this, ahem, ""Blu-Ray"" is just a terrible port of the old VHS-era masters and actually looks even worse; Part V is so dark, soft, and murky you can't tell what's happening most of the time. To add insult to injury, Part III is pan and scan, while the Elite DVD is letterboxed (and 16x9). If you have the DVDs (or even the VHS tapes), stick with those; there's no reason to pony up for this again."
2,A Blu-ray In Name Only,"Timeless Media Group usually does a decent job releasing some fairly interesting cut-rate DVD's. However, they definately need re-think their decision to start releasing titles in the Blu-ray format, as there's really nothing to add to the old video masters that make up most of their product.A Howling fan from way back, I knew this would most likely be pretty bad, but decided to take a slim chance anyway. Needless to say, it was the first time I've ever encountered a Blu-ray that wasn't at least marginally better than the DVD.I would suggest that one instead buy the widescreen Elite Entertainment disc of Howling III and the original (presumably out-of-print) Artisan double feature of Howling V and Howling VI. All three are, in terms of quality, way ahead of this drink coaster."
1,Disappointing,"This trilogy was really disappointing. It had poor acting, and less than impressive special effects. I had hoped it would have been more like the first Howling movie. Take my advise and save your money."
1,The Howling Trilogy,"Very disappointed. After seeing the first and second movie I thought these were going to be good. Since it's called THE HOWLING TRILOGY I thought it was movies 1-3, but no, its 3-5 (or 4-6, I can't remember). Anyway, the movies are cheap in quality and so are the CD cases. I think this is my first BAD purchase. I don't recommend this product."
3,Howling Trilogy,"3,5, and 6 are the movies included in this collection. Howling III & part 5 are good but part 6 is HORRIBLE. I mean, HORRIBLE. Part 4(separate order) is good while parts 1&2 are excellent. Part 7(separate order) is a Razzi award(awards for bad movies) nightmare. Part 7 is so bad I regret ordering it and I love vampire/werewolf movies. One thing about part 6 however that I find VERY interesting at the risk of a ""spoiler alert"" is that it is vampire(you read that right!) vs. werewolf way before Underworld was ever released. Very interesting indeed."
4,fantastic,The t.v. is great the only part that sucks is initial set up but the usb port is great and the built in dvd player is awesome...the picture looks great and no complaints
1,Don't be fooled,"This is not a ""The Roots"", the hip-hop group from Philly, recording. Just wanted to warn everyone..."
1,One of the Worst products i ever bought.,"It looks great in the picture, but the product itself is absolutely in need of revision. The Calculator and stopwatch function works seasonally, or when it's in mood. The clipper so loose and weak that paper just slips out. And the board has no rigidity. I think it's made in china and this one must've missed the quality checklist!!"
1,Terrible product.,"This clipboard is of very poor quality. When it arrived, the panel that absorbs light was loose and I had to manually put it back in place. Everything else is wobbly and the clip somethings fails to secure a sheet in place. Worst of all, the calculator function does not work. Something it does, but barely. You can only see the numbers for the calculator if you tilt the clipboard but even then it only shows fragments of each number. This product is definately not worth $15. You can get a better calculator and clipboard at a local dollar store. NOT RECOMMENDED."
3,"OK, but not industrial quality","Great all-in-one concept, but falls a bit short for the price. The calculator and timing functions work fine. The board has more flex to it than I would like. Setting date, time and alarms is not intuitive. There is no way to prevent the buttons from being depressed if you pack the clipboard for travel, so be prepared for date/time/alarm resets every time. The hourly chime is unnecessary and distracting.If the board were a bit sturdier and if a button cover were available (or perhaps an aluminum version), this would be a great product for the industrial workplace."
1,Piece of crap,"I should return this thing but it kinda works to hold paper. Key word, kinda. It came with no instructions and i cant for the life of me figure out how to set the clock on it. The calculator works but cant get the stop watch to come up. All the days of the week are lit up but the ""sun"" and ""fri"" icons are flashing. The screen is hard to read. The ruler on the side is really all that this thing is good for."
2,Clip and Time,"Not really impressed with this clipboard, thin cheap plastic, but then I got what I paid for. The stop watch and calculator is small and not intuitive to use."
2,not bad for the price,"it is a very nice clip board but it is to thin,other than that not bad for the price."
3,careless packing the item,"originally, the item is ok, but careless in packing caused some damages. The package was opened and half of the book got wet. Absolutely, I do not recommend this seller"
5,A superb text and frequent reference.,"While originally acquiring this text for a course in orbital mechanics, it has become a frequently referenced item on my bookshelf.If you work in satellite communications or need to quickly understand almost any spacecraft related concept, your solution can be found in SMAD. I highly reccomend this book for anyone getting into the field of spacecraft design or if you have been assigned a problem that requires knowledge of orbital maneuvers, cost estimation, mission operations, communications, or almost anything else.SMAD (as it has been entombed) is a gold standard general reference guide that has yet to be surpassed."
4,Excellent for mission design work,"Wertz has continued his good works, this time branching out with Larson from vehicle design (his book Attitude Determination & Control is considered a bible for NASA as well as contractor ACS engineers) to mission-oriented design. The scope is larger with emphasis on many example missions, so necessarily the technical detail is not as rich; but for ACS systems, definitely get his first one."
5,It Works,K&N build great products or I would not be using them. I have to maintain my 2004 Titan SE with good products 'cuz I can't afford to replace the truck.
5,A must for 2 by material,"I did not want to spend the extra money when I ordered this; however, I am glad I did. I how have it and have had a number of opportunities to us it. I believe the use of just the moisture meter would give me an answer, because this allows for deeper penetration, I believe the readings are more correct."
4,"Handy, affordable Bible","Small, light weight Bible written in the easy to read NIV version. The Scofield notes are full of wisdom and guidance to help with application and in gaining a real practical understanding of the truths of God's word. The bible also contains reference links, and some biblical maps. In a nutshell the bible is handy and affordable for both beginners and scholars alike."
4,Already paid for its self,Shortly after the purchase of the meter I had to determine an entry point of water around a window. This meter helped locate the source.
1,Not Pinless,"Entirely misleading. This unit DOES in fact have pins. Even at that, I couldn't get it to register on wood that I know was fairly green. Printing the return labels right now..."
5,Works as described,This moisture meter was able to give me the results that I needed for a reasonable price.
5,Very Handy tool to have,I needed to know how much moisture was in my logs on my house.I did not want to spend alot of money and I found this little gadget. It works great.
2,"Fair functionality, Disposable quality..","My device came from Amazon with a faulty probe connector, but I noticed the problem 2 months too late (after just a couple uses, but after taking readings with the device). Hopefully Sonin RMA can just send me a new probe cable as I used a continuity tester to diagnose the problem. Their performance remains to be seen..As a test I would hold the probe against conduit or metal ducting to make sure it is reading properly (needle @ 10, pegged to right), then move the probe connector to be sure that the connection is not intermittent. Also don't leave it on, or put it in a box where it can get turned on, it will chew through a 9V battery in a couple days no problem. A disapointment, even at this price..."
3,Moisture does what I needed it to do,I actually bought this moisture meter to check the moisture content in my fire wood. For that it seems to work well. I just wanted to make sure the the wood I was selecting to burn wasn't too wet. No Problems there.I do expect to be buying another moisture meter for the wood that I use for furniture building as this one would be useless for that.I am pleased with it for what it does. Just don't expect too much from it.
4,Good for Home Use,"Due to the improper instalation of a French Drain around my foundation, I was having a problem with water in my basement. I had the drain fixed, but I wanted to be able to monitor for signs that the water was coming back through the cyder block. This moisture detector has worked excellently for my purposes.It isn't great in terms of giving you a quantitative measurement of how much water is in a certaing surface- depending how hard you push the prongs into the surface, the reading will change. But for getting an idea of how well your drainage system is working, it is hard to beat this detector for the value. I gave this item four stars because I am sure that there are more accurate and rugged detectors out there, but given the price this detector is a 5 star value and a useful tool for the average do-it-yourselfer."
4,Moisture Test Meter,"I cut and saw my own wood, mostly oak for use in furniture building. The meter was very easy to use and gave me a fairly good range of % moisture content. I gave it 4 stars because it could be a little more accurate. But for the money, I felt this was a very good purchase."
1,Ignore the product description - this has PINS,"The product description talks about the ""contact probes"" and it is described as ""pinless"" but it has two big pins that you poke into things to measure moisture, leaving holes in your drywall."
5,This and all of his books are WONDERFUL!,Jim Carroll is the best poet in the world. I am completely in love with this dude. He rocks the charts.
3,Anthony Michael Hall SAVES THE DAY,"Poor old Mickey Rourke. This really is NOT a good film for him - well, to be more specific, this really is NOT a good film, period. But if you are even the slightest bit interested in or curious about Anthony Michael Hall, then put it on your must have list without delay.Those who remember him as the awkward skinny schoolboy in Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club, or as the mop-haired, sex-starved computer geek in Weird Science, may well be forgiven for not recognising him in this film - 6'2 and powerfully built, with a terrifying glint in his eyes that makes his portrayal of a murderous lunatic all the more compelling.Apart from that, the film is singularly unremarkable, with a desperately clichéd plot (I use the term advisedly) and a script that relies heavily on the F-word to flesh it out to any real proportions."
4,A must-read for parents,"As a parent of a 3-year-old and 1-year-old I felt this was a great book about how to communicate effectively with your children. While I was actually looking for more information on teaching my child to read, I gained a knowledge of how children learn to speak and how to have conversations with my son that will help him enhance his language skills, which are the basis of becoming a good reader. I thought the book was easy-to-read and a great resource for all parents. I didn't feel like the authors talked down to parents; in fact, many times she implied that parents were likely already using her suggestions without even realizing it. I found the book to be encouraging and informative."
4,Clever,"While the text tells a dry story of an ordinary school day in a young girl's life, the pictures tell a completely different story! Amanda descends her mountain-top bedroom by strapping on wings, bird helmet and claws and proceeds to fly down to breakfast; is driven to school by her elderly neighbor, a dinosaur; and meets the new girl at school, a space alien. Delightfully droll humor here with many jumping off points for conversations with children."
5,DO NOT miss this great book,"I spend a lot of time reading management books, probably because I am finishing an MBA program, but mainly because I find leadership, management, and professional development to be highly important factors to learn and act upon. I was EXTREMELY impressed and enriched by this book. It has lessons you may learn from experience but its link to Jewish sources and teachings made the reading experience unique and fulfilling. HIGHLY recommend it for anyone that is looking for a great non-technical management and leadership book."
1,New Recordings Of Pat's Hits Don't Cut It !!!,This collection highlights NEW recordings of many of Pat Boone's best known hits & I don't believe there is a single original recording among them. I am very dissatisfied with the contents of this CD & would not recommend its purchase to even a casual Pat Boone fan.
5,Great Tool,"This tool is invaluable for cross-cutting 4 x 8 sheets of plywood with your skil saw. It is solidly built and won't budge a micron once clamped over. I don't know what the guy from Florida was doing wrong, unless he got a defective one.Now, if I can just convince my wife to let me buy a few more in different sizes."
4,GOOD QUALITY,"These tools are well made and straight as can be.I do however have one complaint about them. They lack the ability to adjust the spring tension on the clamping mechanism. For the most part this is not an issue unless, you want to clamp thin plywood or any other thin materials. It will cause some material to buckle under the clamp pressure ( I learned the hard way). Besides that this is a great tool but, without the ability to adjust the clamping pressure it has a few limitations. As far as an edge guide or straight edge it's solid as a rock. Now get out there and clamp away."
2,Accuracy Problem,"I had the same problem as Mike stated in another review. I was trying to use it to line up a slick stick miter guide for a panel cutter and noticed the same 1/16"" to 1/8"" of play between itself and the aluminum extrusion. Not good enough for finish work. For finish work I too will keep my staight edge and clamps."
4,Rip Guide,"I purchased this tool to be a rip guide for my circular saw. It is easier to work with than trying to rip full sheets on my table saw. It works great as a rip guide, but you have to pay careful attention to make sure that it is square. Also, make sure it is tight or it will move."
3,unaccurate,"this thing is kinda wack, we got em at school in woodshop, i tried to use one to put a nice grove near the edge of my table with the router and the thing kept moving, its got a little play, like 1/8 im guessing, i was real close to ruining my project, since then i just stick to a straightedge, clamps and squares to make sure its all set up right as advised by my shop teacher.... also, the aluminum seems kinda light duty.. not to tough"
3,"Tru-Grip CT5C 50"" CLAMP-N-TOOL GUIDE. &OTHER SIZES","THE CLAMP IS PRETTY GOOD AS FAR AS PERFORMENCE.BUT I DO NOT SEE ANY REASON TO PAY ANY MORE THAN($) FOR THE LARGEST ONE.I HAVE SEEN & used one very much like this one except for the locking part was in a poor location & that cost ($) FOR ONE THAT WAS 4 FT. LONG, & I THINK ($) IS MORE THAN REASONABLE PRICE FOR THIS ONE. SO FOR THAT REASON ALONE I WILL NOT BUY ANYMORE.THE ONE I DID BUY WAS 2nd HAND.Now I'VE COME TO A POINT WHERE I COULD USE TWO MORE OF THEM, BUT NOT FOR THAT PRICE."
3,A Cut above some Films,"The main strength is the acting and the interaction between the two leads - Matthau and Dern. Unfortunately the actions of the main criminal are a bit far-fetched, i.e. committing the initial crime: Not a real good reason for doing what he did; and then later, attempting to do it again. I don't know what was kept from the original material. It's an interesting time killer."
2,I'm not laughing,This movie starts with a bang (or lots of bangs) but bogs down when the shooting stops and the talking begins. Fails to maintain tension throughout.
3,Walter Matthau and Bruce Dern Track A Killer,"Walter Matthau's first truly dramatic role of the 1970s after his years in comedic fare, The Laughin Policemen, despite its title, is anything but humorous. Matthau and Bruce Dern are partners investigating a brutal massacre on a bus. Dern, as Matthau's young partner, displays edginess in his doubts about his older partner's hunches, but he listens, and Matthau's hunches prove correct. Dern's performance is good, but constantly getting in the way is his mustache, what has to be the gayest such in filmdom, a mustache that makes that of Ron Burgundy look restrained.A series of dead ends eventually leads to a pivotal clue, and the two cops' main suspect becomes a ""fruiter"" businessman whop was cleared of a murder several years earlier. Because he knows the suspect, Matthau knows how to get him to tip his hand, but he'd better hope Dern can keep up, as Matthau maneuvers to get himself cornered with the killer on a city bus."
4,You can enjoy this film more than once,"Walter Matthau is always worth watching. In this film, he is all serious business in an excellent dramatic performance.The story is from a Martin Beck book of the same name moved from Stockholm to California.The change of location did not change the hard gritty and violent story.Bruce Dern and Lou Gosset are the best-known actors in an outstanding cast.This film has no false notes, intelligent dialog, fine acting and a good story."
3,Book is a mix of good and bad,"The book is a collection of short vignettes about a midewest town. Overall I gave the book a 3, but it's really a mix of some perfectly awful stories (1 star), some heartwarming stories through a child's eyes (3 and 4 stars) and some hilarious stories that'll split your sides (5 stars).I never did find the most famous quote from Lake Wobegon: namely that all the children there are above average. If you find it, please email me at asalwin@juno.com with its whereabouts."
5,"Years later, I still can't put it down","I've read this book so many times I've worn the covers off. Keillor has a gift for making the characters familiar and the scenes memorable. It's not only incredibly humorous, but also a poignant look at a slice of life quite similar to our own."
1,Yikes,"O.K. maybe I am just not intelligent enough to ""get"" this book. I enjoy listening to his radio program so I thought I would give this book a go. I was hoping that it would be sort of like my favorite author's work which is Jean Sheppard. I thought that it had all the makings with a funny individual writing a book about how boring it was to grow up in a little weird town. This book disappointed me in many ways. The main disappointment was the complete lack of laughs. Also this book has no rhyme or reason it just goes on and on about how the town came to be with little stories written about random people. I hate to ever blast books on here but I feel that this book just came up short in every way."
5,The History of Lake Wobegone,A much needed guide to the world of Lake Wobegone told as if you were visiting the Lake Wobegone Historical Society and greeted by an overachieving historian who doesn't get out much. The stories are hilarious from the first missionaries to the territory in the early 1800's to the later arrival of the first Norwegians. It unravels the family histories that contribute so much to the rich tapestry of Lake Wobegone and to the stories that seem so real.
2,Derivative drivel.,"After having heard Prairie Home Companion on the radio for years, I had hopes for this book.Right away it was obvious this volume is derivative of some other greater works of the author. It's like the rejected portions of the greater works were compiled herein.I kept losing focus and whichever page I turned to, I felt like I had not read it yet, at the same time as feeling that perhaps I had read it but must not have been paying attention. After a while, I stopped caring, and gave the book away without finishing it - this is rare for me to give up.Even paragraph to paragraph, there is no continuity or connection. Forget chapter to chapter progression. It's a real hodgepodge of fragments. What a rip off.On the other hand, I highly, highly recommend Love Me."
2,Didn't meet my expectations,"I've heard so much about this book, I was really looking forward to reading it. While there were some amusing tidbits, it wasn't nearly as funny as I had been led to expect. I also grew up in a small rural community and so I could identify with the location and the people, and much of the book rang true. However, given its reputation as a funny book, it left me feeling disappointed."
1,like wading through molasses,"A friend of mine and I have very similar tastes in books, so when he recommended I read the Lake Wobegon series I didn't hestiate to get the books. Big mistake!!! I couldn't even finish Lake Wobegon Days. I found the writing tedious and well, boring. I kept wondering when we were going to get through all the history and get to the story, or maybe that was the story. Either way it definetly wasn't for me. I rarely never finish a book I started but with this book I just couldn't go on. There seemed to be no real story except for people coming and going from a town that seemed to be barely surviving. I took the book on a 14 hour flight and read all of 2 pages, I just couldn't cope and wondered how I got through half the book in the first place. The best thing I did was put down the book, and begin reading something a lot more pleasant."
1,Could not finish.,I had heard the title of this book so many times growing up I thought it must be good. My copy I picked up at the used bookstore says #1 National Bestseller on it. Generally when reading a book I will give it 50 pages. If I can't get into it in 50 I quit. This has only happened maybe 2 other times in my years of reading. I am 30 and an avid reader. Lake Wobegon was grating at my nerves from page 1. I could not get into it. I was on a long trip and forced myself to read to page 77 and then could stand it no further. I found it boring beyond belief.
2,A Bore,"A friend borrowed this book to me. I tried to read it. I could not finish it. I can see why some people would like this book but I am not one of those people, I guess. This is only my opinion but I think this book is a bore. Get Population:485 by Michael Perry instead.I like Keillor's voice a lot beter than this book."
3,"Amusing to read, but does it lead to somewhere?","Plenty of quirky stories to read in this novel, but I am not sure of what the author is trying to say. It is apparent that the inhabitants of Lake Wobegon are interesting and eccentric characters shaped by religion and appears near-insane to the kids. Keillor writes solely about this town and its stories and includes himself in some as well. According to the ending, I can see religion plays a big part in their lives, but I don't know specifically what part. The author reveals just enough, but not satisfactorily enough for a meatier story."
1,incredibly boring,"when I had to choose a book to read for my high school english class, this one looked like a good one, considering I live in a town comparable to lake wobegon. unfortunately, by page 10, i was wondering how i was going to get through it. i found this book to be a long, boring, waste of time. i was forced to finish reading it, but i hated every moment of it. i wouldn't recommend this to anybody."
1,Slow and disappointing,"This book came highly recommended from a friend who knows me well. I really wanted to like it. I really wanted to push through. I've enjoyed Garrison Keillor on the radio.Why did I struggle? I don't know. I am an avoid and voracious reader, but I couldn't get past 6 pages in 3 readings. I blamed myself for the first 2 attempts, but I blamed the author after the 3rd and pitched the book. Just too slow."
2,price gouged and unhappy,"You can buy this book from the author's website for $10 --I paid $42 & quite frankly feel very cheated--I do not feel the need to recoup my loss of over $30 by selling it and I dont understand why all these others are gouging prices of over $60--it is NOT out of print or rare--plus any copy machine could duplicate what i got--its not what i would call a paperback --its actually that plastic binder type spine--thing--similar to a training manual--not really a book per se--claims to be published in canada--i like the authors and their website--hope you dont pay too much too,,,,"
1,Slapdash and poorly researched.,"This pamphlet suffers from a lack of serious and objective research. There are no footnotes, and besides the conclusion that the Templars became in essence the Swiss bankers, the authors offer nothing that hasn't been printed recently in much more exhaustively researched books. The whole procedure is to make an assumption, no matter how farfetched and unsubstantiated, and on the next page present it as a proven fact beyond dispute. I wonder whether the other reviewers have ever read a serious book on the Templars before."
2,a thin and shallow pastiche of speculation,Needless to say I wouldn't recommend anyone else waste their time on it.
1,research free zone,"This pamphlet suffers from a lack of serious and objective research.

1,Not What I Hoped For,"Very disappointed. Boring reputition for long periods of time. Try to find and listen to the tracks of these albums. Perhaps another artist will be easier to enjoy ""Medition"" music."
