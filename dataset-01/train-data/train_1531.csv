4,Great Keyboard Grooves,"If you like Keiko Matsui, Hiroko Kokubu or Bob Mamet there is a strong chance you will enjoy this. Whilst not exploring any new territory it is an accomplished and satisfying musical experience from Rachel. Her rendition of Alanis Morissette's Head Over Feet is interesting and I look forward to her next release. She was recommended to me by a visitor to my website and I'm glad he did!"
3,Local Heroine,"We are pleased with Love is the Power, and appreciate the type of music Rachel has defined as jazzy hip-hop. We purchased the CD after seeing Rachel and the band perform in her home town of Denville, NJ. The selections are good to relax with."
1,Don't Do It,"I recently saw Rachel Z perform on BET and she was pretty good. So based on what I heard I bought her CD and I was really dissapointed. I expected to hear some traditional trio style jazz but got this really tired contemporary, beat machine style stuff. I was so mad that I wasted my money on this CD I threw the CD cover and all, off the side of the highway. This will teach me to purchase something without coming here first to sample it."
3,"Part guide, part memoir?",I think I had high expectations for this book. It was a fun to read about the couple's adventures but the book didn't include the depth of information I was looking for. Sometimes the level of detail varied from destination to destination in a rather frustrating way. It's fun for ideas but didn't live up to my expectations.
3,Good but you can do better...,"...researching on your own. I bought this book because I'm a travel agent, want to evetually get marrried away, and am always interested in what others suggest to clients.Honestly, I found the book an ""ok"" source of info. Sadly, I ended up wondering where the couple involved in the book would get married next and what they would wear.I am not opposed to destination wedding guidebooks, but this one could be a bit more interesting."
1,"Starts well, meanders into blandness.","Bryan Brown is a special effects man who is caught up in a government conspiracy after a major mishap. This ""high-tech"" thriller begins fairly well before falling apart with badly choreographed action scenes, predictable twists, and a very underwhelming finale.* 1/2 out of *****"
3,"Great movie, but a really poor transfer from MGM","Kind of surprising that such a popular and entertaining film, with a good cast, clever story and fun effects, is givin such a poor transfer. It seems to be from the old laser disc. The picture is flat and murky and to me looks much like the VHS copy I had already owend. Again, a really fun entertaining film, but don't expect normal DVD quality on this one."
3,It Worked Too Well!,"I finally got too see this, after my friends recommendations. Liked it a lot. Very well done, if you like the mechanical, special effects things!Perhaps, just maybe it could have been made more realistic. By having the hero having problems with his setups, and then repairing them. Instead of everything seeming to work great. Implausible to anyone whose tinkered with gear like that."
2,"Plot, plot, and then more plot","A very intricate, involved thriller about a special effects man, an expert in disguise, and a plan to fake the death of a mafia kingpin who is about to talk to the authorities. All kinds of double dealings are going on here; in fact, so much story is going on with so little attention to character development that after it's over it all quickly begins to evaporate from your memory. Quickly forgettable. Bill Conti wrote the music, which is interesting."
4,Decent movie,"Although an older movie ('80s), is worth watching if one likes plot twists and ""brain over brawn"" type story lines."
3,"Superficial, but readable","Anyone interested in the Iran-Contra issue should have read this book. But the title, is a bit misleading. Woodward focuses too much on the Iran-Contra issue (and superficially at that) to the detriment of other CIA and DoD paramilitary/covert activities during the era of the 80s.Furthermore, the way Woodward wove himself into the storyline would lead one to believe that he was a key character in the whole Casey-era saga. Fortunately, this is hardly the case.Nevertheless, the book is a good review of the key players at the macro-level who were creating policy. Of note, the interaction between Goldwater and Casey is enlightening.If you really want to get to the meat of CIA/DoD secret activities during this era, Steve Emerson's ""Secret Warriors"" will provide far more insight into the covert activities of the 80s."
4,Ivy Balls...The Depths of Real-Life Espionage,"...Okay, so it's Operation ""Ivy Bells""...I just wanted to relay an abbreviated connotation into the title, in a nutshell.Specifically covering past espionage operations, this book relates excellent past internal working and policy decision making between various intelligence agencies, political players and other intelligence sources, not just the CIA. It covers specific, proven events...in great detail.You can get an in-depth idea of how ""shadow systems"" work around, and with, existing civilian and government markets, as well as DC politics that are often involved in big business and major political entities world-wide.I find it a very informative book, especially with its ""hindsight"" into deeper inner workings of not just what policy IS, but HOW policy is CARRIED OUT in the real world, and the not so visible world.An eye opener...well written, as to simultaneously inform and entertain."
4,Definately Not Bad.,"""Sometimes They Come Back"" is a wonderful movie if you're into ghosts. You get a definate feel for the actor's feelings and frustrations as he slowly sinks into what he believes to be madness. (After all, ghosts don't exist, right?) The end makes you wonder, would you really say no to the light?"
5,Just Amazing!,"This movie has to be one of the greatest film ever made. It's also amazing how well Adam Grossman directed this movie, since his version of ""Carnival Of Souls"" was terrible. And the acting by Alexis Arquette is amazing. He's really creepy. And just wait until you see the ""Tarot-card-death"". It looks real, and I think that's the only killing that has ever moved me in a way. See this movie today...you won't regret it."
5,Great Product,The Aiwa HP-EC3 Ear Clip Design Headphones are a great buy. They are great because two people can listen at the same time and you don't have to stick anything in your ear.
3,"Riding gloves, horses or a car","I don't ride horses, but these gloves are perfect for driving a car. Soft, good grip even though thin and light."
5,Very nice gloves,"I got these for my daughter who is competing at horse shows. They are extremely nice, fit great, she loves them. For the price, I highly recommend them."
3,Better than no mold at all,"The mold seems a bit flimsy, and mine came with a small hole and small crack, which didn't affect its usefulness. I was somewhat upset it came that way, but the cost of sending it back wasn't worth it. When pouring hard rock candy into the mold, make sure you come just short of filling each cavity; this allows the candy to drop out nicely when cooled. I would feel better if the mold were less flimsy to the touch, but it appears that it will hold up well with occasional use. The price is certainly fair. I purchased two more molds, because one mold is not large enough to hold my candy recipe, and I wanted a spare mold. If you are making occasional candy treats for yourself, family or friends, these molds should hold up well over time. They are great, considering the price. I am not in the candy business, so they work fine for me."
1,Huge disappointment,"This vice didn't even last six months. One day I was tightening down on a piece of wood when the main screw jumped a thread and my piece of wood fell on the floor. I tried again but the vice would get half-tight and then release abruptly. I unmounted the vice from my bench top and examined it and very quickly found the problem. The proper functioning of the quick release mechanism depended on a stamped out piece of thin metal that was clearly not up to the job. I have another quick release vice that I have been using for 25 years with no problem. This Shop Fox vice, ill-made in China, was not worth a quarter of what I paid for it."
5,These Vise's Are Very Wll Made.,I got the 7&9 inch Fox Wood Vise's for my son and his newly made work bench will be very happy to have these. Me and my son recenly went toa tool store that had alod of the Fox Tools and Machinery and they alllooked well made.
4,Glossed Over Wi-Fi,"It is disappointing that, after spending HUNDREDS of dollars on a new Palm, no printed manual is included. How to Do Everything with Your Palm is what Palm should have included with their products. This book is a good read for the first-time Palm owner and offers some new tricks for the experienced user.Although the cover of the book mentions wireless and shows a Tungsten C very little is written about Wi-Fi - one of the things that drew me to buy this book.Overall, Dave Johnson and Rick Broida have done a fine job here. They have presented their material in a logical and well-written manner while having a little fun along the way."
5,Sweet Voice,"Like many others, I first discovered Nana by chance while flipping through the radio channels looking for songs to listen to. I happened to come across a song so achingly beautiful that I was completely mesmerized by that stunning voice and unique vocal styling. I called the radio station to inquire the details of who this was. The song was called ""Even Now"" by Nana Mouskouri and that began my love affair with this incredible artist. I bought that recording on cassette and later on CD, and then again as part of her 17-CD English box set. Roses & Sunshine was certified double-platinum in Canada when it was originally released in 1979 and it sounds as good today as it did back then. Timeless voice!"
5,Excellent collection of old songs,"This is an excellent collection of old Nana Mouskouri songs. There are 4 absolutely fantastic songs which areRoses Love SunshineSweet Surrender (originally by John Denver)Nickels and DimesEven Nowbut all the other songs are pretty good too. If you are a fan of Nana Mouskouri, I would highly recommend this album. Buy it soon before it becomes unavailable and you are forced to pay a crazy sum on Ebay."
2,"IMHO,not worthy album","I can't say really something bad about this album but I also can't say I was ""moved"" by any of the songs there as by other albums.It simply bored me.That's all."
2,"Explanations - Mediocre, Problems - Impossible","I have used this book for Circuit Theory I & II in college and I find the questions in the book VERY difficult. Many times, the solutions require a page full of calculations to derive one answer in chapter 2 (KVL)! In addition, the authors do not make any effort to gradually increase the problem's difficulty level, they simply make all their problems difficult. This is frustrating for students learning new concepts, because excercises are meant to reinforce what you have learned.Unless you have prior knowledge of circuit theory, do not purchase this book. The book is only good if you want to sharpen your existing circuit theory skills."
3,Good...,"I bought this item as a gift and while the delivery was pretty quick, I didn't realize the latch hook tool was not included. Bummer. Wish it would have said it, and if it did, I wish it would have been more apparent. Gave it to a little girl for her 6th birthday with no tool. Worse than giving an electronic gift with no batteries..."
3,Beware of Colors,"This is an adorable picture, but when I opened it to discover numerous colors with a slight variation I had to resort to counting the strads to see what color was which. It says on the guide one color is orange turns out is really pink. Be careful when putting together or else you may discover what you thought was one color was really another color."
4,Fun and simple to do...,"This latch hook was fun, and only took a couple days to complete. I didn't particularly like the design because I thought it was a bit too simple and plain. It would be great for beginners and children though, because it's small and easy to complete."
2,where is it,I thought for sure this came with the latch hook needed to do this project and it did not...where is it?
4,"Cute, fun, no hook included, lots of shades!","I gave this to my 6-year-old daughter for Christmas and luckily did catch that there wasn't a hook included, so was able to add that to my order. Even with the hook though, this was a little too much for my girl. She needed more help than expected. Now that she's 7 going on 8, it's perfect. I don't know if there's enough yarn yet, as another reviewer mentioned. We're only about an 1/8 through this kit. When I was a kid I had a Holly Hobbie latch hook kit that I still hadn't finished by the time I turned 18 and moved out of the house, so maybe this will be the same deal. We'll see!There are a lot of colors on this butterfly and it can be hard to see where to place each one, but if you're not too OCD and are okay with some blurry lines (it is yarn, after all, lots of forgiveness), then you should be fine with this.For now, it's a nice way to pass 15 or 20 minute blocks of time here and there."
1,No refund,This item was sent to the wrong address. I yet to receive a refund. I would not use this vendor again.
5,A wonderful Medieval romance.,"Allis of Montclair is a young woman struggling to run her family's castle and lands ever since her mother died and her father fell into the depths of despair. Overburdened with responsibility, she must be the lady of the manor and a mother to her younger brother and sister. To help her family, she is willing to enter into a loveless marriage to Rennick DeFrouchette, a man Allis does not care for at all -- until she meets Connor, a Welsh knight returning disgraced from the Crusades. Allis and Connor and instantly attracted to one another, and their feelings grow into love. When treachery threatens their happiness, Allis and Connor must fight to find a way to be together. This was one of the first adult historical romances I read, and I simply loved it. I'll definitely be reading more books by Margaret Moore, and more Medieval-set romances."
2,A very predictable romance,"This book had a great synopsis on the back which pulled me in. But after the first few chapters it got ""tiring"". About the 4th or 5th time I read about Conners reasons for disliking the King and why he was discraced and sent home from the Holy Lands I no longer cared.The story starts out showing the stuggle of a young woman who has had to grow up very fast and take on much of the rolls of both mother, father and nurse maid. He father it seems has never recovered from the death of her mother. She is town between doing what she thinks will save her brother and sister from hurt in that she will wed Rennick though he is a huge jerk.As the story unfolds there is intrigue, attempted overthrow of the King etc...The problem is there is to much repeat of information, and nothing that really hangs you onto the story I had predicted what was going to happen after the first mention of conspiracy.I would have to agree with the other reviewer who gave this book 2.5 stars."
3,"Interesting, but ...","This book commands interest at several points, but in the end doesn't come together as an integrated whole. It is a collection of former essays loosely linked by overlapping content, specifically the experience and achievement of German Jewish intellectuals and scientists during the first part of the century. The centerpiece is a description of the friendship between Albert Einstein and Fritz Haber, and the manner in which each attempted to come to terms with the rise of fascism in Germany. Also interesting are Stern's essay on the experience since reunification of former residents of East Germany, and the fate of Max Planck under the Nazis. Worth reading if you're a specialist, but in the end not biographical or focused enough."
1,I Hate This Mirror...Thinking of Contacting Fisher Price,"I bought this mirror because my son hates to ride in the car. I thought the lights and music would distract him. After about 1 minute of hearing this annoying lady sing, I have decided that I would really rather hear my son cry. It is far less irritating. The remote is completely useless because you have to press the button on the mirror in order for the remote to work. What genius engineered that? Also, it is to heavy and it folds in the center after being in place for about 15 minutes. Don't waste your money!!!"
1,Did not work,I bought this product as I was going on a long trip. I put the batteries in the mirror and it did not work. I put the batteries in the remote and it still did not work. All that would happen is that the little red light would flash and you couldn't even turn it off without taking out the batteries. WASTE OF MONEY!!
1,Buy another mirror,"I never write reviews but I had to for this because I am so irritated by it. Yes, the music is horrible, but I can deal with that. It's the fact that it will not stand up straight, no matter what I do. After a few weeks, you cant even see the pictures that light up because they are so far down below. My daughter liked it at first because of the lights (great for at night when she didn't like being in the dark). The remote might work if the thing wasnt so bowed! I've tried adjusting it, putting something in the back to make it stand straight - today I just lost it and vowed that I would write a review. So, the way that I've adjusted it, my daughter can see herself in the mirror and she gets amused by that, and I've just accepted that's all this thing will be good for. Wish I had read some reviews before I bought it!!!!!!"
4,the book serves its purpose,"The book shows how to correctly draw the character proportionately and using the correct stroke order, but it just has simplified characters."
2,Nothing Like Wasabi... Just Horseradish,I picked up a bottle of this Wasabi in my local Walmart store because I was astounded to see Wasabi on the shelves there. I thought maybe it'd be delicious on some kappa rolls I made at home with my Sushezi. It tasted awful. It does not taste like Wasabi. It tastes like American Horseradish. It doesn't taste good at all if you like Wasabi flavor. It is too oily tasting and not spicy enough.
4,Really Good Stuff,Your Tuna sandwiches will never be the same! I mainly use it to spice those up and I highly recommend this product.
4,OSU Jersey,I absolutely love the new jersey!! It was much more affordable than buying it in a local store.
3,Football jersey,I ordered a size medium and it was way too small. Sent item back at end of Sept and still have not been credited for return.
4,Keepsake Crime is a pleasure!,"I really liked this first book in her new series. It was wonderful to learn so much about Mardi Gras and New Orleans. I have been curious about scrap booking, so I must say that I was impressed how she combined instructions for doing it with a mystery in the mix. I think she has found a combination that works. I just bought the next book in the series tonite and can't wait to read it."
1,Disappointing,"I live in New Orleans and was eager to read a series set in my lovely home town. The characters are engaing and seem very real, however, all the details about my home town are WRONG. I do understand that some liscense is needed in order to accomodate plot - the mis-statements regarding the city in general, Mardi Gras in particular, and the social attitudes of the characters and speech patterns are so far from real as to belong in a science fiction novel rather than an satisfying puzzle with good characters and enough plot to keep you reading.Very disappointing."
2,Needs work,"This book had great images of New Orleans and lots of scrap booking ideas, but it was hard to get a good feel for her character. I spent most of the book thinking ""Why does this woman need to investigate a murder?"" She doesn't seem to have a knack for crime and does her sleuthing in a rather random way. At the end of the book we're presented with an ending that just kind of appears, conveniently. It jumps around from little episode to little episode without really tying things together. I think it had a good premise, but I was not entirely satisfied with how it developed. I think the series has potential--but needs work."
3,Good for scrapbookers,"Carmela Bertrand opens a scrapbooking store in New Orleans after her husband Shamus unceremoniously leaves her. She enjoys working with her customers and tries to keep a stiff upper lip by staying involved with her friends and the community. As always, she looks forward to Mardi Gras and she attends one of the parades which takes a frightening turn when one of the participants is murdered. Shamus seems to have had motive and opportunity so the police zero in on him as their #1 suspect. Despite the hurt she has suffered from Shamus, Carmela feels it is her duty to protect him by finding the real killer. She checks out people who might have had a problem with the victim, and finally she discovers the truth. This book has a few loose ends and doesn't do a very good job of explaining Carmela's feelings for Shamus, but all in all, it is a pleasant read."
3,Nice and easy,"I really enjoyed this book. It was an easy and cozy read, good for reading just before going to sleep. Also, I enjoyed reading a book taking place in a scrapbook setting and I loved the combination of plot with scrapbook tips and talk.However - the mystery part of the book is quite lacking. In the end, it feels like the author runs out of steam or space or both and just have to bring it all together on the last two pages - and it just doesn't work. I was left with a lot of questions and felt like she just left me hanging. She had some interesting plot twists that wasn't explored to the fullest or even explained in the end. It seems like the book would have benefitted from another draft - or a (better) editor.That being said - I still liked the book and will try to read the other two in the series. But I will mostly read them because of the scrapbook cozyness and not for the mystery."
3,Not compelling,"This is another series with a female heroine, only this time she owns a scrapbooking shop. In this, the first of the series, she has to help her estranged husband beat murder charges and what better way than finding clues in her customer's photos! I'll admit I grabbed it because of the scrapbooking theme and it is an OK read but not really well paced for a mystery, I like my pulse to speed up a bit when I am reading thrillers and that didn't happen. In fact, I could easily put it down mid-sentence and pick it up the next day. What is here isn't terrible, but it isn't compelling either and I won't be reading any further books in the series."
3,"Easy, light reading","Having read a lot of ""serious"" books lately, I found this to be a light and easy read. Being an avid scrapbooker myself, I was enthralled that a new series was based on scrapbooking. The beginning of the book was slow, as mentioned by other reviewers. And sometimes I felt like I was reading the script for a Hallmark Channel or TV Movie. But, it was enjoyable nonetheless. I wasn't expecting a literary masterpiece. The ending could have been a little more creative, but as other reviewers said, perhaps it was the fact that it was her first story in the series or that she was writing too many at one time. I learned a little more about New Orleans and Mardi Gras, so the author is well versed in that area. I'm hoping that next time the plot will be a little more interesting and the ending a little more creative. I will be reading the 2nd title soon - maybe on vacation at the beach."
2,Pass it up,"This book read more like a travel guide to New Orleans than a mystery. While the scrapbooking theme provides a feasible way to introduce characters and provides insight into this popular craft, the book doled out too much didactic info about Mardi Gras, the different parades, the names and locations of the popular bars and restuarants and the history of the city. If it had been presented in a casual by-the-way style, maybe I could be more tolerant, but 25% of the way through the tour, I began to wonder if the Louisiana Board of Tourism had commissioned the book. There was too much repetition--I remembered the colors of Mardi Gras after the first time I was told. The mystery wasn't engaging and the ending was flat. In fact, I leafed through the recipes at the end of the book hoping that there had been a mistake and that a beefed-up conclusion had printed out of order. No such luck."
3,"Slim Pickins, but I've Read Worse","I was pleasantly surprised with this book. I feared it would be a little too ""cutesy,"" especially with that awful cover. But I found Carmela, Childs' scrapbook store-owning protaganist, to have more of an edge to her than I expected.Still, the mystery was a little light, as other reviewers have mentioned, and there were some extraneous occurrences and absolutely strange goings-on, including characters (like Carmela's ex) who pop in for no apparent reason and then disappear again. But overall, Childs is a smooth writer who can, apparently, make a book from the slimmest of plots."
3,"OK, but.....","Childs' book has a lot of plusses: scrapbooking is ""different"" as a setting, N'Awlins was a good locale, story had a nice pace. However, it was cliche-ridden, repetitious description (how many times did I need to know that purple green + gold were Mardi Gras colors??) and every detail about New Orleans was explained, in detail. I have been in New Orleans for just one day, a few years ago, and I knew all these ""secrets"" (chicory coffee, gris-gris, krewes, Madame L, etc.) This book needs a little editing..."
4,2X Telephoto Lens for Sony HC96,"This product is perfectly fine. I took mine to Beijing, and got some great shots of Beach Volleyball, The Great Wall, Forbidden City, etc. If you need a telephoto lens, get it. (Don't forget to check B&H Video. They are in NY) -- Hobie"
2,Trite potboiler,Disappointed as other reviews were good (or were they blurbs?. Formulaic with no excitment. Soap opera with airplanes. In the parts I read the errors which authors who are not truely familiar with aviation make were already creeping in. I did not bother reading the whole book.
2,Product is Thin,"I have purchased Liquid Fence for years and this is the 1st time I've ordered the 2 1/2 gallon size. I found it to be alot thinner than what comes in the gallon size. I throughly mix it, but it still seems thinner.I haven't tested it's effectivness on the deer but it appears to be a thinned down version."
5,The BEST beginners shoulder rest available,"These little wonders are a perfect price point. They come in different heights, are easily available and most importantly, They WORK. Beginners find them very comfortable and it gives them a great start in learning how to find a perfect balance point. They also make them in different heights now. They squish into the cases easily enough and come in purple as well as black for performance. I have known some professionals who have used this and they rave on and on about something so simple that actually works! I too, have used them on occasion, and find them far superior to the other basic brands out there. If you are a player you know what I mean. I refer to it as, THE PURPLE SPONGE. They really are a genuis and great solution for a blend of squish, fit and support that's hard to beat."
4,Good Country Music,"Although, I have not had a chance to purchase this ablum, I knew from the first notes I heard of ""Legacy"" that this would be an album that this album would be a wonderful addition to my collection. With many country artists turning away from traditional sounding material, Neal Coty has chosen to stick with the traditional. The steel guitar and twang are enough to make you feel right at home, but it is not overkill. If you are looking for a traditional sounding country album, Neal Coty's ""Legacy"" is for you!"
4,Good edition to a Fortean Collection,"I'm always on the lookout for an excellent paranormal or Fortean type game. When I saw this one, and read the reviews, I gave it a chance. I wasn't disappointed. Beautiful graphics, eerie atmosphere and an engaging story all make it worth playing. My only complaint about it is the length. It's too short. Can't recall how long it took, but I would guess around 2 hours or so to finish. Maybe less. Still, the game is well worth having if you want a good eerie title for your collection. It isn't scary, and though some say you can die, I never did. If you get the walkthrough for it from GameFAQs, you'll complete the game in now time."
3,Not the greatest...,"The enjoyment factor of this game depends on how much you imagine yourself ""in"" the game. If you can imagine yourself walking around the actual environments, then the game might feel a bit spooky and you can appreciate it for what it's worth. If you can't see past some of the game's silliness, then you might not enjoy it too much.The game is a simple point-and-click game. Puzzles aren't too hard, and you can probably finish the game in one day. The graphics are pretty good, but I think they shouldv'e been better considering how long it took to install all the data on my computer. The story is, again, a bit silly, or ""cheesy"", but overall the game is a pretty good adventure. I I don't know if it is worth 20 bucks, but you can always resell it after you play it. :)"
5,"Barrow Hill, Curse Of The Ancient Circle",This is a great game that kept me on the edge of my seat great graphics all around spooky game.
4,great graphics,"I bought this game because of the other reviews I read. I was happy with the game, the graphics and sound is really great. It is not too hard of game play so you if your a SUPER gamer you will prob have it solved in a week. (if that) it is worth the time, and money most def. you get full access to roam and look everywhere. there are things you will have to read as you go along (notebooks) quite a bit actually, I don't care for too much of that, but it does not break the game for me. get it, buy it, you will like it."
4,Spookily Fun!,"I've played many of the adventure games (Syberia, Orient Express, etc) and this one was absolutely the most FUN. ""Fun"" is the keyword here. None of the puzzles required a degree in abstract philosophy... there are clues everywhere (take lots'a notes and print out the map). And the clues don't generally come up in sequence... so don't worry about finding things in the proper order. And there are distractions; they can be fun too. Though the graphics are minimally animated, they are very good... and ""creepy"" might describe them best. The music and the sound effects are perfect and kept me ""looking over my shoulder"". And... it is possible to get killed... although the game will simply start you back up just prior to your death.The endings (both- good and bad) were pretty anti-climactic, but the journey was worth the destination. All in all, this is, to date, the most FUN adventure quest I've ever played!"
4,"Simple technology, but fun!","The game is amazing in that it technically primitive by today's standards, but just us much fun as its more technologically advanced counterparts. The world is not true 3D, but rather a collection of images with some fading between them. However the images themselves and the sound track are so artfully done, the experience they create is on par with anything else out there. The story is very cohesive, intriguing and very nicely told. The puzzles are not too challenging, but were fine for me -- I have other things in my life I have to think hard about. This game was, fun, entertaining, but not tiresome."
1,Guess I'm crazy to hate this one too.....,"I have to say upfront that I hated this game! It's boring. It sounds like a much better story than it actually is. Most of the time, you're just wandering around trying to figure out just what the authors of this game are trying to get you to do. Some things are ridiculously easy, while others make little sense and and time-consuming and frustrating.The graphics are decent but rather dark throughout most of the game.You simply don't get 'involved' with this game. It doesn't hold your interest. It's the only game I've ever stopped playing because I didn't care how it ended.....it's that boring! Save your money."
1,Shameless,"I am a long time fan of adventure games, especially those of the horror variety. However, I have never, ever, played such a pathetic example of a ""game."" I understand this was a low-budget title, but the graphics, sound, acting, and pacing leads me to believe that this was some high schooler's senior project, on which I assume that they got an F."
3,"Entertaining, yet pointless!","I gave this game 3 stars because, although it was entertaining finding clues and such, the ending and goal/purpose of the game was not clear. The graphics were beautiful and so was the music but the storyline could use some help. I don't recommend buying this product for the full price, but rather borrowing it from someone else if you really want to play it."
4,Finished it in One Day................,"Me and my girlfriend spent all Sunday playing this game. We were hooked.The Good.Excellent graphics.Good Story.Fun to Play.The Bad.The Ending was weak.The monster should have chased the character throughout the game. Only shows up twice.Short gameOverall, not a bad way to spend a day. Better than Darkfall. If you want a Darker Myst type game with not as many puzzles, but more searching. This game should suit your tastes fine............."
5,Excellent Scanner with Mac OS X,"I'm delighted with this scanner and find that the software works well. I'm using OS10.3.2 without a hitch. I use the scanner for prints only, so I can't comment about scanning slides or film. The scanned images are sharp with excellent color rendition. The scanner integrates perfectly with iPhoto which is where my digitized images end up. If you're looking for a print scanner to use with Panther, this is a good choice."
2,"Nice Scanner, shame about the software","The Epson 2400 photo is a very nice scanner and is capable of producing excellent results. Unfortunately, that is where it stops. Like all Epson products it is let down by software. Quite simply the software does not work. The ""Smart Panel"" is about as stupid as you can get and crashes frequently in Windows XP, many of the push-button ""functions"" just will not work. Even in manual mode the dialogue boxes are difficult to follow and do not function as they should. The software assumes, for instance, that you have an Epson printer and does not provide facilities for any other printer. Quite bizarre. I have taken to using Photoshop import rather than the Epson software, it is faster, more efficient and, most of all, it works. In all honesty I cannot recommend this product unless you have alternative scanning software."
5,"Works with Windows, Linux","I've had no trouble getting this to work with Windows 98, 2000, or Linux. I've only had it for a week, but so far its done great at doing everything from copying my tax returns to scanning images. Scanning at the full quality and size that the scanner allows takes up lots of memory, but you never really need to do that, unless you're planning on making a photo-quality poster out of a piece of paper.Linux users - Epson actually provides a driver on their site. Even without this driver, SANE recognized the scanner in about five seconds, and xscanimage worked fine."
2,Negatives,"I am dispointed. The software is limited for scanning films. You cannot select a picture of a negative film, it wants to scan the whole 6 pictures. That's a lot of memory and most of all a lot of time wasted. I had a green background with some negatives that I can get rid of with a manual corrections with the driver, but each time I pre-scan it forgets about the settings and do it wrong again. You can't have it do automatic color corrections with corrected settings. Also each time you go back and forth between the driver and the picture viewing tool it will pre-scan even if you don't want to. At last and not the least it won't detect films greater than 35 mm. I had a lot of frustration with the software and I am goind to try something else."
2,NOT RECOMMENDED,"Controls and instructions for this scanner are awful, and mine developed a habit of quiting just as it was completing the scan! Epson support would never answer the phone. I am using Mac 10.4.3."
4,easy setup compat.with HP printer,"I read about this scanner and was a little concerned about it working with my printer HP932C. No problem, works great! It scans quickly. Just got it and loving it so far."
3,"OK Scanner, LOUSY software","The product info says it will scan medium format film, but the lousy software will only recognize up to a 4.5x6 cm negative/transparancy. Sice I use 6x7 cm format, this scanner is useless for this purpose. So far, I haven't been able to 'trick' the software into scanning a complete 6x7, nor have I had any luck using Photoshop to do this with this scanner. It would be so much better if Epson would just let the user select the area to be scanned, like HP does."
1,Stay away from this scanner,"Or use at your own risk. It took me a month to isolate problems after installing Crucial memory in the computer. Bought what EPSON recommended, the Belkin 2.0 card. It froze the EPSON Smart Panel. The essiscsi.dll dissapeared from the registry. The ecbteg.dll and ebpport.dll could not be found. The new SmartPanel and Twain driver from the epson.com does not work in Windows ME. Had to uninstall the Epson scanner, printer, belkin card, and clean registry with utility program. Then, reinstall one by one, take the new memory out to make it work at 72 dpi. The slide stuff does not work at all. A big major project and a waste of time. I will not buy any more Epson products any longer. Bad service support and response. Sorry, I thought this company had its act together. Not very happy with their service and products. Go somewhere else. Sorry, I can't recommend other scanner. That's all, folks."
1,Far from Perfection!,"What a nightmare! DO NOT BUY THIS SCANNER, especially if you are buying it as a replacement for a current scanner. The software being shipped with this product conflicts with previously installed scanner software (even if you've uninstalled the old scanners software). Technical support, which is NOT toll-free is awful. What's worse? When you go to the Epson website to download the current patch files for the bad software that was shipped, it doesn't work! This product is horrendous!"
5,Great with 35mm Slides,"I wanted to scan a large number of slides, specifically some slides for my mom for her for a christmas gift. I did extensive investigation into several scanners, including a scanner that was exclusively a slide and negative film scanner. I ended up choosing this Epson model and I have been extremely happy with it. It is very easy to use. On the manual setting, you can preview the slides and then alter their brightness and contrast before scanning them. I've set the image quality merely to 1200 dpi, and the images have come out with fantastic clarity and detail, and yet the bitmap file sizes are a reasonable 5MB (and for those folks who don't have great amounts of hard drive space available, compressed jpeg files are another option).The scanner has done a fine job of scanning regular prints as well."
2,You need lots of time to make this scanner work!,"I read the other reviews complaining about the Epson software, and figured those people just didn't know what they were doing. WRONG! They were right. Smart Panel does NOT work. The buttons on the scanner can be configured to work with other programs, but one has to spend some time digging to figure this out. I have spent an entire day on this -- trying the updated drivers, etc., etc. Why Epson passes off the Smart Panel support to the 3rd party Newsoft is beyond me. They should eliminate the ""Smart Panel"" entirely. The documentation also stinks. I haven't had enough time to fully rate the scans themselves, but so far they seem good. I'm just soooo disappointed with the lack of ease of use."
1,Big Mistake,"From the first, the sound quality on this phone was poor, and we had some trouble hearing people, even on the highest volume setting. Sound quality on the digital message recorder was also wobbly. Now the head phone jack is loose, and it's causing us to be unable to use the handset -- sound cuts in and out during phone conversations. In short, it's junk. I've heard that Uniden is one of the better brands, but not with this model!"
2,"Great, but breaks every 8 months.","I've had these glasses for 1.5 years.Pros:* look great on small faces (like mine)* cover your vision completely (it's basically impossible to look over the top of the glasses when you're biking)* super light-weight (combined with the vision coverage mentioned above), you will not know you're wearing them* hold to the face pretty well, nose bridge is adjustable for a better fitCons:* they have a tendency to fog up if you stop moving after a hard workout* THEY BREAK DOWN THE MIDDLE EVERY 8 MONTHS OR SO... the design is flawed, the screws in the center weaken the structure of the lens, causing it to eventually crack down the middle and split in two. I've had two pairs do this. Rudy Project has been good about replacing the broken glasses under warranty, but it's a pain to have to deal with the issue, and it shouldn't happen.Ultimately, I'd say skip this design until Rudy Project fixes the problem."
4,A truely origonal story.,"Skybreaker is probably the most original book I have ever read. From it's flying jelly-fish squids to it's flying spiders. Along with supernatural creatures the book also has some remarkable realism, for example, when the story leads to being 20,000 feet in the air.... the book describes how the air was much thinner then it was at ground level. Matt Cruse, the main character, is around 16 years old and he really enjoys being in the sky on an airship (he was actually born on one). The story is basically about Matt's journey to find another airship, the Hyperion, that mysteriously went missing about 40 years ago. It was said that the Hyperion had treasure on it, but no one new for sure. The author creates very mysterious situations in which I found my self not able to read fast enough to see what would happen next. Overall , if you're looking for a book that will not let you take your eyes away from the page then Skybreaker would be my recommendation to you!"
4,Awesome Book,"This is a really great book for young and old people alike. It's recommended that you read the first book, Airborn, first. Otherwise, you probably wouldn't get many of the different parts. Skybreaker is very well-written, complete with plot twists, cliffhangers, and a very interesting storyline/plot. There's some excellent character plot development, and you actually feel as though you are personally aquainted with Matt Cruse, the main character. This action-packed novel keeps you guessing and wanting to know what's going to happen next: it's nigh impossible to put it down. Supurb for people who like fantasy/action-adventure type books. 4 Stars."
1,Refurbished - Never Again,"I ordered this unit refurbished in Feb. 2004. Main reason I bought it was for the CD player for my work desk. Within 3 months and very, very little play time the CD unit crapped out. I don't get radio reception so the unit is worthless to me - in more ways than one. I'll never, ever buy refurbished ANYTHING again. Just throwing money out the window."
4,Slaver's Challenge,"Comfortable! No offense intended. This book was a great read.The author has the ability to put the reader in the midst of the plot. I could almost see, hear , and smell what was going on. There were many twists and turns that kept me on my toes. The author even caught me leaning the wrong way a couple of times. There is a little bit of everything in this book. From spaceships and lasers to horses and swords, it's all here.I like to read while travelling, and this book would be great for that! It will leave you longing for extended flights, but not delays (nothing can make you wish for that). The book felt like an old friend, comfortable. I'm ready for the sequel!So why 4 stars and not 5? I guess that I turned into my old chemistry professor. Nobody gets a 100!"
3,Missing a vital part,"The majority of the book consists of an alphabetical guide to CSS properties. If you need to look up what a particular property does this would be quite useful. However, if you are trying to find a property to use and you do not know the name, this does not help. The book is entirely lacking any catagorical index to the CSS properties. Had CSS Pocket Reference 2nd Edition contained a two to four page index of the properties grouped by catagories such as text, layout, borders and so forth, I would have rated it better, but alas, it does not."
5,Fits in your pocket - 2nd Edition,"This small, handy book is packed with CSS references perfect for grabbing and flipping through when looking for that one piece of code to add to your site. It is not a book about learning CSS. This reference book is a alphabetical listing of CSS selectors and properties. As I was learning CSS I found this book very helpful in locating quickly the code I was looking for."
4,"Review of ""CSS Pocket Reference"" (2nd Edition)","This is a well laid-out, concise reference for CSS. I use it a lot to quickly look up things I don't recall. If you are using CSS successfully and would like a quick reference to properties and such, this small book should fit the bill.This book is not a tutorial and it's not a good choice for learning the basics of CSS.Ideally you should have a more complete guide available for when you want more detail.Want more? See my somewhat longer review on Oakland Perl Mongers.George Woolley of Oakland.pm and Camelot.pm"
5,Indispensable reference,"I am a big fan of O'Reilly's ""Pocket Reference"" books and this one was no disappointment. In fact, this guide by Eric Meyer is exceptionally well written with clear explanations of CSS terminology. The first few sections on rules, precedence, positioning, layouts, etc. helped me - fairly new to CSS - grasp the gist of CSS better than more extensive tutorials because of Meyer's concise explanations and well-conceived illustrations. Of course, the long-term value of these reference books is the alphabetical list of terms with definitions, applications, syntax and examples.As with the other Pocket Reference books, a beginner should not come to this book for an introduction to CSS. There are many great books (some by Meyer) and web sites that get you up and running quickly. But even the beginner will find this invaluable as a quick reference book throughout the learning process. I keep it right next to my screen when doing any web work. Highly recommended."
4,a great CSS1 reference,"this is a great book if you are looking for a CSS1 reference. as other reviewers have mentioned here, this predates the CSS2 specification and will not be as helpful for more advanced web designers/coders. however most modern browsers now have a near-complete implementation of CSS1, so if you are just learning CSS or want your websites to have older browser compatibility, this will be very handy."
3,Obsolete before it hit the shelves,"This book does not cover CSS2 nor any of the new versions of the most popular browsers: IE 6, Opera 6, and Netscape 7. Because of these omissions, a significant amount of CSS functionality that is available on most users' browsers is not even mentioned. My advice: find a book that is more up-to-date and buy it instead of this one."
5,Indispensable Reference,"Large books, by their very nature, can have good points and bad points. After all, if you have a couple or several hundred pages worth of material, you are bound to get some things right and some things wrong.But these pocket reference books from O'Reilly are great. They aren't for learning, rather they are what they say they are: a pocket reference. (Nice to see some truth in advertising for a change.)If you buy this book you will use it. A lot. Period."
2,Lacking coverage of newer CSS properties,"This book is good for the basics but it does not cover CSS2 so If your looking for an advanced css reference, this isnt it. It really needs to be updated with a new edition since this one is from 2001."
3,Dense Political History of Indonesia,"This book is a good book if you are interested in the political development of the Indonesian government in the twentieth century. Starting with the Dutch rule through the Japanese occupation to Independance. Dahm makes it clear that the feeling of nationalism has always been present since the end of the 19th century and does that convincingly.The book however is not an easy read. It is dense and full with names and not always easy to keep track of. It is definitely not a book to give to someone on a birthday. It is however perfect when someone is interested in the development of government in Indonesia with names like Hatta, Suharto and Sukarno.Extensive endnotes"
4,alright!!,"I bought a CD called ""FoxKids - Hits 1"" some 5 years ago, and I got this song called ""Not Too Young, Not Too Old"". I thought it was awesome! But, I've listened to it many, many times now, and it's becoming a little ""old"" (of course!!) I collect AC-songs, and this ""Everybody Stand Up""-song is one of 3 songs that I don't have. So, I'm actually planning to spend about 20 dollars for this song. You see, when you've got about everything - you don't stop before you HAVE everything.. But then I read one of the comments down here saying the track is missing from the single..? Is this true?"
1,jipped,"The cd says that it is supposed to have a song on the cd called ""Everybody Stand Up"" and I ordered it for my cousin and the song wasn't there Not to young not to old is a great song but i basically paid over 20 dollars for a one song cd of a song she already had and I was not very happy about it."
2,Not what I expected,This author needs to hire a new proof reader.There are so many typos in this book that Idon't know if I will dare try making any ofthe recipes.
5,The first Christmas gift of the year!,"My family and I have already enjoyed a couple of other books by Mike Reiss, and this one shares his lively wit and terrific way with language. The illustrations are gorgeous, and almost as funny as the text. If you read to your kids, and you've got ""Santa Claustrophobia"" on hand, you'll look forward to the story hour as much as they do."
5,Perfect!,"This is the Perfect kit for the serious DIYer. The balance of every tool is great. The trigger on both drivers allows for very slow speed, when necessary, or all out grunt. Beats the heck out of my 9.9v and 14.4v stuff, that has been given to a neighbor because the batteries were not holding a charge any more.The circular saw is incredibly handy. I have not used it a ton yet, except on a small deck project where I was cutting Trex. No problems at all, even with the stock blade.Everything is lightweight and the Lithium technology is superb.Highly recommended!"
3,"Fun, but not a good simulation","I've enjoyed the game, but its outcomes don't seem realistic. For example, I've just reenacted the 1908 season, and Harry Lumley of Brooklyn hit 132 home runs. In real life, he hit 4. Mike Donlin was the batting leader with a .514 batting average. Perhaps I'm doing something wrong, but I suspect that it would be important to think of this as a game and not as a simulation."
2,Fun for a while..,"This is a fun little game. It does not compare to the other text based games (like out of the park 5), but it does not try to. If you like your game lite w/ out the bother of hiring coaches, scouts etc. and you like it to be easy, this is your game! Try it out, you may fall in love. I recommend this game to any new text based baseball game, then when you are ready to move up go try something else. Great starting point for players!"
2,2k4 or 2k3?,"2k4 is not much of an upgrade from 2k3 (or 2k2 for that matter). You have full screen now and can upload any season (things you could already do with many other text based sims). I'm not sure the game offers much from 2k3. I would recommend picking up an old copy of Baseball Mogul 2K if you really wanting to play this game. Or go try OOTP 5 (at www.....com) if you want something more advanced. But if you are looking for something a little simple, then pick this game up! It is very good for what it is. Just expect a lite game is all!"
2,Looks great - poor quality,"This faucet looks very slick, was easy to install, and works well, but after using it for about 9 months metal starts to peel off from the handles.Warranty is supposed to cover replacement parts, but I have notbeen able to reach the warranty department yet and I do not look forward to spending Saturday afternoon replacing the handles.For the price of this faucet I would expect a product of better quality.I will definitely not buy another product from Danze."
3,They work,"I had an old booster cable that had rusted contacts so I replaced them with these. The only complaint I have is the clamp that should be designed to hold the cable by its jacket looks like it is designed to grab the copper itself. After a number of uses the copper breaks or frays and you have to open the clamp to get more copper in there to secure it. If you pull on the booster cable clamps you are pullling on bare copper.Other than that, the unique design of the contacts makes it useful for batteries in any configuration. The contact tip is also not as secure as I would like but it works."
3,"Decent, but not great.","I have been a Labyrinth fan since No Limits. This album is good but is way to far from other releases like Return to Heaven Denied and Sons of Thunder. It sound similar to Freeman but here the music sounds weak ,almost timid. Roberto Tiranti's vocals are always good but they are the only trully good part of the recording.I honestly hope Labyrinth's next release will be better."
1,Worse headphones you can buy,"I bought the Philips/Nike armband radio about a year ago. I've been using it sparsely, and only during running. First set of headphones stopped working after about 20 hours of playing. I thought ""oh well, these things happen"" and bought another one. I was extremely gentle with it, I was making sure that I wouldn't pull the cord in any way. Still, second set of headphones stopped working exactly like the first one: Apparently the cord was cut again, somewhere in the jack. At that time I was really pissed off, but unfortunately next time I went for a run the only shop around was a Nike, so I ended up with a 3rd set of headphones. Believe it or not, that set broke too, BEFORE the first battery was exhausted. At that time I decided to write this review and make it clear that I'll never buy anything else from Philips (who's responsible for this terrible manufacturing quality)"
4,"Great sound, good fit","I bought these to run on a treadmill with, and for that they work great. I personally didn't have any of the fit issues others complained about. For ""ear bud"" style head phones, I like the design, the pressure the headbad gives definately helped them stay in place. The cord is on the short side, so it is better suited to some sort of arm band device where you can route the cord behind your back. The nice thing with that is the cord isn't flopping around in front of you when you run.The only problem I have with them is someone stole them when I was at the gym. My own fault I suppose for letting them out of my sight. I'm looking to definately replace them with the same model."
3,"Decent headphones, but not sweatproof","After reading the reviews posted here on Amazon, I bought a pair of these phones for runs and other workouts.After figuring out that these phones are designed to go OVER your ears, I found I really liked the fit. They don't come out, even if you run into things. And it's HILARIOUS to see all the tech-challenged people at the gym wearing them UPSIDE DOWN. I showed one guy how to wear them correctly, and he was so embarassed, he left early.But here's my problem with these headphones. I sweat a lot, and, after a dozen runs or so, they quit working. So I bought a pair of Sony MDR-A35G S2 Sports Headphones. I'm still sweat testing them, but so far they seem to be impervious and also have better dynamic range than the Nikes.I do like the design of the Nikes beter, however.If you don't sweat buckets and run a lot, these phones are a decent choice."
2,"Buy cheap, buy twice...","These headphones were great for the first 5 weeks -- lightweight, unobtrusive, and decent sound. Then the left sound cut out. Snip. In the middle of a tedious 10miler on the treadmill. That particular workout turned hellishly boring real quick!I dunno if the sweat from running did 'em in, but considering that the product bills itself as a ""Sport"" headphone, pretty disappointed at the durability.Going with the Sennheiser PMX70 instead..hope these new ones last."
1,Total rubbish!,"I bought these at an Apple store in NYC and I thought they'd be great for jogging and listening to my iPod. The only good thing is the sound: it has a deep bass and overall great sound quality. The bad thing: they can't stay on my ears! As you jog, the earphones slip away. Hell, even if you just walk they slip away. They are NOT a perfect fit (my head is from this earth so they should work on me!). What a waste of money! I had to go back to my regular iPod earphones. Maybe if you sit and relax and listen to your music without moving they'll be good on you. Otherwise, steer clear from this faulty product!"
2,horrific design,"Well i see this product has already gotten it's share of bad reviews but i still wanted to take a shot.The first thing that is wrong with these is the actual earpeices. They're not very comfortable and like everyone else says they just won't stay in your ears. The second thing i don't like is that the chord is in the back. It's the most ridiculous thing i've ever seen. I mean the chord is already too short, but now if you're plugging them into anything in front of you it has to wrap around your neck which takes away several inches of chord length. It's also uncomfortable and it makes the earphones fall off if you turn your head even slightly.The only reason i'm giving it two stars instead of one (or none at all) is because the sound is pretty good (although you can get just as good with a better designed head set) and i like how flexible the thing that wraps around your head is."
1,Reviews would have stopped me,"I will have to remember never to buy anything ever again without first consulting the reviews on here. If I would have waited, went home and checked Amazon out- I would have saved myself $12 and never purchased these piece of crap headphones!! I like how everyone says they sound good if you can get them to stay in your ears! What I would like to know is, how do you get them to stay in your ears?? I can't believe Nike would put their name on something like this- I guess I'll never be buying Nike- again!"
1,"Uncomfortable, don't fit","I bought these headphones when i needed headphones for running, but these are almost completely unusable, especially after you sweat. As you move, it move around so the sound you get is not stable. Works better upside down, but very uncomfortable and easy to come off."
1,Horribly uncomfortable earbuds or misshapen head?,"Hands down, the most uncomfortable earbuds I've ever worn, even worse than stock iPod earbuds (either that or I have a misshapen head, which I can't rule out). Sound qualilty is quite good and the behind the neck design is great for running or other upright activities but these qualities mean nothing if you can't stand to have the earbuds in your ears for more than 20 minutes. I've tested several sets of ""sport"" headphones/earbuds and these are, by far, the worst. To top it off, the buds pop out if you're doing any exercises on your back (bench presses, etc)."
1,Don't bother,These things stink. I never really had an issue with earphone irritation till I purchased these. They are not quite in or out of the ear. Do not be fooled by the sleek look. I would rather wear my no-name earphones than this piece.
3,"Great fit for runny, but very unreliable","My first pair came with a Nike/Phillips mp3 player. They fit very well for running, and I haven't found a pair yet, that fits as well. I had problems with loosing the rubber ear-bud covers and problems with the headphones breaking."
4,Great for running,"I'm one of those people who has never liked earbud headphones for running because they never fit securely enough in my ears, and irritatingly fall out. These headphones overcome this problem perfectly with an innovative behind the neck design. The headband has just enough natural flex to keep the earpieces in your ears even if you twist your head a lot, such as you need to when crossing the street while running They are VERY lightweight. As mentioned elsewhere, the cord is not long.. not really long enough to reach into a pants pocket, but perfect length for arm or waistband.If you need lightweight inexpensive headphones for running - these are great.Only real drawback is the audio quality at the bass end of the spectrum - quite lacking, but then thats a consequence of the loose-fitting design and the size."
3,It's just okay,"At first when I got the headphones, they looked really cool. I tryed them on, and they were okay but whenever I moved my head, one of the earphones kept on falling out. Then when I put them in my backpack, the blue piece of rubber kept on falling off and I almost lost it. However, to stop them from coming off your head I found if you wore them upside down with the left side in the right ear, they stayed on perfectly. Besides the problems they deliever great sound"
1,not for athletics,"These are advertised as sport headphones, but are a horrible design if you plan to use them for anything athletic (and they're pretty bad even if you don't).The earbuds seem to be of high quality. The problem is that the loop of plastic that connects the two earbuds is way to long for the average user (and I'm a 200 pound guy). Instead of going around the back of the head, the loop hangs halfway down the neck, which means any neck movement you make will cause the ear buds to move inside of your ear canal. First, this makes an annoying, loud, rustling sound with every step you jog. Second, this is going to start iritating your skin at some point. I only got halfway down the block before I gave up and turned around.For those of you already stuck with these pieces of garbage, you might try wearing them upside down (so that they loop over your ears). The ear bud angle isn't quite right, but it sort of works...."
1,Terrible design,"I didn't get a chance to try these out before purchasing - this is a terrible design. Used ""as directed"", any head motion shifts the entire device, resulting in noise and loss of connection to the ear. Since these are supposed to be for active use, this is going to be a normal condition. Things are improved if you use them upside down. Instead I would get something with the earphones not connected in a single piece to avoid this problem."
1,won't stay put,"I may just be made wrong...but these headphones don't stay put when I'm running. I have to wear them upside down, which is majorly uncomfortable, just to get them to stay in my ears.Alas..."
1,shelf stereo,"It is hard to find a shelf stereo with a 5 disc changer, and for such a low price. I love the look and features of this stereo, but I have had nothing but bad luck with the operation. I had ongoing trouble where the cd's randomly stopped playing, as if they were not being read. (I had no problem with the same cd's playing on another stereo.) I exchanged the stereo, thinking it was a defect but the second one did the very same thing, The last straw was when the cd drawer went bad and would not release the cd's. I am returning this for a refund."
1,RS2664,"FM Tuner did not work well. It would tune a station, then fade to fuzz after about 20 seconds. We kept it because the unit sounded great with the CD player. Then, after a couple months the CD sound started to hiss. It seems one of the speakers went out. It is now out of store warrenty so I can't return it, so I shipped it back to RCA and am waiting for a replacement unit."
2,Drawer stuck open after 1.5 years,"The sound is pretty good, but my drawer became stuck in the open position after a year and a half."
2,Bookshelf System,"Not a very good product. Sounds OK but even new CDs skip. Controls are minimal, confusing, and workmanship/materials low grade. Pass on this one."
1,RCA should be ashamed to offer such a shabby product.,Bought this for my house in Cabo San Lucas. I've had the same problems that everyone else has had. CD changer won't play CDs or even let me pull the CDs out - plus now it gets stuck in an endless attempt to change and access the CDs but won't play any - I have to unplug and start it up again carefully selecting only the FM or AUX so it won't start up again. Luckily it has the auxiliary inputs (usb and rca) to I can plug my video player or computer into it and play CDs that way. The sound is great. Also the radio stations fade off the mark and I have to retune. I'm going to try to find someone to fix it down here (they're much better in Mexico at keeping things running than up in the states). Won't be buying another RCA product again soon. RCA should be ashamed to offer such an unreliable product!
4,"Great product, no complaints","Product showed up in a timely manner in perfect condition. Easy to set up, great sound quality for the price."
2,Broken,"This is a great idea but due to poor quality, I have a very sad child. The IR simply doesn't work. It emits a strong signal but the robot does not respond. Having to remove the battery pack to reboot this thing (often) or preserve the battery is also a pain - this will result in worn wires and connectors over time. You should be able to simply plug in the charger. Definite design flaw. The Chinglish manual is also an indicator of sub standard manufacturing. Save your money."
3,Buy an Aibo instead!,"I bought a older version by Tiger about a year ago off [...]. All I can say is that my I Cybie has been gathering dust in the corner after a week of buying it. I bet if you buy extras like the WUC (walk up charger) and a programmed Z2 cartridge it would be better but I just started saving up for an aibo. I'm not trying to bring I Cybie down - you get a great deal for the price your paying. Used older 210 Aibo's cost about $300 to $500 and this new I Cybie costs $200. Save a little more money and buy an aibo instead, I guarantee you will be happier with it. Aibo also has a big community. They have meetings or ""shindigs"" where they make all the aibos dance together and loads of other stuff like someone even made a Aibo Motorcycle which the aibo rides by itself.[...]Hope this helps you out with your decision, ATTE / cybielover"
2,Description lies the doggy can not recharge it self,in order the batery to be charged it must be unpluged...which mean u must desemble the doggys belly and take the battery out...he is clever thing probably since mine arrived broken but i expected more like an aibo and he is simple as it comes and wrong description....
1,save your money,this game sucks. it would be much better if you could pick yourrifle instead of getting whatever the game gives you. and your spotter is stupid so he dies al the time . i wish i hadn't bought it
1,Low Budget,"This ia a low budget first person shooter. The game forces you to travel in one direction and if you try and explore outside the mission area the game kills you. You have a spotter who travels with you and if your spotter dies, you die. The game is pretty simple and ends quite suddenly and has very little replay value. I guess this game is ok if you're looking for a cheap time killer, but it ain't good for much else."
2,You get what you pay for,"Like the other review states it's a BUDGET title. For the price it's not bad, just don't expect it to be on the level with a title like Medal of Honor. The graphics are so so, but the controls are one of the best features of the game. The story line could have been stronger. But if you like playing as a sniper this game lets you do just that."
2,Not much info,There is not much info here. I should not have bought it. What can one expect from something that was only $3.95?
5,Great information,"This book is clear, and concise yet packed with important information. It's hard to find information specifically about this condition, and rather than scour the internet for questionable information, get this book. It's a quick read and worth every penny."
3,Tolerable reading about intolerable events.,"The author writes, with a typical southern style, about life in a small southern town. The author illustrates a life in the ""new south"" that seems more akin to the ""old south"".Is the author another Faulkner...not yet. The author does exhibit a knack for characterizations."
2,not compatible with windows xp,"I just purchased a Dell 4550 with all the bells and whistles. Needed a Photo Scanner, best logical choice, the Epson 1660 photo scanner. Installation a breeze until I added the Adobe Photo Elements v2.0. Then the problems began. Error messages kept appearing. Adobe photo elements has XP approval but the Epson 1660 photo scanner is not approved by Microsoft XP OS System. Buyer beware! Epson software will not coexist in same XP system with Adobe Photo elements. Issues with Epson need to be addressed with their software."
5,Really fast...,"In the past I had always purchased HP scanners which are pretty good, but when compared to the Epson - the speed of the HP's fell way short.I really like the integration with other software (like Adobe Photo Shop) and also its own ""Epson Smart Panel"" which is so easy anyone can use it.Also, when scanning 35mm photos (I still have some of those!) the resolution is fantastic, I can fix minutes details in the photos and I end up with a better product than the original.Two thumbs up!!"
2,Unsatisfactory XP installation,"I was not able to install this properly on my Windows XP PCafter many hours trying. The installation CD supplied by Epson generated numerous errors, so I went to the Epson support website. The site directed me to a third party website. I followed the instructions there (uninstall XP patch, install software, install another XP patch), but the 'Smart Panel' software still would not run. I finally got it to work by runnning it under Windows 98 compatibility mode. Some XP users have gotten it installed easily, but in my case it was a big hassle! Too bad, since the scanning quality is good."
2,Don't use this for scanning diapositives!,"A few months ago I finally made the decision to digitalise alle the travel pictures I'd ever made (mostly on diapostive film) and bought this Epson Perfection 1660 Photo with diapostiive layer (6 at a time), which looked very good and had a good reputation. But the Twain software doesn't do its job properly on scanning diapositives. It cuts borders, decides on its own where to cut a darker zone in a picture (shadows, contrasting colors) with the result that it sometimes splits pictures in half, or cuts away a part of it. Especially pictures taken in the evening or at night are a nightmare to scan.And then, after I reinstalled the software for a third time, it suddenly cancelled the install procedure, and now for some reason it's impossible to install the Twain software again. The helpdesk hasn't been very helpfull (motto: help yourself), so after three months' use, I find myself with an unusable scanner. Thank you, Epson!"
1,I will never ever buy EPSON again,"First, I'm computer professional and I've been doing this stuff for years and years. The Epson software for this scanner is flaky. I've used it under Windows 2000 and Windows XP and it is not reliable. Sure, when it works it's ok. But, quite often it pops up modal or non-modal but very non-standard Windows windows that you can't get to with Alt-TAB and they are not in the Task Manager. Basically, you're hosed and you need to reboot. If you've scanned a bunch of images in and they have not yet been saved to file, they are gone. You've just wasted a little bit of your life. And installing the drivers is another time that Epson gets to steal from your life.Epson used to make the ONLY printer in the old days, but I don't know what they are doing now. But I do know that I will never buy an Epson product for the rest of my life."
1,Flawed Driver Dooms Scanner for XP,"Pity... Latest driver from Epson (5.71) is dated at Dec 02, and it's obvious they have moved on to other tasks. Aside from annoying but surmountable installation problems, the Twain driver would hit the hard drive needlessly every second after invocation in XP, whether or not any Twain-aware application program was subsequently running. And it would freeze near the end of 1600 dpi 35mm slide scans. With no new driver in sight, had to return the scanner. You'd think they would support the product enough to have it work as advertised. Still looking for a decent 35mm slide scanner..."
3,Frustrating,The scanner itself is pretty good. It provides crisp scans with pretty good color rendition. But couldn't they have spent a couple of dollars and included a manual. Going back and forth between the sreens is just not worth the trouble. If it wasn't a gift I would return it.
3,OK Scanner for most work...,"This scanner produces fair results for most work. There is a major flaw in the design that prospective buyers should know. The assumption is that when scanning negatives, there will be a difference in density between the edge of the frame and the inter-frame space. This is usually, but not always the case. I have a large project involving photographing small items against a black background. I carefully exposed so that the black background produces no density on the negative. This allows the maximum dynamic range for the object I'm photographing. This scanner refuses to scan the entire strip. I get nothing. If you need a scanner for negatives, this is probably not the one to get."
1,UNFULFILLMENT,"LA COMPRA DE REALIZAR escáner que mal resultado , TI no está funcionando y no desde el principio se rompió , POR LO TANTO NO PUEDO HABLAR DE SU OPERACIÓN"
2,dark and dingy,"I bought this to reproduce my illustrations and am rather disappointed. No matter how I tweak exposure and colors, my white grounds read as grey, which makes the rest of my colors look like old socks. Worse yet, since my paper is larger than the bed, I get a darker border up the edges of the image where it doesn't lie flush to the glass. Maybe I'm missing something, but I've had much better luck with hp's. True this was a breeze to set up, but it's not delivering the quality I had hoped for."
1,THIS SCANNER IS NOW WORTHLESS,"Worked fine when first installed. Lost hard drive and now ubable to re-install. Have done extensive and very time consuming research on the problem to no avail. Have un-installed and re-installed several times, following the instructions carefully.Keep getting the same error message when trying to open the so called ""Smart Panel"". ......""APPLICATION FAILED TO INSTALL BECAUSE: ISM.DLL WAS NOT FOUND. REINSTALLING ALLPICATION MAY FIX THIS PROBLEM""Well this did not fix the problem and I now have an expensive EPSON PERFECTION 1160 PHOTO scanner whih is useless. No help from online support."
1,Don't use this S***,I used this product and it didn't affect on my hairs i thought it'll make my hair looks good but after some days my hair felling down and so much dry
4,My Radio Review,This radio is great! The remote control comes in very handy.I have two complaints about this radio:#1: the alarms may not be loud enough for a heavy sleeper.#2: it is not possible to turn the volume using the remote.The music comes through loud and clear.I would recommend this radio to anyone.
5,Mexikayotl2012,This is a great book for those in the beginning stages of learning Nahua History. Or Aztec/Indigenous History.Kurly Tlapoyawa's work on this book was eloquently structured for easy reading with vast information.A must read.
5,It opened my eyes,"The book is great - informative and intriguing.This book really opened my eyes and it indeed changed what i do with my free time. In short, i have been awaken and now i seek more knowledge."
5,Doesn't work on Vista,"I will not bother to tell you how much fun this game is; there are plenty of other reviews that wax rhapsodic about it and they are absolutely right.Here's the problem: it doesn't work on Vista. If you have a newer computer, therefore, I urge you to skip this particular purchase."
3,not very challenging,"I've played Caesar, pharaoh, cleopatra, zeus & poseidon. I expected more. I played Caesar & pharaoh for months at a time. Poseidon is just not as challenging as the former games. I do like the ""episode"" concept better than having to complete an entire level (like caesar or pharaoh), but the episodes are too easy. The cartooney look and feel is also somewhat patronizing."
3,its alright,"this game is too much like pharaoh buts its just not as good. Pharaoh had me playing for hours, building cities over and over again making them better and cooler each time, this game tries to deliver that, but doesn't quite reach the mark."
5,wow,IF ZEUS WAS GOOD THIS HAS TO BE GREAT FROM WHAT IVE READ THERE ARE ALOT OF CHEATS AND MORE GODS MORE HEROES MORE MONSTERS AND THAT EQUALS MORE FUN. YOU WILL BE HOOKED ON THIS GAME FOR HOUR!
2,"For Tropheus very overrated, but still godd","If you research the web, you will quickly find this book is recommended as the 'bible' for Tropheus enthusiasts. I found there to be about 10 pages of Trpopheus content. Good stuff, but thats it. Nice pictures and interesting background on the lake itself. Good book - but not if you are interested specifically in Tropheus."
4,Great light but smaller than I expected,"This seems to be a great product but it is not the large ball I though I was buying. It would be good if the diameter was prominently advertised, not just the number of lights. You ever try to count the number of lights on one of these? It could drive you nuts. Anyhow, it's only about 6"" in diameter."
4,Lovely Pink,"This small ball of pretty lights works and looks wonderful, but it's not quite as purple as this photo shows. It's more magenta. Still pretty, though!"
4,Purple Sphere,A good product and cant wait to use it in my next lighting project. It was a pity I had to find a way to buy it as Im from Au. Will buy more later on.
1,wrong color purple..,the picture it shows is a true purple.. the sphere I got was a red purple.. not the right color.. very disappointed that the color shown was not the color sent.. :)
5,Mystic light,"I just love this multi Christmas sphere light, it has a beautiful glow which lights the whole room. I wish I would have gotten more than one for Christmas but I surely will next year. I'm very pleased with my purchase and urge anyone who likes Christmas to add them to their decor."
4,Beautiful lights,"Well packaged, warm white color looks great. Wire length is long so installation is easy. Would like to see a white wire option."
5,Beautiful!,These beautiful light spheres arrived as advertised and in great condition. (I bought two to hang on either side of my enclosed porch.) They are a wonderful addition to my holiday decor. I absolutely love them and may purchase them in other colors for other holidays. Buy it!
2,good product too small for super coupe,these injectors will not work on the t-bird super coupe. you need 46# INJECTOR.. do not purchase for you t-bird sc
1,Doesn't ISA Employ an Error and Fact Checker?,"This book is full of confusing references, poor explanations and in some cases is just plain wrong. There is no doubt the author has worked in the industry, but has clearly focused on AC and DC Drives. Many of his explanations of mechanical concepts are confusing. His explanations of Stepper Motors, Servo Motors, and Linear Motors are confusing and often misleading. There are also numerous typos.I have worked with motors and drives for 16 years and was very disappointed in the quality of this book. I expected more from the ISA Press (publisher)."
2,timeless,"To spend much time to review this book will give it more credit than it deserves....No, I am not a UN employee or a UN lover....Just an average American who feels life is more important thanwasting it on a book by some United Nations cry babies."
2,why bother?,a bunch of complete non-sense that nobody outside the UN could care less about....about as ireelevant and trashy as a B-GradeMiramax movie....makes Kill Bill 2 look like Gone With The Wind!!!! Miramax is doing nothing nore than picking one's pocket with this book....should be sold in a brown paper bag...also if Miramax was really concerned about its readers....they would include a barf bag when you purchase the book...and pictures yet? adds nothing to the book.....my guess is that the book was inspired by the UN's staff union who will use salesas a fund raiser....at the UN money talks...even counterfeit currency
2,G A R B A G E,I cannot figure out why this trash was written....I see no redeeming social value other than to make a quick buck....i do not need to spend (...)and read 300 pages to see that theUN is run like a fraternity house....perhaps the authors should re-name their book Monty Python's Flying Circus on the East RiverIt reminds me of the fairy tales I see James Bone writing about in the London Times
1,yuk,"this is no more than three self indulgant UN bureucrats asking usto care about their meaningless ""exploits"" around the world....everyone knows the UN is loaded with dead weight starting withthe biggest freeloader this side of the Mississippi.....his excellencyKofi Annan...do any of us really care about these bank robbers on the East River?this book is yet another attempt by UN'rs to rob the pocketsof the US tax payers...do yourself a favor....do not buy this book...give the money to a homeless person instead"
5,Stunning.,"I read this book while backpacking. I was at a hostel and devoured it within three days.As a former die-hard activist and foreign aide advocate, with plans on joining either Peace Corps or UN, this anecdote was an eye-opener and a great counterpoint to many of the perspectives I had yet encountered.It is well-written and well-structured, and I believe anyone who is ignorant of UN/peacekeeping experiences, wants to know a little bit more about an area they are interested in, or who simply wants a gripping three-perspective narrative, should definitely read this book."
4,Foreign policy failures,"Emergency Sex is an excellent book detailing the failure of the United nations and the United States preventing horrific crimes around the world. All the characters in the book are flawed i.e. they asre human, and deal with the situations they are exposed to differently, but the book should not be judged on the basis of the authors having an idealistic view of the world. The book's strengths lie in the complete failures of the United Nations to do anything correctly, and when the so completely fail to take any responsibility for the lack of action. It also points out the complete lack of a foreign policy by the Clinton administration. This is an excellent book"
3,good purchase,Interesting account of what it takes mentally to do humanitarian work. Slow at first but a good read.
5,Riveting storytelling in unique voices,"This book was recommended to me through a friend's book club, and I don't do book clubs. But this one is making the rounds and is one of the few books I buy for people, and I'm consistently loaning my copy out.The structure of the entire book and the chapter-by-chapter flow is unique and blends together fluidly. Such an easy read. A little slow at the start, but then I couldn't put it down. The opportunity to peek into that world is eye-opening for even the seasoned traveler. A must-read for anyone interested in things global/international or just humanity."
3,hmmmm,The book is interesting if you have a passion to relive the sordid lives of three UN peacekeeping personnel.....it is mildly interesting...but a Bill Clinton book it is not......not a must read
2,stinker,"This is a book about three incredibly self-centered UN ""troopers""who feel the world will pluck down $25 to hear their ""yarns"" about their years in UN field operations.... Really? who cares?Everyone knows the UN has been ripping off the public for years...this is news?Who cares if UN officials pass their time away in Cambodiadrinking ""space shuttles"" (a drink of coke, marijuana and cognac)... Boutros Boutros-Ghali use to spend his time at the UNdrinking Scotch and Valium!.he used to call it a ""Mike McCann""..now there's a drink!The UN is a big waste of time and money and this book proves it...the only thing worse than the UN ripping off the publicis Miramax trying to make a buck off it.....Mickey Mouse (Disney is the parent of Miramax Books) hang your head in shame!"
2,typically american...,"this reads like the diary of 2 bored teenagers who come to realize how boring their lives are and decide that a little peacekeeping could provide for a fun change....Both Ken and Heidi exhibit typical american arrogance and ignorance of what the world is really like out there (and before anyone says I don't know anything about this, well i do); several remarks made by the two furthermore reinforces the stereotypes of americans out to ""export democracy"" to the world as Ken says...what democracy I ask?"
2,good for wrapping fishes,I have read this book and cannot understand the purpose behind it. It reads like a bad Harelquin romance novel...if it wasn't so outrageous it would be sad....I just don't see the reason for this book to have been written....I should have realized this and could have sent my money to UNICEF where it would have done some good.....
2,what me worry?,"This book and I use the term loosely, is not much more than three low level menial UN employees trying to bamboozle readersinto thinking that they are important...which they are not....the book is boring as well as the sex and booze parties they describe...the pictures were not needed...once you see themyou can understand why this ""three-some"" needed ""emergency sex""it was the only kind they could get!!!to spend good money on a bad book is a crime...the UN's staff union cannot even give the book away as a party favor!!It reminds me of a book written by an old UN'r Chief Michael McCann....I believe the title was ""The UN...Has it's time come and Gone?"" Who cares about history written by GadFlies!And that's what these authors really are...Gad FLIES!"
2,take the money and run,"Why was this book written? I read it twice and still cannot answer the question....Do these three authors think much of the world will spend good money to hear unsubstantiated ""gossip"" as these three UN bureaucrats run around the world? If I want that,I would buy Bill Clinton's book...Emergency Sex...that shuuld have been Bill'sbook's title...this book should bave been called ""Tales From The Crypt"" because it should have been buried....which is what I will do with my copy right now....I feel the authors and Miramax have picked my pocket"
1,"Mon dieu, this is bad!","As others have noted. This is a whiny tell-all by spoilt white kids about travels paid for by the UN and other hapless organizations. The Aussie guy actually seems okay, but the other two are hopeless. They have somehow convinced themselves they ""changing the world!""Do something more constructive with your money and give it to a homeless person. This is awful. It gets a one star because the spelling is acceptable."
5,Excellent read! A must!,A must read for those with a politically active lifestyle or those that like to stay abreast of happenings around the globe.
4,dont be fooled by title,"As i read the book on a plane , i got a few strange looks due to the title i suspect . But dont be fooled , this is a book which made me feel compassion , joy and sorrow . You will feel anger at the politics of the UN but the book does show that we can all make a difference just by doing something about the world we live in .Read it and then try and do something not matter how ""small"" it may seem . Yes I know this review may be seen as fluff but there are plenty of others who can discuss the politics . Focus on the humanity and what you can do ."
1,The UN deserves better,"How is it be possible to come across so selfishly while proclaiming to be dedicating one's life to the greater good? Well, two of the authors manage to do it. Did they decide to work on some of the UN's most dangerous missions to help the locals survive or to flee thier own inadequacies and trumped up versions of their worth? I am afraid the latter is the case. This book is a monument to youthful recklessnes."
3,yawner,Not really anything more than a collection of personal recollaections about three UN employees and their travels around the world.....can sum up the book in three words.....waste....of....time....
2,Different opinions,"I don't agree with the 2 different types of reviews I've read of this CD by the Miggs.Some say the Miggs don't have it,some say they doargument?It's neither,to me they sound like a band still developing, searching for a catchy song and a lot of bands I've heard on the college circuit start out this way and end up making it if they get even 1 hit song.So, how's the Cd? It's okay, it's a bit softy and Poppy sounding, and I don't know if there's a hit song per say on this one but overall I've heard way worse bands selling their product on this site.I think mostly girls would like this record because it's not heavy at all and the lyrics are nice.."
2,Confusing dvd Set,"Overall I was very pleased to get this at first,though it looks as though they slapped this on with a shovel.Not being in the right season is very confusing and annoying!Thats not why they have dvd sets.I could have just gotten cable if I wanted the episodes to be out of order! Otherwise,still very good acting and comedy."
3,Family Ties Fifth Season,"I love the Family Ties series and would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves the 80's. However, we have had trouble with some of the discs working in this set. The first disc was the worst so far. Many of the episodes were not even watchable because the disc kept stopping and skipping. I did not receive a receipt nor a return label from the seller to exchange this item, so I am not sure how to go about getting a different copy. I have never purchased anything from Amazon before that was damaged, so this is all new to me. Any suggestions?Thanks!"
4,good,"I have not watched this dvd yet. But based on previous seasons watched, I am expecting it to be good."
5,Family Ties,"We loved the show while it was airing on TV, and are delighted to be watching the DVD's - they are as funny now as they were then."
3,Ancestral Review,"The author is the great great great great grandfather of my Grandchildren and the artist is their great great great grandfather; so I bought 8 copies. I was very pleased with the service and with the book itself with the one exception. The illustrations, due to the type of reproduction, were very poor, one entirely black. When illustrations were compared to a facsimilie copy of the book the difference was night and day. For the story itself I would rate it five stars. The art reproduction made me reduce the rating to three.ics"
2,"This is New Age Spirituality, not Christianity","I was hoping for insights into the Magdalene's role in the early church. What I got was a bunch of New Age backwash which regards Arthur Pendragon, and Camalot, as historical truth, claims the Garden of Eden was situated on a temperate lost continent seated at the North Pole. Very little Christian theology appears here. The authors claim that the Lord's Prayer as described in the Gospel of Mark has ties to Egyptian Osiris liturgy, yet give no textual evidence to back up this claim. Their basic knowledge of the history of Christianity is even flawed as they attribute Acts of the Apostles to St. John the Devine, when Acts is clearly a continuation of the Gospel of Luke.I almost went with one star, but occasionally something they write has the flavor of truth, before they go off on another tangent about the chakras of Mother Earth.There is text of the Gospel of Mary Magdalene in the book, but given what's around it I'm planning on getting another source."
1,"Looking for history, again!!","I have to admit that I have not ever before closed a book before getting to the last page. Nevertheless I went back to it and persevered hoping to find a morsel of something interesting to read.The authors have tried their utmost to convince us that Jesus, Magdalene, Simon of Arimathea were ""British subjects"", spending all their time wondering the then not so civilised countryside of Britain.AS if that is not enough we we are told that much of what is written in the book has been handed down by devine revelation from Magdalene to one of the authors,claiming that this historical fact.My advise to those unsuspecting persons considering spending good money buying this book is to donate it to a worthy cause.The best part of this book is its cover."
3,Nothing new,"If you have read the Gnostic Bible teachings that were excluded from the real bible, the Gospel of Mary Magdalene is in there. It does not have much because it has been eaten away by time. We will never know all that she knew. This book does not have much more. Sorry I was hoping this would have more, but the information is not much different than what you can get from the other alternative gospels."
1,First Book I ever Returned to Amazon for a Refund!,"Absolute FICTION. This book should be labeled FICTION, it is ABSOLUTELY NOT HISTORY! When a book is ""channelled"" , this should be made absolutely clear in the info & description given about the book and should not be catagorized as HISTORY! This is the first book, out of 100's that I have ordered from Amazon that I have returned for a refund. I am willing to eat the shipping charges on the return, which I shouldn't have to pay - as this book is mislabeled by the publisher!"
1,She Doesn't Know What She's Talking About,I'm a senior at Berkeley High School. Her characterizations are completely off-base and every student I know who read her book was incensed. I'm not the only one who can't wait to get out of this goddamn town and away from Meredith Maran and her posse of dogmatic hippy fascists.
1,Silly,"This book is a terrific example of the bad thinking common in the bay Area. Ms. Moran blames all sorts of people for the problems the kids she studies face, but never looks at real accountability. Her suggestion to banish private schools is symptomatic of a larger left-liberal problem: the inability to think about what is real. I'm sure just how stupid this idea is has never occured to her. She probably thinks her book will lead to a law overthrowing a capitalist way of life in America. Dream on.Reading this book I felt sorriest for the teachers at the school who believed in classical educational ideas, and were trying to hold the students to individual accountability, free of the ""race card."" My heart goes out to them."
2,Hepburn on Intrigue,"I certainly would like to read a different book on espionage, intrigue, spying as rendered in fiction. The topic is fascinating. But this book is not THE book; it needs a strong rewrite. It might be a wonderful work for someone trying for an advanced degree who submits it to a roundtable of scholars with time on their hands. But Mr. Hepburn is already a Ph.D.; is this his submission? I think the best piece of writing--the one that is always quoted--is the first sentence of the book. It is down hill from there. Check out page 73, where he presents his equation for the idea of character. I hope his lectures are many times more interesting."
3,Get out the magnifying glass!,"If you are looking for a round up of the extensive group of people that contributed to what became known as Bloomsbury, you will be disappointed. There are some players that are generously represented and others, such as Sidney Saxon-Turner, Dora Carrington and Ralph Partridge, barely or not at all. As significant a drawback is the size of many reproductions. Whole album pages have been reproduced, which in and of itself is interesting, but is reduces the size of the photos such that frequently the people are so small as to be recognizable. Many of these photos have been reproduced in larger and more satisfactory formats in other biographies and memoirs. Also strange, even within the context, the quantity of photos of nude children reproduced here. Having just reread Quentin Bell's bio of his aunt Virginia I bought hoping to fill out the visual record. No such luck."
3,I'm in between,Nutty yet poignantHave we found the smoking gun here? I doubt itBloomsbury has a posse!
3,Tone-Zone For Les Paul Bridge Pickup,"From the fist time I picked up a guitar I've been on a quest for a commination of ultimate tones. Searching for a tone that's unique to thee individual guitarist, is a dis-ease/sickness that most of us guitar players have--(obviously I mean this in a good way...because it's truly a beautiful thing). However, I've used these Dimazio Tone Zone's in 2 different Les Pauls throughout the years--bridge position only. I've also used them through several different amp set ups (e.g: Marshall, Mesa Boogie, Bogner, Peavey, Vox, Carvin, Soldano, Fender, A.R.T., etc.)both with"
4,Great TV with amazing features!!,"i bought this tv as my first dip into the HD TV world, and i am shockingly impressed. the sound is amazing, the picture is flawless and the fact that it does NOT have a $300 bulb that needs to be replaced every few years makes it even better. yes, this TV is a monster, it is big and heavy but once you get it where you want it, it is 100% worth it. the features on the TV are great, and the fact that it has 7 inputs (3 of which are HD) means that i can plug in everything without having to worry about switching cables when it comes time to play a game or watch a DVD.Overall this tv gets a 9/10. it would be a 10 if it were not so heavy, that is the ONLY downside."
3,"It's ok, waaaay to heavy","I've had this TV for a little over a year. I've moved it twice and I have to say it SUCKS. 325 pounds on stairs isn't fun, it's big, bulkly and not worth it unless you're in a house you're going to be staying in for a long time."
5,BEST AND BIGGEST 40 INCH TV EVER MADE,Great picture and colorI have had this TV over 6 years and never had any problems with it at all.Has a much better picture in a 4:3: format as well as brightness and contrast control than the Panasonic VIERA TC-P50GT25 50-inch 3D Plasma I just bought. The Pani has a much darker picture so faces in night scene's are much harder to see than my Sony XBR.The only down side is that it was $3000 new and is 300 Lbs heavy.
2,"Nice when it worked, but so much mass","I bought this TV back in 2003. Just yesterday I got rid of it. Had a descent picture and was one of the best pictures out there in it's time. The 4:3 mode looked best. 16:9 was too small and the border lines were distracting. Hooking up a game console showed it's limitations as scan lines and other anomalies werealways present.About a year ago I started having intermittent problems turning the set on.. No picture just a pop.. but sometimes it would work fine.It got to the point recently where it wouldn't turn on at all.. Found out that sony had a problem with 2 chip sets on the main power board. A common problem.I was deciding whether to fix it or now.. After shopping around.. I purchased anLG LCD 46"" TV which BLOWS away the sony in every aspect.. It was 1/4 the price and 1/10 the weight.Tube technology is history.. thank goodness. The weight of this TV is ridiculous. In retrospect.. I would not have bought this TV."

3,Just OK,"I picked this up at a used bookstore recently. The concept looked interesting, and the list of contributors fairly impressive. However 90% of the stories left me with the impression of ""Was there a point to that?"". Stylistically the writing was up to par for each of the authors, but many of the stories themselves were rather disjointed or had a feeling of incompleteness."
1,Couldn't get in to it,"I was a huge Anne McCaffrey fan as a teen, and continue to be an avid reader of Sci Fi and Fantasy. I bought the book long ago because it was an Anne McCaffrey. It seems to sell itself on big names but doesn't deliver. I agree with the comment that the stories seem disjointed and it's hard to see the point. I don't mind reading amusing ""fluff"", but this wasn't even entertaining for me. It's probably a good indicator that there are a bunch of used copies selling for 1 cent, if it was worth anything I'd sell mine, but since it's not it's in the first shipment to Goodwill."
4,Spring Color,It's still a CA winter...no seed germination as yet. I seeded a down slope so some of the seed balls rolled all the way down the slope and had to be reapplied to the slope.
4,Really liked it,"Even though I found the heroine a little irritating, it was understandable, considering her past. The hero was intriguing, especially since he was only mentioned in the first book of this series. Some aspects of the story felt a little loose...but for the most part, I really liked it.This story contains graphic love scenes."
1,Beware of labor warranty,The labour warranty is only for 90 days.If you need repairs after the 90 day period the cost of labor is higher than the value of the product. If available purchase an extended warranty.
2,Not what I expected.,"I looked high and low for a CD/Alarm/Clock Radio with good sound, nice aesthetics, and a small footprint. I thought I found it in this one... I was wrong as usual. The choices for me were slim, $500 for the Bose wave, or $79 for this. You still get what you pay for. The FM reception is fair, the sound is substandard, and the cd mechanism whistles when spinning. The unit is also too light, where pushing firmly against any of the front mounted buttons slides the radio back. The display is way too bright, not adjustable, and hard to read on an angle. I attempted to block some of the brightness with some window tint. It worked well blocking both the shinning light and the ability to see the already dim display. Needless to say it sat on my nightstand, looking towards the wall for a couple of days, then was on Ebay. End of story."
2,Fatal flaw in otherwise perfect clock radio,"Good sound, simpler to use than any other high-end clock radio, good control layout with decent sized buttons, amazingly quiet mechanism, good balance of features, and a small footprint. We loved it until we went to bed.The time display is just awful in the dark. It's a green background with black letters that don't stand out well in the dark. One of us needs glasses and the display is unreadable without them at more than 6 inches. I myself don't need glasses and can read it ok from a distance. However, I hate the fact that the green background lights up the room enough to see shadows on the walls. Not what I want when going to sleep. There's no adjustment on the display.It was apparently designed by an otherwise excellent engineer who didn't understand that people might want to use a clock radio in a dark bedroom."
2,5 minute Snooze.....,"You'll be sorry if you purchase this clock. I searched the net, & looked at Aiwa's site. They said it had adjustable snooze feature. [Not true!] You're stuck with this thing going off five minutes after you hit the snooze bar. It's very annoying when you're really tired and need that extra rest. Otherwise it has many features... 30 radio station presets; program the order of songs on cd; choice of radio, cd, or buzzer for both (2) alarms. Most important, the alarm volume comes on low and slowly builds so that you aren't shocked out of bed. Aesthetically, it's very attractive machine. The speakers are substandard... definately not Bose quality, but ok for an alarm. The clock display is large & easy to read, and the display isn't so bright that it keeps you up at night.AIWA... take notice: add programable snooze time and use better speakers... then you can get 5 Stars."
2,Not such a hot buy,"I bought this radio for my daughters because I wanted a stereo clock radio that had a small footprint and headphone outputs. The radio is fairly small, and it has stereo sound, but the LCD display is pretty hard to see, due to terrible contrast. The radio reception is quite good, but it's wasted because the speakers are tiny and sound that way. I returned one of them for service after 2 1/2 months because the system would ""latch-up"", with the only way to reset it being to unplug it. Labor warranty is only 90 days, and you need to pay postage yourself.Skip this one."
2,Not a clock,"Unless you plan to keep the clock within 4ft of where you sleep do not plan on being able to see the time. The reception is good, the features are good, the setup is OK, but not being able to see the time is a killer. I'm sending it back."
3,Delicious recipes,"I've tried her diet plan years ago, but, as always with dissociated diets, I was constantly hungry and because of it I overate, she's right about fat but she's not at all about using fat free milk and yogurt (this two aspects in reality contradict each other) and fructose which increases tryglicerydes, but her recipes, using full fat products and sugar instead of fructose, or her sweetener, are delicious. I'm giving 3 stars just for them, for the real french diet I suggest the fat fallacy or other books about the so called french paradox, because in France they eat a slice of bread with their cheese.....Another problem I've with this book, like with the others after this, is that it's a big infomercial for her products, I've tried them once while following her weight loss plan and didn't like them (too pricey and full of ""garbage"")."
5,life changing,"Nearing 60 and fighting weight increase, and carbo-addiction, reading this book opened my eyes to the real problems of health and weight loss. No more diets for me, just a great, healthy lifestyle. It took me three reading to get it, so do not get overwhelmed and give up."
4,To many somersize products,"I have purchased all the books and videos that Suzanne Somers has produced. This is the first book I find that is not as good as the rest. I feel it is very repetitive of the last 3 which is understandable to a degree. The main reason I am not happy with it is I find there are to many products that you have to buy directly from her. Her past 3 books were more practical to everyday life without having to special order everything from her and could go directly to the grocery store or farmers market.Aslo I am living in Belgium so it makes getting her products on line next to impossible. She will send them however I once paid 100 dollars for a box of truffles!!!!!!!!!!!Lastly, for anyone who has not tried this way of life I feel it is easy because truly it is not a diet."
4,Loved the recipes,"I bought this book because I love all the comfort food recipes in there. She takes into account those of us that are ""Almost Level One"" in our eating. I didn't read the first part as much because I've read her other books and understand the philosophy (10 lbs and back in a size 8 later). My family balked at the ""tater Tot"" recipe but I'm going to keep on cooking for our health and my weight!"
3,Not inspiring,"Although I am a big fan of Suzanne's 3 previous cookbooks (not her dessert book) I've been disappointed with this one. Everytime I look through it for possible recipes, nothing gets my attention. If you haven't tried her other cookbooks, get them instead of this one."
3,good ideas,"I think the Somersize method is a good one, but in some parts of the country, the meal items are hard to find. In California where produce is plentiful, this is a great plan."
2,not worth it,"I received this printer free with my powerbook G4. Now I know why they have to give it away! The worst part: if you run out of black ink, the printer won't let you print in color until you install a new black ink cartridge and vice versa if you run out of color. I also have to press the paper feed button every time before i can print (why counldn't epson automate this process?). The amount of ink it uses is crazy and expensive and the quality is only OK."
1,"Very poor, I attest","I purchased one because of the low price, but I wish I didn't. Injet printers clog, that's a given, but with my old Canon, all I have to do is use a cotton swab with some alcohol to clean the print head, and the printer will print again.This thing, the printer heads are inaccessible, instead it has a gimmicky program that supposedly clean the heads for you, but after a long sequence of moaning and screeching, the printer heads are still clogged. You just waste your time, ink and paper.If a computer program can ""clean"" a physical object, we should be able to do away with brooms and vacuum and ...Stay away from this one."
5,Very good printer,"This printer has excellent photo quality printing capability. The photos I printed from this printer were of a quality akin to prints from a high quality lab. Given, the tiny price and wonderful capabilities of this printer, i recommend it strongly. Yes the printer heads need cleaning periodically, but thats cool, because the cleaing process is automated. Simply clicking the Maintenance button, cleans the printer head in a matter of 60 seconds or less."
4,Had one just like it before,This model is no longer made by Epson.I had one just like this that went bad on me after 5 years and had so much ink in stock I decided to buy this used one instead of a new one. It came and is doing great as far as this model does. It is a little slow and only prints. I will probably purchase one that I can copy photo's in and make copies next time. This one came with one part missing (paper holder) but I was able to use the one from my old one.
1,This printer is the worst!,"This printer really SUCKS!!! It is loud and slow and has low quality and low cartridge life. It is SOOO loud. You can hear it bewteen two closed doors. However, to the reviewer that said all epson printers are loud and clunky, thats not true. I was looking in a store to replace my aging HP DeskJet 722c and I saw an Epson C66, C86, and a CX6400 multifunction. The C66 and C86 look very similar (the only difference is the print speed and resolution). I printed a sample of both of these. I was amazed, they were whisper quiet! The CX6400 has performance similar to the C66. The only thing these printers have in common is the same Micro Piezo 4 seperate cartrdges and they are the Epson brand. I was very impressed with their quality, noise, speed, and looks (design). So if you are looking for a new printer, don't judge your Epson experience on this hunk of junk. Take a look at their higher end models that don't cost that much more."
1,espon c43 ux = worthless,"i bought this printer a year ago. It was really cheap, till I found out that they probably make all the money from the ink, that manages to run out faster than any other printer I used. So I go on the epson canada website, and they have a ' Will reply within 24 hours ' message. Its been 2 weeks. The printed doesnt print anymore, i got new ink, and all it gives are black lines and a faded yellow on the paper, looks like the head is gone. This is the last time, I or anyone asking me about a printer, are ever going to get an epson one. (wish there was a no star rating)"
1,Don't buy this printer!,"The ink cartridges for this printer are extremely small and are expensive for the amount of printing they can do. Also, if the colour cartridge is out it will not let you print with black ink, even if black is full. In other workds, both cartridges need to have ink in order to print. This has been a very frustrating purchase."
1,terrible,"This printer did not work well at all for me. It goes through ink cartridges about every fifty pages. I have had my printer for about a year, and have only used it a few times. Last week when I turned it on, I heard plastic crunching, and as it turns out, a bunch of the plastic parts inside the printer broke off for no apparent reason. It does not work at all now, so I have to buy a new printer, and it definately won't be an Epson."
3,not to bad,"I bought this printer at the BYU bookstore because it was cheaper than the ink for my old lexmark. It is a bit louder, but it is still nice and compact. I don't like that a little window showing how much ink you have left pops up during printing, because I'm an ink miser. The photos I've printed have been fantastic, and I""m satisfied with it overall."
1,Might be nice if I ever got started,"Well, from now on I will open and check the contents of all peripherals I buy as soon as I get them home. When I finally got around to opening this one up to set it up, I discovered the power cord was missing. The store I bought it at happily lifted one from another box, but a week later (when I once again got around to setting it up), I discovered that the ink cartidges had also been forgetten when the unit was packed. Now the store's return cutoff date has passed and the cartridges are difficult to find; they aren't even currently in stock at the store which sold the printer! So as long I'm here at Amazon looking for ink, I'd figured I'd pass on my experiences. It may be a fine printer once I make it go, but this bad start seems to promise more headaches yet to come."
3,It Is What It Is,"Look, this is a cheap printer and you get what you pay for. Personally, I've used it to print resumes, sheet music and papers for school. It's been fine for all of the above. I've never tried to print a photo on it but I wouldn't waste my time doing that anyway. Since you hopefully didn't pay more than $40 for this thing, you shouldn't expect photo quality. It has lasted me 2 years now, and it prints almost as well today as it did when I got it. It's certainly nothing special, but based on all the ""one star"" reviews below, you would think this thing didn't even work.So yes, it's slow, uses ink too quickly and doesn't print in high resolution. But if you want to save money-- and aren't printing photos or running a home business-- this thing will work fine."
1,Epson C42 Ux,"This is without a doubt the worst printer ever made.It clogs up easily after just printing a few pages,,and the results are black lines,and black dots.Epson tech support says you need to clean the nozzle.It wastes a lot of ink to clear up the problem,and it would not take too long before the problem comes back.Epson has replaced this printer for me three times.The problems are the same from unit to unit.It uses up black ink like crazy during normal use,making it really one of the most expensive inks around based on the small cartridge size.It is noisy,and slow.I can live with that,but the quality of the printing is the pits.I am going to toss this printer out soon.No more Epson products for me.The model should be more accurately labeled the C-42 SUX"
1,"Cheap, because it's slow, noisy, and inefficient.","I thought I was getting a great deal because I got this new for under $30 after a rebate. Boy was I wrong.The black ink lasted me about two months of moderate use, compared to a year of heavy use in my old Xerox multifunction. This means you will be buying lots of ink for this. The cartridges are cheaper than, say, HP cartridges, but as far as I can tell that's because they have 1/2 the ink.It's also very slow, even when printing in black-only.It's very noisy and irritating in true Epson style.And, to top it off, the print quality is very mediocre. You can tell at first glance that the output was from a cheap inkjet.I'm replacing this as soon as I can with a better printer, probably another Multifunction, and probably not from Epson, just to spite them."
3,Good acoustics,"Made in USA in 2001, Serial# DGM-0101, Playing Time 65:19Album 7 for Mr. Bruford's jazz formation EARTHWORKS, and what we get here is familiar sounding performances.The band is the same as on 1999's ""A Part, And Yet Apart"", and the complicity is more obvious: the performers seem to better fit together, and even though the performances are acoustic, the exchanges are well integrated.The disc also contains a video of ""Never The Same Way Once"" recorded in concert (unlike the studio version on the album), and clearly displays how comfortable the musicians are with each other. The songs are better constructed than on the previous album (APAYA), full of subtleties without showmanship for showmanship's sake.A nice jazz album, fairly soft, but not particularly exhilirating."
3,Not so good!,"When I recieved the curtains, the stiching was coming out of them (for the rods to go in ). I didn't want to complain or have to ship them back and pay for postage and wait for them to take a while to come back. So, I kept them and I had to buy a needle and some tread to mend them. Plus they where the wrong color and I had to buy some die and die them the color I ordered. But, they where what I needed in size and came fairly quike."
2,Too sheer,Perhaps my own fault for not paying closer attention to other reviews... but finding these extremely sheer. I'd be much happier if they had double layered these curtains. Instead I'll have to buy additional fabric and make my own.
5,Very Pleased,This is a hard to find curtain size so I was happy to find it here - and at a very good price. The curtains are well made and I would order from Country Curtains again.
5,Great,Everything we expected! They fit perfectly. Looks great. Could be more happier with this product. Would recommend to everyone who has a need.
2,"Good scanner, dubious quality","I had a UMAX SCSI scanner that was a workhorse from 1997 through 2002. I got a LiDE 30 about a year and a half ago, and it has developed a short in the USB port, which causes it to be uncommunicative with the computer unless you hold the cable in the socket JUST right. I am unimpressed with the durability of this scanner. It scans SLOOOOOOOW compared to the SCSI or USB 2 scanners on the market.I would only recommend this for light use home users that do not have any need to move peripherals around, plug and unplug the device, and are amenable to slow scanning speeds."
3,USB2.0 = usb1.1,"Please note, this product is ""usb 2.0 full speed"" which is NOT ""usb 2.0 high speed"" - it's actually what we all use to know as ""usb1.1"". Buyer beware - it's the manufacturer's way of misleading consumers. That being said, the previous reviews claiming better performance using true usb2.0 ports on a computer are not valid (for the bottleneck is always going to be the output of the scanner itself)."
2,Disappointed,"The LiDE 30 is not a great scanner. I am disappointed with the product. I would return it but Amazon doesn't pay for return shipping costs.The design of the scanner is pretty good. It is slim and does not require a power cord. It has three specific autorun buttons on the scanner. However, it would be better to have only one button that opened the main menu. The scanner can be stood and used on its side. The scanner is slow, but fast enough for occcasional use. Legal size pages do not fit on the scanner. Tech support by phone is very good and accessible. Web based tech support is weak.My main complaint is that the driver for Windows XP is very poor. It is not compatible with the Windows XP built-in scanner wizard. The scanner does not show up as a device in the ""My Computer"" menu. The driver does not work well with networked printers. The driver will not accept a networked printer as the default printer. Overall, the driver and software are clumsy."
5,Great Scanner Great Price,Scans are very good and fast compared to what I have experienced in the past. I won't cover the same things already covered many times before.Not having to deal with another adapter to plug in is very worthwhile.Being able to scan multiple photos at one time and have them created as separate files is fantastic. Really cuts down on the effort to scan in old photosIt is less than 1/4 the size of my old scanner and can store on its side (holder provided). It claims you can operate it in the holder(this doesn't appeal to me).
4,"Good picture quality, but very noisey","This scanner has a high picture quality for a very low price. It scans photos with very high resolution and comes with some pretty good software that is easy to use. However, the scanner makes horrible high pitched noises while scanning that take some getting used to.Overall, the Canon LIDE 30 scanner is a good buy and I would recommend it to anyone who likes scanning things."
2,Less than it appears,"Despite claims that this is a USB 2.0 product, it isn't. This is USB 2.0 Full-speed, the poor cousin of the USB 2.0 standard. USB 2.0 Full-speed is only 12MBs, the same as USB 1.1. Buy only a scanner that is USB 2.0 High Speed. And send a message to Canon by buying from a vendor that doesn't try to con their customers."
1,Dirt on inside platten!,"This scanner can with dirt on the inside platten, so my scans are all grainy! Very poor quality control. Read the web, others have had this problem too. Stay away; you'll be sorry.,"
2,Overview,"Inexpensive, but quite slow -- even on a fast machine (G4, OSX).(I have an OLD epson scanner that is much faster.)Powered by USB (no extra power cable -- which is nice.) But why not use Firewire?Maybe good for children, but does not satisfy professional expectations.I expect hardware prices to go down, but do not expect performance to diminish. Overall, a disappointment -- considering Canon's capacity to do better."
1,Does not work with windows 7 or other 64 bit systems,I'm sure the product is fine. But I'd never know. They neglect to tell you that Canon stopped making drivers for this thing. latest you can get is windows XP support. Don't waste your time trying to save some money like I did. Find a newer scanner that will actually work on your machine. If you use Vista 32 bit or earlier then by all means grab it. I'm sure it works fine. But Most people buy PCs right off the shelf from best buy and they come with Windows 7. So this thing wont work.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS 7,"Scanner was great for many years. I recently upgraded to Windows 7, only to find out that Canon does not support it for this scanner. I feel ripped off. Now I need to spend $100 on a new one, and guess what.. It won't be a Canon"
4,So Good So Far (with Mac OSX.2 'Jaguar'),"...Anyhow, it's fine. It scans right into PS7 and OSX doesn't complain. It's not the fastest scanner and I've seen better image quality. For my purposes (and, once again, given that I have PS7 for touching up images) it's quite satisfying. The thin profile and small footprint (plus a stand to store it on its side) make it a welcome addition to my [CRMPD] deskspace.There is an odd 'trick' to get the Canon software to recognize PS7 in OSX, otherwise it may activate the Classic OS instead (and that's not so bad, generally).I have an iMac G4/17"", and I'm not switching."
2,Slow and Grainy Resolution,"I purchased this mostly for it's size, weight and ""single cord"" hook up (it makes it easier to ""move it"" between computers). While all of those aspects make this scanner fantastic... the scan quality, resolution, and speed are very poor. It took over 10 minutes to scan a photograph at 1200 dpi, and even then the quality wasn't great. The included software, however, is a nice added feature. Anyways, I'm returning this scanner and in the market now for something with more speed and resolution (even if it is a bulkier item)."
1,Not good for Mac OSX,"This scanner seems like it would be a good value, but not for Mac OSX users. Mac OSX was an afterthought on this product -- you must download special OSX software from the Canon web site, you must also have Adobe Photoshop 7 and not even the newer version Adobe Photoshop CS, and even then, every time I tried to scan anything Mac classic had to launch. Those are just too many steps and too many restrictions in order to make it a nice experience for Mac OSX users. I recommend avoiding this product if you are a Mac OSX user."
1,The Rube Goldberg of driver installations on OS X,"This is hands down the worst user experience for software and driver installation under OS X. I don't think Canon has actually used a Macintosh. The driver installation stuffit archive expands into an installation application. Launching that produces yet ANOTHER installation application. Somewhere in the process, one of these installation applications launches Internet Explorer (despite it not being my default browser) and displays a bunch of screenshots on how to complete the install. Its all very confusing and Rube Goldberg like. It took me 4 tries to get this thing installed.I also notice that the software uses a fair amount of CPU cycles while idle.I would recommend you skip his product if you are using Mac OS X."
2,Poor color rendering,"There are a few things that make me eat shipping costs and return it:* The biggest problems is poor color rendering. Everything is (signigicantly) shifted towards red-yellow. My old $10-after-rebate scanned performed so much better. Please note same complaint in other reviews.* Any slight bends in the scanned item result in lots of color distortion in this area in the scan. Must be due to use of LED technology.* Once it overdrawn power so Windows had to temporarily shutdown the USB port. It's great it doesn't need the power cord - only if technology was more refined.* Drivers - there are two, one can be used with in-the-box software, and one with Windows scanning software. Here is the kicker - you'll have to choose one of the two, both cannot be installed at the same time.* As many have noted it's slow an anything above standard 150dpi (this is not a USB 2.0 device, the scanner description is a bit deceptive, not everyone knows that USB 2.0 ""full speed"" = USB 1.1 speed)"
4,Good Scanner !,"I bought it, because of Amazon ratings.This is a nice, simple and light piece of equipment.And for the price and features, I bought 2 more for the office.Easy setup made this shop worth the investigation.Only complain: I personally found it a little slow.But everything else is just great."
4,Excellent--for the price.,"I've been using this scanner with Mac OSX (native) for a few months, and I'm very pleased with the performance. When I first plugged it in and installed the enclosed software, it wanted to run in classic mode. After I downloaded some driver updates from the canon USA website and adjusted some of the settings (all very easy), it worked flawlessly in native mode. Beware, however, that Photoshop 7 is required. You can't beat the quality of the scans for the price. Sure, it can be faster, but for average home use, it's just fine."
3,good but slow,"the picture comes out good if you choose a high enough resolution, but don't count in this one if you're in a hurry... good scanner, but very slow."
3,Great Scanner - Lousy Software,Lousy software comes with the scanner... sometimes REQUIRES you to start up another program AFTER the scan is completed. You tell it NOT to initiate the othe program AFTER the scan - and there is a bug in the software - and it keeps asking/demanding for this program..... BAD BUG .... BAD LOUSY SOFTWARE
1,"Canon, thanks for ruining Christmas","Setup was a breeze, the scanner looks nice, and the software is OK. There's just one problem, the scanned pictures look like crapola. At first I tried scanning a magazine cover at 300 dpi and the resulting image looked nothing like what I was scanning, it was all blotchy and the text looked like garbage. Then I switched to 1200 dpi and a regular old photograph. The colors were OK but the outlines of the people looked all jagged like bad Atari graphics from the 80's. Oh and you have to wait like 3 minutes for the 1200 dpi image. I bought another brand of scanner for about 80 bucks five years ago and it beats the daylights out of this thing. Needless to say, I'm going to return this hunk of junk."
4,"Heavy beats, lots of fun","This is a high energy dance song, lots of thumping and lots of expression that will keep you in high gear."
3,(sigh),"Another single from Chicane's never-to-be-released new album, it seems. It's been six damn years since Nick released his last LP; for three of those years, I've been beginning to lose hope that he'll ever release another one. Why have I lasted so long without new material? Because his two albums to date, ""Behind the Sun"" and ""Far from the Maddening Crowds"" are just that good -- even though I can't listen to them anymore."
4,NOT QUITE WHAT I EXPECTED....BUT STILL GREAT!,"As a deeply devoted fan of Chicane, I must say I was a little dissappointed with this, as many hardcore fans around the world will be. However, after listening a few more times, this track really touches you, with its yearning male vocals courtesy of Tom Jones, and the beautiful filtered guitar riffs and soft synth chords. It definitely works a dancefloor, and as a dj and clubber, I can say that i LOSE IT to this! Although not the blissed out and ethereal anthem we had hoped for, Chicane has grown as an artist and this is a great display of a brilliant musician broadening his sound. The drums are tight, the bass is heavy, and the overall feeling takes you to the real sound of Ibiza! If you are new to Chicane, buy ""Behind The Sun"" before this.. If you are a fan, you may be dissappointed at first listen, but give a couple more spins and it will hit you!"
4,Nice job bringing Tom Jones into the electro age...,"A variety of mixes, but the best are the commercial 12"" and the Vertigo Vocal remix...and speaking of ""vertigo"", Chicane has produced a track that has a rhythm guitar and bassline that is reminiscent of classic U2. And Tom Jones--well, his voice has been altered and the effect is brilliant. Sort of like what Chicane did ages ago with Bryan Adams on ""Don't Give Up."" Just keep in mind that this isn't a hard-hitting dance song...the atmosphere is more like what U2's ""I Still Haven't Found What I've Been Looking For"" would sound like if it was remixed with a house rhythm (and it has been in a variety of bootlegs...). However, the young punx mix tries to give it a campy disco house feel--with disastrous results."
1,RUBBISH!!!,"Chicane should just stop releasing material under that guise ever again. FFTMC and BTS were lush and beautiful productions. NIcks latest attempts have been pathetic...from a musical standpoint and from a professional production standpoint...even his older 'pop' remixes for other artists were better than this rubbish he's doing these days...no, we're not saying recycle the older productions, but instead it's a matter of putting the effort and 'originality' in the profuctions...a signature if you will...and hey, it doesn't have to pigeon hole you if done with class...yes, how the mighty have fallen...oh brother..."
2,Just okay,"I only wear this watch because it is CK. But the leather strap is really ordinary(strap is hard leather, i don't get the soft feeling on my hands) and does not compliment well."
3,Good but not great,"I enjoyed this book but had hoped for more. Like another amazon.com reviewer, I was a bit bored by the large portion of the book dedicated to the explanation of why connections are important and showing that interconnectedness in on the decline in our society. I assume that if someone is buying a book called ""Living a Connected Life,"" he/she already believes that there is a need for forging stronger bonds amongst people. I was looking for more ideas -- real, ""do-able"" things -- of how to make my community stronger: to better connect with those around me in a meaningful way. In a nutshell, I wish she had focused less on ""WHY ONE SHOULD Live a connected life"" and more one ""HOW TO Live a connected life."""
2,Scratched after a year,"I'm still hopeful that the coating isn't as poisonous as the regular teflon pans.As other reviews have said, you can't soak this, scrub this, dish-wash this, or anything else fun. And who hasn't let a pan sit overnight with some water in it when you finished dinner late? Bang, the warranty is void and you have some permanent scratches on the pan (apparently water can loosen the finish? not very 'permanent' by my book then).I don't know what else to suggest yet :( We got these for our wedding and are shopping for new ones - expensive for only a year or two of work!"
2,"Fair, but there are better choices","I made the mistake of investing in a set of Calphalon about 4 years ago. Almost immediately, the pans began getting ugly scratches on the outside. It seems to happen no matter how careful you are. On the plus side, the non-stick coating is durable, and the cookware is quite heavy and made well. But for this kind of money, you should get a set of cookware that (A: You can toss in the dishwasher, and (B: Has a more durable exterior finish.Note: To answer another person's comment, this is basically the same set I purchased some years ago at Dillard's department store. The handles have changed slightly, and Calphalon has added a polymer to help the exterior resist stains, but this set uses the same materials and finish as the one I had. And notice Calphalon still recommends hand washing??? You have to 'baby' the exterior finish....using a Scotch-brite pad to get out scratches and scuffs."
2,Not as good as expected,"I was looking for a good set of cookware that might last a lifetime. I figured if I spent around $500 that this should be a very reliable set. I've had them about three months now and two of the pans have nicks in them already. One has a pretty good sized scratch. Never used metal utensils or heated pans too quickly, so I don't know how this could happen. I suppose when the pans are heated the integrity of the coating suffers. Not good for a $500 set of non-stick. I'm thinking now I should have gone with my original thinking and got stainless steel. Clean up is a bit tougher with stainless but with the right product (Kleen King) you can shine them right back up while washing them. My parents have a set of stainless steel that they've had for 30 years and they still look new. What was I thinking?"
1,Nonstick layer peels off,"I purchased this cookware set five years ago. Initially, I was very happy with it. The handles stay cool even with high temps and the food cooked easily without sticking. After frequent use, the nonstick layer started peeling off the pans and I would find flakes of Teflon in my food. I always use wooden or plastic cooking utensils and never metal.Do not put these in the dishwasher or your warranty will be void. I don't do it often but they have been in the dishwasher and even though Calphalon said that wasn't the cause of the problem, they won't replace any of my pans. I won't purchase anything from this company again."
2,not good for flat cooktops,"I bought these because I was remodeling my kitchen going to a flat cooktop and needed new pots. I had caphalon before and they were good but old and slightly warped. They sounded good in reviews and looked good. Nonstick worked well initailly. My wife wanted non stick and light pans. These fit the bill.BUT after less than two years now I am shopping for new pots. The ones I use a lot do not lie flat anymore leading to uneven heating, and rattling when cooking and the non stick is scratched in every pan. I dropped my large soup pot on tile floor (empty, no food adding weight) and it warped enopugh I could no longer get lid on. I gave it away.For the price these are not a good deal. My daughter is thrilled because I will give her these and she has a gas stove. If you have a gas stove the issue of warping is not a big deal."
1,Not worth half the price!,"I bought these pans about a year ago. I was so pleased. I also bought an expensive set of wood utensils and threw my metal ones out. All and all I'd say I spent $700+. At first they were great. Hand washed, wood utensils and never in the oven. My first mistake was trying to cook a pot roast with bone in my Dutch Oven. Big scratch!!! No pan should be so fragile. By the end of the year every pan is scratched and I don't mean one little scratch in the bottom. These pans look worse than my Costco brand after 5 years of wear which they replaced @$150. When I get the guts to tell my husband what garbage they are, I'm going back to Costco."
2,Overated...,"I have used these pans expressly as according to the manufacturer's instructions including throwing out all my spoons spatula's etc and replacing them with silicone and wood. Less than 2 years later the Non-stick surface is both breached and is flaking off. I have read these reviews before and thought the user just didn't know what they were doing, but I can honestly say after making an investment like this we carefully followed all the rules. We have cleaned them according the manufacturers recommendations and they just do not hold up. I was initially very happy with the set but quickly fell out of love with them. I agree with the sentiment that this is NOT a lifetime set but they price it like it is."
1,Buyer Beware,"We recieved these as a wedding gift in 2004 and now I find that we need all new pots and pans. I love to cook and use these everyday. First - they do not heat evenly, I am constantly moving food around the pan to get the right heat. They have been chipping almost since they were new. We take very good care of our things, and always washed these pans carefully and have never used a metal utensil. So what gives? I have a non stick pan I brought to college (a LONG time ago) that has faired better than these. I have to wonder why they are being sold through a clearance company?"
4,Awesome value.... heavy as hell,"This cookware is outstanding in quality.... nonstick it's great and resistaint, glass lids are strong and let you see inside withot having to remove lid.ConsThis things are HEAYV.... trying to flip pancakes can be an aerobic exesise with these....They can be put in a full blown oven for the handles are pure stainless steel... can be hot tough...f3"
2,Up n' away review,"I first got to hear Mr. President in 1996, when they made the whole world dance with their smash hit ''coco jamboo''. Ever since i became a fan and i seeked for their cds. Their debut cd is this one, ''up n' away''. However, this cd didn't came up to my expectations. An annoing cd, with only one good hit, ''up n' away'' (no. 2). All the other tracks are variations to ''up n' away'', so i didn't really enjoyed my choice. For ''fanatic'' fans only."
4,Good Work,"""One Track Mind"" is a little group and its her fhirst CD i think its very sweet and everyone can enjoy with this CD."
3,"good show, bad producing studio","got the DVD, the shows alright, but I hate the sony entertainment logo showing up after every single episode,annoy the hell out of me... and whats with the long lengthy announcement and warnings at the beginning, it not like we don't already know it, and NO subtitles? come on..."
5,When We Break,"This is such an awesome album by such an awesome band. their my favorite band behind the red hot chili peppers and the beatles. best songs are prevent the world, kiss the wake, grey matter, and self help the others are awesome too. if you dont have it get it. i also reccomend anything else on saddle creek, old-school red hot chili peppers, tokyo police club, rage against the machine, at the drive in mars volta, and the ramones"
4,Album Number 2 from Criteria Proves Saddle Creek Correct In Signing Them,"Have you ever heard of White Octave? How about Cursive? Well, both of these bands were founded by Criteria frontman Stephen Pederson. After a long time of struggling to get signed by record labels, Saddle Creek got smart and noticed Criteria. I'll put it this way: Criteria play catchy, riff-driven rock songs with amazingly well-written lyrics. Some people say that these guys sound similar to Jimmy Eat World, and I tend to agree. I highly recommend ""Prevent the World,"" ""Good Luck,"" and ""Grey Matter."" Criteria's live shows rock as well, so be sure to check their tour dates. This CD is definitely worth the buy. I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again."
3,Full of pop-psychology drivel,"I've heard so many good things about John Ortberg, and was surprised to find this book so full of pop-psychology drivel. Maybe it just paled in comparison to Adam Hamilton's ""Why?"", or Paul's writing in Acts. Ehhh. It was okay."
3,The Life You've Always Wanted,The delivery time with this product was horrendous! It took about two months to receive. I don't know if I can check where the origin of the product comes from but I think I found out later that it had come from England and that there is tight security for things coming through the mail or something. I appreciated the updates to track where my books where but not please with how long it took.
5,A book I almost didn't read,"I almost refused to read this book. The title is so lamely, self-helpish. I wouldn't have been surprised if it was sub-titled ""A Journey of Self-Discovery Along A Road Not Taken."" Then the first chapter uses a Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers reference. How closely I came to missing out!His ""Training vs. Trying"" chapter is, for my money and for the person starting out, the best chapter on the spiritual disciplines ever written.He does a fantastic job, throughout his book, of showing from his own life what it looks like to live out the disciplines he's describing. When explaining the discipline of slowing, he talks about his efforts to go to the longest line in the grocery store checkout. How does this technique help you connect with God? He explains it.The book isn't a perfect book, by any means. But it's a good book, a helpful book. And that's what you want if you're trying to branch out in the techniques you use to connect with God."
5,Want to Change? Then Let God Transform Your Life!,Ortberg has written a gem on how God can transform our lives so we may live a life more pleasing to Him and also more fulfilling for us.Among the principles Ortberg mentions are:1. Do not let certain people and gadgets rob you of God's joy!2. Pride is an ancient problem.3. Characteristics of a well-ordered heart.4. God wants to speak to us but we must first listen to Him!5. Excellent thoughts about pleasing God instead of others.6. Principles for meditating on Scripture.7. We are not Superman!8. Excellent notes on the importance of solitude.Read the book and be encouraged to change for the better!
4,Life,I'm still in the process of reading the book as we are using it as a weekly discussion guide for our small group. The parts that I have read thus far have been good for me personally and productive for discussion and thought in our group. This is our 2nd book by this author in our group.
4,Good read,I'm really enjoying this book. Some bits of it read like 'pop spirituality' but there are some excellent nuggets that John Ortburg goes into. Some solid foundational stuff in this book.
4,Fresh View on an Ancient Subject,Ortberg has a way with making the ancient relevant. He clearly presents the reason we should practice spiritual disciplines in the first few chapters. Ortberg uses the contrast between biblical Pharisees and true Christ followers to build a case for keeping the disciplines relational.Ortberg goes through many major disciplines and explains them in terms of relationship with Christ rather than religious duty. This is a fresh look at a Christian essential that is useful for teaching classical spiritual disciplines.
4,Good book full of thought provoking poems,Dark but sometimes whitty poems.if you like counter culture and contreversial themes you will love this short but to the point book! finally a book that makes you think about the future.
2,"OK, but... the movies are cut!","I have heard that Motel Hell is cut the (Brain Spoon part) is missing! And with Deranged Also Known As: Deranged: Confessions of a Necrophile(1974) has a real Runtime of 84 min in the UK, in the USA it was cut! I have a vhs copy that is longer than the USA version with more gore! So watch out for these dvds, To bad MGM did not go the extra mile...oh well"
2,tum-ti-tum,Deranged is a cartoon type of film more amusing than anything ; the serial killer's face is a series of hoaky hilly-billy expressions There is a direct tribute to Psycho at the start but don't expect psychological intrigue in the least.. Amusing at first but soon boring because the film enlarges on stereo-type including the rest of the cast. It appears to have been made for young teenagers.
2,Deranged/motel hell,"Deranged wasn't as gory and scary as it was in 1974 but ok. Motel Hell was good I had seen it before on tv, but much better watching a video, but the last 10 min. of the video wouldn't move and couldn't see what the ending was."
4,"4 stars for ""Deranged""","""Deranged"" is the best reason to buy this rather interesting set. It has so many qualities that most horror films lack. It has shock factor, a genuine plot, disturbing situations and great performances."
4,"Really fun. Motel Hell- 4*, Deranged-3*","Gotta love Motel Hell! Funny, gory, creepy. It certainly keeps you entertained throughout. Calhoun is great, his sister - like something out of a John Water's movie -- is hysterical. This has a little bit of everything. Great garden(!)scenes. Deranged is just creepy. Slimey creepy. Well done because it has a kind of documentary feel to it, but there is something that makes you feel just a little dirty after you've watched it."
3,motel hell,"I liked it. It wasn't as good as my Boss made it sound but itwas worthy of a bag of popcorn. I will never look at cabbagethe same way again. It is not a good movie to watch alone.I watched it alone the 4th time and I could not sleep at allthat night, but I also was having cramps so it could have beenthe beans I had for supper. I just hope they don't make a movieabout me someday."
4,vegetarian propaganda?,"Motel Hell and other B movies of its ilk (ie, Deranged, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) which explore cannibalism with various levels of tongue in cheek while linking them to the eating of ""acceptable"" meat not only can't help but comment on the human choice to be carnivore, but to challenge said choice. Farmer Vincent's got his theories on why it's okay to turn to people into smoked meat for consumption, and he considers himself to be kind to his ""animals"", but, of course, we are put off not only when we see him lopping the carcasses apart, but when we see his ""animals"" before their slaughter; the point is not that in many scenes it is hard to tell the human flesh from the pig flesh housed in the same smokehouse; rather, the point is it that is hard to tell the pig flesh from the human ANY time...and when Farmer Vincent fights his final duel beneath the mask of a slaughtered pig's head, it seems only just that a marriage of this two victim types should take place in him."
4,Great crazy fun.,"Ha what a great combo for this Midnight movie pack. Both are very different but go well together. The first one Deranged is a little messed up for a 70s movie (think sorta a mix of Texas chainsaw and a documentry), pretty solid horror flick with some good crazy acting from the old guy. The best movie though is Motel Hell with it's crazy funny over the top acting and plot. Worth it just for that movie and the pig scene at the end is epic. Highly recommend this double pack."
2,Motel Hell,"It was ok, liked it as a kid, sometimes it's good to go back in time. One good thing price was good.Ilike buying from you guys right now can't think of next movie but I will soon. Thanks Again"
4,Motel Hell,"Thank you for making the video ""Deranged/Motel Hell"" available through Amazon.com!! It has been a favorite Halloween movie of mine & a friend for years. I mailed it to him as a surprise ""treat"" @Halloween this year; he LOVED it!!"
2,Fine when dry. Poor when wet.,"Comfortable, but do not work well when wet. Your feet slip out of them. Sort of surprising for a company that specializes in over priced swim wear and gear."
3,This Scale is for People under 50 yrs old !!!,"This scale I bought mostly for the extras it does besides weighing a person... However, the description did not say that you have to be between certain ages. I am 51 so this does me no good, now I have 2 scales that only weigh us because we are older.. I put all the info in it like it said to do but because I am over 50 it gives me an error instead of the BMI or water scale. So beware before buying.."
4,Perfect Remote,"After searching for a true universal remote control I finally found one. The remote is easy to program. I am searching for a way to reprogram the buttons. This remote even controls my roomba robotic vacuum cleaner. Flexibility is what this remote has. Was impressed with the macros that you can build to do multi functions, and they really worked the way I wanted them to. It did take a few tries to get them to work but once I got it to take it worked. The price was right for the power it has. Love the remote got rid of 6 remotes off my table. Easy to hold and not to big to handle."
4,Good product,"Thisproduct couldbe beter if couldbe a liter samaller, the tother features are very good"
2,Desperately needs an editor,"Mr. McManus book ""Alamo in the Ardennes"" was a great read and prompted me to find his other works. This book however does not live up to the previous and it really appears that Mr. McManus could have used a better editor for this work. There are several pages with identical sentences written in them and often the prose jumps from one subject to the next and back again in a jerky rough draft sort of way. There is some good data and perspective in this book but it feels like a bad Ambrose quote compilation, not the best of the genre."
2,uninspiring,"This is one of the less interesting books I have read on WWII, and I have read over a hundred. This author reveals nothing intimate or noteworthy in his musings, and really just rehashes what has been told time and time again"
3,The Deadly Brotherhood,A comparison of the American and German Soldier. From equipment to training to action in and after battle. Never-the-less a slow but interesting read.
4,A good book,"John McManus has compiled several comments from the men (and women) who were in combat, and creates a very interesting insight into the minds of the soldiers on various details. From the food, to being wounded, he is able, through the words of others, to give us the tale of life as a combat soldier.My only complaint in his style is I want to hear more from the soldiers. Generally a short paragraph is taken and together with other narratives, form the story. He pulls it together very well, and I enjoyed the book. 'Worth reading' at the very least, 'worth owning' as well."
4,A very informative read,"I picked this book up a few years ago and finally got around to reading it this year. It's a highly informative collection of anecdotes from American soldiers during World War II, covering various aspects of combat, training, reviews of weapons and differences between the two main theatres of war. Some of the more mundane parts concern the equipping and feeding of American troops, but overall this book provides quite a bit of insight into many aspects of the lives of American soldiers. If you're looking for a book with nothing but combat, this won't be the book for you. But if you're looking for something which covers a wide range of experiences from soldiers, rangers, paratroopers and marines this is a pretty good read."
4,A Very Good Deal!,The ring does look very pretty when you see it in person...The diamonds are small but very nice looking...I bought it as a replacement anniversary ring for my wife & so far (after a month) nothing's wrong with it...Looks well made/durable & yeah the top diamond sticks out quite a bit (just a warning) but other than than a very excellent deal considering the good price tag.
4,Cool Ring,"I bought this ring for my g/f, it looks great on her hand and most of all she loves it. It has 17 diamonds in all and its and odd 2-piece ring. Nevertheless uniqueness is greatness. Beware though, its yellow gold....so its a tiny bit dull compared to a shiny gold. Its a good buy, oh, but the centre diamond could give you a bruise if someone else passes their hand, ah ha.don't touch. Great ring!"
4,One Happy Camper,"I purchased my printer back in August, and never had a lick of problems with it. I've read some of the other reviews, and I have to say I'm surprised to hear about the printer totally loosing connection with the PC. I think it may be an isolated situation, the one reject printer that should have never made it to the store kind of thing.I love my psc 2110!!! I had my daughter trash her Compaq printer and gave her my psc 2110 for school work. My mother loves not having to go to 7-eleven or the library anymore to make copies of needed documents. For myself, I now plan to purchase the HP 5510, for the fax capability.Thanks HP!"
1,Dangers & Regrets on Windows 98 Second Edition,"I never did get the printer to work. The instructions were excellent and easy to follow. The copy feature copied excellently. The demo page printed. The USB port plugged in and configured itself. The software installed properly. But I never could get the computer to print to the printer. It would hang up & lockup the computer every time -- even the test page! The scanner even scanned to the computer (proving that the communications were working). Not only did the HP not work -- it corrupted the totally unrelated drivers for my NETWORKED Minolta-QMS DeskLaser! I had to reinstall the DeskLaser drivers after I uninstalled the HP drivers & software. HP's support docs had a LONG list of possible problems with Win98SE -- even the USB cable might not work! I gave up. Returned everything, got a parallel port printer (which worked instantly & perfectly) & am now shopping for a separate USB scanner."
1,fine while it works,"I used the scanner mostly. Didn't do black and white very well at all. Wouldn't even pick up ekgs. Color it picked up pretty well.The whole unit died a year after I got it. I may have printed 30 things tops on this printer. Beautiful photo printing. Of course, this does me no good when the whole thing dies shortly thereafter.Great potential if it had stayed alive."
1,the HP 2110 printer..,"I bought this printer a couple of months ago because I don't have a computer and it can print and copy without one. I haven't used it that much and I get the ribbon cable marks too on every picture I print out. I only use the print feature to print out pictures, so it's not just the scanner that has a malfuntion. The marks are underneath on the glass, and there is no way to get to it to clean it. Don't buy this printer...it's a waste of money!!"
2,"Shoddy Workmanship, Good Customer Service","Just bought this thing. The first one worked for 1 hour, then made a bzzz sound. That was followed by a burning smell and smoke coming out the side. The replacement one wouldn't even turn on once (I tried multiple power cables... the replacement was DOA). I'm awaiting my third one. On the bright side though, HP customer service is first rate, and they said I would eventually get one that worked and would even upgrade me if this next one didn't work for any reason."
2,"Solid printer, horrible scanning/software and LOUD!","Beware - this printer is noisy! And it likes to do self-tests every once in awhile for no apparent reason - that is, if you place it in your bedroom like I did it WILL wake you up at 1:30 in the morning to do its little 30-second cartridge exercises. Very annoying.The included software is amazingly hardware-intensive. It slowed down my 2.4Ghz Dell like you wouldn't believe. And you can't just install the driver - to use the printer you have to install everything from the included ads to the ocr software no one uses.The scanning is really bad quality in Windows XP - I don't know if my scanner was messed up or something, but the scans were really light and grainy, and the software didn't help in my trying to fix them (and I'm good with computers).I recommend going with a Canon or one of those new Epson multifunctions."
5,Great results and user friendly!,"I looked at the HP, Lexmark, and Cannon multifunction printers. I decided on the HP PSC2210, and I haven't been disappointed. I am using Windows 2000. Just followed the installation instructions carefully and it worked perfectly right out of the box.I am very pleased with the quality prints on everything from photos to scans to text. I have been stung in the past by hardware and software that I purchased only to find that installing and/or using the product was extremely difficult. The PSC2210 is very user friendly. I would recommmend it especially to people who don't want to have to memorize a 400 page manual in order to use it."
5,Great scanner! No problems at all for me.,"I'm surprised to hear so many negative comments about this printer. I've had it for about three years and it's worked great. Printing, scanning and copying. The cartridge holder broke and HP sent me a brand new printer without any hassle at all and I think they sent it overnight. The software that comes with the package is very easy to use as well. I would highly recommend this great priced and efficient printer."
1,Most other review will change,"The five star reviews will change soon after these have this printer/scanner for more than six months. Too many things to go wrong and customer service is terribls with HP/Compaq. I always knew Compaq was junk, but now HP is dragged down too."
3,It is just ok,I had a older computer when I bought this printer because my previous scanner broke and I thought why not get a multifunction printer and not just another scanner. The theroy was good but it didn't work on my computer because it was older. So I got a new computer (needed it anyways). Now the printer works great but it is very LOUD and I had to call the company and get the updated software. I registered with them when I first bought the printer one would think that they would have contacted me letting me know that there was an update to the software (version 2.0). I just hope it continues to do well we shall see.I like the idea of the multifunction but would not really recommend this one because of the problems. Even with the new software it took 3 tries to get it loaded on my new computer..
1,Won't last long,"This printer works great for a while, however, too many things to go wrong. If you need a printer/scanner for more than six months, you should look elsewhere."
3,Windows 98,I have Windows 98 & I have no problems with this product. It works fine for me. I have the software control that I want and it prints the best pictures.I don't like the self check thing it does. It scares me sometimes so I have to cut it off when I'm done with it. It as not the quietest machine that I have ever used. It is ranking with the Lexmark in that area.But the most important issue is that I get the quality print that I can get. I am satisfied. It beat out the Epson (Which is a piece of trash) and the Lexmark which jams with every other page.Maybe when I'm ready for a new one they will have mastered these all-in-one machines. Right now I have to settle for this.This is the best of the 3 evils. As long as it works!
1,"XP - bloated software, & no 48-bit w/out Photoshop!","HP only lists it in some of their specs, but the scanner only scans at 48-bit if you have an external application that can handle 48-bit scans (such as Photoshop). HP claims that software that can handle 48-bit color is too expensive to include with the scanner. If you do have Photoshop, and you turn on 48-bit color processing, you'd better be prepared to wait. It made the image preview time go from a few seconds to a minute or two. And that's just the preview - not even the final scan! If you scan in regular color depth (24-bit), the scans are pretty low quality, with a jpeg-esque fuzziness at all the color edges - and that's scanning as a TIFF. The OCR is useless - I could type it faster than it would take to fix all the problems!Software is really, really bloated. I downloaded the update from the HP website- it was 164MB! Yes, I typed that correctly. One-Hundred & Sixty-Four Megabytes! And if you ask me, it wasn't worth 16k."
1,Taking It Back To The Store,"From the very start after installation, I have had mystery paper jams, that were non-existant. And when I was able to get it to print, the photo copy was poor. I cannot recommend this product. The only positive thing I have to add is that the installation of the software and device was easy on Windows XP."
1,Horrible software and drivers,"Summary: I hate it.Pros:* The photo output is decent for a multi-function. Not nearly as good as the canon or Epson photo printers, but decent.* The scanned images are good quality.Cons:* The software is awkward, bulky, SLOW, not well thought out and occasionally asks for the installation CD so that it can completely re-install itself. If this were the only con, this alone would be reason to stay away from this printer.* The black only printouts are light.* It's very noisy* Did I mention slow?* The small arm that guides photo paper into the unit is flimsy."
2,Uninvoling characterizations,"I love Joan Wolf romances. I find the intensity and depth of feelings expressed by her characters truly unique and impressive. This book was the exception. It was well written and the background story was well thought out, but this was a romance novel and I just absolutely did not like the heroine and hero...I never warmed up to them and as a result, I really didn't care if they got together or not. I found her to be spoiled, shallow and bigoted and to me he lacked charisma. I was really disappointed with this book, but I admit that I will still buy Ms Wolf's next book without hesitation."
1,Such Disappointment !,"I am so disappointed. I adore Joan Wolf books and have been eagerly awaiting this one for months. However, I find myself struggling to finish each page. The writing is so juvenile, and Alexandra is possibly the most annoying heroine ever. All she does is complain, and speak ""coldly"" to people. What I loved about Joan Wolf's previous novels was her ability to develop relationships between both characters. This novel is not original. I find it hard to belive that Joan Wolf wrote this. The storyline and encounters between Niall and Alexndra are boring. I don't feel the sparks between them. I feel like yawning. For all of you who loved The Gamble, Pretenders etc, do not buy this one. The writing style is radically diff. from the previous books and very much like the generic romance drivel you find elsewhere. Sorry fans. This one doesn't cut it."
2,"Deja Vu, All Over Again","I just finished reading SOMEDAY SOON and ...I just finished reading SOMEDAY SOON and... is there an echo in here? Reading Ms. Wolf's latest is like reading two or three of her earlier books. This isn't a new book - it's a patchwork quilt of her previous works. There is a line about Helen and Hecuba that is right out of A SCOTTISH LORD. It's a good line but, unfortunately, you can only use it once. Alexandra reminds me of Catriona from THE REBELLIOUS WARD and the obsessive cousin is a complete lift from AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE. If you have read none of these books - you'll enjoy this one, although it's not one of her best. But if you have read the earlier books, I'd advise skipping this one - unless you have a thing for echos."
2,A disappointment,"I choose books to read based on two factors: either I like the author and enjoyed his/her previous books, or the storyline looks promising. I've never read a Joan Wolf novel, and I don't think I will after this. I expect a romance to carry me away to another world - a world full of passion, seduction, maybe even a little intrigue. This book fails on all accounts. The passion is promising in the beginning, but completely fades out about half way through the book. There was absolutely no seductive scenes, I could not even tell if they had done anything intimate. And finally the villians were so weak that they weren't even an impact in the storyline. I rarely put a book away without finishing it - but I was sorely tempted to do so with this book. I was deeply disappointed and recommend that you look elsewhere if you want a truly romantic escape. -TEP"
2,Terribly Disappointed,"I love Joan Wolf's books, but this was a huge disappointment. It was nothing like her other books. This was a nothing but a formula romance. I find it hard to believe she wrote this, as it is so bad and so different from her other books. There was no character development; both the hero and heroine were shallow and uninteresting. I hope her next book isn't like this one!"
1,"YES, IT REALLY WAS THAT BAD---","Why go to the trouble to write a book and make the heroine so darn annoying and the uninspiring hero so absolutely beastly to the annoying heroine until the VERY end of the story when he exclaims...Oh yeah, love you too...??? Besides all that, the convoluted plot stunk, the ""mysteries"" were non existing, and the end of the book left me wondering how I could have wasted so much time."
3,3 and 1/2 stars really...,"this is one of the better christian perspective on other religions outlines ive read. scientology, native american faiths should've been covered."
2,Cant Judge a Book By Its Cover,"Very disappointing. Very little info on compact tractors, lots of glossy pictures of (some) tractors and accessories and lots of non-tractor task equipment. Rather lengthy academic discussion of tractor based economics (rent or buy? cost to operate? etc), but NO REAL info on how to choose or use implements. For the potential compact tractor buyer, some but insufficient information to sort out capacity, need, and merit amoung the myriad of choices, but this would not help one make that final decision. As a tractor owner, I found little merit in this book. Recommend looking elsewhere if your are wanting to get more use from your existing tractor."
1,Tractor Bible Book Review,"This book is not much help. It is just a group of advertisments placed on slick paper and bound together. There is not any technical or practical information included. If this is a bible, I sure wound not waste my time studying it for any reason other that to gain knowledge of what is available in the market place."
3,"OK, but probably not worth the money.",Not nearly as informative as I had anticipated. Very generalized information. Would not spend the money again.
5,Everything You Need to Know about Small Tractors,"Power, price, performance, and design of various small tractors are discussed and compared. Informative photos explain each model's pros and cons."
2,What Junk-Software Sucks,"What a waste of money. Purely a disaster. Lucky to get 2 scans without errors. Total frustration. messages:Scanner busy, scanner warming up; scanner not ready; scanner not available.This makes the old Microtek look like a dream machine.I have another Epson at home and the Smart Panel software is not so smart- there too- errors, lockups. I hope nobody else buys this garbage. Poor support terrible software."
1,This thing is a piece of junk and...,"Really slow, low quality,[weak] software and no power switch. And good luck getting technical support! My emails got bounced and I could not get through on the phone. ... So here's the summary: bad product, bad service, ..."
1,Apex who?,"I just unpacked the product a short time ago and found all the parts missing I need to scan slides.I notified Apex and they said it would take a day or 2 to resolve the problem. After a week, they say they are still working with the warehouse to solve the problem.I can't review the product, but I wanted to complain to Amazon - how could they associate with such a sloppy outfit?"
1,"Save your money, there are better ones","I could not install this scanner in my new computer. There were problems with the software with windows XP. The bundeled photo editing software that came with it was the only part that did install; did not need it as I have much better ones now. The drivers and the smart scan function would not install. After many tries and several frustrating days, I returned it to the place I bought it on advice from some other experts in computer science.I cannot recommend this to anyone as one other person rated here, It is a dog. I then bought an HP unit that installed easily with no problems and it works great. My advice is to spend a few extra bucks and avoid the hours of frustration that I had."
5,Great!,"It's the scanner for you. Allows for scanning slides and negatives, not to mention flatbed scanning. Running OS X? No need to worry. Just download the driver from Epson, and away you go. Running on Mac OS X 10.2.3"
2,Very hard to read!,"I bought this book from Amazon and wound up returning it for a credit because it was totally unreadable. The very tiny, bold-faced type is, on most of the pages, set against garish green and pink blotches of color, making it a migraine-inducing read. It's probably not a bad book, but the way it is laid out makes it more of a headache than it's worth."
4,Strange...But in a Good Way,"I sent this to my brother as a birthday gift while he was living in another country, but looking forward to his return to Southern California. He was very homesick at the time, and since he also has a perverse sense of humor (he loved the Dr. Demento Show growing up) this ended up being the perfect gift. Another plus was that it wasn't very expensive to ship, thank goodness."
4,Excellent book about the weird and interesting in LA,A fine book about the weird and strange side of LA that you dont read about in regular guides. As a British ex-patriot who has lived in Los Angeles for many years I found this book interesting and accurate. Just as the subtitle says...
1,"Cheap, Poorly Made, Terrible Purchase","This product is extremely disappointing. The clock is plastic and looks very cheap. The distressing on the clock I received looked like someone painted stripes on the sides. It is now sitting in a box in my basement because I'm too embarassed to hang it, but don't want to waste more money to pay to send it back"
3,first one was broke,"I received this clock and it did not work. I emailed Amazon for a replacement and they did take care of it, although it took a little awhile to actually get the replacement. The second clock appears to be working fine."
1,This Clock Drives Me Crazy!,"What could have been a beautiful clock for my wall has ended up driving me crazy. The hour hand will not point directly to the number, so you're always asking yourself: ""Is that almost 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock. If you look at the picture, you can see the hour hand is out of adjustment just enough to make it annoying. I tried to open it up to see if I could fix it, but no go."
5,Great underrated comedy!,"The characters in Caroline in the City: The Second Season got better as they got used to each other. The relationships between the characters really blossomed in this season. The only thing I wish hadn't changed were the credits; the opening credits show other comic strips rather than just the Caroline in the City strip. There are so many episodes since they are a half-hour long, this television show was a good choice and a good value!"
5,"Caroline in the City DVD, the Second Season",This DVD of Caroline in the city (The Second Season) was fantastic. A good follow up to the 1st Season of Caroline in the city.
5,Beautiful read,"I read this book as a child, I wanted to read it to my granddaughter. It's a really good story for children. I would recommend this book for ages 5 to 10 year olds."
4,Less than 2 OCR pages per minute,"This is a good scanner, but I was looking for an improvement over my fine CanoScan 650U. I'm determined to make scans for OCR at a rate of 4 pages per minute. My CanoScan 650U gets 2 pages per minute and I've had it for 2 years. I figured a USB 2 connector and a newer CanoScan might do what I needed.Here are the results of my tests. Scans with CanoScan LiDE-20 were slightly slower than my old CanoScan N650U (usb 1). Apparently, the speed is controlled by the mechanism, not the USB port. As best I could tell, the moving parts were essentially the same.Reviewed Scanners (scans alone, OCR done later):CanoScan N650U: 5 pages, 2.5 min (good accuracy)Visoneer 8800: 5 pages 1.25 min (very poor accuracy)CanoScan LiDE 20: 5 pages 3.4 min (good accuracy)The search for a fast OCR scan continues..."
3,Mac OS X Software Works Like Beta,"The Canoscan software is nice and graphical, and the buttons do work with the Mac. However, the software has some quirks. Opening the Canoscan program, without even scanning, shoots CPU usage up to 100% and it stays there until you quit the program. Selecting which program is associated with the buttons is odd, because it sees applications not as applications but as program groups -- a confusing experience but that is minor overall. The only real disappointment is that the copy button does not really seem to work very well -- it takes 40 min for the print to come out. You can have better success saving files and printing them separately. Quality is fine. If you can find it for $40 like how it used to be, it is a real deal. I recommend this unit if you might occaisionally have to copy or scan a document, but I wouldn't want to have to use it all the time."
3,Good for Travellers,"I have a job that takes me to Switzerland, Paris and London for months at a time. I take this scanner with me, for personal use, and it's great since it has no power cord and just plugs into my computer -- that's one less power-adapter that I need to lug along with me. On the down side, the software is crap and often freezes on my Windows system. All in all, decent for the price but try to find better softward."
4,More Than Expected,"This scanner is certainly a lot higher quality than one would think, especially considering the cost. I feel like I should be sending Canon MORE money.Image quality is greatly improved if you read the instructions and use the advanced options, but even without it, I rarely have to fiddle with anything.This scanner is great for average use, but if you're wanting more professional quality, I'd go with a different scanner."
4,Handy Little Device,"I'm a full-time student, and wanted a simple to use, compact, rugged and light-weight portable scanner that would run from my Laptop's battery out of the USB port. (I planned to use it in the library, to save on note taking, and also trees!) Anyway, I got exactly what I wanted, my only complaint is that I keep forgetting to unlock the carriage, this is more anoying than anything so far, but an on-screen prompt or warning would be handy for future models. So far it is going like a champ, and has exceeded all of my requirements."
4,Good value,"This scanner is a tad bit slow, but overall it's a good scanner and you definatley can't beat the price!"
1,This product can fail to work,"Scanner would not ""UNLOCK"". The travel safety mechanism failed to unlock and made the unit unusable.Canon offers replacement as part of warranty. Endless hours of troubleshooting"
1,Maybe it's me?,The software is difficult and confusing to use and the scans are very poor. I had an HP before and it was so simple and took super scans. I only replaced it because it didn't work with the new operating system. I'm returning this one.
1,canon lide 20 canoscan,"if you are a new computer user, dont buy this product. it was extremely complicated to install, you are required to install a new driver and delete the old driver. trying to install the new driver was so time consuming and complicated that it is not worth the trouble. this will be the last time i buy a canon product."
3,Compact - generally a godo deal.,"Canon generally makes good product. However, the documentation for software is weak. Be prepared to spend some time to feel your way around the packaged software. OmniPage SE works fairly well. The bundled software and size of this scanner makes it a gem. As someone else said, you could even bring it into a library. Recommended."
5,Wow. What a bargain!!!,"I was in the market for an inexpensive scanner. I tried 2 different HP scanners, neither of which were worth the plastic they were cased in. They were both returned to Staples and as a last resort I picked this one up from Circuit City for $49.99. Plugged it right in to the USB port on my XP machine and was up and running. The Canon software is great, far batter then HP I must say. Quality of the scans is fantastic. It is not super fast but it scans at a good pace. The best part is that it turns scanned documents right in PDF files which is nice. I would HIGHLY recommend this scanner for an expensive solution for your scanning needs."
4,Easy scanning and no power cord,"I needed a scanner to put pictures on a web store. This is perfect for that. The scanning is easy (one touch). Even better, I don't need to plug it in; it uses the power from the USB cable. I recommend this scanner for those needing an inexpensive, lower resolution scanner like I do. If you need higher resolution try the LIDE 30 or one of the higher end scanners. I've used HP and Microtek; both worked great. It takes 15 seconds to do a scan which is acceptable to me. Also, the software that comes with the scanner was enough for me to manipulate the image as needed."
4,Fine by me,"I am a photographer with many images that only have prints available. I was in a jam a needed to scan a B&W print cause I couldn't fine the negative. I dusted off my trusty $1200 Nikon ax 1200 only to discover this 40 lb monstrosity I have been storing for 5 years does not work properly anymore. I was in jelly by then. I rushed out picked up this little gem, i figured 1200 x 600 is enough for an 8x10 print scan. I examined some other scanners but they were too expensive, up to $200 and didn't really offer any more usefull features (you will not get decent 35mm film scans with any scanner less than $400, trust me). I went home installed, I used the twain plugin and my scan was out the door in no time. Great size, good image quality, less cable mess, no external power brick. The only way to improve is to make it wireless."
4,not bad,"Well i don't know too much about scanners since this is the first I've ever owned but it works great, and the photos look great. Plus it comes with this really cool photo editing software. And it's really really flat and compact so it takes up very little room on my desk."
2,Great when it works.,I had to replace 2 within a short period of time. I bought an extra one to have as a back up on the control went bad on that one. As well as the batteries won't hold its charge after only having it for less than a year.
3,great movie..... not so spectacular BR disc....,I loved this movie.... and boy is it packed with star power from McRea and Veronica Lake to Lloyd Bridges and Donald Crisp and lets agree that Andre De Toth knew how to direct. I'd give this a solid 5 star review if the BR disc was priced at $15 and was a beauty to behold. As it is ...its $25 bucks and not restored ...full of dust and other issues which should be addressed at this level of price in today's market place. I'm happy to own this disc but I can't give it any more than 3 stars when you consider its high price and low quality of image.I've had good luck with Olive Films blu rays but it seems they just spit out whatever they get so I'll proceed with caution going forward. The Trap starring Richard Widmark was another of theirs I picked up today and its just a dreadful transfer.... truly horrible and again $25.
3,Great psychological film noir!,This is an interesting western about power struggle and doing whatever it takes to get what you want! Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake give good performances and look for a young Lloyd Bridges!
4,Film noir Western,RAMROD is a superb little 'film noir' western; McCrea and Veronica Lake mesmerize. This film repays re-viewing.
3,It doesn't taste like pineapple,"I suppose I may be fussy, but this jam just didn't impress me. It's too sweet and seems to lack the tart 'kick' one expects from eating pineapple. I suppose I'll just have to go back to making my own."
4,Nice little phone,"I've had this phone for a few years now, I bought it shortly after the model was released. It's a nice phone with clear sound, and I never noticed any hiss that others described.It was important to me to have an extra charge spot for the spare battery which this unit does have.Range on the phone is outstanding. When I first got the phone, I took it outside and walked about a block from my house before it started to cut out.My only problem is that now after several years of use, the batteries are not holding a charge very well at all. One battery is practically dead and will not charge at all.Now my only question is do I search around for replacement batteries, or upgrade to a 5.8 GHz model."
4,works well for us,We have had good reception with it. The sound quality is fine and the answering machine works well. I purchased after my panasonic 2.4 gig decided that all my calls were out of range even when I was standing 1' from the base a short 12 mo. after buying it. The at&t has been more reliable.
1,Not Happy,"Got the phone 4 months ago with a rebate ... . Should've saved my money. Feature set and construction is quite good, but actual operation is unreliable. Caller ID function is sporadic-- most times I have to check my $35 corded phone to see CallerID information since the ATT LCD is blank. Although range is good (I've got a decent signal 10 floors down outside with little obstruction), it now cuts-out quite often, leaving you scrambling for another phone in the middle of a call. No problems with the answering machine. Overall, my suggestion is look elsewhere for a phone. In fact, this is the second ATT cordless I've owned in the past two years, both of which have had significant problems. I thought ATT made good stuff -- now I wonder."
2,Watch out for quality problems with this phone,"I bought this at Staples 6 to 9 months ago, primarily to get greater range and to take advantage of the speakerphone feature. The phone has been a mixed blessing. While I noticed immediately additional range compared to 900Mhz phones, I was disappointed with the quality and design of several features. First, while Caller ID remembers many numbers, there's no convenient way to erase all the numbers- so your phone will always say ~24 Calls. This may bother you and may not. Also, the microphone built into the answering machine is really horrible. As you record your outgoing message, no one will really be able to tell it's you. For some, this may not be a big deal-- for us, having a garbled outgoing message is truly annoying. Finally, the extra units you may eventually look for as you expand are far too expensive compared to others. Consider Siemens or GE's new models instead if you're looking to watch your wallet."
2,Hiss? You'll find a pattern.,"I have a problem with constant hiss as well, but on my HS-8270. I'm in the market for a new 2.4 GHz phone with speaker, CID/CWID, and an answering machine. I was down to this one and the Vtech 2461. I've given up on finding a good one with a base keypad (forget the Panasonic or the Uniden!).Looks like this background hiss may be pervasive in AT&T's line. Looks like I'm going Vtech."
2,Great features... awful quality.,"While this phone possesses all the features my ideal 2.4 Ghz should possess, the quality of the phone is absolutely horrendous. The reception inexplicably cuts out, callers occasionally sound far away and the phone emits a loud hissing sound every 25 calls or so that's readily fixed by smacking it with your hand. AT&T needs to revluate their manufacturing process because based on all the other reviews, it's obvious AT&T seriously missed the mark on this one."
1,The worst cordless phone,"I bought this phone three months back since it had many features for a reasonable price. I should have been cautious. There must be a catch somewhere. Well, exactly on the last day of third month, the caller ID stopped working. The store won't take it back because they had 40 day return policy. The only hope of repair now is to spend money in sending the unit back to manufacturer. They do not have stores where I can give it for repair. If they decide to replace it, the replacement will be a refurbished phone. How would you like to get a refurbished phone in exchange for a brand new one ? Take my sincere advise, do not buy this phone. I have wasted money and learnt my lesson."
2,Annoying sound quality,"I have also noticed the presence of background hiss or static while talking on the handsets -- even when standing next to the base unit. Most annoying, though, is the sound quality of the voicemail. Both my outgoing message and messages left by callers sound like they've come through a long tunnel. I expected an improvement in sound quality by moving to a digital answering machine but have been disappointed.All-in-all, a disappointing purchase."
5,"Great Business, Good Product","I have done business with TCP Global as both a private and a commercial buyer. The service is professional and prompt, the prices are competitive, and the products are precisely what I expect to receive. I would exchange a slightly higher price for the service I can count on from TCP Global.The blades themselves work well under the pressure of heavy, commercial use."
2,"Great Product, Watch Your Seller","I got this item in great shape - no rust etc, X-Acto quality, but - Be careful where you buy this. My seller's shipping policy (which I read AFTER receiving the item) DOUBLED ITS PRICE becuase I live in Hawaii. It arrived by USPS Prioriy Mail (Amazon Standard Shipping), the cost of which is minimal, but the seller used my location as an excuse to add an OUTRAGREOUS SURCHARGE."
2,Anne Rice Wannabe?,"Hey, the author is young, she likes vampires, and that much shows in her fiction.Problem is, the story is unoriginal, the characterizations are non-existentent, and the plot is cliched.Still she managed to get the book published. So, two stars for perserverance, and not listening to her editors/critics."
4,This book gives you a thorough basic understanding in MLM,If you are new to MLM this book will give you a clever insightful and factual view of network marketing pitched at the new initiate. I really liked it!
1,"Biased books, lacks credentials and authoritative references","This book is rather personal narrative than academic paper or study. On every page the author makes a number of conclusions, shows ""facts"" without any decent references. Thus, I can not call it research/study and it is very regrettable that it was sponsored by such reputable institutions like the MacArthur Foundation and the London School of Economics and Political Science."
4,Steelers rule.,"A comfortable fit. Perfect for lounging around in, but a bit to baggy. I would have preferred this in black. Still a good T-Shirt though."
2,Primitive.,"Just in a word - primitive! A completely predictable story, with really mediocre acting.Amazon really needs to get some great Spanish movies - from Almodovar, etc."
1,Is Sociology a Science?,"Professor Fuller's tome gives new meaning to the term ""academic."" [Correction, these existing meanings will suffice: 4 Scholarly to the point of being unaware of the outside world. 7 Theoretical or speculative without a practical purpose or intention.] This critique of Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions (my copy of which is 212 pages) spans 423 pages, much of it densely packed footnotes. It also includes 37 pages of bibliographical references, of which entirely two are devoted to Fuller's own works (which, I'll wager, reek of the same ""research grant"" odour). But what purpose does this unprecedented documentation serve? Is there a thesis (idea) within this thesis (dissertation)? My advice: check out a copy from the library; it's the dusty one in the New Books section."
5,Lamination on top and bottom is nice addition,"The longer 1 1/2"" shackle makes this a more suitable padlock for situations where the shorter shackle isn't quite long enough. I'm using it for a thicker gauge chain and it is superior to the standard Master locks I typically use. Unfortunately, I learned the hard way that the laminated casing can crack and break if you drop the padlock onto a cement floor. A disadvantage to ordering this single unit is that if you need more than one, each has a different pair of keys. I use another set of three with the shorter shackles with interchangeable keys for storage rooms but prefer this model. Next time, I'll purchase a multiple package of the 1 1/2"" padlocks."
5,If you adore opera as I do you will treasure this and play it repeatedly,"What a lush and lovely collection, featuring one magical and exquisite presentation after another! As I said, if you adore opera then you will treasure these CDs. The 2 CD album states: Long drives, Lazy afternoons, Romantic dinners. My favorite however is to put it on when I lie down to sleep. Currently it resides in the CD player by my bed so that I can access it with ease. These scrumptious performances carry me to a lovely cloud and allow dreamy relaxation.. I recently acquired RAPTURE which I also heartily endorse."
2,Disappointed At UTPA,"International Books sent me a ""1979"" version of book ""Pricing"" by Monroe. The book I viewed and purchased via amazon did not look like the copy I received which was a hardcover green book 1979 edition. This should never happened and I expect a full refund from Amazon and/or International books."
1,A shaver that does not shave,"I never thought of myself as having a tough beard--but this shaver couldn't do anything with it--I had to go over my face dozens of times, and all the hair still wasn't gone. It was a terrible razor and I suggest to everyone to look elsewhere before spending your money on this piece of junk."
3,Not bad for the price,"I thought it shaved okay--not great, but passable if you press down and go over your face a couple of times. I was a little annoyed when I found out it needs an EIGHT HOUR CHARGE, but I was happy with the price."
5,Great,"It's really interesting, even if you arent a TLOTR fan ... its nice to see how he started drawing :)"
1,Disappointing,"I've liked Epson products. Not this one, though. I had great difficulty with the software under Windows XP. It would not install properly (so it told me) and the copy utility did not work properly. When I found what a hassle and expense it would be to deal with Epson support, I threw in the towel - sent it back to my on-line dealer and bought a Canon LIDE. I don't require brain surgery from my scanner, but it needs to do the basics without problems, and the Epson 1260 didn't."
1,Piece of junk...,"Really slow, low quality, crappy software and no power switch. And good luck getting technical support! My emails got bounced and I could not get through on the phone. Oh, and Epson offers you a ""free"" web space to post your photos... I read the fine print and it says that you lose your rights to pictures you post! Epson can claim your photos as its own and use them without even acknowledging you, let alone compensating you. So here's the summary: bad product, bad service, and they try to take your photos for themselves!"
3,So in Love With Two,"Seeing Mikaila in concert at the 2000 B96 Halloween Bash and recognizing her strong and soulful Christina Aguilera like voice, I was prompted to pay more attention to this young singer who was around 14 or 15 when she first arrived on the major music scene. Mikaila goes down the R&B road on most of the songs which helps the CD to stay grounded b/c as is known bubblegum pop is played out and even when it wasn't 2 much of it messed a CD up. So there are some songs that standout like the hip-hoppish and danceable PLAYGROUND which is worth buying the CD in itself. TALKIN ABOUT ME is also a good song. If you're lookin for a kick[ing] ... ballad take your [self] to FOREVER, FOR ALWAYS. On these songs and others, Mikaila seriously does tear it up."
4,Young Talent,"Ok the fact this girl is only 14 is reason enough to impress me..but the fact she can both sing and put out an amazing CD filled with great songs just blows me away. Her hit So In Love With Two got tons or airplay around the country, if you haven't heard it you definetely need to give it a listen. This CD is filled with amazing songs that just sounds a little deeper than anything by your typical pop princess...try out My Dream Is Gone or Playground to listen to some great songs and hear this girl who at a young age will soon take the world by storm :)"
4,Mikaila,Too bad that Mikaila's music does not have the great skills of Christina Aguilera or Britney Spears.But Mikaila has a GREAT voice!!Some songs are just not the right groove for her voice.But this album is pretty good.
5,back off 'official' reviewer,"ok, i'm not claiming to like this cd, i've never even heard it, but i got it on a list of suggestions because of other picks i have, and i must say i was appalled by that official reveiwers unfavorable reveiw. i think it very poor form to speak so arrogantly about a cd in it's own reveiw, this makes me mad, if this person didn't love the cd, fine, he doesn't have to, but he should bring out the points he thinks other people of certain tastes may enjoy, not put it down because it wasn't his style. i am personaly shocked that any person would write such a negative reveiw because it wasnt his cup of tea, no, i'm not some crazy peace out, life should be fair person, but i DO think this was uncalled for, and even though i don't intend to make a dramatic impression on these people, i do hope that reveiwers will improve there tactics for the sake of the music fans"
3,"Catchy songs, but...","The lyrics are completely boring. So In Love With Two is quite good, and she's got a rather good voice but not very memorable. The songs are rather junior high-ish and rathe like Hilary Duff, though I prefer Mikaila's voice to Duff's sugar coated one. The only tracks worth listening to are So In Love With Two, It's All Up to You, and perhaps My Heart Cant Let You Go.If anyone want deep and soulful lyrics and catchy beat AND beautiful voice, they should try Dido."
4,love her she can sing,this girl can win any battel on long notes she is a ture girl that does not lip sing she is very good at singing a song but some of the songs get on my nervs just like number 12 i hate that song but she can still sing really will i like her alot
5,Terrific,"Mikaila is excellent! This cd is filled with upbeat and groovy dance tunes. Her voice is pretty, cute and sweet. My favorites are So In Love With Two, Straight To My Face, and Emotional. Her slow songs are beautiful. I'd definitely recommend this cd. It's a lot of fun to dance and listen to."
3,Shows promise,"Mikaila released her debut album MIKAILA in early 2001 and it received little to no attention. It's no surprise since she didn't even promote this album. It makes you wonder who's managing her `cause with a little support this could've been a hit. The material on MIKAILA is mostly middle of the road pop songs that often sound flat. It's the same pop infused r&b but it sounds watered down at times. The only thing that often saves this Cd is Mikaila's voice. She sounds a bit like Christina Aguilera. Mikaila's voice is strong and it's able to carry out the emotion of the tune. Unfortunately there's not much behind the songs. The only songs that stand out are ""so in love with two"", ""emotional"" and ""because of you"". The rest struggles but Mikaila shows a lot of promise. With better management she could be on her way to the top."
1,Will it ever end????,"Ever since Britney Spears came out, the little teen pop ""singerelles"" have followed like a herd.Girls who have somewhat better ""voices"",but provide music which is much worse.This cd is no different.Everything is overproduced, and sounds just like all the cheap pop out there.And so what if Mikaila is only 13 and she already recorded a cd?It doesn't mean that she can sing.I mean if this is what qualifies for good singing,then I'll (I'm 13) go out and record an album, and start reading all the reviews on amazon about how mature my voice is.comparing it to some of the other junk out there , she is not the worst,but she does enough to fit right inp.s. I DID not buy this cd,I listened to it online."
4,Don't Give Up So Easily,"Don't give up so easily. After reading Mr. Wright review, I must say that it was kind of harsh. Mikaila has a beautiful voice, but yes it may sound like Brittney Spears with a little of Janet Jackson soul blues. What you have to remember is that everybody has to start somewhere. Ever star has an idle that they wish to portray in some way. Not everyone can be a poineer to the pop industry. I think that Mikaila not only has a beautiful name and face but also a voice that if given the write promotion she will take off. Don't be so easy to dismiss the young and talented star. Struggle is the name of the game. Everything in life is not that easy, as she was so easily dismissed in your review. Mikaila if you ever read this article don't give up hope. You do have fans out there. NEED MORE PROMOTION THOUGH"
2,Too technical.,"Yes, this was written by excellent researchers. But I prefer to read books on improving health that at some point give me the how tos. This was technical and too much to plow through. The same information can be found in more up to date writing ...books on improving health by eating more protein and less carbohydrate, for instance. Save your money and time."
5,Excellent book. A web of intrigues and history.,"This is one of the seemingly few fantasy books these days that had some depth to it. The interweaving plot lines and intrigues provide entertainment while showing the how imperfect the elves seemed to be, and how it leads to their fall. The author use of switching through time frames showed how and what events shaped their history, which in many ways is a mirror of our own. It renewed my interest in real history."
4,spectacular for veteran readers. . .,"I found this book very rewarding for a number of reasons: mostly because if you come across a set of characters you do not like, a few chapters later you will be reading about their grand-children. Still, it was well written and it did what I believe the author set-out to do: display a history of elves to show their differences (and similarities the elves wish they did not have) to humans in a cohensive story. My only complaint would have to be the simplicity of the ending. Save that I would dare to say this book is perfect."
5,"Very good, but sometimes confusing..","Evermeet: Island of Elves was a very good book about the history of elves and their struggle to keep their rich culture and magic alive. It was sometimes confusing, with the author on land then would suddenly skip to another land. But it all forms together towards the middle and end. It is a very good book, don't hesitate to buy it right now!"
4,a fast paced and wonderful read,"After Reading through Daughter of the Drow I dove head first into this book to find out more to boost my knowledge of the Realms Elves and their deep history.I must admit there where times when the story jumped and I found myself flitting back through pages to work out what was happening (though I am pretty new to the Realms books so maybe that's just me)But just like Elaine's other book I mentioned I found myself thrown into the story and after a short while found myself enjoying the who's related to whom and how side of the book.The story itself is wonderful if you can keep up with its speed. The characters are a bit of a mixed bag but most are well very written and wish there was more story written of them.If you were interested in looking into the history of the elves of the Forgotten Realms, I'd say you need not look anywhere else."
2,A bit confusing...,"This book would be great, but for one thing. Elaine Cunningham jumps around character too much. One moment I'm reading about the gods before Faerun, then she jumps a few centuries inthe future with completely different characters. I didn't know where I was!"
3,Interesting,"I think this book would have meant a lot more to me if I had read others in the group first. This was the first one I read and I didn't really get it. I got the ""plot"" but I didn't really see the point. I did, however, enjoy the book once I started to understand it and think that if you read the other ones it would be pretty good. You don't really get to meet the characters and it jumps around a lot. You do get to see how everything comes together in the history and how things happened. It's a well writien book and I'd recomend it to anyone who's interested in elven history."
2,I would expect more from Forgotten Realms,"Evermeet, Island of the elves, is a very confusing book. It has several plots and scenerios unfolding all at once, making it difficult for a reader to follow along with Cunningham.I personally think this book should have been released as a book of elven short stories, as that is what it reads like. I certainly would expect more from Forgotten Realms, in general."
2,Is she out of good ideas?,"Im a little concerned, both this book and R.A. Salvatore's new book are lacking. I don't know if they are suffering from burn-out or what, but their writing is suffering. Don't get your hopes up for a Lieriel Baenre or Danillo Thann like character, because they are not there. Very grim for a book about the ""frivilous"" elves."
4,Evermeet,Jumps around a bit but a good solid read.Could have used a few more stories about the gods sceeming.So read it.
4,As described,"Expensive filter and I would not have bought it if I were not in a spending spree mode. Find one cheaper at the auto parts store. Despite the claims, I have no idea how the average consumer can find a difference between a $10 filter and a $3 filter. Save your money."
1,Do not buy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Do not buy... Do not buy... Do not buy... Do not buy... Do not buy... Do not buy...The first 2 times the ice was ok. The third time the ice smelled bad and made the drink smell bad..... I tried to clean them up using soap and water but they still smelled bad. Then I ran them in the dishwasher and that did not help.Do not buy... Do not buy... Do not buy... Do not buy... Do not buy... Do not buy...
1,Perfect cubes? I think not.,"We were excited for this ice cube tray because we've had several plastic trays break recently, however when we got this tray and tried it out we were very disappointed with it. The cubes are far from perfect cubes, and we have to pry each one out. It is nice that they don't all fall out but it would be nicer if they came out without a struggle for each single one."
3,"Difficult to take ice out, spills easy.",Plus for being silicone and small enough to place in tiny freezer. Minus for not having an outer lip to prevent spilling over the side when moving or filling. Minus for being crazy difficult to get out; best technique is to bend completely in half so everything pops out of the front.
5,the best trays I have ever used,These trays are great. I love the fact that I can pop put 1 cube at a time!! My hands don't get frostbite while removing the cubes. I've bought them for all of my family. They love them because the trays pack a ton of ice into a small space. A great size for small refrigerators
1,difficult to remove ice cubes,The trays are small and made of very cheap plastic.Can not bend them so ice cimes out easily.Using hot water on baottom means cubes are half melted as they come out.
1,Bad Cubes,"Terrible product. You practically have to gnaw the cubes out of the sticky rubber. They certainly don't pop out. And although the ice doesn't taste like rubber, we can imagine the carcinogenic rubber sticking to your stomach liner. We can't believe Amazon sells this useless product."
1,Practical Joke Ice Trays,"Unless you're looking for a joke to play on a hostess at a party, don't order these ice (ha-ha) trays. Get something else. These are the absolute worst."
3,"Nice cubes, tough to empty","I love the idea of having perfectly square ice cubes. I also love that they are large. What I don't love is fighting with the silicon trying to get those square cubes out of the tray. Sure, you could just run some water over them to shrink the size, but not if you're going to put them in an ice tray with smaller cubes that will all stick together when the water drips off of them.Not bad but not great. Much too difficult to use... unless I just don't know the secret to getting them out. Traditional ice cube trays are much better if you just want a cold drink."
1,Awful PRoduct,I would return for a refund if the cost of return shipping was not almost the cost of the whole product. These Ice Cube Trays are not your standard size rather about half the normal size. I bought them thinking that silicone would make it very easy to remove the cubes. Well was that thought ever so wrong. Due to the depth of the cubes in the tray it is more difficult to remove the cubes than with a normal plastic ice cube tray. I would not recommend these to anyone.
4,Works well,I loved the these trays. They are easy to use. The food slides right out. Easy to wash and store.
3,Same chemical smell issue,"Yep, the chemical taste is definitely present after a couple of months of use. Very strange. Still using them, because I love the shape and size of the cubes, but reason says we should stop using them."
1,Nice idea but doesn't work,"These ice cube trays make a really nice sized I e cube, but I have extreme difficulty getting the ice cubes out of the trays. The third time I used them one of my fingers actually started to bleed. Now the company says that mineral build up will cause the cubes to stick...ok ...but the stuck like they were glued in the first time I used them. This time however I didn't fill the trays to the top, and when the water froze it expanded and made a ridge around the top of each cube...ok...my error. The second time I used them I filled them to the brim, the ice cubes still stuck ,Ike they were glued in....washed the trays more carefully and tried a third time, filling the trays to the brim, and the cubes still stuck, making my finger tip very cold and sore. I have stopped using these trays, the silicon in these trays does not appear to be a good grade of silicon, silicon is normally slippery, these trays are not s,I papery."
5,"Tovolo Perfect Cube Ice Tray, Set of 2, Dark Blue","Very easy to use. Twists much easier than traditional ice trays. And when the ice doesn't pop out right away, all you need to do is flex the bottom with a small push from your thumbs and it's out."
1,Big Mistake!,"This is my first Amazon review. I'm passionate about these trays so here goes - They looked darling and with the promise of space saving I impulsively bought 3 sets. Well, they do save space and they are cuter in real life than in the picture. But there is no easy way to remove the ice cubes!! NONE. I'm typing this with fingers that feel like they have freezer burns. They are useless as ice cube trays. I'm trying to figure out what I can recycle them into . . ."
3,Holds odor of food,"I bought these to freeze portions of my son's baby food and cubes of pesto. I love the shape of the cubes and how easy they are to pop out, but hate that the material holds onto the smell of garlic or other pungent smells. I tried soaking them in white vinegar and freezing water, etc to remove the odors, but nothing works."
1,POOR PICTURE,This picture leads you to believe the tray is the size of a normal tray.Maybe even a little wider since it is three rows instead of just two.I ordered 8 of these thinking I would be getting enough ice for a cooler.The trays are like the size of my hand. The cubes are so tiny. 120 cubesdoes not even equal one $1.50 bag of ice. And I spent over $35.00 on these.VERY UNHAPPY
4,"Owned for 4+ years, no issue with taste","I bought a set of these back around '07 and am still using them. I've never had an issue with ""plastic"" flavor that other are commenting about. I've also always hand-washed mine though (not for any special reason, I just don't happen to have a dishwasher...) and I've never used them with anything other than water in them so that could possibly be part of the difference.Why they're a 4 instead of a 5? Mine got warped at some point during manufacture or shipping and have NEVER been straight. I've tried re-blocking the warped compartments with cubes from the non-warped compartments, but no dice. It doesn't really affect anything other than that some of my cubes are wonky rather than being perfect cubes though.I'd buy another one of these though, they stack well in a small space and I prefer silicon ice cube trays in general for ease of removing the cubes (I tend to be one of those people who ""twists"" ice cube trays which is a big no-no with rigid ones!)"
5,Excellent for Homemade Baby Food,"I started making all of my babies food at home and ordered these to freeze the purees in. They work great! There are no ridges so I can just pour the puree all over the top, and then use a spatula to clean off excess. So easy! It makes perfect little cubes that defrost easily when I need them.Also, popping out is a snap. I just bend the tray and they all pop up a little bit- and you can just push it out from the bottom. No frozen together cubes, no half cubes left in the tray, no splintering. I ordered two, and am getting two more!"
2,Stylish but totally impractical-,"These trays produce neat, stylish, square cubes- but getting said cubes loose from the tray required a ridiculous amount of effort.Because the silicone trays are flexible, the cubes don't pop loose when the tray is twisted. The walls close back after a twist onto the cubes. You then have to push, poke & otherwise wrest each cub loose from the tray.If you have arthritis, etc. forget these trays unless you want to suffer for every cube."
4,Great Find!!,"I was really tired of my plastic ice trays breaking all of the time so I decided to try these. I am sure glad that I did. The color makes me smile every time I open the freezer, and they are easy to wash up. These make real cubes not the oblong things out of the regulars. They do take longer to melt in your glass which is nice. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is the time needed to relearn how to get the cubes out. You want to push on the bottom of each space to get them out. May not be easy for anyone with arthritis or any problems moving thier fingers of wrists. These trays also take up less space but don't make quite as much, so I suggest starting with four. Enjoy!!"
2,way too small,WAY smaller than it looks online. Wish I would have gotten something else. Looks like I'll be returning. Not fun.
1,silicone taste in ice cubes,"I'm pretty sure for the first couple of weeks the ice cubes it made were tasteless - but now, everything that comes out of them tastes chemically - I'm going back to hard plastic trays."
1,"Hard to Extract Cubes, Smells, and Rips","The good stuff first:+ The shape of the ice cubes is fantastic. They're square, big and don't melt very quickly so my drinks stay cold and don't get watered down very quickly.The bad stuff:- There's no lip on the trays so it's tough to fill them and move them to the freezer without spilling- The cubes are really tough to get out of the tray. It's really more of a mold so they need to be squeezed and pushed out. Takes a few minutes.- After just a few uses one of my trays ripped in the corner while trying to get the cubes out- Although my ice cubes don't seem to smell (I'm not 100% sure though) the trays themselves have a distinctive and unpleasant odour"
1,"Great at first, then bad flavor","These ice trays were great at first, but after about 2 months they started leaving a bad taste in the ice cubes. I tried freezing baking soda water, running them through the dishwasher, and nothing has worked. I had to toss them."
2,Film in water,"I like the overall concept of the trays, however, the cubes leave filmy floaters in my beverage and on my glass. Gross! Too bad I can't return them."
4,Nice Baby Food Cubes,"These trays work well for freezing cubes of baby food. They hold 2 tablespoons of pureed food. I would not recommend leaving them in the tray and using one cube at a time. Rather I pop them all out and store them in a plastic freezer bag. I cover the tray with plastic wrap while it freezes, but I wish they had snap-on lids. That would make it a 5 star item."
1,Chinese silcone broke down.,"The Tovolo ice cube trays seemed great at first. I liked the shape of the ice cubes. But after about three months the trays developed a sickeningly harsh chemical smell which was imparted to the ice cubes. Apparently, the Chinese silcone material is not stable over time. I reluctantly discarded the trays as they made the ice cubes unfit for consumption."
1,This product should be un-invented,"We had some old trays and when I saw the flexible silicon, naturally I thought this is it. The old trays were tapered and difficult. These are square and do not release the ice cubes. Water expands when frozen and makes it nearly impossible to remove a group of ice cubes. Its a one by one fight.After two trays its like frost bite fingers. If it wasn't for job of repacking, the drive to the post office and the cost of shipping these would have been returned the first day. I would not store nuts and bolts in my shop in these.Richard, not Marlene."
3,Meh.,"It freezes well and it washes great in the dishwasher. Its kind of tough to get the cubes out of there once frozen! I use for making baby food and given the chance, I wouldn't buy this again."
2,Messy to use,"I bought a pair of these at Whole Paycheck Market. I'm disappointed. Remember, they make potholders out of silicone. It's a good insulator. My big beef is filling them and putting the full tray in the freezer. What a mess! You also have to work for your ice-cube to get it out. Lastly, they are not perfect. One cube pushes toward its neighbor, so they end up being sorta, kinda perfect. Were the tray hard and inflexible, perfection would be closer. Keep searching."
1,Just awfull,"The cubes are very difficult to remove as others have stated, the taste though is disgusting. Mine tasted bad after about a week. All our drinks taste like soap.I also found the water took twice the time to freeze in these compared to my standard trays."
1,Good Idea Bad Execution,"i bought these because i needed new ice trays, but was sadly disappointed the ice had a horrible taste and where hard to get out of the tray i wouldn't never buy again"
1,Great at first... Terrible plastic flavor,"These ice cubes were really great for about 3 months. Then they started emitting a terribly toxic, plastic smell that couldn't be washed off and permeated the ice cubes. I'm very disappointed."
4,For those having trouble with the residue and floaters...,"1) This is a good product and gives you a nice emulation of Kold-Draft ice cubes as far as size and shape.2) The residue issue - white or cloudy/tranparent floaters coming off of the cubes, most simply tested by dropping newly frozen Tovolo cubes into a glass of water - is real and grossed me out to the point that I stopped using these temporarily. My theory is that this phenomenon is related to some finishing agent on the silicone.In any case, this what worked for me: I placed my two trays in the sink and filled the trays with white vinegar and let them sit overnight. I then dumped them, wiped everything out with a sponge, rinsed them out with hot water and tried a new batch of ice. No floaters, and I am back to using these happily."
1,The WORST,"This is, literally, the worst thing I have ever spent money on! Impossible to get the ice out without freezing your hands - and touching every ice cube! RIDICULOUS!"
1,Smelly,The ice is hard to remove and the silicone absorbs odors. I had to throw mine out it smelled so bad--as bad as freezer-burned ice-cream tastes.
2,Can I sell you some icetrays??,"Perfect cubes....if you can get them out. My husband pushes them out with his thumb, but some of us ladies havelong thumbnails. Takes both hands to put refilled trays back in the freezer due to balancing act of its flexability.They are definitely not worth the price."
3,Still looking for a good ice cube tray.,These are not the worst ice cube trays but they are not very easy to use. Like the idea of silicone but it is difficult to get the ice cubes out of the tray and it is easy to spill the water when transporting to freezer.
3,removal of ice,Ice is difficult to pop out. You really need to push on the back to get the ice to release. Not as ideal as I would have thought.
5,Cocktail essentials.,Worked like a charm. They make perfectly sized cocktail ice cubes. I highly recommend.
3,Disgusting chemical taste,"I love the idea behind this product - the shape is incredible, and it makes great cubes. The problem is that it tastes disgustingly of plastic chemicals. We've washed and washed and washed. We've done the vinegar wash. We've even done the dishwasher (which they don't recommend) to try and remove this taste.But it won't go away. They come out of the wash smelling normally, but once they have ice in them it begins. The longer they sit in the freezer the harsher and more pronounced the chemicals become. At this point, I have no option except to throw them away, as much as I don't want to.The only thing I can think is that these were simply not made using food-grade silicone."
2,not easy to use,"The silicon material makes it very durable, but it's not easy to get the cubes out of the tray because they're perfectly square with no space between the cube compartments instead of tapered like traditional ice cube trays. If the silicon were molded into the shape of a traditional ice cube tray so you could squeeze the cubes out, that would make it more functional."
2,Unpleasant flavor,"I am also experiencing the same issue with these trays imparting an unpleasant, metallic/rubbery flavor to my ice cubes. At first, I thought they needed to be cleaned again, so I put them through the dishwasher. No change. Washed them by hand. No change. Finally, I thought that perhaps I had been leaving the cubes in the trays too long in the freezer--that maybe this was giving the flavor time to ""seep into"" the cubes. So I made a batch and took them out as soon as they were solid. Still a noticeable off-flavor in my drinks. The cubes I make in my old plastic trays taste fine... guess I'll go back to using those."
5,Perfectly Square Cubes!,"I ordered these after I was served a glass of water at my salon with perfectly square cubes, which with me, little details like that really catch my eyeball. If you like that perfectly square cube, these trays are for you and you will not be disappointed. However, until you use them a few times, the cubes are difficult to release, but with use, it becomes easier. But they do take at least two days to freeze absolutely firm. If you want to make a lot of ice at one time, these won't fit the bill. I still use my old plastic ones for that because not only do your fingers freeze trying to get the cubes out, it's a bit of a daunting task and like I said ... it takes a couple of days for the cubes to freeze solidly. I give them a 5 star rating because I wanted perfectly square cubes and these do that. I was actually a little amazed that I paid something like 13 clams for ice cube trays, but .... you get your money's worth if you want perfection."
5,"Great for ""Adult"" Beverages","This is a really good silicone ice-cube tray. It is not so flimsy that you spill water everwhere trying to get the tray into the freezer, but it is flexible enough that getting individual ice cubes out is not a problem. My husband loves these perfectly sqaure ice cubes in his scotch because they do not melt as fast as normal ice cubes. The only thing that I would note is that these trays are a little harder to fill than normal ice trays because there is no channel for the excess water to flow from one cube area to another. Overall, a great product."
1,Buyer beware,Makes great ice but your can't take the ice cubes out and you can't fill it up easily. Terrible design.
5,Cool! Literally,"As some others have said, you do have to take the cubes out one at a time. Overall, though, it's exactly what I expected from it. You don't have to be a weightlifter to get the cubes out like normal trays, just push out the cubes you want and refill!"
2,"Nice idea, but...","I liked the look of these online, but using them... has some problems. Water will easily spill/splash when you fill these and when you freeze them and want to remove the ice cubes it is really tough. It takes a lot of work to get the cubes out of the tray."
2,"Decent product, but comes coated in unwashable powder","I've liked these ice trays in the past, so when after years of use my old one started to tear at the corner I ordered more. These came in some sort of creepy anti-mold powder. Not super thick, but after many, many washes it's still there. Product looks clean, but the powder gets into the ice cubes and into drinks. Insidious stuff. Unless they can send it without this, I'd avoid."
1,bad smell / taste,"These trays worked well for a month or two, and then started making my ice cubes taste awful.At first I thought it was something in my freezer, but after making ice with traditional trays, it's definitely the silicone trays. I can't tell if it's a freezer burn smell, or a chemical smell like some others have described, but whatever it is, it's BAD! It will make everything you put the ice into taste yucky.Not worth the money"
2,Tough to remove cubes,I was hoping that these cube trays were the perfect thing but unfortunatly it takes much too much time to remove the cubes. Once removed they're fine but I stopped using them due the the difficulty in removing the cubes
1,Terrible flavour and smell,"It took a while to figure out that it wasn't something in the freezer causing my drinks to taste bad. It was the new ice trays. Truly, every drink with this ice tastes terrible. I've ruined some very good bourbon as a result. They're going back."
2,"nice shape, hard to get ice out","I got these to freeze squares of home made baby food and pesto. I like how the cubes can be removed and stored neatly in baggies or other containers. However, it takes FOREVER to get the ice out, and usually I give up because my hands get too cold. Also, they are really wobbley, so you need to take extra care when putting them into your freezer. A rectangular sushi plate works well for that. If you have serious limited freezer space, this might make sense, but for making ice for every day use, stick with the plastic ones that you can just twist to release the ice."
4,Each Color is a different size,Read the descriptions carefully. The pink ones make the biggest cubes according to my current descriptions. They different colors come in slightly different sizes. This mattered to me because I am looking for the biggest shakeable ice cubes for home bartending and cocktails.
1,unhappy,"Very, very disappointed in the quality of the trays. Too flimsy, too difficult to remove cubes from particularly for someone with arthritis in the hands. Would not buy this product again. Far from ""perfect"" as advertised."
3,Makes nice cubes,"You'll need both hands to fill it for freezing because it's so pliable. The cubes are difficult to remove -- need to be extracted one by one. Best to fill to the top with water, otherwise the cubes are too small to remove. After a few weeks, I seem to be getting the hang of it, but it isn't easy to empty. The cubes, though, are PERFECT CUBES and look nice in a tall drink."
2,Too Hard,Not easy to get ice out of tray. Too much of a struggle. It does not matter if it is full or low with water.
4,Pretty good ice trays,I got these ice trays to use when the ice maker went out of my refriderater. The trays worked very well but I had a hard time gtting the cubes to fall out. Still a very good product though.
5,"Difficult at first, but now they work","At first I was very frustrated with these because as people mentioned, the ice is hard to get out, but i have found that now since i've had them for a little while, they have become worn in and the ice comes our very easily. Now it is everything that I hoped. Nice large ice cubes that are easily removed."
4,great for cocktails,"At $10 for really nice-looking ice, you can't go wrong. Getting the ice out does take some getting used to so I suggest dumping all the ice into an ice bucket."
4,"Make great square cubes, but tray is a little flimsy","These work perfectly as advertised, and they make great perfect cubes. They can be tricky to fill, though. My freezer is all drawers (annoying, and not Tovolo's fault), but the flimsy trays make it easy to drip and spill while putting them in the freezer. This was a problem at first, but I've become accustomed to is, and love using this product."
1,Terrible plastic/ammonia taste seeps into ice after 1 month of use,"The trays made nicely sized cubes, and they were not too difficult to get out.However, after 1 month of intensive use (with filtered water), the trays started imparting strong plastic taste/aftertaste to the ice. The taste was very powerful, to the extent of making taste of, say, Coca Cola completely unrecognizable. There is also a perceptible hint of ammonia in the smell of ice.Whatever it is these trays are leaking, it can't be good for your health. We're throwing these away and not recommending ANYONE to use them."
1,Beautiful cubes that taste and smell awful,"I wanted to like these. It makes such beautiful cubes. At first, my cubes had no odor or taste problem but after 2 months of ownership there is an odor and bad taste. I put some in a drink and had pour out my drink. The cubes smelled (like freezer frost) and they tasted horrible."
2,funny residue,"Like some other reviews,the tray is wabbly to fill up.But my main problem is the residue.Something is strange with these trays.Do this test...take your regular ice from your original trays and use that ice in water(clear glass),then do the same with these silicone tray ice cubes.(allow the cubes to melt and carefully examine the water in both glasses).what is all the stuff floating around in the water from the silicone tray's cubes?AND YES I WASHED THE TRAYS CAREFULLY BEFORE USE.WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY."
4,Pretty cool ice cube tray :),"When I first read the description I thought it a bit over the top. They're ice cubes, after all. How amazing can they be?Well... the answer, apparently, is pretty amazing. The only knock I have on the finished product is that for a narrow glass you'll only get one stack - no side by side action. Otherwise - no complaints. Easy to empty the tray, nothing sticks, there's no channels that end up making one big mega-cube, and you don't spend 20 minutes twisting and bending and fearing you'll break your tray. They're big enough you can drop mint leaves or bits of fruit in and make some fancy drinks - a hit if you're hosting a party. They stack well - no sticking to one another in the freezer. They're dishwasher safe. What's not to love?"
4,If the thought of perfect ice cubes makes you smile...,"I admit it: I had never really thought about the shape of an ice cube (is there anything more utilitarian than an ice cube?)but this tray makes any cold beverage just look more appealing. Price point is also good considering this is BPA-free and a lovely green color. Some have made comments about the difficulty of dislodging the cubes but, in my opinion, there are worse things than 1-3 seconds of momentary inconvenience if it means no more cracked, chemical-laden trays or remnant ""ice-splinters"" sliding along the kitchen floor and best of all, if I want three ice cubes I can get just three--instead of five, seven or the whole dozen (half of which inevitably end up in the sink). Not disappointed in the least."
5,Excellent Choice,"I ordered these to use to freeze breastmilk and homemade babyfood. They have exceeded my expectations!The first feature I enjoy is knowing the exact weight (1oz) of each cube. This takes the guess work out of figuring out how much I'm feeding my baby.I love the flexibility of these too. Once filled and frozen, it makes emptying the trays much easier. I also like that the silicone does not hold scents. When I need to use these trays to freeze babyfood, I know that the peas will not absorb the taste of the squash we froze previously.Another feature to note:I do not know if it was intended by the manufacture or a lucky conincidence, but the dimensions of the tray are conducive to not having to rearrange the freezer. It's a bit smaller than your average bag of frozen veggies, or containers I usually use to freeze leftovers. No trying to balance a long and skinny tray over multiple uneven items.These have been invaluable as I continue to try my hand at homemade babyfood!"
1,"Silicone ice cube trays, pack of 2, red","I bought these and returned them.They make nice size, shape cubes, however they have a weird film on them. Not sure if it's greasy or wax, just weird and it makes a film on the top of your drinks you can see.I washed in sink by hand and ran through dishwasher, still filmy. Just weird."
1,Form over function,"I am so tired of my wife complaining that she can't get the cubes out of these trays!We bought these because of the success we've had with other silicone products. They don't impart any taste into the cubes that I've noticed, but even I have a hard time getting the cubes out. We like to pop a whole tray of cubes out into an ice bin that we keep in the freezer, because we use a lot of ice. By the time I've gotten a whole tray ejected, my fingers are usually frozen and stiff! Then I want to go on to the second tray, and it's no fun.If you want perfect cubes, though, this is probably the closest you'll get."
3,ice cube trays,the ice cube trays are fun but because they're flexible it's difficult to get them into the freezer without spilling the water. they're also hard to stack in the freezer before they're frozen.
3,annoying to get the cubes out,"now that i've tried this silicone tray for a few weeks, i wish i had the old plastic hard one it replaced. with the old-fashioned kind, the cubes were shot out in a second. just as other disappointed reviewers say, with this kind, one must push each cube out one at a time. not worth the effort."
5,No more slamming and breaking!,"I have not owned a silicon ice cube tray before, but I was tired of having to slam plastic trays and breaking them. These trays, on the other hand, are excellent. The tray bottom is firm, ensuring that the tray will not flop around, but it is flexible enough to get ice cubes out pretty easily (except for the corner ones). The colour is also pretty nice, and most importantly, the price is right."
5,Does what it claims.,"While it is true that pushing the cubes out can be a bit of a pain, the fact that you get real ice ""cubes"" is worth the effort. Really though, it's not that bad. You just have to push each cube out. It's no big deal. Any type of tray that easily releases the cubes, is going to have a rounded or angled shape. It's pure physics. If you want cube-shaped cubes, they are going to be more difficult to release.Also, keep in mind that these are soft, so your best bet is to place them on a cookie sheet or other moveable flat surface before filling. That way, they will be easy to transport to the freezer without spilling.The size of the cubes is perfect. They are very large so they melt slower, but they are not too large to fit in any glass. In my opinion, these are the best ice cube trays around. Plus, I like my ice cubes to be cubes...no rounded edges and no chipping from sliding release devices.In simple terms; these things rock!"
2,Stinky cube maker,"My biggest objection is that our less than two year old trays smell terrible. They have absorbed odors from everything that was ever stored in the refrigerator/freezer and no amount of washing removes the smell. We've never put anything in them except filtered water. The ice cubes have no discernible taste yet, but yuck!"
2,Hard to get the cubes out,"I bought those to make baby food, and don't like them. It's near impossible to get the cubes of food out (only tried bananas and carrots). I'll stick to the regular boring plastic trays that work. Oxo make a great tray with a sliding top that keeps odors out of the baby food."
1,Poor ice cube trays,"There was a STRONG flavor in the ice cubes, To me it tasted of rubber. Either way it was totally unexceptable . Thanks for asking and thanks for the refund.P.S. we found the trays made by RUBBER MADE to be totally flavorless andyou should look at selling them not the ones you do.Thank You Gary Gardner"
1,"Finally, an ice cube tray for masochists","My girlfriend and I got these because they seemed like a great way to make cold beverages more exciting.Pros: actual ice cubesCons: rigorous extraction processYou will likely find the pro will only ever outweigh the con if you are hosting a cocktail party, want to impress your math geek friends, or are simply feeling a bit masochistic.While certainly pretty, these cubes can make what should be a simple task like putting a few ice cubes in a glass a painful 2-3 minute affair. You have to push and pull strenuously just to release one cube. Want more than one? Get ready for PAIN as your hands begin to frost over. In our house this is often followed by swearing on my part and a refusal to ever use these stupid trays again. Not even slamming them on the counter can speed up the process (oh, how I tried).To summarize, only get these if they won't be your primary source of ice cubes, or you like your vodka tonics with a twist of needless frustration."
3,"It's OK, works well...","Bought these to replace old plastic ice cubes trays. They work well, I just wish that the ice cubes released a little easier."
3,This size melts slower BUT not so easy to get out of tray?,"The title pretty much says it all.The cubes this tray produces are thicker in three dimensions that typical tray cubes so they last longer in liquid. However a typical tray drops it's cubes with a simple twist.This one even with the silicon wants a push on every cube from the bottom after a rinse in cool water to loosen a bit. At first I wondered if it was even practical to get them out it was so tough. Now I figured out that you have to push on each cube bottom hard and deep and twist. A little on the slow side but the larger cubes are worth the effort (maybe?).Smaller size, these trays are about half as long as regular trays, makes it easier to find a place in the freezer but you get less cubes per tray. All for the large size? Perhaps I would not buy if I knew then what I know now."
1,What a hassle,"I bought these because I like the shape of cube they make and they are cool looking. Unfortunately, they are not worth the trouble. Getting a cube out is a total pain in the neck. You can't stack them until they are frozen or the cubes freeze funny and they are even MORE difficult to get out. Also, when wrestling with the thing to get cubes out the silicone between the cubes has pulled apart. So now I can't fill up the outside cubes on two of my trays. I guess the only pro with these are the cube it makes. I like the old style, perfect cube that they make but they are a total headache."
4,They hold a lot of water,"Bought two sets of these trays; I'm going to buy two more sets. We drink lots of different ice teas via infuser and go through more ice than our freezer can manufacture. When we have company, we always have to buy a bag of ice.In our freezer, we have a small shelf that will hold eight of these trays. Two trays fill a two-quart container. The cubes are awesome: They are huge and last a long time. Still working on the removal technique, strong hands help. It is a little difficult to get the cubes out of the four corners, all the other cubes are easily removed. Regardless, we're buying 2 more sets because they complement our ice maker perfectly. They stack nice and seem durable. If they don't last, I'll update my posting."
2,Silicone Ice tray,"I thought these would be real easy to use but I was very wrong. OK, they're ice trays. But the simple fact is they are difficult to fill and trying to get the ice out is ridiculous. You have to remove each cube one at a time and they stick to the tray. They do make nice perfect cubes (which is why I gave them 2 stars) but they are more trouble then they are worth."
2,meh,These icecube trays are reasonably fine. But they develop the nasty freezer-burn smell faster than the firm plastic ones. We retired them pretty quickly.
3,Absorbs freezer smell/taste.,"I bought a set of the Perfect Cube trays in 2010. After about 6 months, I was put off by the amount of freezer smell they had absorbed. We tried running them through the dishwasher, soaking in vinegar, leaving them out in the sun ... nothing fixed it 100% (but the sun was best) and the smell would quickly return. After 2 years I am giving up and throwing them out.I never had any trouble getting the cubes out of the tray, as other reviewers have written. Just push on the soft backside of the tray and the cubes come right out. Not as quick as a hard plastic tray where you twist and the cubes fall out, but on the other hand, here you have more control if you just want 1 or 2 cubes at a time."
4,"Great, but...","This is a great product, but it does have one major flaw, in my opinion. It's great because it makes perfectly-shaped ice cubes. Further, they are easy to remove. On the downside, you can't fill the pockets and place the trays in the freezer without spilling water. Impossible. It would be better if the trays were in some sort of rigid structure/frame.I've only used a few ice cubes and I haven't noticed any strange taste, as others have."
4,Works well,"Cubes can be a bit difficult to pop out, but otherwise this is a great product. Makes perfect cubes of ice."
1,It make the ice taste like plastic,The ice trays worked well for the first few uses but then started to make the ice taste like plastic. I tried washing them but it did not help. The trays are now simply unusable. :(
1,"silicone, you let me down!","These trays look pretty cool, and silicone is a pretty neat material for kitchen products that were typically made of metal or hard plastic, but in this case they just don't work. A pair of ice cube trays should be able to be emptied in about 20 seconds, I figure. I struggled with these for 8 minutes. Good old plastic would RELEASE the cubes when twisted. With these trays, each square gives birth to a cube after much pushing and prodding. Too much hassle!I'm going back to the old uncool trays."
3,Too much work...,"I like the small size of the trays...with larger square cubes. However, it is really difficult to get the ice cubes out... you have to push each one out individually. Even though they tend to crack over time, I still prefer the trays that you can just twist to release the cubes."
2,Great concept. Weird film.,I loved the square shape of the ice. I liked that the plastic won't break when I try to get the ice out. My complaint is that they left a film on the ice that ended up in my drink. I've washed the ice trays multiple times and still get that film in my drink. Decided it probably isn't good for me. They make a great organizer for hair clips etc. for my daughter.
2,Disappointed,"In my impossible search for a tray that makes large, square ice cubes for using in liquor drinks (not as much dilution), I tried this tray. Ordered two. They are cute and made of good material. But the cubes are extremely difficult to extract. Extremely. Have to bend them and twist them and poke them, and, eventually, success. They are also very expensive for an ice cube tray."
4,The Perfect Ice Cube!,I love these trays! I recommend to anyone who likes whiskey on the rocks. The cubes are the perfect size for any rocks glass.
1,Too expensive to be useless! Smelly icecubes! Yuk!,"I am so disappointed in these. They worked fine for a few weeks ( I bought two trays ) and now they give off a horrible odor! And the ice tastes like rubber! I am so mad! I have bought Tovolo products in the past, but never again. I want my money back."
2,Frustrating!,"I purchased these trays to replace the Rubbermaid plastic trays that had given me 10 years of satisfaction. While the color and pliability of these trays are a plus, the ice cubes are very difficult to remove. The cubes are perfect squares, and very attractive in a cocktail or glass of iced tea, but I have to push each cube out of its compartment with my fingers, from the bottom of the tray. I expected that a couple of twists would loosen the cubes sufficiently to dump them into my bucket, but instead, I have to pry, push and coax each cube free. It's a pain, and I'm going back to Rubbermaid."
2,Strange film.,"When I use the ice cubes from this tray, there always seems to be a strange film in my water. It's like a film came off the ice cuber holder and went into the cubes, becuase it's like flakes in the water. I've tried cleaning it with everything, even in the dishwasher, but the film flakes still subsist. Is there anyway I can fix this? I love the tray save for this weird flaw."
3,Difficult cube ejection,"Just the shape I wanted but it is necessary to melt a bit under a hot faucet before the ice cubes will come out of the trays. Enough of a pain that they are only used when the presentation of the cocktail requires an oversized square ice cube. A disappointment,"
5,Perfect for Homemade Baby Food!,"If you make your own baby food, silicone is the way to go! I started making prune puree for my daughter and I bought both silicone trays and standard ""twist and pop"" trays to try out. I simply could NOT get the prunes out of the plastic tray, no matter how much I twisted, turned, grunted, and grumbled, but all I had to do with these was bend the tray and poke the back with one finger and out popped the cube. Like most ice cube trays, each opening is 1 oz exactly (I checked with a measuring cup and water), so you can portion the food precisely.I don't know about making ice in these, as I haven't tried it. You WILL need to have a flat surface in your freezer that can accommodate the tray, and you will want to cover with plastic wrap before you stack to avoid freezing one tray to the other, but those are simple requirements to meet."
1,Form over function,"These things look really slick and create very nice looking ice cubes. But as far as practicality goes - they're a total strikeout.- As the other poster said, there's no easy way to remove the ice cubes. As these trays are soft rubber, a flexible seal is created around each cube and flexing the tray doesn't eject them. You pretty much have to push each cube out through the back.- The top of the tray and cube walls are all the same height, this means filling all the pockets and loading the trays into the fridge without spilling is a challenge.- The trays are a non-slip surface, which means sliding them into the fridge also is annoying.Yes, these are all nit-picky points, but when it comes to something as simple and utilitarian as an ice cube tray, when someone gets it wrong, it's that much more noticeable."
1,Gross smell of trays,"I agree with the reviews about the trays giving off a bad odor and taste to the ice cubes. For a couple months the trays are flawless making perfect cubes. Then we noticed that our teas and drinks starting tasting like ""freezer"" - now we have cleaned the freezer and the ice cube trays smell horribly bad. I would be safe to bet that this is also not very good for you....maybe even toxic. Throwing them away and going back to plastic. Thanks for wasting my 12 dollars tovolo. Who let them make this bad product anyway?"
3,good but not perfect,good mats for taking a beating. My only complaint is the lockdowns that come with the mats. They do not work at all. They are to small and not strong enough to hold the mat in place. Other than that the mats are well made and will last a very very long time.
5,Simply The Most Uniquely Beautiful Work On This Subject!,"When I first stumbled onto this impressive book in the store, I could not put it down! John Cody's paintings are masterful. They are full of the most delicate brilliant colors and light. Page after page features the loveliest images of these wonderful creatures from around the World. Attention to detail is second to none, his accurate and perceptive portrayals demonstrate an intimate knowledge of these ethereal insects in a spectacular fashion.My brothers and I avidly collected these moths at night, in the rural North Carolina mountains. It was thrilling to see them dart around the street lamps like fiery jewels. Unfortunately, most books on this subject feature photos of pinned, faded samples. I've always felt it was a shame people couldn't experience their enchanting magic like we did. John Cody's book does that."
1,Hunk of Junk and bad support,"I have had this printer 14 months when it just stopped working. When I turn the machine on, all it does is blink lights. When I called HP support they said it would cost $55 to talk to a technician. They would do nothing at all to help unless I paid more money because the warranty was up (12 months). They did not tell me if the machine was fixable or not. I already paid $300 and do not want to pay any more for this hunk of junk. I will never buy another HP product. HP does not support their products."
4,A satisfied Customer,"Don't let the problematic XP reviews fool you. HP posted a new PSC2210 driver set for WindowsXP on their website on 2003-01-31. This printer is a great value. I wish it could accomodate all 3 cartridges at the same time to avoid swapping between text and photo; however, it is still a good bang for the buck.Just one complaint. The cost of the cartridges is high and they do not go very far. Be prepared and keep some extras on hand."
1,Think twice (maybe even three times) before you buy this!,I have spent the last hour trying to set up my parents' new 2210; it has already jammed seven times just trying to align the print cartridges! Don't waste your money on this thing; there must be a better printer out there.
2,High Expectations Unmet,"After much searching for an officejet to replace my old HPk45, I decided on the 2210. It was the right size, had the right features and the right price. However, after setting it up, I found that it would not scan when attached to my new Dell Dimension 4550 running XP. My first call to HP resulted in this advice: Dell has problems with their USB ports, and, get a powered USB hub. Dell denied a problem. My second call resulted in more honesty. The rep admitted that the printer has problems and that corporate has not addressed them because of their preoccupation with the Compaq merger. Only lately have they taken notice of the complaints. I asked the rep which Officejet he recommended, and he replied unequivocally, the D135. So I returned the 2210 and bought a D135. It cost more, but it has more versatility, is less costly on consumables, and it does scan!!!"
1,Unable to scan a single photo!,"With the latest firmware and the latest Hewlett Packard software, all what I get while trying to scan a photo is: ""the scanner could not be initialized"". That makes the all-in-one to crash by itself! The only way to recover from there is to turn the ""all-in-one"" off and on again. I tried to uninstall and reinstall, etc, etc. Going through the blogs doesn't help. Would some HP engineer please write a new firmware version for this almost-all-in-one?"
3,Beware of HP Customer support,I had this printer for about 10 months when it started having problems. It worked well before that. I called HP tech support and I got these people in Inda who had me try different things. They gave me a number to fax my information and case number to because the machine was still under warranty -- but then I got no response after that.
2,"Good printer, but does not last long","I purchased this printer almost a year to the day that it broke down. It did everything that I needed it to do, however, it jammed and no longer will initialize. Because of the cost of repairing out of warranty, I will probably purchase a different product rather than repair this one. I spent a week trying on my own to repair it,and then discovered my warranty had run out. Hewlett Packard has online help, which was not able to fix my problem either. My last printer was Hewlett Packard and I never had a problem with it. Because they are building everything with cheap plastic now, I am disappointed in my 2210xi printer. I used to brag to everyone about how wonderful my first printer was, and now I am bummed with this one."
1,Other reviews confirm a very high failure rate,"My own experience with the psc 2210 has been remarkably similar to the worst that other reviewers have described: repeated failures, comnpany refusal to stand by its products, poor technical support. What has struck me is how high a percentage of reviewers have given the 2210 one star out of five - and that seems grudging for many of them!Reliability is the most important consideration for me, and, in my experience, the 2210 is simply not reliable. Given the low expectations we have gotten used to for consumer electronics, that in itself is not shocking. What DOES disturb me is the ""We've got your money, so we're happy even if you're not"" attitude that seems to go all the way to the top of the HP customer service organization. As a result, HP, a company I used to admire, is off my list."
4,"Great Product, Poor Support","I couldn't find anything that explained where to get an additional driver (ME) for Windows XP print sharing. This is required when the host is running Windows XP and the remote PC is running Windows ME. The online email response I got didn't address XP and didn't tell me the file name of the driver or where to get it. With home networks becoming common, help loading printer drivers to support multiple computers seems like a pretty basic support task. A phone call to a support tech didn't help either. The support tech was incompetent and borderline rude. His supervisor said they couldn't help and said to call the PC manufacturer. Why would I call the PC manufacturer about where to get an HP printer driver? Great product. Absolutely terrible support."
1,Hobbled by horrid software,"Watch out, this unit comes with > 160 MB of software. What are the odds of that working reliably? Besides having a poorly integrated interface, the software doesn't work reliably under Windows. I've had to uninstall/reinstall all the software a couple of times, swap USB ports, power everything off and back on. And this is just to print a sheet of paper!I would recommend sticking with a simpler printer with simple, well-integrated software."
2,Typical Problem,"In many ways...this is a great piece of equipment for people who want a basic second set of office equipment...particularly for home. It has already saved me in several situations when I needed to send a fax, make a few quick copies, etc. Nevertheless, the damn thing has a problem with its paper feeder. More often than not, it picks up too many sheets of paper, has a paper jam, or spits out slightly to extremely crumpled pieces of paper. If not for this...I'd say this is great...unfortunately...this is too major a flaw to overlook."
1,never again!,"we have had so many problems with this printer....and their product support is awful...we continually have to shut down our whole system in order for the printer to work...then after minutes it won't print, we downloaded a new driver, took 8 hours to download, thought that would solve the problem....not on your life!!!!never again will we buy another hp...."
4,Check the model #. Is it also a fax machine?,"I think the reviewer mentioning the Walmart price of one hundred and something did not notice that the printer advertised is the 2210 without the fax function. I almost did not catch this myself. If that is not the case. Nevermind. Now, I must say, the 2210v is a great printer, a great fax machine, and a pretty good scanner. That is all."
1,Bad Software,"Owned this product for about 4 years. The scanner never worked properly because of a software bug. Now that it has finally died, I'm going with a Canon. Their tech support is FAR superior than HP's!"
4,Great product for mice deterrent and it doesn't rust,Great it doesn't rust. goes a long way. Great for keeping out mice and other smallrodents. I would recommend this product to anyone who is having mice problemsentering the house from outside.
5,Good stuff,This was inexpensive and easy to install and it has kept sparrows out of the tiles on our roof.
5,Copper Mesh,"If it wasn't for Amazon I wouldn't know about this item. Our upstairs storage space is below the attic had evidence of mice, I bought two rolls of this stuffed it along the floor boards and wall attached to the attic. I think i got it all the spaces so far no evidence of mice. When I have time will use on the basement sills. Easy to work with cuts with scissors. Some pieces I cut in half to fill larger area. Nice clean product."
5,kept the mice out,"I have had a problem with mice for years and this is the only thing that kept them out. You have to place it in any opening that you think they can get in, which is what I did and it really worked. They cannot chew through this product."
5,Heaven and Earth by Nora Roberts,"I'm absolutely in love with books written by Nora Roberts. She is a wonderful storyteller. She's funny, whimsical, passionate, perplexing and practically holds out till the end before you know what they're going to do. Thanks Nora."
3,Entertaining,Compared to some of Nora's other books the three ebooks were whimsical rather than a richer romance mystery. I liked following all three characters throughout their discovery process and the fellas were delightful. A good read when you in the mood for a light touch story.
4,Heaven and Earth,"Ripley Todd is a deputy on Three Sisters, and also a reluctant witch. Nell, Ripley, and Mia are witches that descended from the original three sisters on the island. Eager for some independence and privacy, she plans to rent Mia's cottage, but is upset to learn it is already rented to MacAllister Booke. Ripley is further irritated to find out he is there to do research about witchcraft.While Ripley is attracted to Mac, she will have to let go of some of her hostilities and past hurt to let him in. With the visions, dreams, and paranormal events that happen when they are together, it is evident they are connected. Ripley will need the help of her sisters to survive the threat that awaits her.This is Ripley's story of the three and while she is integral, I wasn't very fond of her character. She is abrasive and harsh to everyone. She did grow on me as the story went on."
5,A Pure Heaven!,"I really did like this book! Once I started - I couldn't put it down. I can't wait for the third book to come out so I can find out how it all end with the three ""sisters"". Thanks alot Nora!"
5,Heaven and Earth,"This book was great! It is the second book in a trilogy about three women whose ancestors were witches. Something went terribly wrong and now years later it's up to these three women, also witches, to set things right. I have also read the first book in this trilogy and can't wait for the final book to come out. If you don't read this book, it's your loss."
3,Good but not as Good as the first,"Heaven and Earth was a good read but not as good as the first of the triology 'Dance Upon The Air'. This second of the three books, dealt with the headstrong deputy Ripley Todd, and a new love interest Mac Brooks. Though the story was nice and interesting, it fell short of the intriguing story of Ripley's brother handsome Sheriff Zack Todd and the mysterious Nell. That was spell binding. I find myself reading the first story, 'Dance Upon The Air' once again for the third time. Though I did enjoy the second I feel reading it once will be enough. I do enjoy the sisterhood of Nell, Mia and Ripley. I am now looking forward to the third!!! I hope that Nell and Zack could possibly find a way to a fourth in this series:-)Ripley and Mac are nice, Zack and Nell are HOT"
2,Not impressed,"Being a fan of Nora Roberts, I was very excited when I found the first installment of this trilogy at a book exchange. After devouring Dance Upon Air, I could hardly wait for the second book. I expected more of the elements that made the first book so great: good plot, likable characters, a bit of mystery and a lot of romance.Although the plot is fine, the novel fell short of my high expectations. The main character, Ripley Todd, is too obnoxious and difficult for the reader to become attached to (you wonder how a man as wonderful as Dr. Booke can fall for her), and the build-up to the end is a bit confusing.Make sure you read Dance Upon Air before picking up this book, otherwise there will be some loose ends regarding the paranormal story line and secondary characters Nell and Zack Todd.The book is readable and entertaining, but not Nora Roberts at her best. However, I will eagerly await the final installment and hope for more of the magic she spun in the first book!"
5,Three Sisters Island Trilogy,"I so love this book, and am looking forward to getting the next one in the trilogy. Nora Roberts really is a most wonderful writter, there isnt any of her Irish books I dont like. Nora Roberts books are wonderful reads that you dont want to put down as well as they make you feel like you actually know the characters"
4,Fiesty,I liked the book. I loved the whole series. Ripley was fiesty and funny. Mac was cute. Showing his intelligence but also clumsy. Very cute. Ripley dealing with who she and what she is. Really good book.
4,Definitely more earth than heaven,"Book 2 in the Three Sisters Island Trilogy had me reading with bated breath as I wondered whether I would actually like Ripley Todd. Abrasive, harsh, rude and somewhat full of herself, I couldn't quite figure out a) how she had a brother like Zach and b) how she had friends like Nell & Mia. But after persevering and getting through the story, I realised that like most of us, Ripley had two faces. One that she showed to the world to let them know that she's a tough, no-nonsense cop and another where we see the woman behind the facade.Her story might not be as dramatic as Nell's and she certainly doesn't have you rooting for her from the start, but eventually you get to the point where you can bear her. Then you begin to like her and wonder how long it will take before she lets Mac in. In the end, you wonder why it took her so long!Another rainy day, snuggled in the couch good read."
3,Good read-but nothing extraordinary,"I have been reading Nora Roberts long before she became a ""New York Times"" Bestselling author. I enjoyed the first in this series and was overjoyed when I finally purchased the 2nd book. I don't know whether I like Ripley or not, and how does that make for a good book when you are doubting whether the protaganist in the book is likeable?The magical part & the brief information about Mia & Ripley's past is good-but all this book did was make me like Mia more and Ripley less. A book worth reading-but not with excitement."
4,I could hardly wait for another great read,"I could hardly wait to pick this second book up and start reading. I'm told by friends that I'm a lot like Ripley,sarcastic and mushy underneath. I love the way Mac talks to Ripley and still manages to be Mac the lover and still be Mac the scientist. I also think its great how her brother Zach is so understanding of Ripley's rudeness. Had any of us done that kind of rudeness in real life we would probably be fired from our job,or be kicked out of the house. Ripley is a strong woman and a good cop. She acts so mean because deep down she's scared and doesn't like dealing with strong and intense feelings that she can't control.I think its wonderful how Mac and Zach help her get past it and deal with it,now if only Mia,could stop snarling all snotty like at Ripley..."
5,Great Sequel to Dance Upon the Air,"I was totally looking forward to reading about Ripley and I was not disappointed with ""Heaven and Earth""! Here, we see the sweet side of Ripley warring with her usual sarcastic and cynical self. No matter how much Ripley is fighting it, she can't help but fall for Mac and his awesome bod. I cannot wait for Mia and Sam's story. All the little inuendoes in ""Heaven and Earth"" make me want to see Sam on his hands and knees begging and pleading for Mia to let him back in her life, but that's probably not going to happen. Can't wait for the third story!"
2,Didn't like it much,"Been listening to this series on audio cd's. I liked the first one 'cause it had a story and a little witchcraft. This one, however, had very little story and a ton of witchcraft stuff. I didn't like the main character, Ripley. She was always angry and yelling and cussing at everyone. I assume the next book will be about the last witch, Mia. The whole premise of all this witchcraft didn't make alot of sense to me and the constant spells and chantings I found annoying. Where did the author come up with this stuff? Is she really into this so much? I just hope the last one is better. I liked Nell, the character in the first book, but not this Ripley character. Hope Mia is at least likeable in the last of the series or I won't finish listening to the whole mess."
4,Enjoyment,All 3 of the books were a fun read. The story and the characters were very enjoyable. Picture the location. I really wanted to go there.
4,Witchcraft and romance- What's not to like?,"While this book, like the first in the series, lacks some depth, it makes it up with intense scenes, full of steam and laughter. More of the legend is revealed, as well as more insights for all the main characters.Ripley is a hard nosed cop who doesn't want to admit that she has a few extra talents, and along comes Mac, a paranormal scientist. Needless to say that he's interested in more than her occult abilities! This book was enjoyable and very easy to read. The ending was slightly disappointing, but the rest of the book was well worth my time. Can't wait to see if the legend is totally explained in the last book"
3,"Ok, My 2nd Nora Roberts Book","I truly enjoy the characters in these books, but I feel like there is a lack of depth and substance to the entire plot. The paranormal and the witch idea is fun but with the relationships involved, it is very shallow in this story. I am thinking that maybe if she wrote this series about the sisters in the 1600's that founded Three Sisters Island then she just might have had something there. I am still confused on what exactly was happening back then...How did that sister Air ever meet that awful man if they hid out on that island???? Either Nora is just producing too many books, or I am just not into this Romance type. At any rate I do plan to read the last book when it comes out in June...hopefully it will have more to tie this trilogy up."
4,A new Nora Roberts Fan!!!,"I always put off reading her novels up to this point, but her story line of the Three Sister Island caught my attention. I am hooked, and can't wait until the next one comes out. I felt like she was talking to me about my sisters. We grew up on the East Coast, & even though the women in the book weren't blood sisters, they acted as if they were. The dynamics between the characters are so real, I hope she gets the new one out early."
5,Heaven and Earth (Nora Roberts),"Nora Roberts really knows how to spin a tale. The only problem with the trilogy is that I hate to wait for the next installment.Robert'stories are not the typical ""Romance Novels""."
3,book bought,The book was in decent shape...it took a while to receive compared to other books I have purchased but it was acceptable.
3,"Kind of boring, isn't it?","Well, I love Nora Roberts, and I really like Dance Upon the Air, but this one I found kind of boring. I love witches, but Ripley seems kind of too-bitchy. I know the bitchy woman and the understanding man is a must have for any romance novel, but this one seems kind of S and M if you know what I mean. But it is worth reading if you want to complete the trilogy, but the Gallaghers of Ardmore is much better."
4,Just Loved It,"I loved the first book but I definitely enjoyed the second more this is a great storyline. Love intrigue and magic, a great combination."
5,I'm in love w/ Deputy Ripley Todd and Dr. Macallister Booke,"I loved getting to know the other sisters, Nell and Mia, but Ripley is by far my favorite. She is so...vulnerable but with this tough outer shell that she believes no one can see past. Something about seeing that shell punctured by Mac is so endearing...I honestly could not put this book down. Rip and Mac are a wonderful couple and compliment each other so well that I felt they were almost real. (And the love scenes raised my own temp a few thousand degrees if ya know what I mean!) ;)However, the books get even better with the intertwined stories of the three sisters and the challenges they each have to face in order to break a centuries-old curse. Really, truly amazing trilogy, but this book is the best in my opinion. Probably my favorite of all of Nora's books, and I'm a die-hard fan."
5,A great fast read,"This book was awesome. I really enjoyed it. It picks up right where the 1st book left off, and a new man is coming to the island to do a report on Mia. He ends up falling in love with Ripley. During this time Mac runs tests and uses his computers and what not to get readings of the 3 sisters. Ripley sences something and feels she has to fend it off. The bad thing is Nell's ex-husband's soul gets in to a journalist and he makes his way to the island...on a misson for the ex-husband...to kill. Its a fast read and you should check it out"
4,Good read,"I do agree with others that it isn't as good as the first book. But, it is a trilogy and I still had to know what happened. Ripley did frustrate me though - as I read others shared the same opinion... but maybe she was supposed to? Still it was a good story and I found it hard to put down."
3,"Ok, My 2nd Nora Roberts Book","I truly enjoy the characters in these books, but I feel like there is a lack of depth and substance to the entire plot. The paranormal and the witch idea is fun but with the relationships involved, it is very shallow in this story. I am thinking that maybe if she wrote this series about the sisters in the 1600's that founded Three Sisters Island then she just might have had something there. I am still confused on what exactly was happening back then...How did that sister Air ever meet that awful man if they hid out on that island???? Either Nora is just producing too many books, or I am just not into this Romance type. At any rate I do plan to read the last book when it comes out in June...hopefully it will have more to tie this trilogy up.Sorry to having to disagree with all these 5 star ratings but I read many types of books and this is just not the caliber I am use to."
5,Nora Roberts Heaven and Earth,Great little book. It grabbed hold of me and didn't let go until I came to the end. Couldn't wait to read the next in the Three Sister's Island trilogy
2,TRIES TOO HARD,"I LOVED THE FIRST OF THE TRILOGY. LIKEABLE CHARACTERS, GREAT PLOT, WELL WRITTEN. RIPLEY IS THOROUGHLY UNLIKEABLE, OBNOXIOUS AND I FIND IT HARD TO CARE ANYTHING ABOUT HER. I AM SINCERELY HOPING THE THIRD BOOK STAYS MORE IN LINE WITH THE FIRST AND AM EAGERLY WAITING FOR IT TO ARRIVE....."
2,Puhleeze,"The first book in the trilogy was fine, other than it's remarkable similarity to the Julia Roberts movie ""sleeping with the enemy"", it was an enjoyable read. This book was just stupid. The plot just kind of meandered on until the completely unbelievable, and almost science fiction climax. And who exactly was the villain in this book? Roberts couldn't seem to make up her mind. Was it the crazy x-husband? Looked like it until you realize he was possessed by something. Was it the fame hungry reporter? Again, kinda looked like it, woops he's possesed too. But by what or who? That answer was really never given. Angry that I even wasted my time with such a stupid read. Nora Roberts, you have just lost a fan."
3,A little confusing,"Although I like the story and think it has great potential, the writing is a little hard to follow. I never read the first book but never have had problems before like I did with this one. There would be pages and pages I would read and have no idea what was going on. I also got lost in all the descriptive language used much too often. I like this book, and think the characters are interesting, but it's not suspenseful. I guess if you read this one you should try the first one in the series first."
5,Three Sisters Island,"Usually I am disappointed in trilogies, but in this case the 2nd book was as good, if not better, than the first. Can't wait for the third book to come out. If you like a little bit of fantasy mixed with mystery, you will really enjoy these books."
3,Can't really lose with Nora Roberts,"I absolutely love Nora Roberts and have devoured every one of her books. This was OK by her standards.I liked Ripley's story more than I did with Nell's (Dance Upon the Air). Although Ripley can be a *itch, I was drawn to her strength and her fierce need to protect those she loves. And what can I say about Mac - nerdy, cute, built, and rich....what more can a girl ask for??"
1,Disappointed with Heaven and Earth,"I ordered hard cover in very good condition and received a used soft cover!!! For the money I spent,I could have had a new hard cover! I could not find the persons name or address to complain."
2,"okay, not great","This book was better than the first of the series (which was ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" meets ""Bewitched""). The characters were interesting, but the conflict was not well drawn and kind of boring, and well, weird at the very end. Buy it used or check out at the library."
2,Not my type of book,This was a gift for Christmas that was not requested however I did read it and found it to be not my type of book.
3,Ripley is not that likeable,"The fact that I've read everything she's ever written probably doesn't help, but I find lately that after an engaging first book the second and third books in recent Nora trilogies always give me a sense of déjà vue. The notable exception being the Key trilogy.Otherwise it's a vintage Nora with a predictable romantic plot. I found myself getting slightly annoyed with the characters. Mostly because I had a feeling I had met them before and this was just another re-incarnation. Also, Ripley was not that likeable. I had trouble understanding what our boockish hero saw in her. Tough his chosen field probably gave him tough skin. All in all it wasn't a very satisfying read."
5,Loved it!,Dance Upon the Air was great and I really enjoyed it but this second installment was terrific. I guess I relate to Ripley (what a scary thought that is) but I like her candor and her courage and her fierce protectiveness. Cannot wait for Mia's story.
2,Just not connecting with these sisters,"I read someone's review of the first book and laughed out loud...she said ""Bewitched vs. Sleeping with the Enemy"" that summed it up so perfectly for me. The second book could be ""Fox Mulder meets Xena"" I am just not getting this series. I normally LOVE her small town stories, I adore her supernatural books, I especially recommend Midnight Bayou, but I am just not into these books. I do have to say though that even on a bad day Nora Robert's books are better than everyone else is so I will of course buy the 3rd book."
1,Where was the romance?,I liked nothing about any of the characters.I didn't find anything good about the heroine and I don't know how could the hero really fall for her. It didn't make sense since he was lusting after Mia almost to the end.Mia the former best friend of Riply was a wicked witch only without a broom who constantly stabbed Riply in the back by bringing her down in front of Mac.... and supposedly she still loves her friend very much and misses her terribly.....What the hell?
2,"Great Power, Battery but too fast.","I got this impact driver to replace my Bosch 14 volt. The bosch worked great, but the battery would run down fairly fast.The Makita, with it's Lithium battery runs all day long. I previously had gotten a Makita Lithium drill/driver to replace one of my Porter Cable NiCad cordless drills, and I love it.The problem with this Makita is that there isn't enough ""feel"" in the trigger. It's very hard to slowly startup when screwing in something. The driver wants to go right to full speed, so you slip out of the screw or tear up the head.The balance of the driver is fantastic, and fit and finish is normal Makita quality, but I'm sad now that I sold my Bosch for the sake of extra run time."
4,after 6 weeks of use,A hard working impact driver with long lasting power. In the wood working/construction side of things the price is very high as the 12 volt version only differs in the run time between charges. Battery life is very long and appears to be 1 1/2 times or more of the 12volt unit. just a little over priced at the moment.
5,Power beyond power!!,"I bought this impact driver for am upcoming deck project. I have tested it out a few times so far. I installed a bunch of 1/4""x4"" lags into studs w/o predrilling and BURIED them so deep as to countersink the hex heads. Oops! Makes them kind of a bear to remove. This thing has oodles of power. But it is great for driving small screws as well. I still am using the residual charge that was in the battery when it arrived, so I haven't got to try out the cool charger with the fan cooling yet. I cannot wait to use it on the deck. You will NOT be dissappointed. I have read in some reviews comments about the noise. While it is noisy, I do not find it noisy enough to really warrant ear protection. Maybe if you were using it for a long period of time ...."
3,It's the end of the world as we know it.,"I've always been a sucker for ""end of the world"" themes in literature and cinema. Having enjoyed such efforts as ""Threads,"" ""Testament,"" and ""The Day After,"" I decided to give this film a shot. And it was pretty good, but if you're looking for great special effects involving nuclear devastation, you'd better look elsewhere. With the exception of one REALLY haunting image of the sky lighting up with a thermonuclear fireball just outside windows of the White House, this film takes a more subtle approach, focusing on the fear and confusion amongst top brass when a rogue attack triggers a nuclear exchange. This film is more in the tradition of ""Fail Safe."" Not bad, but not that great either."
4,End of Cold War DOOMSDAY Drama!,"This is a good film for those of you who like Doomsday Scenarios. The Cold War is over now, but still the scenarios linger. This drama explores an (accidental yet plausible) scenario. Along the lines of Sidney Lumet's Failsafe and/or the Bedford Incident. This film shows how situations can escalate out of proportion quickly to nightmarish results. Not a lot of extras on this DVD though, but still classic late 80's early 90's pre-Paristroika Paranoia."
4,By Dawn's Early Light,"This movie is about what could happen if someone or country, were to accidently or on purpose launch a nuclear missle. There is lots of drama and suspense, with actors you know well. A very good movie, worth seeing."
2,By Dawn's Early Light,"I saw a glimpse of this movie earlier on HBO and was interested enough to purchase the DVD. Too bad I didn't watch the movie first when it was free! James Earl Jone's acting abilities were wasted on this movie, and I won't comment on the others.I'm glad that our armed forces are not as inept as portrayedin this film. Sorry I can't be more complimentary, but....."
1,Worst Bomber Movie Ever,"This movie is ridiculous! I am an aircrew member on the B-1B bomber and this film is so far from reality I can't even begin to tear it apart. For one, most of the scenes are on airplanes and the dialouge is very quiet and touching. There is no way you can talk like that on an airplane in flight. Especially after a guy ejects!!! And the love story between the pilots? Just ridiculous! All the face stroking and peaceful banter, ridiculous! We have to yell at the top of our lungs to talk in the jet off headset. So STUPID!!!! DO NOT waste your time with this movie."
2,This movie sucks,"Ok, i will only give this movie a few credits, the flight models are good and accurate, and the topic of the Cold War and World War 3 is a good one. But other than that... The acting is horrible.... And this movie is also unrealistic in some aspects. I mean, dropping a nuclear bomb just to take out two MiGs that were following in ""close pursuit"". Give me a break."
2,This is a grade B Movie at best.,"Well I certainly hate to disagree with all the other glowing reviews of this movie but quite frankly I wasn't impressed. Granted the movie (and subject matter) are dated but I found the acting to be only average, at times almost mechanical - not very realistic. Not very good chemistry between De Mornay & Boothe. The special effects could have been done better. This movie probably had a low budget.Sadly, I bought the movie based on the reviews posted here. Do yourself a favor and rent it (if you can find it). Had I rented it first I would have saved a few bucks.Don't get me wrong, the movie will keep your attention but I found it to be fairly predictable. Finding two pilots willing to make the ultimate sacrifice at the same moment seems a little far fetched !!!"
2,Horrible acting...,"The topic is interesting and could well have been explored more in movies, but: The acting is really bad. Are the actors instructed in a way to make them under-perform? The psychology is absolutely not-believable. The stage sets smell ""cheap"" long way. And the technical details sound just wrong, or are obviously wrong and under-researched. - I felt I was watching a movie from the seventies."
4,By Dawn's Early Light,A classic war film. Put's a new spin on how things can spiral out of control. Highly recommend
3,Good but flawed,People who were a part of the Cold War saw holes big enough to drive a B-52 through.A good yarn but a technically flawed. The writers were too busy dumping on the military-industrial complex and trigger-happy politicians to actually get it right.There was enough of a good story here to keep me from flushing it but there were big problems with facts like the Continuity of Goverenment(COG) Plan and SIOP (Single Integrated Operational Plan).Writers do your research! SOme of us were there and know when you are spinning Bravo Sierra.
4,Excellent cold-war thriller,"This was a made-for-TV movie that was unusually good, with an awesome cast. Powers Boothe and Rebecca De Mornay star as the pilot and co-pilot of a nuclear-armed B-52 bomber. James Earl Jones co-stars in another nuclear-war film (SEE: ""Dr. Strangelove""), only this time it's serious. The only problem with this DVD is that there are NO special features; no trailers, no featurettes, no nothing. Otherwise, a great film and a must-see."
4,Cold War gets Hot,This movie is about the unthinkable--nuclear war. It follows the lives of key military/government figures and a bomber squad as they live through the horrors of a nuclear strike and must figure out what to do next. The cast has some really talented actors in the early part of their career.
4,WHAT SO PROUDLY WE HAILED,"Although the movie is fifteen years old now, its message is potently timely. BY DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT revolves around what happens when terrorists nuke a Russian city and make it look like the US did the deed. Retaliations ensue and the movie becomes a frightening chase to stop further annihilation. When it appears that President Martin Landau has been killed, he is replaced by warmonger Darren McGavin who is paired up with another hawk, Rip Torn. They decide the only way to WIN the war is to take out the leaders. A subplot involves lover pilots Powers Boothe and Rebecca DeMornay who are piloting the bomber set to do the dirty deed. The tense what if scenario is played out beautifully, with acting kudos to Landau, McGavin and Jeffrey DeMunn who plays a soldier who wants everything to stop, but is hogtied by McGavin and Torn. Along with FAIL SAFE and DR. STRANGELOVE, BY DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT is a hearty testimonial against nuclear weapons."
2,How Much Do You Need?,"I bought this book for research. It was very disappointing for that purpose. There were streets that were listed followed by verbiage that said nothing about the origin of the street name. Moreover some of the most interesting stories of Memphis streets are left out of the book and most of the street names that are talked about are obscure to me, a life-long resident."
5,Fantastic,I have used this information already. It's required reading in today's world where so many of our younger folks are considering so many other options. It's a compelling book.
4,Strobel is a Genius!,"While reading this book, I was not able to put it down. It feed me with information that I have been seeking and trying to do the research on my own was exhausting. I applaud the author for his wisdom, and his obedience in writing this book."
4,good,"Good, Great product! I recommend it!Nice timing, great price, perfect for students budget. I do not regret my purchase"
4,A Refutation of Dr. Daniel Block's opinion,"For some who have grown up in a church atmosphere or who have an open, receptive heart, Dr. Block's point may be applicable. But for many who have grown up outside the atmosphere of Christianity or have witnessed many so-called ""Christians"" who claim a faith in which they do not live by, this is definitely worthwhile reading. I have seen many who have grown up in the shadows of academia who have benefitted from ANY ""evidence that demands a verdict."" Worth reading if you have doubts or unsure about making a decision. Anything that can give direction toward Christ is worth the effort if it reaches but one. I give a thumbs up for its value."
3,"Biased, but some good info","About what you would expect from an Evangelical author. Some good points, some stretches, and some irrelevancies which do nothing to support his claims. On page 107 Lee feels he needs to attack the Book of Mormon which does nothing to make his point on the validity of the Bible or Jesus. So why is it there? Filler? Agenda? He mentions how the Smithsonian does not use the Book of Mormon as an archeological guide. He doesn't mention the Smithsonian doesn't use the Bible either. He also gets facts wrong which are a result of depending on John Weldon and John Ankerberg for sources on Mormon history. A reviewer here, Jonathan Widger also gets facts wrong about Joseph Smith. He was never ""convicted"" on any of those charges. I do agree, however that martyrdom does not prove character."
3,"Good, but DRY","If you can trudge through all this info, its great. Its just really a tough read i found. There's a lot of other great apologetic books out there that are a faster read."
2,"Good Evidence, Bad Analysis","Strobel's book takes us deep into evidence from scholars on the issues of Christ and more exact: Is Christ the Son of God? Perhaps reading a book or trying to find evidence is not the way to start this task... however, revelation is.God is not an object to be pondered, God should be seen as a person to be encountered. Thus, we cannot know God unless God reveals himself to us. As seen in Matthew 16:15 and bit after that... A book to be read regarding this topic should be: ""Natural Theology: Comprising ""Nature and Grace"" by Professor Dr. Emil Brunner and the Reply ""No!"" by Dr. Karl Barth.""Strobel's book can make you feel good about compelling evidence regarding Christology... yet without revelation and without God giving God's self to be known to an alienated humanity, we can never know who God is.Where is the Holy Spirit in Strobel's case?"
2,The Case For Christ,"The book was a diasppointment. The use of modern day case historys at the beginning of each chapter is irrelevant and boring. Mr Strobel uses apparent fulfillment of Old Testament prophesys as proof of the New Testament Christ, when the Hebrew Canon itself is suspect. I'm afraid those looking for an historical Christ will have to look elsewhere."
2,Blech,"First, let me state that I'm not a skeptic, so my rating of this book has nothing to do with my personal view of Christ.I really was genuinely interest when I read the introduction, but a short while after, I had to force myself to read the next five chapters before I completely gave up. Maybe it's only a matter of taste, but the style of this book is too painful to read. The historical facts and other evidence are interesting enough, but they are lost between irrelevant thoughts and actions (""He uncrossed his leg."" ""He sat up."" ""Blah blah blah."") Oh, those are all very fascinating details and deeply affect my view on Christ.I'll admit I know nothing about journalism, but I think it would be better if Stroble would just eliminate the anecdotes and say what he'd learned straight to the point instead of beating around the bush."
1,Preaching to the choir.,Pentecostals will rejoice. Those with open minds will not be swayed. I cannot help but feel that the author is pandering to the lowest common denominator .... very much like the failed rock stars who turn to gospel music to make a buck. Any mindful person will see this for what it is. The close-minded who cannot see beyond their own narrow ideas of what faith is will cling to this for dear life -- affirmation of their limited world view.
5,Case for Christ a Great Read!!,"Whether you don't believe at all or are doubtful Jesus was who He claimed to be, or are a true believer who wants to strengthen or share his or her faith, this is a wonderful book. Lee takes the reader from his own convictions as an atheist, one who studied the sacred Biblical and secular historical writings and challenged the experts only after his wife became born-again. Ultimately, Lee became convinced Jesus is indeed everything He claimed to be and was born-again.The Case for Christ is a very engaging read as well; Lee begins each chapter briefly explaining how his own experiences as an investigative reporter lead him to interview each chosen expert before diving into the ""tough, point-blank"" interviews only a seasoned reporter could conduct. Difficult to put down... from Introduction to the Final Page. Highly recommended!"
2,Sadly Lacking in Persuasion-- Only for The Uncritical,"Strobel sets up a number of straw men in this book, and then knocks them down: ""Critics say that Jesus was such and such-- but Expert X says diferent!!!"" This is his method, and it gets tiresome quickly, for many reasons. First, he does little to lay out reputable criticisms, picking and choosing those arguments he wishes to refute. Then he goes to his experts, all of whom are (surprise!) Christian professors who destroy the straw argument, leaving us little choice but to agree that, indeed, Christ actually did this or that miracle. As an example of rational argumentation, the book gets zero stars, though it's at times entertaining. There's an excellent book waiting to be written on this topic. This ain't it."
1,Horrible 'objective' research,"He only interviews believers, he barely puts up fights against outrageous claims, and accepts historical examples as reason to believe in the Christian doctrine.The book even says religion can't be accepted from facts, only from faith (aka blind acceptance) of a holy book. So why did he spend a whole book trying to prove it when he says himself that it can't be proven? Because this book is made for people on the fence of faith to push them over to the Christian side, it's not written to inform a reader about historical events during the first century. It's an absolutely horrible book."
5,Best Book Evet!,"This book is amazing if you have questions about the validity of the life of Christ and the resurrection, or want evidence and information to back up your beliefs."
4,"Not the greatest, but very interesting","Lee Strobel could have gone deeper. As the book is, it seems he only brushed the surface. Personally, I think he should have interviewed skeptic scholars as well to see what they had to say.However, most of the arguments are very interesting and are at least worth checking into. It does show that not all scholars are anti-Christian, as so many people think. It also shows that even though skeptics (and even skeptic scholars) ask tough questions there are answers for them that are least worth mulling over a bit. It's not as if Christians are ignorant and don't delve into the history and facts themselves.Don't take anyone's word for this book, or any Christian book, especially the Bible. Read them for yourself and really study them."
1,Frustrating reading,"Books by apologists frustrate me because as I read, counter-arguments enter my head and the authors just ignore them! I could barely get through Lee Strobel's ""The Case for Christ"" because of his infuriating tendency to pretend he was getting at all the facts. He claimed he was being impartial but he never challenged the ""experts"" he questioned; he just accepted all they had to say. Is this the new journalism?Anyone honestly interested in the truth won't read apologists' books without also searching for skeptical rebuttal. Lucky for us, Earl Doherty's ""Challenging the Verdict"" is a comprehensive response to Strobel's book highlighting all the arguments Strobel conveniently left out or glossed over.Don't read one without reading the other!"
4,It makes a strong case!,"I found the book by Lee Strobel to be very well written and well documented. He makes and supports the case for the veracity of the scriptures and the position that Jesus was truly the Christ, the promised Messiah. I strongly recommend this book to both believing Christians, to help them in responding to questions about the deity of Christ and also to those who are still in doubt and searching for the truth about Jesus and their salvation."
4,This book really confirms my beliefs.,"Even though I consider myself a conservative Christian, I still find it hard to explain a lot about Jesus. This book really put a lot of questions ""to bed"" for me. Readers don't listen to all the 1&2 star reviews, read it for yourself and watch the truth unfold! This book really answers a lot of questions that I have had over the years and you do not have to be a theologian to understand what is being said. I do wish that more opposite views were expressed, a little one sided yes, but he does express the most popular atheistic views that are out their, is it all of them, no, but that would be beyond the scope of this book. this book is excellent and really strengthened my beliefs."
1,Terrible reasoning,"""The Case for Christianity"" is a terrible book, and the only way the conclusions could be reached would be if Lee Strobel WASN'T an atheist, but already a Christian. The reasoning was awful - 'I can't explain this, it must be God. And if it's God, it can't be a general God, it MUST be Christ!' Or... ""This New Testament researcher who's a Christian SEEMS to be using flawed and biased knowledge, therefore he MUST be correct! There's surely no need to talk to someone less biased who would know about the New Testament.""I read this book AS a Christian, and I recognized it for what it truly is: tripe for fundies that are so convinced already, that this sort of reasoning is allowed to continue."
2,"simplistic, dishonest, and very disappointing","In a time when ""source criticism"" has provided new insights into the period, and equally well-intentioned people are reaching sometimes provocative conclusions about the reality and the identity of Jesus, this book is profoundly disappointing. I would adopt the description of an earlier reviewer, that Mr. Strobel is ""preaching to the choir"". The questions posed to advocates ( a better description than 'scholars' ), are softballs that make a Larry King interview look incisive. The failure to acknowledge the possible illegitimacy of helpful passages in ancient writings is dishonest and unforgiveable. I will blame myself for not investigating the author before purchasing the book. I regret supporting this work, and strongly advise the inquisitive, open-minded reader to look elsewhere."
5,Must read,"I highly recommend this book for those who study the Bible. Tremendous time and effort has been invested in this scholarly research by an atheist. This is a must read book, those who are seeking peace in this hostile world."
5,Recommended for All,"For the seeker, this book provides evidence as to how the Bible can be determined as historically true. The description of the crucifixion was a clincher for me. For anyone who wonders why this is important, there are plenty of opposing views in this book. The author started out an atheist wanting to prove his view was correct, not a Christian out to prove a point. Mr. Strobel also recommends that those who still have questions to research and find your own answers. I recommend this not only to seekers, but also to those already mature in the faith."
4,Some interesting questions,"I liked this book if for no other reason than Strobel asked some questions of the experts that I wanted asked. You can take their answers and debate them as you will. But at least he asked the questions many others want to ask and he got answers. For example, I did not know that the Gospels were written much closer to the death of Jesus than was the histories of many other famous figures (e.g., Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan) who were written hundreds of years after their deaths."
5,An Excellent Read,"Lee Strobel does an amazing job interviewing the leading scholars in their respective fields. Anybody who can read this and honestly say that the NT isn't historically reliable clearly isn't reading with an open mind. A must read for anyone who is unsure of the NT, or simply wants to strengthen their faith."
2,Journalism? Has anyone seen the journalism?,"This book reads like a Bush Town hall meeting; you only get in if you agree.I am so disappointed in this book. Not one dissenter in the group. Not one! How on earth do you build a case like this without doing comparative research? Even Penn and Teller do that!Also he intentionally misleads the audience by insinuating that the scientific community believes in the historicity and Godhood of this particular Christ, named Jesus. That is FALSE!!!! The overwhelming majority of the scientific community is made up of atheists, agnostics and skeptics. If Strobel were honest he would have picked the ten top anthropologists in the country and queried them on the historicity of Jesus.Two stars because he has a nice writing style. His investigative Journalism leaves a lot to be desired however....Honestly, what will his new book be about? Querying members of the Heritage foundation about whether or not conservatism is important for America?"
3,Style might appeal to some,"As a ""searcher"" I thought this book would be a great read to help me get a hold on the truths of Christianity. I was dissappointed with this book. Strobel covers most bases, but spends too much time telling me about the experts' offices, coffee-drinking habits, and physical appearance. As a logical/scientific thinker, I wanted something with more meat and more references to outside sources. This book might appeal to someone as a great beginning to Christianity if they appreciate the more dramatic ""hammed up"" style. I'll stick with the deeper thinkers like CS Lewis."
4,do not have time to write review. I am a college student and am very busy,great book.I do not have time for this feedback I am very very busy have much reading to do
4,"Compelling, to an open mind.","We can know the truth. The truth is not relative. The truth sets us free. He (Jesus) is the Way , the Truth, and the Life. Lee Strobel presents a clear and compelling case. This book demonstrates that the Christian faith is reasonable, based on the historical person, Jesus."
5,A life-changing book from a man who was hard to convince!,"The Case for Christ is an interesting account of a man who didn't know Christ, and because of his wife's conversion and this own curiosity decided to take his newspaper reporter nose and check out all the claims to Christ. You can see in each chapter how Mr. Strobel is piecing information together. A facinating account of someone who didn't believe and who came out believing. Christians should read this book because it will revitalize your life in Christ, and others should read it and let his words point the way."
5,A great read!,"This book is incredible. It's changed my outlook considerably. I've always believed in Jesus, but I was so afraid to ask questions about the things I didn't understand. (What if I'm in the wrong faith? Why did Jesus say the Kingdom of God would be seen by those within his lifetime? Why did Jesus say respond the way he did when someone called him ""good""?) The honest, hard-hitting questions by Lee Strobel were refreshing--and the honest, irrefutable answers by the scholars he interviewed were even more so. There's no doubt as to the validity of Christianity anymore, and I fully recommend it for anyone honestly seeking answers, no matter what your religious affiliation. You'll be pleasantly surprised."
3,Interesting,"This is definitely an interesting read, but I think the author should consider the audience that he is targeting; need to explain some of the theories and explanations in more laymans terms for those of us who are not theology majors. I really liked his book ""A Case for the Creator""; but I felt this book was lacking the athiest's perspective; Strobel was biased from the start and it wasn't hard core interviewing. Also, need some women interviewed - all I read was male experts on the subject."
1,Totally Biased,"Although well written, this book is completely biased. The author portends to launch an open-minded, unbiased, and investigative look at the issue. However, ""The Case"" has been resolved in this author's mind, and he clearly presents his biased view throughout the book. A true journalist comes into an investigation with a totally open-mind, and gathers and presents evidence for the reader, who then forms their own conclusion. His conclusion is woven so completely through the contents that I consider it to be useless as part of a true ""investigation"" into the issues. I am not anti-Christ - I am not anti-religion, I am just against the concept of offering an unbiased opinion with forgone conclusions,"
1,Case for what?,"History and science never provided proof that Christ even existed and I see people arguing here whether he resurrected!?I do not think Jesus existed to begin with, we have lot's of proves of Pharaohs, Persians, many Mediterranean civilizations, Hindu kingdoms all of them thousands of years before Christ and still, absolutely no evidence of Christ's existence.Please, just do not tell me Bible proves something, it's just a funny religious book as any other.That being said, I am not some aggressive atheist, I just love the truth more than brainwashing & dogma."
4,another fine strobel book,This is another example where Strobel faces the issues and supports the long held theory that it is more reasonable to be a Christian than an atheist. I believe this book was inspired by Strobel's own journey which led him from atheism to Christianity. Instead of engage in reading to research he interviews experts which enlivens the information with human interest. A committed atheist probably wouldn't enjoy this type of book very much. A genuine enquirer might find themselves on a path to Christianity. A committed Christian who has never been an atheist should take the time to appreciate how well evidenced is their faith.
3,Don't ask questions you may not like the answers,"I read This book years ago when I was doing evangelic work and wanted to study up on apologetics so I could witness better to non believers. The book was an entertaining read but the arguments are easily dismissed and not very convening. Your not going to be converting anyone with the ""evidence"" it purposes. It will only help to shore up your own beliefs.About 2 years ago I admitted to myself that I can't honestly believe in God anymore. I wanted to remain a Christian but through reading the Bible and other books there are just to many contradictions and errors for me to believe whole heartily. I would merely be taking Pascals wager and God would know if he really did exist and was omnipotent. TLDR: Don't get into apologetics if your happy in your faith. It takes years to come to terms with a sudden lose of faith and will only bring you agony."
2,Completely One-Sided,"Yes, he asks some really great questions. But if he's such a great investigative journalist, why didn't he investigate the other side of the argument. And how can all these ""experts"" testify on behalf of someone they never actually met? A psychologist in the book offers evidence that Jesus was not actually insane based on nothing more than stories written about him. That's not evidence!I seriously doubt Lee Strobel was an atheist before he wrote this because he believed these other people so easily. One theologist claims that there is absolutely no dis-agreement on who wrote the Bible, and Strobel just believes him!!!I think people like him, all these other born-again christians, decided to say they used to be an atheist to sell more books.If you can read this book, do yourself a favor and keep asking questions, ask the questions Lee apparently couldn't ask or didn't want to."
1,Misses its audience,"Read these reviews, folks. The arguments in this book only seem to make sense to ""believers"". The cases made in this book are actually highly illogical--even to me, a Christian. A few reviewers wrote off the people who gave this book one star as ""atheists"". But these so-called atheists wouldn't waste their time reading a book like this if they weren't interested in who Christ is. (Would a believer read a book on atheism just for fun?) These so-called atheists are supposedly the audience this book is directed to....and it seems to fail miserably with them. What a missed opportunity!If these are the best arguments Christianity has to offer, we're in trouble."
4,Interesting reading with thought provocing facts.,Stroble does a good job of mixing up his subject interviews as he slowly builds his case for Jesus Christ. He uncovered information that the common person would not be familiar with.
3,You get what you're looking for.,"I've read this book twice, the first time as a Bible literalist Christian and the second time as a skeptic. If you are a Christian seeking to strenghten your faith against secularist attacks, this is the book for you. But if you are a skeptic and you read this book to find out if there is any logical historical claim to Christianity, it will all seem like a joke to you. Lee Strobel only interviews so-called experts who agree with a literalist, fundamentalist, Protestant interpretaion of the Bible. Many of these ""experts"" give arguments along the lines of ""Because we know that 'A' is true, it follows that 'B' is true."" But they never explain how they know that A is true.If you're looking for a consise and pseudo-scholarly book to defend your version of Christianity and tell you things you've already read, this is the perfect book. But if you want a book to truly delve into the origins of the Bible and Christianity, look elsewhere."
2,I feel misled...,"I don't know if it was the cover of the book or what the person giving it to me said about the book, but I was led to believe this was supposed to be an objective account of one person's search for the truth and investigating the evidence supporting Christ.What I got was a series of interviews by a guy who'd been a pastor for 10+ years. And the interviews were strictly of individuals with deep convictions themselves.It is ironic that he keeps referring back to court cases in each chapter, because in court cases, there's both a prosecution and a defense. No such balance exists within the pages of this book.All in all, some of the information provided was interesting, but providing only the barest of commentary from the opposing viewpoint left me wondering what Strobel was trying to hide."
4,Yeah... worth the read...,"Strobel does a great job bringing his journalistic background to the table and interviewing various scholars in their respective areas of expertise to nail down the Truth of the Cross of Christ. This book was refreshing in that it takes you a bit deeper than many popular apologetic books, yet, at the same time gives you personal insight into the character of the scholars and Strobel himself. Very personal style of writing...It's odd in that it reads much like a story... a story of exploration (an introspective Lewis and Clark tale, perhaps). At the same time, though, it will take some time to wade through the arguments and presentations (which are helped along by the fact that you do feel like you're reading a conversation rather than a dissertation)."
5,Excellent Book,I enjoyed the book very much. It addressed many of the thoughts and doubts I have experienced over the years. It only strengthened my faith.
4,"Amazing read, and stunning information","This book answers many of the objections raised by Atheists/Skeptics/ and then some! I'm seeing a lot of negative comments, but this book contains information on the reliability of the Bible, existence of Jesus, and His being God. I've yet to see a good argument against the information in this book, other than the emotional attacks in the comments.(Which goes to show the fact this book has made an impact) I highly recommend it.NEGATIVE: Only problem I have with it is that it can be overwhelming, so be sure you pay attention!"
1,unimpressed,"the author opens describing a murder case. He describes methods used to gather and evaluate evidence. This is supposed to lend credence to his attempt to uncover the truth about Christ.Well, all this really has nothing to do with his search. The book should have been called ""The Case for Jesus."" Much effort is spent trying to prove the existence of Jesus. I think it's safe to say that Jesus actually existed.The author does nothing to convince me that Jesus was the ""Christ."" That Jesus was a man and whether he was the Christ are two different issues.Unless you are already convinced that Jesus was the Christ, don't waste your time."
3,For history/anthro majors,"The book can seem to be dry for the average reader, as it goes over the history in detail. I thought this would be a good book to give to my friends who are filled with doubts about the Chrisitan faith, but I wouldn't give it to them unless they had the history/evidence driven intellect.Case for Faith or Mere Christianity is a much better book to give to a friend with doubts."
1,Still looking for a comprehensive book that discusses all arguments.,"I wish there was a book that OBJECTIVELY reviewed the evidence from AT LEAST TWO PERSPECTIVES, allowing for point-counterpoint analysis and commentary, and for different people to read the book and come away with different conclusions.The evidence is flimsy. The experts are subjective. And he just does not do a good job answering the hundreds of questions that any curious reader/thinker would have as they read this book. He passes them over in silence or with abrupt dismissing."
1,Utter garbage. Another way to get money from believers,"If you're looking for a book that finally gives evidence for the existence of Jesus, this book isn't it. Strobel makes bias assumptions, then sets out to ""prove"" them by interviewing people that already agree with him. The book is only good for being a revenue generator for Strobel, from those that already believe. There is no substance to his statements or arguments, nor any hint of him following a scientific logical proof or methology. Don't waste your money or time."
1,weak and deceptive,"A blatant apologetic presented under the guise of unbiased reporting. Not one person on the ""other side of the argument"" is asked a single question.The author and publisher should be both be criticized for pitching this book as ""investigative journalism""...it is anything but....An insult to any thinking person's intelligence."
2,Entertaining fiction disguised as fact finding.,"I give this book two stars as it is both entertaining and well written. I only give it two stars as it is fiction pretending to be fact.Now to be fair, I'm sure the author believes what he has written to be true and certainly Mr. Strobel felt his questions and the answers provided by those he interviewed were meant to discover the facts in an investigation for evidence of Jesus. Unfortunately, in my opinion, he let his current personal bias belief in the correctness of Christianity to color his words and limit the depth of the investigation as presented. Mr. Strobel too readily accepts answers of the self-proclaimed experts on the New Testament and therefore forfeits the claim of unbiased investigative reporting.Still all-in-all it is a good read, worth a look for those who understand it as the work of a Christian preacher spreading his own particular view of religion."
2,"""Balanced"" in what way?","So, let me get this straight. If I write ""The Case for Green Leprechauns,"" and I proceed to interview every expert on the matter WHO BELIEVES IN GREEN LEPRECHAUNS and not a single one who doesn't, then according to Lee Strobel and his book I would be engaging in ""balanced"" journalism. ?!?!?!"
2,"Don't listen to ""experts""; KNOW your God","Lee Strobel's fascination with and kowtowing to ""expert"" Christians disappointed me. From people like Josh McDowell and C.S. Lewis, I have learned many of the things Strobel found out, but what I learned most from McDowell and Lewis was to follow Jesus to know him. Each of us keeps searching for a mediator between ourselves and God, be it yesterday's priests or today's experts. Yet there is one God, and one Mediator between man and God, Jesus Christ the man, who gave himself as a ransom for all."
2,That's all the evidence?,"This book is portrayed as asking all the hard questions an atheist would bring to Christian scholars. But Lee Strobel's heavy bias in this book makes me doubt his proficiency as a skeptic. He admits to being a committed Christian for years when he wrote this book and therefore fails to bring any objectivity to his subject. I also think a simple presentation of his evidence would have been more readable than the rather elaborate investigative journey plot.Although portrayed as a persuasive argument for unbelievers, I felt this book was written for:Christians; to help bolster any wavering faith in this age of apostasy.Fence sitters; because ""your future and eternity hinge on how you respond to Christ."" p.271I felt Strobel failed in his attempt to provide reasonable evidence for Christ. And he resorts toward the end of the book to thinly veiled scare-them-into-heaven tactics."
1,"If you gave it stars, we can't have read the same book","While I did not expect this book to change my views a jot, I was still respectfully interested when a Christian colleague at work assured me that this was rigorously written for skeptics, with good sourcing, and not all butterflies and blind faith.Well, I don't know if she gave me the correct book (though the author and cover art are the same) but I can't imagine anyone but an already-dyed-in-the-wool true believer not laughing his/her butt off.With no sourcing that didn't feed on theistic myths presented in typical circular fashion, and nothing whatsoever to raise the slightest kernel of ""Hmmm? That's fresh thought worth thinking about"", I call: Sheer drivel."
1,1 star is too generous,"I was given this book by a work colleague after we got into a discussion about theology and whether Jesus's daddy was real etc.I'm glad my expectations were low because boy how they were met.This book seems to be liberally seasoned with just about all the goat poop the author can muster, blend in every logical fallacy in the theists armory and then stir the pot until the waters are sufficiently muddied and ""we can't prove it isn't so it probably is"" crap is all we have left. This book does nothing. It's literary inertia and I want those 3 and half hours of my life back.Next time someone claims they have proof of Jesus better at least have some grainy footage from a pedestal at Calvary Plaza.If anyone's looking for me I'll going back to the science department."
5,Excellent reading and well documented,"This book clearly shows without question, the existence of Jesus Christ, and has supplied numerous documented sources to prove it."
1,boring,didnt finish the book. not interested. a bit of a dry read. i dont belive in god so maybe that is why i dont like it
5,An excellent book,"This is a must-read for so many people who are ignorant about many key points of evidence in favor of Christianity. I checked this book against the criticisms of an atheist website after reading it, and the atheists only successfully pulled down a small handful of the book's points, and none of the main arguments. This book is a very important apologetic work."
4,"well documented, and written!","I would highly recommend reading this book on your search for the ""Light"" and the truth! If you are looking for proof of the hereafter, and Heaven, read this book and give to your friends!"
5,The Case for Christ,"The author is a newspaper journalist specialising in legal reporting. He was an atheist, but after his wife became a Christian he decided to review the evidence for and against Jesus Christ being the Son of God and for the resurrection of Christ. The book is the story of that very thorough review patterned on a legal investigation. It is well written and gripping as a story: the sort of book one finds hard to put down. Suitable for both Christian and non-Christian readers."
4,"A good ""case for Christ""","Lee Strobel aspires to systematically destroy all arguments against the divinity of Jesus. In spite of the title, I think it obvious that Strobel was not writing this as an unbiased journalist searching for an unknown truth. (Also, as I sidebar, I have rarely read a completely unbiased article, all journalist our influenced by their own perceptions of the world when writing.) Instead, ""The Case for Christ"" is written more like an article after the truth has been discovered, interviewing various eyewitnesses of this newly discovered reality. Even so, the main problem with the book is that all interviewees were Christian believers. Sometimes the best argument for a position is to show the inconsistencies of the opposing view. These types of interviews may have strengthened the main thesis of the book."
2,"Not objective, and evidence is too selective","Strobel is hardly objective, having only interviewed those who already agree with him. He criticizes the Jesus Seminar, and Michael Martin, and yet he neglected to interview Martin or anyone from the Seminar. The choice of ""evidences"" is quite selective in this book. The more obvious and damaging contradictions in the New Testament are not even mentioned (such as how Judas died). I gave the book two stars simply because it is an easy read and because it provided the ideas and opinions (regardless of how ridiculous) of many of the ""top"" conservative New Testament scholars of today. I highly recommend those who have read this book to experience some true scholarship and common sense by reading Earl Doherty's ""Challenging the Verdict: A Cross-Examination of Lee Strobel's 'The Case for Christ'""."
2,This case is a surefire mistrial!,"I bought this book to see if the author had put together a credible impartial case for God/Jesus/Christianity, but as usual I was disappointed by the lack of real evidence. It is obvious that the author's training is in journalism because the book is written using a conversational style that is appropriate for those with a six grade education. Anyone who made it to seventh grade and learned critical thinking will see through the weak aguments the book presents.I have never seen a ""case"" with so many holes. The author claims at the outset to present a fair impartial case in this book; however, he only uses witnesses (interviewees) that make positive claims that support his case. This is not responsible writing.If this is the best that Christian apologetics has to offer (and it seems to be based on the popularity of this book) I am even more confirmed in my ExChristian status.Recommend instead: Challenging the Verdict"
3,"Great research, well agrued, but biased","As mentioned in other reviews, only one side of the story is presented. Even on the side for Christ, only evangelicals are interviewed. The evidence presented is compelling. However, because Strobel uses the analogy of presenting eveidence as in a court case, a counter-argument seems to be called for. By including the viewpoint of skeptics he might have made his case stronger. On the other hand, he has created a successful series of titles based on this format, so..."
4,Excellent Reading!,"Against the backdrop of a world that is increasingly against Jesus Christ as the object of our faith, Strobel does an excellent job arguing the case for Christ. Strobel ably applies the strategies of a gifted defense attorney to show that Jesus is indeed portrayed accurately in the Bible, and that Jesus is in fact the Son of God, just as Scripture and Christian tradition has always claimed. Strobel writes in a way that is both engaging and informational. I strongly recommend this book for use in small group study, Sunday School, or other setting that would be conducive to discussion."
5,Excellent Christian Apologetics,"I've read this book several times and given it to friends. I have yet to get negative feedback, even from some of my non-Christian friends. I've been able to use this book very effectively to talk about Jesus to someone and help them to determine what they think about the man from Galilee."
4,Christian Apologetics 101,Strobel has used the most basic of Christian apologetics arguments and built a good case for Christ in this book. It is a good starting point for any inquirer and a good resource for Christians who want to know some basics of how to defend our faith.
5,Don't trust any reviews that are less than 5 stars,"This book is excellent. It is written in a excellent, professional style of writing. He asked very good questions with even better answers. I would recommed this book to Christians and Non-Christians alike. If you don't belive in Christ you might after you finish this book. Truly a masterpiece."
5,Great book presenting the case for Christ,"Strobel does the work of a journalist, interviewing people on different aspects of Christ's life, his self-understanding, and his mission. It's an awesome book. But the result is never in doubt because just about everyone he interviews is conservative evangelical in outlook, so it's not surprising that he comes to the conclusions that he makes. But I believe that he would have had to come to those conclusions anyway because it is true! Jesus is Lord!"
1,"One sided, poorly written","This journalist apparently has only one formula for writing. And that formula doesn't work in book form. Do I care what the experts' offices and clothes look like? Do I care about his every thought as the interviews progressed. This timeline approach to his research was clunky and boring.Beyond the inappropriate yet easily skippable writing style, he does pose some good questions and covered some interesting topics. The debate is engaging, but this book is one sided and despite the title, this is NOT written by an idependent thinker on the topic. The book leaves all counter arguments to Strobel who simply isn't up to the task of debating the heavy theologic thinkers.Instead of ""Judge"" Stroble falls into a bit of the bumbling prosecuter on his thesis that the New Testament is factually accurate beyond a reasonable doubt. Unfortunately this case comes without a proper defense."
5,exceptional!,"I so thrilled to find Lee Strobel. My husband listened to the complete set as he drove between New Mexico and Arizona. We bought a case of Mr. Strobel's books to share at Sunday School. Mr. Strobel's unique and powerful presentation gives us strong and valuable tools to reach out to our family and friends.Thank you and bless you,Merrellee and Dan Moore"
5,actually pretty good,"In my search for my faith, I was recommended Strobel's Case for Christ. It has turned out to be a good choice. Sure Strobel doesn't present everything or even both sides (interviewing a rebuttal expert would have been a welcomed addition). And some of the arguements were weak, like the section on archeology (though I feel that was more the fault of his expert than the evidence out there), the chapter ""Was Jesus Convinced That He Was teh Son of God?, the psychological evidence, the chapter on the evidence of his appearances after death, and the final chapter, the circumstantial evidence. But even after that is said, Strobel's book makes a strong case for the life of Christ as the Son of God. The book makes no apologies for being a book supporting Christianity, but then that is what it is. It's sure to be a true joy for those with faith and I think is valuable for those searching, though only as a starting place and not where you want to stop."
3,Makes a case but no journalistic investigation,"The main title fits, but not the sub-title. As a ""journalist with a legal background"" he makes a case like a lawyer, but does not investigate and inform like a normal journalist is expected to. He does make a good case like a lawyer, setting up strawman arguments which expert witnesses (whose credentials he recites at length) for his side easily and impressively knock down. Another book which actually has a legitimate journalistic tone is ""Gospel Truth"" by Russell Shorto. The contrast is striking. Shorto's book tries to summarize many of the scholars studying the historical Jesus. In comparison, Stroebel's experts turn out to have a fairly narrow slice of the spectrum of views. But that should be expected, once you realize Stroebel is making a case, not presenting a journalistic investigation. That said, the one=sided experts for his case are pretty informative for their views."
3,"OK Apologetics, Annoying Writing Style","Lee Strobel has a very annoying writing style that aims at creating a journalistic tone but comes off as quite contrived and utterly fake. The interviews were somewhat interesting but overall they failed because Lee's questions came across as very softball-like. Interviewing only conservative Christians also shows some dishonesty that does not sit well with a more skeptical audience member like myself.It was a decent introduction to apologetics, although I hoped it would be better. Like any introductory level book, it takes more reading and researching for one to really decide whether Jesus was the risen Son of God. Of course, I am more skeptical than most so that may just be me. I think I'd recommend another book besides this one for introducing a non-believer to Jesus."
4,"Great book, good CD","The Case for Christ is, as a book, a marvelous introduction to historical apologetics. It is well-written in a conversational style, and more importantly it covers a broad range of topics regarding the New Testament and the evidence that Jesus was and is the risen Son of God. (A favorite feature of the book, missing on the CDs, is the recommended reading for those who want to go deeper into the topic of that chapter.)As for the CD version, the reader's voice is clear, and his attempts to give each character his own ""voice"" is appreciated (if occasionally a bit comical) in that it lets the listener know immediately who is speaking in the interview format of the book. What the CD set lacks is a ""table of contents."" If you decide you want to listen to the chapter on the archaeology of the NT, you will have to find it yourself. Other than this, the set is good."
5,"The reviews are a ""hoot"" (and the book is good, too...)","When I first looked at this Amazon site, I had absolutely no intention to write a review. Yet, it seems that everyone else has, so why not get into the act?If the book wasn't effective, it would not have generated as much discussion as it obviously has. Insipid books are not controversial. This book clearly does not fall into the ""insipid"" category.It is a good, thoughtful book. I believe that many of the flaws discussed in some of the posted messages are the result of Mr. Strobel's need to place an incredible amount of material into semi-concise form."
4,Would have made a better documentary..,"This book would have made a much better documentary. This is because it skillfully puts the shoe on the other foot in regards to what is usually presented in such investigations. Stroebel does not interview any sceptic scholars, so the ""case"" is made ""for"" Christ, hence the title. The span of arguments is not definitive, although the ones presented are more than compelling. Don't look for this book to be a panacetic reference for proof of Christ's deity, because it isn't. It does present convincing proof of his existence."
2,Case for Christ,"This product is disappointingly biased. The sources provided as support are disappointingly of the same side of the issue and are useful only for making broad general statements that include ""all"", ""every"", ""completely"", etc. The skeptics side is woefully understated and is not truly explored. In short, this is not a scholarly attempt to present a case and pick a winner, but a fixed-fight in which the fixer had already chosen the round for the fight to end, and just needed to get there without making it too obvious."
1,Watered down formula = recipe for malnutrition,"I am a believer in Christ, his resurrection and his atonement for the sins of all. This book is aimed at babes and doubters but it takes Paul's milk versus meat admonition too far. This is watered down formula --a recipe for malnutrition. Get out your Bible and get on your knees and ignore evangelical inventions and interpolations. God lives!!"
5,"Exciting,reassuring and informative.",I would highly recommend this book to anyone christian or non christian.Read it and do the research it is awsome.
1,Fail!,The very introduction to the book is a perfect analogy of the exact opposite of the author's intention.The author describes his giddiness prior to an interview then pretends to be asking hard hitting questions. And finally he looses all credibility when he assists with breaking down his own question.This is clearly a commissioned work where the conclusion was reached prior to any interviews.Only theologians were interviews. No opposing points of view.Fail. Epic Fail!
1,My 666 cents,"If I only interviewed people who believe the earth is flat, or that we never landed on the moon, or that the Holocaust didn't happen, what do you think I would find? Now, assume I also agree with the people I interviewed about these subjects. What kind of book might I write?Whether or not the one-sidedness of this book illuminates you or bothers you is a personal choice. But ask yourself: what is faith for? Also ask yourself: why did God (or evolution) give you a brain?"
3,Stobel opinion,"Stroble interviews several highly educated theologians. He gives a detailed background of their qualifications. I feel he is attempting to sway the reader into accepting everything these theologians say, as fact. I feel the book is highly opinionated and one sided. A lot of good questions are asked and answered but many questions and view points are left out. It is a book that may reaffirm what you believe but I do not think it will change what you believe."
2,The logic is seriously flawed.,"The logic in this book is so bad that it will only convince those who already believe. Many of the author's arguments can be used to justify completely opposing positions as well. Lee Strobel does NOT, in my opinion, make a very strong case for Christ in this book."
1,A Fairytale For Grown Ups !,"I can understand children believing in fairytales , but I can`t get my head around the fact that adults believe in the biggest fairytale of them all . Something has to explain this lack of logic . Perhaps they`re concerned about the inevitable , and are just comforting themselves ."
1,Causes confusion,"Slick and lawyerly, but with a little study of ancient mythology, astrology, and religion, it's easy to see where the Jesus story came from. I wish it weren't so, but there is not one shred of real scientific evidence that Jesus existed. Instead, the story is based on the ancient Egyption story of Horus."
2,"Only interviews Evangelical experts, too one sided","Needs to interview other types of theological experts not just evangelical. He never studied theology or religion himself. He is a minister in a church that does not require a master's in divinity or theology. The book does not do what it claims it does. He does not interview any sources that are non-biased, which is what a ""journalist"" is supposed to do."
5,An exiting journey with amazing factual back-up,This book is worthy of being read by every single person ever. I can give it no higher praise than that.
1,Not the Final Verdict,"I was nearly ready to accept ""Case for Christ"" as a 4-star last word in defense of Christ and Bibical events, but then I also read ""Challenging the Verdict"", A Cross-Examination of the Case, by Earl Doherty, which exposes the Strobel bias point for point, and in a court room setting. How easily I could have missed this if I had not read further. I think Strobel means well but he sets up interviews to present the evidence he wants to hear so misses the bigger picture, and I almost did too. Don't stop reading. Follow Strobel's book with the easily read ""Challenging the Verdict"", by Earl Doherty."
2,Not Worth Your Time,"I found this book at some points to be interesting, but if I were an atheist, i sure wouldn't be convinced by any of the arguements in this book. None of his arguements are convincing and they lack the sense of being thouroughly thought through. I was able to easily find many holes in his logic and this book did not leave me with a greater affrimation of the life and death of Christ. This is a definate don't-buy."
1,Missing the point,"This book attempts to lay out a case for Christ being the Son of God using evidence. It should be apparent to everyone that this is impossible and that the divinity of Christ is a matter of faith. Mr. Strobel wastes time convincing the reader that Jesus actually died on the cross; Does anyone dispute this? Then he uses majestically circular logic to build his case. The most offensive part of the book, other than the poor prose, is his use of the bible as proof that events in the bible happened. It is just plain dumb. No mention of corroboration, and to top it off Mr.Strobel doesn't ever bother t talk with a rabbi, mulla, or even an informed priest but just with people who have allready reached the conclusion he wishes to promote."
2,Decent Effort But Flawed,"This book will not convince anyone with logic skills who doesn't already believe. If you want to give a skeptic something to think about, try ""God of Jesus"" by Patterson.People like Strobel will end up destroying Christianity by pushing reasonable people away with their stretched beyond all credibility ""logic""."
2,Sheer Propaganda,"This book is not the objective appraisal of the facts it purports to be. It is a one-sided, explanation-laden commentary filled with hyperbole, non-sequiters, and flawed reasoning. The second star is for effort."
4,excellent reading,book was very thought provoking and the bibliography gave a lifetime worth of research.
4,very pleased,"I was very pleased with this book. I'll keep it in my permanent library. It arrived in a timely manner and was in good condition. Thanks, B.Rudd"
4,Jumping Off Point,"Don't expect this book to be the be all/end all of swaying your ""faith"" decision. It is a jumping off point. It sets out basic arguments for why one should even oblige the idea of faith. It raised enough concerns for me to continue a personal theological education. I most enjoyed Chapter 4 which talks about Historians such as Tacitus & Josephus who had mentioned Christ in their historical accounts. This book simply touches on too many subjects for it to go in-depth in any one subject. BUT, if one is serious about their quest, they will research beyond this one book."
3,This is not balanced reporting,The case for Christ is very informative. Lee would have been more honest to portray himself as a lawyer for the defense of the resurrection of Christ rather than a journalist. This book makes a good case but it is not balanced journalism. I highly recommend that you read books authored by some of the fellows of the Jesus Seminar before you return a verdict. The Heart of Christianity by Marcus Borg is a good place to start. Borg gently addresses most of the issues I've had with Christianity since I was a child without throwing the baby (Christianity) out with the bath water. I can still be a Christian without buying the entire package.
4,A Case For Christ,I thought it was very good and very thorough. I would recomment it to anyone who is trying to find Christ but doesn't know how or thinks He doesn't really exist. I'm going to send it to my grand daughter; please pray that she will read it and find Christ for herself.
5,A book that every defender of faith should read,"Nothing replaces the Bible as the final authority on G-d's Word to us. Having said that, we that believe must also teach ourselves how to refute the attacks against Christ and Christianity using love, compassion, faith, and reasoned fact. This book gives you the tools to make a passionate defense of the ultimate Truth."
5,Bought this for a non-believer in Christ,"I have seen this Author speak many times in person at a church I went to in Las Vegas and heard his story so when my 24 year old told me she was not a believer, I talked to my husband and we agreed that with her being a reader, she needed to read this. She is a skeptic who reads a lot of thing on the internet and this will be one way for us to show her this person did his homework and came out on the other side a believer. We are hoping she will see this book as a resource."
5,The Case for Christ,"Just finished this book. Probably one of the most impressive and informative books I've read in my 56 years. Lee presents his 2-year ""prosecution"" of Jesus from the position of an atheist, an attorney, and a seeker of truth. Trying to put to rest, finally, in his mind the innocence or guilt of the claims of Christianity about the Messiah and of the words of Jesus Himself. A powerful search which takes him to the world's leading experts and the only choice left after such a burden of proof...beyond the shadow of a doubt."
1,"So very, very disappointing.","All this hype about a journalist going after the truth. And gues what this one time atheist is now?He may have asked tough questions but he seems to have blindly accepted the answers he received as gospel. One sided and incomplete. Disappointing.A better read would be ""Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism"" and ""Why Christianity Must Change or Die"", both by J.S. Spong."
1,Fundamentalist Christian Propaganda,"The author uses weak straw man arguments to try and prove that Jesus Christ is the Lord and Savior of the world and will judge mankind. I stopped reading in the middle of the book when his pompous attitude started to anger me. The main message of this book is accept Christ as your savior or be separated from God. There is a lot more to the Bible than Adam/Eve, sin, salvation, and hell.I suggest you STAY AWAY from this book and save tour $4!"
5,Best Analysis,"Lee covered a wide area with variety of evidences, which helps any human to establish grounds to BELIEVE & move on."
2,worthy effort but not good enough,"as a christian who often has to defend my faith, i was looking for more supporting materials when i approached this book. what i found is really just a well-intended collection of chit-chats w/ scholars across the country. serious non-Christians seeking the truth have genuine, well-thought-out and deep-rooted concerns, and the book just glazed over too many details to address the lost ones satisfactorily. my opinion is that the author tried to cover too much ground in too few pages. if you want a sweep of the typical questions out there, this might be a good start. but if you want answers beyond half-page summaries, you should look elsewhere.note 1: a minor point, but i don't like to be reminded the author is an ""investigative reporter w/ a legal background"" 20 times.note 2: for deep and proven apologetics, try literature by C.S. Lewis and Francis Scheaffer."
1,Shaky Case --> Shaky Faith,"Lee Strobel's ""Case"" for faith in Christianity's founder is hardly impressive. It is clearly written for a Christian audience, as it would not convert any skeptic who truly lives up to the name ""skeptic."" Its evidence is dubious, when it even exists, and its representatives, while well-spoken, provide little in the way of solid argumentation. But this is just fine for ""skeptical"" Strobel, whose questions seem strangely geared toward the strong points of Christianity. When weak spots in the ""Case"" seem so apparent, it doesn't even occur to Strobel to pop the question. While The Case For Christ may help reassure already ""born again"" believers that their faith is well-grounded, I doubt if any atheist or agnostic would be as convinced. If you are looking for a solid case for Christianity, look somewhere else. If you are just looking for a good laugh, be my guest."
4,Stop debating with yourself!,"We live in a time when we are taught and encouraged to doubt until proof is concrete. ""Innocent until proven guilty."" ""I will believe it when I see it."" To have true faith is difficult. We have moments when our heart says ""I believe"", but then our brains say ""How could that possibly have happened"". This book provides our brain with the historical evidence and intellectual arguments regarding the life of Jesus, that we need to say, ""I believe"" in our hearts and in our minds. An excellent journey for anyone. The reading is sometimes a bit dry with facts, but overall this book is a great investment in spirit."
1,A typical one-sided account,"This book is the epitome of circular-reasoning. Many Christians who read this book find it ""logical."" However, this is one of the most collectively illogical arguments for Christianity I have ever read. I suggest people read the book, but understand there is really no debate going on within its pages. One final note: Strobel likes to portray himself as an attorney. The problem is... a Master of Studies in Law (Strobel's degree) and a Juris Doctorate (which practicing attorneys must possess) are two totally different things."
1,Give us a break!,"I couldn't believe my eyes! Investigative journalist? Come on. With an uninformed, skewed version of the facts, the author has perverted history to show his shallow, ""one-way - right way"" theology. This book would have been much better if it included the TRUTH and then had the journalist actually debate (as we all have to) in his mind what really occurred 2000 yrs. ago."
3,Abridged Edition;only 304 Pages,"1/23/04 The impressive list of critics on Page 1 & 2(incl of some theologians and some university professors) instill the thought immediately to the reader that the book will not be a ""Chapter 1"" wonder with all other chapters attempting to ""just cover those leaf pages"" with ""semantics""... the ""Content Page"" list by Chapter what will be the FAQ and with whom author Lee Strobel will ""discuss it"":(e.g. Chapter 1,2,3, re biographies ""with"" Dr. Craig Blomberg(Chapters 1 &2);Dr. Bruce Metzger (Chapt.3).... Pgs 273-297 has a rather thorough ""Index"",""Notes"" and ""List of Citation"" sections.author Lee Strobel's introduction(Pgs 9-15) again confirms to ""believers"",the falacy which leads to atheistic thinking..an attempt to authenize ""all bible contents"" ""scribed by humans"" before focusing their vision on the awesomeness of the Universe* itself and all within its* boundaries(people,places,things)."
3,More evangelical than intellectual,"This book is extremely interesting, but it is not an openminded overview as the author would lead you to believe. The only scholars directly interviewed are those who are Christians. The conclusions of scholars who do not support the author's position are simply dismissed. Many hard questions, such as eternal hellfire, are not satisfactorily dealt with. Still, it contains material worth reading about...it will appeal the most to Christians who have already made up their minds and enjoy having their positions bolstered. It will irritate those who would like an honest intellectual look at the pros and cons."
3,Hate to lodge dissent,"I hate to be a naysayer but as a former agnostic myself I had heard so much good about this book I was anxious to get my hands on a copy. Perhaps it was the buildup that raised my expectations too high. It is not bad for a book of its kind but nothing different from those who have gone before him down this road of apologetics. Many have disagreed with me on this but I do not think it would work well on the serious agnostic or atheist. Many, I think, would consider it an insult to their intelligence. So from the perspective of this Christian reviewer, you might want to look elsewhere for a book to share with friends. This one is helpful as a faith-booster but not a very good faith-inducer in my opinion; fair but no silver bullet of apologetics."
1,"One-sided, one-dimensional","Lee Strobel pretends to be a skeptical journalist reviewing the evidence for the divinity of Jesus, but its funny how he only consults born-again style Christian experts, most of whom have a personal anecdote about how important Jesus is in their lives, which should immediately set off warning bells if you thought it was unbiased testimony. If you are looking for a serious discussion of the historical Jesus, this is not it. If you are already a myopic devout follower of Christianity and you want further confirmation of the conclusions you have already made, you will enjoy this book. I was really hoping for more meat and thought provoking logic. Alas, none to be found."
1,Just Like Mainstream Journalism...BIASED!!!!,"I was hoping for a ""fair and balanced"" look at this topic despite the author's advocacy of his faith. Instead, Strobel chooses to interview conservative Christians to help ""make the case"" for Christ. Strobel serves up such softball questions during his interviews that the appearance of partisanship is apparent from the outset. If you're a skeptic looking for answers to the hard questions, don't expect Strobel's work here to provide anything beyond a sleeping aid!"
1,"if I could give this book less than one star, I would","This book is presented in the guise of addressed serious questions of the Christian faith in an objective, thorough manner; as a lawyer would defend a case. Listen, if Lee Strobel was defending Christ in a court of law, Christ would be in trouble. No offense. This book may work well for the naive, but is doesn't answer any serious questions regarding the validity of Christianity. Also, notice how everyone he interviews is a ""Dr."" Something. That's to help him prop up his side of the argument. He's hoping that the reader will see the ""Dr."" and not question the evidence. It's downright insulting. If he had good evidence to answer the questions posed, he would need someone with a ""Dr."" in front of their name. He could just use the evidence."
3,Not Persuasive for Skeptics,"After I began attending church and re-engaging with Christianity, a Christian friend recommended this book as a response to my doubts about the resurrection. It backfired terribly. I found Strobel's attitude relentlessly smug, and the arguments abounded with fallacies--straw men attacks, non-sequiturs, and excluded middles.Nonetheless, later I had a conversion experience and became a Christian. I can understand Strobel better now. I would just say be careful when reading or recommending this book. It may work for some, but I suspect for hardcore skeptics it will have the opposite effect."
2,Atheist Review,"I was given this to read by a Christian. There's no science or history to support the writers ""case for christ"", its just other christians who lend their support for his views. There are no non-christians used in support of his arguments.If you believe only Christians can provide truth, then this is your book. If you want a real case for Christ from a skeptic point of view, this is going to leave you hungry."
2,Disappointed,"While Strobel attempts to present this book as a trial, we only hear from the defense, and virtually nothing from the prosecution. Strobel did not set out to clearly look at the issue but rather to reinforce his own views with leading Christian proponents. If you read this book as a Christian, you will still be one. If you don't believe, this will not be a convincing case. If you straddle the line and are not too discriminating in your logic, you may find it plausible."
4,"Very good, but misses some opportunities","The book deals very directly with some of the alleged weaknesses of the Christian faith. However, there are points at which the author fails to deal with some of the most controversial issues. He presents arguments against the faith and then knocks them down--the only problem is that he doesn't present the toughest arguments.I would not recommend this book to a skeptic, it won't deal with all his issues. It is good material for a Christian to read to arm himself with ammunition to knock down many of the arguments against the faith."
4,My review of The Case for Christ...,"This book does exactly what the title says...it makes a strong case for Christ. It can be a little difficult to read a times but is definetly worth rereading a few lines here and there to get the meaning of the subject. Lee Strobel interviews some of the top scholars in the country to give his investigation credibility. I learned so much reading this book. I recommend this book to long time christians and to those who are looking for answers to tough questions. Also recommend Lee Strobel's new book ""The Case For Faith""."
3,song left out,"I don't understand why ""Some Day my Prince will Come"" is left out of this album! I have been looking for an MP3 download from them for this song (it is on the album). I had to record this song from the album I had and it's scratchy.Seems lots of artists have recorded this song in mp3 form except from this group. I loved this song. Would love to know why it is omitted."
5,great listening,"I am pleased to the max. Now I can listen to the recording ""Till"". It has to be one of the most beautiful recordings ever produced."
4,Nostalgia Galore,"I first heard ""'Til"" from a 45 RPM record given to me by my first, one and only ""true love"" in high school (1962). She said this song expressed her feelings toward me better than anything else, which of course blew my young, impressionable mind. Well, I guess the tropic sands turned cold and this young world grew old because she dumped me after about three years. Still, when I listen to this tune, I remember the happy, care-free times we shared, oblivious to the burdens of reality as we were so much in love. I wish life could have been that simple!I bought the album lately to reminisce about 'Til, but was delighted to hear and remember several other nice tunes from that era including ""A Moment Ago"" and ""Cry, Baby Cry"". The Angels were quite good, adept at tweaking my teenage heart-strings. I wish the idyllic life I envisioned while envolved with my first true love could have become a reality!"
4,A pretty good album,"I am writing this review to correct the impression left by the other review. The Angels sound good. Peggy Santiglia, the lead singer, has a lovely voice, which is in great form on this album. there are a couple of Mitch Miller style numbers on this CD, which is why I left it at four rather than five stars."
5,A NEW GLAZUNOV CONVERT,"Glazunov, thinks to this new release on Warner Classics, is revealed as one of the great Rusian romantic composers. Hard to understand why his music is not played as often as Tchaikowvsky.I can guess that it has to do with understanding of the music, and exciting, communicating performances. This new CD has everything: electricity, perfect sonics, and the most musicalinterpretation by Jose Serebrier and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra of Glasgow. The music making is absolutely first class. It is indeed a class act in every sense. I am puzzled by the cover art, which does not seem to fit the contents of the CD, but the liner notes are extremely informative and easy to read. I hope that this is the first of a Glazunov series. It has fully converted me.AndresTampa, Florida"
4,good for dance...,"A was thinking that the mixes come from the original singers. Anyway, the sound is good, and the mixes much more..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS WORTHLESS CONTRAPTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I know that it is a cheap digital camera and my expectations were low, but I was not prepared for just how bad it was. If the picture quality were any worse you would not be able to tell what it was a picture of. I truly have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about when they say that they were impressed with the quality of the photos they took. I really do not think that Amazon should carry such a worthless product. If I sound harsh, buy the camera for yourself and try it out. Then come back here and write your own review."
2,12 Tracks?,"The songs themselves are all pretty decent, Dispenser has been one of my favorite Cursive songs. The problem is they also left a lot out. With all those b-sides and 7-inch tracks you'd think they would have made this compilation more than 12 tracks.If you can't get the tracks elsewhere, buy this, but only as a last resort."
4,just pirated this.,"hah, first review. anyway, i pirated this like a month before it came out, and a friend persuaded me not to listen until it came out and he'd buy me the cd, he's one of those cd buying freaks. so anyway, i slipped on the 7th and i really like it. my favorite song is nostalgia, which is good if you like the newer cursive, and polar and icebreakers are good if you like the old cursive. so anyway, solid cd from my favorite band, but 4 stars because it's not original and the songs don't exactly blow me away, but it's worth a buy. it's very mellow. if you want to check out cursive, i suggest you get domestica and if you're still interested the ugly organ, then this and then the older stuff starting with storms of early summer."
5,Awesome Bible!,"For those who have never read the Bible or found it difficult to understand, this is a great way to hear the Word. You will find yourself anxious and excited to return to listening. Instead of listening to the same old rock and roll, rap or country, download this to your MP3 player and pop it in your car's audio input and get ready for your life to be changed. The fact that different characters read different parts really creates engaging dialogs. The readers all do an excellent job and have good voices that seem appropriate for the part they read. This is a great way to share the Bible with your entire family when you are in the car."
1,Not much use in this format,"Even though the sound is great, the format is terrible. This audio book is NOT divided into chapters. Instead it is divided into several sections which include many books.Thus, if you want to read it as regular book, it may work. But, if you want to read it as you read the Bible -- referring to a certain book or chapter for daily listening, this audio book is not suitable. One will not be able simply complete Numbers and Start Romans.Therefore... good sound, but terrible design. I do not recommend this product."
5,Provides baseline security reminders,This pamphlet sized book is a great training platform for keeping awareness up to par in your organization. It provides a baseline security reminder for 20 of the most key aspects of information security initiatives in an enterprise. This would be a useful aid in a classroom security review program or awareness training course. The points are simple and well written and apply to all users of a network environment.
5,just got it,I just received this unit after waiting 8 weeks on back order. So far it does everything I had hoped for. It doesnt say it in the spec's but I just put in a dvd-r data disk that I made to back up my photos and it started playing a slide show of them. Looks like a great way to show photos to friends. It does the same thing when I connected a 4 gig thumb drive to it with photos on it.
2,Misnamed,"This item - by no means can be classified as actual casserole dishes. They are so tiny that they are more suited to condiment holders or individual dip holders. One has already chipped. Not worth the cost, for how tiny they are. In comparison to the ramekins that I ordered by the same maker, these are more the size of 2oz. The ramekins are 6 oz and cost the same for the same amount received, 4. At this price, I would not recommend anyone buy these. And I would recommend to the maker, rename them. Miniature Casserole Dishes does not suit, unless you are talking about a toy kitchen for a child."
4,Nice mini dishes,"I got these free with another purchase. First off, there is no way they are worth nearly twenty-five dollars for the set of four. Emile Henry ware is expensive, though. And they are tiny and should not be called ""casserole"" dishes. I likely would have been peeved if I had purchased these for full price.However, I have come to love these little dishes. At first, I thought I would never use them, but I do use them frequently. I consider them more like a condiment cup / ramekin. They are nice quality ceramic and the colors are pleasant (not too bright). I use them to hold olive oil for dipping bread, for ketchup and dipping sauces and to hold spices. They are great for melting a couple of tablespoons of butter in the microwave. They are really cute dishes and I have been happy with them. Five stars for quality and function, reduced rating for price/value."
1,If only I'd spent just a little bit more!,"I was feeling broke when my fax died and I thought, why bother with one of those more expensive faxes? You just need a basic machine-- go for this one.Oy. Big mistake. I hate it. Instead of a tidy ink cartridge, you have to use a cumbersome Ink Film roll, which never goes in right, and when you finally do cram it in, it gets used up so quickly, you're always getting caught short.This is one of those moments when you realize the reason a machine is so [inexpensive] is because it is cheaply made. The plastic is flimsy, no parts line up quite the way they should.When this breaks, and I have no doubt that time will come soon enough, I will figure out other ways to economize-- and spring for a sturdier model. And absolutely one that does not rely on ""patent pending"" (why bother?) genuine Panasonic Ink Film."
1,A terrible machine,"This is the worst fax machine I have ever used. The paper feed constantly jams or, worse, never grabs the paper to begin with. If you try to send a multi-page fax you have to feed it in one page at a time. I also loathe the ""film roll"" cartridges, which are messy and difficult to install, as well as expensive."
5,Great fax/answering machine,"This is agreat fax/answering machine. It's simple and works as an integrated unit. We bought one about 12 years ago and used it a lot. When it broke, we went to replace it and I bought the exact same model. The same supplies still fit. I am glad to see that once they found a good design they kept it."
3,Panasonic KX-FHD351 Plain Paper Fax Machine,"This is older (film roll) technology, but is a good, basic fax machine for those who do not need advanced features. It faxes well enough and copies reasonably well, though there is a tendency for it to double feed pages. It is an especially good machine for older people who only need a simple fax/copier for light usage and with capabilities for telephone, speed dialing and a built-in answering machine. These additional capabilities all work quite well.Note: The Panasonic replacement film rolls are still available in office supply stores for about $30, but you can also find these rolls on-line for about $10 through Amazon suppliers."
1,Poor performer,"I'm owned this about a year. It's my 4th Panosonic Fax/answering machine I've had and virtually nothing works reilably on it. On humid summer days I have to hand feed Faxes through it. The answering machine cuts off about 1 in 5 callers, and equally annoying, if there's a prompt hangup, from a telemarketer for example, it records 20 seconds of busy signal. None of my other Panosonic's performed like this.If it had never worked I would have returned it. But it worked randomly enough to use up its warranty."
1,Don't Buy this Machine,"I bought this machine to replace an older model. The first time I tried to fax or copy, the gears inside banged and clacked and the fax was continually interrupted. Apparently the gears are unbalanced. This model is a cheap version of my old one and is not good value. I could not find a phone number to discuss with Amazon how to proceed. Apparently Amazon doesn't want you to call them even when something they sell is defective. I called Panasonic and was required to give them a credit card number before they would send a new one which I will get in a couple of weeks. They promised not to charge it unless I don't return the ""dog"" I received in the first place. Hopefully, the new one will work OK, but I have my doubts. This machine is not worth having. Don't buy electronics from Amazon."
1,Panasonic Fax Answering Machine,Very unhappy with quality of machine. The first fax (3 pages) that I sent jammed during transmission and all 3 pages went as one. Also the paper after transmission comes out at the top and not bottom of machine so it curls over on itself. Poor design.Quality of speaker was bad. Lots of static.I returned it!
5,"Love, Where to start?","Christine here takes the reader with her as she expolers the art, the profession, the skill we all posess but still is a notion few get to be as it is...... the good of the soul.She defines, explores, redefines and explodes the subject. We can all learn from the wise pages of this book. It is a book for the heart, the soul and the hungry mind."
2,Music: An Appreciation,"I purchased it here because it was supposed to be cheaper. It was only about 10 bucks cheaper than the college's price and the seller never said the 5 CD's that are supposed to be included weren't in the book. The book itself though was in good condition. All other sellers mentioned the CD's and were about the same price,but they mentioned the CD's because they might be a little scratched or incomplete. This one, nothing."
3,"Well done, with shortcomings","This is an excellent text for a survey course strictly on the history of western classical music. Kamien's experience and scholarship as a teacher and historian cannot be equalled in this area. I don't recommend the chapters on non-western music, jazz and popular music, however. If you are teaching a survey course that is more inclusive, this text is not ideal. Of all the western classical music texts I have used in my teaching, Kamien's accompanying CD compilation contains the nicest performances."
3,"80""s music LOVE IT!!","A 3 disc set with all the Top 50 hits in the 80's. What more can you ask for? Disc 1 has all the good songs that I can remember hearing on the radio waves. Disc 2 & 3 are good, but personally, Disc 1 is my favorite. For the price, 3 disc set is a bang for the buck. The mixes that are incorporated into each of the songs are good and not too repetitive.Great for those looking to get a CD as gift for a friend that is stuck in the 80's or want to find a 80's collection of songs for his/her pleasure."
4,Pleased with bowl,Nice bowl. It is exactly as I expected it to be. using bowl for decoration as well as a fruit bowl for fresh fruit.
3,Small Salad Serving Bowl,Color is a little darker then photo. Size is good for a smaller salad serving bowl or chips. Typical solid fiesta ware materials.
5,Just the Right Bowl,This Fiesta bowl is so attractive. I am using it as a decoration to hold seasonal fruits. It is just as versatile to use as a serving bowl. The tangerine color is so right for the autumn months.
1,Sturdy but ugly,"The color on this is uneven and very dark its suposed to be cobalt, but is black to indigo. Don't be fooled by the picture, this bowl is very dark there is none of the vibrancy seen in the picture, except where the glaze is thin on the outside in odd ridges, there the color is closer to a pale indigo. This creates an unatractive stripping that looks cheap. But there is very little blue or cobalt color to this bowl."
1,unsatisfied,Unsatisfied. Never received the item.. Waited 8 wks before canceling order. Purchased item at Macy's
1,I did not receive the adverstized product,I think this concept is a good one when you want to learn another language but I have requested the book and CD's. I received a book and cassettes.I would like to return this please.
4,Pomme,"Some like Assimil: some don't. Used following Assimil's instructions, the course will give good results. It will not make you fluent, but with other materials (grammars, dictionaries, reading books) it is possible to makeevery day conversation without any real difficulties. Assimil also has the ""perfectionnement"" series which offers more advanced Italian. I don't know if the series can be found in English. The recordings are excellent, and the focus is on what life is like in Italy."
5,"For the price, guys, you can't go wrong!","Harrap's Compact dictionary is a great value--over 100,000 words for approximately $5.00. It rivals its bigger brothers and sisters at a fraction of the cost!"
3,Not The Best And Not The Worst,"I'd describe this shaver as very middle of the road. The better Braun shavers give a much closer shave. What is great about this one is the cleaning. Just run it under hot water and it's as clean as when you took it our of the box. If I had to do it again, I'd spend a bit more and get the next model up. By the way..allow plenty of time to open the package."
3,Very Average,"This is the third electric shaver made by Braun that I've owned. The others were 1980's models and more expensive, but they were well worth it. The motor on this seems underpowered and I do not like the double cutter/foil system at all when compared to the old models. This double foil system seems more like a marketing ploy than an answer to a better shave. Double blade manual razors like the Gillette Trac II are long known to be far superior to the old single edge razors. The same theory does not seem to apply to electrics. The main problem is probably the cutter. A very small and light weight thing that does not have the heft of the much larger cutters that would go on a single foil razor.In a nutshell, the shave is not as smooth and fast as it could be. Battery life is just average and the trimmer is pretty useless. Wet/dry feature is nice but not enough to make me love this thing. Still, it is a Braun and not bad for the price, hence the 3 stars."
1,DON'T TRUST ON THIS PRODUCT,"PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS LIE FROM GILLETTE. I'VE PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT ASSUMING THAT IT WOULD HAVE WORLDWIDE AUTOVOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT. A BIG LIE. THIS IS WHAT IS PRINTED ON THE PACKAGE BOX (100~240v), BUT WHEN OPENING IT, I FOUND OUT THAT THE SHAVER CHARGER WORKS ONLY IN 110V!!!SO, IF YOU PLAN TO TRAVEL, THIS IS WORTHLESS (REMEMBER, ALL COUNTRIES IN EUROPE AND IN MANY OTHER PLACES ARE 220V).I HAVE TRIED TO CONTACT BRAUN SEVERAL TIMES BUT THEY HAVE REFUSED TO ANSWER OR TO ASSUME THEIR BIG MISTAKE!BRAUN PRODUCTS USED TO BE GOOD, BUT THIS WAS PAST."
1,A worthless piece of junk,"I knew I was in trouble when it took me about 20 minutes to get it out of the packaging. Get ready to use brute force to just tear open the plastic packaging because there's no easy way in.On the other hand, don't bother. This shaver simply doesn't get the job done. I have a few days growth on a very patchy beard, and it barely makes a dent in it. It's like using a lawn mower with a very dull blade, you keep going over the same patch about 10 times before it does anything. I haven't regretted a purchase this much for a long, long time. I'm glad I didn't throw away my shaving cream and disposable razors. Too bad there's not a zero star rating."
4,beautiful,"So lovely. I owned this book years ago and somehow it was misplaced in one of my moves. I remembered the beauty and impact of the photographs, so I ordered it again. Very glad that I did."
1,DO NOT BUY- HARDLY AUDIBLE,"The sound on this DVD is so bad, it is barely audible at full volume. A waste of time.This DVD was done in 1991. I had just finished watching a 1951 TV broadcasts of Toscanini with the NBC Symphony and that sound was vital and clear."
3,About HK strawberry pretzels,2/3 flavor. Most likely to arrive messy n all sticky to eachother. But it's ok.
2,Not Deluxe,This might be a rugged little lamp but it really doesn't give off enough light to be a table lamp. It's only a flashlight size bulb covered by a shade. The only way to get enough light is to take off the shade.
4,Battery Powered Lamp,Good little lamp for the price..It could be a little brighter though..If it was used constantly buying batteries would get to be expensive...
2,Lamp won't turn off without removing batteries,"I cannot get the lamp to turn off without removing the batteries. The instructions state: ""Push the on/off switch once to turn the light on in the ""HIGH"" setting, twice for the ""LOW"" setting, and a third time to turn the light off.""However, my lamp is stuck in the on position. This is only my second time using the lamp. The first time, all settings worked. :-/Also, in case you were thinking of purchasing this as a bedside lamp, it is not bright enough to read by, even when I remove the lampshade. It's great if you want just a little bit of light (maybe you don't like sleeping in the dark).I do like that there is a clock on the lamp. If you have really bad eyesight, it might be too small for you. For most people, the visibility should be fine.In general, I cannot recommend this lamp since it will be very frustrating for me if I have to remove the batteries each time. Anyone else have this problem?"
1,Lamp Didn't Work -- At All,"We bought this lamp specifically for when we lose electric power. But, when we, finally, tried to use it this week (June 30, 2012) , the lamp simply did not work -- at all. The clock worked, but not the lamp. I bought this lamp through Amazon, but I, nevertheless, called Coleman about the lamp. They told me that they had not made this model for some time. Indeed, Coleman, as far as I can tell, does not show this lamp on its website. This was a wasted purchase, both in terms of money and use."
5,Best battery powered lamp,"this was a gift for one of several cousins who were affected by Hurricane Sandy. After Hurricane Iniki devastated Kauai 20 years ago, I found these lamps to be almost indispensable. The light was bright enough to read by, the base was wide enough so that the lamp did not tip over, and best of all since it is battery powered it is NOT a fire hazard."
1,Poorly Made,"While the light works fine, the metal piece upon which the shade rests is flimsy and does not hold the shade upright. Plus, the shade rests too low on the unit to provide the amount of light this lantern should provide. Taking the shade off produces a blinding result not unlike a third-degree interrogation. I'm surprised that Coleman, usually a reliable brand, has produced such a shoddy product."
3,Getting ready for he Hurricane Season,"I had a problem getting the batteries in, because I couldn't, for some reason remove the tab. But my granddaughter put them together easily."
5,Great Solution,"I have two 3635 PDA's that no longer hold a charge at all. I was skeptical if this battery would revive my Ipaq, but, to my surprise IT DID?I installed the battery into each PDA to make sure it would power it and it did.I've just order a 2nd battery.I was afraid I'd have to throw away these PDA's I spend a few hundred buck a piece for. But no worry, problem solved and I've given one to the wife and one to the teenager.Highly recommend."
5,IPAQ replacement battery,I received the replacement battery in prompt order. The only problem I had in replacing the IPAQ battery was learning how much pressure I should use to separate the case halves. Thank goodness for the instructions that came with the new battery. The IPAQ has worked as good as new since the replacement. Thank you.
4,Trains,"I have only played the ""Trains"" as I bought this item specifically for the Train portion. I found it absolutely delightful. There are layouts to build, deliveries to make, logic puzzles, matching games... all different kinds of things. My 3 year old loves to watch, my 5 year old can play most of the simpler games without help, and there are longer, more complicated challenges to keep me interested. Really, this is the first train game my 5 year old has been able to play unassisted, so from that aspect alone, it's been a big hit! (We're a train family, so we've tried a variety of different train software games.)"
3,20 years makes a big difference,"The latest version of this book is quite an improvement over the original version. It has explanations, examples (java) and is actually complete. However, comparing this book to the MIT Algorithms book is a joke. This book is for a BA in Comp Sci and the MIT book is for BS or BE in Comp Sci. If you want a cook-book, then get this one. If you want to understand the algorithms, then get the MIT Algorithms book."
2,Not good for Kindle Paperwhite,I like the book and it is easily readable on my Mac or my iPad. I prefer reading on my Kindle Paperwhite but this book does not display well. The issue is diagrams and code blocks have a white background which causes the text to be very faint. I have to increase the brightness and then strain my eyes to see what the code block says.When reading this book on the iPad the text has a colored background so the code blocks stand out very well. On the Paperwhite there is no background color which is fine but for some reason the white background in the code block makes the code block very hard to read.If you want to read this book on the Kindle Paperwhite I can't recommend that you buy it.
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I'm a beginning programmer and was looking for a book to compliment ""Code Complete"". I purchased this book for My Kindle Fire and am disapointed.It seems to be a reference text book and didn't translate cleanly to the fire. I tried returning, but it was past Amazon's 7 day return."
4,Fairly straightforward,"I enjoyed this book. For the few chapters I needed to read to understand my lectures better, it helped to clarify things in ways that complemented my professor very well.I enjoyed the ease of reading for many chapters, but some of them went way beyond my course and got too complex."
4,Great Foundations,This book is a great foundation for learning the fundamentals of developing software algorithms. I would recommend that the author consider a second addition that would include using the SCALA programming language in addition to the JAVA language.
3,could have been a lot better,"There are quite a lot of typos and errors. Though the book's website has a list of those errors, it's not very helpful because you won't refer to that webpage while you are reading. It's already a 4th Edition of the book but the rate of error is very alarming. Could have been a lot better."
1,Prone to hardware failure,"All HP Scanjets, EXCEPT HP Scanjet 2300c, are equipped with an exclusive combination of two sensors: Staggered pixel CCD and Tri-linear CCD.Also...Long story, short: In a period of exactly 2 years, I've seen two HP Scanjet 2300c scanners fail due to hardware issues. My original newly-bought HP Scanjet 2300c couldn't slide the moving device under the glass all the way after less than a year. A year after that, the refurbished HP Scanjet 2300c replacement, sent by HP to replace the original, had a lamp failure, causing heavily faded images with green tint. HP tech support also suggested interference with other electronics near the scanner (speakers, monitors, computer...).Perhaps I was terribly unlucky. The HP Scanjet 2300c had excellent quality...when it worked. But reliability and lifespan are both important as well."
4,Great for what it is.,"This scanner works out just fine for home or office for basic scanning and the photos are quality. Sure there are better, faster and more expensive scanners out there, but for the price this is darn nice. Installation is cake. Also, it really is not that slow. I have seen slower scanners."
4,Works well for us,"I bought this scanner for a computer room in the children's dept of a busy public library. Our computer trainer thought the software was pretty good and although it isn't a fast, high end scanner we are quite happy with it. It's actually a very good scanner for the price."
1,poor quality scanners for a great brand of printers,"i bought a scanner, its an HP Scanjet 3300c flatbed. i thought id buy the best nbame coz all my producs are HP, i like my deskjets but this time i really got frustrated with this. What are the cons: first, its bulky very large and not compact, second, it is not portable it will surely get broken when u travel it around, 3rd hassle in setup as you need all those cables, adapters, cds and when you lose one, goodbye HP scanner, fourth low quality software compare it with Canon's slim scanner and great software HP would look so pathetic and you got nothing to do with it, fifth very poor customer support when it gets broken you either have it replaced immediately by HP, its almost non serviceable, what if it passed your one year warranty?i love HP Deskjet Printers, and their Laser Printers remain the top of its class, but the Scanjet Series would be their water loo, like having products from Jurrrasic Era."
2,Don't buy this scanner,"Don't buy this scanner.Though the hardware is reasonable at the price (but mine malfunctions if placed too close to the computer), the software is truly the worst software of any type that I have seen in recent years. The software has infuriating problems such as refusing to scan an image of standard dimensions unless I preview every scan. As a result this scanner is very hard and very slow to use for scanning printed documents intended to send to an OCR package. I was expecting it to be slow but it is unspeakably slow because the software is VERY slow to laod and initialize and many of the software features can't be used and workarounds are needed at every turn. I was trying to use it on an 800MHz Windows 98 computer. The updated drivers on the HP web site are in some ways worse than the older ones. When you've wrestled with it for an hour to scan in a simple 15 page document you will get the idea. Best avoided if you can find any alternative."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS SCANNER!,"I bought this scanner from Bestbuy, It's issssssslow. Spend few more bucks and get good one."
4,"Honest-to-goodness, the way it really was in the rural South","I know this author as an honest student of his subject. I was much impressed with the accurate description of the physical surroundings and people of the 1860s. The reader can almost smell the aromas and visualize the countryside of the rural South. That, along with the factual presentation of the Yankee raid so well-known in Eastern Carolina, and the fictional romance that symbolically began a healing process between the two sides, makes it a good period piece. The author's easy, uncomplicated writing style results in a good book to relax with on a rainy day."
4,I never tried beef jerky,"One night last week a co-worker had a bag of Jack Link's Teriyaki Beef Jerky. He said to help myself. ""This stuff is good."" I told him.I could not resist it. I wound up going to the little company store, on my break, to buy us another bag.I got a bigger bag of another brand, but Jack Link's is better. I like the taste and the size of the pieces."
2,Waste of money,This jerky is so incredibly dry and doesn't taste like it is beef at all...they sell it at CVS/Walgreens/RiteAid and others so I would advise buying a single bag and see how you like it before getting a 6 pack.
3,"Cute, but watch the sizes","This is a lovely costume, but the sizing is quite deceptive on the site. Be sure to order size small for ages 3-4 (not 4-6) and size medium for ages 5-7 (not 8-10), etc."
4,Halloween Costume / Pink Barbie Cat,This costume is so cute!! Especially for those chilly evening Trick or Treat nights in Ohio. Thank you!
1,* Un-reliable product - Turns off in a while,"* I want to return this product. Not userfriendly, Box received withoutComputer connection cable. Turns off by-itself in a while on startup."
3,easy to follow-but not so good at explaining,"The projects in the book are really very cute, it's really easy to follow if you know what you are doing. I would be happier if they gave illustrations of the special techniques they introduce, b/c many of them are advanced level, and their instructions are complicated to understand just by reading."
4,Excellent book...beware the toe up stocking,"I love this book. The illustrations are beautiful and I look forward to making many of the projects. I am currently taking a ""Christmas Stocking"" class at my local yarn shop. I decided on the snowflake stocking pattern. The ""toe up"" method is wonderful once completed, however, the instructions were somewhat confusing. Having said this, I would still make this stocking again. My next project will be the felted ornaments and as a self-proclaimed ""Christmas nut"" I am sure there will be many gifts resulting from this book as well. Thanks so much."
3,Nice projects hard to find yarn,"There were a few projects that I would like to do. However, most projects weren't too unique - I found similar ones in other books. There were a few that were odd and wouldn't do. When I decided to do one of the projects, I couldn't find the yarn recommended and spent a long time searching for a comparable one. In general they use high end, nice yarns."
5,holidays knits,this book came quickly.it was in perfect condition .the pictures in the book are great.i would recomned this book as a christmas present for someone who knit .mary
4,Some nice patterns,"I was able to check this out of the library, and now it is on my wishlist. While there is nothing out of the ordinary here, I like the patterns that I am seeing. They are for good basic things--hats, scarves, mittens, etc. I like how the mittens have wide range of sizes for both children and adults.It is not a learn to knit book. The help section in the back doesn't have many pictures, so you may have to consult another reference if you need help. But, an advanced beginner (I consider myself intermediate)and on should enjoy this book.The yarns used are on the more expensive side, so you may have to do some substituting."
5,Blends science with a cultural overview,"Universal Foam blends science with a cultural overview and history of the physical world, from the simple soap bubble to the history of foam science. It's unusual to find a book devoted to foam science alone: this has a surprising amount of facts packed into a review of how foam operates."
2,Office 2000 is better,"Microsoft is still successfully putting out their fabulous Office suite. Office 2000 was the perfect piece of software. In my experience, it was reasonably stable, had great options, and ran efficiently. I couldn't imagine anything else that needed to be added. Unfortunately, Office XP is a lot slower and just doesn't have such a polished feel to it like 2000 does. It feels overly bogged down with unnecessary graphics (especially on the menus) and is a lot slower than 2000.Sure, its still a good product and I only give it 2 stars by comparison to 2000. There is absolutely no reason to upgrade! Don't get tricked by Microsoft. If you are buying Office for the first time, see if you can find a copy of 2000 somewhere."
2,It is What They Left Out.,"Office XP has a few new features but some of the things you have grown to rely on are gone.For example, in File\Open, you used to be able to type in a word and every file with that word in the title would pop up. No more. Now you have to type in *word* to find your file.If you are drafting documents in both Outlook and Word, the machine will still hang up. I could go on.I have the newest and most powerful hardware and have all the MS-Office products. I have used them for years. I am not a Microsoft basher. I am just very disappointed in this product.As a publisher, author of 28 Books, 109 revised editions, six translations and over 500 magazine articles as well as a consultant to the book publishing industry, I spend a lot of time using my computer. I need the best tools. Office XP is an expensive disappointment.Dan Poynter, Para Publishing."
1,ITS NOT WORTH IT!!,"I being trying the beta version for quite sometime, and i say if ur happy with OFFICE 2000 Premier (which officeXP professional SE is), stick with it.This version i think is slower because it uses too much graphics as if a business apps should be a game. I say NO!But the good side is that they finally put htm capability on the second cd which is PUBLISHER 2002 (lets u save to html, which is actually good because u can share it as a webpage). So just upgrade your current publisher to publisher 2002!! Because aside from the annoying ""softer"" graphics (similar to winME), I say it basically a waste of your 500 dollars."
1,OFFICE XP,I DONT RECOMEND TO BUY THIS COPY OF OFFICE THE SOFWARE IS THE SAME AS OFFICE 2000 WITH A MORE GRAFIC DISPLAY. YO NEED TO ACTIVATE IT CALLING MICROSOFT AND THEY BY PHONE SPELL A 42 DIGIT NUMBER TO ACTIVATE THE PRODUCT. AND IN THE NUMBER THEY ONLY SPEAK ENGLISH (I ONLY SPEAK SPANISH). THE SOFWARE IS EXPENSIVE AND IS THE SAME AS OFFICE 2000
3,SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTING,"YEAH, THE XP VERSION HAS SOME NICE FEATURES, SUCH AS THE WINDOW PANES, ETC., BUT: WHY DID THEY HAVE TO GO & CREATE THE ""FLAT LOOK"" FOR THE ICONS ON THE TOOLBARS???!!!....WERE THEY TRYING TO SAVE ON MEMORY? I USE THE ICONS A LOT, & I AM USED TO THEIR JUMPING OUT AT ME FROM THE SCREEN. I TOTALLY HATE THIS ""FLAT LOOK"". I CAN'T SEE ANY OF MY ICONS AS WELL ANYMORE. OVERALL OPINION: SINCE THE FUNCTIONALITY IS BASICALLY THE SAME AS WITH ""OFFICE 2000"", I SEE NO REASON TO GO TO THE ""XP"" EDITION."
5,XP Special Edition is Phat,"I have used the Upgrade XP for three weeks an I did presentations with the Powerpoint. It was great and I had no fatal shutdowns. I think they have a winner, again"
1,Website Listing is Misleading,"Do not buy this unless you're a pretty in pink kind of person. I cannot attest to the quality of the product or the effectiveness on delivering the promises for water quality. What I can say is that the bags I ordered were not this beautiful black and white color that the product images display; they were frickin pink. It was a huge disappointment; be cautious in your purchasing, as these are not what Amazon is showing."
1,Not the color in the picture,"I ordered this sand the other day and was expecting it too look like the sand in the picture. Well it does not, it is a pinkish color not black. It is just regular looking sand that is also pretty large as far as sand goes. Not what I expected."
3,Well...,"Im not sure what to say...it Sure doesnt look like the photo. What I got was a standard sand pinky color sand. Its Not the black mix you see above.But i used it,(tank emergancy sure you know how that goes) perhaps they sent me the wrong product but i dont think they did...i think the photo is off."
5,"baby, it's true...",Oh yeah!!! this cd is so... beautiful!!! i like never gonna give you up! It got some strong beats in the background music. I used this song for my excersinig of stretching... thanx mai! you music bring me alive!!!
5,Best FPS Ever Made!!!,This is my favoroute game in the whole world. I have played through it at lest 8 times.
4,"Good gameplay, OK engine quality, very good storyline....","Well, for a game that uses the UNREAL ENGINE, the graphics are pretty disapointing.The music sound tracks are soooo cool!Really cool! And the sound effects are decent. I expected more. And the physic's aren't perfect, but the storyline, voice acting, and game play is great. There are five video modes available: Direct3D, Software Rendering, OpenGL, 3DFX GLIDE, and S3 Metal. Well, I chose OPENGL since my NVIDIA 64MB SDRAM AGP GeForce 2 MX 400/400 with latest drivers worked best and looked best with OpenGL mode, so.(37-42fps avg, on d3d 22-30fps avg). There are many RTS elements in Deus Ex, and the tutorials are very helpful. I recommend this game for RTS/first person shooter game play storyline diggers. :]"
5,this is one great game,"At first I thought this would just be an okay game since I bought it randomly, but right from the start I knew it would be good. The graphics are great and I liked how everything was put together. I found some things very unique in this game such as the inventory display, how certain body parts were affected instead of the entire body, and how you can upgrade different types of skills. It has a very twisted plot that you gotta pay a lot attention to. Deus Ex (in my opinion) is easily comparable to Half-Life. This game greatly exceeded all my expectations for it!"
3,"Great game, if you can get it to work.","I saw the ""compatible with xp"" sticker so I did not forsee any problems. It took about a week of trying different install kernels, editing .ini files, mounting disk images, and various other things to try and install this in XP. Eventually I just had to install it on a win2000 machine and move all the folders to mine via flash thumb drive.But if you can get it to install it is a great atmospheric game. A good mix between KOTOR and Perfect Dark."
4,"Excellent, amazing game!","This game is really one of the best games I have ever played. It's kind of old, though, so don't expect state of the art graphics.Recommended? Yes. Yes it is."
3,Deus Excrement,"I played this game a few months ago, and I never got into it. I'm not really into sci/fi games in the first place, and it didn't help that the storyline was a little [off] if existent at all.The graphics were ok for its time and I enjoyed the idea of sneaking around guards, taking them out one by one, and the idea of hacking computers to get info and working the cameras(i'm a programmer what can I say). The sound and sound track lacked much to be desired.I had to make myself play it sometimes, because I always have to finish what I start, before I can move on to another game. Half-Life sucked this game out into space down a black hole. The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 was the graphics and the unique gameplay.After all is said and done it must have been a bad year for gamers for this to get a Game of the Year award."
2,Accelerate THIS!,"I suppose this game would be great fun if only you have the accelerator that it requires. After I discovered that it wouldn't run on our very new, very high-tech PC, I tried to find the accelerator that it required, to no avail."
4,"At first sucks, but over time gets addicting and fun!","When I first played this game I hated it. But after playing it and giving it a chance I have found out its a really good story based game with fun action. You will get used to the graphics, or I did anyway, if you don't mind out-dated graphics. Which again, I hated the graphics at FIRST but they don't bother me now. This is just a fun game for people who like RPG's and games that let you choose if you want to play it like a Stealth game or a full shoot-em-up Action game."
5,An amazing game,"This game is over six years old. And it beats everything I've played until now.Firstly, though, this game is not a shoot 'em up and not Quake like. This is not Tombraider.This game is immersive. You go into the game's environment, and you start to care about the characters in the game. You get a sense of wonder about the environments and the scenarios.You will like this game if you like spy movies and you like games with multiple solutions."
5,"The only ""Shoot-anything-that-moves"" game that I like","I'm not a ""Shoot to kill"" kind of guy, and since ""Wolfstein"", that I had a personal interest in fighting nazies, I never really liked that kind of games., they bored me. And then I borrowed ""Deus Ex"" from a friend. The plot is fascinating, the graphics are good and gives a pretty realistic view, and the world, even though fantastic, is believeable (Which means that it is acceptable by logic that such a world can exist.).""Deus Ex"" is the only game that I found myself breathing faster, and focusing all my senses, before I passed a corner, knowing that something is waiting behind it.Shortly: Great Story, amazing Graphics, cool weapons, BUY IT!"
5,This shaver is great!,"I bought this shaver after reading a review that gave it 5 stars. I can see why. This shaver shaves really close - closer than my old shaver, a Braun 5414. (Probably the previous version) It's got a good trimmer but not great in that you have to shave over the area again to get some of the remaining stubble. Otherwise this shaver is great!! It gets the little hairs on my neck and under my chin in just a couple of swipes. And on the first charge, I got 14 good, sharp shaves. I'm on the second charge now and the power is still great after 5 shaves. Let's see....two weeks of great shaves, super-sharp blades, powerful battery....how can I not give this shaver any less than 5 stars? It does what I need it to do, and for the $60 price, it's a great deal, too."
3,"excellent quality, poor results","I purchased this razor to replace a Panasonic foil razor that I've used for about three years. I had the dilemna of whether to replace the battery or get a new razor. I purchased the Braun because it has a Nickel Hydride battery instead of a Ni-Cad, which only last a couple of years. I don't doubt the shaver would last a long time, but it just did not do the job my Panasonic did. It was also very loud. The cutters don't come close to the edge of the razor, which makes it impossible to get in tight spaces, like the edge of your sideburns closest to your ears."
3,Braun shaver a disappointment,Purchased because of w-w voltage capability (120-220V AC). Does not provide asclose a shave as a cheap old Remington I have. A loose connection inside the unitmeans recharging has been erratic. Large and bulky shaver is inconvenient forthe frequent traveller.
2,A step backwards for Braun,"I've been using Braun foil shavers for 10 years, and although they haven't always been extremely reliable, at least I've always been happy with the features and performance. Not so with this product. The actual shaving performance is not nearly as good as my Flex Integral that just bit the dust. Also, several good features of my previous Braun shavers have inexplicably been omitted or changed. The new trimmer design (straight instead of the old right-angle design) is particularly disappointing; it really doesn't work at all. There is no lock to keep the shaver from turning on accidentally in your luggage. The charging cord is heavy and bulky; mine kept falling out of the electrical outlet because it was so heavy. I'm going to send this back to Braun to see if they will honor their 30-day satisfaction guarantee. I guess it's time to try another brand."
2,Takes a looooong time to shave.,"I have been using a Norelco for a long time - and so got the Barun 5614 for a change. The shaving is smooth with the 5614 in that my skin does not get irritated at all. But the problem is that after 20 minutes of shaving, I still do not have a clean shave - especially around the chin. So I repeat the shave in those areas and it starts to get irritating. I tried many differnt ways and directions, but the result is pretty much the same. So all in all, it works if you have ample time to stand in front of the mirror till the job gets done - but I dont - so I returned it. I guess you get what you pay for - so now looking for a higher end model.To be fair - I really liked the battery as it kept on running after two weeks of shaving with the initial charge. The case is good and so is the convenience of being able to clean it under water."
3,My Braun razor,"This electric razor is an ok razor. The only good thing about it is, itsquieter than my old one. The pop up trimmer doesn't cut very well at alland for the price I could have done better. I don't care much for Braun. I rate it a three out of five!"
2,Braun Contour Solo 5775,"I have used Braun razors for 20+ years and have always liked them better than other electric razors. I just got the Contour Solo 5775, which was the direct replacement for my prior razor that I loved. Unfortunately, I dropped my old one accidentally and it broke.I have to say I am disappointed in the razor. It just does not shave very well. What used to take 5 minutes or so to shave, now takes at least twice as long.I would not recommend this razor."
1,A disaster of a shaver,"I've had many electric shavers over the years (Norelco, Braun) and this is by far the worst. Had to replace the heads four times in two years; not only did they get dull, but individual blades started falling out. Braun Customer Service blew me off when I questioned this durability as being a lot worse than they claim. It's also noisy and vibrates some. I've always maintained shavers per mfr.'s instructions. Finally shaver started turning itself on at unpredictable times, including the wee hours, and since it's noisy this was annoying. I went back to Norelco."
1,Buy A Different Shaver!!!,"I have tried many different brands, including Norelco, Panasonic, Remington and Braun.Of all brands, the worst shave so far has come from this Braun. It is uncomfortable, difficult to get all of the areas of my face easily, and the trimmer's positioning renders it almost completely useless.AVOID!I can't say which you should get instead of this one, but pick ANY before this."
4,Braun Flex 5580 (U) Rechargeable Batteries,"The Braun Flex 5580 (Universal voltage capability) is the earlier model of the Braun Flex 5614 XP Cord/Cordless.Purchased it with world-wide voltage capability boasted (120-220V - been to China with it, and the carribean - several times). It came with a grooming kit, self containing leather case, and it was rechargeable/cordless. I bought it in 1995.The batteries will no longer hold a charge. I simply need to get a set of Replacement Rechargeable Batteries, but Norelco-Braun-USA representatives will only tell me to take it to an authorized dealer and get ready to pay out of pocket because the warranty is no longer valid.Anybody have any info on replacement rechargeable batteries for this unit?"
3,Not as good as my old Braun,"I purchased this Braun since I had such a good experience with my old Braun (still working after 10 years). It's somewhat of a letdown, as the shave is not as close and the sideburn clipper is definitely inferior. Perhaps Braun put most of their creative energy into the super-expensive Syncro shaving systems. However, the sturdy travel case is nice, and you can't beat the price. In general, Braun's foil shavers work better for me than the rotary heads on Norelco shavers."
3,Women of the Bible,"Women of the BibleGood book, we are currently using it in our women's Bible Study at our church. Good directions and offers questions that prompt discussion."
1,A Bland Waste,"What a waste. Instead of a follow-up to the delightful and well produced ""Romances for Saxophone,"" Branford and Company have released an utterly boring and tedious soporific of a CD with barely one (the final cut) interesting track. I'd go so far as to say the CD is pretty much unlistenable if you expect from Marsalis and Orpheus what we know they can do. The bland cuts on this CD actually grate on my ears they are so milquetoast. If choosing between this and The Offspring, at least go with the musicians who have something to say and say it well in the latter. Look for my copy of ""Creation"" on the auction block."
1,RIP-OFF,"I can't believe I was suckered into buying this piece of worthless junk. I returned it to the store, they gave me a new one, and within one week I had the same problems. The only feature that works is the speaker phone - forget the handset!! I have tried to contact the manufacturer for a refund, also to no avail. Beauty is only skin deep!!"
1,horrible,i wouldn't keep this phone if someone paid me to. The phone has terrible reception. The speakerphone's sound has gaps in it so it is very hard to hear when listening to an automated system. The only good thing is that the time is set and updated automatically during daylight saving. Next!
4,"Classic ""The New Yorker"" articles","I grew up reading ""The New Yorker"" and have always loved this style of writing the most famous of which, contemporaneously, is done by John McPhee. This is good stuff, ""Mr 880"", about the smallest of small-time counterfeiters,was made into a movie. I loved the article when I first read it and it was a treat to read again.Readers should be aware that seven of the twelve articles contained in this book are also found in the author's ""Reporting at Wit's End"" which has 18 articles."
5,WOW True Classic Baseball!!!,"I remember the days of watching this on ESPN and I always wanted the chance to watch it again. You get to see the ""true"" home run hitters, such as Mantle, Aaron, Wagner...and the list goes on. For any true baseball fan this gives you the chance to relive the good ole' days of baseball, and watch home runs hit in classic Wrigley Field. This is nothing like the home run derby of today at the All Star Game, it's better."
3,Clean great...doesn't last,"The solution is and pad are great at cleaning, but once the pad is completely black...you're out of luck. After that it just keeps pushing the lint around the screen."
1,Not Streak free,The cleaning liquid is not streak free - the cleaning handle is OK to use with different cleaning liquids.
4,"Works, takes some fiddling to set up...","I've been running one for a few weeks now and here's the problem I found with the device:The channels that you watch by using the channel up and down button on the remote are unique and distinct from the channels you can record. Most of the folks on here having problems getting it to record are probably stumbling in to this.I connected the unit to an antenna and my cable and had it scan for channels. This populates the list of channels you can watch. You can then press the menu key at a blank screen to enter the device menu, edit your channel list, etc.The channels you can record are dependent on the TV-Guide Channel. You have to program this list completely separately from the main list of watchable channels.Once you get both lists to co-incide with the best quality channels it works perfectly. Getting to that point takes time and lots of fiddling."
5,If you can find one get one,"I've had mine for 3 or 4 years and it has literally saved me $1000's of dollars in cable fees, its a shame they were discontinued.The Tv Guide can be a pain to configure initially but once its done its great.HD quality is great, I have no complaints."
1,TV Guide On Screen Will Go Away with Analog,"I am giving this item 1 star because TV Guide On Screen apparently depends on a signal from an analog TV station. With this unit, you cannot change the time and date manually: you need TV Guide On Screen. Without the clock, a DVR is worthless. Why did Sony engineer such dependence on a soon to be obsolete standard?"
5,Rise of The Wyrm Lord,"Aidan's summer is over and it's time for him to start a new school year in a new school, where he meets head strong Antoinette. After he finds out that she is having weird dreams. Aidan realizes that Antoinette is being called to the Realm and tells her how to get there.This begins Antoinette's journey but before she leaves Aidan's asked her that is she saw his friend's glimpes, the people of the Realm, to try to get him to follow the ture King.This request poses a problem for to fufill it Antoinette will have to disobey directs orders.This book shows how one mistake can harm many people. It is also a book that is hard to put down after you start reading it even if its your fifth time through."
5,Greetings to all Loyal Glimpses!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is an awsome book! I espesialy loved the sword fights. Antoinette's struggle is so easy to relate to. If you like the first book, you'll LOVE the second one. I am dieing for the thrid one to come out!Remember, Never Alone!"
5,Outstanding sequel!!,Another fantastic book to follow up a great story! I would highly recommend this book to anyone who appreciates a tale well told!
4,More solid than the first,"Wayne Thomas Batson's second novel in the Door Within Trilogy is better than the first book. While I had a lesser interest in the first one, this one grabbed me a little harder. I loved the Robin Hood-like society in the trees, and the message here continues strong. As I mentioned in my review of the previous book, if you like Brian Jacques, try these, Wayne Thomas Batson writes in a similar style."
5,Loved it,"Even though this is the second book of a series, I found it easy to understand. Like Narnia, it focuses on another world that is linked to our own. Instead of talking animals, The Realm is populated with Glimpses, each of whom mirrors someone in our own world. More than just the typical sword-and-helm fantasy, Rise of the Wyrm Lord weaves spiritual warfare and realistic characters into its enthralling tale."
4,Finally a phenomenal fantasy!,"I simply want to say that having read much fantasy fiction and falling in love with many of the classics such as Lewis, Tokien, Salvatore, Weiss & Hickmann and others, I am so glad to have read the first 2 books of the Door Within Trilogy.Each is wonderful, exciting, fresh and original.A young man finding himself in a quickly and roughly changing life is wisked away to a magical kingdom that is in fact a spiritual reflection of our own reality. While there he becomes the hero that every person dreams is inside them somewhere and in the process finds that to truly live is to live for the King (allegory to Christ and the Christian life here). The book is absolutely enchanting and touches the soul without ever getting preachy or losing the power of the story.Keep writing! These books shall adorn the shelves of my grandchildren one day!"
4,Awesome book!,"Antoinette, after believing that Alleble exists all her life meets Aidan who knows how to get there. Finding out that she is needed there she goes on the adventure to put a stop to the rising of the Wyrm Lord. Will Paragor succeed? Can Antoinette stop him in the swirling of shadows and setbacks, or will she herself turn to the evil side?"
5,Great!,"This is the second book of a wondrous, thrilling, and page-turning series by Wayne Thomas Batson. In this, Antoinette Reed, a friend of Aidan Thomas, is called to Alleble by king Eliam the Everlasting. Once she arrives, she discovers that she must pass three tests to become a swordmaiden of the realm. She passes all three, and is dubbed Swordmaiden of Alleble. She also receives Gwenne's old sword, Daughter of Light. Finally, Antoinette and a party of eleven others depart to Yewland, because messages from the queen show that Paragor is up to his trickery again, and is deceiving the Yewlanders. But will they even arrive to Yewland arrive? Passing Paragor's forces and through the Blackwood, a dark and forbidding forest, will be no easy task. And even if they arrive, what next? Will Antoinette and her friends have the ability to stop Morgui from waking the Seven Sleepers and the Wyrm Lord before it is too late? Because if they fail, the fate of Alleble may change for the worse."
5,Incredible Book!,"The second in The Door Within Trilogy is even better than the first. Instead of Aiden as the main protagonist, Antoinette (Gwenne's glimpse) is the heroine. In direct contrast to Aiden, at the beginning of this story Antoinette is looking for a way to enter the door within to help the kingdom of Alleble in their time of need. Paragor's armies are amassing with the Wyrm Lord in their head. When she meets Aiden in an art class, Wayne Thomas Batson' story is lifted out of the boundaries of mere words. With his trademark action packed, lightning-paced writing takes you to a place you won't want to leave."
3,Good jams....but....,"Be forwarned - this disc is ""live"", not original versions. I use the quotation marks because the ""live""-ness seems to vary from one cut to the next. If that's okay with you, there some great old style funk to be had here. I'd still rather have the originals, though."
3,Tabasco Mustard,It's an ok mustard. Maybe Tabasco and mustard is not a good mix. Tabasco and mayonaise is better. That's about it.
3,Good but not Great,"Tabasco coarse ground mustard taste just like every other brand. That is not a bad thing but, it is not a good thing either. When I saw the TABASCO label I expected a coarse mustard that would make my eyes water and fill me with sweaty, Hot & FIREY goodness but alas, it did not. TABASCO needs to bring a little more to their line of condiments. When I see the TABASCO Label I automatically expect to burn calories upon contact with the bottle and nothing less than that. So I can only give 3 stars for this particular item."
5,Great stuff,"This one and the spicy mustard are wonderful. Very full flavor, think Guldman brown mustard with a little tang and heat from tobasco. The first bottle lasted about three days, I put it on everything from sammiches to chips and pop corn and strangely enough sweet apples. It doesn't have a bunch of heat but can easily rival mustards like Maile brand etc."
1,THE PARAGRAPHS ARE TOO LONG!,"Several other reviews have noted the excruciating writing style of this book, and I agree. Most pages seem to contain no more than one paragraph and the start of the next one. After a while, I could not face it. I could not finish the book. I mean, racist skinheads bashing in some Ethiopian's skull, community outrage, and all the attendant hoopla--how could that be boring? I'm sure it's an intersting story, but I'll never know."
1,The author needs to take a writing course!,"This is undoubtably the most poorly-written book I have read in years. Paragraphs go on for pages, sentences are so long they lose their point, and punctuation has very little to do with standard English. I made myself finish this book because I wanted to understand the events, but I had to force myself through the writing itself. In addition, the author seems to blame everyone for this crime except for the ones who committed it. Perhaps she is trying to defend her hometown, or--as another reviewer speculated--she fell under the spell of the skinhead propaganda. In any case, I would never recommend this book to anyone. If you want to know what happened in Portland, look up old newspaper articles. It would be easier and more enjoyable reading."
4,BATTERY PROBLEM,"Alot of features but complicated to figure out. Sweet headphones but fragile. Best part is armband, i sleep with it on. Has lock but unnecessary cause buttons are semi hard to push. I read audiobooks are bad on this but you can record the radio. Battery doesn't last 15hours! More like 4 or more albums, given you use the right charger(5volts, 500mah)."
2,Dead battery,"I had the older version (500meg) for at least 3 years. It was the only mp3 that held up to sweat from the gym. Battery life was still excellent , however I lost it a few weeks ago. I bought the 1 gig as a replacement for the one I lost. The price was great, but the battery would not charge. I sent it back at amazon for a full refund without any problems. I'm not sure if I want to try again. Great product if you get one with a good battery"
1,Internal battery won't stay charged,"I charged this thing after I first got it. It said ""battery full"" but it will not stay on for more than a minute then it dies. I have tried to recharge it numerous times and get the same result. Guess I learned my lesson about buying electronics over the internet. This thing is JUNK."
4,Durable small player,I made a purchase of this device several years ago and it was hard to find replacement parts ( the arm/wrist band ) becuase it was no longer available in stores. I even called RCA but no luck finding this model even though that hade a newer bigger Gig bite system but it too wasn't available. Amazon hade the device at a great price. I didn't want to use my cell phone for music storage.
3,"OK, I suppose","I've had this for about a year now and, like others have noted, it's having issues keeping a charge. The battery always seems to be dead when I need it. The radio works fine - in fact, it's probably the best thing I like about it - and the ability to orientate the screen to your liking is useful.However, a couple of things have put in firmly in the drawer for now. The screen is small and difficult to read. When out jogging in bright light, it's impossible. Also, I have not found a way to have the stopwatch running and be able to skip songs on the MP3 player. Coming out of the stopwatch mode to change songs or switch to a different radio station resets the stopwatch when you go back in. So make sure you like every song you put on this if using the stopwatch for long periods of time.I'm being a tad generous with 3 stars. It's probably a 2.5."
4,Great for Exercising with Music,"I love this mp3 player. I needed an alternative to my brick-sized iPod (which I still dearly love, but it's a bit large) and this tiny player fits the bill. I've only put songs on it so far, since I need music to keep some pep in my step when I'm walking for fitness.I found it very easy to use, with clear directions for installing it and uploading music to it. It's also easy to scroll through songs or change the volume when I'm out walking.And, it is very lightweight and small, so you can grab it and go. The accompanying straps are great, but I usually find carrying it no big deal, and it fits easily into my pockets.For the price, this player is an excellent deal which fits my needs nicely."
4,reasonable,"I used this item intensively for the first 6 months following purchase and then a bit more moderately for the rest of the time. I used it while conducting high impact exercise outdoors. the item was exposed to all kinds of temperature, the rays of the sun and humidity.The armband broke after about a month of usage. After about 5 months the paint started to come off. after about 8 months some of the buttons wouldn't work as well. But, I continued to use the unit for over a year. It still works, but most of the buttons don't work well...I think i subconsciously misplaced it, to justify getting the RCA S2501 with the wireless headset.I got my money's worth, with all the abuse I put it through, plus, I was ready to move on. Our relationship, RCA 2001, was good while it lasted. LOL!Not perfect, but again nothing is, everything breaks eventually, and thank goodness!!!! Cause I definitely also tire of them!"
2,Not what I expected,"This mp3 player has been a pain in the butt. It worked fine the first few times, but now the battery is always dead, and I've only used it 3 times before. It will play for a little while (1/2 hr workout) but be dead the next time I try to use it. I'm not organzied enough to charge it every time I use it. I used to have a Nike mp3 player that lasted forever, and I guess I expected this to be as reliable, as RCA is a goo brand, but I am disappointed."
3,Great for the $$,"I'm quite happy with my purchase. I'm very non-tech and RCA doesn't really offer any support so I've been having to figure this out on my own and that's time consuming, instead of just being able to 'click' for an answer.It sounds great, holds more than enough music for my 1-2 hour nightly workouts and the arm and wristband keeps my hands free and out of my way. I can't get it to shuffle and I do have the shuffle feature turned on. But like I said, RCA has nothing to offer in any way of support for this product. Also, I found out tonight that if I try to fast forward to the next song (can't figure out any other way to move to the next one) it turns the stopwatch off.All little glitches that I'm sure I can work around, I just wish RCA had a Q/A page so I could just learn how to control it faster."
2,Jet mp3 player,I had previously purchased 2 of these. Mine works fine but my husband steped on his so I purchased another one for him. This one (after 2 weeks) will not charge and now he is unable to use it at all.
3,Some troubles,"The first unit received was faulty...had to pay additional shipping back to RCA for repairs. Armband strap broke within 2 weeks.Sound quality is fine,however disappointed with armband strap and original unit."
3,Comfort,"I ordered the correct size for my height but was still a little dissappointed- I had just had cervical spine surgery and had to sit up in bed well my head wouldn't reach the pillow even with correct size pillow for 5'4""-- but hey my grandsons love it!"
1,No show!,I ordered this item just before Christmas. It is now January 28th and I still have not received it!!!!!
5,Fantastic,I love Sherlock Holmes but having to buy all the books is an admittedly daunting and wallet emptying process.Barnes and Nobles cleverly put half of Doyles Holmes stories in this volume.Not only was it cheaper but it was also convenient for people who don't want to carry around 20 books.
5,"Well Done, B&N","Well-organized book for a great price. Contains half of the entire Holmes canon.There are enough footnotes for the typical reader, but leaves a die-hard fan such as myself yearning for a little more.Intro is short and raises main analysis points only--however, if it's the stories you want, not analysis, this book is fantastic.Both volume #1 & #2 are quite large books. This is another great Barnes & Nobles classic."
3,A Romance Junkie,"It was a well written book and the characters were fine, but it was not one of my favorite books. Alex while fine and rich was kind of cold but not where his sister was concerned. I think he could have treated Saskia with a little be more trust and love. She was down to earth and just too sweet for her own good. I liked his sister and she found herself through Saskias help. I recommend it because it's not boring."
3,Nice Grill - Messy Cleanup!,"The grill and the griddle side cook evenly and perfectly every time, however cleanup is my biggest complaint! Who had the idea there should be raised ridges at the end of the grill - what is the point of it on this grill, it is not slanted like all the other grills?? All it does it trap food and make it difficult to clean - the same goes for the griddle - all the mess on the griddle has to be swept into the grill side - so even if you did not use the grill you are cleaning that! And after how many types of grills that have been sold why hasn't someone had the idea to attach the stupid drip tray to the grill? This is another product that is not worth the headache to clean! I just stick the whole thing in the sink and spray it off even though you are not suppose too - that is how much of a pain the thing is too clean!"
2,"SO-SO ,Beware","I have a personal George Foreman that I just LOVE! So when I saw this big combo,I thought I would finally be able to cook great meals for everyone in the family at the same time, instead of one at a time on the little one. Well, it didn't work out like that.Like one of the other reviewers stated the grill does not seem to want to brown anything. The griddle side is ok, but I am now wishing that I had just got the big grill with removable plates. The knobs are VERY loose and act like they want to fall off. It's huge. I mean really big. Takes up my whole counter, which makes cleaning it a hassle. I personally am not impressed with the quality of this product."
2,unimpressed,"i am unimpressed with this product. the griddle is nice, but the forman grill is unimpressive. it does not brown your food fast enough. by the time it gets around to browning your food (especially steaks) the inside of your food is overcooked! DON'T BUY,IT'S A WASTE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR COUNTERSPACE!!!!!"
3,cool,This is great if you can keep the batteries in it. They keep popping out and my boys wont even use it now.
5,Awsome album,"Samon is in the same vein of Fat Jon/Flylo in my eyes. So, if you know thier sound you'll be pretty at home with his. Can't type much but overall, I will say this album was a great experience; ""As We Come"" and ""Reflections"" are two of the best songs on here and the rest of the album is great as well. Check this out!"
4,Pretty good,Gives a nice cool light - noticeably less yellow than regular bulbs. I have used the larger globe version though and found they had a VERY short lifespan. Maybe these small ones will turn out to be better...fingers crossed...
3,Has problem with windows update site,I bought this router based on price and it works pretty well. The set up was fairly easly once I got tech support on the line to tell me it had to be set up differently with my DSL modem (Westell) but you should know that Windows Update will not work with this router. It will freeze when it tries to scan your PC. Tech support tells you they know this and to wait for firmware update but no time table given.
2,"Cheap Router, Cheap Results!","I bought this router so I can be on my computer and my PS2 online games. Some of the games can't get through Speedstream's firewall. DMZ didn't work, disable DoS didn't work, and Special Appications didn't work. So I called there 24 hour tech support...Got a recorded message. Tried Email, and it was sent back. Submit a question and you get answers that cannot be understood. ..."
4,Good AMAZINGLY cheap router,"I purchased this router because I wanted/needed a cheap NAT firewall router for my cable modem. This router has performed extremely well so far, with the exception of one firmware bug I've found (dealing with viewing the security log).The security on this product is great. The firewall doesn't let a thing through... many NAT firewall's echo UDP traffic. This one does not. It is possible to configure this router so that no one on the outside world knows that your IP address even exists :)I don't do any of the advanced things like other people posting here do, so I can't confirm or deny their complaints. That said, if you want a good NAT firewall router without spending a huge sum of money, give this one a look."
3,PS2 Problems,"This is a good cheap router, but if, like me, you purchased to be able to connect your PS2 to the world for online gaming, I would recommend another product. See, PS2 requires that certain packets of information be allowed through the firewall in order for the headset to function. Normally, you can just tell the router to allow these packets for the PS2, or you can use the DMZ host feature. However, changing this still did not allow the packets through. I talked to someone on the technical support team, and they said that they don't know what the problem is and that numerous people have had this problems. They said keep checking for a firmware update but they had no timetable for it's completion. So, if the DMZ host feature eliminates the firewall, why does the router still give me problems? The router does not apparently listen to how you set it up. Take that for what it's worth to you..."
2,you get what you pay for,"Well, I got what I paid for, a cheap router. I have a 3Mbp/s connection via Cox Cable, and with this router I was getting an average speed of 2.5 Mbp/s, without router 3.6Mbp/s. Also, the configuration script was very sparse, not too many options on what you can setup. I would far more recomend the Linksys router over this one."
1,Great potential marred by poor quality and support,"A 4 port router with print server for under 30 bucks and backed by the Siemens name? Should've been a winner but this was not the case!Basic installation went fine but many web pages had missing images. Installing the print server failed with Windows error messages. I tried the online help which suggested ""try uninstalling and re-installing"". I emailed for support; after a week and no reply I boxed it up and returned it. I'm back on my trusty Linksys router.A very dissapointing experience."
1,Not at all what I expected,"This book was not what I anticipated. I purchased it as a gift for my trivia-loving dad for Christmas hoping he could spend hours purusing through. Although he could have spent hours as the book is so large, it would have been quite boring for him, I'm afraid. It truly is a book of list after list after list of miscellaneous things. Not a sit down and enjoy reading type of book. No paragraphs or questions or chapters, only pages of lists. I was very disappointed with the lack of description on Amazon about the book from the start."
2,Did not fit!,"This item was at least 1/2 inch to long to fit over the original equipment mirror. It was also very thin making the proposition of cutting it to size likely to be unsuccessful. I would not suggest purchasing this item unless you have a way of cutting it (and not yourself,as I did twice on the unfinished edges!) to the proper size."
2,Dorman Help! 51136 Cadillac Driver Side Replacement Mirror Glass,"I agree with Mike's review. The was too big to fit over the original equipment mirror. I had to fold the two-sided tape several times to stick it over my original mirror so it would adhere. This did not make an effecient method of mounting the mirror and the mirror sags. I am currently looking for a spacer I can make to attach the Dorman mirror to the spacer and the spacer to my original mirror. If you can find a better way to attach it or have it cut to size, the mirror would be fine."
4,Very interesting!,"This is a fascinating look behind the scenes of the top 3 B-movie ""scream queens"" of the 80s. Another one of those situations that makes you think that, as you were going through it (the 80s), you don't realize that these will the good, old days!I don't understand what happened with David DeCoteau's career. He was never Orson Welles of course, but he's put out some extra stinky product of late! Who keeps giving this guy money?? 1313 Cougar Cult had all 3 of these ladies in it and was unwatchable! IMHO"
3,play the demo first to check for problems,i tried playing this demo and everything worked except the voices - the characters' scripts would cut into each other. very annoying. i've never had a problem like this with another game. then i played the still life demo and it was good and everything worked perfectly. so try this demo out for technical issues before buying.
2,Is this an adventure game?,"This is not a good game. For starters, there is a massive amount of unskippable dialogue, much of which makes no sense. You speak of characters you've never heard of leaving you scratching your head in wonder. There is also a dialogue with a character in the hotel (as stated by another review) which forces you to end task the game since there is no way to terminate the conversation. Did anyone play/test this game before it was released?In addition, there aren't many puzzles, and the larger ones are not difficult, clever, or challenging, just tedious. I don't consider ""trial and error"" a puzzle, just annoying and a waste of time.The only redeeming aspect of the game are the decent graphics. But, sorry guys, pretty pictures do not an adventure game make.After this and Cameron Files 2, another stinker, I am wary of purchasing other Dreamcatcher products. They seem more interested in pumping out mediocre games quickly than making some good ones."
2,Packaging sells,"The packaging for Post Mortem makes it look like an exciting, dark and mysterious game. Its not. Graphics for the main character are repetitive and annoying. You can't skip the dialogue no matter how long and repetitive it is and absolutely none of the witness are the least bit interesting. Simply didn't like it. Save your dough."
2,Don't waste your money,"Post Mortem left the quality control lab waaaay too soon! What were the developers thinking when they designed the dialog tree? Revealing clues in the dialogs before you're even introduced to the characters they involve... found myself going ""huh?!"" all of the time. Also, when talking to one character in the hotel, I wasn't able to terminate the conversation because I hadn't completed some obtuse task; had to ctrl+alt+del the game. There is also no way to advance conversations ala ESC or right-clicks found in other games.The background music is boring and grates on the nerves.This game lacks all that makes an adventure game an adventure game, but the pictures are real pretty."
4,Fantastic,"I bought the game few hours ago, and I can't stop playing it! It's fantastic. It has beautiful graphics, very good sounds (you'll love the music), voices are fantastic (I mean in the polish version :)). The game's got great climat... fantastic. But there's one bad thing... loading time!! It takes ages to do something. You want to view the map? Wait 15 secs. You want to go to other place on the map? Wait a minute! Horrible! But the game's worth waiting. Can't wait to finish it :)"
3,"I enjoy this game, but....","You can easily get sucked into this game for hours, but dont immediatley go out and buy this game just because i said that. The game has close to NO DEPTH. You barely ever really have to think hard about what you are doing. Mostly you go somewhere and interrogate someone, then they give you something which forces you to go somewhere else and talk to someone else. follow me? Going places is easy, you dont walk around town, immidiatly when you leave somewhere you are shown a map. You can click on an area on the map and you go there. So if you want a game that wont get you stuck up and stumped in thinking, get this game."
1,Horrible game very boring,Very boring game all you do is interview people back and forth the game is so dark its hard to see things sometimes and the accents are bad and the graphics are bad too definitely wouldn't recommend this game.
4,"Not a blockbuster, but not a dud either.","Like the title said. Not a blockbuster but not a dud either. Good graphics, nice little story. Fun especially for those who enjoy a mystery and the macabre. Voice overs are so-so, not loaded with action. But overall a good way to kill some time."
3,Not so great,"This game may have suffered b/c of its budget. It was very short (Which is characteristics of games from developer Microid), and there are many bugs in the game. The game designers try to incorporate non-linear gaming by allowing multiple paths to go through a certain part of the game. However, as a result, you may get stuck at a part of the game without any possibility to advance but to reload a saved game. Sometimes dialogues will be about things that you haven't discovered yet, so that leaves you confused about the story.The story was underdeveloped. The main character has psychic abilities, but that wasn't utilized too much in the game. Also, the inventory system is pretty bad. You have to scroll through a horizontal bar to choose an item; that gets annoying when you have like 50 items with you. The graphics also didn't look too great on my computer, but then again my video card was outdated, so that could be why."
3,A Little Disappointing,"I played this game right after Syberia which I think was part of the problem. Syberia I and II are so visually stimulating and flows into an enjoyable plot. Post Mortem was too dark, the graphics were not nearly as good as expected and the characters actions became annoying (arm and hand movements when they spoke). Granted it was creepy and kept me curious enough to keep going.I did, however, enjoy the ending."
1,post mortem,"Save your money, (even if it goes on sale) this is the worst game I have ever played. If you want to play a fun game play Longest Journey or Syberia or Dark Fall, Post Mortem is the most boring game ever and the music was lousy, interaction was awful, and the characters have no personality. The puzzles are almost non-existant. Sorry, but I wasted my money so save yours."
2,"OK story, killed by canned dialogs.","I was captivated by that game for a couple hours when I started playing, then I merely played it because as an adventure games fan, I had to finish it, and at least see the end.The atmosphere is pretty good, and the story is OK (If you're not sick of games involving the Templars). If it weren't for the canned, unskippable dialogs, I would have given this game 3 stars."
4,"A Wild Ride, Even by Flower Kings Standards","As the keyboard player of the excellent Prog band, ""The Flower Kings,"" Bodin has made his presence and style very obvious on those releases. On this solo album, Bodin takes you on a fun-house journey that's loaded with sometimes amusing, sometimes odd, sometimes fascinating and always interesting music. It's a kaleidoscope of sounds from a barrage of synths. Half the tracks are like solo pieces (such as a deep church organ solo, or a sampling experiment), and the other half are swelling prog sounds like Flower Kings. The first listen, I didn't like it much. After repeated listens, I think it's absolutely brilliant. If you like the Flower Kings or creative keyboard work, GET THIS DISC!"
4,Leather Pouch for CyberTool,"I craft leather as a hobbie and I think this is a Verry well built pouch, it fits my swiss army knife like a glove and the snap is very secure."
5,Superb but silly pricing,"This album and its companion both have engaging performances and clear sound. Both are strongly recommended for anyone who loves Bach and hasn't been overexposed to these pieces. Note that in the MP3 store, Amazon currently prices the album at $9.99. But if you buy each of the nine songs separately, the overall price is a bit lower."
1,SAVE YOUR $ MONEY $,"Talk about a COMPLETE waste of time,it makes a better paper weight then anything,I liked absolutely nothing about it,I threw it in the trash,SAVE YOUR $ FOR SOMETHING THAT REALLY WORKS!!"
2,eh,"I bought this because of all of the other reviews on here and overall it is pretty good. Strong vibrations but not the most intense. I gave it a two because I can not understand for the life of me why someone would design a vibrator with little black, POINTY eyeballs. Hold it the wrong way and well, you can guess the rest.I also would have liked the vibrator twist switch to have a little something there so it would actually click off. Put this away and if you aren't careful enough it will glide back over to the On position."
3,"Commical sex toy, not the worst","The eyes are a bit pointy and I don't believe it's water safe. It packs an alright punch, though the pink is adorable. I would actually invest in a better made remote control toy if you intend to use it more than every blue moon. It's not terrible but I wouldn't buy it again. If you're timid with sex toys that aren't cute this one is perfect."
3,Has AC/DC not put out enough albums?,"If you need more AC/DC albums in your life, ""Rules"" is the perfect disc. I like Supagroup's no-holds-barred attitude and catchy riffs. Sometimes, they cross the line from inspired to AC/DC-copying, like on ""Bastard"" or ""I'm Gonna Change"". ""Rough Edge"" proves they should keep the songs short. The lyrics are very old-school, in Supagroup's world it's like Bon Scott didn't die from partying to much."
2,c-c-c-can I get a refund?,"Pretty lame rock here, really nothing special. Like a guy said in his review, has AC/DC not put out...oh wait I cannot say that because it is not within the guidelines, my bad!Yeah, they try to be stoner rock while trying to uh, convey some hip image from days gone by. Seriously, it is not that good and you should look more towards real talent than garage band wannabes because how in the world they got signed is beyond me. Supagroup, I mean even the name is kind of ridiculous."
2,Snoozefest,"This book deals with the politicking surrounding the election of a new Pope after the death of Paul VI. I would normally be interested in something like this but I couldn't even finish half of it. The entire first half consisted of the various dialogues between pessimistic Cardinals bemoaning the state of the world, and tallying up the votes of the various blocs in the College of Cardinals. Is it fiction? Is it history? I don't know. I just know that with its obsession with the Soviet Union and liberation theology, the book is extremely dated in addition to being boring."
1,Think Twice,"Very poor fax machine especially if you're trying to fax multiple sheets. Prone to jamming, only about 1 out of three faxes go on first try. If you only fax single sheets it may be worth it. Otherwise, keep looking. I'm looking to replace this thing.On the positive side answering machine works well..."
1,dont buy this item,"1. it is cheaply made even at this low price2. It's roller mechanism is not stable, and will often 'squeeze' the pages too tightly, and then your recipients wont be able to read them. Such glitches cause delays in critical work deadlines3. Sometimes spending a bit more money in order to also buy stress-free equipment is a good thing. I am not sure which other fax machine to buy, have to do more research, but I bought this one on the recommendation of a salesperson. Mistake. Live and learn."
2,Cheap and works but at a cost.,"Everything is ok about this machine. I use it as a fax machine only. The annoying thing about this is that it uses Ink paper!The last guy's review is on the mark. It prints about 20-30 pages and then you'll have to change the ink paper. It wastes ALOT of ink paper too.If I knew, I would of bought something else."
4,Easy to setup,"I thought it was easy to setup and i havent had any problems with it, i hooked my internet line to fax machine and I never have a problem with logging onto the internet,I just unhook it when i logg off the net.this is my 1st fax machine and I Love It.Fenton,MoCheryl Noack"
1,A great disapointment considering maker's reputation,"small screen says paper jammed even when no paper shows anywhere in machine. Impossible to send any faxes or make copies. The periodic report of calls works well, and there are no jams. Rings are decently loud, but that is it!It is out of warranty, so the Panasonic people want me to pay, with credit card, before they ARE willing to answer any questions. Avoid this little machine, no matter the cost, because it is likely you will choose another make. A real disgrace for Panasonic, and I shall probably avoid any of their products except televisions."
1,Terrible,"Waste of money. All I need is a simple fax for occasional use, but with this one there are frequent ""check document"" messages, problems in both receiving and sending, and it can't send more than one page at a time. It takes several tries to send even one page, giving the ""check paper"" prompt each time. Wasteful film, too. Keep looking."
2,Not happy,We bought this fax machine for the occasional fax we need to send or receive at home. Sending seems to be fine. Receiving is a pain in the neck! The paper doesn't seem to want to feed in and faxes constantly get stuck in the memory. I have to constantly feed in one sheet at a time to receive a fax. We aren't pleased with this and are in the process of buying a new machine. Hopefully we'll be happier!
2,Okay as long as you never need to use it.,"I use the fax to send in a time sheet every other week and then every now and then when something can't be e-mailed. It has been fine to send in the time sheets but just today I was expecting a 40 page fax for my husbands job out of town and only got 12 sheets out of it because I couldn't feed the paper through the jammed fax machine fast enough. So, I had to depend on the memory and that only saved up about 12 1/2 pages. Oh, well. Lots of lost time on this one. I'll be purchasing a better fax machine and having it shipped tomorrow."
1,"If you want to throw your money away, buy this machine.","When I first got the machine I sent a 1 page fax and it worked okay, so I threw the packaging away. After that every time I send a multi-page fax The pages get stuck & go through together. I use good quality paper & fan it out, but even after multiple attempts I get the same results. Now the new thing is, even when I put the documents in one at a time, some of the pages don't get acknowledged and I get an error message. I tried calling the help line but they don't have weekend coverage. Now I'm trying to figure out if I'm better off sending it for repair, or just throwing it in the garbage where it belongs and trying again with another make and model. I really don't know if this thing is worth any more of my time. Take my advise, stay away from this machine. By the way, this machine doesn't deserve close to one star, but they don't have zero stars as an option for the rating."
5,Good Fax Machine for the Home - Office,Have had this unit for about 5 months. Have had no problems and it has all the features I need. Salesperson recommended this one over Sharp and Brother. I doubt if there is much difference between the three in this price range but I have no reason to wish I had bought a different machine. I love the integrated phone system and use it as my main phone at home. If you are looking for a fax machine in this price range I think you will find this one is a good choice.
1,"The ""copy"" quality is extremely poor",Easy to setup. But the copier quality has become extremely poor right after several uses. The copy printout is not readable. Not recommended.
1,Worst Fax Machine Ever Used!!!,"This machine is horrible. I have had only two successful transfers with this machine that were legible and they were on the day I bought the machine. The rolling mechanism used to scan documents is terrible, jams all the time. I have had plenty of complaints about people receiving my faxes and saying they can't read a thing. The quality is very very very low on received and sent faxes. I would not recommend anyone to buy this machine."
1,Not recommended,"I originally wrote a review on this item nearly a year ago, giving it an excellent review. However, since then I have drastically downgraded it to a 1 rating. Initially, the machine worked flawlessly; however, it has NOT held up. I started using it more for my business, and the pages kept getting stuck, causing me to re-fax documents pape-by-page. The machine is wasteful using the thermal ink paper, which is expensive. This is the last time I will purchase Panasonic."
3,"Good Characters, Intriguing Art, slow start =(","I was looking forward to this book. The main character is just what I was looking for. However his adventure is slowed by a complicated story that didn't seem to be going anywhere anytime soon. I have to admit I didnt get very far into this book, 30 pages maybe, but thats the problem, it quickly made it's way to the bottom of my pile for sheer lack of interest. However I gave it a 3 to be fair, for the story is only half of a graphic novel and the artwork has a very nice style and is original. The drawings are not just well done but creative in that futuristic cars etc. never looked quite like this elsewhere, and the way the artist separates the shading really works for the book. Too bad the story didn't work for me, maybe some day I'll pick it up again and add something to this."
3,Newhart does the old chestnuts,"First of all, let me say that it's great to have Newhart's old standup routines memorialized for the ages on this video. All the old chestnuts are here: the Driving Instructor, Abe Lincoln, Tobacco and others. The downside is that Newhart doesn't do a particularly good job of delivering the material. It seems as if his timing is off and often some important and funny lines are omitted. Having said that, if this is all we can get to watch, it's still worth watching. But if you want Newhart at his best, get the original audio performances, available on CD."
3,Bob Newhart The King Of Dry Humor and Comedy,"I think that the the Button Down Concert (DVD)is a Newhart Masterpiece.No matter how often I watch it, I never get tired of the King of Dry's humor.I would recommend this DVD for the ultimate in Stand up Comedy routines.Newhart also has a wide selection of other DVD's and C.D.'s which I have purchased from Amazon.Anyone who has a sense of humor would enjoy getting this DVD for a Birthday,or Christmas gift, as well as for your own personal video library."
5,A Bob Newhart fan Must Have,Love this DVD - loved Bob's TV shows but love him more as a stand-up comedian. Brought back many good memories of Bob when he started out. Enjoyed showing this to my children who only know of Bob from his TV series and they also enjoyed his humor and style of delivery that is so unique.
4,Bob Newhart - Button Down Concert DVD,Great DVD for those who have seen Bob Newhart or are still waiting for the opportunity. The routines may be vintage but they are as funny as ever. I just wished it was longer.
3,Love 'em but not the same...,"I have always loved Bob Newhart's dry humor and clever use of the one-sided conversation, but, having seen him live within the past couple of years may have set an expectation too high because this recent on-stage performance lacks the kick you get out of his in-person warm and fuzzy ""charisma."" Good to watch if you've never been exposed, yet more one dimensional than the original audio-only LP."
3,The Button Down mind,"Good video, except for the fact that most of us Newhart fans have heard his classic stand up themes(The Ape, Driving Instructor etc.)The only thing different is that now its a video..."
4,Pretty good stuff,"Softer than other dried meat I've tried, these nuggets are easier on the teeth and jaw. And very flavorful. Would buy again. A++!"
3,Best beef jerky high in salt,"been buying this product for over a year now, I use to buy oberto beef jerky but found that jack links is very tender and wont break any of my teeth while trying to eat it. this has to be one of the most tender meat in any beef jerky brand I have had since I can actually chew it without my jaw starting to hurt.. the other problem is limitation, this product is very addicting, I can eat a whole bag myself and want more, this has a lot of sodium so it can be pretty unhealthy if you have problems like myself limiting yourself to a few peices... the price is a few dollars cheaper then in the stores and this is also a little bigger bag, so you are getting a good deal if you plan on buying these in bulk."
2,Beware.,"I love Jack Links, but was disappointed that out of six bags, one was spoiled; perhaps the seal was broken and I did not realize it.It comes with a handy clip strip for retail hanging but I am glad I had not taken these to the flea market with me because someone could have fallen ill if they had eaten the bad pouch.Not sure if I will order this product online again, you might want to try a warehouse club instead, for your concession stand."
1,Oof!,"This may be the most inaccesible management book I've ever read. I picked it because of Shewart's exalted position in the quality movement - as the mentor and intellectual guide to Deming, he is the theorist behind the quality of our cars, VCRs and televisions.Unfortunately, his writing is enormously hard to read and apply. The mathematics were very hard to penetrate - dozens of pages to even get to basing control charts on standard deviations. I've got a minor in mathematics, so I was suprised by the difficulty. It was near impossible to derive quality lessons from the book.In deference to the author, I'll make a lot of excuses for him:- It was written a long time ago.- The book was aimed at statisticians, not managers.- A compilation of Shewart's ideas would be more effective than lecture notes.My end recommendation - browse before you buy."
2,Not for the non statistician,"I picked up this book because I've been recently delving into the works of W. Edward Deming. I find it incredible that his works aren't taught in school, but I also as a previous reviewer has stated, this book is not for the statistical beginner or even intermediate. I do have a college degree and consider myself intelligent and stronger than average in math, but this is not an easy book to understand."
4,Genius can be hard work,"A Classic of its time, many managers today are not aware of the genius of Shewhart. In fact Deming himself attributes most of his ideas to Shewhart. There are many Management Gurus today who pay scant regard to the contributions of Shewhart and pass off their work as original but on closer examination you will find the mind of Shewhart once you remove the modern spin.Excellent method and logical thinking. Its worth persisting with the old fashioned language to get the true voice of the genius.Its about time this man received the recognition he deserves."
3,Was expecting more.,Wanted the book to be a reference to Shewhart's Economc Control of Quality of Manufactured Prodct. Haven't worked with either book yet. May appreciate it more in the future.
2,"Great concept, Doesn't live up to expectations!","Item arrived quickly and I ran the toaster a couple of times as recommended in the instructions. OK, so far so good. Put in bread, it took 3 cycles on the full setting to get toast. Tried the egg cooker, that worked fine. 4 slice toaster is what I want.Never mind. Sending it back."
2,I should have listened to my wife and daughter...,"who told me that this item is silly.I only tried this once and returned it. The toast wellness knob is backwards, so the darkest setting is where the lightest setting is on most toasters. Not something that you would think to study carefully.And making the eggs in this is more trouble than using a regular pan on the stove. There are a lot of little plastic parts to clean, you have to spray it with Pam (who's butter flavor, I discovered, taste pretty gross)and the entire process is not all that simple. And the eggs had a weird consistancy.Yes, I'll listen to them the next time... maybe."
1,broke after first use,we got this toaster and i was really excited about it and we tried it and it didnt even finish the first thing we put in it before it shorted out and broke.... it also smells really bad..... this toaster is garbage do not buy.
2,I really wanted to like this,"I was excited about this, as we love breakfast sandwiches, but decided to return it.Biggest issue is it's not a good toaster. It's too slow and dries out the bread before it gets brown. Probably something with trying to time the toast with the eggs but does the same thing whether cooking eggs or not.Second issue the egg cups wouldn't sit level so the yolk slid over to one side and we couldn't keep it anywhere near the center of the egg. Maybe a little picky, but when you want them soft to medium and still eat it as a sandwich, you gotta have the yolk in the middle.Finally, we couldn't get it to cook eggs or toast either one consistently with the same setting/amount of water. Toast either over cooked (and really dry in the middle) or not even browned. Eggs either too hard or still runny whites. Maybe operator error, but we couldn't make it consistently cook."
4,fun gadget but out of stock,"The company contacted me stating they no longer make the 4 slot, 2 egg version. I was able to purchase the 2 slot, 1 egg version. After reading the reviews, I was a little worried about purchasing the product. But, it works just fine and the sandwiches taste great! My husband prefers more than one egg, so the double version would have been more convenient. I've been using egg beaters instead of real eggs. I add enough water as if I am hard boiling one egg, and it comes out as a perfectly scrambled egg. I cook two slices of canadian bacon on the grill part for warming meat."
2,Does not heat evenly.,"I've had this toaster for a year and a half now. This toaster does not heat anything evenly. A piece of toast will not only be more toasted on one side, but also top and bottom will not be the same.Also, consecutive toastings will get darker and darker, even if you alternate the 2 right slots and the 2 left slots.I give it 2 stars because it does what it is suppose to, it just doesn't do a good job of it."
4,Nice toaster but not perfect,"This toaster works reasonably well, and you can't beat the convenience for cooking eggs & sausage while toasting, but I will list a couple painful points I encountered.The non-stick coating on the egg pans is thin and started flaking within a year. New pans are available for $5 each plus $8 shipping.The metal tray where the water goes gets very dirty if you cook sausage and it is not removable, so it is a bit of a pain to clean and needs cleaning frequently. It would be much more convenient if this piece was removable.Some people have also mentioned that the egg pans don't sit level, and if you like your eggs runny this can be a problem. This is true, but you can gently bend the handle of the pans to adjust how they sit with some success.Lastly, I've felt the highest setting could've been longer, bagels often need a second time through to really be toasted. But for most other breads it toasts just fine."
3,Caution!Caution!Caution!,"This is such a cool concept and it makes mornings sooo much easier. HOWEVER like many of the other reviews have said...1.) the left side of the toaster doesn't work and 2.) it does have a weird mechanical like smell, but it's not bad enough that you can't eat your food. I haven't tried to exchange or send back this product b/c I don't want to have to pay for shipping etc. (the right side works) and I haven't contacted amazon or the sender about it. I would suggest buying it from a local store if you can find it, in case you have the same problem, which is seems as though it's possible!!"
5,I LOVE this toaster!!,"Ever since I bought this, my husband and I have been eating breakfast sandwiches like crazy. It does such a great job and it is so nice that this does everything at once. I'm extremely happy with this purchase - well worth the money!!"
2,"ehhh,,,, only works ok and not for long","Frankly there is nothing ""handy"" about this to start with. it is not built well either, and if you love your toasted bagel the same every morning,..don't expect this toaster to do it.honestly not worth the aggravations"
5,Fantastic!,"You can do it all with this toaster. It makes great egg/cheese breakfast sandwiches too. It's also very easy to clean and a convenient way to cook breakfast. Even though the egg cups are non-stick, I still use cooking spray, which makes it much easier. Cooking breakfast for one or two has never been easier, and saves on all the kitchen mess! Highly recommend!"
3,Does the job farly well.,"Was excited to get this to try and see if the egg and english muffin was hot all at the same time. The first egg sandwich was delicious and hot all at the same time. Had issues with the second one as the toast never popped up. Had to run another cycle and the toast was too dark. Time will tell if it continues to have issues, but barring the one sandwich, this toaster delivers what it says it will. Yummy!!!"
1,Didn't work,"Nice idea, but the egg cooker didn't work. Would turn on for a few seconds, then shut off. Tried on multiple outlets at multiple homes, so it must have been a defective machine. Returned for a refund."
1,Knobs and controls stop working after a couple months of light use.,"I bought this toaster/egg poacher a few months ago. It worked decently at first. I travel during the week and usually only use it on the weekends. Figure about 2 eggs and 2 bagels every other week for 6 months. I am not really taxing the machine (or shouldn't be). Now, one of the toast setting knobs does not affect how the toast comes out. I guess this would only be frustrating if I wanted to cook toast at different settings. The ""bagel"" setting no longer works and the ""egg only"" setting no longer works. In order to poach eggs, I have to press the ""toast and egg"" button, even if I have no toast.I initially really liked this product (tho the ""meat warming tray"" is about worthless. Now I am frustrated and feel like I got ripped off. I live by myself and it broke in 6 months. I am sure someone with multiple uses would break it sooner."
1,junk,Seems like a good idea. I have had two of these and both have failed in less than a year. First just egg tray would not heat. Second appliance will not heat egg or toast. Do not buy one.
5,Best Toaster Ever,"I actually saw this presented on TV's ""I Want That"". And when I saw it, I said ""I want that"". I read your reviews and was convinced that I have to buy it. I read some reviews that said that they had experienced teflon chipping. Since I have only had this toaster less than a month, it is probably too soon to say whether that is going to happen or not. The biggest surprise was how the toast & eggs were done at the same time. I assumed that the toast or english muffin would pop up first and wait for the egg to finish. They have it so that if the toast/english muffin is done first, that it will revert to a hold & warm position and wait for the egg to finish. When the egg is done, the toast/english muffin pops up and the egg cooker turns off all at the same time. My whole family has used this and loves it."
2,Ours Didn't Work Either,"On our four slot toaster the two left slots are window dressing and don't cook a thing but only give the bread a little ride. The eggs come out great but, as others have said, the two slots that do work dry everything out. I tend to like things on the crunchy side but it's beyond crunchy and more like the texture of left over sandwich bread you'd find in your car months after your children left it uneaten there. Not that I've eaten in mind you - just the stiff, crumbly, rock like feel. I gave it 2 stars because I also purchased this for my sister and she loves hers. Based on the ""love it"" vs. ""hate it"" reviews I can only assume they have some serious quality control issues. I feel like Eeyore saying it, but if there's any kind of lemon electronic, we'll end up with it at our house. This one's going back and I'm too afraid to replace it with another. Too bad. Back to the 2 dollar microwave plastic egg poacher that works just fine."
1,Delivered broken,"Egg warmer does not turn on. Need to return, but I tossed out packaging. Toaster does not reach very high temperature so I have to toast twice."
1,FIRE HAZARD!!!,"I bought the Back to Basics TEM4500 4-Slot Egg-and-Muffin Toaster here on Amazon and initially loved it. Unfortunately after a while it started staying hot to the touch even when it's not in use. I connected a Killawatt to it and in only it is consuming .15kWh of electricity every 24 hours while being completely off.I used a laser thermometer to test the surface and it's 103.2 degrees on the egg cooker's metal plate. It is out of warranty now but clearly a manufacturer's defect, I contacted them but haven't heard back yet. A toaster most definitely should not do this. I'm lucky I didn't burn my house down."
5,great machine!!!!!,"it looked huge when it arrived, we thought it is too big, too complicated to use, but it turned out to be a very good item for the kitchen! easy to use- just break the eggs, press the button eggs and in a moment poached eggs are ready! the toaster provides different opportunities - usual toasts or one side bagel! and everything can be done at the same time!"
5,Husband's Dream Breakfast,I got this for my husband for Christmas as he loves filling breakfasts. He absolutely LOVES this toaster and still talks about my great purchase!!! It def tastes better than just toasting and frying an egg.
4,Back to Basics Toaster & egg cooker,This is the 3rd time we have purchased this same type of toaster so -obviously we like it. The first 2 were the 1 egg cooker type. The last one cooks 2 eggs at a time and 4 pieces of toast. They do not last very long . We are hopeful that this one will last longer. Hang on to your receipt.Back to Basics TEM4500 4-Slot Egg-and-Muffin Toaster
1,Good but...,"I bought this to replace my old one egg & muffin maker after it wore out. My primary issue is one of the toasters constantly pops to early and I have to retoast that size which. In addition, the lever does not like to stay down in the toasting position. I consider both reasons to mean this product is defective. I would return and exchange the toaster but I don't have the time to deal with the aggravation. On the plus side, it's nice to be able to create two muffins at the same time."
1,Not so much,"I've used this several times and plan on giving it away. What a mess! It's so much easier to get ONE pan out and you're done! All the little parts to clean and it reallly wasn't that great. The eggs take longer than the muffin. Going back to just a good ol' toaster! Besides, this is huge on the counter!"
1,Don't buy it if you are not from the States,"I will not give this product any stars because I haven't tried it out (only 1 because it's mandatory).The main problem is that the adapter needed to convert the EU electricity (220 V) to US electricity (120 V) ""is more expensive that the toaster itself"" and it would generates a lot of heat due to it's big size (experts told me, and mentioned that the price would be about 450 USD).I first noted this after buying it and receiving it (the product was sent really fast from Amazon though).So I will only let other people know of my mistake so they don't do the same :(p.s.: I wish they made a toaster like this for the EU"
1,JUNK ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Who will replace it?,Used the item 6 times and one side of the toaster pops the circuit breaker. . . . 4 months old now im stuck with it!!! Amozon wont take it back now what? ? ? ? ? ?
4,Love this toaster/egg/muffin cooker!,"The Back to Basics 4 slot Egg-and-Muffin Toaster really delivers. It takes a little practice getting the eggs just right, and I miss buttering my toast before toasting like you can in a toaster oven, but have been using it and enjoying the results."
4,Sunny Side Up,Had the single version of this toaster till it died. And replaced it with this one. The toast settings on the unit I received could be longer it seems we're always toasting it twice. Other than that it's great for a quick breakfast sandwich with out all the mess.
1,Back to Basics Egg-and-Muffin Toaster,I'm not sure what all the great reviews are about. I followed the instruction per the manual and the eggs weren't cooked. I added more water and cooked more and they still were not completely cooked for a sandwich. Also had trouble removing the egg from the egg holder using non-stick spray. I should've just stuck to a normal toaster. Large footprint was another negative. Boxed up and sent back.
4,good product with a company that stands behind it,The first time we used the egg cooker it worked great. the second time it wouldn't work at all. I contacted the company and they replaced the entire cooker with no problem. It has worked fine since.
2,Not so good,"I got this toaster as a gift last December. I have three kids, and we eat toast or waffles several times a week. After about 3 months, the toast was extreamly uneven. One of the elements went completly out after 6 months and within 8 months only one slot works. I do love the egg poacher, but the toaster is junk."
5,Awesome,"Love the product, works like a champ and produces perfect meal everytime. I cant think of anything that I would change on it, easy to use and is super versatile."
5,Awesome!,Love this toaster. I was afraid that since the company was called Back to Basics that it would be a generic brand. Not so! It is a very high quality toaster that works very well and is very easy to use.
4,Terrific Poached eggs,"Great product but not too practical for me. It bigger than I realized; a bit too big for my counter space. Unfortunately, the toaster part trips my circuit breaker ever time I use it. Think I'll get the smaller one next time & give this one to my son. It does make great poached eggs & is big enough to fit english muffins in so my grandson can have egg muffin breakfasts whenever he wants!"
1,lop sided toast,"After six months of trying every adjustment imaginable we've given up. This sucker poaches eggs well enough, but is incapable of toasting both sides of a piece of bread, no matter what slot the bread is in or what heat setting is used.Save your money unless you just want poached eggs."
5,Great Product.,This Back to Basics Slot egg and Muffin Toaster is wonderful..It makes breakfast fast and easy. It is simple to use and time efficient. The seller sent this product quickly and it was everything described in the ad. I am very satisfied with this product
2,Update Best toaster ever,"Update, this toaster at first was amazing but after using it about 40 times one side of the toast slots does not work all the time. Sometimes its on others its off must be shorted out. I would not reccomend this toaster due to the early failure.If this was a car it would be a luxury car! This toaster is great, eggs are poached and hard cooked in no time at all. Toast is toasted and it is the first toaster I have ever been excited about!"
3,Hard to Use,Requires too many adjustments to settings to get the full value of the product. Egg cooker is not the best idea.
1,Toaster combo,I was not really that pleased with the item and will be returning it. The eggs were nearly impossible to get out and the clean- up of the little egg pans was a pain in the A. I used it one time and after all the hassle felt I could have had a quicker and better breakfast sandwich by throwing a pan up on the stove and dropping a muffin in the toaster
2,Works great . . . for 4 months!,"Bought this for quick egg breakfasts for my hubby 4 months ago. It worked great at first, then about 2 1/2 months into it, I noticed one side of the toast that came out of 2 of the 4 slots was not toasted AT ALL! Then about a month later the remaining 2 slots were also not toasting one side the bread. What good is a toaster that can ""do it all"" if it can't even toast a piece of bread? The boiling (which is essentially steaming) feature worked great, as well as poaching. Warming pre-cooked meat was also good. If the eggs are done before the bread, the bread just stays down but isn't cooking anymore while the eggs finish cooking. Sounds great, but when the eggs are done the bread is not anywhere close to hot enough to melt a slice of cheese. Not enjoyable. Cool idea, but just doesn't have he guts to pull it off the right way or for any lengthy amount of time."
2,Piece of Crap,"I was very disappointed after the many positive reviews on Amazon.I will admit the egg poacher feature on this is cool, however there is no buzzer or indication of when the egg is actually done and if you open the steamer too early you can get a steam burn.What is really crappy is the toaster part of it. The darkness controls seem to do almost nothing, the left side barely toasts while the right side burns toast, and even within one slot it toasts unevenly.I am returning this item and going to buy a quality toaster and separate electric egg poacher."
5,Most used kitchen appliance,"I am a kitchen gadget queen and my family will tell you that I have every kitchen gadget under the sun. This toaster is one of the best and most used appliances in our kitchen. We absolutely love it. It makes the best breakfast sandwiches ever. We have fast food right at home. No need to go out and wonder about the quality of food that you are eating any longer at one of those fast food breakfast places. By the way, we had the 2-slice toaster to start with. We wore it out after two years and it was a must to replace it but I have to tell you that now I'm glad it stopped working, we love this 4-slice one so much better. It works great just as the 2-slice one did but now we can do two sandwiches at a time. This is one gadget that our kitchen will not be without. Worth every penney!"
3,"Fine, if you think $60 is worth it for 6 months of this product, because it will break after that","I saw the earlier reviews about how this toaster/egg poacher breaks a few months after purchase. Same thing happened to me. It worked great the first couple of months, but after about 40 uses the toaster completely stopped working. I kept it for another few months to just hard boil eggs without having to clean a pot....but, it took up so much counter space I ended up tossing it. I guess it was worth the price for the short amount of time....but, I wouldn't buy it again."
4,Eggs + toast,"The product performs quite well. It can be a little awkward in some circumstances, but does its job quite well."
2,Please don't waste your money!,"I am giving it 2 stars, since the one I bought last year lasted 8 months. I just purchased another one to replace it, when it finally stopped working. After about 3 months, it was taking longer and longer to cook the eggs. The new one was bad from day one, only half of the toaster worked. The idea of this appliance is great, but if you are looking for something to work for more than a few months (with minimal use) then look elsewhere."
5,Fantastic,I love egg mcmuffins but they take time to do them at home and they are expensive for what yuou get.THIS MACHINE IS DA BOMB!I dont write many reviews on products but this one deserves one. I did a taste test next to Micky D's with a friend of mine and he picked the one I made.The best part is that they cost maybe twenty-five cents to make. Get this thing you cant miss breakfast sandwiches 24/7. Oh it makes great toast also. Caution: dont put cheese in the steamer
4,A Great Appliance for Poached Eggs Addicts,"While slightly large, this is one appliance I don't mind sitting on my counter. I use it nearly everyday and love how it cooks perfectly poached eggs and toasts bread with ease. It also has frozen bread and bagel settings in addition to the ability to cook scrambled eggs and heat up pre-cooked meat. I would have given it a four, but the toast is slightly cooled by the time the eggs cook. Usually I just pull the toast out after the toaster turns off and before the eggs are finished (the toast won't officially pop up until after the eggs are done, theoretically keeping the toast warm), and use the extra time to butter the toast. If you love eggs and toast, I highly recommend this appliance!"
4,As advertised,"I've had this toaster for a few weeks now and have been pleased with the results. Eggs are perfectly cooked every time and turn out just right according to how much water you put in. Makes a very delicious breakfast sandwich or Eggs Benedict with very little work.Two minor cons are that sometimes the eggs overflow their holders a little bit and you have to scrub the metal boiler plate. This isn't a big deal but if you don't stay on top of it, it would get harder and harder to clean. Also, as other reviews has mentioned, the toast & egg setting tends to leave the toast a little less toasted than I like. I usually throw it down for 20 seconds or so after it's finished just to toast the toast a little more. The bagel setting only toasts one side which is nice, but even on the highest setting i find it still needs a bit longer.All in all, very happy with product and would recommend."
3,Great eggs but toaster didn't work,"The eggs came out great! Unfortunately, 2 of the 4 toasting slots didn't work. Also, the bagel setting is supposed to only toast the one side of the bagel. That didn't seem to work either. Perhaps it's tied into the other issue? Anyway, I called the manufacturer and they are sending me a replacement and I don't even need to return the original one. Very simple. No real questions asked though which makes me wonder if they are used to seeing this..."
4,Favorite kitchen item!,"I bought this toaster after realizing my addiction to egg sandwiches at local fast food joints was getting out of hand. I am in love with this item! You can cook eggs a number of different ways -hard boiled, scrambled, over easy, warm breakfast meat such as ham, and toast your bagel all at the same time. It won't even pop up the toast or whatever until the eggs are done, leaving you with the perfect sandwich! I use this item almost daily so far. It's nice with the 4 slots as I can make toaster pastries on one side for the kids, and my egg sandwiches on the other.-ETA After having this item for awhile now, I've noticed that one side consistently burns my toast, even on the lowest setting. I have had this item now for two years and have used it quite a bit (2-3xweek) so it has probably seen it's life but I would have hoped it would have lasted longer. Just something to consider as this could be a defect as it started about 1 year in."
1,The toaster that doesn't,"The 'basic' part of this appliance should be that it toasts.The first time I used it I thought ""Wow! This is fast"". Well, that's because it hadn't toasted the bread.No matter how how dark a setting I use, one time doesn't do it, Twice and sometimes 3 times is required to get more than soft warm bread.The darkness selection knob is useless. I was ready to keep it as a toaster even if the egg poacher part didn't work well (which I haven't bothered trying) but it's ready for return."
5,Healthy breakfast made easy!,"I bought this toaster for my son because I have the two slice, one egg model myself and when he's home he uses it and loves it. He is always traveling with his job and I wanted hime to have a healthy, quick and easy breakfast and this fits the bill perfectly."
2,Broke after 60 days,"Worked well for the 2 months after I got it. On the day after the Amazon returns policy expired on it, it broke. Doesn't toast, doesn't poach. Just takes up counter space. Waste of money. Relatives had same thing happen on their unit too, only it took about 9 months for theirs to break.Decent concept, BAD EGGSECUTION (bad pun too)."
4,Great Product and Time Saver,As other reviewers have mentioned this is really a useful multi-tasker in the kitchen. My wife and I use it every single morning. The only downside is that the teflon coated egg trays wear out after about 6 months of hard use. I am not complaining here its more a fact. The problem is that you can only order extras from the manufacturer as we were unable to find them online. No biggy. Overall I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a quick and cheap breakfast solution.
2,Did not work consistently..returned item,"purchased this four slot toaster/egg cooker after having used the two slot toaster/egg cooker. The first appliance worked as an egg/meat/toaster sandwich cooker for a long while...The egg cooking part of the appliance stopped working but the toaster still is operational..We decided to purchase the larger four slot unit..The eggs/toast,meat did not cook uniformly at all. Most of the time the eggs did not cook but the toast was done and dry...We returned the unit..Good idea and design but not functional.."
3,Nice Kitchen Gadget,"I like the egg cooking feature with this toaster. I am able to get an egg sandwich in the morning, even with egg beaters.The toaster part is not that great. It can take up to two cycles to get something toasted well."
2,"Functions great, but poor quality","Heard about this product from my sister-in-law and how she raved about it. The first product I received did not work right. On the toaster side: 2 of them only toasted one side of the bread while the other 2 burned the bread. The eggs cooked perfectly though. I exchanged the item and Amazon was fast in replacing it. I got the replacement and after the second use, one of the handles (where you put the meat in) broke off!! Although it was poorly made I decided to keep it because it does the job perfectly. I just didn't want to go through all the trouble again of shipping it back. They need to manufacture this product with better quality materials because it does make the perfect egg muffins and boiled eggs!!"
5,Beautiful!,Thich is a beautiful human being and it comes through in his writing. This book is not just fluff. It's useful in all areas of life. Will be read and re-read many times.
2,Like a recipe book with some ingredients missing,First off I must be honest and tell you all I am not a seasoned user of Lightwave. I am struggling through the process of learning it now. But I feel I must warn begginers to Lightwave 6 that this is probably not the book for them. It starts off quite nicely with all the basics of Modeler and Layout then starts getting into the nitty gritty of making some models. This seems to be where the book falls short. It is like a recipe book with some of the ingredients left out. Most of the time very frustrating. If you are familar with Lightwave to begin with this would probably be a wonderful book. But for a beginer like myself it has been nothing short of total frustration.
5,Wonderful book!,"The book is both straight forward and easy to understand, (I've already learned better habits and methods within the first three chapters alone). The author does recommend reading the standard manuals provided by Newtek first, Since the book is not a ""rehash"" of the manuals, but takes on a 'let's get down to business and show you how to become productive' attitude.After doing the basic tutorials in the Newtek manuals, I felt that I still needed more instruction. Although it good to learn the software by doing alot of experimentation, I feel this book will help foster the proper habits of using the application, habits already learned by skilled lightwavers.Thanks Dan, and I do look forward to your upcoming book for expert users!"
4,El mejor libro para infografistas,"Sin lugar a dudas el libro base para enterder el diseño dela nueva interfase para L.W. 6.0 es este. Dan Ablan penso bastante bien como meterse en la mente del infografista y llevarnos a conocer las bases y los trucos de L.W. 6. Es mas que obvio reconocer las grandes diferencias entre las versiones anteriores, pero principalmente el libro se enfoca en darnos pistas para que generemos nuevos diseños basados en la idea base de lo aplicado en cada capitulo. OJO este no es un recetario donde solo usaremoslos ejercicios para copiar nuevas ideas,este libro en verdad da pie para ampliar nuestras perspectivas de diseño y empezar a ganar dinero de lo que inventemos."
2,It was alright..........I guess..........,"I think that the japanese version was better than the english version of this tape. If you are a kid younger than 10 or a parent interested in buying this movie for a kid younger than ten, i think you should get this version. But if you are older than that, u should get the japanese tape."
4,A nice little video for your collection!,"This is a great video. Although it may not be the greatest, I'd certainly give it 4 stars!"
4,1 and 2,1. Do NOT listen to Rebbecas really rude review about the voices. It's a part of growing up. You get zits and voice changes. Listen to this Rebbeca: I don't even know you. But I like Sailor Mini Moon also a Million people do!2. I gave it two stars for Sailor Mini Moon. And 1 star for the show.
1,Stay away....,"I picked up a pair of these because the price was right for what looked to be a decent pair of noise-canceling headphones. Unfortunately, they went back the next day. The sound was completely muddy...all bass with hardly any treble response at all. I tried them on several kinds of music (rock, jazz, classical) with the same results across the board. They were comfortable, but completely unlistenable."
5,Family Fun Games Collection,"My kids (4 year old twins) are completely enthralled with the mini-golf game. The animation is teriffic, and while it's challenging enough to amuse an older audience, it is also user-friendly enough for young children to thoroughly enjoy. This game alone makes the purchase price of the collection worth it!"
1,A Disgrace To the Nazgul,"Attention fellow Wraiths! Do not let this foul impersonation of a Nazgul destroy their reputation!Ring Wraiths are powerful warriors and this costume makes them looks like total whimps! The hood should have been further back so you couldn't see the mesh that you breath through. Also, where the heck is the sword?! How are you supposed to conquer Middle Earth without a sword?! So to all of my fellow Wraiths, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Couples were not attractive,I know that the body changes as we age. I am 55 years old. But these couples are not attractive. And the threesome massage scene was something I found objectionable.
1,I wasted my money,The contact was not worth the money. VERY limited subject information. Very few ideas and or suggestions.Worthless! I was anticipating more topics to be discussed. The chit chat in the beginning of each segment was not needed.It was very similiar in each segment.
5,Heaven - and in a computer game!,"Monkey Island... a series thought by many to be one of the greatest in adventure gaming history.They're right, you know.The Monkey Island series follow the adventures of young Guybrush Threepwood, an aspiring pirate in the Tri-Island Area governed by Elaine Marley. During the course of his adventures, Guybrush meets Elaine and they fall in love... and he also meets the ominous Ghost/Zombie/Demon (he's different in all three games) Pirate LeChuck. LeChuck has the hots for Elaine, and a few of the games center on his quests to make her his. Guybrush and LeChuck are arch-rivals in each game.While many I know have complained about the dated graphics of some of these games, most are willing to look past that to see a brilliant, witty, and fall-out-of-your-seat-laughing game. If you are not a believer, you will be soon - I know that I am."
2,leaps of logic,Most of the puzzle solutions were out of the blue. There were no hints what so ever at what needed to be done.
3,very plasticy,"i thought this item would be much nicer than it is. it still works. ice tongs fit entirely in the lid sideways. lid and handle are both bright chrome. ""made in japan"" or china logo printed on the side irremovable... not attractive.keeps ice cold though"
1,"VERY, VERY BAD INDEED!","It sure sounded like a good enough concept. There are not enough modern RPGs in the first place so, when I stumbled upon it in the sales-bin in my local supermarket, I decided to give it a try.Turns out it was not worth the 10 bucks. Clumsy character control, extremely small areas, too many bugs and dead regions (ie: when exiting an area the respective icon does appear but nothings happens until you find the precise and narrow point of exiting).Uninstalled it in 2 hours. Try ARCANUM instead."
5,"Spinning around, move out of her way!!","This song is better than ""Cant get you out of my head"" only because its got an incredibly 70's feel to it that brings back fond memories of the PWL days. From 1988 to 1994 Kylie ruled the charts and dance floors. After ""Impossible Princess"" this was a breath of fresh air for the HI-NRG fans. The dance floors were packed with Kylie fans again.. The remixes are fun, and the video makes you wanna get up and dance along! Thank you Paula Abdul for writing it and convincing Kylie to record it!!"
2,The ending cancels any worthy advice,"The fact that Ruth Graham is in the midst of a 3rd divorce as she is writing the book shows that there is a serious disconnect between what she says she believes and how she actually lives. What good has all her Bible Study done? All she can say is God has been there to pick up her pieces. It appears she takes the grace of God as a liscense to sin. Harsh words? Yes,but in making herself vulnerable she shows she has a lot to learn and is in no position to give advice."
5,"Heart Rending, but GREAT!",This book is super for anyone needing encouragement. It was shipped immediately & received in excellent condition. I highly recommend this book!
3,A Little Disappointing...,"As I started to read this book I thought it was going to be a great book. I related to many of her emotions, thought patterns, and so forth. Although I hadn't been through the same types of life experiences. I appreciate her foundational principles she offers of Bible study, prayer, praise and worship, and journaling. However, I was a little disappointed in the outcome of some of her and her family's struggles towards the end of the book. (At the time of publishing she was undergoing a 3rd divorce.) Her advice to help those who care is good but don't rely on her experiences to help you in your own struggles or to encourage you, unless you share her patterns."
4,Australia's pride,"Cold Chisel is a must listen. Khe Sahn is perhaps the most recognised song after waltzing matilda in Australia and people of all generations know and sing the words. Cold Chisel's music is a form of hard rock. It is fun, thought provoking and great for parties.Each of the songs on this CD are equal in ability and it is an albumn that is enjoyed for it's entirity not one or two songs."
1,"this is the same cd as profound sounds, vol. 3","i love josh wink and i loved profound sounds # 3, however i don't like paying for a different cd which has EXACTLY THE SAME tracklist as a previous one. thats pretty sneaky not to show the tracklist to consumers before they buy it..."
1,Brighton Beach Memoirs,"Tape broke the first time I used it. Was to old and didn't work correctly. Wasted money, and wasn't pleased. Needed Brighton Beach for a school project and then had to regroup. My fault for not saving the packing list and sending it back, but I had high hopes for this tape and really needed it."
2,"written to entertain, not to help readers to win souls for Christ","This book is about stories of people who left the Mormon cult, some famous in counter-cult circles (like the Tanners and Thelma Geer) and some not famous, and their reasons for doing so. The first part is about their personal testimonies, and the second deals with factors involved in leaving the cult, such as personal costs and opposition from Mormon relatives and friends.This really could have been a very interesting book, but the final product did not live up to my expectations.Somebody might find these stories entertaining, but if you want to learn more about Mormon theology, history, or how to effectively witness to them, this book is of no value."
3,a bit lacking in detail,Her other books are better I would start with the other ones first. This one is a bit short on detail.
