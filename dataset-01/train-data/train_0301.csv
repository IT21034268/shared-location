1,The Runs - Dia Ria Vicious,"I'll tell you what sh@t for brains giving ***** to this horsecrap of a band called the hives - take your dog sh*t band back to whatever country you came from and shove Veni Vidi Vicious right up your wazoo you coward that cant make decisions for yourself. Horrible, mainstream, designed by marketing guy, developed by Fox Networks, total a**hole of a sellout society, thats all I have to say, other than learn to swim."
4,Shameless Self Promotion,"Just when you're wondering what ever happened to punk in the US, what with all the bands in the vein of Blink 182, Sum 41, etc., the Hives from Sweden are ready to give the music world the kick in the ... that it needs. Their songs are loud, raw, and explosive, with buzzing guitars and Pelle's snarling vocals. They are absolutely amazing live. ""We like to think that by the time we play the third song, we have the audience in the palm of our hand,"" said the frontman at their concert in Seattle. And they sure did! They were hilarious and charismatic and played one of the most furious, awesome sets I've seen. That same attitude shows up on the record. The Hives are definitely one of the better punk bands out there. ""We are the Hives, we are from Sweden, and we are your new favourite band!"""
4,Scratch that itch,"Tight and loud punk. Vocals get a little grating after awhile, but that's the point. This one was a lot of fun."
3,"Buzz, Buzz, Buzz","Picking up where their countrymen The Nomads left off, Sweden's (or so their bio claims, but don't be surprised if it comes out that they're actually from somewhere like Cleveland or Chicago) Hives churn up a frothy high-octane, soul powered punk rawk maelstrom whose influences can be traced back to the MC5 and 1960's garage bands like The Seeds and The Shadows Of Knight. Boasting a production so raw that you can almost smell the viscera, the sonics exhibited on ""A Get Together To Tear It Apart"" and ""Knock Knock"" expose The Hives' masterplan: plug in and turn it up. Don't be fooled by the cover: The Hives aren't punk rock's answer to The Monkees, more like its version of the men in black. Bottom line: The Hives should be considered dangerous to children and small animals."
4,worth the money,"this is a great cd. nearly all the songs are great, especially supply and demand, hate to say, and the hives introduce the metric system in time. if you like any of those, the rest of the CD is similar. so basically, it's good."
4,Punk RAWK!,"Great collection of fun, high energy songs. The Hives are a great punk/rock group. If you don't know, check them out. The songs are quick, but fun and rocking."
3,Nice but Nothin' New,"Just how do you whip something interesting and exciting out of the same four chords and attitude already claimed by the Ramones, Cheap Trick, the Replacements etc. and, more recently, Green Day, Blink 182 etc.? At this point, the attitude is pretty much set so it's all about arranging those four chords. The Hives come up with a few arresting riffs (the single ""Hate to Tell ..."" NOT being one of them). But the band's big buzz has more to do with riding the Strokes back-to-basics bandwagon. Think of the Hives as the Stones to the Stroke's Beatles. They're meaner, tougher and party heartier. But by this time you've heard it all before."
3,Decent but not worth more than 3 stars-,"First of all, I have to say that not any of the guitar work is original sounding. Every song sounds like a reworked version of the same old thing. The one song I really like is ""Hate to Say I Told You So"" because of its fun sound, but I'm sorry, the Strokes are better. I give them credit, though, for the lyrics. But don't fluff this album up with praise, it would spoil it. The Hives are not the rock-savior though, I'm not sure anyone can save the bland new punk-rock now."
2,music fan,"This has to be one of the most over rated bands of all time. Some songs are good, but most are talentless rants, and over gained power chords."
5,"Listen to the music, not the critics.","This album just plain rocks. I was skeptical of The Hives at first, because I was sick of people compairing all of those ""The bands"" that the mainstream has recently decided to pay attention to. Don't listen to the critics, check these guys out.They are completely doing their own thing. Of course there will be bands out there that might have a few similar elements to their music, but every band has that. It's not fair that they got swept into the wave of *gasp* what's ""trendy"" right now. The Hives have a lot more to offer than 'Hate To Say I Told You So'."
3,ROCK!!!,"Rock and roll is appealing to Little Poomba, but not Big Poomba! I enjoy this album. Great tunes, Big Poomba pleased with production and stars.I would reckon-mend this to Little Poomba, but not Big Poomba, BP already listened and has no money.But anyone else who likes the rock and The Rock, I would definitely reckon-mend this to you. They are better than the Strokes and the White Stripes."
2,Trick or treat!,"Listening to the Hives is a bit like answering your door on Halloween and finding your neighbor's ten year old kids dressed up in homemade Iggy Pop, Fred 'Sonic' Smith and Sky Saxon costumes. They're simply adorable, and you love their spunk, but there's no way in hell you'd mistake them for the real thing. The Hives have obviously spent quite a lot of time perfecting their trashy lyrics, wailing Ron Asheton guitar licks and rock & roll attitude, and therein lies the problem. Everything about this record is flawlessly executed, and totally predictable. It's easy to grow your hair out and jump around with a vintage guitar hollering about tearing things apart, but it's a lot harder to do it like you really mean it."
4,AMAZING!!!!,"i love the Hives. This album is so fast and loud and not like anything else around today, i don't understand how you could not like it. Sure Howlin' Pelle is a bit hard to understand, but he's so high energy and amazing! if you like music, you definetly need to own this CD"
4,It's Loud. It's Fast. It's Swedish.,"Don't believe all of the hype surrounding the Hives. They're good, yes, but they're not anything brand new. The Hives merely put out a sound that had not been heard in the mainstream scene, and for this I am thankful. At a mere 28 minutes, Veni Vidi Vicious is extremely refreshing. Loud, if not grating at times, but it's nice to listen to something slightly different. Granted, there are hundreds of bands thrown into the ""garage rock"" label at this point, but the Hives possess a certain sound that makes them stand out. Perhaps it's Pelle Almqvist's shriek. Or the speed of the songs. The rapidness of each track off of Veni Vidi Vicious makes you wonder what you just listened to. I remember buying this for about 17 dollars when I was 13 and thinking I was completely ripped off when I found out it was under 30 minutes long. I soon realized that 28 minutes or not, it was worth the cash.It's not worth all of the praise, but it's definitely worth the purchase."
3,Better than your average derivitive,"The Hives are a welcome guest in the hot white, shortlived, spotlight. Their hooks are catchy and their stage swagger is fun. Their hammy tunes come off rather MC5-ish and at times Turbonegro - or better yet, Hollywood Superstars (an underground smack-swagger band who boast cult status overseas). I get a kick out of foreigners who come to America and out-America us. Good stuff for the kids, but I prefer the real thing."
2,"Well, I HAVE heard worse","It's nothing THAT great! Sure, the first time you listen to it its highly enegetic and outrageous and you love it, but this CD has no replay value whatsoever. Veni Vidi Vicious? ""use once and destroy"" is more suiting, but thats already taken by Superjoint Ritual. Anyway, this CD is decent, but not if you are looking for depth, lyrical prowess, instrumental skill, talent, or anything else. This is a FUN album, which you dont see much anymore. But Thats about it. Main Offender is actually a really good song, but nothing else really stands out. ""Find yourself another Girl"" somewhat stands out, because its different, but that doesn't mean its good! However, I do respect the fact that they are making a valiant attempt to revive punk rock in these awful times of self proclaimed punk, orpunk bands like BLink 182, Good Charlotte, and Simple plan, who actually all .... This CD is decent but ultimately not worth buying."
3,Dissappointed.,"When I saw this band play live on the MTV music awards their first hit single ""Hate to say I told you so"" I was blown away. I thought to myself that maybe this was my new favorite band. The lead singer was hot and energetic, he belted out the song like nothing else. After buying this CD and giving it one good listen, I have to say that I was terribly dissappointed. I have never listened to the whole CD since, I actually have no idea where it even is at this point. Some songs were great, like ""hate to say i told you so"" and ""main offender"" but everything else couldn't hold my attention. I think this band has great potential, but maybe they were too worried about getting a hit single and not making a great album. I defintely would not reccomend buying this album, if you want their music download a couple of their hit songs and call it good. Spare the whatever dollars and buy yourself an ice cream cone instead!"
1,Too few one star reviews,"I was looking through the reviews of this album and noticed that there were too few one-star reviews. This band deserves 10,000 one-star reviews. Their little cocky attitudes and the fact that nobody in the band wrote the lyrics makes this pop garbage. It doesn't matter if it doesn't sound like Britney or Aguilera, they are just part of another faction of horrible pop."
1,"Unoriginal, boring, repetetive, annoying","This CD just [disappoints]...it's your average CD and the music is really freakin annoying I can't listen to it for very long, it's very simple and repetetive...try the Doves instead."
1,NOT AT ALL HELPFUL,"I got hives last week, and rather than go to a skin doctor, I decided to pick this up. It was not at all useful. The words were often indecipherable. When I could make things out, they had little or not relevance to proper skin care."
3,not that impressed,"while ""hate to say i told you so"" is a great single, and the cover of ""find another girl"" is a great listen, this has so been done before, and so much better... i know, i know, not everything can be completely original, but i find a great deal of these songs to be just plain boring. the supposed ""raw"" energy just isn't there, as this album has been over produced. either pickup some old stooges or mc5, or the white stripes if you want new... listenable, but nowhere near the quality of those other works."
5,It feels like a punch in your face!!! it rocks hard!!!,"Intense, Loud, In Your Face Music. What More Can I Say About These Guys. The Suits are Cool, The Names of These Guys Are Great. How Can Anyone Even Compare These Guys To The Strokes."
3,Fun while it lasted,"If this album didn't get so tiresome I would have given it 5 stars but, fact in the matter is that it gets tiresome so that justifies me taking two stars away. They have lots of catchy tracks that just catch you but when you realize that this is the band you keep listening soon the fire will die. Buy this album but don't over do it. Another thing I must mention is that they [are bad] live I mean not good but this review is on the album not their shows."
3,I Was Hoping For Anaphylactic Shock But All I Got Was Hives,"I Was Hoping For Anaphylactic Shock But All I Got Was The Hives...it's true. With all the Hives-Hype going on I was ready for cardiac arrest on this one....what a disappointment! Yeah, they rock, but they don't ROCK!.....the tracks on the CD are solid and worth listening too, but after a week I ditched this one while I kept playing and playing White Stripes, BRMC, and even the Strokes......if you like this, please take the time to pick up on the other hot bands 'cause you will LOVE! them...."
4,It's alot better than all of this new mainstream [music],"To tell you the truth, I think this cd was pretty good. I agree with some people though when they say that The Strokes are better, because they are. They sound more original and developed, but I think any fan of The Strokes, The White Stripes, or even just the really cool oldschool stuff (i.e. The Ramones, Velvet Underground, ect.) should look into buying this cd. In a world where everything is about your Britneys and Justins, You just need a little sanity. The Hives aren't the best band ever, but they are so much cooler than most anything else."
3,A welcome injection of rawness for modern mainstream punk rockers,"3 1/2Under a half hour The Hives tore through their snarling London-via-Sweden punk revival with glam-rcok inklings (found especially in the singers delivery for better or worse). Many songs do not have the bombastic vision that their singles usually possessed, but from the opening notes it remained undeniable that the unit, however derivative at times, attacked every note and word in full force, somehow almost justifying the short length of the lp."
4,The Future of European Punk,"We all remember the days of The Sex Pistols and and The Clash rocking our worlds with their new european sound, and now covet the albums of such bands as The Hives to save ourselves from the torment of pop music. Such albums as this seem to have cemented their spot towards the top of our collection. The cd starts out with the contagious sounds of Declare Guerre Nucleiare, and never lets up. Although nothing can compare to the wonderous days of The Ramones and Elvis Costello, The Hives come pretty close. Bands such as this enlighten me with hope on the possibility of good music actually being available to the mainstream audience since the days of Nirvana. If you enjoy to be blown out of your mind with the rocking tunes of fast drums and guitars with amps set to blow your mind, I highly reccommend this album."
4,"Hyped up, yes, but still a good record.","I will admit that this cd is hyped up, and most certainly is not the greatest thing to hit rock, but it's still a good cd. ... Well, it's punk rock, that's all. If you like loud punk, you'll like this. If not, you won't. Plain and simple."
5,Good stuff,"Very surprised to hear how good this album is. Compared to the other new, retro bands out there including The Strokes and The Vines, these guys are the ""real deal"". There's nothing like blasting track#2 and driving at high speeds down the freeway. This album is rockin' and fun!"
4,"The Hives, Your New Favorite Band","Veni Vidi Vicious is the future of indie rock. The Hives jump in your face with crazy guitar parts, killer drums, and insane vocals. Sweeds know how to rock. They might be a little cocky on stage but that's ok cause there cd rocks. Songs like the catchy Hate To Say I Told You So and the imfamous Main Offender give them an excuse to be conceited. The only downside to the Hives is the first 4 times through the cd all the songs sound the same except their vein attempt on a ballad (Another Girl) which comes out as monotonus. With the growing populatirty of the hives, Indie Rock might be on the rise. 8/10"
3,"better than the vines, not Bona Roba","The hives are OK. Each song packs a punch and ends, without fail, at the strike of 2 minutes and 30 seconds. But their songs wear thin quickly. They're definitely better than the Vines, but for some great 70's rock revival, listen to Bona Roba."
4,it's good...,"dad says that he likes iggy pop and the stooges, but since they don't make anymore records... these guys are o.k. what's more important is that there are bands out there that play their own instruments. so when the next velvet underground, thirteenth floor elevators, or jam cd drops you can go buy that. until then there's bands like white stripes, hives, mooney suzuki and other bands that don't [stink]. it's just a matter of time until frat dorks start buying it up."
3,A new low for the hives,when i heard this cd i was a mad. now don't get me wrong i love the hives i have this and two other cd's by the hives. but how i see it is that this was not hives i now of in other words they (the hives) did not have has mutch of the feel of the past hives cd's.
3,That one song is good,This is a very satisfactory CD. Do yourself a favor and buy the Vines instead.
1,the hype,"the hives have catchy tunes, and this cd may strike some as new or original in the likes of other ""punk"" of today (new found glory, starting line, good charlotte, ect.) but this cd is basically a tribute (rip-off) of early rolling stones or the who. not to mention, the hives arent the only swedish act garage rocking the U.S., the (international) noise conspiracy (ex-refused) have been playing garage rock style punk for a few years now, after refused's the shape of punk to come elluded to the ""new"" sound. for anyone who settles for the hives, im sorry, for good garage rock, pick up the (international) noise conspiracy's survival sicksness."
5,Great cd,THE OVERALL CAPACITY OF THIS CD IS INTELLECTUAL TO A POINT OF CENTRIFICUL MOTION ON AN ISOSOLIES TRIANGLE. DEFINITLY CAUGHT MY ATTENTION BECAUSE OF THE KINETIC ENERGY STORED IN ITS UPPER BICEP. I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD LISTEN TO IT BECAUSE OF ITS FRICTION TO AN EXTRAVAGANT RADIUS.DUDE
1,....,"People are running around saying how cool. Why? This is not artistic. This is .... A complete waste of my time to listen to (all nearly 30 minutes of music--aka EXTREMELY short CD). There may be some talent here, but it needs to be honed by a serious sound engineer and some brilliant producers. That's all I have to say about that."
4,Nice starter set,I really liked this starter set-much cheaper than buying each piece seperately. The coconut house opening was too small for my hermit crabs. They love climbing the wall-make sure the lid is on or they will escape!
2,Yawn...,"HRH fans - stay away! This is a very, very poor book, with no additional revelations about The Man. This is an exercise in fawning. Skip it, and wait for the HRH movies that rumor has in development at several Hollywood studios."
4,Lava buns are hot!,"Heated seat cushion ,""lava buns"", did it's job well. I was afraid it would not stay heated but it worked for several hours. Only caution is to be extra careful when removing from microwave as it gets quite hot!"
1,Only the inside arrived no cushion cover,"the product arrived with only the inside warming pad, without the outside. Basically it was ""naked"". I had to return it since it was useless. The picture of the product is wrong, or the product itself was shipped wrong. I never found out.At least there is the good Amazon service, they accepted the return based on wrong description and I received the refund."
4,Lava Buns,"I replaced a very old lava buns. The new one is not quite as good, the velco strap is not as tight. Also when I took the consumer tag off the cushion seam ripped. It gets hot and stays hot but not as long as my old one did."
1,it did not even come with a cover,It was not worth the price at all because it did not even come with a cover. It is very disappointing.
3,Great but short lasting,"These things are awesome --- when you first heat them up. I went to a 2 hour tailgate before a game and by the time we settled in at the stadium they were barely warm and were nothing more than seat cushions (very comfortable ones I'll admit). If you're going straight to a game I highly recommend. If there is going ot be any sort of delay, they last about 3 hours before the heat really goes out"
5,Love this product!,"I bought one of these as an early Christmas present for my 89-year old dad. He goes to the cemetery to visit my mom every single day and he sits on a freezing cold (even in the summer) granite bench. He just loves this nice warm cushion to sit on.We don't bother taking the insert out - we just put the entire cushion in the microwave for 3 minutes - that's all it takes. It stays warm for hours. Taking that insert out and putting it back in is a pain especially when it's hot.It's not like we're using this on the weekends for sporting events. We use it every day and so far, it has been great. So much so, I bought one for myself and drive to work in the morning and on the way home in the evening with a nice warm seat!"
5,Works great!,"I first got Lava Buns for my daughter to sit on in the car on the ride to school on cold winter mornings (she doesn't like to carry a big coat to school). I also have used it on some cold winter drives, and it works great! It retains heat for several hours. I found out it also works wonders as a heating pad if you have muscle pain--plently of heat without having to plug it in."
4,Stayin' toasty while watching the grandkids!,"From the land of all things ""cold,"" love the Lava Buns! We watch the grandkids' hockey and, outdoor sports in comfort. Even used them at earlier Twins' games, now that we have an outdoor baseball field! I highly recommend this product. We enjoy the Lava Buns so much, we have given the product as gifts to others."
5,Great!,I bought these for use at winter soccer games. They work great. My granddaughter wouldn't sit on it right away because she thought it was weird. As soon as she did - I couldn't get it away from her. She wanted to share with her team.
5,Best invention yet!!! No plug ins needed!,I received one of these 2 years ago and just loved it. I gave away 2 of them for Christmas this past year...what a hit!!!
4,Awesome Lava Buns,"These Lava Buns are an incredibly awesome product. I sit at my kids baseball & softball games in the spring and nearly freeze, but thanks to Lava Buns I can stay much warmer throughout the games. Easily portable and serve to soften the stadium seats as well. Only drawback is they don't stay hot long enough - seems the metal stadium seats suck the heat out too fast."
4,Work as advertised and provide a very nice seat cushion as well,"My wife and I were surprised the first time we used these. We took them to a nearby beach which can be cold with the wind coming in off the ocean. Not only did the Lava Buns keep us warmer the gel actually provided a more comfortable seat which was an unexpected bonus.They are not difficult to use, removing the gel pack and placing it into a microwave for heating and then putting it back into the cloth pouches. I use a dish towel and it is enough to deal with the heat when pulling them out of the microwave oven.Good quality construction so they can be expected to be used for many years."
5,Seat cushion,"Works great at football games when the temp drops. If your toosh is warm your whole body feels it. Need one to wrap around my shoulders. Thanks, Jim W"
5,Great for taking to work!!!,"My office building is freezing, and we are unable to have electric heating blankets/pads due to the fire hazards involved. I bought one of these just to see if it would help me stay warm. It has really made my work life more enjoyable, because I don't have to bundle up with sweaters and blankets anymore. I heat it up a couple times a day, and I'm good to go. Definitely worth buying!!!"
5,Fantastic. Didn't think they were going to work before I ordered but...,"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with this product. I was a bit hesitant to order, it seemed too good to be true. These are fantastic. We use them golfing when it's cold outside or during barbeques outside on our deck. When we're done, just plop them on the sofa and they keep the seat warm for hours. Haven't tried them cold, but they work great hot so I'd imagine they're just as good cold."
3,Disapointing,"I thought it was a pretty good book, but when I buy a book that purports to be about Chicago, that is what I expect to get. I would guess that about half the pictures are either from europe or from other Donauschwaben Groups in cities other than Chicago."
5,EXCELLENT SINGER,I loved this cd! I'm so glad it was finally released on the U.S. About the singer!!! well what can I say! She can really sing!!! FORGET ABOUT singers like Thalia(yeah I know she's beautifull) or Shakira(yeah I know she can move her hips!)or Paulina Rubio(yeah I know she looks great in bikinis) but my god!! they aren't near to MONICA NARANJO this is a singer with an awesome voice and great shows!!! A powerful singer!!! The reason I compare her is because of all those hispanic singers doing the crossover to this country!! And believe me!! give yourself a chance to listen to Monica you will not be dissapointed!!!
5,Very good,"This book is one of the best I've come across on the subject of modern warfare. The chapters are well organized , easily read, and brutally honest on the truths of modern war as it is today and will be in the future. Dunnigan delves not only into tactis and strategy, but also other, often overlooked details of war in the modern world. Among these topics are morale of soldiers, training, equipment and technology, and logistics. Recommended for any student of warfare and current global issues."
3,Good overall explanations with some bad stats,"The author of this book does a good job of explaining what is going on behind the scenes before, during and after a war. However, his attempts at placing numbers on things are misleading. He goes on and on about tactics and strategy yet he fails to see that there is more to war than just sheer numbers (he does mention that but doesn't follow his own advice). The analisis in this book, in my opinion, are leading a lot toward the superiority of US forces while diminishing the fighting potential of any other nation. This makes the book bias to one side and thus useless when one wants to see a honest comparison. Some of the numbers given are incorrect or misleading, for example Canada does not have 2400 AFV (maybe if you count all the trucks :)). Overall good explanation of war as long as you ignore comments about country X vis country Y that are not a direct result of an actual combat (i.e. ignore predictions)."
5,Dunnigan is the best,"Not only is it extremely informative, but Dunnigan takes a potentially dry topic and makes it fun. Provocative thinking, excellent writing."
5,Thanks MTV,the only good thing MTV has done in the last fifteen years was play a slice of London Still on some douchey show of theirs. I got to hear this band and have been with em ever since. Great album and a good follow up to up all night.
1,Can't get any cheesier,"The worst live show I ever seen, it looks like it was transfer from vhs format, sometimes you see Ted like looking at the strings of the guitar as if he is learning a new song and he's looking to make sure he's plucking the right string, well, let me tell you... he forgot most of his song because what he's looking at are the lyrics wich are taped to the stage on the floor and in between songs he goes to the right side of the stage to create a diversion while the bass player turns the page with his feet and after that Ted moves back into that spot on stage so he can then read his own lyrics that's why you will see a lot of kneeling on his part. I like Ted Nugent from the 70's but this show is really a turn-off. Ted... stay away from showbusiness is no longer your cup of tea and you're doing better as an NRA spokeperson (maybe)"
2,Ho Hum,This movie is a cross between the 6 million dollar man and I robot set back in the mid 1980's Robert Conrad does an ok job. The film isn't great and the story line is week.
3,"Overal a good movee, but...","Good acting, good story, but not believable at all. It is a real stretch. Conventional story of kids on vacation from college, and eat shrooms, and scary things happen. Yawn. Some parts good, and little jumpy scary, but not classic."
1,You've seen this before,"SPOILERS!!!Yet another one of those movies that ends with a ""twist"" where the main character has had a psychotic break with reality and is the killer all along. Honestly, it doesn't matter if the rest of the movie has been any good leading up to that because that ending just ruins the rest of the movie for me. At this point, it's probably tied with ""It was all a dream!"" for worst twist ending. I really wish screenwriters would stop falling back on this cliché. Take a cue from David Lynch; if weird stuff is happening, just leave it at that. I'm sure more people than just me will respect you for it."

5,great cd,bought as a christmas gift and love it!!! my husband and i love listening to all the hits!!! great cd!!!
4,Sammy Kershaw Is Star Quality,"A solid performance by a singer who doesn't receive enough praise for his singing talents. It's a keeper, and a CD that I will listen to often."
3,"Disappointingly, one of Barnard's lesser efforts","I've thoroughly enjoyed past Barnard books, but this one left me flat. He's too skilled a writer not to have some effective passages, but the story and characters were underdeveloped. His social commentary regarding homeless kids is pointed, but I missed his dark, satiric humor. The mystery of the stabber is solved, but ironically, the resolution doesn't really contribute to any of the characters' development, leaving me curiously uninvolved with them. Only Midge stood out with any vividness. All this and a lack of psychological suspense makes this a readable but blah experience."
2,AMC huh?,"None of these six John Wayne programmers can in any way be considered CLASSIC, and don't be fooled by that AMC logo on the front cover. You are NOT getting pristine studio quality copies, but dubs of half-century old, well-used 16mm broadcast films.The six titles are in the public domain and widely available from every budget label DVD maker out there. They're mid-1930s hour-length oaters, typical undistinguished Saturday matinee double feature stuff.In the past, this label --GENIUS ENTERTAINMENT-- has issued DVDs in slimlne cases and cardboard envelopes.A big caveat emptor here!PS--Check out that first customer review of""AMC"" MOVIES: GREAT DETECTIVE CLASSICS."
4,from Abingdon Press,"Jesus used food and mealtimes to build community and to teach about the Father, Son, and Kingdom. (Some of the numerous examples include the wedding at Cana, the call to Levi and to Zaccheus, the banquet parables, eating with Pharisees and also with persons of ill repute, the miraculous feedings with fish and bread.) Table Fellowship will deal with the concepts of miracle meals, eucharist, hospitality, etiquette, clean and unclean, and others. This volume will help participants to experience and appreciate the eucharistic quality of daily life through meals with family, church and other communities and to invite people to God's table. This study is part of the Jesus Collection and has 8 sessions"
3,so so book,"I used this textbook for a junior level class. Frankly, although the book is good initially, the end of chapter problems are way too hard, especially in chapters 3,4,6 and 7. Also, much of the book is formula, which is a bit too much for undergrads."
3,Book is good but...,"The book is a solution set for ""Probability and Random Processes for Electrical Engineering"". It has some solutions, but not all. I would say about 30% of the problems' answers are given, which is good; but it would be better if they can reduce the font size and include more answers."
4,So helpful!,"It was really hard to undestand the context related to probability stuff and it is the best way to solve the many problems in order to understand. In my case, the examples of the text book were not enough. That's why I purchased this book. Absolutely, my thought was right. This book is so helpfule to understand the unclear questions related to probability. The explanation of each question give me the visualization of probability world. If you are preparing the exam, buy this."
4,Good Book,This is a good book for a subject that is simple but not easy. The author introduces the reader to fundamental concepts in probability with minimal mathematical abstraction and more examples than competing texts. This is the best book on the subject I have come across with the exception of the Schaum's Outline for probability and statistics.
2,Very few solved problems,This book contains solutions to very few back of the chapter problems making it almost useless and definitely not worth the price
4,Good for the methematically oriented,"Lets face it... probability theory is based on a lot of math that one does not see in the introductory level math classes at college. This book explains a lot of the more difficult stuff well. I am not one for doing the problems at the end of the chapter. For a general overview, I found this book to be good. Not great, but good. It did most of the concept explaining through examples, and as an engineer, that suited me fine. Disclaimer - don't buy this if you don't like looking at a long formula, you will simply end up hating it."
4,An excellent first course in Probability,I am surprised by the negative reviews of this book. I used this book as an undergraduate and it is still THE reference I reach for even in the more advanced courses in probability and random processes I have taken since. It develops topics using intuition rather than beating you over the head with abstraction (those looking for measure theoretic approaches to probability look elsewhere like Billingsley). The numerous examples serve to solidify the readers understanding with applications to real problems - something that is easily lost in more abstract/advanced tomes. This is an excellent book for a first course.
3,Too much compromise to be a usable textbook,"This book may not be too friendly to those who are unfamiliar with the subject. This is because the subject is unfriendly. Before you complain about this book, take a look at the other books on the subject to realize that the author took a great effort to make it accessible. However, I personally do not like the degree of compromise made in this book. Too many uninsightful examples, and lacking detailed discussions. This cannot be a good reference book. For reference, I like Papoulis, for enjoy reading deep insights, I like Gardner, and I recommend Peebles for people who hated this book. However, Leon-Garcia is easier to read and faster moving than Papoulis and Gardner. It is not easy attempting to combine mathematical rigor (which this book still lacks) and engineering point of view from many application areas in one text book. Three stars because I like other books better, but this should be the lower bound of evaluation given to this book."
5,Review,Very cute for children. fast delivery and good condition. I don't think I will leave any more feedbacks cause they want you to write a novel on it.
4,Prather is always good.,Harding hitting pulp at it's best. That's Richard Prather. He keeps you reading and guessing until the end. And he does it all with a keen sense of humor. If you like noir fiction this is the real deal.
5,Murder in New Orleans,"I just found the Skip Langdon mysteries by Julie Smith and can't wait to read them all. She writes well, has lots of details of life in New Orleans, and a great group of characters."
3,My thoughts,"Yes, this book was published before Facebook. However it was NOT written BEFORE the World Wide Web existed as another reviewer states. The web was alive and well in the early 90's when this book was written. I really hate when books get re-titled by publishers.The first Julie Smith book I read was The Sourdough Wars. I did not finish that book because the writing was crap. I swore that I would never read another book by Ms. Smith but I bought a bunch of books in an auction lot and this book was included under its original title of New Orleans Beat. It still was not the best story I have read but it certainly beat The Sourdough Wars by a mile. I will at least consider not bypassing Ms. Smith's work if I find it in a used book store (aka buying cheap)."
2,Disappointed,I have read quite a few Julie Smith books and liked them but this book was a huge disappointment. The book is obviously an older book with a new title. There is nothing about Facebook in the story and the book was written before Facebook existed. The story was over involved and moved slowly. This is not a book I'd recommend.
1,Horrible Editing Kills Lovely Book,"This book should have been a great biography of Johnny Pesky, a Nice Guy who is finally finishing first. The author took the time to interview many people, and found much material that was not widely known about Pesky's personal life.However, he never bothered to edit the book. It is a nightmarish mish-mash of material. Many times the same story or fact is repeated in several consecutive chapters because there is no strong outline of what material is to be covered when. This jumping back and forth effect also causes confusion in understanding the sequence of events in his life. The poor editing turns this book into primary material to slog through to garner information, rather than a book one can read for enjoyment.This book is a fly-by-night job. There are other books on Pesky now; I recommend searching them out."
5,60174 Warn ATV Mount,This is a quality product. Strong. Bolted on perfectly. Didn't have to do any mod's. Highly recomended.
5,Mounting a Warn Winch,"The installation was completed without any problems. The package contained all the necessary parts, as it should. The directions were easily understood and followed. The winch performs flawlessly. No one could ask for anything more. All promises made were kept. Completely recommended."
5,It was very imformative and simple.,"The book explained simple commands ""sit"" and ""heel"" and ""come."" It was easy to understand and itis a non-disipilnary way of training. I trained my dog with ease."
3,Should have more detail,"The book is clearly written and the instructions work well if you are patient and persistent enough. Mr. Maller is one of the most respected trainers and he knows what he is talking about. Yet, the book does not cover in detail the problems that araise when training for obedience (there are always problems). The lack of photography (there are no photos, not even in the cover) makes the book look a little ""cheap"". Nevertheless this book contains some very good information. If you want a trained dog, but not for the obedience ring, this is a great book to follow."
1,Don't believe everything you read,I bought this book based on customer reviews and was disappointed. I found not only the look to be dated but the information as well. He actually reccomends kneeing your dog in the chest to break him of jumping up. This is preferable to stepping on his toes because that would be harder for the owner to maneuver-Too militaristic/barbaric for me.
3,Good To Have,"I used this book, in conjunction with other training materials. It's useful, but I wouldn't rely on it as my sole training guide. I used it to get a basic idea of how to train my dog once we had passed the 8mo. mark and were basically doing OK."
1,Yeah right,"Bought the book, was skeptical, and I turned out to be right. I couldn't teach my adult dog how to behave in 21 days unless I had all day every day to devote to it. It might work for some people, but not for me."
1,Didnt like this book,I did not like this book at all. It states to wait for the puppy to do the wanted action and praise the puppy. That to me does not seem like the way to train a puppy. I have ordered the dog whisperer video and am hoping for better results.
4,Brotherhood,"In another of the Tillerman series, Cynthia Voight explores the relationship between James and Sammy as each attempts to discover his inner self and who he wants to be. As the brothers search for a long missing father they grow to understand and admire each other. Although the plot bogs down in detail at times, there is enough action to keep the reader turning pages through to the finish. Not as captivating as the first two books in the series.Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge"
1,This book is not for every one.,"Before anyone reads this, I have a confession to make. I'm thirteen, male, considered intelligent, and my favorite genres are Sci-fi and Fantasy.The concept is intrigiuing. Unfortunately, the author doesn't expand beyond the ""Boys look for father, find themselves..."" idea. This severly limits the plot progression and character development.The excessive description was taken one step too far, detracting instead of adding to the story. If the books are plants, and description is water, Cynthia Voigt's neighborhood is now a lake. Case in point: There are more than four full paragraphs describing one character's musings about flea eyes.The truth is, I felt very little desire to complete the book...... until I remembered that a major part of my grade depended on it. Even though I resented reading it, others may find it to be one of their favorite books. Everyone has different tastes."
2,not in the best shape,"Book was labeled as being in good shape, but very worn. The story was great, followed along with the Tillerman series and gave a wonderful story of one of the young Tillerman boys."
4,Good Book,"I thought thatthis book was really good. It really held my attention and was a quick read. It wasn't as good as Homecoming and Dicey's Song were, but it was still really good nd definatly worth reading. It's about Sammy and James going to find their father. I have to say, the plot is a little strange but the book itsself is still really really good. It's one of my favorites."
3,It held my interest the way the boys looked for thier father,I liked the way how Voigt held the story. I couldn't put the book down
1,Junk,It didn't work with the computer I bought it for and the reponse I got to try and fix it was weak at best.
4,Josh Groban Live at The Greek,"Josh Groban Live at The Greek is wonderful. Some of the first few songs are not sung with the intensity and powerfullness that Josh is famous for, but as the DVD progresses, Josh's voice comes full circle, and in the end, Josh once again, shows everyone just what he is capable of."
3,"Confusing performance at the ""Greek""","I'm not entirely unhappy with my Greek concert DVD, but I'm not thrilled either. I bumped the rating up to level 3 because I loved the ""Believe"" bonus and ""Remember"" was nice. What disappointed me was poorly redone ""Canto Alla Vita,"" and Josh sounding ill on four songs. He started singing at a young age and perhaps his voice is changing, but I really think it could be helped with voice training. It couldn't hurt. I did enjoy seeing him perform selections from ""Closer,"" but why so few is puzzling. I'm a fan and this concert was okay. If you haven't bought Josh Groban's CD's yet, I recommend that you pass this one up and get ""Josh Groban in Concert,"" which was his first. It's absolutely beautiful in every respect."
2,Not a Good Avenue for Josh Groban's Talents,"Josh Groban has such a beautiful voice that I bought ""Live at the Greek"" before the PBS showing. I loved his first CD and was carried away with his first concert! When I saw ""Greek"" for the first time I was shocked to hear his voice and the problems he was having on a few of the songs. No, I didn't come here first because I don't care about other people's ratings. As a matter of fact I noticed that some people were posting 5-star ratings before the Concert was shown or even sold! Hmmm. I'm just giving my review now. Unfortunately I am not happy with what I heard because of course I could also hear it on the CD. My Christmas money could have been better spent."
1,Not a Keeper!,"""Live at the Greek"" will be making a trip back to the store...for a refund. This mess doesn't deserve to share space with my other Josh Groban CD's. What happened to his voice? I don't know and I'm so disappointed I dont really care. Looks like many fans noted the problems with Josh's voice. I heard it in the first few minutes and just sat there shocked. I sincerely hope that the mistakes made here will not happen again."
2,Just my Opinion,"I think ""Live at the Greek"" had great potential. The potential to be as terrific as anything Josh Groban has done before. Unfortunately for me I can hear the vocal issues (strain, nasal sound) on some songs that others have noted. There's just no true comparison to the wonderful vocals he has done in his three other CD's. This isn't his best work or even ""Closer"" to his best."
5,Josh Groban - Live at the Greek,"This is a taste of the most fabulous concert I have ever attended. Not only does Josh Groban have the voice of an angel, but he possesses an amazing ability to share that gift with the audience, bringing them into his soul and delivering joy to their hearts.His voice lifts me up and awakens the deepest of emotions. He never fails to calm my world and place life's difficulties into their proper perspective. An extraordinary pleasure to watch.The Greek concert was a perfect combination, Josh and his fans interacting wonderfully. He's the greatest singer of our time and we are truly blessed."
2,"The Greek: Bought it,, Watched it, Returned it","I won't wax on about why because it seems like many folks already stated the obvious. I bought it because I love Josh Groban and have everything he's done so far. Yes, I am a fan. I watched it eagerly expecting to hear his gorgeous voice. I watched it twice, still expecting to hear his gorgeous voice. That didn't happen. I liked his different look, the drums, sets, all that. No problem with it at all. My expectations were to hear his gorgeous voice. I heard a nasaly congested voice instead. So I went to my store and returned it. When I got home I played Josh Groban's first concert DVD and I was happy with it from the opening scene of of ""Alla Luce Del Sole,"" to the finale of ""Let me Fall."" That's Heavenly! This concert is farther south."
2,"Josh Groban's ""Greek"" is disappointing","I don't know if I'll keep my ""Live at the Greek"" DVD yet, but I'm close to returning mine too. It just isn't a fitting second concert for the young man with the gorgeous voice. Duh--we know it's LIVE. Another DUH---we know it's OUTDOORS. The producers knew that too!! What's aggravating is that they decided to record Josh Groban at the Greek knowing his performance could be affected. What's unforgivable is that they released it knowing Groban's performance was less than good. The fact that most of the songs are just repeated here from previous recordings makes it less desirable. The fact that Josh sounds so poor makes it tragic."
2,PBS Concert at the Greek,"This was Josh Groban?? That's what I kept asking myself while I watched the concert and felt my interest go away quickly. The only performance that even reminded me of the previous concert was when Groban sang with the beautiful Lucia Micarelli on the violin. But while she was dressed in a lovely gown and performed from the heart, Groban looked unkempt and remained standing in the dark. At the very end of the performance he shouted out her name and she was seated to the side. Her solo was lovely. Josh Groban was less than entertaining (since he wanted to do that rather than show us his gorgeous vocal talents). Wierd camera angles, loud and different arrangements songs that have become his standards, and bad sound make this concert really poor. I heard some of the ""old"" Josh Groban but the strain still asserted itself. It was more of a strain for me to watch. Forget the pledge breaks, this was one annoying mess!"
2,"Sadly, a very poor performance by Groban","I was extremely excited when the ""Live at the Greek"" concert DVD went on sale in Christmas. With all the pre-release reviews (like the one above) from rabid fans I was sure this one would be yet another beautiful recording by Josh Groban. To my great shock and disappointment, Josh Groban's voice was very poor, very nasaly and he looked less so different. The once gorgeous looking and gorgeous sounding guy is sadly no more. His stage presence is uncomfortable because he knew his voice wasn't up to par. Not even close. Too bad for Groban. I can tell that even here on Amazon his sales record isn't even close to bottom. I returned mine."
2,"Voice Issues Mar the ""Greek""","I was very happy to buy Josh Groban's second concert ""Live at the Greek,"" even though I did not see it on PBS first. However, when I watched the concert I felt so disheartened by Groban's performance I couldn't believe it was the same man! In ""Mi Mancherai"" I immediately heard a nasaly strain in his voice. Disappointing because it's one of the more lovely songs on ""Closer."" Speaking of ""Closer"" where was it? There's only a handful from that CD and too many of previous CD's that had already been done on the first concert. Everything about the ""Greek"" is sloppily done as though the filming was an afterthought. One thing I know for sure. After buying the ""Greek"", I won't be buying a ticket for the concert when it comes to my city. Another thing: I'll never buy another Josh Groban CD without checking it out first."
2,"Exchanged the first, returned the second","I bought my ""Live at the Greek"" DVD at a local Walmart and it sounded very bad too (the often-mentioned nasaly sound). So I returned that one and bought another today. Unfortunately it too sounds nasaly as well. I don't know what the problem is, but I won't be getting a third. I think the chances of my getting a superior DVD like a few mentioned here are slim to none. I don't believe this is really representative of Josh Groban's voice but I can't give a rave review for a defective DVD either. Odd, though. My sister only watched it on PBS and said Groban sounded that way on the televised concert. Warner brothers should do a recall so Josh's wonderful reputation isn't harmed by this lousy copy. How about it Warner???"
2,Hopefully better next time,"I passed up buying ""Live at the Greek"" after watching Josh Groban's concert on PBS. I heard the now infamous ""nasal"" voice then and knew it wouldn't be one to add to my music collection. I hope Groban's production crew will take note of the lagging sales and poor reviews and never record Groban in an outdoor theatre again. There's no way we can hear the rich deep voice with all the background noise and outdoor elements to affect him."
2,Who is the Real Josh Groban?,"After watching ""Live at the Greek"" on PBS I'm really confused. The first time I saw Josh Groban was on PBS with his first live concert. It was wonderful, beautiful, perfect in every way and I bought the DVD many times over (for me, for gifts). Well ""Live at the Greek"" was a big surprise, and not a good one. It's a mystery as to what has happened to the man with the golden voice. It's certainly no longer beautiful. I guess if you love watching those gosh darn big screens, hearing the LOUD screaming of grown women, and don't mind a nasaly singer....you'll love this DVD. This all comes with the package. The first concert was a sensory feast, both visually and to the ears. This one was minimally bearable."
2,Oooooh. This is painful,"Josh Groban's Greek concert was painful to watch and even more painful to hear. I taped his PBS concert from the first showing but couldn't watch it through. I watched it later thinking it was just me and it would sound better. Sad for me, Josh didn't sound better. He didn't even look good either."
1,Josh as a Rocker???,"Ooooh. I never thought this would happen. Josh Groban with the most beautiful voice on earth, now a rocker?? Or whatever he's supposed to be cause I'm not sure. Josh doesn't even look like he's doing what he really wants to do. The strain of all the stupid concerts and trying to make everyone but himself happy is really showing in his voice. Let's get the original Josh back and dump the slacker I see at the Greek. I didn't buy it either, but I'm hoping to get the next CD. I'm also hoping that the old Josh comes back. Who wants a DVD with a bunch of sloppy silly old women doing lots of screaming???? Not me fer sure."
2,A very Confusing second concert by Josh Groban,"I remember in the early stages of Josh Groban's career there were lots of comments about his singing style...whether it was Pop or Classical. What I and millions of others loved was that it was both, wrapped up in a gorgeous package and performed beautifully. Now we have the Greek but in such a confusing mix that it leaves me asking HUH?? This concert has Pop and Classical styled songs, sung in a rock-pop-classical-alternative music mix. We have a rock drum solo, flashing overhead lights, audience viewpoints with twirling glow sticks, moving backgrounds. So much of everything!! That wouldn't even be a blip on the radar if it weren't for Josh's voice too. It's good, poor, great, nasal, good, great, good. By the end of the concert I was so darned confused I was exhausted. Of course I was disappointed too."
2,Live at the Greek on PBS,I consider myself one of the lucky ones because I watched Josh Groban's Greek concert on PBS before deciding to buy it. I immediately heard his voice problems and decided it wasn't for me. Lucky for me I didn't get stiffed buying an expensive DVD and CD that I wouldn't enjoy. I didn't watch more than 40 minutes of the PBS concert and it was free.
2,Where's the Real Josh Groban????????,"omg....What did they do with the real Josh Groban? Who's this guy?? It's not the Josh Groban I fell in love with as soon as I saw him on Ally McBeal!! THAT guy had a tremendous voice. His first CD was beyond description, just terrific. His first concert was gorgeous. But THIS!! What happened to my guy? Oksy it wasn't all terrible. But I just couldn't take all the other silly women screaming over him. And Josh's voice was not good.Give me back MY Josh Groban!!"
2,"Disappointing Performance by Josh Groban at ""Greek""","I got my DVD from Amazon.Com on 12/29. I've watched it four times and each times I just sit there thinking I'll find more to enjoy. Simply stated, I can't enjoy Josh Groban's singing in the Greek Theatre. The sound is very poor and Josh's voice, his only true talent, is not always good. Add to that the annoying lighting, and alternative style music and this is pretty much a disappointment. Groban sounds congested and like he's trying to sing from his nose in three songs. ""Canto Alla Vita"" which was so beautiful in his first concert is ripped apart here with a grating psychodelic introduction on the synthocizer by Groban. YUK. After about the first 30 minutes, Groban's voice seems to clear but gee, it's too little too late."
2,Lower your Standards for the Greek,"If you can lower your musical standards enough, you'll be able to ignore the ""nasal"" and ""weak"" voice coming out of Josh Groban to actually buy this DVD. I watched it on PBS and couldn't watch more than the first 20 minutes. I bought his first CD because it was excellent. Since I don't accept this nasaly performance as even okay, I didn't buy this DVD set. Looks like I should thank my blessings."
2,"Watched ""Greek"" on PBS","I watched Josh Groban's concert ""Live at the Greek,"" when it was televised by PBS in December. I heard the vocal strains then and decided not to buy the DVD/Cd combo then. I can tell from the comments here that I made a good decision. Hopefully the next thing Groban does is better. I don't think he has more room to disappoint anyone again."
1,"Returned my ""Greek"" DVD Twice, Silly me!!","I bought Josh Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" album in early December. From the start of the DVD I heard Groban's nasaly voice and came here to Amazon. I read the ""Defective DVD"" posts and enthusiastically said it had to be the DVD. I returned it to the store and got another. We're talking a 20 mile drive each way. Popped the DVD in and, well I heard Groban being nasaly again!! This one went back too. If I ever do this again I will remain in the store to hear it first."
1,"""Live at the Greek""","Because Josh Groban is still young with a wealth of beautiful music already completed, I bought this concert DVD/CD before it was shown on PBS. So far I've watched it twice and could hardly bear to see it a second time. It's dreadful! In the first 20 minutes I could tell he was having problems controlling the quality of his voice. It was powerful but definitely affected. Power alone does not make a good vocalist. It just comes off sounding loud. Later Groban does seem to rebound but for me that's too late."
1,Not MY Problem,"I bought""Live at the Greek.""like many others,I did not like or evenenjoyit.This is my review.Whether people like it or not,I get my shot at it,just likeeveryone else.So it's not MY problemif you don't like my review.It's yours.""Live at the Greek""was not evenlistenable.Groban sounded bad.That's HIS problem.Groban looked slobby.That's HIS problemWarner Bros,Reprise Records,even Josh Groban himself,aren't lining upto refund my money.That's MY problem.It won't happen again.Because I won't waste my money againThat's THEIR problem.Don't like my review?That's YOUR problem"
1,OMG.....THIS IS AWFUL!!,"I can't believe I wasted my money on ""Live at the Greek"", $34 to be exact. What happened to Josh's beautiful voice?? The voice that used to be so in control, so lovely?? His voice at the ""Greek"" is one nasaly, weak and AWFUL!! Josh looks bad too. What happened?? Whatever the reasons, I'm not going to keep this badly done DVD and CD in my house. It doesn't belong with my Josh Groban music. He was just too good to push this on us. Since everyone in charge of making this DVD, including Josh, had to know it was bad, I'm not making any excuses for them either. They only part that I enjoyed was watching ""Alejate,"" but I already have it on his first concert DVD. This one is AWFUL."
2,"Listen before you Buy ""Live at the Greek""","If you're considering buying Josh Groban's Greek concert DVD, please consider the many issues noted on this site. It certainly can't hurt if you go to a store that will play if for you and you can decide for yourself. At the very least, get it from a vendor that will refund your money if you're unhappy. I ordered mine before it was televised on PBS, but when I received it I saw the same problems with Josh Groban's voice that many reviewers write about. Unfortunately, I can't return it."
2,Groban's Second Concert Not Impressive,"Josh Groban's vocals in ""Live at the Greek"" can't even be compared to his previous work. In his first CD, his first concert, and ""Closer"" his voice was absolutely gorgeous and perfect in every way. We heard a young man who deserved every accolade and he had a stage presence to match. The Greek concert DVD has none of that. The vocals on ""Mi Mancherai"" and ""Remember when it rained,"" are so poor with a much noticed nasal sound in his voice, it's shocking. And if I have to read one more review reminding the rest of the world that it was recorded ""LIVE!"" I'll choke. We're not deaf, people. Nor are we stupid. We KNOW it was recorded live. We can hear the massive roar of crazed fans. We can see them constantly. That it's a live concert is evident. My review is that this concert didn't impress me at all and if Josh Groban wants to reach out to those of us who initially bought his CD's and concert DVD, he better take care of his voice."
1,Live at the Greek,"I saw the concert this weekend and it pains me to say that I didn't enjoy it. Simply dreadful sound, over-the-top staging and poor voice control from Josh Groban himself."
2,OMG......!!,"I loved Josh Groban!! He was so super with that voice, even for a dweeby kind of guy. But this is so not him!! I liked only two songs from this DVD and the rest is garbage. He's so nasaly and slacker-looking. Hey, I'm a teenager and I don't like it. I read someone's review where they said it shouldn't have been done and never released like this. Josh should settle on what he wants to be and stop this. He needs a new manager and, oh yeah, a voice coach!!!!!!!Sign me,Mimi......A professional singer in the making"
2,Also Disappointed with Live at the Greek,"I thought I was the only one who could possibly be disappointed with Josh Groban's latest CD! All of his CD's are truly beautiful and the music is simply great. While I wasn't exactly thrilled with the lyrics in some songs on ""Closer"" it still was an excellent album. However, Groban's voice is unfortunately good then bad then okay in this concert. The lack of continuity makes the DVD difficult to watch also. I heard the nasal sounds in his voice and it was very hard to take. I'm sure there are many reasons for this but with the cost of DVD's I just have to be selective. I received this one was a birthday gift and was very grateful that the giver, my daughter, watched it with me. Afterward she returned it for something else. I hope Josh Groban takes care of his voice. His singing is truly beautiful. It just wasn't very good this time."
1,"""Live at the Greek"" DVD+CD are Terrible","Before adding my review about the ""Live at the Greek DVD,"" I wanted to check out some reviews here. Everyone who have a 3-5 star review talked about being AT the concerts and how great Groban was. HELLO!! This is the review site for the DVD+CD!! That's why people are talking about what they heard and saw on the DVD.I really don't care what goes on at other concerts or for that matter what went on at this one. What I cared about is that I bought this DVD set and it was beyond disappointing. Groban's voice was so bad I couldn't believe it either. Visually it was annoying. When you're AT a concert, you don't see all this. But here it is on DVD for all to see.This was not a worthy second concert by Josh Groban. I have the first one and it is spectacular. So now he wants to do other things....Let him. I'll be buying other music. Something where the singer doesn't sound nasal. Hmmmm. That shouldn't be hard to do."
2,PBS's Josh Groban Concert,"While I do have all of Josh Groban's music, I decided not to buy ""Live at the Greek."" My sister did buy the DVD set through a very big pledge with her local PBS station and she loaned it to me. I watched the concert DVD and was startled by Groban's voice!! This was in the first few minutes of the concert. He was nasal and often had problems in many songs that he had previously done so beautifully. While I do acknowledge that this concert was ""LIVE"", the first concert was live also and it was excellent. Regardless of the reason, I decided not to buy it for myself. It just wasn't very good."
1,Hopefully it doesn't get WORSE than this!,"I can't help but notice that one of the Spotlight Reviews was written in OCTOBER which was BEFORE the Greek Concert DVD/cd set was even released for purchase (December). Obviously from some concert follower, you know....one of the SCREAMERS! Another obvious fact, now that people have their DVD's in their homes to actually listen to it, it's not exactly making anyone happy. It didn't for me, so I returned it. As did many, many others."
2,What I heard on the Greek,"I can only state what I heard while listening the first time to my DVD of ""Live at the Greek,"" and it wasnt' Josh Groban's beautiful voice. Not all the time anyway, not even close. There were moments of the greatness that I used to admire but it was hard to stay watching since the difficult parts are in the beginning. Since I couldn't care less what others have to say, and still don't, this is MY review. It could have been filmed better with less views of screaming women and waving arms. That was VERY stupid. It could have been sung better by Josh Groban himself since they had TWO nights to film it. That is, of course, if his voice isn't permanently nasal and strained. All in all I'm disappointed with my DVD. Don't know at this time if I'll keep it but it isn't enjoyable when you have to skip to the good parts."
2,Josh isn't magical at the Greek theatre,"Josh Groban definitely has a new look but not an improved sound. I don't know what led to the problems but the production crew needs to go back and fix it. Groban can't afford to present another poor performance or he'll definitely lose me for one. The DVD is really poorly done. Why didn't anyone in the editing room catch the voice issues? That a few poor sounding songs were included is puzzling to me. I bought all of his CD's including ""Closer,"" even though I wasn't in love with it. Hope Josh doesn't grow so much that he loses his voice. It's really the magical part of any Josh Groban concert."
2,Poorly Done and Quite Disappointing,"I also was very disappointed with Josh Groban's Greek concert. It was very poorly done and I found the camera and sound annoying too. But the bottom line is really Josh Groban and his voice. Like others, I don't care WHY he sounds so bad. I only care about the fact that I got stuck with this turkey after trusting that I would have a DVD worth watching and listening to. ""Live at the Greek"" was neither."
2,Josh Groban's Voice isn't Great anymore,"With Live at the Greek we now have a newer performer in Josh Groban. Sad to say it's at the cost of his voice. Josh Groban the piano player, solo drummer, leather pants wearer, and guy full of insipid banter. Looks pretty dull and eventually you can't be fooled by the fact that Josh Groban the singer is less than what he's been in such wonderful past performances as his first CD. Even ""Closer"" was somewhat of a disappointment, with the dark songs written by Groban himself. Don't quit your day job, Josh! It is disappointing but somehow predictable that Groban would sell out to the dazzling special effects. He better do something fast, because from the looks of it, the customers aren't too happy with all of this."
1,Groban wears out his welcome at the Greek,"Maybe it's because our Public Television station is showing Josh Groban's concert AGAIN, begging for change AGAIN. Or perhaps it's because Groban is so miserable during this concert. Actually, it's both. I saw it the first time in December. We're getting cheap commercials for ""Closer"" and ""Live at the Greek"" during regular programming. While I loved and bought all of Josh Groban's prior records, the Greek just wore down my last nerve. Trying to get through it when his voice was congested took all my enthusiasm away. Groban has grown up and gone in a different direction. So have I."
2,Not Very Good,"Josh Groban's second live concert was not very good at all. I didn't know what to expect because I didn't see any reviews before I bought it. However, while watching Josh Groban I just couldn't see it through to the end. His voice is not good at all."
2,Not Josh Groban's Best,"This was not Josh Groban's finest hour (or two hours with pledge breaks). The fine young singer has tremendous potenttial still and I'm sure there will be many years of successful music. I won't be adding this concert to the first. That was the performance that made Josh a mega-star practically overnight. Perfect sound, tremendous vocal quality. This second effort is missing everything that we saw in the first. Whats in the future? I'll wait and see. I'm still hopeful."
2,His Second Concert on PBS,"I watched Josh Groban's second PBS concert over the weekend and was very disappointed. On some vocals his voice was poor, and the ""Greek"" is definitely not the place to record a concert for packaging to a mass audience. Odd filming and poor recording don't help either. I have a big collection of Josh Groban's work. This concert won't be added. However, I'm looking forward to future offerings."
2,"Bought the first, Didn't buy the Greek","I bought Josh Groban's first concert DVD set two years ago after seeing it on TV and have loved it ever since. I too have all of his CD's, including his latest ""Closer."" So I was all prepped to love ""Live at the Greek"" with as much gusto. I'm sorry to say that the concert wasn't interesting for me at all. I think that Josh's voice problems were just too much for me to handle. With such a tremendous voice, Josh should really protect it. Outdoor concerts may sound great to those who are there (and busy screaming) but it doesn't work for Josh Groban on a DVD. I also was disappointed that he repeated so many of the selections from the first concert and they weren't done very well this time. He actually does have newer material! Anyway this concert was not worth my buying. So I didn't buy it. No regrets."
2,"Very little to enjoy in ""Greek""","I won't be keeping my ""Live at the Greek"" DVD and Cd. I saw the DVD for the first time yesterday, when I played it for friends visiting for Christmas. A couple of friends who also like Groban remarked immediately on how different he sounded and looked. It was so bad that I turned it off after the first few minutes. Whatever Josh Groban is doing or not doing to have such a bad effect on his voice, should be stopped. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is because he wasn't completely awful. (I would give that to people like Britney Spears if I wanted to waste my time). Regardless, I'm not keeping it."
2,I thought I was alone!,"I bought Josh Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" DVD and was shocked also at the degradation of his voice. I thought I was the only one who heard it, but then I came here and read the reviews.I hope Josh can recover and get the beautiful quality back. What he really needs is a smaller indoor theater for his concerts AND to never film the ones outdoors again. I think he is affected by the outdoor changes too much because it definitely affects his voice.I didn't enjoy the concert because of this. Also, this concert wasn't really for ""Closer"" as it was constantly advertised on TV. There were a lot of songs from his first concert. And I loved the first one too. It was wonderful and I enjoyed every minute of it. It was stunning. But Josh really needs to take a look back and PLEASE not do this again."
2,"Josh Groban, Live at the Greek","I watched Josh Groban's concert on PBS and taped it to watch again afterward. What happened? Josh seemed to think we would prefer someone different and different he is! With a Rock, Pop, Alternative, Classical mix that didn't seem to work, Josh belted out his vocals with lots of rock star attitude. That's unfortunate because the one thing that set Josh apart from anyone else on the planet, his gorgeous VOICE, wasn't profiled. Josh Groban the ""performer,"" with popping overhead lights and things projected on a huge background screen were annoying distractions. Lucia Micarelli was beautiful and performed perfectly, a reminder of what Josh Groban used to be. He sounds good in a few songs but not so in others. I won't be buying this concert. Hopefully whatever he does next will focus on his voice and leave out the circus."
2,Live at the Greek,"I'm definitely disappointed with my DVD-CD set. I bought it before I saw the concert on television. That was a big mistake. This is Classical, Pop, Rock, all mixed together in one big confusing mixture. Groban sounds very diffrent from anything I've heard in the past including his first CD and Closer. For me, none of it works. I'm very sad to say this because it was a terrific experience to listen to his voice."
2,"Sorry, I had to ""Let Go""","Josh Groban didn't ""Raise me Up"" and my spirits were so dampened I can ""Remember When It Rained"" and became very sad. I'm happy I live in ""America"" and ""Believe"" that even ""Caruso"" had a bad day. I don't think they recorded him when he was at his worse, they way they did Josh Groban at the Greek. Although I am disheartened, I won't slash off my ear the way ""Vincent"" Van Gogh did. Josh, ""You Raise Me Up"" with your beautiful music, but this time, I had to let go."
1,"Didn't Like It, Didn't Enjoy It","The PBS station in our city is now showing Josh Groban's concert again in yet another pledge drive. I'm sure it's because PBS lost big money and hasn't been able to pawn this poorly made concert off on anyone with good hearing. They didn't hook me in this time (I got the first one through a major pledge).Wow, looks like the overwhelming majority of reviews here agree with me."
1,"Yes, Josh Groban has a Different Type of Audience",And I couldn't way it better or with more finesse than the person who wrote the review beneath this one.Case closed.
2,Josh Groban's Metamorphis,"I loved everything that Josh Groban did up to ""Live at the Greek."" I have all of the CD's and first concert too and absolutely loved them because Groban's voice was so beautiful. I didn't care for ""Live at the Greek,"" and didn't buy it mostly because his voice is so congested and nasal. I saw the concert on tv and didn't watch it through. Not exactly what I expected but the metamorphis isn't why I rated the concert so low. It's just that most of his vocals were truly bad. His laid back appearance and banter with the audience were okay. He could fly across the stage in a tutu and I wouldn't care if his voice was good."
2,This CAN'T be Josh Groban!,What happened to Josh? What happened to his voice?? His concert at the Greek definitely isn't what I expected. I'm just very confused that he sings everything so different.
1,Horrid! Run away as fast as you can!,"Bottom line, buy the first Josh Groban DVD (originally shown on PBS). This new 'thing' is just plain BAD. I got uncomfortable watching it for Josh seems to be burning himself out. Its just too much: teetering on hysterical and a complete mess. Someone is pushing this young man too hard, perhaps it is Josh himself."
1,"Why you SHOULD Buy ""Live at the Greek""","I watched my DVD of ""Live at the Greek"" for the umpteenth time, so last night I decided to write down all the reasons why YOU should buy it too!! Here they are: (1) Ummmm, (2) Duhhhhh, (3) Where's the coffee??, (4) Maybe if I took a little break, (5) I KNOW it'll come to me!, (6) Darn, I didn't take notes!, (7) I'll be right back, (8) Playing the DVD again, (9) It's loading in my NEW DVD player, (10) Oh yeah, I forgot! Uh......NEVER MIND!!"
2,Josh Groban Live at the Greek,This concert set won't be making my collection. It's simply a trash cousin to the first. Actually there's very little to compare to the first except that Josh Groban was there. I just found this second site. All the major reviews are at the other site (yes there's two).
2,A Prediction for the Greek,"I got Josh Groban's Greek concert as a Christmas gift. My husband immediately said it's okay with him if I return it because it's so poor. I read about 15 reviews before posting because I thought I'd get creamed for giving it only a 2 star review. But as I can tell, I'm not alone. That's very bad for a rising talented singer like Josh Groban. I truly hope that his next release is better. It would be great if he gets back to his roots and drop the pop star routine but I don't think so. He's been touring this concert for at least a year now and I see he's got a full schedule next year. That's a shame but it's also his decision. He has (had) a uniquely beautiful voice. Now I can see he's just a mediocre Pop singer. It doesn't take a fortune teller to figure this one out."
1,The Best and Worse from Josh Groban,"Anything that Josh Groban did up to ""Live at the Greek,"" was superb!! I loved everything on his first CD with ""My Prayer"" (duo with Charlotte Church) being the epitome of a perfect blending of voices. Okay, I'm not getting to the reason why I gave this concert one star. Josh Groban's vocals are very poor in some places, strong in others, then faltering in yet others. Gee, does the Josh Groban production team really think we want to see Groban as anything else but the perfect vocalist that he was in other things? I don't think so!"
2,What Happened??,"omg!! This is Josh?? My mom bought the Greek album set for me two weeks ago and I just watched it today. I could cry!! What's happened to him and why? I forgot I had the concert until my mom told me about a progrm on Arts & Entertainment this morning. That's when I saw Josh and remembered I had the concert!! I ran to put it in the player and saw someone totally different. We both said the same thing, it isn't Josh. Then we realized it was. How horrible. It makes me so sad because he was so darling and a terrific singer. Since I'm taking voice and going to a performing arts school, I've been a fan because Josh is young too. He needs to get a voice coach and go back to his exercises. I feel so bad doing this but his DVD is really bad. Or maybe I'm just outgrowing him. Dunno. All I really know is that I didn't like this DVD."
3,"Not Great, Pretty Average for a Pop Singer","Yes, Josh Groban was nasal in the first few minutes of the concert. No he wasn't terrific, wonderful, etc. From what I could see on the PBS concert it surely wasn't a ""Great Performance"" among the usual PBS lineup of concerts. It was average. Some songs were good, a few very bad or poor. Groban looked like every dressed-down Pop singer I've ever seen with the exception of Elton John who loves to glitter it up. I loved Groban's first concert and bought the DVD set. I passed this one up because of what Groban has become, and that's a mediocre Pop singer. I can't afford to buy music because I love one song on the disc. I just dumped a big bagfull of those at the Goodwill store. ""Live at the Greek"" was okay to watch on TV, but I wouldn't put my money on it."
2,"The ""Greek"" is Disappointing for me also","Although it's painful for me to agree also, but I found the Greek concert by Josh Groban disappointing also. His one true talent is his voice, his beautiful voice. Not the paino, Not the drums....couldn't care less. His beautiful voice is not quality all the time and it is painful to hear. I sincerely hope Groban understands this and pulls back on the concerts. Otherwise the live audiences will be the only ones he has left, and that doesn't sell millions of CD's."
1,Not Josh Groban's Shining Moment,"I hate to think that this is the turning point of Josh Groban's career. In just a short span of a a few years we saw a young man with a golden voice turn into a stage performer. In some people it works, with Josh Groban it doesn't. This is a jumble of genres: Pop, Rock, quasi-Classical. The filming is frantic at times and I was left feeling dizzy. The biggest issue for me was Josh Groban's voice and the radically changed performances of previously recorded songs. There's just too much to mention here. Suffice it to say that I won't be buying this concert DVD-CD set."
2,"Disappointed with ""Live at the Greek""","Josh Groban has talent beyond compare and a voice so beautiful that I can't help but feel major disappointment with this second concert. I bought both of his concerts and there's definitely a difference in his voice. Where the first (2002) was beautiful in every way, the ""Greek"" is flawed. Groban's voice is strained and noticably nasal in some vocals. I don't buy the ""defective DVD"" excuse. That would be laughable if it weren't for the fact that I paid $29 for this concert DVD/CD set. If the vocal weaknesses weren't disappointing enough, I also have issues with the new arrangements for his standards like ""Canto Alla Vita,"" the song he previously did in his first concert with the Coors. Josh goes to the keyboards and plays an introduction that sounds like scratching your fingernails across a chalkboard! What was that?! The staging, lighting, stuff projected on screens behind him were just annoying distractions."
1,Most disappointing,"I was really impressed by the song Remember in the movie Troy. So when I saw this dvd/cd with it, I quickly bought it even though what I wanted was the studio recording of Troy. I figured that a live version can't be that bad as Josh has a gorgeous voice. After just one play, I returned it to the store and changed it for something else. Josh sounds really nasal here. Perhaps he had the flu? Then they should have postponed the recording. I cannot sit through this concert without comparing it to the previous which wasexcellent. Josh, back to basics please."
1,A Shockingly Bad Performance by Josh Groban,"I couldn't believe it! From the first few minutes of watch Josh Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" concert I was in shock. The PBS concert was so badly performed by Groban I knew I wouldnt be buying it. From the looks of the majority of reviews here, I was one of the lucky ones because I didn't have to stand in a Return line. Groban has been out of the public eye for two years since his last televised concert, but has he changed!!! Looks like Hollywood has gotten to him and so has a belief that the fans would stay regardless of what poorly made music he puts out. Well, the young guy is learning a valuable lesson. I didn't buy it and so went the rest of the fans. I sincerely hope that Groban goes back to what made him so popular and that's his VOICE. All the rest is just fooolishness and it looks like no one else is buying it either."
2,Groban's Voice NOT Kissed by the Gods this Time,"The usually superior voiced Josh Groban didn't quite live up to his standards with ""Live at the Greek."" From the looks of it he also knew he wasn't quite able to hit the strong notes. His presence was stiff and he looked very uncomfortable in the first few minutes. It's unfathomable that the professionals (?) in charge of post-production for this concert didn't edit it better. With so many non-professional listeners catching the nasal strains, where were they? Oh well, that's not really the issue now. There are a few who will buy the ""Greek,"" warts and all. It's their money. Mine will wait until there's a better CD. If not, I'm that much the richer."
2,Groban could do better,"I am one of the few people who did not buy ""Live at the Greek"", mainly because I saw it on PBS in December and didn't care for it. Groban did not sound very well and his performance at this concert was not very good. I have his first concert DVD which was also recorded live, so it's really that the ""Greek"" concert is not that good. I've seen many of the guest shots and with all of them, and his recordings, he sounds fine. He just didn't in this latest offering. Groban definitely could do better work than this."
2,"Unhappy with my ""Greek"" DVD","I'm not sure if I can return this but after watching my DVD and listening to the CD, I'm not happy at all. When Groban first started his concerts I heard it was for ""Closer,"" his most recent CD. Well, it's not. It's a compilation of mostly older songs with only five from Closer. Groban sounds ill on three and his voice falters on two songs. He looks as poor as he sounds too. Didn't anyone tell him that it was being filmed for a mass audience? Sure did because he acknowledges it at the end. I have the first concert DVD and it's what I expect to get when I pay $29. ""Greek"" isn't. Since I'm not tone deaf, I can hear all the problems that trouble Groban with this concert and I think they should recall it."
2,"Difficult to watch ""Live at the Greek""","From the first minute to the last, ""Live at the Greek"" was difficult to watch. Just the opposite from ""Josh Groban in Concert"" Groban's first live concert. That one was done just two years ago, and it was so beautiful I couldn't take my eyes off it. So what's different now? Everything but most importantly Josh Groban is different. He looks, sounds and performs differently from anything I've seen him in before. None of this would be at issue if his voice were okay. It isn't. Without his beautiful voice, Josh Groban is just another dull entertainer. He doesn't have the glittering personality to hold the home crowd. I've been to live concerts and of course the experience is different from watching a DVD at home. I didn't buy the DVD either and I'm happy I didn't. Looks like many who did are not happy campers."
2,Josh Groban's Greek Concert,"I could hardly bear to watch Josh Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" concert when it was on PBS for free. I'm certainly not going to pay money to buy a DVD of it for $25.00. I've read a few of the reviews here and they're pretty much on track with what I thought too. Groban was okay in some songs but nasaly and strained in many others. His voice and appearance were poor. It seems that the PBS recording of one of his concerts was an afterthought and slapped together deal. At the end of our PBS stations showing, they made an announcement that Groban would be performing his concert in our nearby city. If that had been said for his first concert, I would have gladly bought a ticket. With this concert I won't even buy a disc. Now that Groban has dumbed-down to suit the concert audience, I can move on. When Groban first started I was thrilled that I had someone with a lovely voice that I could actually listen to. No longer. Seeing the man that he has become, I'm just sadly moving on."
2,So this is what the Concerts are like!,"I am so thankful to PBS to provide me with a second Josh Groban concert. It saved me so much money! I watched Groban's concert last night on a rerun and it pretty much helped me make up my mind. Unfortunately he's touring in my city this month but fortunately for me, I won't be wasting my money on a ticket. Heck, I even erased my videotape of this disappointing concert! Groban's performance is disappointing beyond description. I leave him to the lions (the ranting, screaming females). Yuk"
2,Returned my copy too,"I bought Josh Groban's Greek concert last month. I didn't see any reviews or articles before buying mine so I had no idea that Josh had changed so much. I was truly shocked at how much he's changed. Appearance and voice-wise, Josh just isn't the same. It's not simply the voice but that's really his only true talent (any kid can play the drums and piano, we don't buy Josh for that). He truly ""had"" a knock you out of your seat voice that wasn't just powerful but beautiful as well. Notice how I used the past tense. Unfortunately this concert did not portray Josh in a good light with his voice so badly done. I took my copy of the Greek back to the store too. It just was so hard to even hear his voice."
2,Josh Groban's Problems during Greek,It's quite obvious that Josh Groban was having a few problems while performing at the Greek Theatre. He attempted to sing while his voice was not up to par. I just hope he gets professional help with his voice issues before he attempts to record anything else. I watched his concert on PBS and didn't buy the DVD set because of it. Perhaps next time. Hopefully next time. Otherwise they'll be very few left to sing his praises.
2,"Not much to smile about with the ""Greek""","I didn't see ""Live at the Greek"" on PBS or anything. I just got my DVD yesterday and couldn't wait to see it. WHAT HAPPENED TO Josh??? I can't believe it's the same guy. The smile I planted on my face when I got the package soon faded when I heard his voice. Ohhhh. That beautiful voice, what happened?? A couple of friends told me they thought it was bad and that was before I got mine. I thought they were nuts, but I see what they mean. He doesn't even look as cute. What's with all the screaming women and why do we have to see them?? It made me so miserable seeing this stuff and not seeing or hearing my Josh the way he was."
1,Josh Was Truly Lousy at the Greek,"I really don't know what Josh Groban is doing with his career, nor do I care. I only know that I blew my money on this DVD and it is a miserable thing to watch. In at least half of it he is noticably nasal and very strained. In all of it, he looks bad too.Never again."
3,Just Three Stars in My Eyes,"Oh how I wish I saw five stars but I honestly think that Josh Groban's voice problems are bringing down his performance at the Greek. Yes, it sounds nasaly. It doesn't help that there's only a few songs from ""Closer"" and two of them have the nasal sound. Josh Groban's voice is much better in a theatre where he can gain control over it and the audience roar is down to a manageble level."
2,Lackluster Vocals by Josh Groban,"In ""Live at the Greek"" Josh Groban seems to think being loud is okay even if the voice isn't. In the first few minutes of this concert his voice warbles and strains to come out nasaly! Gee, and we're supposed to buy this?? I taped it off the PBS showing and have taped over it since. To me, sadly, it's not even worth the price of a video tape. I can't imagine how I'd feel if I actually bought the DVD. Well, I can tell from the reviews that many wish they hadn't."
5,Praise God! It's finally here!,"I can't even begin to explain how excited I am that this DVD is here! I am an absolute diehard Grobanite to the core, and so I am so happy to see that this DVD is being released (and for such a reasonable price too!) Josh Groban has the voice of a GOD!Thank you, Josh...And thank you, Amazon for selling this DVD!"
1,The Greek is a Career Killer for Groban,"Count me among the many who returned my DVD of Josh Groban's Greek Concert.It lacked quality in both Groban's vocals (after all, he IS a singer), and everything else.Hopefully Groban will avoid the outdoor concert venue like the plague. It destroys his already strained voice."
5,Pure Magic,"To me Josh Groban has to be one of the best voices in music history. His classic style is a soothing balm from the plastic cookie-cutter pop artists we hear today. It's really a shame that he hasn't been nominated for his work...if I'm correct. Please correct me if I'm wrong with that. ;)The DVD's and CD's are a guarenteed best buy! Every penny you spend on him is definately worth it!The ONLY problem I have with Josh is he's been around for several years but has only released two CD's and DVD's. Much slower than the typical artist. But if the long wait equals the quality of the music, then I am more than happy to wait. :)"
3,Josh- What You SEE Is What You Get,"This glimpse of Josh Groban at The Greek provides a look at a multi-talented performer who belies his age and skills. One of this generation's most prolific voices, who can mix and match pop, opera and virtually any other musical genre, nonetheless, he has a CD, and not a video aura about him. The video is disappointing and even boring at times. His hidden talents revealed, playing the drums and organ, can't offset his lackluster showmanship.Skip the DVD and buy the CD. It's better than average listening but below average to watch. He's no Vegas act."
3,Josh Groban Live at the the Greek,"It sounds like Josh Groban has a cold and because he chose to sing anyway- his voice sounded nasal. The acoustics of a singer's sinus makes a really major difference, and singers who have had more experience then Josh know to cancel their performances if they have a cold. By now, he probably has learned, and future performances will show his true talent again. It looked like he was having fun and his audience also looked pleased. Last day of his tour- and close to his home- he still should have cancelled though."
2,"I can't recommend ""Live at the Greek""","I wanted to love this concert as much as I loved everything else Josh Groban has done. I bought all the previous CD's and his first concert DVD/CD combo. But after watching this concert on PBS this past month, I was just too shocked to even think of buying it.Josh Groban's singing was very poor. His voice sounded sick practically from the beginning. This concert had all the trappings of a Rock concert too, but without much real excitement generated from its star.If it weren't for Lucia Micarelli, I probably wouldn't have much positive to say at all. She was truly spectacular!However, Josh Groban needs to go back to the drawing board. Hopefully the next time he releases a concert DVD it's when he actually sounds good."
2,A disappointing performance by an amazing singer,"I am a huge Josh Groban Fan and personally, have been moved by his music. I feel so guilty as this is the first time that I am publicly writing anything about Josh and am going to criticize an amazing artist. Plan and simple, I honestly believe that Josh's voice was strained in this concert and unfortunately PBS chose the wrong time to make a recording. In songs like Alejate, he sounded like a billy-goat when he was singing the refrain. If you listen to Josh Groban in Concert and compare it to this DVD concert, you will definitely hear the difference and understand where I am coming from. However, I hope people don't judge his vocal ability by this one concert as I have heard him perform live many times and can honestly say that he has one of the best voices that I have ever heard, period."
2,The Greek bears no resemblance,"to anything Josh Groban has ever done. I have both concert DVD's and the Greek is absolutely inferior to any CD, DVD or personal appearance he has made. Josh Groban's voice is poor and nasal in enough songs for me to give this rating without a second thought. With his first concert, Groban's voice was marvelous! The sets were beautiful and visually stunning. In the ""Greek"" we get none of it. While I don't expect perfection, I do expect a concert I can enjoy without shuddering at a nasaly performer."
2,Definitely not Josh Groban's best,"I bought this DVD-CD combo of Josh Groban's concert and it does pain me to say that this is not the best work he's done. It doesn't come close. I'm such a big fan and I never thought I'd be giving such a review but here it is. For those of us (millions who do not attend the concerts), his appearance and stage presence is a big change. However, my problems with the concert and not with that, it's the sound of his voice. There's a few songs that I can hear the nasal tone and instead of that beautiful quality, it's simply not there. This is, of course, just my opinion. I bought it and I'll keep it because there are some moments of enjoyment. There's just not enough for me for write a glowing review."
2,I'm not the only one!,"I thought I was the only fan who was unhappy with my DVD of ""Life at the Greek""!! This makes me so sad because I love Josh's voice. Since I'm also studying voice he was a role model. Now Josh seems to be just another rock star now that he's let his voice go for sure. I can hear the strains and my teacher would too. Josh just needs to re-train his voice to get the quality back. He truly sounds better in his first concert."
1,"I bought it, I can't Recommend it","Like many others, I have all of Josh Groban's stuff. I bought this one too, but ""Live at the Greek"" is so disappointing I can't recommend it. If anyone is thinking of buying it believing that it's the same Josh Groban, you may be unpleasantly surprized. I was. I bought it, I regret it, I can't recommend it."
3,needs new fans,"I hope josh rocks out on his next album so none of his so called ""fans"" write any more crap reviews!Live music is just that--live!If you want perfect,buy the album!Closer is perfect!I'd love to hear most of the people on this site try to sing this stuff,it's not easy,I know,I sing!This guy is awesome.You all take this way too serious.Relax and how about some constructive criticizm?Oh,and by the way,is 27.00 really that much money?"
5,A Voice that is a rare treat,"The DVD is confirmation that the Closer concert we attended last summer was absolutely the best we had ever been to in our 40+ years! What a joy to not only listen to Josh Groban's music, but now to be able to see him perform again."
4,Singer and fan who understands,"I bought this locally and I admit Josh's voice is not the best I've ever heard on this DVD however I have sung (not in front of thousands) just hundreds of people and I can tell you that no one's voice is perfect all the time and your voice can do contrary to what you are trained sometime. I do think people are being glass half empty here. To the person who's going to move on to the next ""boy wonder"", good luck. I know in my lifetime he is without a doubt the best voice to come along that I can remember. I would never forget a voice this good. If I am in a public place and I hear his songs I still stop and think ""WOW"". I gets me everytime. His new CD is different but in a good way. FYI-I am not a Grobanite, but I am qualified to know amazing talent when I hear it!Give the guy a break, no one is perfect not even opera stars that choose to remain in the box!"
1,Josh sounds better in a closed Theatre,"His first concert was ""Live"" also but the sound was so perfect that I didn't believe it was a live recording. The Pasadena concert CD was so clear and Josh's voice so vibrant, it pretty much justifies the multi-million dollar sales. The Greek was not good for recording his second concert with all the sound problems and of course the affect it had on Josh's voice. I bought this DVD and CD also but it will be going back to the store. I just can't bear to hear his voice sounding so nasal. Maybe next time, but I'll be more cautious to watch it before I buy. Our music store is a 24 mile drive, another annoyance."
1,A Messy Turn by Groban,This whole productionis messy. Haphazard vocals by Groban (eek! Nasal and poor). The filming will give you vertigo. I'm only happy about one thing........I saw it on PBS for free and didn't waste my money on this DVD set.
2,"Sadly Disappointed with ""Greek"" too!!!","All these poor reviews are devastating. It's even worse because I can't do better either! ""Live at the Greek"" is just that bad and Josh sounds that weak. Oh well, back to the drawing board. I hope Josh's next CD is beautiful. Since his CD's aren't recorded outdoors (hurts his voice) around all those loud people (UGH), I'm sure it will be. I'll wait and buy that one!!"
2,"Josh Rocks, PBS Sings the Blues","Yes, Josh has taken a rock turn in his newest concert (even playing drums too). Thankfully I watched it on PBS because that's when I decided not to buy this one. A changed Josh Groban is reflected in the poor album sales. All other Josh Groban CD's hit platinum sales this release is not even on the charts, so it looks as if I'm not the only one who isn't buying and for good reason. I have the first CD and Closer. They're terrific. In this concert Josh Groban is pushed to the limit and his beautiful voice suffers."
1,Disappointing Second Concert by Josh Groban,"I challenge Josh Groban to sing better than Josh Groban did at the Greek theatre!! (How's THAT for a challenge!). That would be pretty cool since he really does a disappointing turn here. All he has to do is match his own voice, the one we heard in all his prior CD's, personal appearances and first concert DVD. I bought all the other ones. I won't be getting the ""Greek"" concert."
2,"Josh Groban ""Live at the Greek""","omg I thought it was just me!! I LOVE Josh Groban but when I saw his newest concert I was shocked at how bad Josh sounded. His beautiful voice was so bad that I couldn't watch any more than the first half hour. Unless you've been going to the concerts to see how he has transformed himself, you're also in for a shock because Josh looks different too. I just think the whole concert package was disappointing. I'm giving it two stars because I can't bear to give it one. I hope this change isn't permanent because I'll just not be able to buy Josh's songs anymore."
2,The NEW Josh Groban??,"We have a totally NEW Josh Groban at the Greek, a revamped warbler attempting to look comfortable in his new Rocker skin. Too bad for the fans, it doesn't work. Josh Groban comes off sounding bad, nasal in fact and the sloppy laid-back dude comes across as ....a sloppy laid-back dude. I didn't buy the DVD and it looks like many previous customers aren't coming back too. I also believe Groban can resolve his voice issues if he also resolves his appearance issues. Maybe, maybe not. All I know is I won't jump to buy the next CD without hearing it first."
2,"Not Much to Recommend the ""Greek"" Concert","I bought Josh Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" concert a few days before Christmas and have watched it three times, thinking it would grow on me. Well, it hasn't. Groban's singing voice is strained and I heard it (like so many others) in the first few minutes. I'm young too so the updated clothing and casual manner are fine with me. I just wish Josh sounded better, especially on my favorite from ""Closer,"" the beautiful ""Mi Mancherai."" With only 8 songs from ""Closer"" on the DVD, I feel a big let down. I don't believe ""America"" is his style or range either. ""You Raise me Up"" is just another kind of ""To Where You Are."" I wish there were more new songs here like the gorgeous ""Per Te,"" that is sung very well. Well, wishes can't make it so and I'm not sure if I'll keep mine either."
1,Looking for the Perfect concert DVD??,"If you haven't heard Josh Groban in concert at all and you're looking for the perfect DVD/CD set you may want to pass up the ""Greek."" I would suggest that you buy ""Josh Groban in Concert,"" his first concert set. It was perfection and was a great showcase for Groban's impeccable voice. Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" has left many people (including me) incredibly disappointed. Even though it's only been two years it hasn't been a good two years for Josh. I bought both DVD sets and the difference is so obvious. So are the reviews by people who have seen them. Just compare the reviews (and overall grade) here to the reviews for Josh's first concert. But don't take my word for it. Most stores have a listening area where you can compare them for yourself. I couldn't listen to Greek for more than 30 minutes."
2,Won't be keeping Mine either,"The Greek DVD doesn't deserve to share shelf space with my other Josh Groban music (I have everything he did). Whatever the excuses, whatever the reasons, it's just not good. Nasaly? Congested? Strained? Yep, I heard it too. Josh Groban is the man with the beautiful voice. It was a big mistake to sell this one with the problems. I love Josh and because he's always so darned terrific, this one won't stay in my house."
2,Live at the Greek: Poorly Done,"I bought Josh Groban's latest concert, ""Live at the Greek"" to enjoy a second concert by one of my favorite Pop singers. Unbelievably, I couldn't bear to watch the first 30 minutes. I kept fast-forwarding hoping Groban would sound and look better. He didn't. Whatever he decided to do on his concert tour it certainly isn't much of ""Closer"" as advertised and it certainly isn't the quality that anyone should expect from any singer. His voice is so poor I just turned it off. I also determined it wasn't worth keeping and returned it to the store."
1,I'm neither Deaf nor Blind,"That's really good for me but not so good for Josh Groban. Since I can HEAR VERY WELL, thank you, I can also hear the nasal twang that brings Josh Groban's performance down. Buy it?? No way. I'm leaving it for the ""Loyal Fans."" I liked Josh Groban when he could actually sing but that was a very long two years ago. If I wanted nasal twang I'd buy Country....but that would hurt even more than this."
2,Heard the Problems with Groban's voice too,"Yes, I heard the nasal twang too. I heard it during the PBS concert also. Too bad because Josh Groban is really a terrific singer, just not this time. Since I don't buy music where the artist sounds so bad, I didn't buy this one. From the looks of it I made a very sound decision. I work too hard for my money to buy something that doesn't make me thoroughly happy."
1,"YEAH, INCREDIBLE","MAN I CAN'T BELIEVE THE DUNDERHEAD WHO GAVE THIS 5 STARS. ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. THE VERY ""LITTLE"" FLAWS INCLUDED A SINGER WHO WAS NASAL THROUGH 75% OF THE CONCERT. BE GOOD TO YOURSELF, SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,WOW!,"Josh is incredible in this concert!! What's up with all the bickering?? No need. Josh will always be mystifying. Since very few words can describe his voice, I'll stop at a few."
2,"Josh Groban, Live at the Greek","I didn't even think about it, I watched this concert knowing it would be beautiful. Well, it was okay. With the first concert I was plastered to my chair. With this concert I just wanted to get plastered! Okay?? For Josh Groban?? This doesn't happen. Well it did happen. It's still being televised on PBS stations, so my best advice is watch the concert before you buy this set. Make your own decision!"
2,This isn't my Josh,omg Josh what happened to your wonderful voice?? I just got my Greek dvd today and I can't believe it!! It has to be a mistake with the recording of that gorgeous voice. I'm shocked. This isn't my beautiful Josh. I blame the record people for this and not Josh. He's always wonderful.
2,"Unhappy with ""Live at the Greek"", so I returned it","Unlike ""Josh Groban in Concert,"" which was Groban's first concert before a live audience, Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" contained very little to make me happy. Within minutes of watching my new concert DVD, I was surprised by his new looks but that's not my biggest concern by far. Groban's voice was clear, then poor, strong, weak. I thought the bright spot was beautiful Lucia Micarelli on the violin. The remake of ""Canto Alla Vita"" left me speachless with disappointment. I grabbed the remote to turn down that screeching introduction and kept the sound low. Someone should have told Groban to leave perfection alone. The poor remakes of ""Alla Luce Del Sole,"" ""Vincent"" and ""Alejate,"" in this concert left me wondering WHY?? With all the issues I have, I decided it wasn't for me so it went back."
2,Too Many Problems at the Greek,"Josh Groban's ""Live at the Greek"" DVD just contained too many problems for me to enjoy. The most obvious one, of course, is his voice problems where he sounds really nasal. Then I can also add in that I didn't enjoy his new image and style. I can't understand why I still see advertisements on TV telling us that this is a tour of ""Closer."" The concert DVD has so many of his older songs and ones he did on the first concert. I agree that they weren't as good as the first. Groban couldn't improve on ""Alejate"" from the first concert it was so beautiful and he sang it so perfectly. Well, if this is what he's become, I'm out of it too. This DVD wasn't entirely bad, but bad enough for me to be angry with myself for buying it without a preview. Now I know I can listen at these websites before I buy. IF I every buy anything of Josh Groban's again, I'll check it out first. Right now, that's a big IF."
2,What Happened to Josh Groban?,"I just played my ""Live at the Greek"" DVD yesteday and I couldn't believe how poor his voice was! I also had guests over and they commented on how his voice was nasal in some songs and just poor in one other. It was so disappointing that I took it out and played the first concert DVD. Very noticable indeed! With the first concert we heard the beautiful tones of Josh Groban's voice and everything he sang. I believe this is only the span of two years between concerts. Lucky for me I bought it at Sam's and can get a refund. This one is going back to the store."
1,Josh is Wonderful in Concerts,My Josh is always terrific in concerts. I attended many so I know! They should get rid of the people who did this DVD and get David Foster back with Josh. Josh and David make beautiful music together
1,Josh Groban was AWFUL !!!!!!,"omg How on earth could anyone want us to spend our hard earned money on this AWFUL concert?!? Josh Groban was absolutely terrible. His voice was congested, nasaly, and lousy. What a big come-down from his earlier years when his voice was so good. As far as this concert, the constant views of fat stupid women jumping around and acting like they had a clue was really sad indeed. Looks like they had a few too many before leaving home. Making such fools of themselves for a man half their age....YUK.Then you have to look at the fact that Josh Groban sounded and looked so miserable.Only buy this DVD if you really love badly sung DVD's. Otherwise you'll be very disappointed."
1,Beautiful Performances by Josh Groban,"I loved every single track on ""Live at the Greek"". Each of the songs on the CD were beyond belief.1. Oceano2. Mi Mancherai (il postino)3. Mi Morena4. Canto Alla Vita5. Remember When It Rained6. Remember7. America8. Never Let GoThe DVD Track Listing is also terrific. Here Josh showed the world that he is changing and again his performances were beautiful. His musical guests were very good too.1. Oceano2. Per Te3. To Where You Are4. Mi Mancherai (il postino)5. Mi Morena6. Alejate7. Canto Alla Vita8. Nocturne/Bohemian Rhapsody (performed by Lucia Micarelli)9. Alla Luce Del Sole (special guest artist: Bela Fleck)10. My December11. Caruso12. Remember When It Rained13. Vincent (Starry, Starry Night)14. Remember15. You Raise Me Up16. America17. Never Let GoJosh will go on to show us where his career is going with the noticable changes. I for one will continue to be amazed by his performances. The audience obviously showed their love for him too."
2,I'M HOPEFUL FOR JOSH,"I'm hopeful that Josh Groban can recover his beautiful voice and make terrific music for years to come. I didn't like ""Live at the Greek,"" because of his voice problems so I didn't buy it. I heard it during the PBS televised concert. For other CD's that I bought my reviews on another site were glowing with words like ""wonderful, gorgeous, mezmerizing."" I want to be able to write that again. I read some of the reviews and it hurts to agree. But there it is. Warner Brothers should never have released this DVD or should recall it since so many people who bought it are unhappy."
2,JOSH GROBAN AT THE GREEK,Tedious and dissapointing. Groban seems to be in a fast pace marathon to prove how musically diverse he is. His first video was much better than this one!
2,Was Josh LIVE at the Greek?,"Yes, we know Josh was supposed to be LIVE at the Greek because that's the name of the concert, ""Josh Groban LIVE at the Greek."" We know the audience was lively because we heard the rumble of their voices and we know the choir was LIVE because they all waved their arms like tree limbs in a hurricane. But Josh certainly didn't seem very much alive and his performance was pretty much on life support when we heard a croaky, nasaly voice. Whatever happened to Josh's voice, I hope it improves before he cuts his next CD. Don't think I'll stay around for another croaky album."
4,Hearty,I watched this movie when I was in my teens and I enjoyed it. The quality of the movie is great.
1,Wrong Heartbeat,"I have twice notified Amazon that the picture included with this item is wrong - the response: No Change - stating nothing wrong - But the picture is of an UK actor named Nick Berry and it is from the British TV series Heartbeat which started in 1992. Now the actors listed for this product include John Ritter. John Ritter was never on the UK show - He may have made a movie or US TV show called Heartbeat, but to include a picture from a different show is misleading. I was hoping to find DVD's of the UK show - but at present I do not know exactly what they are selling or trying to sell.If the seller reads this they need to clarify what it is they are trying to sell. And, I know what I am talking about - I watch this show, in England, daily. Nick Berry (pictured) played PC Nick Rowan from 1992 - 1998. Please make correction ASAP.TAD"
4,Danielle Steel's 'Heartbeat',"This is a must have for any Danielle Steele fan. This man, who is divorced, and has shared custody of the kids meets this woman, who is newly divorced (and discovers she's pregnant with her first husband) start out as neighbors, then friends and wind up together."
4,Excellent but non-consensual book on the principle of Upaya,"This is an academic book, which focuses on the idea of ""skillful means"" (upaya) in Buddhism. Very broadly speaking, the idea is that the teachings of Buddhism are intended as means to an end, the end being the liberation of all sentient beings from suffering (dukkha). The book argues that the idea of Upaya, though more prominent in Mahayana Buddhism, was in fact present and central even in early Abbhidharma-period Buddhism. Moreover, the book explores the idea of Upaya in other periods of Buddhism, such as Nagarjuna's teachings and Chan/Zen Buddhism. The foreward by the excellent Zen scholar T. P. Kasulis is also interesting. However the book is not for the general audience and will only be useful to readers familiar with the history of Buddhism and its primary schools and teachers."
4,Very Solid,"Altogather very good, although ""Wagon Wheel"" is a rip off of Bob Dylan's ""Ride Me Mama"" that was never released. Not to take anything away from them, their version is excellent. Good music for any fan of something real."
3,Old Crow Medicine Show,These guys are too young to sound like old hillbilies. I was looking for a little bit more current genre.
2,Nashville ruined these guys.,"If you can track down some of their independent albums, check those out instead. They used to explode with energy. This is polished Nashville CRAP! Before they sold out, I'd compare them with the great Gus Cannon. Looks like they'll soon be on tour with The Dixie Chicks or possibly Creed. Corporate music has ruined another band. Buy something else."
1,Ha! Ha! Ha!,"Did another reviewer mention ""Man of Constant Sorrow? I think they did. That should tell you how commercial this crap is. I agree with the earlier review. Sold out. Buy some Uncle Dave Macon instead."
4,Country music fan,"The more I listen, the better I like it. Very hillbilly, but the songs are catchy and stay in your head."
3,They're no Avett Brothers,"I became familiar with these guys after hearing them on Pandora. Wagon Wheel is an excellent song, and others (notably Tell It To Me) are just about as intriguing. However, they're no Avett Brothers! They're one trick pony sound is fine if that's what you're wanting, but they're not versatile."
5,New Old Time Music,"I enjoyed the O.C.M.S. very much. I have been dismayed for the last decade or so about the homogenization of pop music. I can't tell country from rock or rock from hip hop. Along comes the O.C.M.S. and I can hear something that stands out from the rest and is a lot of fun to boot. I realize that their music is not ground breaking or visionary but it is not self absorbed or annoying like most of the so called folk or singer songwriter crap that is dominating the adult alternative market (which is where the program directors are probably pigeonholing them) these days.If you just want to hear some great goodtime music to have a hillbilly party with, pick up O.C.M.S. crack open a bottle of Jim Beam and grab your honey.P.S. I can not find any Bob Dylan song called ""Wagon Wheel"", and I've searched long and hard. What up with dat?"
4,Not what you would expect,Just discovered Old Crow Medicine Show and I am very impressed by their work. I am not a country or blue grass fan typically. But I really enjoy the music.
3,Good But....,"I got this after wearing all the bits off Carry Me Back. It's good, and has some great lyrics and picking, but not quite up to the work on the later album. Still recommended."
5,Superb,"""This is the story of how Dartmouth college came into being more than two hundred years ago in what was then literally a frontier wilderness -- and of how it survived to emerge in this century as one of the nation's outstanding institutions of higher learning, as well as a place of rare beauty. It's a story laced with the stuff of legend.Remnants and reminders of the past abound -- in buildings, landscapes, paintings, monuments, and memorials. There is even a room in Baker library furnished to re-create a sense of the academic necessities and niceties with which the learned and pious founders of the colleve proclaimed their civilizing purposes....But these metaphoric milestones cannot tell of the dramas they represent in Dartmouth's extraordinary saga.""Hardback with dustcover: green cloth over boards with a sewn binding. 250 pp, index, illustrations."
5,Still an old favorite,"I know this is an old book (from the 80's) but it's still one of my favorites.The recipes are quick and very good, just like you'd expect from Martha.One recipe I use quite often is for leg of lamb and roasted potatoes - it sounds fancy, tastes delicious, but surprisingly simple.And of course it's beautifully photographed.I often give this book as a gift."
4,Quick and Quality Meals,"This is an excellent cookbook for the cook who wants to prepare quality meals, but has limited time. Most ingredients, including seasonings, are easily procured or already on the shelf. Photography is beautiful and adds to the appeal of the food. I could happily have done without Martha's tedious running commentary on her fast track personal life, and that of her now divorced husband. But that can be ignored. It's the recipes that matter. This is a cook book that gets pulled down from the shelf."
3,Funkadelization,"This album brought back to me memories of the funk music that took the 80's by storm, although this genre never lasted that long. The sound did make an impression on the music scene and can be remembered as one of the genres that can be rejoiced with somthing different, it actually brought out the bass in the music.This is one album you should have if you are into the FUNK music. The otehr major group was Brass Contruction."
4,Another Great Series by Janette Oke,"I have read and love all of Janette Oke's books. A Searching Heart was another great story. I am anxiously waiting the next in the series. I see that there is a Book 4, but haven't been able to locate Book 3. What is it's title and where can I find it?"
3,"Great grip, not so great stitching....","These gloves feel and look great, they have great grip on the ball, but they either came with some stitching already broken, or some of the stitching came loose the first time I put the gloves on."
4,Michael Jackson~The King Of Pop's Darkest Hour,"I've read most books about Michael Jackson. Like many people, he absolutely fascinates me. This book was one of the best I've read about him. The author seems to be pleading for sympathy about the allegations against him for being a child molestor. She has written two books about him and I think if she continues, her next book will be even better. I think we all want details about this mysterious icon. It was a very good book."
2,DISAPPOINTED!,"Ms. Campbell wrote this book as if she has a personal axe to grind. Instead of stating the facts about this unfortunateconspiracy to discredit the intrigity of Michael Jackson.She came across as being unnessasarily defensive. Although Ican appreciate her desire to come to the defense of Mr. Jackson,She wrote this book out of emotion instead of taking a moreprofessional approach to make her point. If you desire to knowMichael Jackson better I highly recommend J. Randy Taraborelli'sMichael Jackson-The Magic and the Madness. It's a great book."
2,Biased P.O.V,"i totally agree with kimberly meredith! This book was clearly written from a one-sided p.o.v, with ms campbell portraying a one-sided argument, defending mj.J Randy Taraborelli's book is much better, giving readers a more 3-D insight into the life of mj."
3,Pretty good..,I know the basics in belly dancing but I still had a hard time keeping up. I tried it once but I'll just stick to running :)
5,TOO HIP,Great DVD in wonderful condition and well packaged for timely arrival! I just tried it on my player which is a very finicky machine! It played great even on that one! Thanks a bunch!
3,Very Cute,They are pretty cute and adds a little spice but many of the coupons are not practical. EX...Like lets make love on the beach..stuff along those lines. I mean how many of us live near to the beach. Over all its very cute great price worth a try.
2,THEY DO NOT STAY UP,"I am of average build 5'5""/ 130 lbs, and I got these b/c I wanted socks that would stay up, yet not suffocate my legs. All I can say is they simply DO NOT STAY UP. No matter how or where I wear them. They also bunch up under my foot constantly regardless of what type of shoe I wear. The softness is okay, but I avoid wearing them for the above reasons."
3,seamless knee high,"The socks are supposed to be extra small, they are too big and will not stay up. They do have excellent customer service."
3,"New design, not as thin","I bought these last year from SmartKnit and my son loved them. This year I purchased again but the design has changed and although it may have more lower leg support, we do not like them as much. He is a boy with no leg issues - we originally bought the socks for his sister who wears a brace - so our use of them is a-typical."
1,Order cancelled without warning.,"I was buying this CD for a friend and the order was cancelled, with no e-mail explaining why, just a letter from Amazon basically saying ""F-you. You are not important, move along""Needless to say I would avoid this store at all costs."
3,kapok,The great kapok tree was an okay book.I would give it 6 out of 10.It was a boring book.They repeat the same words.A 4-8 year old would like it.
3,"Great pictures, predictable plot","""The Great Kapok Tree"" is a nice predictable book for the age level it is designed for. It seems like every single animal in the rain forest comes to the man about to chop down the tree. They state so many reasons why the man should not cut down the tree. It is very informative about the dangers of depleting the rain forest, but I found the plot dry and not very interesting. The pictures are beautiful."
5,Great Book,I use this book as a teaching tool. I show students the importance of protecting our Earth.
1,The Opinion,"The Kapok TreeIt is a good book for 4-9 yrs old; because of the colorful pictures it is even better than Jan Brett's pictures. The story has great description for kids to enjoy. It also has a good moral for kids to learn about, and to do something about it. The moral is to save and protect the beautiful rainforest. Now most books don't have morals at all, and if they do they don't mean as much as this one .This one might cause many things to die."
1,tree,This book was very good. I thought that who ever wrote this book has a very creative mind. This book is very interesting I think that this is the best book that I ever read. I think that the person who wrote this book wrote it quickly because I read it slowly or maybe I read to quickly. This book was better than another book on rainforests. If I was able to recommend this book I would recommend this well written book to little children because they are our future.
1,Activism disguised as children's literature,"While beautifully illustrated and highly imaginative, The Great Kapok Tree is a heavy-handed attempt to create environmental activism in young, impressionable children. It is utterly one-sided, and places the welfare of animals above that of humans. At no time is the human story told. Instead, the ""right"" side of the issue (the politically correct side) is presented as the only possible way to think. It attempts to place on the shoulders of children the responsibility for ""saving"" the rain forest. Saving endangered species, environments, etc. is not the job of children."
2,The great kapok tree,I thought it was not a good book. I thought it was a 50% book and not a 100% book because it has a dumb reason to it. The reason is don't cut down the kapok tree. I mean it is just a tree. That is why I thought it was dumb.
3,The Great Kapok Tree,Report of The Great KapokThis book is a great book. It has a lot of meaning to it. I recommend this book to younger children in the ages of 5-8. But I think people of any other age can enjoy this wonderful book. This book is about two men going to a beautiful rain forest. One of the men was planning to cut down the Kapok tree but he fell asleep calmly. While he is sleeping animals speak in his ear and tell him why the tree is so important to them. Not just animals but a native little boy talked in his ear to. Later when the man wakes up he sees the animals and is about to swing his axe strongly at the tree. Well I can't tell you the rest of the story. But I can tell you that this book has a great moral to it. The moral is if you ruin one thing it can affect many other things.
3,pretty good overall,"the majority of this cd deserves four, maybe even five stars. however, i feel that certain tracks, such as riot society's ""understand me"" and trendroids own ""trendication"" kind of break the flow from the rest of the set.cd one is nice, mellow, smooth. ""understand me"", however it may be a decent song, is really 80's sounding. it doesnt quite...fit in with the feeling of transport.cd two is pretty good too, but the vocals on ""trendication"" are so annoying that i just want to skip it. the track would be fine...without the annoying hyper-pitched vocals. good thing dirty bass remedies this hatred for disk two immediately after trendroids track, releasing the rest of the disk.i'll give it 3.5 stars."
3,CD 1 is good and cd 2 freakin' sucks big time,"CD 1 is some good general house and proghouse, cd 2 is some of the worst dark and proghouse you will ever hear in your life. and i like all styles of house, cd 2 just sucks."
4,Pretty Banging,"I thought of giving up on progressive because I'd not found much that appealed to me of late, but so far, I've given this a good couple of listens, and I think this a smash banger set of cds worth the money if you're not some cheese candy kid. I definitely dig the belching distortion favored in this style over the high flying epicosity presented on, say, the first disc in this series. Words to describe it: Throbbing pulsing twisted shadowed ensorcelled tribal psychedelic frenzy. This particular style of progressive, with a fine set of headphones, provides the impetus required to launch the mind into an unusual mental space that I often find exceptionally rewarding. Its exceptionally thrilling to experience live in the proper mental state! To each their own brand of poison."
5,It's true: Trendroid rules!!!!,"If you love cheesy trance tunes, like those 2 fellows who rated this album only 1 star (they must be crazy!!!), please do what they say and don't buy this album....this album is only for people with good taste... what a great mix, I'm listening to both CDs again and again and again...beautiful.... thank you so much, Pankaj and Matt, for giving us mere mortals a taste of heaven..."
2,Very Housey Weak Compilation. . .,"Not that housey means bad, but this double-CD is definitely not worth the price of admission. If you're expecting a tremendous variety of textures and soundscapes like you find on Transport 4 (Max Graham-- 5 stars), Transport 2 (Dave Ralph- 4 stars), or even the darker Transport 5 (Quivver- John Graham-- 4.5 stars), look elsewhere. This is house beats, with very little of the trance synths and acid riffs that the series promises. The mixing is excellent, but the track selection does not meet the expectations of fans of the series. - BPXM LA"
4,"Not EXACTLY what I expected, but...","Left with the impression shorts had inner liner, does not. Still, VERY comfortable and good-looking!"
3,just a basket short more,"The looks are so simple and comun that i don't like it, doesn't look like the picture, i mean, i bought this one and a columbia short at same price, i'm a little dissampointed with this one when i compare both shorts quality details and design. But if you want to play basket or something like that go ahead because is good for this kind of activities"
3,I get the premise but...,It is an interesting idea but I just don't use it in my day to day life. I think the Christine Pariello books or the Dr Furman books are more practical and important.
1,awful and not reflective of her brilliance,"Rory Block is the best country blues guitarist and singer on the planet today. She was trained as a kid by the elder statesmen of the blues, people like Son House and Mississippi John Hurt, and she has done more than anyone to honor their legacy. My respect for her is boundless. That's why I am incredulous that she created this just-plain-awful album. The idea of producing an album of children's music is not inherently bad, but the execution on this album was terrible. Every song on this album made me cringe. I could not even listen to the album in its entirety. Even as a Rory Block completist, I chose to discard this album and try to forget that a woman whom I admire so much was ever capable of creating such garbage."
5,amazing,"We bought 2 of her CD's. One is for my car, one is for my husband's and in the house we have her on our iPod. We LOVE Tina Malia!!!!!!!!! I'm from Aspen, and love nature. All of her songs remind me of home."
5,Voice of an angel,"Tina Malia is one of THE best female vocalists of our time. I'm waiting for her 3 new albums being cut this year! She is a brilliant song writer, she plays the guitar, AND her voice sounds like an angel. This album is awesome."
2,Not for beginners,"I'm a beginner and i can already play a few blues piano things thanks to the homespun dvd of david bennett cohen. he is a very good teacher and explains techniques over and over again until you understand them!unfortunately dr. john is not really a teacher kind of guy. he's a very talented player, no doubt. but the fact that the producer Happy Traum had to sit next to him during the shooting to squeeze some techniques out of him already shows you right from the beginning that dr. john is not really there for teaching you anything. he's just doing what he can do best: playing and talking about fellow blues musicians!this dvd is definately not for beginners, more advanced players might get some interesting stuff out of it, i didn't..."
3,dr john lesson 1,"The dvd contained some great tunes and overhead shots of Dr. John's playing technique, but I found the transcriptions to be less than accurate. I transferred the audio track I was interested in learning to a file and used my SlowDowner to digest the tune. If you have a basic understanding of the blues and already know some licks, the dvd will be helpful. In any case, it still is great to listen to."
4,for multiple viewing,"I can't say The Doctor's 'teaching' style meshes with my learning style (I wouldn't even call it a teaching style), but if you watch often enough, the genius of what he's doing does get communicated."
2,Can't See What He's Playing,"Great pianist, uncontroversially, but the low resolution and quality of this video make it impossible to see what notes he's playing."
2,Not worth it,"I wanted to like this book.The main problem for me was that this book had no discernible plot. It was just Carkeet moving from one quirky player's problems to another quirky player's problems. I only read until page 50, and the book's plot had not start moving at that point. Not a good sign.I also didn't like the tone of the writing. Carkeet seems very taken by his quirky style and cleverness. It overwhelms the book, and is ultimately what keeps the plot bogged down in minutiae.Perhaps his existing fans will like this book, but I found it boring and unenjoyable."
2,Disappointing,"This was recommended as a great baseball book, and perhaps that sets the bar pretty low. Carkeet knows baseball, writing easily about nuance and detail of the game - to the point where a casual fan or non-fan will probably be at a loss. The problem is with the structure. The premise is that every member of a contending professional baseball team simultaneously falls into depression. Hijinks follow. Unfortunately, the narrative clicks so quickly from one character to the next, and there are nine protagonists, that it eventually becomes impossible to sort out one character from another. I found myself paging along, not remembering which character had which peculiarity, waiting for something to happen. Very little happened.Carkeet's prose is cute, and occasionally powerful. But the book is not particularly strong."
3,A sanitized life of Merton,"Thomas Merton holds endless fascination for millions of people, regardless of their faith. He was a strong-willed, independent thinker and spiritual leader. He was far from perfect, but he embraced his imperfections in order to attain something higher and better; he succeeded. This video hits some of the highlights of his life - but his affair with the hospital nurse - was conspicuous by its absence. Later videos have brought this topic to light. Still, for classroom or church use, this video is pretty darn good."
1,Lame attempt to cash in on a tragedy,"As someone who was personally involved in this incident and who knows as much or more about it than most, this book was insulting. Much of its so called ""factual information"" is incorrect. The wild speculations made are laughable. Here are two people who just happened to be in Glenwood Springs in July 1994 thinking that gives them some kind of ""direct connection"" to the tragedy. What a joke. Beyond the incredible and obvious attempt to make money from a disaster, the production of the book is as amateurish as the writing. It looks like it was produced on an old photocopier. Please, don't waste your time and money on this junk."
1,A Lesson on how NOT to write a book,"Its a shame that one star is the lowest rating we can give. This book doesnt even deserve that. I had to stop reading the book due to its MANY grammatical errors. This is an English teachers WORST NIGHTMARE. It might have been a good book with the help of an editor. I recommend ""Fire On The Mountain"", by John M. Maclean, INSTEAD of this book."
2,Could have been a good book,"The information in this book could have been excellent if it were not shadowed by the terrible grammar. I was unable to finish reading the book because of the errors. I find it a shame that this book is for sale and that some of the readers may assume the misuse of the English language is an acceptable way to write. I am an average person and I would have paid someone to proofread my book if I were to have it published, as I too make grammatical errors. With some more work this would be an excellent account of Storm King Mountain."
1,On Storm King Mountain: The Legacy...The Lesson,"I feel that this book was not well prepared. The book is based on facts, but the authors jump back and forth between using the persons involved by first and last name, and if you have no idea about the Storm King Mountain Fire, then you have to learn the persons name (first and last), and then sometimes it was their rank on the fire that was used. The book also had many typing erros, i.e. spelling, and grammar. Overall the book covered most of the fire facts, but I would recommend another book to fulfill your interests in the fire on Storm King Mountain"
4,On Stormking Mountain..The Legacy..The Lesson,"I have read this book. Two people giving their personal accounts of what happened while they were there on vacation. The strike on the cover lets you know the intent of such lightening storms. Their book gives an insight to the before and the after of the town of Glenwood Springs. And the mountain being a part of it, makes me want to go and visit the memorial site and climb the mountain. Then come back and soak in the Hot Springs. They give an account of what happened once the storm came in and what prevailed the next few days made me see life in a different view."
2,"Boring, first effort, heard second better","First movie for this guy, lots of hard work, but bored me. Glad I got a good price from amazon, would not have liked to pay heavy price I saw else where. Waiting to see his movie ""Mirage Man."""
3,Not one of Tamilee's Best,"I'm a fan of Tamilee, but this workout is pretty bad. Why does Natural Journeys insist on having their instructors workout in the blazing sun? For those instructors that can squint, they have no choice, and when they use Botox it's painful to see them try to squint. Poor Tamilee looks sun-burned to top it offBut on to the workout, I believe this is the cardio section of the Defy Gravity set, the workout itself is solid but the editing is not good and therefore the workout is not balanced. The ab section definitely has an editing error as only one side of your obliques are worked.I gave this a 3* for the self hypnosis section of the DVD and the CD, I've used the CD for 4 nights now and I'm already noticing a change, the booklet that comes with this is very nice and full of helpful information too."
3,I've seen better,"Not Tamilee's best video. And forget the ""hypnosis"" it's a bunch of flower scenes and some lady talking-didn't work for me at all."
2,Back cover description very misleading,"This is a cardio workout, with hardly any toning. It talks about strength training on the back- you wont increase any muscle with this workout. She pulls a rubber band out several times and pulls on it a little. Dont buy this if you want toning. It is nothing like the Firm toning/cardio workouts. As far as the cardio goes, its good and I would say moderate.There is a hypnosis cd with it which I did not listen to, so I cant say anything about it.Bottom line, dont buy this is you are looking for toning."
2,"Check out ""The Selfish Gene"" instead","This book was FAR too dense and technical. I bought it expecting to find something comparable to what Richard Dawkins would write. Instead, I found a book that was full of mathematical proofs and descriptions of computer programs. At whom was this aimed? There are very few people who could read something like this intelligently.One possible organization might have been: Some case studies of varied cases and then a description of the theory why they happened they way they did. And then appendices at the back that contained the proofs.I didn't make it past the first chapter, and I suspect that most others won't."
5,Who'd have thougt tit-for-tat makes sense?,"This book is a stunningly lucid combination of game theory, computer science, strategy and evolutionary psychology. I always eschew any kind of 'business' book, and encountered this in the course of a computer research project, but it has had great influence on my thinking in a variety of personal and professional fields.From first principles, and using ingenious empirical techniques, the author extrapolates from a simple so-called 'prisoner's dilemma' (would you betray a friend to save your neck?) right out to some extremely persuasive and general lessons on the conduct of potentially adversarial relationships.The conclusions he draws are both powerful in their application, and refreshingly humane in what they imply for optimal behaviour in stable societies.I'd rate this above even Kuhn's 'structure of scientific revolutions' as a piece of nominally scientific writing that has widespread relevance beyond the field for which it was intended."
1,Extended edition IS NOT EXTENDED!!!!,"""The updated edition includes an extensive new chapter on cooperation in cancer cells and among terrorist organizations.""WHAT?? I bought this, with the new preface and cover, and it DID NOT CONTAIN NEW MATERIAL IN THE BOOK. I wrote the published, and THEY DID NOT REPLY. Crappers."
3,"Great idea, repeated needlessly","The thesis of this book is powerful -- the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy works extremely well in a variety of situations. Unfortunately, this principle is repeated and rehashed numerous times, and made it a chore to finish reading. I think the book would have worked well at 1/3 the length."
4,Tit-for-tat !,"Great read. Principles can be applied to all areas of your life, especially in business. The book mathematically proves the concept that by cooperating with others both parties will be better off in the long run."
4,Case study of the Prisoner's Dilemma,"Axelrod discusses the Prisoner's Dilemma (classic case in game theory) in an iterated context. A wonderful read. Thorough, concise, and direct. I read it for fun, and enjoyed it. The book stays focused on an theoretical, academic perspective, but uses a few real-world examples.Be nice, quick forgiving, but instantly retaliatory, so says the book, but you will need to read the book to understand why."
5,Wonderfully insightful,"This book is a must-read not only for students (broadly defined) of the social sciences, but also for politicians and bureaucrats, especially those in charge of military and foreign affairs. Axelrod's book is a tour-de-force in multi-method approaches. Although the author is a trifle repetitive and occasionally laborious, I think the profound content of the book far outweighs the minor inadequacies of its form. At the risk of sounding like a logical positivist, I would venture to say that Axelrod's approach offers hope for a bottom-up construction of cooperation in an uncertain world without a central authority."
3,Excellent first chapter that is repeated throughout the book,"This book has a wonderful first chapter that Axelrod repeats throughout the book. Axelrod uses computer simulations to develop game theory and devise strategies that result in collaborative behaiviors. While Axelrod's findings can be applied to other fields, such as politics or interpersonal relationships, it should be noted that Axelrod is dealing with very precisely (and arbitrarily) defined initial conditions and constraints that are not at all gauranteed to exist outside the world of computer simulations. Generally speaking, the first chapter is excellent and offers a ray of hope that collaborative behaiviors can and will evolve on their own; on the other hand, the rest of the book is repetative and highly arbitrary."
5,One of the most amazing books I've ever read.,"If you're an intellectual and want to read a book that will change your perception of many facets of the world forever, this is the book for you. It's not a long read, but you will spend a lot of time thinking about all its implications as you read it. I found it applicable to everything from inviting people to parties, to business and personal relationships, to species competition, to wondering whether a theoretical race of super-powerful extraterrestrials would enslave us, to... Well, you just have to check it out!I'm reading the sequel (""The Complexity of Cooperation"") right now, which is also amazing. In it he quotes a letter written to him about EoC by a woman who claims that the principle developed in it helped her with her divorce proceedings! How can you miss a book with such broad applications."
4,"An analysis of trade, industry, land use and taxation","George writes convincingly about the need to remove the landlord from the equation when dealing with industrial ownership and taxation. He argues that the private ownership of land should be the sole source of government revenue, releasing trade from the shackles of corporate taxation, individuals from income and other indirect taxes and shifting the burden to the landed classes. It seems a justifiable premise to charge landlords for the land they occupy as inevitably land values rise only as a consequence of society as a whole and not due to anything the landlord contributes. Businesses pay ever increasing rents to a landlord who cares little whether that business is profitable or not. George proposes a single land tax but fails to answer the socialist question about industrial democracy and worker's particpation and control."
3,A good read!,"Although I found this book in the young adult section of my local library, I found it a very good book.I would have liked more from this book, more information on lesser characters and expanded historical information. The plot(s) was good but left you wanting a little more.The book follows the journey of a young English girl who goes to Kenya at the turn of the century to join her intended. The book follows the main character living in Kenya through World War ll. A large undertaking you must admit.I recently discovered Barbara Whitnell'l book and have enjoyed them very much. They offer the charm of Rosamunde Pilcher's wonderful books but with a bit more plot."
3,Not bad,"This is a okay romance book. The two sisters, Willow and Brittany, are very shallow, and I didn't even want them to get the guys. Anna was more likable, but she didn't have enough personality. This book skips around some. One moment they're in New England, the next they're in Mexico. It has a good ending that is only somewhat predictable. If you want a better teen romance novel, opt for Malibu Summer, by this author. It is much more intriguing and entertaining."
4,Civilized Africans find whites still living in caves.,"""Long after the destruction of Europe in the nuclear holocaust of 1984 a small expeditionary force is sent from Africa to seek the legendary island of Britain.""""Sc-Fi novel, set in Britain in the future, where a small expedition from Africa searches for traces of a legendary civilization that existed before the atomic blast. They find dense forests inhabited by mutant animals and stone age people, but also one intelligent survivor.""""Civilized Africans send a colonizing expedition to legendary Great Britain, where they find whites still living in caves."" -- (John Clute / Encyclopedia of Science Fiction)."
4,"Enough is enough "" A Review""","This book is very interesting reading. It provides perspective on life Pre WW II ,Post WW II ,the Auto Industry and insights about marriage ,committment and life in general. It is worth reading!"
2,bad taste,"It has everything we need a vitamin but my two year old will not take it. The taste is awful, I taste everything I give my daughter."
3,Taste is not that great as others claim,"I bought this because previous reviews said how great it tasted. My 3 year old smells everything before eating and detects everything I put in her drinks/food. She did not like it. I tasted it myself and although it is minor compared to other vitamins, you can still taste a chalky flavor. I managed to put it in her apple juice, she drinks it--slowly, but not as much as she would without it."
4,Good for milk drinkers,I give this to both my young children in their morning milk and it has always worked well. Does not constipate them like other vitamins I have tried.
2,Taste Made Him Gag,I have no idea how good or bad this stuff is because neither my child nor myself can get past the very strong flavor. It is a bit like drinking straight tart cherry juice.
3,ALMOST a thing,"This is a ""good news - bad news"" review. First, the ""good news"" - it is a well imagined - decently acted movie well into the third act - which - ""BAD NEWS"" falls apart faster than granma's diabetic cake. The ""connection"" to the JC 1982 version takes place in the CLOSING CREDITS. Despite early hopes - a dissapointment. C-"
4,This 'Thing' is good!,"There's not much good horror/thriller films today but I find this 'Thing' good for my collection. I haven't seen the original 'Thing' but this movie gives you an idea what's with the original.I say this is just good because there was too much talk at first. I hate chats. (lol) Anyway, this movie did the job for me, it scared my kids with those blood-sucking, human killing 'things'. A good movie to kill your spare time."
3,Stars for actors and effects,"The actors convey terror, paranoia and confusion well in this too-often-told story of a creature in the frozen polar region that absorbs humans, dogs, anything and then mimics their cells and gets larger and even more dangerous. The creature effects are especially gruesome and effective. We just don't need another remake of this."
1,Does not compare to THE THING 1982,"Not a very good prequel as some have stated. Other then the being, the end, and the Norwegian guys, it is so much like the original you may think you're watching a poorly done remake. You may give it a chance if you want to waste 3.99 as I did, but it was a waste of money for me. The Thing (1982) with Kurt Russell is awesome, this movie is eh. This movie does have up-to-date special FX, but it doesn't improve the movie at all. All I can say about the FX is ""Big whoop!"" (80s joke for us middle aged folks). I'll take Kurt Russell any day, these actors, who ever they are, do not do this movie justice. I'm not sure if any of them would do any movie justice. I wanted to like it, but I didn't. NEXT!!!"
1,Blu-ray? If you purchase a product it should be what you pay pay for!,Yes the problem I have with this is that the Blu-ray Disc would not play on my blu-ray player it tried to connect to the internet on my blu-ray player. Not all blu-ray owners own x-boxes or playstations. I shouldn't have to buy a x-box or playstation to watch a blu-ray movie when I have a blu-ray player already. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNTIL THEY COME OUT WITH A BLU-RAY DISC THAT WORKS ON BLU-RAY PLAYERS!
1,Another terrible sci-fi remake.,"After the terrible remake of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" you would think that Hollywood would learn how to make good science fiction again.This movie is really a horror movie not science fiction. Stick with the 1951 masterpiece and avoid the 2 disasters that came later. The Original 1951 ""The Thing From Another World"" cannot be beaten for tension, suspense, marvelous acting and an intelligent script. (And the beautiful Margaret Sheridan.)With eager anticipation we all wait for the movie ""Man Conquers Space""."
1,A little pile of poo,Is it a prequel? Is it sequel? Is it good story telling? The answer to all these questions is no! All this movie is is a forgettable pile of poo..... Spend your money on something else; don't reward Hollywood by giving them your hard earned money -- because they certainly did not work hard on this generic mess.
4,This is a great prequel to JC's The Thing,"This movie gets better every time I watch it and I believe in time it will reach a cult status. Not as much as JC's The Thing but after some time has passed it will be rediscovered like JC's version was. His took a while to find it's fans and so will this.I think they did a great job given the constraints. There are things I wish they had done different. I would have much rather it been all in Norwegian with subtitles or at the very least, no Americas as characters, However, any problems I have with the film are all subjective. It's a very good movie."
3,ok for a collecter.. way under the 1951 production,"Not as good as John C.'s the thing, nor the org. 1951 THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD.IF I didn't have the two prior versions, I wouldn't buy this one!!Effects not as good as those in the J.C. version, Acting NOT AS GOOD as the J.C.version NOR THE ORIGIONAL (1951).IF YOU BUY IT... GET THE OTHER VERSIONS ALSO..."
3,Fair,"It was good enough for rental, but I wouldn't have wanted topay $8 or more in a theater. It was pretty much the sameas the other Thing movies, nothing new here. It was interesting tosee a prequel, since I saw the Kurt Russel version."
4,Rental was pretty entertaining.,"This was a worthy prequel to ""The Thing,"" John Carpenter's '80s film treatment of ""Who Goes There,"" the great short story by John W. Campbell. The major plot points are pretty consistent with the '80s version. A main distinction is the method employed in each film to detect which humans have been body snatched into aliens. Each was clever in its own way.The special effects were quite good, nicely gross. If you're claustrophobic, this movie might not be the best choice. Otherwise, enjoy.As an aside, I highly recommend the original short story, ""Who Goes There."" A timeless page turner, that one."
2,Beware! DVD doesn't play on Blue-ray,"I really enjoyed this movie. However, there are plenty of reviews on the film itself. After ordering the dvd, I was very excited when I received word that it shipped. But, it wouldn't play in my Blue-ray player. I sent it back and got a replacement but it would not play either. My neighbor also tried on his Blue-ray to the same end. Previews play, Anti-piracy warning and then it freezes. I guess the Universal has finally come up with a way to insure that customers buy the blue-ray combo pack in order to watch in higher definition. A really crappy thing to do."
3,"""Thing""s have changed!","If you compare this one to the original,yes you will ask yourself many questions, this one was made with today's movie technology,special and computerized effects,the original one was made with hand made effects, The original ""Thing"" is in my movie collection but I dont think I will add this one to my collection, its just good for -one time- watch but I dont know how many times I watched the original one."
2,BUMMER,"Worst than Carpenters. It just doesn't make any sense. Its not scary, no character developement. I don't get the good reviews. Frankly, I think the original Howard Hawks production has far more tension than either of the recent THINGs.I'm just sayin"
3,An old classic remade well,"The orginal movie "" The Thing "" is a classic and I enjoy it at anytime. Wasn't sure what to expect with the remake, and Hollywood didn't disappoint with this updated remake. The special effects and the monster, well, lets say that you will enjoy this remake. I give it three stars. Enjoy"
1,Why?,"I dont usually write reviews but I had just had to shout about how bad this movie is,there is just no point to it,all it does is try & explain what happened at the norwegian camp that we saw in the 1982 version,why? as you watch the 1982 version unfold you realise that what is happening is what happened at the norwegian camp,that was the idea,that being said I sat back half expecting to be at least mildly entertained but no chance,all the tension & genuinely creepiness of john carpenters classic is just not here,there was nothing original & it was just plain boring,if the 1982 version never exsisted this movie would be on the sci fi channel. I saw a couple of people say that they always wanted to know how the axe had come to be where it was,are you kidding me? talking like it was a true story,jeez.I just cant believe how so many people rated this 5 stars,im actually quite envious of those people,wish I was that easily pleased,this movie is terrible,plain & simple,avoid at all costs."
2,This is it!?!?!,"The main problem with this film was that is is advertised as a prequel, the overall plot is so similar to the original that it just seems like a remake. And while that may be OK for the new generation of filmgoers who haven't seen the original, for all the majority of us who *have* seen the original, this is just sort of a waste of time. There is no clue as to where this ""thing"" comes from (other than space), what motivates it, or anything else that may differentiate from the original, even though that is the point of this film. The performances were good but the story predictable; sure, it ends directly how the beginning of the original starts, but the movie (as a whole) is sort of a waste). See the original 1982 John Carpenter version (The Thing (Collector's Edition)). It's good enough."
3,Nice try...,"This is a tough movie for me to rate. It's more of a 2.5 star for me having so much love for the '82 version.The Thing itself was too ""CGI'd"" for my tastes and didn't really change forms all that much. They really needed Rob Bottin and his practical special effects for this film, which was a star in itself in the Carpenter version. I was almost wishing for a lower budgeted film that may not have relied so much on CGI.The best parts of the film were actually the ""nods"" of what was to come in the Carpenter version: An axe left in the wall, the double-faced Thing, the dog-chase at the end, etc.Good acting and somewhat of a decent backstory."
2,Should have stopped with the first remake.,"Remakes are not always up to the original, but remakes of remakes are sure to fail. This version did that quite well. My wife and I give it a ""D"" for dumb. Save your money for popcorn & watch the original."
3,A half thing not a whole thing.,"They goofed again not taking advantage of the opprotunity at hand, they didnt show them finding the ship or finding the alien in the ice,they did not make the alien smart enough to hide like in the original movie. people saw it take over other people...duh not scarry or suspensfull,they tie the ending in very well with the beginning of the original,it did bother me that the chick was the only one that was smart,everyone else...big dummys! a pretty good movie its worth seeing."
1,"Disjointed, absurd, shallow, trite, tired, unoriginal, copied, ridiculous, silly, boring, and insulting to the intelligent.","This film is an example of film making by and for idiots. Why?1. The creature doesn't morph into efficient shapes. It uses faces because the director thinks it's scary, that's all.2. Why do scientific expeditions have flame throwers, grenades and pistols? Because the film needed them.3. Does anyone really believe an alien would bite a grenade or that a single grenade would destroy an alien star ship?4. The dialog and scenes are sloppy and confused. Where did everybody go? Do you care?5. Why must all SF films be made by and for idiots? Because Hollywood is run by them and they think we're idiots too.BOYCOT HOLLYWOOD SCHLOCKFESTS!"
3,Not the Original,"After watching this movie, I rate it as just good at best. The original is so much better than this one. The original was just plain scary and had better charactors. Watch the first one with Kurt Russell first then this one and you'll see what I mean."
1,Universal Studios Sucks,"I believe that no one has mentioned the six minutes of previews you have to wade through before getting to the menu. Also, if you have an Internet connection, you get nice pop up ads on the main menu for other Universal offerings. After paying 24 dollars for this thing, you would expect it to be ad free. Oh no, not Universal. They are going to pad this thing with as much advertising as possible.On to the movie. It was boring. There was no suspense or innovation. Nothing new at all. If you are going to make a prequel, or sequel, to a successful movie, it has to have something to make it stand on it's own. This movie does not have that. It is nothing more than a rehash of a better movie made 30 years ago with less money. I give the movie 2 stars and no stars for Universal and their bean counters."
3,thing # 2,As this was a prequel that came out 20 yrs after the original it was an interesting take. Not as dynamic as the Kurt Russell version though
4,Great Prequel!,"I like so many others loved the 1982 John Carpenter film. I was 12 when i saw it on HBO staying up late one night at my sisters. It scared the crap out of me and I've always loved the movie for that reason, it is true horror and fear. Upon watching this movie i was expecting to be let down even after a friend told me it was good. To my surprise it was very good indded. They did a great job connecting the films. They show the one guy that cut his own throat sitting in the chair all frozen is a great homage to the original. I kept wondering though how would this film stand up if you've never seen the 82 version. But becuase i did see the 82 version im giving it a must see rating!"
4,Better Than Carpenters!,"Except for the lack of differing creature forms (they had human faces), this movie was superior all the way, and they tied in nicely to Carpenter's version. I wasn't sure what happened to the female at the end, she didn't look like the suicide, and how Lars made it to the end for the tie-in I'm not sure, either. But their logic and ideas were better than the Russell gang, even that fingernails on the chalkboard blood/heat test.I love the 59 Hawks' version the best, though they are not really the same films due to the alterations from the story in the the first version. Still, the dialogue and repartee are so good it's funny and hilarious. The 80s film with Russell was too dour, and the shirt tearing thing was stupid, as if that meant anything.Nice to see the ship in this version, too, though you don't really see much. I wonder why they never found it or saw the videos in the 80s version?"
2,Warning - Amazon is mixing reviews,Beware that Amazon is combining reviews of the original 1982 John Carpenter version of The Thing and the 2011 prequel with the same title under both films. You'll find that most of the five-star reviews are for the former and the three-star ones are for the latter.
2,It's ok,"Put in the 1982 remake. Fast forward through some of the plot and any scene where they show any type of scientific or intellectual prowess. Also, you should pause the scenes with the thing then alternate between staring at it and watching tom and jerry cartoons. There you have it!"
5,awesome!!,"super awesome! great prequel, leads perfectly into the original, well done!i dont know why they need twenty words, i think i summed up how awesome this movie was in my first two half sentances"
3,A modernized version of something earlier?,"Funny how they made a movie which chronologically was supposed to come BEFORE John Carpenter's 1982 version more modern. They really didn't even try to make it seem like 1981. The movie starred an independent strong female lead and for some reason Norway has a black guy on their arctic expedition team. Why? It is so FORCED, and unlikely. The character development sucked, just like most of these ""remakes""/continuations/prequels. Just too fast, and you don't even care about the characters at all. It was, however, nice to see everything tie-in with the next, older, and far superior movie."
2,Mild Thing,"I made it to about half way through the movie. The acting seemed ""stiff"" because of obviously attempting to imitate the previous plot of the Carpenter/Kurt Russell classic. The visual effects of the present remake were made for graphic gore/horror, rather than being an expression of an already building suspense -- a suspense which captivated the audience of Carpenter's work. I found the new version predictable and disappointing."
3,Not For The John Carpenter Version Fans...,"I purchased this Blu-Ray without having seen the film in the theater. While the film itself is well acted, and the cinematography excellent, I cannot endorse it. Being a huge fan of the John Carpenter version (and '50's Howard Hawks), this film had at least three scenes that were identical to the John Carpenter version. Having the exact same title does not help either.If you do purchase this disc, I urge you to watch the John Carpenter version immediately following. You will see what I am referring to, and will enjoy the John Carpenter version even more."
2,poorly thought out,It kept along the story line of the 2 previous versions but christ it was set in Antartica and they were having day and night events like they were in Nebraska. Antartica for the most part is either daylight or night for months on end. When directors/producers do not even consider simple things like that it just makes a movie like this idiotic.
1,The Thing,"They say 2011's The Thing was intended to be a prequel to the John Carpenter classic of the same name, but whether you call it a reboot, a remake, a retread, or a prequel, most agree on one thing: it was unnecessary. Rule of thumb: if you're going to invoke the name of a beloved classic and slap it on your film, it better be a damn good film, because comparisons to the original are inevitable. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is the ostensible lead here, as a paleontologist who is brought to an Antarctic research station where a spacecraft has been discovered beneath the ice, complete with an extraterrestrial survivor. When the alien promptly escapes its icy prison and begins taking the form of the various researchers, jump scares and gore ensue. I found The Thing far inferior to the original, meeting only the bare minimum for a horror movie; you might could check it out if you're curious, but you're probably better off going with the original."
1,The Real Killer is....,"I do have to give this film credit, you don't know who the killer is until the end. Spoiler Alert: The killer is the movie itself. You see it kills two hours from your life that you will never get back."
3,thing,"the movie had good specail effect but rating it to the one that had kurt russel this one really stunk the story was lack lustered and not really that good,i would definately not recommend this to someone else ,i would recommend the earlier version alot better written and special affects wre alot better in that version"
2,"Terrible, I mean just terrible.","This alien gore fest was a big let down. I really expected a lot more then another zombie flick. Got two stars for the special FX. Bypass this one, you are warned."
1,Described as new. Was not new.,"When I ordered this item (DVD of ""The Thing"" 2011), it was described as ""New in shrink-wrap"". When it arrived, I opened it to find that it was not new. It was a Rental. I noticed a few light scratches. I thought that if it played okay, I would let the fact that is wasn't New, slide. It played fine. I got to the ""Bonus Features"" to find that I could not access them because it was a Rental.That pissed me off. How can someone describe an item as ""New"", when it is clearly ""Used""? I contacted the vendor via email through Amazon on Jun 17 2012, to resolve this issue, and have received no response.Amazon needs to screen these vendors a little more closely to make sure they are selling items as described. I will not use this vendor ever again and I am VERY UNSATISFIED.How does one resolve issues when the vendor does not reply to your request?If I could have rated this with zero stars, I would have. That's how pissed I am."
2,Unnecessary Movie,"I never thought that John Carpenter's movie needed a remake. I did NOT know, at the time, that this one is actually supposed to be a prequel. Even so, I didn't think that was needed either. And I was right. The Kurt Russell version contained characters that I cared about, and graphics that - for that time - stood out. This movie...none of that. I didn't care about the characters at all. Maybe because, except for the helicopter pilot, I didn't know who any of the actors were. I really only got interested at the end, where it goes into the tie-in with the John Carpenter movie. I'd just skip this movie. I wish I had."
1,This movie has no soul!,"Technically this movie is a prequel but is essentially a remake in that the same ideas are explored.Unfortunately by trying to stick close to the original (itself a remake of an older movie), it comes across as a cheap knock off! Throw in some laughably bad CGI and you have yourself a movie that is easily forgotten...this actually put me to sleep!"
2,Poorly written,"I hope the DVD comes with 10-15 extra minutes of footage that was left on the editting room floor because the final cut gave almost ZERO time to any of the characters other than Joel and Mary Elizabeth. There was no tension or intrigue trying to determine which character had been infected. The director displayed a lack of understanding, of how to effectively pace a horror/sc-fi flick. It's unfortunate because some of the death scenes were pretty darn chilling! I just didn't care about anyone in the movie and only knew 4 or 5 of their names. There is a reason why this film only lasted 3 weeks in major maket theaters. And why the release date was pushed back from April."
3,Wasn't as bad as you think!,We enjoyed watching it for our dinner and a movie. It was full of entertainment. We stayed awake! You'll like it too.
1,Awful,Not sure why I expected this to be any good but we turned it off after 30 minutes. Don't waste your time.
4,"No Carpenter, but a solid effort","This movie is a prequel to Carpenter's film, though it, smartly, stays in safe ""remake"" territory. There is enough different to keep you interested and enough the same to make you feel comfortable. The director does a fantastic job building the sense of paranoia, which is so essential for this to work. Solid FX and performances."
3,It was...ok I guess.,"The movie was ok, it could have been a lot better and I feel that the story was a bit rushed just to answer all the questions that myself and I'm sure others had asked when they first saw the original. The CGI I would have to say is the biggest flaw of the movie. With the original,everything was created by hand and was puppeteer'd by someone. In other words, it looked more real and felt real. As for this movie the CGI just goes way too far and even though it may look kinda scary or gruesome, your eyes can easily tell what is real and isn't in this movie. It was a nice attempt at a prequel but it was in my opinion a failed one. I will recommend that anyone who was a fan of the original to watch it, but only so they can decide for themselves if it's good or not."
2,Not very good...,Not very good. Kind of boring. Just a rehash of previous makes of The Thing. The Kurt Russell version is the best!
4,The thing,Isaw the original movie with KurtRussell and it fell in with how the space ship got their in the first place.
4,The Thing,I thought the movie was good. Although it left you asking more questions than answering them. Perhaps they will make a prequel to the prequel.
2,No where near as good as the original.,"Not too bad as far as remakes go, it had a few good moments and the effects weren't too terrible. In the end it was a bit too Sci-Fi for my tastes and of course the new male lead was no Kurt Russell."
1,Perfect reason not to remake a classics movie,"Wow, this movie is awful. Not at all like the classic film from the 70's. It relies completely on CGI and gore. I was bored, to say the very least. Watch the real, John Carpenter version. It's scary as all get out without relying on CGI only. Save your moolah!"
5,excellent remake/prequel,"Great job getting the feel/environment right for this movie & i think it stacks up well against the original Thing. Very creepy, gory, interesting. Very happy with this movie & look forward to seeing it again!"
3,It's actually doesn't suck,"I just rented this. And I was shocked. It's not the horrible film I was expecting. It was actually pretty entertaining. It would have been nice to see what the thing actually looks like in it's natural form, but I guess that is for the imagination I suppose. But what happens to the woman? Did she make it to the Russian camp? If she did make it did she have any Alien dna on her clothing? It has all the makings of a horrible sequel. Maybe they will call it ""Things"". Bad Joke I know. But I will give credit to the director, whom obviously knows the 1982 version front and back. The placement of the deceased things are exactly where Kurt Russels character finds them later that day. I will end my review here. Don't want to give too much away. Totally worth a rental for sure. I might actually purchase this."
3,Not bad!,"Sure this was not as good as 1982 ""Thing"", but it was still good.I remember seeing the 82' ""Thing"" in theaters and watching people walk-out as they found it too over-the-top. And in all fairness it was not a Great film, but the effects were Fantastic and it built tension.This one has good effects for CGI and still manages some nice tension.Overall I enjoyed it."
2,Don't bother.,"Well there goes a little over an hour I'll never see again. While the special ""monster effects"" were grotesque and well done, the characters lacked any empathy at all. I could not have cared less about any of them. The ending didn't make sense and was inconclusive. The female lead was flat and had no spark at all. The characters were 2 dimensional and not at all developed. What a waste of time! The only good part was the little song the Norwegians were singing after they found the ""thing"" in the rec room."
5,Absolutely fantastic,If you are a thing fan this is your prequel. Get it! And I won't spoil the ending.Its more spookier than the one with Kurt Russel.
5,Awesome movie and plot.,"This movie is very well made and has awesome effects. I think the best part is that the movie actually turns out to be a prequel to the 1980s version starring Kurt Russel. Just awesome, both movies!"
3,a great blu ray of a decent movie.,"This film is like a tribute to the john carpenter version of the thing. It is a direct prequel to that movie. It's not a terrible movie at all and the main fault I can find with this one is the use of computer effects instead of building monster effects like the first one. I don't see why this is hated by some , it's not a remake in spite of the name. I like the original 1950 version as well and hope for a blu ray release on that one too. The acting is decent and the story is what you would expect from a prequel of the 1982 version. It is a decent horror sci fi movie and if you have seen the other things you should enjoy this movie. Just don't expect something different. although you do see the spaceships insides in this movie and you didn't in the past versions. It actually has a part in the plot even."
4,edwinrsullivant lit review,"This book is charming and imaginative, it is worth the cover price based upon the beautiful illustrations which perfectly compliment a very wonderful story for children that will enrich their reading experience. I will place it on the top shelf at home, and can heartily recommend this read for all elementary aged school children. I think teachers will like it too."
3,A Ballet Without the Dance,The language in this book is beautiful and lyrical supplying all the wonder that you hear when you listen to the music of Swan Lake. But while we may recieve endless descriptions of yams and yam kitchens we do not recieve any details of what is actually occuring in the story. I felt it was very much like listening to Swan Lake as opposed to watching it. Doing one without the other is only half the experience.
1,Another voyage into the world of Myth,Unmasking Satan is a simple task of sheddng the skin of mythology and getting on with your life. Try the real world and not one of cloak and daggers with non-existing ghosts and gobblins. Books like this join the long list of money making schemes by Pastors/Preachers and televangelits to make a fast buck off of you. Keep your hard earned dollars in your bank account and do not hand it over to these people.
4,such a cult following,if you are thinking about buying this a good drama movie then your wrong its a cult movie only those who have seen it understand
4,Amazing,"The extraordinarily awkward sex scenes surprised me a little, as they were seemingly endless. Skipping through them works out well. Other than that, this movie was exactly what I expected - deliciously bad and delightfully quotable."
1,Worst film ever made but funny,"Terrible movie, but funny cause it's so bad. If you like watching bad movies, this might be for you. If not, stay away from it. Even people that like bad movies might want to think twice before purchasing. Look up clips on another site before purchasing. If there were awards for worst ____, this would win them all. Worst director, worst actor, worst screen writer."
4,Wow! Are you serious?,"Okay, this movie is GOD-awful but it is funny as hell. The story line is mediocre, but the horrible acting makes it worth watching.what makes it funny because it's suppose to be a drama. I must say, if u are serious about movies and lack a sense of humor this is not for you. If u want a good laugh, check it out. It's even better with a group of friends because the lines of the movie will be an inside joke for weeks."
1,You're tearing me apart!!!,This movie sucks. There's just no other way to say it. It really really sucks.Who goes out and throws a football around while wearing a tuxedo?
4,Great For A Bad Movie Night,"The movie is great! It's just as bad as I expected to be. But there were parts of the movie that were slightly competent (kind of like a soap opera level performance) that ended up being boring kinda. But that was probably only about a fourth of the movie. The songs and performance were hilarious. Although I diddn't really need to see the main character's butt. He is also the director so maybe he just wants people to see it, I don't know."
1,The worst,"The worst script...The worst cast...The worst acting...The worst direction...The worst 'star' (although 'Black Hole' seems more appropriate......quite simply, currently the worst film ever made.Ugly people doing ugly, incoherent, ridiculous, things.There's really no reason to rehash the untenable 'plot' of this film, others have done it well enough.At least one of them dies at the end, unfortunately it did not have an ending like ""Penn and Teller get killed"", where everyone dies at the end of the film in a comedic manner. Some indication that this was supposed to have been a comedy, and the audience was just not in on the joke would at least have made this film tolerable.No, on second thought, it's just unwatchable.It's movies like this that make me wonder why Amazon won't allow a 'zero star' rating."
1,TERRIBLE,"This movie is badly written, has terrible pacing, and horrible acting. It's also incredibly repetitive, with several scenes which resemble one another."
1,tried to keep me awake. didn't.,"LMAO!!!!First there was ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"". Then there was ""Manos:the hands of whatever"". Now we have this crap. So bad I laffed thru it. Watch it - yes. Buy it - no!!!"
1,Bad. Not good-bad. Just bad.,"The ONLY good thing about The Room is the hysterically funny Rifftrax by Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett, available from rifftrax.com.Otherwise, imagine this: You can't sleep. It's 3:30 AM. You turn on the TV and the guide tells you you've got 287 channels playing infomercials, two channels playing The Nanny, and one channel playing The Room, uncut and commercial-free. What do you do? You watch the infomercial for the colon cleaner because it has better production values, better acting, better writing, and a better plot than The Room.The Room is not camp-funny or cult-bad or so-bad-I-can't-stop-watching. It's just bad. Bad acting (from every actor). Bad characterizations (from every character). Bad casting (all of 'em, but the mugger actor should be playing a preschool teacher). Bad-but-not-funny-bad dialog. And pointless PG-rated love scenes every few minutes.It's not even so-bad-I-am-getting-angry bad. It's just pointlessly boringly bad."
1,Worst movie ever made.,"It is SO awful, I scream-laughed through the entire movie. I now give it to friends as birthday and christmas presents, because it's so fun to watch with other people and share in the hilarity - like watching a cartoon train-wreck. It just amazes. It is a cult phenomenon."
1,"To avoid physical pain, see it with Rifftrax.com","A quick word about this movie: this film is NOT an intentional comedy. Whoever said that LIED in hopes scraping up some dignity for this melodramatic calamity.I don't know which is funnier, the fact that the lead actor/director looks like the Hallmark Movies: Frankenstein monster, or the random peripheral characters who appear with no introduction or purpose, or the strange continuity that have the lead characters doing things like, going to the church in tuxedoes while discussing the big wedding day and then playing football in the next scene and asking about the wedding date.I watched this movie straight through and laughed so hard my stomach ached. But that is nothing as to how funny it is with Rifftrax added commentary. Rifftracks is easy to use and I highly recommend watching it with your DVD."
3,How should one rate this?,"Obviously, this movie is bad. So bad, that it's brilliantly entertaining.This film tells the tragic tale of our hero, Johnny, a man whose ""future wife"", Lisa, is secretly cheating on him with his best friend, Mark. Although that's the main story, there are several pointless and unresolved sub-plots, which make ""The Room"" the cinematic ""masterpiece"" it is.This movie is best seen with others, rather than alone, although I admit I found it amusing while watching it on my own."
4,So bad - it makes a wonderful learning tool.,"Someone once said that maybe your purpose in life is just to be a bad example for others. That's how I feel about ""The Room.""This film is so bad on so many levels, that it almost becomes a step-by-step guide for wrong choices, whether it's dialogue, acting, camera set-up, direction, structure, character development, etc.Is it so bad it's good? In a lot of ways, yes. It IS so bad it's hilarious. I was crying my eyes out from laughing so hard...but, please, don't go in expecting brilliance on every level - you won't find it here. But what you will find is a fascinating film done terribly.Honestly, if I was teaching a film study class where we watched films to point out flaws on film-making - I would only have to show this film."
4,Worst movie ever,"This is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. None of the scenes make any sense, the dialog is the worst I've ever heard, and Tommy Wiseau might actually be an alien or a robot. But it's also a hilarious movie to watch. I quote this movie pretty much daily. Definitely worth watching to see how bad a movie can be and to see how many times football catches from three feet apart and ""Oh hi..."" come up. You'll be riveted when Lisa asks Tommy if he got his promotion and he says no and then she asks ""You didn't get it did you?"" Groundbreaking."
1,The Room,"This DVD was purchase as a gift for my son. Unfortunately I ended up watching it. I will say however that unless it was totally on purpose, this had to be the worst movie that I have seen in many many years. If it was done as a sort of tongue in cheek ok. Sorry, but I have missed out. Anyway I really hope that they don't make a sequel."
3,It serves the purpose,it was for a gift and the receiver was OK with the show then I am fine with it. :)
5,Can you NOT love Tommy Wiseau??,"This film is so, SO bad that it's great. Love the performance of Tommy and it has a lot of catch frases which you'll be repeating for the rest of your life (g.e. ""You are Tearing me Appart Lisa!!"")"
5,Such attention to detail...,"I now mark my life into two parts - life before and after The Room. After seeing The Room, things seem differently. Colors now have taste. Taste no longer exists. My ears are willed with Tommy Wiseau's ""Oh, hi there!""See The Room, and be transformed into another consciousness than never knew how people behave, or talk, or think. A fever dream in which situations arise and disappear without leaving a trace. Where leading men can look like shambling corpses a few weeks old. Where the meaning of roses and chocolates have become perverse symbols of love. Where perversion is normal, where normal is perversion.This is... The Room."
1,Destroys your will to live.,"I don't know how anyone can finish it. I could barely get past the first scene. When I first saw the main dude, who looks like a cross between Yanni and Van Damme, I thought, ""Aw, the blonde girl is being nice to the creepy serial-killer. Wait, he's her fiancee? Well, at least I don't have to see them having sex or his naked body--OH DEAR GOD NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"""
5,A MASTERPIECE! You must see it!,"Tommy Wiseau's ""The Room"" will be compared to such classics as ""The Godfather"", ""Casablanca"", and ""Requiem For A Dream"". Mr. Wiseau's film tears apart the conventions of cinema as we know it. This film will be analyzed for years to come to it's abrupt and shocking ending. I highly recommend this film, as a must watch for anyone who wants to understand the art of film."
3,Watch it with a group of friends and laugh your head off,"This movie is so horrifically stupid and poorly written that you HAVE to see it! Get a bunch of friends together so you can all poke fun at the bad production design, incredibly phony backdrops, inexplicable roof scenes, all three lovemaking scenes set to dorky music, the goofy dialogue, bottom-of-the-barrel acting, and more. This movie has it all!"
2,Soft Core Porm Mixed With Cult Film,"This film has numerous soft core scenes with nudity and fornication. Be careful if you are thinking that this is your typical cult film (e.g., Manos -- Hands of Fate, Reefer Madness, Birdemic), as it is obvious that the sex scenes were added to increase its ""marketability"". It is still an awful film that is funny to watch, but it has an R rating that should be respected. Unless, of course, you want to combine the cult film experience with a ""birds and the bees"" indoctrination!"
1,Absolutely terrible,"This disaster is the responsibility of Wiseau who acted in, directed, and produced this terrible film.The script is terrible.Most of the acting is terrible. Wiseau looks and laughs like someone stoned. Danielle cannot act and is not ""beautiful"" so her allure is inexplicable.The plot is terrible and predictable.Wiseau shows off his zero fat body in two sex scenes.Juliette Danielle shows off her breasts.Greg Sestero shows that he is handsome with a beard and a pretty boy without it.Other characters come and go without adding anything to the story, especially the orphan boy played by Philip Haldiman.To illustrate the plot problems, the four buddies are dressed in tuxedos and decide to play football. Why are they dressed in tuxedos? Is this the day of the much talked about wedding? No. It makes no sense at all.Do not waste your time or money on this disaster."
4,"Like reality, some hits, some misseas","It is nice to have so many of Mr. Simon's plays in one collection (four or five collections ultimately). I bought this one for the musical ""Little Me"". The book has a rather depressing, self-depreciating introduction by Mr. Simon and then gets to the plays (I won't list them here). They are easy-reading, contain many stage directions that help the reader picture what is happening on stage, and intelligently written. My one gripe is that there are no credits at the beginning of each one - cast lists, opening date and what theater, how many performances, etc.This is a good one for studying excellent play structure, character development and motivation, and how to build upon jokes and lines spoken as far back as a previous scene. Well worth the money."
5,Collected Plays of Neil Simon Vol I,Most Neil Simon plays are wonderful and I enjoyed reading them. Some of them were no so terriffic.
2,"If you can survive the first 15 minutes, you may enjoy it....?","There are a few hurdles you'll need to overcome in order to watch this one. First, in the opening scene around a campfire you will be introduced to one of the most annoying actors/characters ever in a B-movie - the guy is so tediously happy and grinning that you alomst wonder if he's stoned, as he's got that perpetual ""I'm sooo high, dude"" attitude (when, in fact, he's not high) that you'll just be begging for the killer to come around the campfire with an axe and relieve us all of the character. Next, you'll be treated to the longest opening credits that you will ever encounter... But, get past those two things, and you may find you enjoyed this one, if only compared to other B-Horror movies. Unfortunately, I was so put off by the aforementioned scenes that I started the movie with a negative outlook. I look forward to other reviews to see if it's just me, or if I was right on :)"
4,Easy to read english backed up with solid maths,"C S Bull was a reader in Physics at the Uni. Birmingham.The book is written in straight forward English. It is written in a way that conveys information in a natural manner - I found it an easy read. The writer knows his work, explaining the historical background behind the derivation of physical constants etc (example Plank's constant).There is plenty of maths to entertain you with. Its written at an elementary level - the stuff that a basic engineering background can cope with. There is a good sprinkling of graphs and circuits, to back up the maths, as well.This book is an example of good technical writing , written with clarity and grace."
5,The Secret of Success in Real Estate,I read this book about 20 years ago when a friend lent me a copy. To this day I have never found any other creative real estate book that was so informative and motivating. I credit my own financial success to Mentors who I have learned from personally and by books like this.Mr. Zeckendorf truly believed in Arbitrage Real Estate; the ability to control and remarket real estate quickly for immediate profit. He used the Lease Purchase/Lease Option technique for control without heavy investment and liability. He was also able to generate multiple streams of income and lived the good life but was not ostentatious. He was a doer not a whinner. He didn't wait for things to happen he made them happen.The only shame is that this book is not more widely available for seasoned and neophyte investors. $300.00 is a great deal for one book.Would I pay for it ?You bet :-)Claude Diamond
5,Hard to put down,"I really found this book hard to put down. Good story line, great characters, good golf content, and enough action to keep you riveted. An easy and great read."
3,Interesting but not compelling,"This is the kind of book you can slowly work your way through. It is not a page turner for sure, but weaves a tale that keeps one interested to seeing through to the end. The author tries to make a look at life, relationships, and character centered around golf. It may be trivial for some and eye opening for others. I'm not disappointed, but not awe struck either."
2,Formulaic and symplistic,"I hate to disagree with the other reviews, but I purchased this book to read on my vacation and was very disappointed. I agree with others that it is a very breezy novel and was able to plow through it in two days. Unfortunately, this book fell well below my expectations. The characters were rather one-dimentional, the plot was predictable, and the conclusion flat. I'd recommend this as good adolescent fiction, but simplistic and formulaic for adult readers."
3,Not about golf at all!!,"Yes, these kids play golf, but it has nothing to do with the spiritual side of golf at all. Bagger Vance this ain't. It was an ok read but it was depressing, and the deal with the ""mystery"" girl had no business in the story."
2,Not that great....,"Belva Plain has created a story that is historically accurate and completely believable as you are reading it....but there is something that she just fails to capture in writing this book. As you are reading it you are not drawn to the characters and they really aren't deep characters at all but rather shallow and superficial. The plot, while interesting, is not a page turner and it is mostly concentrated on the love aspect. Also the ending in my opinion was rather disappointing."
5,"I liked all her books, but did not read this one yet",Did not read - saving it for long winter night. That was the only book of hers that I did not have - was surprised to get it so fast.
3,Too many typos,"I enjoyed the book as I am a Belva Plain fan. However, there were so many typos (Kindle version) I had to keep backtracking to make sure that I got the full meaning of some sentences. There were tons of typos."
5,unprejudiced,"every time you read a war book, american(or western) troops are supermen , one soldier blows away a tousand russians with one hand grenade! it makes you sick , not that i hate americans, on the contrary, but that's just not real modern war is a massacre and this book shows that very well, it's realistic , people die a lot on both sides there is blood , steel and real war . i hate ralph peters , but hats off for being objective and giving the other guys a chance ."
2,A mechanical war story,"There is no longer a Soviet empire which makes the book anachronistic. It lacks credibility because it deals only with mechanic war manuevers. It supplies no political background. The invasion just comes out of the blue - no motivation, no explanation, no ""big picture"". Just a mechanical war story. Maybe living a potential war reality in Israel is part of what makes me cynical about this fictional book."
3,If you liked the film....,"...read the book. I certainly enjoyed the film, but the book was much better. Really, I'm not 'that guy' who always says that. I'm not a BIG reader...but I couldn't put the book down (its quite long too!). The book is much much funnier (the film couldn't capture alot of Evans' wit) because its obviously more subjective.The soundtrack is fabulously fun. Legrand's ""Di-Gue..."" has been pumping in my head for 5 months now!"
4,Not for the home designer,"The ""Historic"" part of the title must be taken seriously. All of the houses are very big and open to the public. This is not a book for anyone wanting to duplicate Arts & Crafts style. There are much better books for that purpose. The book is fine, but a minor glitch occurs on pages 134-135. The same painting shown in two photographs shows that one of the photos is mirror-image."
1,Button sticks... a big problem!,"I purchased this product to be primarily used as a tool for advancing my classroom PowerPoint slideshows. At first, I loved my new freedom to move about the room while giving lectures. After a couple of weeks of gentle use, the advance button started to stick which causes the presentation to advance out of control to the end. I called customer service, and they kindly sent me a replacement. During the first day's use of my new pointer, the button stuck and a slideshow advanced out of control again.I will be looking for a different model. I suggest you do the same."
2,Cheap piece of junk,"This is a flimsy piece of junk. The laser pointer stopped working for me after a day or two. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the changer did work, but only for about 6 months and then that broke too. Now I have to get something else but definitely will not buy this again."
2,Pros & Cons,"Pros: Nice size, fits nicely in my hand, easy to use.Cons: Sure requires frequent battery changes! After a couple of two-hour lectures, the special-order odd-size battery must be replaced. Also, the laser beam is weak and really exhausts the battery life, so I stopped using it. To be fair, this is my first such product to use and perhaps all of them soak up lots of battery power."
4,"Great pizza crust, but check for moldy packages","A real find for celiac pizza lovers! Two times that I have received an order, though, some of the packages were already moldy even though the expiration date was some time in the future. Amazon took care of this problem very quickly. Just check your packages carefully when they arrive and then enjoy some pizza!"

4,Cool product,"Really like the talking caller ID, but you cannot turn off the talking part, you can turn off the ringer at night, but it will still announce who is calling. The talking part is cool, if I am not near the phone I can just listen to who is calling and whether or not I want to run and answer the call or not. You can also add numbers and names to phone book and the talking caller ID will then use the name you have in phone book. So all in all I am very pleased with the phone, we just unplug it at night so it will not wake us."
1,Terrible quality,"Purchased this itellitouch SBC-166 speaking caller id phone. Phone package was in good shape but phone had many out of the box problems. Phone jack port was shoved up into phone, had to use tweezers to pull port back into position to use. Speaking caller id did not work at all. Very bad quality, many problems, did not work, sent back same day for refund, would never buy again!"
2,Dissatisfaction,"I am totally dissatisfied with my purchase. I ordered a big-button talking telephone. It does not have the big-buttons as requested, and yes it does talk, but the language can not be understood at rimes."
1,Price does not = Quality,"I am tired of purchasing cheaply made items so I decided to buy this more expensive phone (relatively speaking). It lasted me one year. Not only that, the handset sits in a cradle that is so weak that a simple knock or tug on the cord, slides it off. I wish somebody would start to make a quality product. Here's a telephone that after one year, has become landfill. The last phone I purchased, 30 years ago, still works."
2,Corded phone,Didn't last 6 months before having problems: lost the ability to announce incoming call; loudness volume
2,bad quality CD,"The first 4 songs are a Diz small band, and are recorded in the mid 70's. This is not bad, although I've heard a better version of ""Swing Low"". The last five songs are the problem. They're a Diz big band, recorded ""throughout the late 50's"". The sound quality on them is pretty poor. The worst is the song ""Two Bass Hit"". A few seconds into the song it sounds like the tape stretched (I know, it's a CD), so now you're listening to the same thing at a slower speed/wrong pitch. It continues at the slower speed for the rest of the song. What's silly is that this is only 3 minutes out of a 63 minute CD. They should have just left the song off the CD.The only reason for considering this CD is that you want some Dizzy at a bargain price. If that's what you want, you can do better. Try ""Things To Come"" or ""Night In Tunisia"" - on the same label, and for sale at the same price here at Amazon."
5,Really is a nice bag,I got my bag about a week or two ago. I really enjoy it very easy to transport. It holds alot but not to big. Over all this is a great buy
5,Great buy,"I scored this for < $30.00Great bag for the buy.Targus quality, and it's actually quiet roomy for me.Even with a Dell D620 or Dell D600, there's still room for my jacket, external drives, PDA, cables for both, headphones, mini telephone directory, lunch, and whatever else i choose to put in there.Also when placed straps up, on the backseat of car, it so far has not garnered any unwanted attention."
3,Well made but not as large as expected,"This bag is well-made with strong zippers. The only downside is that once you put in the laptop you cannot put too many other things in there - maybe a text book or so. I was hoping for more pockets for accessories. Overall, it's a good basic bag but don't expect too many bells and whistles."
3,"cery good, very small","This tiny book is a good way to remind yourself of the task at hands. It was a bit smaller than i expected though. Still, about everything you need to know is here and in the order you want to do it."
1,Contains less than competitors,"The most popular competing products have more 500mg of krill oil per softgel, while Twinlab only has 300mg. For example, Jarrow has 75mg EPA and 45 mg DPA, while the Twinlab only has 45 mg EPA and 27 mg DPA."
1,Very Misleading As To Amount of Krill Oil,"The previous reviewer is correct. Twin Labs is a blend of Krill and other stuff so you get less than the other brands. Be sure you get NKO Krill, the quality of other sources is quite variable at this point. The name brands, such as Jarrow, Now, all use NKO Krill, which is a patented process. The only concern is how old it is. Check the expiration date."
3,"Well done, but troubling.","I think ""The Living Edens"" videos are wonderful. I enjoy watching them repeatedly when I initially receive them, but in the case of ""Etosha,"" watching it one time was enough. The plight of the cheetah family in this video is almost unbearable to view. The producers did a very effective job conveying the tragic circumstances the creatures in this environment must endure to exist. I watch videos for entertainment and I found nothing ""enjoyable"" about this one. Although the ""Etosha"" video seemed much harsher than the others in the series I have seen, if you can tolerate the realism and don't plan on watching with children, I believe it is worth viewing...once."
5,Battle for Belleau Wood,"Pamphlet includes recollections of very interesting details of one marine's experiences during the Battle for Belleau Wood. Rather than the normal historical overview, this document is written from an individual's perspective, including rare descriptions of challenges with equipment to the gut-wrenching details of personal experiences in hand-to-hand combat. An interesting read."
2,Lots of material but could be presented better,"I used this book in an electronic circuits class taught by the author. I great deal of information is covered, but not very well. There are not enough examples and the practical applications are not emphasized (could've been more SPICE explanations). The book is very theory heavy so it will go over well with profs, but there are a lot better books out there for those outside academia or those just wanting a second source with their own textbook. (Art of Electronics has the right presentation style but is getting way out of date)."
2,Another MelBay Loser,"I fell alseep twice as joe almost did wathcing this Joe you are the master and I love you and the music man but come on this was the most uninspiring video I ever laid eyes on! No booklet no tabs nothing but joe up front playing 4 tunes then talking about them, once again melbay gets the job Not Done!!"
3,Useful Only If...,"Alert: The player needs to be already proficient in the harmonies of the tunes, Stella by Starlight & Autumn Leaves, covered in the teaching session. But then, even though the player is already very familiar with the harmonies of these tunes, Mel Bay should have provided transcription of some kind because there are indeed a lot of musical ideas Joe covers on the tunes. This DVD is recommended only if the player is:(1) already proficient in performing the aforementioned tunes,(2) looking for interesting chordal ideas to play these tunes, and then apply them to some other tunes.This means that the player has to be on advanced level to make use of this DVD. A less advanced and generally more useful DVD of the same genre is otherwiseBeyond Basics - Jazz Rhythm ChopsThe last thing I need to point out is that the sound quality of this DVD is quite poor."
2,Joe Diorio: Solo Guitar Concepts,"Jo Diorio is a phenomenal player but the video did not do justice to his audience. The demonstrations for both ""Stella by Starlight"" and ""Autumn Leaves"" were only somewhat inspirational and I found that it was all too difficult for me, a reasonably accomplished jazz guitarist; i.e. I know the tunes, to see around his fingers or determine what frets and strings positions he was playing at. The duration of each song (as noted in other reviews) was lengthy and at times even the tunes became somewhat boring to watch.While his limited recommendations were worthwhile he talked very little about his chord fragments, harmonies, arranging solo pieces, fills, comping, bass lines, intervals and chord inversions that he used, as promised in the write up. His banter demonstrated a lack of preparedness.2 stars for entertainment value."
4,Great price for abriged version.,"I am a culinary student and used this book for reference material for school. It was exactly what I was looking for, and the price was great."
2,"If it looks too good to be true, it probably is.","I'm a Chef, and have borrowed copies of Escoffier's Le Guide Culinaire from friends whenever I need it. On a lark, I ran a search on Escoffier here at Amazon.com. I was stunned to find this book for the low cost of $12 or so, knowing that every other copy I had seen cost $60 or $70. So I ordered it and paged through it. Well, it only prints 2300 or so of over 5000 recipes in Escoffier's treatise. Admittedly, probably more than the home cook actually *needs*, but nowhere does the book say that it has been abridged.But, like many Amazon.com customers, I found myself in the position of thinking ""but it'll cost me half the price of the book to send it back."" So I wound up giving it to a friend who likes to cook, but doesn't need the ""real thing.""Suffice it to say that if you want the real Esoffier, you're still going to have to drop the $60+ for the Van Nostrand Reinhold edition. Sorry, culinary students, you didn't luck up on a deal.ToqueBlanc"
4,Tired of chefs ommitting that one little step?,"This book, published in the 1890s, is an excellent resource for those who aspire to cook great french food. Too often cookbook authors insult readers by leaving out key steps for fear that they may be 'too complicated' or call for veal stock when chefs use demi-glace. This book is complicated, poorly organized and difficult, but it WILL tell you the proper way to make french sauces (an incredible section, and well worth the price of the book in itself) and how best to lard a joint of beef. Treat yourself and buy this book to learn the proper way to prepare traditional french cuisine."
2,It's probably an abridged version,"I do not how big or how many recipes the original Escoffier book has, but this one is most probably not the all-in version. As i read through the book, i somehow found myself loosing my way from one category to the other, not to mention that there are lists and indexes that are lacking basic data - which certainly Escoffier hadn't left out when he first wrote the book.However, as a first contact with this great Chef, it's a good start buying this if you do not want to spend more for the full version. Just have in mind that - expect for the hard cover - the rest of the paper used for this version is of really low quality and very easy to be torn apart."
3,This is the Abridged Version,Please note that this is an abridged version of Escoffier's famous Le Guide Culinaire. If you want the translated to English COMPLETE version buy the Cracknell- and Kaufmann-edited version instead (click link).Escoffier
2,"great book, poor paper","I was given this book as gift ten years ago. I enjoy the content and style of the recipes. The pages, however, are already yellowed and brittle. It's a shame that the publisher (Crown) would decide to print such a timeless work on such worthless paper. Find in a better edition."
2,Lame,"I'll be honest -- I thought this book was lame. Some of the stories were pretty good, but others (especially the chapter on Angels) were really stupid. The story about the key to the magic garden was extremely terrible. If you like the unknown, I would suggest reading other books and dodging this waste of time."
5,Strong and easy to use.,This is a great product. Very easy to remove and I feel very secure using it.
2,Well made but Sapphire color is nothing like the photo.,The color of these in the photo show a nice bright blue but the actual sapphires I got were a dark grey-blue. I bought other sapphires before and know they can be slightly different color blue but these are some of the dullest looking I've bought.
3,Full of Strange Typos,"I have no problem with the novel. It was a fast read.I do have a problem with the Kindle edition. It must have been scanned using character recognition software from a print copy and then not proof read. The book is rife with strange words in the middle of sentences and typographic errors. The software must have particularly had a problem scanning the word ""die"". There were several places where the word ""die"" would fit in the sentence and we got words like ""the"" in its place. I was mostly able to fill in the wrongly scanned words but it was jarring to read."
4,The Parsifal Mosaic Review,"This is a very good book. It has plenty of suspense and action, and a little romance for spice. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the spy thrillers."
3,The Parsifal Mosaic,"The story line is good although a little longwinded, however I find the Kindle version peppered with typing errors to such an extent that I had to skip a few lines at a time, in lots of places throughout the book, as they just didn't make sense, of course it ruined the story and the plot. ""he moved the knife black"" now, is that, ""he moved the black knife""? or is it ""he moved the knife back""? no, it's ""he moved the knife blade"" ?? and after you have had a lot of these distractions you just lose heart.Correct the typos and you have a good Ludlum story."
3,A triumph of form over content,"A former field agent of the CIA is hunted down by both his former employees and a fanatic branch of the KGB. In spite of being all alone, he succeeds in eluding both establishments until he discovers the reason, which I am sorry to say is absolutely rediculous.The details of the hunt is extremely exciting though and makes this book very attractive until you discover the silly plot near the end, hence it becomes rather boring"
2,Tough One,"This was a tough one to get through. Slow moving and a bit confusing for the first half. Picks up eventually, but wading through 400 pages to get there is a bit tedious."
2,Kindle edition...Too many typos,"An ok book, starts out a bit slow, but moves along after about a quarter of the way in.My justification for 2 stars is the kindle book is full of typos. You can tell where 'replace all' was used.... Yon for you, etc. it really messes up the reading flow particularly when a sentence ends with 'the'. Sometime the poor editing leads one to wonder it the author's intended word is accurate or if the crossover from hardcopy to soft introduced the error, especially when some of the words/ phrases are a bit archaic (at least in the 201Xs)."
2,Don't Know Why,"I have purchased numerous e-books for my Kindle. All have been received quickly and without problem. This book was received as usual but contained so many errors in spelling and punctuation that is was troublesome to read. I have read several books my R. Ludlum and enjoyed them but this e-book version was the only one I have ever encountered with these problems. Of course, these errors will not prevent one from enjoying the story but they are most distracting."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"An embiterred agent whose lover has been killed, or so he thinks, quits his job and goes walkabout, basically. When he finds out she is alive an perhaps a double agent, he wants back in the game.Consular Operations wants to get rid of him, but the Russians deny to him that his wife is one of their agents.When he finds his wife, she bolts, thinking that he is a double agent, because of information she has been fed.On top of this, the US Secretary of State if completely starkers, and was once one of our protagonists advisers.The partners manage to work it out, and get the ear of the present and some of his men, and realise that along with the nutso go, there is also a mole in the State department, and the two sides square off over the country."
3,"Good story, hard to follow at times","This book takes the reader through a lot of twists and turns. While riveting, it is hard to follow at times."
1,Typos,I bought the kindle edition of this book. This review is purely over the kindle edition. Numerous typos and misspellings thought the kindle edition. I know because I own both the book and kindle edition of it. Come on Amazon!
3,Decent... But.,"The actual Sash Lock is great. Appears to be made of decent quality material and painted nicely. However the screws that were included to install were complete garbage (hence the 3/5 stars.) The heads of the screws were dipped/painted in the same color of the locks, which I appreciate, but the coloring material (paint I think) clogged up the screw holes making them unusable. It required me going to the hardware store and picking up a few black finishing screws, which should have been included to begin with."
2,a look at punk rock,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Border Radio is a student film made by Allison Anders who later went on to direct episodes of ""Sex and the City"" and other TV shows.The film is about a group of musicians who track down a thief hiding in Mexico. The film is not very good in my opinion and probably would only appeal to fans of punk rock.The DVD has a lot of special features also.There are deleted scenes, two audio commentaries: one with the directors and one with the cast. A making of documentary, a music video of the group portrayed in the film, a theatrical trailer and radio spot, and biographies of the cast and crew"
3,The View of a News Reporter,"This book is the work of a news reporter who researched the work of Carston Thiede, a German paleographist, and bought into Thiede's theory that two papyri of the Gospel of Matthew should be redated from the end of the 2nd century to the mid 1st century.Concerning the substance of d'Ancona's story, Thiede's theory that P64 and 67 are not connected to P4 is given some credence by other scholars such as Comfort. However Thiede's paleographical dating methods are found to be selective; certain letters are compared and certain other letters which would contradict Thiede's theory are not compared. (Klaus Wachtel wrote about this is in a German publication in 1995.)D'Ancona's book rates three stars because of the depth of information he includes on paleography and ancient writing practices. However it should be noted that few scholars acceptThiede's theory."
3,Slow and allegedly filled with faulty data,"I found the book to be rather dreary and sleepy in it's presentation and stucture. Though for a 'papyrologist' it may be an action filled, sweaty-palmed book, so I guess it's all perspective. That is my major complaint. Though I picked up the basic arguments of Thiede's thesis, it could have been a 10 page essay for all that I needed (as in detail level).I've heard from at least two sources that his thesis has been shot down and debunked by recent discoveries (The book came out in 1994). I am very interested in if this book still has strong arguments and thesis' presented. If someone knows where I can find info about the alleged debunking of Thiede's thesis please email me (institutemr@hotmail.com). I wouldn't say this book warrent's a purchase, but it's worth a read if it can be found for free (i.e. library)."
1,"Horrible Sound Quality MP3, Buyer Beware!",The CD of Showstoppers is not easy to find so I was thrilled when I saw that the MP3 was available. What a disappointment.I don't know how this recording was done but I did better ones holding up my tape recorder to the TV back in 1984. Don't waste the money. I hope someday I can find this on CD.
3,Sizing Chart Problem,"This product looks nice, and is a well known brand, but the ""click here sizing chart"" is for people, not dogs ! Without (canine) sizing information, it is hard to know what to order, especially for a mid-sized dog, who might fall into either the large or the small category. I hope someone will fix this silly listing error.I apologize in advance for the fact that, strictly speaking, this is not a true product review. I will delete this review if the problem with this listing is fixed. I chose three stars in an effort not to bias the ratings any more than I can help, and even that will go away when I delete the review."
2,VERY Poor understrap,Belly straps don't secure the load and constantly need to be tightened... especially when wet. Not recomended for hikes over a few miles or any hike with rugged terrain. When loose (often) unit falls forward over dog's head when heading down hill. If serious about this I suggest spending a few dollars more. Will keep mine and modify to accomodate weakness.
1,"Well constructed, bad design.","Just back from Backpacking in Sierras. This dog pack performed terribly. I have a 115 pound dog and used the large size pack. It kept falling off, slipping over his head and shoulders when he bent down or when descending steep switchbacks, which you do a lot of in the Sierras. Luckily I had some bungie cords and could tighten it enough to keep from coming off, but that caused my dogs skin to get rubbed raw. Thought Kelty was a top of line outfit, but this dogpack is designed for short walks in a city park. Very amateurish and I was very disappointed. Kind of makes all their products suspect if this is an example. Don't think I'll be running out to buy any Kelty equipment in the future."
4,Great Dog Backpack,Great backpack for the money. I have a 40 lbs english springer spaniel and a small fits just fine. Good quality pack! Only gripe is that the pack needs to be filled evenly so it doesn't slide to one side.
2,Doesn't Do a thing,"Fact is, there are no power gains, and the car probably performs worse with it on. Not a great investment for the money. Don't spend money on an intake, not worth it."
4,"If you're a Parrothead, you'll love this album","I listen to a lot of ""trop-rock"" artists and have just recently started focusing on Brent Burns' music. This is a great album. It makes me want to sit at a beach bar, have a few drinks, and enjoy the atmosphere. If you love Buffett and Buffett-like music, you'll enjoy this."
4,the BEST - next to Jimmy B !!!,"I heard my 1st Brent Burns CD while in Gulf Shores, AL several years ago. His music has the same *effect* as any Jimmy Buffett (well, almost)... It's great music."
3,William Keighley directed the film with a firm and fresh efficiency...,"Following his brutal portrayal in ""The Petrified Forest,"" Bogart became a much more articulate and calculating killer in ""Bullets or Ballots,"" a gangster thriller starring Edward G. Robinson as a crusading crime-buster, modeled after true-life cop Johnny Broderick, known as ""the toughest cop on Broadway,"" who pretended to be thrown off the police force in order to infiltrate Bogart's gang and get the evidence to bring him to justice...Bogart revealed no emotion whatever as he goes about his gun-happy chores of shooting a respected newspaperman as well as his partner-in-crime, Barton MacLane, in his characteristic double-cross...The exciting finale found both Bogart and Robinson in a blazing showdown, an unusual ending for this period in film history, but one which Robinson had fought hard to retain...William Keighley directed the film with a firm and fresh efficiency..."
5,A Visual Masterpiece,"I saw this for a college class on Shakespeare. Initially, I wasn't too thrilled with having to watch a Russian black and white rendition of King Lear, but changed my mind soon after I started watching the film. This is a very faithful telling of Shakespeare's classic that will draw you in and entertain you. The acting is superb and the visuals are wonderful."
4,"Good mood and backdrops, good acting, good direction, not good dubbing","If your Russian is not good and have to depend on the dubbing or just the subtitles then it is not great. The dubbing should have had different readers, especially for the female roles. Having the same reader for all actors and not being synchronized made it difficult for me to follow the intent of the author. I suspect I missed many of the nuances, as I am not anywhere as familiar with King Lear as with many of Shakespeare's other plays."
5,Great product!,"Latches fit perfectly, as stated. They look great and are good quality. Would definately recommend to customers looking for replacement latches!"
2,Engañado,"Pedi robusto El Ridge 11.210,01 la segun foto dobservaciones Sí onde Que Lleva Una llaves , Pero El producto Que me enviaron no era Por nada Lo pedicura Que . Me Siento robado ."
2,Not as great as it seems!,"The photos are great, and the language is kept simple. Beyond that this book has little to offer. It insists on a particular growing method without informing about other methods. The authors insistence upon using Metal Halides over High Pressure Sodium lighting is mind boggling. While most of the book is written in a simple and easily understood manner, the chapter on fertilizers contains more jargon than a PHD thesis. Use your money to buy a better book."
4,Now I Feel I Know Eva By Heart,"This book was everything I had hoped it would be. What I particularly enjoyed was how it was told by the people in her life who knew her best. After reading ""Songbird,"" I feel I now know Eva by heart."
5,Great Product!,Cool to find out she grew up just down the road from me as I was persuing my own musical endevours.
3,Size ran small,"I ordered two of these shirts, one in white and one in gray, but I returned them because they did not seem true to size. They felt one size smaller. Otherwise, they seemed like they would have been nice shirts for working out at the gym."
1,Sizes are off,"I am totally agreeing with another poster about the size problem. I ordered a XL and it is more like a Medium. Very unhappy. Don't go by the sizing chart, it doesn't hold true. I doubt I will order a Reebok item again. A customer shouldn't have to pay shipping an item back that is not as descibed..."
2,well made but not that functional...,"I usually love MSR products, but this one is disappointing. It's well made but the nozzle on the end of this shower is pretty lame. I understand you're not gonna get a full blast of water in a camp shower in order to conserve water but this shower gives you a weak trickle. I love MSR products but this one is just ok IMO"
2,waste of time,Paul van Dyk is great. Check out Politics I and II.But this CD is a waste of time. Who wants to listen to the same track over and over mixed every which way?
4,Two Kirk Douglas westerns,"These 2 westerns both have Kirk Douglas in them. OK Corral co stars Burt Lancaster and Gun Hill has Tony Quinn in it. Of the 2 Gun Hill is the much better film. Good acting and interesting plot with good pacing. If you are a western fan you will no doubt be able to figure the plot but you will still enjoy it.As for the OK Corral, it is a disjointed waste of talent that I just couldn't sit thru. I had hoped for something more than this fabrication of one of the few documented shootouts of the old west.My suggestion is that if you can find the Gun Hill by itself at a good price just buy it."
1,Last train from Gunhill,Last train from Gunhill-I am very disapointed in the quality of the product.The picture froze halfway through viewing.All attempts to get it back on track failed.Even cleaning the disc with a cleaning solution did not help.Henry-Western Cape (RSA)
5,Canadian Guitar Hero,"Guitar hero Walter Rossi was a favorite of mine, and most air guitarists of the 70s. Reputed to be a protégé of Hendrix, Rossi beat out Bryan Adams for Most Promising Male Vocalist in the 1981 Junos, Canada's version of the Grammies. But make no mistake about it, Rossi bears no resemblance to that generic songster; rather he is both a master of jazz and power-cord rock, with a bluesy, Paul Rodgers'like voice; a fusion of Santa and Bad Company."
5,A pleasure from start to finish!,"I first heard of Amanda Wilkinson through my American friend, who is a Country fan. I was hooked, and had to get my own copy of this CD. It is beautiful--a wonderful mix of uptempo and ballads, love gone wrong and love just right... She hits all the right notes!I'm a New Zealander living in Japan, and know very little about Country. But if I liked this, then I think nearly everyone would!"
4,Rocky Horror: Creatures of the Night II,"I really enjoyed flipping through this book. (Well, of course, I enjoy anything about Rocky Horror.) The pictures in this book are outstanding. I enjoyed the photographs of all the different casts from the US and throughout the rest of the world. Some of the information got a bit tedious, but overall it was a wonderful volume."
4,FUN< FILLED FANTASTIC w/ LAUGHTER AND ENJOYMENT,"When I first saw the movie, I had to buy it, then I wanted to have more laughter, so I bought the book. The book is way funny. Of course Tim Curry, in the movie, is an enjoyment to listen to, so you don't get crack-me-up on the floor laughter, you get a surprise laughter. BUY THIS BOOK!!!"
4,Decent DVD player - Can be made Region Free,"This is a decent DVD player, nothing too fancy about it. It does not have HDMI connection. The great thing about this, however, it's that it can be made to play DVDs from all regions. All you need to do is to input the region code by typing it on the remote. Search for the code on the internet with the DVD player model number."
4,"reads everything ,BUT...","i guess it is good for the price , but i cannot read HD so if i knew ,because it says, reads everything , i would have spent a little more and get a HD dvix player ,like that i will be able to play everything ,, but it is a good one though , it loads fast and the quality is good it is small and slick ,you just burn 5 or 6 movies on one DVD or DVD-RW and you are good to go ... i hope i helped you decide on this product , i still recommend it ."
5,Great DivX/Xvid Playback,"I use this unit purely for watching DivX/Xvid AVI files burned onto CD-R media. Sound and video playback is flawless, and it handles subtitles very nicely as long as you follow the directions in the manual. I love the small size too."
4,Very very price effective,"What a nice find. It is easily made multi region (see other reviews). The DVD tray can be controlled with the remote, also. To open or close the DVD tray with the remote, hold down the STOP button for 3 or 4 seconds. This player is a very good bargain when you can find it in the $30 range. Progressive scan is a great feature. It's cheap and it works."
3,works so far....,I bought this wanting a DVD player upstairs since we only had one in our basement... but since our tv was an older tv upstairs it didn't have the correct equipment to hook it up... we had to move our other player from down stairs up to the old tv....it works fine but am alittle frustrated it wasn't very versitile with our tv setup...
1,dvd player died after 6 months,Unfortunately this dvd player doesn't work properly after 6 months. It has a green line on the top with multiple picture distortions while it plays.Yes. I can still see hat is playing but with disappointing quality and I'm nervous for how long more.We are looking for a replacement...
4,Pretty great for the price.,It does what I wanted it to so I'm happy with it. I wanted a DVD player that would play .avi files and could not find a single one that I could actually afford. I tried my luck with this and it plays them! The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because it will occasionally take a couple of opening and closing the drawer for a burned DVD to load.
4,Pretty good,I bought for DVP3140 for it's cheap price and support for multiple formats. So far it has worked very well and the quality of the picture is pretty good so there is nothing to complain about really.
1,Total Disaster,"The Philips Compact DVD Player turned out to be a total disaster. It worked for all of one day, after which the laser burnt out and the player was unusable. Since I had made modifications of the region code to make it ""multi-region,"" based on what I thought was legitimate advice from other users, Philips said it was no longer under warranty."
4,NP,Biggest prob I have had with this product is learning how to do rewind and FF. You can do it my track or normal--- Also time search is awkward but I am still getting used to it and I am sure this will be a great DVD player-- the biggest test will be when I burn a CD--- Just haven't gotten around to it yet LOL.
1,"Philips customer ""service""? Ha!","Bought a Philips DVD player, opened the box, plugged it in... the dvd drawer would not come out of the machine. It would constantly stick. Called Philips, spent almost half an hour on the phone with both the customer ""service"" rep and her supervisor. They told me I would have to pay (over $10!) to return their faulty merchandice to them.This in spite of their product having a ""passed inspection"" sticker on it. Why should I have to pay $10+ to return a $35 dvd player because they sent me a broken product? I will NEVER buy another Philips product as long as I live! You might want to consider how accommodating they are before you shell out hundreds or thousands of dollars on any of their other products. A company is only as good as their products AND their service. When it comes to Philips, in my opinion (and experience!), they both stink!"
1,This is useless garbage. Please do not purchase.,"This unit is junk. I had 5 DVDs in the house and it would not play any of them. It would play a CD. I tried all the troubleshooting in the manual and called customer service. They were in India, rude, and not helpful at all. I always thought Phillips products were high quality, but not anymore. I sent it back."
5,Wonderful little DVD player for the price.,Anything that comes out of the box and you put it together without instructions and everything works correctly is almost impossible in this day and age. I did this with this DVD player and it seems to work as well as my expensive Sony in the living room that does everything. All I wanted was a bedroom DVD for exercise and watching Netflix movies and it does that just great. It can't be beat for the price. I have no complaints.
3,"Great price, feels cheap, works great","Maybe I'm getting older, but when I picked up the box it was shipped in I didn't know a DVD Player could be so light. I guess its not groundbreaking technology anymore. This product feels cheap when you pick it up. It does look nice though and I've had no problems with its operation. I guess its a good value for the price, 3 stars only because I am hard to please."
1,Video output doesn't work,"The video output on this dvd player was spotty at first. A blue screen would flicker in and out while i was playing dvds. Now, after about 6 months, the video output doesn't work at all and I get a blue screen all the time."
4,Plain and simple,"This DVD player works exactly as I expected it to. It was very simple to setup, very simple to connect, and very simple to operate. No ""bells and whistles"", but that's not what I was looking for. It works great."
2,Poor quality,"Very disappointing; on/off & tray buttons don't respond well; brand new remote had to be replaced. Phillips very accomodating; swapped unit with no questions asked, but as they say...you get what you pay for. I'll probably need to replace this within the year."
1,Junk,The DVD quit working after 4 months. Completely dead. I plan to call Philips and see what they can do.
5,Xcellent Product,I have several products from Philips and like the others this is another excellent product from Philips. This has played anything I have put in it (well almost anything). I purchased two of these.
1,Dont buy did not last a year,"We bought this dvd player and used it maybe once a week, it is up and away from the kids so we were very gentle with it... two things have happened first if it was on for a while the picture would turn greenish then I would turn it off then on again to solve that problem, then one day at about 8 month point the motor just stopped... it could never play another DVD again, I tried to contact the people that sold it to me on amazon and asked what they recommend I do and never heard back from them. go figure!if you want a cheap player and are fine with replacing it after 6 or so months then go for it... oh one more thing there is no scanning forward really bc it hard to do and jumps from chapter to chapter which if very annoying if you are trying to find a specific part you will get frustrated!"
1,JUNK!! Don't waste your money,The minute I hooked it up and turned it on I didn't like the picture. My old vhs tapes looked clearer. Dvds that play fine on my other 4 players would studder at times on this unit sporadically. Bottom line grainy picture and unreliable playing. Not worth even the cheap price.
2,Defective Unit,"After anxiously awaiting arrival of this unit, when I got it, I was highly disappointed. After going thru everything needed for the hook up, and trying to use unit to view new DVD i also bought, the door would not open to receive the dvd. i tried opening it both from the unit itself, and from the remote. Called phillips support, and finally had to send it back to Amazon. I am not gonna order another one!"
1,Playback weak,"I bought this unit to play burned MP3 discs and DVD-R movies. None of them play very well. Dissapointed with Philips, I thought it was a decent brand. I have since purchased another brand and all is well."
1,"Works fine for a month, then expect trouble!",I've owned this player for a little over a month. The remote is very small and does not light up. The worst thing about this player is that it has recently developed a problem where it will only play certain dvds and only certain parts of dvds (ie. sometimes it will play the movie but not the extras). I am incredibly disappointed. I had never owned a philips product before and will hesitate before buying one again.
2,Mixed...,"Well, I've only had my dvd player for a few weeks and used it about 5 times or so, but I've already had a few problems..The menu loads slowly, one time the 'open' button refused to work, whether I pressed the remote button or pushed it on the dvd player. The last time I used it, it wouldn't even turn on..I had to unplug it/plug it back in, and then it worked, strangely...the Philips brand batteries they included w/ it died on the third day inside the remote, if that's any indication..this thing was cheap and looks nice but I don't expect it to last very long."
5,Great ease of use,"A definite must buy!! It is easy to use, but need a little getting use to as the remote does not have an eject button, and can't play frame by frame."
3,"Basic, all format player","Great bang for the buck. Can play virtually any format of DVDs (not including new formats like Blue Ray, etc...) The tray to load DVDs seem flimsy."
4,A Solid Performer,"This product has performed reliably so far, although I have had limited experience with it. The only con I have is the DVD tray is very flimsy. You'd better be very careful with it."
4,Good read.,"This one started off a bit slowly. The pace picked up, but it is a deliberate pace throughout.The jacket had comparisons to Carl Hiaasen, but I did not really see that. Hiaasen's recent works have been peopled by characters that have become cartoonish and parodies. The characters in ""Deadly Sweet"" are far more plausable.The main players are believeable and the plot makes sense. The comic element that Hiaasen brings is not present here, and to me that was a major plus.It never becomes a fast read or a ""page turner"" in the strict sense. It progresses at a logical pace and the loose ends are tied up. The protagonists are easy to cheer for and it's easy to feel their losses along the way.I enjoyed it. However, I felt the Hiaasen comparisons were off base, but that was a positive. Maybe reviewers think any novel set in Florida is Hiaasenesque."
4,Eye Opening,I liked the perspective and could easily see how a young man could become hardened to the cruelty of war. This is one of the stories that so many veterans could not talk about and I can now see why. I'm very glad I read it.
4,I studied this book in my first circuits class in college,"I thought it was pretty good in terms of keeping the reader involved and encouraged. However, some typos made it very frustrating. My professor warned me that some of the provided answers to problems are incorrect. it has valuable insight and good coverage of basic real life examples for beginners. starts with basic definitions and laws. established the basics first, then builds on applications."
1,Bad Handles,"The telescoping handles do not lock properly in place so any time pressure is put on either the scoop or the scraper, the handles collapse down. I'm not sure what they use for adhesive for the hand grips, but it is oily. When the weather warms up at all, it leaks from under the hand grip and runs down the handle which ends up on your fingers. When hung by the loop on the hand grip, the handles have slid out of the hand grip leaving the tools to fall to the floor. I have found a garden rake and a sand shovel much more useful in cleaning up my yard."
4,Product works as it is designed to,"Depending on the level of fleas on your pet, or in the pet's environment- this does the trick. I have had to redip in 2-4 weeks as the fleas are not killed out of the house yet."
1,Poorly made,"No doubt this story is a classic, but the way the book is made is terrible. I just got this in the mail today and the binding is coming off since the adhesive does not stick. The pages are stapled together and the hard cover is in fact rough cardboard. I will not keep this book...each time I touch it I'm afraid of getting a paper cut!"
4,The Kingdom of God,"One of the features of this book that really caught my attention was the handling of the Kingdom of God as it realtes to believers in Christ. Permeating a decent study of Christology is the theme that we are living in a pseudo reality. Jesus Christ is calling us out of it and into the Kingdom of God. Do not expect to find anything like a comprehensive presentation of Christology in this book, but you may expect to find a brief but intersting look at some of the central issues surrounding Christ, as well as practical suggestions for applying what was gleaned from those applications to your life."
1,NO MORE SCALLIONS!,"Has anyone really tried the Scallion Tart recipe? Martha wants 8 BUNCHES of scallions cut into match stick pieces. Hey Martha this made birds nests on my tartlets. My daughter grabbed one to go and called me down the road. ""Hey MOM it tastes really good but I feel like I'm chewing grass. Am I going to colic after I eat this? We cooked half at a time so before the second pan went in the oven we removed two thirds of the scallions. This batch made it so you could actually taste the olives and walnuts. So Martha did you really mean 8 BUNCHES?"
3,Die-hard bakers will enjoy this book,"I've tried a number of the recipies in this book, and they are excellent! Most of mine however, didn't turn out.These recipies are not for the faint of heart. For those of us raised in the cake-mix generation, be forewarned -- most of these recipies require more than one hour of workIf you're a die-hard pie and tart baker, you should pick up a copy of this book. Good luck!"
4,"Easy to follow, consistently delicious","So far, I have made one pie and one tart from this book. Both came out beautifully and deliciously. Savory recipes are also included. I'm buying a copy for a friend who is a baking newbie- I think the clear directions and inspirational photography will lure her to the oven more often."
1,Martha Stewart isn't all she is cracked up to be.,"I like the concept of what the Martha Stewart organization is trying to portray. I think that our generation needs to learn how they can make things themselves instead of relying on others to make them. However, I am very disappointed in almost every single recipe that I have tried to make from the Martha Stewart cookbooks. This particular book calls for some hard-to-find ingredients with no options for the people who can't find or obtain them.I realize that the people who bake these pies and tarts for the book are professionals and have had a lot of food styling done to them but what the average person is capable of making at home is no where near what you see in the book.It seems this book was printed as another tool to promote the Martha Stewart organization. It was not done to help the average consumer, like it seems the MS organization is portraying itself to be. This is a very disappointing book."
5,Freeez Punk,"The song got to number 2 in Britain in June 1983. The album it's from was also called I.O.U. If you're having trouble getting hold of the song it was recently released on the Now That's What I Call Music 1983. (Millennium Series)It was a great funk single. The song reminds me of a great summer. Blue Monday, Fascination and True were also in the charts alongside it. Maybe the best song not to get to number one that year."
4,A Solid First Novel!,"An easy-reading murder mystery set in Osaka, Japan. Entertaining Japanese and American characters, engaging plot. Just the right mix of story and Japanese background info. Highly recommended for anyone that either likes unique mysteries or is interested in Japan. A big thumbs up!Let's hope for more of detective Eric Thor's adventures!"
1,Disappointing,"I bought this because it was Analon, which I love. However, the can opener is not what I would have hoped for. It takes the top part of the label off which gets into whatever you are opening. It is also wearing out already and I haven't had it very long and don't use it all the time."
2,Not Pink,"Don't get me wrong, I actually enjoy this product. For me, it has worked really well on a number of fabrics. BUT, when I order a pink blindly from their catalog, I expect it to be an actual pink. This ""pink"" is actually more of a fuchsia or maroon. I would expect their pink to be almost a baby pink or cotton candy pink, but this isn't. If you are looking for more of a baby pink, you are honestly going to have to buy the fluorescent pink and then add a bunch of white to it."
3,"Better Without ""Tribute""","This CD hardly sounds like a Tribute to Linkin Park. After a song or two of listening it starts to get boring. It doesn't have any flavor, and no ""mood"" I guess you can call it to the music. Sometimes I couldn't even tell that it was Linkin Park song, they play it differently or something. I do not recommend buying this CD"
1,doesn't hold a candle.,"like the other people said, this CD doesn't do linkin park any justice. what is that scratching noise? is that linkin park country style? no. please don't even waste your money on this."
1,WTH,It's sad to see what people are doing to Linkin Park. If your going to make a Tribute Cd make it right The Quarterlet Tribute sounds a little more descent if you ever wanted a soft version of Linkin Park.
4,garys step,garys step is a really great song....Sonnys outbursts and Lindas vocals makes even the dull band in the background kind of cool...
2,Cheap Read,"I looked forward to reading this book, especially given David Halterstam's track record of in-depth exploration of his subjects. I am interested in football, coaching, success, and ways to motivate and educate. Unfortunately, this book falls short of the mark. It reads more like a fan's guide to a coach's family background than it does an examination of Bill Belichick's unique methods of achieving victories on the football field. Indeed, Belichick's apparent limitations in the personality/charisma department would seem to lend themselves to detailed exploration of how he has done what he's done with the New England Patriots. But if that's what you're looking for, you'll have to wait for another author to take up this subject. Halberstam's work disappoints."
4,"easy, informative read",As always Halberstam thoroughly researched his topic and provided an informative and interesting book about an individual who has fascinated NFL fans for several years. Its a great time of year to read it.
2,Disappointment,"In the past I've really enjoyed Halberstam's books, but I found this one to be surprisingly uninteresting. He seemed to be repeating everything to the screaming point. I lasted till about page 50 when I bailed."
1,A waste of Halberstam's ability.,"It is a measure of just how dull and unintersting a person Bill Belichick seems to be that not even David Halberstam can make him interesting. The trajectory of Belichick's life goes something like this: son of a coach, never wanted to be anything but a coach, surrounded himself with others who wanted to be coaches, became a coach. There just isn't much else there, and without additional insight into his personality, the book is basically an extended version of Belichick's resume. Halberstam's writing is, as always, very readable, but the editing of the book seemed a bit weak. There are several sections that are repeated almost verbatim in different parts of the book. Perhaps when the subject is as dull as Belichick, one has to repeat what few good anecdotes are available to try to make the book more interesting..."
3,"Ok, but slightly disappointing","While I'm an unabashed Patriots fan, I was hoping to read more about Belichick's time with the Giants and his first head coaching stint with the Browns. Halberstam does a decent job discussing Steve Belichick, and how he handed on his love of coaching football to his son. The book then goes into decent detail of Belichick's time at Andover. From there though, the book becomes uneven, glossing over some details when he was an assistant coach. As another reader mentioned earlier, I would have liked to read more about Belichick's interactions with not just Lawrence Taylor, but also other Giant defensive players of that era. Still, it was an enjoyable read overall."
3,Good book but a little boring,"I'm not sure what the book's intention was, but be prepared to read more about life events instead of football related events. I read this after the Tony Dungy book, and I would recommend that over this book."
3,Fascinating and disappointing,"I picked this book up with great expectation which initially was met. And I learned a great deal about the man and some quite inteesting anecdotes. However, the more I read the more irritated I became with the many repetitions, some revisiting the same scene within pages.I think Halberstam has produced a very good draft against the standard I expect from him. Either his editor was asleep at the switch or he rushed the project. In either case, I don't think it serves his subject well and certainly does not reflect the discipline, work ethic, and attention to detail which are hallmarks of Coach Belichick."
3,Super Genius,"I don't normally read biographies of recent championship winning coaches because usually they are puff pieces to allow the coach to cash in while he is still hot. When I saw that this book was written by David Halberstam however, I decided to risk it. To mix metaphors, this was certainly not a home run for Halberstam. My main criticism of the book is that Halberstam seemed to fall in love with Belichick and portray him as a super genius even from his earliest coaching days. This grows tiresome quickly. The back story about Belichick's father is interesting but he too is portrayed as some football savant. There is very little to balance the love-fest, but fortunately the book is well written, as you would expect from Halberstam, and short enough to hold your attention."
4,"Great Book, but suffers from ""Fluff Stuff""","I think this book provided me (at least) with an excellent background of Belichick, effectively filling in the parts about him I didn't know about. I've been a strong Pats fan since Kraft bought the team.While this book did contain a lot of factual material, I feel it suffered from ""Fluff Stuff"" or excessive rants about Belichick and/or his coaches, influences, etc. If you removed the ""Fluff"" I think it would be down to about 200 pages."
1,Halberstam's worst,"I've read several of his books (although this was my first sports book of his) and I highly enjoyed them. Maybe it's because the subject is just not a very interesting person, but this book is just terrible. He tells us material that contributes nothing; who cares about about his grandparents and his wife family? He also gushes about the subject and his family. Is everything really so great? It's as if he chose an average person at random and wrote a biography about him. The average person doesn't lead a particularly fascinating life and the resulting biography would be dull. Just because he is a success as a coach doesn't necessarily make him a good candidate for a biography."
5,Beautiful Throw,Beautiful and rich looking in person. Picture does not do it justice. I am very happy with this purchase.
3,I like them,"Our Jack Russell Mags uses this when it's that time. It stays on her pretty well. She hated wearing it at first and would stick her but up at us to take it off. We kept it on her and it stays on her pretty good. She's a pretty active dog and our other Jack keeps trying to steal it. Anyway, I recommend it if you can find it for about 15 bucks. It'll stay pretty good if you get the right size. Mags is about 20 lbs and is a parson jack russell terrier. We use the medium for her. Fits pretty good.Good luck"
2,fell apart,"Initially these pants were fine. After a couple of washings the material separated from the edge binding. For the price, they were a disappointment."
2,Not worth it!!!,"We bought this vacuum a couple of years ago, because we were advised that it was suppose to in comparison to the dyson and half the price. It also advertised that it would never lose suction. The primary reason we bought it was because we have two labs and picking up dog hair is trully a problem.At first the unit work great. We were pretty impressed and happy with the unit. But, the pet attachment stopped working shortly after the warrant ran out. And after about two and half years, the vacuum is no long picking up dog hair like it use to. We now have to go over the same spot three or four times and we are still left with streaks of hair. We've taken good care of this vacuum too; cleaning the filters and the canister regularly. I would not recommend this vacuum. We are currently trying to decide between an Oreck or Dyson. We know people with both and they swear by them. They might cost more, but at least they come with decent warranties."
2,"high maintainance, heavy, low suction for the price.","My first problem with this product is its 24-cyclone part (located at the top of the machine). When you want to clean it you have to wash it. The problem is that you cannot use the machine if that part is wet and it does not dry for days once you wash it. The reason is that it is so tightly built the water left inside evaporates very very slowly. Basically, this is a high maintainance machine. It says on its ad ""Advanced cyclonic no loss of suction technology"". Well, I am willing to trade this technology with emptying the dust cup more frequently if it requires that much maintainance.Second, it is very heavy. I do not mind it but my girlfriend really hate to use it and everytime she complains about it.Third, I don't think that its suction is very good, especially for this price."
2,great vacuum when not broken,"In the 6 months I've owned this, I've had to replace the belt that powers the brush twice. Infinity says this is not covered under any warranty since it's normal wear a tear. I would hope that the belts would last more than a couple months since I only use it every other weekend in a 900 sq ft apartment. I got this vacuum since it has Dyson technology at half the price, but I should have saved my money. When I'm not waiting for the next belt to arrive in the mail (they aren't sold in stores), the vacuum does great and has great power. Unfortunately, I don't want to repeatedly spend $10 for new belts."
5,"It's just a vacuum, right?","Well that's what I thought too. I thought my husband was nuts (or just trying to be cheap) when he told me about this vac. I really wanted the Dyson Animal. I have to say... I am very glad I listened to him and checked it out.I spent the day yesterday shampooing and vacuuming my 1600 SF house. Today I decided I needed to replace my previous vac, because I am sick of taking the screwdriver out and taking it apart to remove the clogs. So I went out shopping and came home with this unit.I have re-done my whole house and I was shocked at how much this thing picked up. It almost made me blush, because I thought my house was clean!! It proved me wrong! I have 2 chihuahuas and 2 love birds to clean up after (Oh yeah, and a husband!)I love this vac, and for half the price of the Dyson that I have been wanting FOREVER, I say get this and go get yourself something really nice with the extra money that is left."
2,Poor suction,This vacuum has pretty poor suction. Have to make multiple passes to get all the dirt in.Dirt disposal is pretty awkward and the dirt cup capacity is too little.Pretty heavy and requires effort to use.
1,One of the WORST vacuums around,Can use for 12 minutes before it shuts itself off for an hour. It is extremely hard to clean out the canister. You need to use a fork and then you only get some of the debris. It all sticks to the screen and it constantly looks dirty and gross.
5,Awsome Vacume,I love this vacume it is by far the best I have ever had. I am getting ready to by a second one.
2,Not impressed,"I bought this thinking it would be a cheaper version of a Dyson. Guess I have to take the plunge and buy the real thing!After attaching the hose clip and inserting the telescopic handle, I did a quick pass on my living room carpet with my 10-year-old Hoover that I bought for $60 new. I didn't even change the almost full filter bag first. Then I vacuumed with the Infinity. It did get some more carpet fiber and pet hair out of the carpet, but not a significant amount. From what I have read about the Dyson, people are truly impressed and couldn't believe their carpets were that dirty. This was definitely not the case with the Infinity.With 3 kids under six, and 4 cats, I really think it should have found a lot more dirt than it did."
2,"Loose suction, hard to clean, and handle broke off","Works OK but loose suction fast, hard to clean canister, and handle broke off after couple months. I don't recommend this Infinity vacumn"
1,Good concept...poor design,I loved the idea of a pet care system becaue I can never get all the dog hair cleaned up well. I have had the infinity for 1 1/2 years and made several calls to the customer service department ( which was of course outsourced). Each time they could not help me unless I wanted to pay to ship it to them. The handle broke at one point and for $30 I can get a part shipped to me. The suction and vacuum stopped working and my husband had to take it apart to get it working again. It also does not stay upright. It is constantly falling down. Very poorly designed product! Do not buy!
2,Can't Get Replacement Parts and Clogs Easy,"I thought this would be a good vacuum to clean up all the hair from my three dogs. It cleans well but all other dealings have been a headache with this vacuum. First off, it picks up dog hair well but then you have to open the vacuum and clean out the clog the hair formed. I needed a belt to replace a broken one. Guess what! Bed, Bath and Beyond, Walmart, Sears, Lowe's, Target and Kmart do not sell belts for this vacuum, even if the company sells the vacuum. You can not get a belt for this vacuum from any website I have been able to find either including the comany's website. I finally contacted the company by phone and the only way to get a belt is to order through them and ofcourse it was three times as expensive than every other belt I saw at the above mentioned stored. If you are looking at buying a vacuum, I would not recommend this vacuum to a friend."
2,Won't hold up.,"There's no doubt that this vacuum has great suction power, picking up massive amounts of dog fur. Unfortunately, after only one week, I have to return it because:1. The dog hair it picked up is IMPOSSIBLE to empty from the chamber without reaching in with my hand or a stick.2. The belt already broke. Granted, it comes with one extra belt, but I have to wonder how long that will last if the first one lasted only one week."
2,The Upright that's A Little Up Tight,"The Euro-Pro NV31 Infinity Upright Vacuum Cleaner with Pet Care Systemis beautiful to look at and is certainly powerful but it's ability to maneuver easily and effortless is another question.To say that it is just right cumbersome does not describe it accurately. It's weight is a bit of a problem too,sorry"
1,Doesn't work for me,"I am not sure if it's me or the vacuum, but when I switched the mode from carpet to bare floor, it started blowing stuff out. For $200, I will get something better."
1,Infinity is Awful Do Not Buy,"I am returning my 2nd Infinity Vac to the store today. The 1st one worked great for about 2 weeks then it started having problems so I assumed that particular one was defective and exchanged it for a new one. I have had this Infinity 2 months which, after reading the other reviews seems to be this products shelf life, and it is not working right either. Like others, I also found the handle to be hard to snap back in and I worried it would break eventually b/c you had to mess with it so much to get it back in. This product is great at 1st but is clearly a bad design. I suspect anyone that wrote a good review on this product has not had it for at least 2 months."
1,Quel domage.,"I was fervently hoping that this was going to be a CD with the jazzy stylings of Charlie Biddle and his daughter Stephanie, who I saw (and loved) in The Whole Nine Yards--but, no! This is a very retro (to the '80s) and simplistic effort from Charlie Biddle JUNIOR--who sounds like a bad Ricky Martin in my estimation (and I adore Ricky's ""Vuelve,"" so don't get me wrong). Only one track, Marie Se Marie, held my interest, and that is because of the intriguing and jazzy trumpet riffs by Roger Walls in the background. Charlie, laisse votre pere vous aidez, dude!"
1,"Hard to find, but well worth it.","I was so excited to find Charlie Biddle on Amazon, that I didn't notice it was Charlie Biddle, JR. This was not what I expected at all."
4,imaginative and scary,clarke is great at putting a twist of horror and poetry into the universe unfolding around us in his trilogy of 4 books. i loved 2001 the best but the next two were worthy reads.
4,A Worth Follow Up Effort,The first book was so good in my opinion that reading the sequel was a must (especially since I liked the second movie so much more than the first). While that is my opinion about the movies I think that my opinion of the books is almost the reverse. The book continues the tension of the first and even increases the mystery. By the end of the book I would have thought the next one would really hit a home run and start answering some questions (the ones I thought would have been answered in this one).
4,"Good second part, but not as good as the first one","Although it is a good book, does not equal the first one (2001).I recommend reading first 2001, cause this book creates the questions you want answered in this second part (and not all of them are answered yet).2010 shows wonderful views and sights of space, specially Jupiter and its moons, that alone makes reading worth it, but, as I said above, it is more enjoyable once you read 2001."
5,"As good story, better characters","In the sequel to 2001: A space odyssey, we once again meet Heywood Floyd. However, all the other astronauts are new characters, and one quickly notices how original and colourful they are /while still remaining fully realistic).There's the commander, Tanya Orlova. Dr Chandra, who constructed HAL 9000 and has stronger feelings for it than for people, Walter Curnow, an anthropomorphic personification of the word ""jolly"", and many others.And it is their task to go and investigate Discovery in their fine vessel called LEONOV. But strange things will happen...This is an incredibly good book. It is well-written, and it is obvious that Mr Clarke has used the book medium in a way impossible with other works."
3,Great depth but not near 2001,"2010: Odyssey Two has great depth but fails to live up to the brilliance of 2001: A Space Odyssey.Even though Clarke still raises profound philosophical questions, creates a broad story and keeps proposing believable fiction he's somehow lost his touch on this one, in this book I didn't really felt the panic and the awe I felt on 2001: A Space Odyssey. There are some big lagoons between the really good parts and they don't allow the book to reach a crescendo. However the book is *not* boring at all it does takes the story a step further and Clarke's imagination and his point of view on the cosmos continues to be really interesting. Definitely worth reading if you liked the first installment, just don't expect it to be a masterpiece like 2001 was."
3,Very good; but not as good as 2001,"2010: Odyssey Two is a very good book. It is not, however, of the same caliber as 2001: A Space Odyssey. 2001 is a thought provoking, philosophical novel which raises issues such as the nature and origin of mankind, the difference between man and artificial intelligence, extra-terrestrial life, etc while 2010 mainly deals with war and the nature of politics (not quite as interesting to me). I would recommend this book to any true science fiction fan but don't expect it to be as good as 2001."
4,Clarke starts a sequel series of his most famous novel.,"The Odyssey series now numbers 4 books. 2010: Odyssey Two was the first sequel. It used the time-tested marketing ploy of a similar title: 2001 vs. 2010, to gain attention. It worked, and fortunately, it lived up to its billing.Odyssey two takes us to the next series of events following the climatic finale of 2001. How Jupiter starts the life on it's satellites into high gear, and how mere earthlings respond to this.A worthy successor to 2001."
3,A followup on the first book,"I must admit, 2010 is a very interesting book.The book seems to be more interested in explaning its cryptic predecessor rather than being its own book with its own storyline. The author apparantly wanted to leave the reader in wonder by leaving open many parts of the first book."
4,Very exciting!,This book was very exciting and suspensful. I enjoyed it more than 2001 because it had more action.I look forward to reading 2061.
4,"A Great book, but no contest with 2001.","First off, I would like to state that I was disappointed with Arthur Clarke's decision to make the book a sequel to the movie instead of to the novel version of 2001: A Space Odyssey. The novel version is somewhat more interesting and complex and should have been the base for the sequel. That said, 2010 is a great book, although slow at times. There are many revelations about the nature of the monolith and it's new creations of Hal 9000 and Dave Bowman, while at the same time creating more questions than are answered. A novel worthy of Arthur Clarke."
3,A good book.....sheds some light,"This isn't the best book i've ever read, but I liked where Clarke took the storyline. It kind of spoils the mystery of 2001, but at the same time (after reading the entire series) I got the feeling that Clarke himself didn't truly know where to take this storyline. I would recommend this book if you are interested in the storyline, but I don't recommend reading past this one. The last two are a waste of time, and don't add to the story whatsoever."
3,"Good, interesting but not revealing","Better than 2001, you need to read this one. If you read the 2 follow-ups you will understand the book/"
3,Mediocre ending,"After reading Childhood's End, I'm not so sure I'm as big a fan of Clarke I thought I was. Odyssey Two was interesting to say the least. I loved the description of the monolith on one of Jupiter's moons and the mind-bending dimensions of it, etc. However, I couldn't help but feel that the ending was childish. I didn't like the idea of Jupiter becoming another sun, making it constant daylight on Earth. To me, it just sounded like something a 3rd-grader would think of. All in all, I don't find the Clarke books I've read to be anything near that of Bradbury. Sorry Clarke."
4,What's up with EPCOT?,"In this case, I'd say that the film is better than the book. I have a few complaints about the book. It bothers me that Clarke caved to the plot of the movie, 2001, and removed the whole bit about going to Saturn from Jupiter. It leaves his first book standing alone. Books and movies diverge all the time and he should have just stuck to his original storyline for the sequels.My second complaint: what's up with the EPCOT retirement home? It's a completely hokey idea and distracting from the overall flow of the story."
5,CLASSIC Clarke,"Excellent progression of an epic tale that's near-futuristic, sometimes spiritual, sometimes social commentary, but always fast-paced and engaging. Read it in 2 days - excellent hard-bound copy from the seller. Thanks."
1,received knock-off version of boot,"I was disappointed to receive the ""knock-off"" (imitation) version of this product, which can be purchased at a much lower price. Amazon offered to replace the item, which we readily accepted. However, we once again recieved the cheaper version, not the Western Chief Boot."
4,Worth the money for the variety...,"These particular recordings will not likely make anyone's list of 'greatest ever' for the pieces in question, and it is a little annoying that some recordings are duplicated on two different discs in the set. That being said, it's a 10-disc set for not a lot of cash that provides a wide range of classical pieces by a wide variety of composers. If you're looking to try out some new/lesser-known composers but also score some of the greats in the same collection, this box set is worth it. Keep in mind it is all 'relaxing' classical music of 'meditation' - no drama to be found here - but it's great stuff to have on for taking an afternoon siesta, or reading, or even background when friends come to dinner. And if you just want a good collection of classical music to chill out to, it's definately worth the pennies."
4,A book you can read OVER and OVER,"My preschooler adores this book, both the rhymes and illustrations. I enjoy it because it belongs in that rare class of children's books that parents can read REPEATEDLY without gritting their teeth from the pain of repetition. And as any parent knows, that's what will happen when your child falls in love with a book. I really wish I could find prints to decorate my child's walls with the fantastic illustrations also - simple and eye catching in lots of bright colors."
5,Wondeful fun!,"I read this to my 20 month old almost every night. He loves the fabulous illustrations and the silly rhymes, and of course we add all the animal noises. My nieces and nephews are similarly enthralled when they come to visit; after one such visit, my sister-in-law suggested we get this book for my nephew's upcoming birthday, so here I am ordering another copy! Commotion in the Ocean is delightful in the same way."
2,"Not at all like ""Giraffes Can't Dance""","This book is not in the same league as ""Giraffes Can't Dance"". There really is no story;it's a bunch of descriptions of animals. The rhyming was off and the book constantly switches from first person to third person which I found annoying. I was highly disappointed."
5,great for kids,Rumble In the Jungle contains enough colorful illustrations and animal varieties to satisfy your children's learning techniques. Children are eager to learn when the pages are lit up brightly with beautiful images and this book does not disappoint in that regard. I highly recommend Rumble In the Jungle for all children.
4,"Spirit Archives, Volume 5","This book covers The Spirit Sunday comic strip from July, 1942 to December, 1942. Spirit creator Will Eisner had been inducted into the Army in May of 1942, so he didn't draw any of the comics here. He managed to contribute a few scripts, but not too many. Scripts were written by Manly Wade Wellman, Alfred Bester, William Woolfolk and possibly others. Most of the artwork was handled by Lou Fine, who was no Will Eisner, but was a great artist in his own right. While this is not the best of The Spirit, it was still one of the best ""masked crimefighter"" comics of the time period."
3,Its kind of helpful,Well this book gives out the basic values of almost every comic collectible ever made. I would reccomend it but rigght now you should probably get something better.
2,Problem Child,"If you want to know about Bessie Smith's life, check out the Chris Albertson book. If you want a thumb-nail sketch of her life, check any descent Blues Enclyclopedia (even Encarta isn't half bad.) If you want a fictional account of a blues legend, try August Wilson's ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom."" Trouble is, Kay tries to accomplish all three in the space of less than 200 pages. Smith's life was bigger than fiction, and FUN to read about. At best, this book will whet the appetite. But read it fast and move on..."
3,A solid Bessie Smith primer but a lot of old news,"For the person looking to just scratch the surface in understanding the Empress of the Blues, ""Bessie Smith (Outlines)"" hits the mark, giving the highlights and lowlights of her life and career. Perhaps, ""Outline"", the name of this book series, is an appropriate name given the length and depth of the book. For the Bessie diehards or those that want real depth, the book doesn't offer anything new or particularly insightful. Read the Chris Albertson book if you want the best bio on Bessie. Also, Kay annoyingly interjects fictional passages into the story, making it difficult to determine fact from fiction. I found that aspect irratating, particularly in a book so short. The back cover presents the Outline series as exploring the impact homosexual life has had on certain aritsts. Kay misses this point entirely. She actually avoids Smith's alleged homosexuality. It is a short (150 small size pages, large font) and easy read though."
4,Good starting point,"This book by Vera Stanley Alder is a very good introduction to the western esoteric traditions.It was written in the 1930's and reflects a lot of the thinking in occult /esoteric circles of that time.The author comes from a theosophical background so readers who are already aquaintaned with this line of thinking might find themselves on familiar ground.She ranks definetly amongst the best of the theosophical writers and has a clear and precise way of introducing the assorted subjects in this books.None of the arrogance of some of her fellow authors of these days that tried to sign you up for their group.Very valuable as a starting point to the occult teachings.Although some of the ideas / information may seem a bit outdated it is still better than most modern day books out there.She definetly knows what she is talking about.Also check out ""Shamballah"" by Victoria Page and a book by the same title written by Jan v. Rijkenborgh the dutch modern day Rosecrucian."
2,Unconvincing,"I read all the reviews on this book, and was really looking forward to reading it. With all due respect to the author, the book is hardly referenced, speculative, and relies on highly circumstantial evidence in support of its thesis: namely, that Lincoln was the victim of a Confederate plot. Also, the writing style is dull and unimaginative, hardly provoking much desire to turn the next page."
2,"Great band, great album, terrible rip",Don't bother with the mp3 version. 192k at a low quality.Why Amazon does this with classics is baffling. 256k CBR should be the minimum.
4,Progressive even for the '60s,"I've been listening to '60s music for over 25 years, and this is one of the few albums of that time that really fits the description of 'strange, but groovy'. I've been an Elevators fan for almost as long, and for me this one really kicks. It was the perfect release for '68. The first two tracks alone are worth the acquisition. I love all three albums and 'Bull of the Woods' is a good closer to the trilogy. If you're going to get the first two (highly recommended also), then complete the set with this one. Pure Texas psychedelia ala the 13th Floor!!!"
1,Waste of money,"Dont waste your money. I bought a set for each of my kids, and they didn't work well. The paper that came with the pens, was thin and cheap. We followed the directions, and twisted, and it either didn't work, or blended for a split second, and then back to original color. Total Waste of Money. They are now in the trash"
3,Disappointed Mimi,"I bought this for my grandchildren. The love to color, draw, paint, etc. They didnt seem to like this very much. When I offered to let them take them home they decided to just let MiMi keep them."
2,Just blended into a brown mess...,"All the tips on these have become one with the colors that were blended on them. Not a good idea, don't waste your money!"
1,Not good,"Bought for my daughter and she disliked them. Used them once, then never again. Bad quality and not worth the money spent. Would not recommend purchasing these pens."
1,"Fun, but they break very quickly","My 7 and 4 year old loved these pens, but the twisting/cap holder broke on every single one of them in a day (and the kids are not particularly rough).I would love to get more because the kids really want them, but they are so expensive, especially considering the quality. Too bad."
1,Overpriced markers,I bought these for my 5 yr old who loves drawing. I can't believe I paid $10 for 4 markers. She was never able to blend the colors properly. The darker color always over-powered the lighter color. These markers are nothing special and certainly not worth the money!
3,"Great picture, but not great quality","Can't complain about the logo - it's the best in college sports. But the pad is basically a simple piece of plastic. I was expecting a thicker product. The product description may indicate how thin it is, but just in case, now you know!"
4,Satisfied.,"The mousepad serves its purpose. The art print on it is nice. If the surface it sits on isn't perfectly clean, it moves around, but that isn't a hard thing to overcome. For the price, you can't beat it. I mean, its just a mousepad."
2,All The Way Rance Allen Group,Not my kind of gospel music. Too much R&B turn into gospel. Did not hold my intrest. Would not recommend to anyone.
3,Old Fashioned Doilies,"This is a nice collection of those old fashioned doilies which featured flowers. There are some filet pieces, some motifs, and some which merely feature flower designs - one color or in several colors."
1,No references to Scripture,All references and resources are to nonchristian or non scriptural sources. I keep expecting Willow Creek to throw a Godapaloozafest.
2,Dubious historical value,"Not being familiar with this aspect of the Battle of the Bulge, thought it would be worth the read; book is kind of short, though, and like many World War Two books that I've come across, doesn't appear to be all that well researched. I like detail, extensive research and referencing in order to trust a work of history; this book doesn't have it."
5,Perfect for little ones!,"We use this in our Kindergarten to teach about the way holidays are celebrated by other cultures. This is perfect- culturally sensitive, easy to understand, beautifully illustrated. Just like you expect Tomie dePaola books to be."
4,Wonderful holiday book!,"Tomie dePaola is our favorite children's author and having him tell stories of Christmastime traditions is wonderful. Well done, as always!"
2,Pictures not appropriate,I was very excited about this story until i saw the pictures of children dressed as the devil.I was not able to use this in my classroom.I do not think this story is appropriate for young students in public schools.
4,ok,This goes with my Christmas Around the World study. My first graders were a little confused by it as it has a magical element to it.
3,Better for older students,"I thought this would be helpful for teaching second graders about Las Posadas. The language was a too high for them. I don't plan on using this book next year. Overall, the book has a beautiful story and illustrations, but I will save it for my own kids, not my students."
1,Not universal,"The Book cover blurb doesn't tell the buyer that the auther is an Episcopalian Priestess. If the reader is a liberal Episcopalian, the reader will probably love the book. However, Heart Wisperers isn't for everyone and might be a disapointment or even offensive for some readers.The book is fairly well written, but not for the general audience of Benedictines. Roman Catholic Oblates would find there are many pages with theological and moral unsoundess.Frankly, what is disapointing, is it wouldn't have taken that much effort to strip out the snipe at the Fundimentalists and tone down the social re-engineering comments. Perhaps in the future Canham will write books that have a broader appeal."
4,Excellent resource,"A very insightful and scripturally sound commentary. I would highly recommend this book to anyone serious about bible study. The sermon on the mount is the Lord's sermon, so obviously the best one ever; and this commentary does the best analysis of that sermon that I have ever read."
1,Only 1 left in stock--order soon. Not really,"Only 1 left in stock--order soon. Not true. I thought I got the ""Only 1 left in stock""! Soccer. Not a good deal. Not a deal at all. Amazon did not publish my ""real review""!"
2,Sound quality a major distraction,"The double LP of Mingus at Monterey was one of my prize possessions in the late 60's. It had a great sound, as I remember. This version of Meditations is a masterpiece. However, in the transfer to CD, the sound of the horns especially the flute in the higher registers, is all distorted, and whoever engineered it must have had cloth ears. Too much top-end, transfer levels too high, it's a travesty. Everytime I play the CD, I tell myself that I will ignore the poor quality this time, but it's always difficult. Such wonderful music is marred by someone's insensitivity."
1,Horrible production,"DO NOT BUY THIS IMPORT CD! Mingus' great Monterey concert has been butchered by a CD so poor as to be unlistenable. My copy, bought new by the way, has surface noise and distortion that completely ruins the lisening experience. I can only wonder why this album has never been reissued on CD in the U.S."
4,An insightful and positive view for a change!,"This book provides an entertaining and informative look inside the world of international adoption. Written in journal format, it gives the reader insight which could only be obtained through a personal memoir. There are moments of great hilarity as well as great sadness. But the story has a happy ending, and gives a positive view overall of the adoption process. With so much negative press about adoption in general, this was a breath of fresh air!"
1,"Same exact set as ""Saturday Morning Cartoons 1970s vol. 1""","This is the same exact set as ""Saturday Morning Cartoons 1970s vol. 1"" with a new, inferior cover. If you own the set from 2009, you don't need this one."
1,The 8-Ball Handbook for Winners,"I was expecting a book and got a little pamphlet. Nothing was very informative, inspiring, or valued with this purchase. I felt that I wasted some money on it."
3,Mediocre film,"As a long-time admirer of British film, I continue to think this stagy melodrama far from the high standards normally associated with a Guinness film. The two-fold problem is a weak, corny, and predictable script and some major overacting by people who seem to think they in a theater rather than on film."
5,Fantastic Don Williams original hits!,"If you want to hear the mellow voice of Don Williams, then this a CD for you. All of his biggest hits are on it, and they are the originals !"
5,King Don Rules!,"This CD is one of those that you can put in and not have to fast forward through endless songs to get to the good ones. Every single solitary song on this CD is GREAT! My favorite is ""Good Ole Boys Like Me."" Don himself calls this song a ""mini-novel."" I'm an English teacher, and I agree with Don. However, I would have called it a novella! :0 Happy Listening!"
5,Fills the Soul,"This collection has all the best of Don Williams. It is like meeting an old friend again as soon as the music starts and his full, baritone voice comes thru, so rich and heartwarming. There are no singers today coming close to matching his voice. The title of ""Gentle Giant"" is well earned."
5,Easy Listening,"This was a great CD if you like easy listening country & western music. Other than one song, I loved the entire collection. Great CD!"
5,Waltzing Music to dance to.,"Famous for his great love songs, soft smooth voice, this CD is pure Don Williams.Jodi S."
3,Don Williams CD,Definitive collection of Don Williams songs is a good music CD. Don is a good singer but I wasn't too happy with all of his songs.But that is my taste. Overall this CD is good.
5,Don Williams Best Ever On This Album,"Don Williams Could Not have Been Better Then He Is On This Album,What A Great Artist To Listen To.He Is One That Sings From The Heart ,& The Tempo Of His songs Is Great."
2,Spend more money and get a BETTER model,This model gets a lot of hits on things that aren't police cars. I have used it on the highway only. I had to move it below the tinted strip on my windshield because it won't receive through window tint. Oh well - too bad since all you get in the package is a flimsy sunction-mounted bracket that won't hold up the unit whilst going over the slighest of bumps in your car.
1,sucks big time!,don't buy....I bought for 34 bucks on buy.com and it is not worth a penny!! I have seen several cops on the street and this thing rarely beeps with a cop around....although it is sure to beep when I apprach a toll plaza!! what good is that? what a waste of my money....don't know what the other reviewers who gave this 4-5 stars are smoking!
3,Performs okay,"The product performed pretty much as advertised. The display panel is impossible to read in the daytime - however, the different tones for different types of signals tell you what it is detecting. I wish it could detect stationary photo cameras but it doesn't. I don't know if any radar detector would do so."
2,disappointed,"Within a week or 10 days the detector quit working, and I don't know how or where to send it for replacement. Can you tell me? Thanks."
1,The most annoying radar detector ever,"My current radar detector has worked for 10 years. It is a Cobra. So I decided to replace it when the voice alert started to sound like the speaker is dieing. This was a mistake. The unit makes a loud sound that sounds like an hour of space invaders sped up to play in 2 seconds when you start the engine. It goes back to city mode when you start up. The volume resets when you start up. In short, this is an ANNOYING radar detector. I also noted that it wasn't picking up police officers when used side by side with my old one, and it got many more false alerts. So I returned it. Do your ears a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT!!"
3,Broke after 2 years,"I bought this in 2008 and had it for 2 years. I only use when I'm on long road trips and it worked fine. I believe it saved me a few tickets as I slowed down when it pinged only to see a CHP fly by me a minute later. Unfortunately, this detector no longer works. I'm researching new detectors and I'm seeing that more bands exist so this unit may be limited and not up to snuff with current law enforcement technology."
4,An Average Driver Gadget,"At first I was a little leary about buying this radar detector, its the same one I see at all the local electronics stores, and its always the cheapest. So instinct would tell you that you get what you paid for. While this radar detector may seem cheap at first glance (the packaging), it actually will suprise you. It can detect police radar as well as safety vehicles (although I have never heard it go off for those...). The speed of the unit is great, it seems to detect the radar as quick as some more expensive ones, but as we cannot see the police officer at the exact moment, noone will ever know. All in all, a great purchase for the average driver who is worried about getting any tickets."
4,Great Product....,I have been using this radar detector for quite some time now...and i just bought another one for someone else. This detector has saved me from tickets and has also warned me in case of an emergency vehicle. I recommend this product to everyone.
3,"Decent detector, crappy accessories","Its not perfect, but what do you expect for $40 ? The car accessories are cheap and worthless. The stick-on Velcro piece does not stick to my dashboard, so I had to use the suction piece on the window, which does not suction very well either.I did notice that it always detects traffic cameras, so thats a plusIt picks up cops maybe 50% of the time.I would invest more money on a better detector."
1,Cobra detectors suck,"Do not purchase a Cobra radar detector...their product does work at first with warnings as they promise. But, after only a few week, the detector does NOT even detect automatic door openers at Walmart and other radar ""detecting"" objects. Simply put, this product did not work for me and very disappointed...radar detectors are made to detect - arent they?"
4,Penthouse,"When I put this on the cage the hamster started using it as his Penthouse!Put some bedding in and he loved it. He likes being able to look out at the cats and dogs and wiggle his whiskers at them knowing he is safe from them. Like the fact that the top ""locks"" down (there is a small ridge to push it past) so other animals can't remove the top."
4,Hamster Haven,"This is a fantastic add-on for my hamster cage. Aside from a wet tail scare because I didn't realize that I should put some bedding up there for her, she loves it. It's a little hard to clean sometimes, but clicks onto the cage well. Also, keep an eye on the top cuz it does unscrew easily and you wouldn't want your little one escaping!"
1,Lid opens too easily,"This looked great at first, but the lid kept popping open on it's own.I would hear a loud crashing sound and the lid would be open. I really don't know if my hamster learned to twist the lid open since the lid is very easily twisted to open.I only had this for 2 days and I regret buying it.The lid flew open again in the middle of the night which lead to my hamster's tragic death. My dog found the hamster before I did!!!!"
2,Not good for larger hamsters!,"This product is good quality and fits in the Crittertrail cages very well. However! My hamster is a boy and a bit on the larger side and NEVER went up in the lookout tower. There's not much area in the little dome for them to sleep. Perhaps if I had a smaller hamster, he would have enjoyed it."
4,Great while it lasted but it does not last long with a gerbil!,"I have had this for a year and it worked great as a sleeping place for my gerbil until now. For some crazy reason, my gerbil decided to nibble a hole overnight through the bottom of it and escape! I found him many hours later (I had not even realized he was gone at first because the hole was hidden)- he was having a great time running around my son's bedroom. I thought about replacing it but will probably try the critter trail burrow instead as it will give him more space. Though I am sure with time he'll chew through that too. Unfortunately, the plastic just is not strong enough for gerbils teeth- eventually they eat through anything made of plastic- I already have replaced numerous critter fun tubes.By the way, don't be put off by other reviews about how the lid comes open- it does not if you close it right. Turn it all the way, then turn it back a fraction then it will sit just right!"
3,Not for Syrian Hamsters.,"The lookout is a cute addition for you hamster to have fun in. However, I am disappointed that my Crittertrail habitat and lookout expansion are too small for a Syrian hamster. All these tubes need to made wider or the packaging should say they are made for dwarf hamsters. I was scared to wake up and find my hamster stuck in his tube and he isn't even full grown yet.In Short, if you have a dwarf hamster or one around 4-5 inches it is fine but 6-7 inch Syrians have trouble using narrow tubes."
5,Hamster loves it,"Our hamster love this thing, I on the other hand hate it, our hamster is alway in it, takes his food up there his bedding up there and he pee's in it all the time. It has little holes in it for him to breathe but it also means all the other stuff falls out the holes. it is easy to open and clean but wow really he is a pig lol"
3,Well made but missing an important function,"This is a well made add on that installs easily and fits well however it is missing something to attach it to the cage. The result is a piece that swivels easily and has no way to support itself. You will find that it will not function without some sort of additional support to keep it from falling over, off of the cage."
2,not so great,"I bought this to add to a basic Crittertrail cage and the only place to attach it is the sides of the cage. Well, it's top heavy and swings over. Plus my dwarf hamster was too scared to go down the long section of tubing once she got up to the lookout on top. I was able to take out one section and then it became a little more stable plus Mochi could climb down. However, there is no room in the lookout for bedding and my hammie just huddles up there and stays when I attach it. Not sure if she's happy up there or not, so most of the time, it's detached. I think if the little room had and entrance and exit and tubes that went over top or side of cage,this would be a better addition."
1,I didnt like it,"I bought this lookout on tuesday hoping to connect it to my hamster cage. When I got it, I tried to attach it from the top. First, it wouldnt slide into the whole from the top so i had to open the whole top on the cage and put it in like that. Second, the lookout wouldnt stand up! the hole was bigger then the lookout so the lookout would slide everywhere. I hated this fun-nel! Its very annoying! I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone because I ended up returning it and its really a bother."
3,Not bad... but not great,"My hamster loves it and will eat in it and sleep in it. But when she poops in it, it is really hard to clean"
4,Robin To The Hamster Cave,"Well My Winter White Dwarf Hammie ""Richard Dick Grayson"" AKA Grayson loves his ""Lazy Lookout"". He always leave food in it. He goes to the top and stays there for long periods of time. Great Product"
5,Perfect add on,I had a look out tower that clipped shut but my Houdini teddybear hamster kept biting the latch from the inside and getting loose in the middle of the night...I bought this one to replace it and it works perfect....he fits in it kinda okay since he is a fatty hamster :) it is not the same size as the purple one that came with the critter trail with the turn-about wheel on top (purple and pink one)...the thing I like most about it is that it twist and latches shut so there is nothing for him to bite and open it up. It would fit best for dwarf hamsters but my teddybear hamster likes it
5,Still a classic album!,"U2's The Joshua Tree is at times, peaceful, moving, emotional, deep and rocking all at the same time. Some of the social themes are still felt today in U2's later albums such as All That You Can't Leave Behind from 2000. With or Without You, I Still Haven't Found, and Where The Streets Have No Name are still favorites. But other songs like Mothers of the Disappeared and One Tree Hill are very well done too. It is such a dynamic, creative and high point for the band and Bono and his band still perform songs from it in concerts."
5,U2 the tree,"The best band ever to play rock and roll.And if rock & roll is the devil, they are the best sounding devils i ever herd .This is the best recorded album in the world .buy it and you will love it!"
3,Remastered?,"Just purchased the so called ""remastered: version. The cd sound quaility is extreemly week...hollow and empty with no impact. No comment on the dvd. I have a high end system and am sick and tired of these so called remastered cd's. They are all a complete rip off! Save your $$$ and listen to the origionals......"
5,Definitely a Desert Island Disc,One of the best albums (in my opinion) of all time. This album encapsulates U2's heart & soul from their earliest music.
5,U2 at their finest,"U2 reached their peak in 1987 with The Joshua Tree. The album is a masterpiece for many reasons. More then just the songs, it's the way the songs blend together into a true album, the way most 5 star albums do. The opening track, ""Where the Streets Have no Name"", sums up the album in one song. Layered keyboards, mysterious guitars, deep vocals, songs that make you think. Also, this is just another example of a timeless classic, it sounds like nothing else from 1987 and nothing else like anything from anytime. In twenty years I will play this for my children and they wont know that it's 30 years old. That, to me, is the definition of music at it's best. BUY IT!"
4,Really Good Album,"To begin with, I am not a u2 fan, but this album, when it came into my hands for no apparent reason, was some thing incedible. I never thought I'd like it, but it turned out to be a great album. it's consistant, nice, pleasant, everything good. This album is something really special and any music fan should have it. In my opinion, it's u2's best work."
1,The Joshua Tree by U2 from Amazon - Medimops Company,Purchased from 'Medimops'/ Amazon company. It apperars this is a poor counterfeit copy of the classic U2 disc that I was expecting to purchase - graphics and disc do not match any reference material I have seen for this CD. Buyer beware
3,Terrible packaging (missing CD),"I'll let you read the other reviews for the details on the set. This is a warning for those who buy the deluxe box set.I can't comment on the quality of the new mix of the CD because it wasn't in the deluxe packaging box it shipped in. Yup, you read that right. When you buy the ""Joshua Tree Deluxe 2CD/1DVD set"" it may not contain the actual CD that spurred the whole set in the first place. I'm sure Amazon will replace it with no hassle, but it may be a PITA if you buy it for someone as a Christmas gift.The DVD, B Sides, and new mix make this whole thing worth it for those that already have the original CD.Merry Christmas everybody (and happy Hanukkah to our Jewish friends)."
3,The Joshua Tree (1987),"U2's The Joshua Tree was a huge smash in 1987 when it was released. I'll gladly admit that I am not a huge fan of U2, but the Joshua Tree is a pretty decent cd. The best songs, in my opinion are Where the Streets Have No Name, With or Without You, and I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For. The cd as a whole is pleasant and listenable, but the above metioned three songs are the only one that really leave an impression with me after the cd is done."
5,From Absolute Best to Decent,"1. THE JOSHUA TREE *****2. ACHTUNG BABY *****3. WAR ****1/24. ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND *****5. BOY ****6. HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB *****7. THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE ****1/28. ZOOROPA ****9. RATTLE AND HUM ****10. POP ****11. OCTOBER ***1/2**If one really thinks about it, this band really hasn't made a disastrous album!"
5,The Joshua Tree,"The first three songs are probably the best U2 songs ever. ""With or Without You"" reminds me of the bitter irony of the breakup of relationships. You can't get better lyrics in any other U2 album. This album is good if you want melodic, coherent songs, don't bother if you're looking for blinding guitar riffs or drum solos. I could almost call this album ""haunting"", which it is."
2,it is not worth it!,"The bonus DVD (Paris concert) is the only appreciable thing of this bundle, not their best performance (Streets is missing!) but it is much better than what filmed in Rattle & Hum.""Outside it's America"" is just complete and utter rubbish, really pathetic patchwork.Audio CDs are remastered but audio quality is as poor as in the original album."
2,What's so great??,"The first four songs alone would be worth 5stars. It's the other 5 and 6 that weigh it down. Being a music lover who isn't over the age of 40, there's not enough..mmphh on the album. You're better of getting How To Dismantle A Bomb, Achtung Baby or No Line On The Horizon."
1,I'm Not A 13 Year Old Kid,"I despise Johua Tree. I don't know why, maybe it's because it's the CD they sold out on. Every time I hear a song from the God awful CD on the radio it's like hearing someone run their nails down a chalk board.Needless to say I change the station fast.If you really like U2 listen to their earlier CD's like Boy, War, or The Unforgettable Fire. All That You Can't Leave Behind is pretty good. But if you want a really good U2 CD check out Achtung Baby. It's their best CD in years!"
1,my thoughts on U2,"Believe you me, I know music so I don't want to get a lot of angry ""you're an idiot"" responses. I don't get it. When I say ""it,"" I mean this fascination with U2. I've listened to the Joshua Tree since I was just a kid and even as a child I could tell the band was terrible. The Edge is an overrated guitarist and Bono's sappy lyrics and complaining voice are nore than I can handle. U2=most overrated band in history. I hear they are good live performers but I don't care because the music is ludicrous. Pick up something from the Velvet Underground, early Bowie, or the Band if you want some truly compelling rock music."
5,One of the best albums of all time,"Okay...so there's ""Where the Streets..."", ""I Still Haven't Found..."", ""With or Without You"", and ""Mothers of the Disappeared"" and the first three classics are presented back-to-back-, no wonder one reader said that it was a work of pure beauty in an era of pure sh**...this was out in 1987 amidst all the cheesy tunes of the 80s...a true timeless classic from a band that was regarded by many as probably the best band in history"
5,a gift of Americana from Bono and company,"In November 1987, my roommate and I made our way from the Rocky Mountains to the San Francisco Bay Area and, more specifically, the Oakland Colliseum to see U2, The Pretenders, and the BoDeans. It was an incredible weekend. Bono spray painted on the fountain at Embarcadero, and the Bay Bridge traffic came to a stop at lunch as people jammed the roads trying to get there. A friend slept in line and so we were at the front wall throughout the concert. It was one of those rare occasions where they let you in with cameras, too, so I have some great shots. W also got to play Uno with Bill Graham who was riding around on his golf cart, and hung out for a bit.This is one of the most memorable albums of all time. Huge singles, and a beauty and richness around the theme of America that ingrained U2 as a household name, and made this album a part of all of us. This is about as close to a perfect album as you can get."
5,Wow,"This is truly the best album ever written. You may be hooked in originally by Where the Streets Have No Name, or With or Without you. But you will soon discover gems such as Mothers of the Disappeared and One Tree Hill. Rolling Stone recently named it the 26th greatest album of all time, and though U2 has come out with many more, they will never be able to outdo the brilliantness of the Joshua Tree."
5,U2 Jushua Tree Remastered Box Set,"Excellent box set! The Paris concert DVD is a great look at the band when they were comming into their own. The bonus audio CD with the B sides is great. And of course, the remastered album is wonderful. I think this is a must have for any U2 fan !!!"
5,A U2 Must have!,"This is a beautifully packaged CD. I bought it to replace may original copy of The Joshua Tree, but it is so nice that I will put it aside as a keepsake, and buy another copy to use. I love that it is remastered and the sound is cleaner.The book is really nice with photos by Anton Corbjin who has photographed the band from the beginning. You will find his photos in the books U2byU2, and U2 and I. There are also some photo cards that are a nice addition to the set.The bonus DVD is something that you would not get elsewhere, and the concert is one of the best ever. As a longtime fan of U2 this is an exciting addition to my collection of collectables and the band has once again given us more of them to appreciate!"
1,CD,"Ordered U2's Joshua Tree from these clowns over a month ago never got the CD just some lame excuse. Frankly, stay away from them they blow."
2,You too???,"Look at all the flags and all the banners waving. They will open up their arms and you can come on in, a magic kingdom waits for you! This is average stuff really.For a real piece of 'Celtica' go up to search and type in, DONT STAND ME DOWN. I can understand why you might like this but really to me its no diffrent from say Simple Minds. An average record from an average band. The people who say that they sold out however are wrong."
2,Over rated to say the least,"""The Joshua Tree"" starts off good with its best three songs in a row, and the excellent ""I still haven't found what I'm looking for"" is of course the albums highlight. After this great introduction things go downhill and at the end of the album I'm pretty bored. I think (like at least some others) that this album is over rated - it's far from THAT good. But if people actually believe that albums like Jay Farrer's ""Sebastopol"", Beth Orton's ""Daybreaker"", and Coldplay's ""A rush of blood to the head"" is worth 5 stars I guess the same goes for this one.Take my word, a ""best of"" U2 will be enough."
2,The first 3 songs are classic....then...,"The album falters...Occupied by ""Running to stand still"" and other rubbish garbage. Buy this album but expect to hit your SKIP button after the first 3 tracks."
1,SELL OUT,"All this album does is mark the beginning of U2's commercial era and puts them into the ""sell out"" category. I'm so glad The Smiths/Depeche Mode/even The Police didn't follow the same path."
2,Audiophiles Need Not Apply,"The compression/over-processing scourge has struck once more! This new remaster is intended for the mp3 crowd. If you fall into that category - you'll like it just fine. If you're an audiophile looking to upgrade your old copy - forget it. The old version is better. The record companies are selling fewer CD's, and they're alienating the few good customers they have left. I buy hundreds of CD's every year, but that will change if I keep getting screwed. Are you listening record companies? Sell your compressed/over-processed audio to the ipod crowd through downloads. If you want to keep selling CD's, you'd better get your act together."
5,WOW!!!,"This is one of the greatest gifts I ever gave my husband! He lit up like a Christmas tree when he dove into the box. Pictures, a book, 2 cds, a dvd...and so much more. WOW!!"
5,The Joshua Tree experience,"Finally after two years waiting, I have this work on my hands. I found it greater than I though. Listen the b-sides CD once and again, and again, give me the old taste of U2, full of energy and desires."
5,AWESOME!!!!,The Best U2 album now with all this extras and an amazing packaging...only for collectors and REAL fans!!!
3,pretty good,I am a huge U2 fan and found this to be an informative dvd for someone who wants to learn about them. Some parts are kind of slow.
5,classic. one of their best albums ever,"This album is one of the few albums ever to recieve my ""play"" level of approval. See most artists put a few good radio friendly tracks on an album, then fill the rest up with the left overs. Even U2 is guilty of this, See lemon or zoo tv albums.Josuha Tree however is one of the few albums that I can place into my cd player and never worry about skipping a bad song.There are no bad songs on this album they all rock."
5,a landscape of the eighties for gen-xers,U2 laid a landscape of the eighties for gen-xers of how music could and should sound like. It is an artifact of pop rock before popular music became an object of today's all too familiar ploy of record companies creating marketing schemes to produce stars without substance. This CD was the international phenomenon that is the pinacle of U2's recording career.
5,song of the decade,"This CD includes the greatest song ever produced - where the streets have no name. If you do not have this CD, then you do not have in your collection, the greatest song ever made! MAD"
5,The Joshua Tree,The product arrived on schedule and very well packed! The transaction went smoothly without any problem.The site is easy to use and has very good products.
4,A great one from U2,"This album went platinum in 48 hours when it was released in 1987, making it the fastest-selling UK album ever. It reached number 1 in twenty-two countries selling 15 million worldwide. U2 also received the Grammy for 'Album Of The Year' for it.This kind of success is quite understandable with songs like Where The Streets Have No Name and I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For. It also includes the incredible With Or Without You, with its haunting melodies and thoughtful lyrics. The whole album flows together as Bono and the boys take the listener on a musical roller coaster."
5,A Timeless Masterpiece,"This is the finest album ever created, bar none. Anyone that has the audacity to tell you that this isn't one of the classic albums of all time is an egotistical know-it-all who thinks that insulting it somehow makes their opinions more important. Music doesn't get any better than this."
1,"U2's Lamest, Most Mediocre Album. Period.","This is the album where U2 sold out. This is the album where U2 fans went from being cool people to being a mess of jocks and party girls. Bullet the Blue Sky is the only good song on it. Think I'm exagerating? How many times can you listen to ""With Or Without You"" before you realize you'd rather be poking your eyes out slowly with a fork?"
1,no thanks,"""greatest album of all-time."" ""most soulful band of all time."" blah blah blah. all i can say in response to the idiotic hype around this band is a simple:no. they WISH they could have been the clash. Bono's a joke. sure, they HAD a message, what happened to it now? lost it on the way to the bank i suppose."
1,U2 is pretty boring,"I agree with ""A Kids Review"" on the latest review on How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. They are pretty boring. And this music makes you fall asleep. All the songs are bad!! Read that review and agree!!PS THE KID WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH!!"
1,Satan is alive and well,"Just the fact that this mess of a CD exists and people bought it shows the power Satan(or whatever name for evil you prefer) is running rampant in the world. I once wrote a song called ""Dave Evans Must Die"" because the music here is so boring."
1,I can't believe ANYBODY likes this album,"This album is god-awful. Bono is a whiny self-aggrandizing jerk and the Edge can't play a guitar to save his life. Of course, I could have written this review about any U2 album cause they are all of about the same caliber."
3,"Sorry, I DON'T GET IT, either!","I give it a three, because I like the way ""With or Without You"" builds, which reminds me a teeny bit of ""The Unforgettable Fire,"" but misses that mark--that song is like a symphony, this is just a single movement. I listened from the beginning--Gloria, I Will Follow (off Boy and October, which were kind of uneven albums, IMHO), but I liked War (New Year's Day is really good), and I loved The Unforgettable Fire, mostly for that track, but the rest is good listening as well. This album was just SO hyped, and like many have said, ""Where The Streets.."" and ""And I Still..."" are just too over-the-top, and they sound alike. (I love what the Pet Shop Boys did to ""Where The Streets...,"" to which Bono cunningly(?) borrows a PSB song to ask them, ""What Have We Done To Deserve This?"" :-) Too big for your britches, and it gets worse, I fear. I think I'll like them again with Achtung Baby and POP!"
3,Too much hype,"This album has some amazng songs on it. Don't get me wrong. But once you get past the first 3, it kind of goes downhill from there. These guys are great musicians, but this album doesn't stick to one particlar style...it kind of goes everywhere. Maybe worth downloading some of the songs, but not purchasing the whole album."
5,A Must Have,"This is A must have for any U2 Fan, 20 years later it still is the #1 Album of all time to me and the bonus cd and Dvd as well as a book and some real nice black & white photos TWO THUMBS UP"
4,A must for U2 collecters,"The Joshua Tree Super Deluxe Edition is a powerfull package of 1 CD with remastered Joshua Tree, 1 CD with old b-sides and unreleased song and 1 DVD with Live concert. The Joshua Tree is as expecter, its great as for 20 years ago. The CD with b-sides and unreleased is not great song, but fun to hear. The DVD is a must with the concert from back then. It has a beautiful book which is much like a bible - nice nice. Filled with goodies. Also you find some very nice pictures on carbon. It is all nicely packed in a hardbox that in itself is art.All in all - a very beautiful U2 art and culture."
5,An all-time favorite,"I bought this CD because I wore out my first copy of it. All in all, probably the best album U2 ever made in terms of song after song after song outstanding quality, musicality and writing. Maybe I should stockpile copies for when this one wears out. Or maybe just wait for more changes in technology and have the songs on every possible medium."
5,Gran edición,Además de tener grandes clásicos esta grabación presenta canciones que quedaron guardadas en los archivos. Es la mejor oportunidad para escuchar temas poco conocidos del grupo.
5,The view from the top,"Here is a beautiful object lesson for today's ""angry youth"": you don't have to girate to a repetitive, mindless beat while shouting pointless, profanity-laden tirades to express yourself. Marvel at how these guys do it. Subtle, eerie, thoughtful, powerful. You feel that these guys are searchers, not always happy with the state of things, but not resorting to jeuvenile antics to express themselves. They're political without naming names. Great stuff that needs to be in your collection."
4,Best U2 album of the 80's,"It's a great album, but the sound is very influneced by american music. I'd like more their european influenced albums like Atchung Baby. Anyway, is a great record."
4,"i love to replay, replay....","I love this album, i can pay the first five songs over and over again. If i am ever feeling down, i just play this tape and the beat and everything take me away."
4,"A little overrated, but still good.","Okay, so the excellent lyrics are still there. I mean good lyrics are a primary part of a good song. But still...it's only a ""part"" of the song. I listen to this album and think...""okay, so what did they do on this album that is musically different from their past albums?"" U2's style in the '80s was very distinct with Edge's echoing guitar and Bono's intelligent lyrics, but like I said, the lyrics will only take you so far. ""Bullet the Blue Sky"" is the best song on here, but it kinda reminds me of Led Zeppelin. The music is good, but I honestly don't see how it is any better than...""October"" or ""The Unforgettable Fire."" To me, it sounds the same. Don't get me wrong...I like this album, but I'd rather own ""Zooropa"" and ""Pop"" instead of this."
4,Their biggest,"This classic launched U2 into megastardom, and stands as the crossroads between their earlier gritty political material and subsequent fuzzed-up nineties work. This really is quite a good collection of spiritual, American-inspired songs, including perhaps the band's biggest hits. Some songs work better than others (""Bullet the Blue Sky"" loses appeal after many listens), and some are a bit too dark, but overall it works well."
5,The most complete rock album of them all!!,"U2 has to be divided in eras. The first era, Steve Lillywhite's era, Boy, October and War. The last era, Flood's era, Zooropa and Pop. And the best of them all, the Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois's era. The best U2 material came from the hand of these two virtuosos. The Unforgettable Fire, Achthung Baby and the masterpiece The Joshua Tree. There hasnt been an album that represent better than The Joshua Tree what the real U2 is. Bono's lyrics, The Edge's radical tones, Clayton's rythms and Mullen's beat make of this album the best of my generation. The Joshua Tree is complete from the beginning to the end. From the emotional Where the Streets Have No Name to the sad Mothers of the Disappeared. If you want to know what U2 wanted to be when they started, you most listen to this album."
5,The Joshua Tree,"This CD was the first I ever bought in 1988 (a year after the official release), and I still love it. It also marked my first exposure to U2, after all the hype that surrounded it around the time I boughtThe ""1st side"" of the album is full of U2 classics (Where The Streets Have No Name, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, With Or Without You, Bullet The Blue Sky, etc.).The second side is strong as well (One Tree Hill, In God's Country, Exit).One of their best!"
4,breath of fresh air,i was not a U2 fan until i heard this album. who told them to sing what i was feeling back then this album is too good to be true and to top it off they're white boys from ireland or scotland. kudos to U2
5,There aren't enough stars in the sky...,"It is a crime to compare any of U2's recordings to The Joshua Tree. I own all of them, and this is quite simply the light on the hill. As far as U2's recordings go, it is an acheivement unapproachable in its carry of texture and mood. From the opening track to the final note on the last, one feels invited to listen. It is a complete work in the truest sense. In short, enough simply cannot be said. 5 stars? There are not enough stars in the sky. A classic."
5,"LISTEN TO ME, AND LISTEN CLEARLY","ANYONE WHO CHARACTERIZES THIS ALBUM AS A ""SELL-OUT"" ALBUM HAS REALLY GO TO OPEN THEIR EYES. DO ME A FAVOR AND LISTEN TO MAIN-STREAM RADIO STATIONS TODAY MY FRIENDS. WHAT DO YOU HEAR? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU HEAR! RICKY MARTIN, HANSON, BACKSTREET BOYS, SMASH-MOUTH, SUGAR-RAY, ETC, ETC, ETC. THE JOSHUA TREE SHOULD BE PRAISED, AND NOT RIDICULED BY SOME PEOPLE, AS BEING A RARE CASE WHEN A COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL ALBUM ACTUALLY HOLDS MERIT. I MEAN, DID YOU LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM? THERE'S NOT A SONG, EVEN THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN PLAYED TO DEATH, THAT ISN'T ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL, BOTH LYRICALLY AND MUSICALLY. THIS ALBUM ACTUALLY INFLUENCED ME TO VISIT JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL PARK, CA. - AND I'M FROM NEW YORK! IT WAS THE MOST AMAZING EXPERIENCE TO TAKE IN THE MUSIC AND THE SCENERY AND CONNECT WITH IT ALL. AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I'M NOT EVEN A FREAK! I LOVE THIS ALBUM. IT IS THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME."
4,Black album of U2,"The beatles had their White album, Metallica had their black album and U2 had Joshua Tree. This was the album that transformed U2 into the mainstream from being an underground protest rock band into a large stadium rock band. They also released a movie Rattle and Hum a year after its release and showed footage of the recording sessions of this album which was pretty interesting. Overall This was the last great studio album they'll do after that they start following trends instead of leading them like their next album Achtung Baby has some good songs like one and a few others but it was too radio friendly and bland but after that album they released unlistenable albums like Zooropa and pop."
2,Remastered? Original sounds much better,"The original CD itself is a 5-star IMO and one of my top 10 favorite albums/CD. However, I have listened to the LP (bought in 1987) and original CD of this a many many times. When I put the remastered version from this box set I don't hear much improvement. The DVD concert in Paris in 1987 is AMAZING (That alone I would give a 5-star). I'm not crazy about the documentary and will probably never watch it again. The videos are okay. The B-sides are cool and interesting. The book and essays is 5-star. The additional photos are filler IMO. I would have preferred to buy the DVD separately and save about $20 bucks. The box set is a must for U2 fans. My suggestion for people not sure about U2, or not familiar with this era of U2, borrow the DVD from a friend. One of the best live shows I have ever seen."
3,"Good, but...","Yeah, yeah, a classic. I've read all the raves. But this is where U2 started to lose me. I loved their early work -- it all had a very mysterious, exotic quality to it. On the Joshua tree, they ditch that mood, and replace it with a more open, American feel. To me, they lost what was special about their sound. I've learned to appreciate it a little more since then, but it still doesn't hold the power for me that the best cuts on the Unforgettable Fire or War do. It's still a mystery to me why this album is the one that everybody singles out."
5,One of the best albums ever,"I think this is the best U2 album and one of my TOP 10 favorite albums of all times. I had two vinyls at the time (it came out before CDs) that I wore thin and one cassette that I used to travel with in my walkman (no ipods back then). I think this album epitomizes the very best of U2's creative genius. Nothing they have ever done comes close to this one accept maybe How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb... If you've never heard this album, once you listen, you'll never stop...it's simply timeless. Extremely recommended."
5,The Perfect Album,"It is a cliche, but words cannot do justice to this album. It is perfect. I could have it on infinite loop and never tire of it. The Joshua Tree simply is the greatest album ever produced. From the building crescendo of ""Where the Streets Have No Name""; to the deep spirituality of ""I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For""; to the desperate longings of ""With or Without You""; to the bold and charging indictments of ""Bullet the Blue Sky""; to the sad addictions of ""Running to Stand Still""; to the haunting conclusion of ""Mothers of the Disappeared""; every song rings with the absolute truth of a band who has discovered the perfect pitch of their ultimate voice. No serious U2 fan can go without this album. It is the best of one of the world's greatest bands."
1,The Loudness War continues...,"Once again, a classic album falls victim to the idiotic modern trend of maxing everything out in the mix to create a muddled, lifeless sound. All the atmosphere and nuance of the original album is lost in this remaster; Bullet the Blue Sky sounds especially awful. Stick with the original album."
1,Better sound?,"Really, does anyone noticed a real SOUND improvement over the early 90s edition of this cd?"
3,The Dublin messiah still hasn't found what he's looking for,"Where for two songs they're ready for the history books; where for two songs the Edge waxes universal; where for much of the lp, he masters the possibilities of dynamic delayed guitar--the jangly guitars and atmospheric production that surpass even The Feelies and The Woodentops. Hardly a movie couldn't (doesn't?) use the first two cuts as a soundtrack. Instead, for the next 4 songs you hear as the Mekons aptly characterized: ""the Dublin messiah just scattering crumbs."" Best to stand a distance from Bono. Maybe he's more prophetic now as owner of Forbes magazine? The added expertise of Eno/Lanois remains (if only they didn't hold back so on Larry Mullen jr.) But alas, no one can save Bono, and therefore, the further you get in, the more you hear the background music; or...the soundtrack."
5,A Great One Gets Even Better,"This is the one that made a U2 believer out of me and is still my favorite. Though it has never sounded dated to me, the remastering brings it new life. The Paris show DVD is a great bonus as well as all the material recorded for the project brought together in one place. I hope all their albums will be remastered with all these bells and whistles included."
3,Not so good,"I expected a second disk with fresh material, but this is only the not so good to put in the original record, instead the second disk into the achtung baby is a great material for a fan. The ""remastered"" version is more than welcome."
3,"One of rock group, U2's timeless albums. Good CD item.",This album has all the hot songs that put U2 on the charts. CD had low sound quality! Needs remastering.
5,"A ""Must have"" of some of the smoothest country tunes.","How these guys have managed to stay out of the spotlight is beyond me. Their talent and delivery are superb. From love ballads like ""I Should Have Been True"" to tunes that make it hard for you to stay in your chair (""Dance The Night Away""), there is something for everyone on this CD."
5,The Mavericks a Talented Group with Unique Sound!,"Take talented musicians, a great lead vocalist, terrific song selection, add twenty cuts to one CD with ""NO"" losers = a great buy! Just listen to recent Nashville top 40 radio playlists & you want to gag. Cheap songs that all sound the same, the same for vocalists except they have diffrent names & the same studio session men on every song = boring & ""NO"" I won't buy it! The Mavericks were a breath of talented fresh air with a unique sound. Nashville wonders why their current talent pool isn't selling, garbage + garbage = SAME!"
3,The Hardy Boys Head South,"This review concerns the original 1935 edition.The Hardy Boys and their pal Chet head to the deep South and become involved in an old fued between the Rand and Blackstone families.Modern readers are likely to have their sensibilities offended by the racial sterotypes in this book which cast African-Americans and Southerners in a particularly negative light.Stereotypes aside, this isn't a bad adventure although it certainly doesn't rank among the best in the series."
4,"Hidden passages, criminals, a mysterious monster!","Sneaking around, discovering what other teens or adults were up to, solving crimes, ahh, I loved this series.I read the entire series as a kid, and loved it. It chronicles two brothers and their friends adventures as they solve mysteries of all imaginable kinds. I only learned as an adult that Franklin W Dixon was a pen name used by several different authors, but the series had some great stories. I still enjoy a good mystery.Paul Buckner,author of ""From Broke to Broker, and other stories of finding financial freedom."""
4,The hidden harbor mystery,"As a sixth grader, I thought it was an interesting mystery. What I didn't like about it was I think it needed more action,but it is still worth reading."
4,A thrilling adventure!,The Hardy boys are in a tough case of defeating very strong crimmnals. They a secret harbor that gets them close to solving the mystery.
4,Oh my God!,"I liked it because it was action paced. I liked it when they discover theirs a family treasure to find and when they get trapped on a island, they run out of food and someone takes there boat. They also discover theres something mysterious in the pond."
5,CONNECTING CHORDS WITH LINEAR HARMONY,"Burt Ligon has truely written a very useful and insightful work. He helps aspiring and established jazz players to understand why jazz lines (melodies) work. He gives us a window into a complex art form and helps us get a real handle on jazz's conventional wisdom that might have gone undedected. The book is well researched and the examples and exercises are quickly applicable. You can learn more in the first 10 pages of this book then in all the ""jazz licks"" books. Reading music is necessary."
3,Excellent source of ii-V playing,"I am fed up with ""play this mode/scale over this chord"" text books from Berklee/GIT. Ligon's book is absolutely an excellent source of ii-V playing; however, the lack of consideration of the improvisational context in which communication takes place may result in miscommunication in a situation where jazz improvisation actually involves interacting with the rhythm section. In other respects, this book is rather good. 3.5 stars."
5,Fantastic jazz book !,"Don't loose time looking for other jazz book ! Start with this extremely usefull jazz manual, one of the very few that give you both a theory basis and the pleasure to play at once the jazzy sound you were looking from a long time. Strongly recommended for all musicians who want to enter the world of jazz getting rapidly the correct jazzy tecnique and sound. Bravo Mr.Ligon !DOC M"
3,What you see is NOT what you get!,this is not the same as in the picture! it just got here today and NO I have NOT taken it out of the packet. the white part you see in the pic here.. where you hold it.. is NOT IN HERE. and there is NO ROOM for it.. it must be a seperate attatchment :( the end where you hook it up to the water source.. looks NOTHING like in the picture.. the only part that IS THE SAME is the purple curled hose *slumps*I am NOT HAPPY.
1,"too much jet, not enough love.","first of all, this product does not look like it does in the picture as it does in person. (it is lacking the the white wand with the on and off switch). It is very difficult to set up onto a shower head and once it is set up, the stream is so small and strong it's like a power washer! thus hurting more than pleasuring.Also, it has an option to switch from your regular shower head to the love jet so you don't have to take it off and put it back on every time you use it, which sounds like a good idea, but who wants that unsightly thing hanging from your shower head every day... what if your mother comes to visit!?This product is a good idea, that just wasn't well thought out, and definitely not worth the trouble."
5,A workhorse of a cookbook!,What I really enjoy about this cook book is the simplicity of some of the recipes. It makes you wish you had thought of them. Many do ahead tips that will get you out of the kitchen fast with a meal that seems to have taken far longer to prepare
1,Not extreme low carb.,"There is nothing extreme about this low carb book. Tortillas, rice, pasta? No. If you are diabetic trying to normalize your blood sugars through REALLY low carb, this is not for you."
2,cute but lacking,overall this product is just lacking in functionality. It becomes very staticy and just doesn't stay well in your ear. For the money I would go a little higher and buy a little better.
3,"Good, but a few flaws","This bluetooth works well. Sometimes, it does not want to connect to my phone until I turn the phone on and off (which may actually just be a function of the phone. I have the LG Venus). Really, the only complaint I have is that when I'm on the phone, other people say it sounds like there is an echo. Apparently, it sounds a lot better once I disconnect from the bluetooth. Really, I'm only going to be using this when I'm driving since NJ has passed the law of driving while talking on a cell phone as a primary offense. The bluetooth does last awhile on one battery charge."
3,"Perfect, except for smaller ears like mine","I was so excited when I 1st ordered the BlueAnt X3 micro bluetooth because I ""thought"" I found the perfect one. However, the earbud is kinda large and really doesn't fit in my ear. When I finally maneuvered the included clear earbud, it stays on for like 10 seconds and you can't move your head around or anything. Anyways, the sound is awesome. The functions are easy to use and sync to up to 3 phones. Plus you can charge it with the usb, car, or home charger all included. I would highly recommend it for normal to large ear people. Petite females like me should be cautioned. Love the hot pink."
3,BlueAnt X3 Micro Bluetooth,"Purchased BlueAnt X3 Micro Bluetooth headset a couple of weeks ago for the ability to switch 2 bluetooth enabled devices. Works pretty well. The complaint I have is the small volume button that is hard to push while parked in the ear. Also, after about 4 to 5 hours, it gets a bit uncomfortable. Overall the product works as advertised, however, I have not tried it out in noisy public areas to see how it performs."
3,"Works great, but doesn't fit well.",The X3 is a great headset. I've used several different models from different manufacturers and this one holds up to any. The earbud is rather large and it basically forces me to use the ear hook. That's the only drawback. Set up was simple.
5,Still relevant,"First published in 1980, ""Reaching for Rainbows"" still speaks to the church today 26 years later. The poems, skits, and litanies in this book are easily accessible to anyone who might be in your church or town. Particular favorites, especially for Youth Sunday or drama ministry presentations, are ""You--Sitting in the Pew Next to Me"" and ""Balloons Belong in Church."" Weems is able to give voice to those wonderings and thoughts we have about the relevancy of faith and belief, but few have the courage to voice. Challenge yourself and your congregation. Who knows, God might move the person next to you to be more than just a body in the church!"
5,I couldn't be more in love with this book.,I just received this book a few days ago. I am a pastor and have absolutely loved some of the prayers inside of this book. My husband (who is also a pastor) is attempting to steal it for himself. It helps to think outside of the box and this book is genuine and helpful. It is a great tool for pastors or laity.
1,Does not seem to fit standard aftermarket radios.,"I bought this dash kit to fit a Pioneer DEH-2200UB, that I also purchased from Amazon.com. While the package came in a timely fashion, I can't seem to fit my radio, which is a standard size, into this dash kit."
4,Excellent and Informative Work,A highly informative and comprehensive work. I highly recommend it for those seeking insight into the experience of Catholics during the 20th Century.
2,Bait & Switch,Dividers are NOT included with this item and the foam sucks at best.I will be returning it as soon as the mail truck rolls back around.
4,not so sure about this foam!,"When I purchased the case, I purchased the case with the foam in it. I guess the foam is nice, but is certainly limits what you can put in the case and certainly makes changing what you carry a bit more challenging.the case is amazing.. lots of room and very sturdy, can't beat the price.I think I would have preferred to get the case that had the dividers in it rather than the foam."
5,Protect your gear,Pelican products are renowned for theit strength and durability. That's why I bought one. I am not disappointed. I will not be using anything as a substitute. Couple the goods with Amazon service and nothing more to add.
3,Long,"This book was way longer then I thought. The language makes it a very difficult read, luckily the kindle dictionary made it easier. I still enjoyed it but it was a tough thing to finish."
3,Decent activity for pre-schoolers,"We bought this CD from a school book fair. It's OK. The activities are very, very simple, and range from number and shape recognition to single-digit addition. It's good for introducing kids to using a mouse and to numbers, but my 4-year old ran through the depth and breadth of the game in about 3 months (using it maybe once a week) and became bored by it."
5,EXECELLENT PRODUCT......,"I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY SON WHEN HE WAS TWO AND HE KNEW HOW TO COUNT FROM 1-20, BUT NOW BUT HTIS PRODUCT TAUGHT HIM HOW TO COUNT TO 40. ITS A GREAT PRODUCT THAT HELP WELL WITH COMPUTER SKILLS.I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
5,"Loved it then, but what about now?","My son, who has multiple disabilities, LOVED this program for years. Then, we upgraded computer systems and it won't run on Windows 7. Anyone know if the developer is going to come out with an upgrade for Windows 7, or as an App for iOS, even???? My son still asks for it. :-("
4,Better with each album,The Shins seem to get better with each album. I strongly recommend this album for those who are even mildly interested in The Shins. I can't wait for their next release!Matt ZarnstorffZarnstorff
4,channeling brian wilson,"when i heard this song (phantom limb) first thing that hit me was... is this a long lost beach boys/b. wilson song? or a song about one of the villians from the adultswim cartoon show ""the venture bros."""
3,doesn't quite compare,"The album has a few really good tracks, cathy singles, and so on, but the overall--though it has grown on me and others I know--this album doesn't quite have the spark that the first two did. It seems to fall into the same trap that catches so many ""indie"" bands once the mainstream has caught up to them (see: Death Cab for Cutie's ""Plans"", Mates of State's ""Bring it Back"" and so on...)"
4,An edgier Shins?,"Following where Chutes Too Narrow left off with the hazy, bittersweet ""Those To Come"", The Shins opens Wincing The Night Away with the dreamy, melancholy ""Sleeping Lessons"" that eventually wakes up into a beautiful album. The indie rockers from Oregon keep their name sake with powerful tracks: the ultimately catchy ""Australia"", the Pet Sounds vibrant ""Phantom Limb"", and the eerie ""Black Wave."" Singer/songwriter James Mercer still has plenty to show and tell, which he concurrently underlines over and over with threadlike lyrics that brush softly over dormant emotions. Fans and newcomers alike will flock to the edgier and yet somewhat familiar territory displayed both here and in the band's previous accomplishments."
2,"Too ""easy-listening"" for my taste....","and for that matter too calculated, tame, or harmless. As others have said, it does grow on you, but there's not much of a sense of urgency (unlike its predicessors.) Like the Strokes, with each new album, their music seems to be getting less relevant. Nonetheless, worth getting, no ""skip-tracks"" per se....I like ""sea legs,"" ""phantom limb"" and ""split needles"" the best. Don't make this your first Shins album though..."
2,meh,"It's probably a fine album but I couldn't get into it. I enjoyed albums #1 and #2 much more. It's really not a bad album, just not what I wanted..."
3,Good album + poor mastering = short life.,"This is a pretty good album. Other reviewers have commented sufficiently about the songs and music.It has one outstanding problem that many albums have these days. Someone wanted the CD to be loud. The drums sound awful. Distortion and clipping all over the place. Track 4 has guitar strums that are as loud as the drums, causing the drums to essentially disappear while the guitar is strummed! If it weren't for the fairly prolonged quite parts that The Shins tend to use, the album would be utterly unlistenable. As it is, I can't really bring myself to come back for repeat listens.Another victim of the loudness war I'm afraid."
5,Off With Their Heads!,"I thought Oh, Inverted World was great, however this album is unbelievably GENIUS! I don't say that a lot. Sleeping Lessons, the whole kill the old guard and do good and change the world message is perfect. It is by far my favorite song. It explodes more than 2 minutes in and the whole album has a great energy in it, that's hard to find. Sea Legs- A song I initially thought was ok, but not what I expect of the Shins sound. But would say one of my favorites after a few listens. Black Wave- another song that swells and shrinks sonically and takes you with it. The whole thing has a playful sound and a lot of great changes from Oh, Inverted World and Chutes Too Narrow. This album is definitely one of the best releases this year. My mom even loves it!"
5,THE SHINS' FINEST!!!,"This album is absolutely fantastic. I was less than ecstatic about it at first, but after a few times, I was hooked. Phantom Limb (track #4) might be the best song ever written by any artist...ever. You can't go wrong purchasing this album."
2,not really impressed,I wasnt too impressed with this new album the first two times I listened to it...I jsut tried going over it again to give it a real fair chance...and still it hasnt hit me as being amazing...the verdict is still out.
3,different.,"The CD is certainly more polished than the previous ""Chutes To Narrow"", However, It is not as bouncy and upbeat as CTN. The songs are deeper and a tad darker. It is worth owning. It does have good tunes and that is what matters."
5,Up to Par,"Songs you can listen to over and over and they never get old. I'm listening to it right now! yes Oh, Inverted World is better in my opinion, but this CD has got some killer tracks too, 2,4,6,9,10. They seem to be experimenting with some new sounds on this album, and a lot of it is great!! If your new to The Shins go with Oh, Inverted World, it's a better representation of them in my opinion."
4,Something to keep in mind (4 stars),"You've already read everything there is to say analyzing the actual music, lyrics, etc. So I wont bore you with my take on it except to say that 'Wincing...' is a very solid effort from the Shins and it will probably grow on me like 'Chutes too Narrow' did.The point I want to make is for those considering purchasing the album, but who are concerned that they have 'sold out' and that the music will be affected. 'Wincing the Night Away' is actually still on the Sub Pop record label (the same label as their first two albums). So they haven't jumped to a major sellout label, and I imagine the execs at Sub Pop gave them simple instructions along the lines of 'just keep on doing what you're doing!'Hopefully that will put your mind at ease concerning the creative integrity of this new album. It's not a leap from either of their previous two releases, but it's still refreshing to hear some new tunes from what is possibly America's best band."
5,An Excellent Level Of Growth.,"It's a long and winding road, but I am quite sure that this guys will make it into the mainstream, as they are very talented. This album proves certainly it. Topping this is going to be the challenge... but again, I am sure they will."
3,Good not great,"Sorry to be simplistic here, but this CD is nowhere near as amazing as the Shins' fanboys here are saying (keep drinking the koolaid y'all) nor as bad as some naysayers are claiming. There are some good songs on here, and I don't think I would've wanted them to repeat the formula of Chutes Too Narrow (even though I loved it) over and over again, CD after CD. They did try some new things on here and I don't find Wincing boring in the least, I just think that Chutes was so great there was no way they were going to match it and so even though this may feel like a bit of a step backwards, it's more like a step sideways, if that makes sense."
4,Yay! Me Likey!,"My favorites are Phantom Limb and Sea Legs. They sound more relaxed and enjoying themselves, yet keeping the whole album cohesive and coherent.I think they will have many many more albums in the future, the good ones even."
4,good stuff- again,"I really like the first two albums better, but it took me some time to get to like them as much as I do now. Perhaps that's the same with Wincing. This album showcases a new mixture of beats and sound effects that they only touched on in Chutes and didn't even contemplate on their first album. The songs are still easy to hum along to and the lyrics are still deep.Way to Go!"
3,Same old good stuff from The Shins.,"Quite a fuss was made before this album came out about how the Shins had re-tooled their sound. I don't hear that. I hear the same beautiful melodies I've come to expect from The Shins, and that's fine by me. However, a few of the songs made me just want to put on Oh, Inverted World or Chutes Too Narrow, and that's probably not a great thing. But it's still an enjoyable album."
3,go buy oh inverted world by the shins,"it is hundreds of times better. i think the shins lost their touch or somthing on this latest album.their previous was their best, their latest is their worst"
4,Who the Hell Designed the Lyric Sheet?,"I don't have any earlier Shins to compare this record to, but overall it's not a bad album from just listening to it two times straight thru. My fav is the opening track, ""Sleeping Lessons"".I like to read the lyrics while listening but some ""artist"" decided to splash them hodge podge over multiple pages in print that's meant for someone with younger eyes than mine. What a freakin' waste of paper. Glad to see less plastic overall though."
4,Shins,"Great CD. Reminds me of what I grew up with--alternative, indie rock I grew up listening to in the 80's and early 90's."
5,Oh So Lovely!,A beautifully written album which no doubt gives the world a slightly more accessable entry into Shinspace. Their best work yet? Hard to say but the fun factor is there making it a summery favourite for punters and music critics alike.
4,Like a nearly perfect summer's day spent swimming in ocean,"Being the 145th reviewer here, there is little to add. Without delving too deeply into the music or musicians (I'll leave that for others), I would recommend ""Wincing the Night Away"" for its creativity and craft.Listening to the songs is like a nearly perfect summer's day spent swimming in ocean: awash with sounds and enough surprises to keep from being lulled to sleep. I consider this recording to be one of those guilty pleasures--something I never thought I would like to this degree."
4,straight to the point --->,"This is first-rate Shins. They sound more relaxed and confident than ever and their gorgeous pop melodies shine as always. Four stars because Mercer's singing style can get a bit ""same-y"" sounding after a while, but his melodic sensibility, quirkiness and keen observations on life are in full effect."
5,Vinyl LP comes with coupon for MP3 Download of album,"This is not a review of the album (which is great) - if you're here looking at a vinyl Shins LP, you probably know you like their music. However, if you are deciding whether to get the LP or CD, take into account that the good people at Sub Pop included a coupon with the LP so you can download the album in MP3 format for free. (At least, a coupon came inside my copy of the LP that I ordered from Amazon)Happy vinyl hunting."
4,"A long wait. A good album, but no Chute's Too Narrow","The first time I hear CTN, I was blown away. So many great hooks, so many good lyrics, one good song after another. (I'm not one of those people who thought Oh Inverted World was better than CTN.) After listening to WTNA, I was left feeling a bit unsatisfied. There are some great numbers on here, don't get me wrong, but too many years have passed for this album to not be a LITTLE BIT better than it is. One more really good song would have done the trick. Still, new Shins is better than no Shins."
2,Please enter a title for your review,The Shins are good at strumming standard hamonyless chords in rudimentary patterns without any distinctive rhythm or melody.
3,Not bad for the money.,"I needed a cheap keyboard that I could use from my couch. This one feels like it was made out of recycled milk jugs, and has distinctly Fisher-Price key action. But it's inexpensive and seems durable (meaning drop-proof, not spill-proof). The USB cable is about five feet long so I needed an extension cable to reach my HTPC. There's also no channel on the underside of the keyboard to route the cable left or right. I've purchased other Belkin products (ethernet card, noise-canceling headphones) and found them to represent good value. Spend more if you want better key action, but this is a perfectly good second or third keyboard, or one you would give a child if there's a good chance it'll get knocked around a bit."
1,Error on price of dog food,"I ordered this as it is the food I always use and pay $52 for the large bag, didn't realize I was getting the small 4.4 lb bag. This is not a deal. It is higher than I pay at the pet store!"
1,Not a good price,Got this same 4.4 lb bag at PetSmart for $6. Not a good price Amazon! Our dog loves it though.
2,makes nasty loose poo!,makes nasty loose poo! the dry does the same thing. i've used the puppy & adult formulas with my puppy & 8 year old dog. both get the icky loose and STINKY poo!
1,Bait and switch?,"At first glance I thought what a great deal, then I read some of the other reviews and looked a little closer. This claims that the regular list price is $51 for a 4 pound bag?GIVE ME A BREAK! Seriously, Amazon????"
2,so so,"Expected a lot more from the reviews. Was just okay, if I'd known what it really was like I would never have bougtht it.Boring, dosn't really show a lot of creative decorating etc. Not much of the event this was leading up to either."
3,OK,"I bought this for my niece who at age 13 is an incredible baker. About 1/3 cup through this film the whole thing fell flat. I'm sure she'll enjoy it but what we think about ""Pastry"" over here in America is obviously not ""Giant Sugar Sculptures.""We think of stuffed croissants, muffins, lard fried donuts, cupcakes, and comfort - yeast based edibles."
3,Canned wahoo in Extra Virgin Olive Oil would be healthier,"The reason many people don't buy this product (Van Camp's Chunk Style Wahoo in soybean oil) is that it would be healthier for us to eat it if it were canned in either water, olive oil, or extra virgin olive oil. Scientific studies say that people who use olive oil live about 3 to 5 years longer on average than people who use any other vegetable oil. Extra virgin olive oil has never been heated and is rich in beneficial phytochemicals. Regular olive oil has been heated like all of the other vegetable oils sold in the supermarket."
5,Season 2.....WHERE IS IT?,"Me being a 227 fan, i am looking for the 2nd season and i cant find it because its not released YET! COme on people get the 2nd season on NOW! Martin 2nd season is coming out in MAY, come on and lets do this and release release release.............DANG IT!"
5,It;s about time!!!!!!,"I've been waiting for this for a long time now! Now, if they would only bring The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air to DVD."
4,Good TV,"Ahhh, the memories of good, clean television. No swearing, naked bodies, violence or gyrating bodies. This was a good time, back when TV was innocent and family-oriented. I can watch this DVD season with my teenaged daughter and not be worried that there will be any inappropriate scenes. Not so in today's TV sitcoms. Marla Gibbs and cast had a great thing going back then. Come back to TV Land!"
5,The best ever.,"Back when this program was on television and I was living in a rural area and didn't have a tv, I happily drove 25 miles one way to a friends house every week just to see this show. For years I waited for it to come out again and was thrilled when they made the first season available. Let's hope they come out with the full series or at least start releasing it year by year so we can enjoy the rest of the episodes. This was and still is the best sitcom I have ever seen and it's every bit as funny as I remembered."
4,Picture Frame,"This picture frame did the trick, it was nice and was shipped quickly and safely, no broken glass...okey dokey than.."
2,Poor product and packaging quality,"The item is cheaply made, very fragile. It was wrapped in a thin layer of bubble wrap with some brown paper inside a huge box. Arrived damaged. Called Amazon, told me to throw it away and they sent another overnight as this was to be part of an anniversary gift. Second one arrived in exact same packaging, damaged. Called Amazon again, they wanted me to pack it up and take it to UPS store for returns. I told them I was not going to do that since now I have to rush around looking for another one. Asked for supervisor, rep came back on they told me to throw both away and issued me a refund.Product itself looks nice but cheap, chipped and damaged due to shipping. Would not recommend ordering since their shipping and handling failed twice. It will just arrive damaged."
1,Web looks can REALLY be deceiving.,"This product looks very little like it does on the website. In real life, the frame (which is said to be wood, and may well be) looks like cheap plastic. In fact, I've seen cheap plastic that looked more like wood than this so-called 'solid wood' frame. On the web, the frame has subtle shadows of almost black along the scroll work which makes it look understated, dark and elegant. In person, the frame does have the scroll work but the entire thing is a flat brown color - no shading, no subtle black shadows. Stupidly, I tried to add the shading with an artist's pen. It definitely looks better but not good enough to give as a present and now I can't return it either (totally my fault). I have not been this deceived from digital to daylight since the last time I tried internet dating."
2,"Should be call ""100 Most Unusual Letters""","I thought the book dealt with letters that were so ""out of the ordinary"" that it would be a rare occasion that you would actually need to send one of these."
3,Digital cable (on Xp),"Although software from Microsoft doesn't acknowlege the possibility of digital channels on cable, this does come with ArcSoft's ""Total Media 3"".Total Media 3 was discontinued early in 2007, before Windows Vista came out, but does work (with some glitches) if your PC has Windows Xp.Unlike the Kworld PCI-120 card that came out later (it's lo-profile, for ""Pizza box"" cases) this PCI-115 can run with other DVR software, including DVR software for Linux.The MyHD card by MIT (MacroImageTechnology) is the one that can process digital channels on-board (an ancient 400Mhz Pentium II PC can work) but costs more, all other cards off-load digital channel decoding to a fast Pentium4 CPU (or better), this one included. I got ""sputtering"" sound watching the PBS HD Showcase channel until I replaced my CPU with a faster one."
1,seller sold me an old dried up bottle,"The seller shipped me a very OLD container. It was crumbly and didn't even attach. It ruined a project day, and I had to go to the store and buy some. Worthless. Here's a picture taken AFTER I used the iron on it. Peels right off.(...)"
2,Too much information,"If you are doing a research project on this topic, and need to know who died where and what time they were at what place, this book will be very useful. I had just a casual interest (drove though the area on a recent vacation) so I found it was way more than I wanted to know. Writing is somewhat dry. But, now I know all about it!"
4,It is what it says it is.,This is a good place to start out studying for the GMAT. This book does not teach you tricks of how to do problems faster. It briefly reviews the math and verbal rules that are needed to do all the problems. It has tons of practice problems with detailed answers.
2,Good for having a variety of practice problems,"There is plenty of practice and the answer explanations are pretty decent. In regards to the sections where they help you prepare for the different parts of the test, those are pretty horrible and lacking content. Luckily I had studied for the LSAT and had used the Powerscore Bibles, so I had a strong grasp for critical reasoning and reading comp, but where I needed some guidance was in the sentence correction. Because I was disappointed in this series of books I turned back to the Powerscore series (Sentence Correction Powerscore Bible). EXCELLENT. I really have a better understanding of what the GMAT will be testing and how to study for that. My Verbal score has improved drastically."
1,Waste of time,"Please, don't waste your time on test preparation. Your time will be much better spent if you study real mathematics."
5,abhi,"Being official guide, it gives most closest look at GMAT questions. Required book for GMAT preparation"
2,Get high score in GMAT,"There are lot of sample questions but GMAT is CAT, and this book doesn't help you to understand which question are more difficult"
4,"Good for review, not for teaching","Book is helpful mainly as a long list of sample questions and answers. Doesn't provide much teaching of what you need to know in certain sections (eg the math section doesn't cover some of the more complex rules of geometry etc that you need to answer the questions). Advice on how to take the test is pretty basic too. I would say this is a good book if you are reasonably confident that you will do well and it really is just a review book to remind you of a few things you may have forgotten; the answers are clear and well written, and so are helpful for 'brushing up' on what you may have forgotten, although at least one is wrong (or not fully right), and there are quite a few typos, but if you know your stuff this won't really through you off (beyond the fear that there could be mistakes on the GMAT itself!)"
4,Powerprep practice exams not reflective of true GMAT score,"Don't panic if you get low scores on Powerprep practice exam. Check out my scores:Kaplan (first try): 530Powerprep 1: 600Powerprep 2: 590Powerprep 3: 610Actual GMAT score: 670 (88th percentile)This book is GREAT practice, as the problems are all old GMAT problems. Keep in mind that the HARD problems are in the last 100 questions of each section. The easy ones are in the first couple hundred, and might waste your time.This book has answer explanations, but NO tips or tricks. Definitely use this book along with the Kaplan and/or Princeton review books. The tips and tricks are what help you solve the tricky problems in the limited time available."
2,"What the hell, GMAC?","Haven't taken the GMAT yet, but I have to review this book because it kind of sucks and it's frustrating. I have found more than several misprints, and just some weird information in there that just isn't right. I bought this because I wanted at least a feel for what I am going to be up against when I take the actual GMAT, but I can't believe how there are misprints and inaccuracies in this book. How will people be truly prepared, if that's the case?!The math review is helpful, but there is little to no advice when it comes to the sections regarding data sufficiency and sentence correction. One of the tips for sentence correction just tells you to read! Books, newspaper, whatever, because they generally use correct grammar. What?! Seriously, GMAC?I use the problems in this book for drill, in tandem with the Princeton Review books for strategies. I think that's the best way to go. I sure hope the 12th edition has improved on the misprints and whatnot... buyer beware!"
4,Great practice tool,"This book isn't going to give you a lot of test-taking strategy, but it is a great resource for assessing where you are when you start and providing plenty of practice questions for the areas you need to focus on. The GMAT Review is the only book where you'll find actual GMAT questions. For test-taking strategy I recommend the Princetone Review Cracking the GMAT book. I am using both books."
5,Great product and timely delivery,The book was in great condition and got it fairly quickly in the mail.
2,"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition",Not enough explanation to carry over into real time test taking.
1,Be Careful What you Trust,"Having spent 30 minutes studying out of the Math review section, I found considerable errors similar to others who posted. I've found 7 in 20 pages. Come on.The errors go beyond having ""x2"" instead of x^2. The errors go to basic concepts that if a trusting reader were to follow, the test-taker would be in trouble. Sometimes the diagrams don't match the word descriptions. In the review of coordinate geometry, the equations given and the graph representation are way off. If you don't have your high school notes handy or are a little more than rusty, this could hurt you.While I'm sure the rest of the book is helpful, I am giving this 1-star because it smacks of laziness and it's kind of insulting. It's troubling to think that these mistakes are acceptable for an organization that administers a major graduate admissions test. We wouldn't get into B-schools with errors like these.To the GMAC: take notes from the LSAC, and leave the test review to the pros."
3,not that authoritative when it contains lots of errors,"Don't be fooled by the word ""Official"". It has considerable amount of errors."
4,GMAT Book,"This book is good and was very helpfull in my GMAT prep. The verbal section covers alot, but its advisable to improve it over the period of time. A crash course in verbal is not possible and feasable."
4,Good Idea to have,It gives a good idea of the type sof question. The untimeddiagnostic test had pretty good question must do them. The practice questions are easier that them.
4,Just what i wanted!!,I received the package right when I needed it and so far I have found it to be helpful. But if what you need is a more thorough review I suggest buying books that will better help refresh your mind on the math along with this book. The book mainly contains questions and answers but not enough for someone who's very rusty on the material.
4,Good book but with some typo's,"Math section has many typo's (more than 10 for sure), use google to find the corrections. Apart from that its good."
1,Lousy Quantitative Section/No Tips or Strategies,"This book stinks. It has a VERY limited review of the concepts covered in the math section of the GMAT and absolutely no strategies on how to get a high score on the test.If you're rusty in high school level math, you're going need a serious review, which this book does not provide.This book is mearly a catelog of old GMAT questions for the user to practice with."
4,This book is a good resource,"I decided to buy this book, bt following the advice of others in Amazon.com I also bought ""Cracking the GMAT"" and ""Verbal Workout"".The firstone tells you about strategies and techniques, like the official guide, but from the point of view of an external entity. This is great, because tells you for example how studying less you can get better results, or the tricks to use during the exams to make the things easier.I bought the Verbal Workout because it was cheap and I needed to improve my verbal skills. It is not soy good as ""cracking the GMAT"", but gives yuo extra material an some ideas to be used in the exam.In summary, use cracking the GMAT to study as essential book, and the two other to be use for consulting or extra work.Here is Jose, from Sevilla, south of spain. I have my GMAT in 2 weeks, pray to the god ETS to give me a good puntuation."
3,The Official Guide for GMAT Review,I think this guide is comprehensive but a little too easier than the actually test.
3,GMAT Review 11th edition,The product itself is fine. The problem is Amazon promotes this book as their primary GMAT Review offering while the support materials I ordered at the same time (promoted along side this edition on the website) refer to the new 12th edition GMAT Review. I realize 'you' want to be rid of 'your' old books but it does me little good when the references I am looking for are not in the book I purchased. I am a little disappointed.
2,good but EXTREMELY SLOW shipping!,"good packaging, book in good condition but i got the book 1 and half weeks after the order. The slowest shipping ever experienced..."
5,"The Official Guide for GMAT Review, 11th Edition","The Book i ordered was delivered in 2-3 days, and in good quality."
4,GMAT book review,"The book is useful because it has questions that were asked in the previous tests and it gives you an idea of what type of questions to expect.In plus, there are so many questions you don't feel like you are wasting your time!"
3,Good supplemental review book,"I purchased this book as my primary study book for the GMAT but I think it makes a better supplement to the Princeton Review or Barrons book since it has tons of problems but no actual tests. I didn't realize that until I bought it so be warned. If you are just looking to do question afer question to get practice, with none of the time contraints you face in the actual GMAT, this is the book for you. I found it useful overall, but not as useful as I thought I would. One last point, in terms of knowledge and improved learning, the quant explanations are very very useful, but the grammar and sentence correction ones didn't really help me improve my score."
1,Poor preparation material,"This book begins by stating that it is virtually all you will need in order to score well on the GMAT. I went through the book backwards and forwards - again and again and again. Mind you, I have an MBA from a very good school already and am well able to study and master material. Upon taking the GMAT for my PhD program, the test had nothing even remotely similar to what this book prepared me for. Certainly, there are basic math principles involved, but the overall format and question types in this book didn't at all resemble what I was tested over on the actual GMAT. Outside of that, I was amazed at the number of grammatical errors in the book, especially as it is an 11th edition. Many of the exercises have incorrect verbiage and/or signage as it relates to math problems. If you are getting prepared to take the GMAT, you had better not leave it to this product."
5,Great book,"It is a must-have for every GMAT takers. It provides you lots of practice questions from past exams, which are in the same style as those that will appear in the actual exam. Practice with them improves your confidence. Highly recommended."
4,Sufficiently Pleased,"I bought this book to be used as the required text for a GMAT prep course I am taking.I've only been using the book for a week now, so my review is still in it's very early stages.Two things I might mention:1. Another student in my class bought the same book,same edition through Amazon. Her book is oddly enough different from mine. A good way to check to see if you've received a more recent version is to go the to Data Sufficiecny section. At the beginning of that section there are the ""Directions"". The most recent book will have Directions A through E. The slightly older version will have Directions A through D. MAKE SURE YOU GET THE VERSION WITH A-E!!!!2. The review of basic math skills could offer more. If you haven't used these skills in some time, you will find other resources will be necessary in order to regain those skills. I've been using online materials to help me."
2,Not bad but not good,"This album is just what my review title says it is, it is not bad but it is not good, in short catchy guitar riffs, a lot of rapping , most of it is pretty annyoing, and some singing, Broken Home saves the album for what it is..."
5,Roach Rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!,"papa roach is so tight !!!! I think this album better than the first one,cause the mix a lot of kinds of music to gether and thats really sweet.last resort has a catchy sound in it and the lyrcs really good.if any one is still deciding on bying this cd I highly recomend it.rock on"
4,PAPA ROACH IS A MUST HAVE!!!!!!,"Papa Roach delivers an amazing CD with great songs including: ""Last Resort,"" ""Broken Home,"" and ""Between Angels and Insects."" Their hard rock mixed with hip hop mixed with everything else delivers a new sound that will form a mosh pit every time it is played. It's just a great CD!"
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"when i first heard ""last resort"", i thought that it was pretty good and was worth a try buying the cd. i turned on my player, and all i heard was a guy whining about his poor life and telling us that ""it's in our nature to kill ourselves"" or something like that. all the songs sound exactly alike and the lyrics are terrible. don't waste your well-earned money on this cd. i would have given the cd 1 star, but i gave them 2 just for trying."
1,The only infesting done here is to good music,"Infest is another attempt, albeit an older one, at mixing music styles. There is a little bit more singing on this album than some of the albums anteceding it, but the predominant vocal style is rap, often over a metal or rock style guitar and bass pattern, and this is especially evident in ""Last Resort."" Sorry, but this album is a poor attempt at fitting into the whole scheme of rock, and it's a shame that some of its songs get a lot of airtime on good rock stations."
1,Seriously UNTALENTED Rock Group who LACKS Originality,"I guarentee most rock fans who first heard ""Last Resort"" liked it. I did anyway. I had hopes for this band but these guys are simply HORRIBLE live which sais a lot! They are incredibly off beat and the guitar players sound like my little cousin on his plastic Banjo. Maybe that was a little exagerated but they are seriously bad live which means they really need work in the studio, thats where they get the videos and make it sound so good. These guys also stole riffs from Tool and Limp Bizkit. Im not sure which tracks, maybe 4 and 5. These guys are unorignal and all around horrible band. I can see little 10 year olds liking this but they simply sicken me. Avoid this CD if you enjoy original hard rock beats. These guys are too mainstream to cater to the hard rock fan. They cater to what TRL wants to hear. Theyll be gone in a few months (I Hope)"
1,Buck this trend! It's pretty mediocre..,"I first heard of Papa Roach at a free Stone Temple Pilots gig in a San Diego parking lot, where a guy from a record label was passing out promo CDs. He said they were kind of like Korn, but much better. I went home, popped in the CD, and heard... Therapy, an Irish rock band that never sold well in the US (their best album Troublegum, is out of print here.). This is good, I don't like Korn anyway. But being an STP fan, I like more exciting, intelligent music, and I emphasize music instead of lyrics because too many people think in terms of that instead of the underlying musical base. Papa Roach is simply conventional and trendy. Nothing new or revolutionary, and it doesn't even sound that great."
2,Grandpa Roach,"O.K,to get started,Papa Roach (or vuelito cucaracha)made one hell of a hit that BLEW my goddamn mind.You all know it,you all love it and right you are it's LAST RESORT and i thought ""wow i think it's a great promise"",i bought it and EEEEEEEEEEEEH, big mistake. Beside Last Resort there is plus one or two decent songs, but the truth is this:this is not an album, it's an uncovered insecticide (at least is better than that stupid album from Allen Eat Fart,know what i mean right?).Dont buy this just because you liked Last Resort or this will really cut your life into pieces."
4,Great,"I thought this was a great CD. I loved the music, and the songs. I really like the songs of Broken Home, and Last Resort. I dont know what everyone is complaining about. Its hard to find a band that can blend the styles they have and pull it off. I say this is a great buy. I gave it 4 not 5 stars because very few cds qualify for 5 stars."
3,"For a summer away in Orlando, while watching ...TV...","I bought this Papa Roach album because of their awesome song ""Last Resort"", which was overplayed on ...TV one summer. ... I'd have to say that these guys, minus their attempt of scaring the elders, are pretty good. I'm not a big fan of metal rock (except I love Incubus) or rap rock for that matter. And the guitar riffs are awfully repeated throughout the album. The only thing that stands out are Coby's wonderful screams. It's just okay."
4,"A bit over-produced, but it's still worth buying if...","you're into the rap...-core thing. Hardcore purists may object, but I think it passes the ""deathtone"" litmus test at an acceptable level (e.g. Tool, Rage Against.., etc.). I wish every song had a more edgy-sound like the #4 track ""Dead Cell,"" but then again, not too many bands will even push their sound that far. I think bands [who do the rap-core thing] like Primer 55 have a more fat, raw tone, but it's a matter of preferrence... I like bands like Soulfly, Fear Factory, and Machinehead who push their tone to a psychotic level, but a lot of my friends are more into the ""polished"" sound... plus this is a disc that I can throw on when my girlfriend's around and I want to listen to something edgy and not have to resort to listening to Limp Biskit. Don't judge this band by their overplayed and overhyped song ""Last Resort""... there are other good tunes on this disc."
2,Way Overated,I Personally think that PRoach is way overated as a band just because they had one really good song Last Resort this album doesn't live up to the performance they gave on that single
1,"oh man, metal has reached a new low","This is to ""agentboney""...If infest is the best CD that you own than I really really really feel sorry for you. Quit watching MTV and check out some real music like Vision of Disorder or Nothingface. This album is terrible and the guys are the fakest bunch of poseurs I've ever seen. Wake up people!!!! There is so much better music out there that you don't know about because your stuck in your precious little MTV world."
5,The Greatest Album Ever Made,"This must be the single greates album ever made. Nothing else i have even compare to this except ""The Sickness"".Every song on here is worth a 5/5 except ""Tight Rope"" and ""Never Enough"" which deserve a 4/5. Coby realy brings out his inner demons and aggresition on this album. This is what put Papa Roach on the market.His Rap-Metal is flawless. There isn't too much rapping as Rage Against the machine sometimes tends to do. The great part is it isn't all obnocious screaming.As i said before, this album is No.1 and probably always will be with ""The sickness"" Following Close behind. I realy wish Coby would have made Love Hate Trajety sound like this album did. He didn't and the sales #'s show. When you have something good going for you dont try to change it. ""If it aint broke dont fix it"" the best lesson you'll ever learn.Buy this album. You will not be dissapointed."
2,No Impressed,At first I like Papa Roach but once you start listening to them for a while they get old and boring. They are just trying to be a depressed-rock-rap group. This cd isn't very original and if you haven't heard it you aren't missing much.
1,This is an insult to heavy metal,"This album is, as I have noted above, an insult to heavy metal. Papa Roach is your typical rap metal band. They are what I, and the rest of the legitimate metal community, refer to as posers. They act hardcore, but in reality are not hardcore at all. I would have to say the worst song on here is ""Broken Home."" Like all (c)Rap metal songs it talks about how the persons life [is awful] and wahh wahh wahh. Another song on this album that [I don't like]... is ""Last Resort."" What made everyone think it was so great, If I wanna hear some second rate little fairy whining about suicide I'll listen to those posers KoRn. In reference to agentboy's review: if this is the best CD you own, I pitty you. I wish people would stop buying ...[CD's] like Papa Roach and Korn so (c)Rap Metal would die out."
4,Original rap-core cd hits the store!,"This album is chopped full of good rap lyrics that puts Fred Durst to SHAME! Songs such as ""Dead Cell"" and ""Broken Home"" will prove it to you. This is a good album for those who like their rap-core with substance; and not every other song on an album WHINING about how the critics are giving them a hard time (ahem...ahem...Limp Bizkit.) Talent is crawling ALL over this album. So pick up ""Infest"", and just have and all out rock of a good time."
1,0 stars,"Papa roach are one of the most over rated bands in todays music. Papa roach are a [bad] band who borrow their guitar riffs from bands like iron maiden. They are also very unoriginal, like the singer has the most boring voice, and he complains about very stupid things. If you want a band that complains, try out korn the only good band that likes to complain. The guitarist is also stupid seeming he rips off bands guitar riffs, and the music is just very plain like dry toast. If you want a more unoriginal band with talent, check out system of a down, atleast they have better things to complain about like wars and stuff. So if your thinking about getting this album, don't buy it, don't encourage them to put out more [stuff] in todays music..."
1,WTF?,"When I first heard of ""Papa Roach"" I thought they may be good. My friends said the song 'Last Resort' was stuck in their heads, so I decided to sample the song. What I heard was Limp Bizkit style music with guitar and rap, and singing (rapping) stuff like 'My family doesn't care about me, do you care if I cut myself and bleed and die? My life is depressing and it started when I lost my mother'. I pressed 'stop' immediately."
4,"Hey, it's really good.","I heard about these guys a while back, and I finally got the chance to hear them in March. There's been a slump in good CD releases recently, and for me this marked the begining of the summer release swarm. Can't wait for the new Britny Spears =/. Papa Roach have a good grip on what they're doing and really get down and dirty talking about the Mtv generations problems. You can identify with his way of thinking. I really like ""Dead Cell"" and of course ""Last Resort"". They're good songs when you're [angry]. They fit in the agro/rap-core genere, but they also expand outside that to touch on other styles. That's what really held me back from the 5-stars."
4,A wicked new band for any hard rock fan.,"This CD rocks! It's unfortunate that they are going to be compared to Limp Bizkit because they are WAY better. Sure it may be ""RapMetal"" but if you listen closer you will discover more. There are no sellout songs on this album like ""nookie"". Cody has great vocal range and the drumming (although sometimes simplistic) works very well. The songs immediately get your head bobbing and don't let go. A must buy for any fan of the current rock movement."
5,Great Effort,"I saw a reviewer down below say that this band is trendy. So what, the CD is good and it's the type of cd that you can just press play and listen through the whole thing. Last Resort is an excellent song, along with Broken Home, Dead Cell, among others. I seriously like the whole thing. They do not sound like Korn. Personally I don't think they are anywhere near the level of Korn, but it's their first nationaly released album. . . Buy it, if you like Rage, Limp, Korn, Kid Rock etc. You'll enjoy this."
4,This is my last resort...,"Papa Roach's first major label CD INFEST is a great metal album with sweet rap by Mr. Dick. Songs like ""Infest"", ""Snakes"", and the wicked single ""Last Resort"" pump you up and get stuck in your head. Buy it before they become huge, which is bound to be very soon."
2,infest should be insest!!!!,"papa roach sucks so bad, why anybody gave these guys a recoring label is beyond me. their songs are so lame, they had one hit but nothing else will come frome these guys! please i'm begging you don't waste your money!"
3,Before Jacoby Shaddix,"Amazing guitar hooks and moving lyrics, what more can one want? A wee bit more... Welcome to the world of Colby Dick where white boy rap rules the scene. Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, and Papa Roach's Colby dick. A classis way to ruin a perfectly good rock album. My advice is to forget this cd ever happened and pick up Getting Away With Murder and Lovehatetravedy."
4,Good nu-metal,"This is one of the first rock/metal albyms I've ever bought, and now (4 years later) I still think it's pretty good. Here's my opinion for each of the songs:1. Infest 8/102. Last Resort 9/103. Broken Home 10/104. Dead Cell 4/105. Between Angels and Insects 8/106. Blood Brothers 7/107. Revenge 7/108. Snakes 7/109. Never Enough 8/1010. Binge 9/1011. Thrown Away 9/10BONUS TRACK - 8/10"
1,This is the equivalence of smegma.,"So you like MTV??? MTV only scratches the surface of what's out there musically....papa roach is just as fake and lame as limp bizket, Britney Spears and wwf wrestling and all the other marketed garbage that appeals to the narrow-minded masses of this day and age....PAPA ROACH IS THE EPITOME OF CRAP."
2,So unbelievably repetitive...,"Oh dear - what a corny load of rubbish this is.Does every record have to sound the same?!Papa Roach make one record that (allegedly) takes the rock world by storm (""Last Resort"") and then make every other record sound the same. My girlfriend liked this band at first, but even she admits to them being a one-trick pony...And the videos they make to go with the singles - can they get any more cornier, too?! God, if I see one more depressed teenager staring at the camera in a Papa Roach video, I'll probably end up kicking the tv in!A word of advice to the Papa Roachers:You can only go so far with ""teen angst"" and you've already gone way beyond that point within 3 singles... Try something new!I'll stick to the Bloodhound Gang - they're far more entertaining and a lot less depressing than this barrel of ****!"
3,Good for the Papa Roach fan who hasn't already bought the CD,"It's a good cd, but some of the extras aren't really necessary. Who needs an edited version of Legacy? If you want that you could just buy the edited cd. If you like just a few Papa Roach songs, just buy infest which is a very good CD. If you are a real fan and you don't already have the CD, this is for you."
2,I hope Steve Harris will sue...,"ill admit ive only heard Last Resort, Broken Home and Revenge but i am shocked at the plagiarism of Iron Maiden.Iron Maidens most appealing feature is the amazing harmony riffs (use that bit in Last Resort as an example) and they have been ripped off down to the very NOTE by Papa Roach.the results are exciting and new sounding but they have stolen, without credit several maiden riffs.Buy if you want but this is not original stuff."
1,This band must be stopped...,"...I know there is nothing wrong with the Roach, they keep it real y'know, they make a lot of kids happy, etc. But they're really really bad. And maybe Coby Dick had an awful life, but the whining quality of his lyrics and vocals deprive you of any sympathy... unless, of course, you're feeling, like, down, man, cos life's a real bummer. This irrational dislike may be entirely due to 2 things; the horrific overplaying of ""Last Resort"" on [a] 7-tracks-over-and-over-again-all-day playlist. And Coby Dick's stupid dancing on the ""Between Angels and Insects"" video (shallow, me?!). Good things? Um, the last 20 seconds of Broken Home are great - no no don't buy the CD for that alone. God, please please don't. Papa Roach are marketed as a mix of metal, punk and rap. If you want metal, try Amen. Punk? The Clash. Rap? Don't know. Sorry. But just avoid this like a ferocious pitbull. Or, for that matter, an unferocious whinging guy called Coby Dick."
3,good but still lacks alot of energy,This cd consists of mostly cries for help. Jonathon Davis made this popular and I feel a little let down to see that when other bands are going to try this that it comes out like it did on this. Also many of the songs have almost exactly similar beats and measures. This cd is for the type who like pop music like third eye blind.
1,well.......,"Where do i start ???Papa Roach are a quartet of lousy so called musicians,who have hit the pop charts by ripping off an iron maiden riff.The singer - an arrogant pompous prententious excuse for a front man who seems as political as an onion, with his bold statements of ""F**K The Presidant"", which by the way come from his rejection of a visit to the white house, due to him wearing jeans.He can't sing or shout, and frankly belongs in macdonalds...Maybe he should sing in tune next time..alternatively they could release a karaoke version of the album,which i expect wouldsell betterGuitarist - must have watched 'how to play rock guitar' before recording the album. Next time lets hope he takes some lessons.Bassist - struggles to keepup with the guitarist,need i say more??Drummer- need to get in shape so he can drum,he must get tired during the songs.If tasteless distortion, with simple drum beats and a drunk fool wailing over the top is your thing,this is for you.Highly recomended for a laugh"
3,Decent rap-rock,"Papa Roach's ""Infest"" is one of those CD's that either you love or you hate, but I am somewhere in the grey area. At times, I really like this CD, but then I'll pop it in and think ""God, this is cheesy."" Part of what brings this CD down is Coby's lousy lyrics. Read the lyrics to their hits ""Broken Home"" and ""Last Resort"" even Jonathan Davis from Korn is more subtle than this. Jerry Horton's guitarwork, however, is absolutely stunning. He really shines on ""Blood Brothers,"" my favorite song on this CD. Other songs I liked ""Never Enough"" ""Dead Cell"" ""Between Angels & Insects"" and the hidden track, ""Tightrope."" It's a decent CD, but I recommend ""Lovehatetragedy"" over this, that CD is loads better."
4,"""Trendy"", ""Trendy"", ""Trendy"", ""Trendy"", ""Trendy"".","Ok, is it just me or is the word ""trendy"" just thrown into reviews here so that someone can seem like an all-important-elitist-metal head?Another problem that plagues these reviews, is the extreme overuse of comparing them to other metal bands, more often than not non-rap/metal bands. You people fail to remember that this is a review about the album at hand (Infest). Wheter or not you find it to be a strong album with a good dilivery, or weak album with bad delivery too often seems unimportant to more than half of the reviewers.*Sighs*Moving onto the album, I find that, although not exctremly origional, it's a strong album that's been well recorded and shows a lot of promise for future projects to come."
2,Grrreat!,"Nice Lyrics. Yeah, maybe if you were illiterate. These guys got famous from stealing an Iron Maiden riff. C'mon people. (Powerslave)"
5,Wow!,"I think Infest is one of the best albums of the year so far. My mom made me get the Wal-Mart clean version, but that doesnt take away anything! My fav songs are 1 and 5 through 8."
5,A great band,"Papa Roach is tight and works well. We've all heard the first single ""Last Resort"" playing on our local modern/active rock stations but there's much more to this band than just that one song. Singer Coby Dick has an awesome style of rapping but can also sing as well. My favorite track being ""Blood Brothers"" which features lyrics that will give you the chills but in fact, are very very true. The songs on this CD tell tales of his life which he decided to tell us about and believe me, the songs are very, very personal. ""Broken Home"" has a great guitar effect and speaks of just that, a broken home. The songs on Infest rock and are full of feeling and meaning, which is exactly what music is supposed to be."
5,Great CD... but,I think this CD is excellent. There may be those people that say they are just like all the new bands but they're not. I think rock still has places to go. And well I like this group and they have a lotta potential if they choose to not sell out. But I dont know if Im the only person who noticed this but the guitars on Last Resort sound a lot like Green Day's - Brain Stew. Does anyone else agree with me?
3,bad lyrics,"lyrically, this album is unbelievably horrible. thanks to the good music in the backround it makes it on the borderline of average so i would rate it at a 3. COBY, learn how to put lyrics in your song, rather than say nonsense repeatedly over and over and over in one song. you know what i mean."
4,"Impressive, but not perfect","This CD has enough good songs to make it well worth buying, but some of the songs, like ""Snakes"" and ""Infest"" are obviously filler songs. They are overshadowed, however, by the HUGELY impressive ""Last Resort"", the emotional ""Broken Home"", the heavy and relentless ""Dead Cell"", and the complex ""Revenge"" (You've gotta love the guitars in this one, folks.)Overall, This album is a big hit with me, except for the fact that some of the songs are obviously below what this artist is capable of performing."
3,They were better before they signed onto a major label,"I've heard of Papa Roach eversince they performed at clubs making a chicken feed amount of money. As a native Bay Arean I remembered their original music was more hardcore punk than alt/rap metal. When I lived in Berkeley they played a mile away from where I lived on Gilman Street, the legendary Canning Shop (which showcased such acts as Rancid, Suicidal Tendencies, and (ick) Green Day.) and the music sounded more like that scene.After the label, the production got steep and morphed mysteriously into pop-metal.Although the music here is not representative of their original tracks, kudos to the success. When you've been in a band for nearly 10 years, credit is owed where credit is due. Good work!"
1,Perhaps they'd like some cheese with that whine......,"My brother bought this cd and has played it in my car a few times and i've ome to realize that papa roach is one of the worst ""new wave"" ""rapcore"" bands come out lately. Their lyrics are contrived, cliche, and stereotypical for this type of music, and their guitarist is enbarrasingly bad. If you want teen angst go for a band with musical talent like stabbing westward, or nine inch nails, but this is one of the worst cookie-cutter albums i've seen engineered to be popular in a long time, at least since the Backstreet Boys latest effort."
5,This cd kicks major ass,This is one of the best CDs you can buy. This is the major label debut of a band that has kicked major ass in the independant scene for the last couple of years. It's great to see one of these independant bands get the recognition they deserve.
5,All Around Great Rock CD,"When you listen to a typical rock album, you usually come accross a few songs that are bad and don't fit with the album. Not this one, there is not one dissapointing song on the whole album. Every song is great and catchy. Last Resort is just an awesome song, and I can see why they are big because of it. The song is hard hitting and you will never get tired of it. In my opinion, the best song on the album is Broken Home. It is just an all around great song, along with the album."
2,man let me tell you this is great,"Way back when I was about to go to camp, id say last summer, me and my friend where watching MTV2 and we saw a video of a band called ""papa roach"". The video ""last resort"" was a great video but me and my friend still laughed at the name ""papa roach"". Well when we got back from camp they had ""infested"" they world with that very song. I decited to wait for another single to come out before I got the cd. When ""broken home"" came along I thought it was an awsome song so I went to the store and got the cdIt went all downhill from there............... :(I poped it in my player, and dont be fooled last resort and broken home ARE THE ONLY GOOD TRACKS. Then I learned that the riffs were taken from an Iron Madien song so that only left one track. Well after many tries of trying to find something good about it I sold it to my cousin and I have it no more. Dont let the same thing happen to you.................................."
1,can you say unoriginal?,"This is just another boring, redundant ""numetal/rapmetal"" band, tailor made for TRL."
4,better than the biskit,Not a bad album. Has a wicked fast flowing beginning and continues at this pace throughout. The singles taken from the album stand out as the best tracks on this album. The only let down is Broken Home which could not finish quick enough. All in all if you like Limp Biskit this album will please you. If you hate Limp Biskit this may surprise you.
3,"Rap metal, nu-metal, punk metal, whatever...","Papa Roach immediately fall under the same category as Limp Bizkit, Korn, and Linkin Park as to what is called ""trend metal"", meaning Papa Roach would be in near obscurity like other nu-metal acts such as Reveille, The Deadlights, and Primer 55 if not for appearing on MTV allowing the teenieboppers to buy ""Infest"" because they saw Papa Roach as a one hit wonder trend. ""Infest"" is a surprisingly half decent album, and they can do the rap/rock thing a lot better than Limp Bizkit or Korn ever could. My only gripe is that it seems the boys in Papa Roach try to shove too much aggression and disillusionment down your throat at once, which is a big turn off. And I have to somewhat aggree with Matthew Cerrato's review, those riffs are very reminiscent of Iron Maiden, which leads me to wonder how for real Papa Roach are."
2,A few good ones....The rest? Bland.,"I, like many others, heard 'Last Resort' and decided to get the cd. Big dissapointment. Sure the riffs sound a lot like Iron Maiden, (Mainly because the guitarest has classical influence like Iron Maiden) and the drumming and bass are a tad boring. But what I really hate is the lyrics. I don't know about you, but I'm getting a little sick of hearing the same old BS about some whiny kid. It's gotten so out of hand, it's hard to tell who's sincere and who's just faking to sell records. Anyways, My faves are.1.Dead Cell (Wish all the songs were like it but...) 2.Last Resort (Reeeeeaaaaaaaalllllyyyyyyyyy overplayed) 3.Between Angels And Insects (Their new *ahem* 'Hit' single) 4.InfestAs for the rest? Bland, boring, hampered by a medicore singer, and horrible lyrics.I know I'm not the only one. All my friends hated it too. [....]"
3,"good at first, but got old quick.","this cd could show more of papa roach's songwriting abilities. most of the songs sound the same, with the same lyrics over and over again. the two tracks that i though were the best were between insects and angles, and, cliche as it might be, last resort. this cds easy to follow songs were good at first but as you listen to the cd through you can easily see the songs are repetitive."
2,NoT thAt GoOD,"for papa roach this is there best cd but i dont see the hype over it. they do rip off alot of bands on this cd to try and sound metal. (korn, rage against the machine, green day). i like how they try to sound metal but deep inside they r punk. just buy gettnig away with murder and you'll know what i mean. they r a pretty decent band however and id prefer to listen to them other than limp bizkit. everyone claims how this is p.roachs best cd, but now that i think of it they don't have really ne good cds. so all in all i give this 2 stars for there effort on trying to sound like someone else."
4,Very Addictive,"As soon as you hear the first song on this album, you need to listen to the rest of the cd. I first got introduced to this band when I heard ""Last Resort"" on the radio, and the same day I went out and bought this CD. Its VERY good, and all of it comes from the artists souls."
3,More like 3 1/2 stars,"ill admit that this is far better than bizkit. the songs actually have meaning into it. but bizkit on the other hand sings about stupid stuff. By listening to this cd i could tell that i am now grateful for wat i have. and that i dont have to deal with divorce or people doing sucicide. but the bad thing about this band is that they really need to bring more mixes into there music. i no what ur thinking how could they get any more. here is what i say. get a dj in the band. seriously the formula is working for linkin park, and i to say bizkit but papa roach has some real talent like linkin park. and if they added a dj they would sound even hotter. so i hope that yall will buy this albulm. great to all. a buy the way dont listen to bizzzkits numba one fan yall. he doesnt no what he is talking about."
1,Infest,WE'RE PAPA ROACH!! WE'RE A BUNCH OF POSERS WHO WRITE SONGS THAT MEAN NOTHING TO US SO YOUNG CONFUSED TEENS CAN FEEL LIKE THEY RELATE AND BUY OUR ALBUM. IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE!!!=)
2,Not that good,"I bought this CD based on the recommendation of a few friends. Expecting at the very minimum a decent CD I was very disappointed. This CD offers nothing new to any fan of rap/metal. If this is what the record industry has to offer, shoot me. Songs 4 and 7 are decent but that is about it."
1,"Bad music, this is what we called bad music","One of the worst CD's existed.I have listened to hundreds of bands better than this PAPA ROACH (Stupidest band name). The vocal is terrible, lyrcis are downright childish, and the music, melody itself is unbearable. I guess this kind of crappy music ain't my taste."
2,this disc sounds artificial,"no offense to those who actually like them, but to me, an impartial listener who neither liked nor disliked the band before i bought INFEST, this band seems kind of fake. they seem to be cashing in on the trend of rebelling for no real reason, and encourage impressionable youngsters to play into their fake ""angst."" I mean, what's this singer's problem, anyway? What is he rebelling against? Making a lot of money? Getting played on MTV and being hounded by young women? It seems to me that this person is one of those types who tries to sell a product by trying to come off as ""deep"" and ""troubled."" Listening to his snotty vocals and fake word-emphasis ('saaahfachhation,' noooo breathing...) is really just annoying and I'd much rather listen to some other band do it who has a less transparent version of a ""message."""
1,-50,"nothing beats these guys.they just keep on [being sub-par].its amazing to me how so many people get fooled year in and year out with these fake trend based corporate contrived bands jamming the market,and noone bothers to think ""hey, mabye they ARE the new hair metal""!!.no.noone will.korn,limp bizkit,papa rocah,linkin park,crazy town,kid rock,(hed)p.e.,slipknot...etc, are the poison,guns n roses,ratt,warrent,winger etc, for this generation.its gonna be funny when in 5 years these jerks are out of style and everyones moved onto the next shallow trend,and they scramble to change their style while calling it ""evolving as a band"".that should be great.so, keep on buying this junk, and keep on being ""hip"", and keep these trends going."
1,Worst band ever!,"I gave it one star because I couldn't give it a zero. Do yourself a favor stop letting MTV dictate what you listen to, and this drivel will go away!"
1,not so Great debut!,the best thing about infest is jerry horton's guitar riff on that one song lastresort. the extras(videos and special tracks) are worth it at all the record isnt even worth buying really but you would be fine just buying the regular LP if u like the band.
2,Papa Roach dissapoints,"I bought this album after their 3rd single ""Between Angels And Insects"" came out.Since I liked all 3 of their singles,""Last Resort"",""Broken Home"" and ""Between Angel And Insects""I thought the album was worth buying.I thought they would have other good songs on the cd but that wasn't the case.I was really dissapointed.I think Papa Roach is an o.k. band and I love ""Last Resort"" and the other ones I mentioned,I just wish they had more better songs.So I rate this album below average."
2,ZZZ...,"I used to really like this CD but now it's just tired. The hidden track is far and away the best song, but even that isn't anything great. Avoid it. Get a Flaw, Ill Nino, or Tool CD instead, you'll thank me. Peace."
4,Papa Roach and How They Began,"Unfortunately, Papa Roach's first release does not captivate me as much as their later releases such as Getting Away With Murder and The Paramour Sessions. But it is better than Metamorphosis. There's a bunch of F bombs thrown everywhere, and even some strong uses of the S word, the D word, and other bad words. But other than that, it's pretty forgivable, because this album is great.Rating: 3.5 stars/5 stars"
2,"ok, when it was 2000","This album sounds too run down now.Songs that I liked then,now seemed too boring and uninspiring.At first,I thought it was ok but many songs never got to me.Many songs were quickly played out and many of the songs were simply bad.Download some songs or buy it if your still a fan of them but my advice is to skip it."
1,trash,"I bought this cd after hearing last resort and i hated it but tried to like cause it was the ""cool"" thing but i ended up selling it because i hated it. Broken Home is the best track."
3,2 good songs ten mediocere,"Aside From ""Last Resort"" and ""Broken Home"", this CD has a little too much angst for any one. They're lyrical value is high and the CD would be good if it wasn't so similiar, This CD pretty much has 3 songs that are just reused with different words. Hold out on this one and check out Blink 182 ""Dude Ranch"" for similiar musical taste without the repitition."
1,This music was better played by Iron Maiden.,"This outright ENRAGES me! Papa Roach [borrowed] many MANY riffs from Iron Maiden on this CD. Last Resort, for example, is a blatent steal from Iron Maiden's ""To Tame a Land"" off of their ""Piece of Mind"" album. I also noticed other lines stolen. ""Take my money, take my blah blah blah"" is the main riff from ""Prowler"" off of Maiden's self titled CD...."
3,Disappointed,"After listening to the song, ""Last Resort"", on the radio I became so incredibly hyped about this band that I went out and bought the cd immediately. As I was listening to the cd in my car on the way home, I felt the first twinge of regret. ""Last Resort"" and ""Between Angels and Insects"" are the only good tracks on this cd and totally--by themselves--not worth the $16.00 I paid for it at the store. However, I think it's only fair to say that the band has a wealth of potential and I (cautiously?) await any new releases that they might have in the future. But for now...I'll soon be making a trip to trade this cd in."
3,eh...,"I bought the CD after becomming obsessed w/ Broken Home and Last Resort. I'm totally in to rock and alternative music. The mixture of rap in p. roach's other songs kinda screw up the songs. I also think he goes a little overboard w/ the screaming. Other than the songs w/ huge amounts of rap and screaming, I think it's an a-okay CD. I regret not listening to the clips provided on amazon."
1,Who's Your Daddy?,"These guys got such a buzz going for themselves, but i don't see why. its rediculous how much they sound like any other new ""rap-metal"" band out there. thats all i have to say."
1,I Can't Stop Blah blah blah.............................,"I recently purchased this cd and found it to be awful in many ways, they seem to follow the recent trend of Limp Bikzit and all those other rapcore metal bands, their lyrics are poorly written and their guitarist lacks any talent that a good band should have. The lead singer has a ok scream but a scream doesn't make and sell a cd do in this case i give them 1 star just for the fact that thats the lowest you can rate them"
4,"yes, they're good.","To be honest, I'm really surprised how good they are. Well, they sound a bit like Limp Bizkit, Korn, but I like those bands too, so where's the problem? The best thing about their music is their feeling for melodies, which isn't so common nowadays. A for myself, I listen to music from bands like TOOL, The Cure, Korn, Type O'Negative (nice mixture, eh?) and Papa Roach fits perfectly into that list. So, if you're listening to the same stuff, don't hesitate and buy their CD."
4,Not your normal rapcore band...,"You may say that papa roach is trying to follow this ""rapcore"" fad that consists of bimp lizkit and korn, but that would be a false statememt. Songs like broken home, tight rope (bonus song), binge, blood brothers, and between angels and insects are real metal that mey be compared to staind and disturbed, even though a comparison to this CD would be inadequate, as this record is somewhat original. And by the way, Limp Bizkit and Korn are NOT rapcore so if you like them and love fads like that, then why are you looking at this CD? The only reason I give it 4 stars is that they didn't put Legacy, walking through barbed wire or dirty cut freak or many of their older songs on this CD, and they totally redid tight rope."
4,Listen in small doses,"The first time you hear this cd it sounds amazing. By the end of the week it grows a little tiresome. And in a month it can get very boring. Though, rap-metal fans will probably worship this album, others should buy it and only listen to it ounce in a while, not everyday. Papa Roach should be more respected since many of their songs are more deeper and powerful then limp bizket or kid rock. The hints of punk rock are also a nice touch. Rage Against the Machine fans will find some of the guitar sounds similiar. Overall this is a pretty solid album for a debut(though the lyrics need a little bit improvement). Rap-Metal fans get it now and other rockers won't be dissappointed, just need to listen to it occasionaly and not ware it out(like I did). Final Note: Serious Rap-Metal that can easily be called, ""the only rap metal cd you need."""
5,Beautiful ring for the price,I purchased this ring for my wife. The diamonds are of much better quality than I was expecting. There seem to be VERY LITTLE inclusions and the stones seem to be very near colorless. The way the stones are set make the ring look like more than 1 CTTW.I got a great deal for this ring on a Friday sale with free shipping and $25 off from Netaya.
3,She was there,"and she was a personal friend of Winston Churchill, booster of his career, constant well-wisher, messenger, whisperer of secrets, conduit, facilitator, socialite, grande dame, and political operator in her own right. But these reminiscences add little to Churchill's legend, beyond shared moments when events in the background carried her along. She needed heros like Winston & her father (also a prime minister). She seems not to have noticed that, when Winston was most down, she wasn't there for him. The book IS ""an intimate portrait,"" and it illuminates political and social life for British aristocrats in the early Twentieth Century; but I learned more from Lord Moran's biography and Churchill's own writings."
3,Not enough pieces,"I am a fan of the One Piece manga, which is good, because if I wasn't I'd have been *completely* lost during this film. It is a *GOOD* thing that Amazon.com notes in the title that this is the 8th movie created for One Piece *beyond* the numerous manga and anime TV episodes. Thus, this is *not* a good starting point to begin with this series.That being said, the characters remain both heartwarming and humorous. The emphasis on the friendship and loyalty among the protagonists maintains the sense of strong relationships among the characters. The fight scenes were a bit too drawn out, though given the medium and the source material, this is perhaps to be expected. It would have been nice, though, if a bit more exposition had been included as to who the characters were, though fans of the series should likely already know the backgrounds and motivations.I give this anime film 3 stars. If it had been a bit more friendly toward new viewers, I'd likely have given it 4."
1,Disturbing,I sat down with my two children and my sister to watch this movie. It was a very slow start and then got somewhat violent. I ran for the cover and check the rating. In the end we could not finish it - the final decision was it was 'not good' and 'disturbing'.
2,"recut footage from the ""Alabasta"" story arc","First off, I love One Piece. It is one of my favorite TV shows of all time. I own the DVDs for the first 330 episodes (Japanese version) and counting.However,as stated above ""One Piece: Movie 8 consists of recut footage from the ""Alabasta"" story arc of the TV series with some bits of additional animation.""They also recut it such that I don't think anyone not already familiar with the story could follow it. The Alabasta episodes (92-130)were pretty long so trying to fit thirty eight 20+ minute episodes in to a ""movie"" is quite a task. Still 4Kids or whomever did this completely butchered it.View the original Alabasta episodes, not this."
4,Awesome Movie,"I love the quality of this blu-ray release. The audio and video was great, allowing me to enjoy this movie. I would recommend people to watch this movie if they haven't yet. The only cons I found was no extra features such as behind the scenes or other extras."
2,Um...,"An anime about pirates in the desert? Sure, why not. 'One Piece Part 8' is an average piece of anime. It is nothing spectacular(its no 'Akira'). Its not ultra-violent and its not very funny. It really doesn't do anything extremely well. The animation is okay, the story is kinda goofy, etc.'One Piece' isn't really my cup of tea. I guess to my mature palette, stuff like this just doesn't stick out. It is average in every way. But, my 7-year old nephew loved it, so he now owns my copy."
2,So So,'One Piece - The Desert Princess and the Pirates: Adventures in Alabasta (Movie No. 8)' is a so so anime movie. I wasn't very drawn in by the movie and not very excited by it. I have seen better anime and this isn't tops in my book.**

2,Watches Like a Video Game,"Not coming from a background of Manga or Japanese anime, The Movie: One Piece - The Desert Princess, was my baptism into this interesting form of media.I wasn't totally disappointed with the movie, but I can't say it would be my first choice of entertainment.The action was fast and cut quickly from scene to scene. The characters were a little flat. (Although, I haven't had much experience with One Piece...) So, I'm sure looking back on earlier works would give some insight.I was very much reminded on many video role playing games I've experienced. The characters moved from place to place... Got into fights... And moved on...The story was mostly driven by revenge and the redemption of a people under ruthless tyranny. If you can wade through the shallow characterizations and manic action you might just find a glimmer of inspiration in the story-line."
2,Stupid and not worth your time,"This is the 8th installment of this story. It is the 1st one I have watched, and therein may lie the problem. I found myself lost in the story, not really understanding who was whom and what the heck was happening. The best part of the movie was the cross-dresser. He was hysterical. To me, anime is just a lot of cartoon characters running around making alot of noise but not much sense.Luffy and his crew are helping Princess Vivi try to save Alabasta, which is undergoing a civil war, caused by the evil Crocodile and his minions.Maybe the problem is that I entered this series in the middle instead of at the beginning, but from what I saw during my 90 minutes of hell, this is not something I would recommend to people I like."
3,A little too weird for my taste,"Okay, I will honestly admit that I've only seen the first couple of episodes of ""One Piece"", the anime series. I will also admit that this series just didn't have much appeal for me. So please take this into account while reading this review. I was hoping the movie would ""change my mind about the series""... I was wrong.This review however, isn't about the show itself but on the movie based upon the series called ""One Piece - The Desert Princess and the Pirates"". So, what did I think of this movie? Well, if I had to describe it in a word... it'd be the word ""cheesy"". It's overly dramatic and silly in every way... and kind of perverted too. It's also incredibly weird and complex. So, if that's what you like about the series, then you would probably enjoy this movie. Otherwise, I would advise you to seek a different anime movie to explore. You have been warned."
3,My 11 yr. old and 16 yr. old liked it a lot,"I received an advance copy of this movie for review. Unfortunately, it just wasn't up my alley. There is a lot of Japanese animation both my husband and I like and have watched, but this just didn't fit the bill for us.However, both my children really enjoyed this and had no real criticism even when asked. They said it was a bit hard to follow but they recognized that they had no prior knowledge of the series, except for what they've heard of it.They said it was ""average"". To me, average is three stars, so that's what I gave it since that's what they'd give it-- and I think it's geared to teenagers. Had I just been left viewing it, I would have had trouble even giving it an average rating."
1,Missing audio,"On the 2.0 Japanese audio track the characters voice tracks disappearStarting around 1:10:49 the voices for the following lines disappear:""This is so stupid.""""What are you standing around for?!""Go kick or punch or something!""""just stop the rebellion!""Crocodile:""The scopion venom is definitely working!""I doubt it is just my disc and it is probably a production problem. Buyer beware."
3,"""This Isn't Good, I Can't Hit Him At All..... He's Too Sandy!""","I have to admit I am an anime novice and my previous exposure to the genre consisted of more mainstream hits like SPIRITED AWAY, HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE and a few episodes of Dragon Ball Z. However as a mom and high school teacher I know there are a lot of hard core anime fans out there especially in the under thirty set so I was curious to watch this movie from the ONE PIECE series. Like most anime the storyline is complicated and the visuals are innovative and complex. Unfortunately the dialogue does not always seem to translate well from Japanese and we get stilted/corny phrases like ""He embodies the word fiend like no one else I ever met."" or the quote from the movie I chose for the title of my review. Did this movie convert a middle aged woman to an anime enthusiast? No, but my twelve year old son did enjoy the film and is interested in watching more ONE PIECE."
2,"Sorry, Not for me","Perhaps I'm too old to enjoy this. Personally, I didn't like it. I guess this is aimed for the teenage-young adult population. The animation was good."
3,A gift for my husband...,And he loved it! Perfect size to fit anywhere and he loves the Jets so that helped!
1,Poor guality,I am sorry to say that my experience with the satin pillow case was disapointing.Before I even washed it I disgarded it due to the fact that one seem pulled apart.
3,over rated,"QOTSA first album was perfect, this one is good but lacks something... There are bright spots, like ""feel good hit of the summer"", but the production bugged me. It's still good, and should get 3.5 stars, but I don't know, it just doesn't have that certain specialness QOTSA's other releases have. Like they didn't try as hard with this one or something. That's just me, lots of people LOVE this release. I can take it or leave it."
2,I don't get it....,Everytime I listen to this it reminds me of 80's new wave...like flock of seagulls or something or that techno rock. This is pretty far removed from stoner rock. On its own without any preconceived notions its probably OK but not what I expected.
3,Their Most Pop-Like,"This one seems to be the most calculated of the QOTSA cds, as well their most ""small sounding"" effort. There's alot of hooks and melodies, and instead of pumping and grinding, the music moves at a nice mid-tempo. Stoner influences have been replaced by glam rock, as J. Homme delivers a T-Rexish vocal performance, which suits his limited range. It's interesting, but not on par with the epic SFTD."
2,Why does everybody like this album?,"The first album was so good, but this one doesn't even compare. If it wasn't QOTSA, I'd toss it in the trash. I figure maybe the more I listen to it, the less I'll hate it. If you don't have the first album, definitely get it instead. If you have to have ""R"", go to any record store. They'll have about 20 copies they're selling for 5 bucks because nobody wants it."
2,QOTSA had better thank the gods of rock for LANEGAN,"This cd is bad folks. It has two bright spots, both are songs that have Mark Lanegan on vocals. Another song he sings on, not even he could save. I really enjoy the song Into the FADE, but as for the rest of the cd, the only cd I have bought that I liked less was MONSTER by REM. The only thing that made that worse, was the band is so good, that the expectations were higher for REM. Queens of the Stone Age have recruited Mark Lanegan as a contributing force, and I will buy the cd to hear his voice, but as big of a fan as I am, if it's as bad as RATED R, I will be back here and trying to keep you from buying it too! Buy his solo cds, and his CDs with Screaming Trees, but stay away from Rated R. Into the Fade is not worth the 12 dollars the cd will cost you. As always, be well people, and listen to music that fills your soul, not this which fills your toilet!"
2,THIS ALBUM DID NOTHING FOR ME.,I bought this album expecting some quality tunes but was unfortunatly let down. I heard the song 'Feel Good Hit of the Summer' and thought that it had some quality to it. When I listened to the album in it's entirety it just kinda bored me and left me wanting more. I hope future stoner-rock bands don't follow in the Queens of the Stone Age's footsteps cause if they do there's gonna be a dark dark future...
4,Not to be taken seriously...,"This band loves rock and roll. They will open you up and let themselves inside. I can prove it.Infectious, unafraid to employ any conceivable sound, unwillingly in defiance of any musical construct, Queens of the Stone Age is a constantly evolving group of mutually respectful musicians who at the core are two of the most humble souls rock and roll has ever known.That being said, listen straight through to ""R"". The lattice of Kyuss remains, as the origins of any great band should, and, now a few years growns, I still listen."
2,Very disappointing,"Ok, i know that Kyuss is no more, and I don't really even expect Josh and Nick to carry on in that direction. And I did quite like the first QOTSA album. But I just don't understand what all the fuss is about this album. To me it sounds like lots of half-baked ideas and an overall pretty generic guitar rock album. I bought an advance promo of this used on the recommendations of reviews and hype, and sat back waiting to be blown away. I was not! I've given it a few listens now, and there are 3 or 4 good songs on it, but nothing memorable that would draw you in again and again. And i'm sorry ""Monsters in Your Parasol"" is just a terrible song. Bummer..."
4,Not What I Expected,"This CD is not very much stoner rock, barely at all. That doesn't make it bad, it is just different for Queens of the Stone Age. They still have their typical up and down faster riffs, and Josh Homme's great vocals, but otherwise, it recalls bands like Screaming Trees. This CD seems to be to me the missing link between grunge and stoner rock, because it is way faster than any stoner music I have ever heard, but way more fuzzy than any grunge I've heard. The drums are still very good as well as the guitars, and this CD proved Queens of the Stone Age as some of the most talented stoner rock I have ever listened to. My two favorite songs are Leg of Lamb and In the Fade. For fans of Screaming Trees and Mudhoney."
5,"Rated R, R for Righteous!","I own all of QOTSA'S albums and I have to say this my favorite one. If you haven't heard the songs from this album. You'll go crazy for such catchy tracks as ""feel good hit of the summer"" which doesn't have the best lyrics but it does have some of the catchiest (CaCaCaCocaine!!!) on the album combined with simple but groovy guitars this song proves to be one of the best songs on the album. The album doesn't lose steam and continues with ""The Lost Art Of Keeping A Secret"". ""Leg Of Lamb"", ""Better Living Through Chemistry"", ""In The Fade"", and contrary to the name ""Lightning Song"" slightly slower tracks but all of them are full of intensity, powerful licks and lyrics. For those who like the heavier stuff check out ""Tension Head"". All in all this album is full of great songs and variety. A righteous CD that is must have for everyone."
2,you can do better,I selected this hastily one day thinking it was a&c's old 'sitcom' tv show. It is a collection of very old variety show episodes. a&c are never bad but watch everything else first. Highly recommend their 4-box set of movies. Excellent quality and a good value at around $15 per volume.
3,Forced to Read,I was forced to choose a book off the 100 Best Sellers and with the project being due in 4 days I went w/ the book with the least pages! Imagine that:)Any ways I got through the book and found that unless I want to read a book about two lovers who should not be together no matter how bad their partners are or her partner is I need to be in a romantic mood. So I can feel some kind of compassion for them when they are trying to kill an innocent man (no matter how dirty or greasy he is.)
2,many version of retold incident,"This is th... story of ""... incident ""... ...... - are --... @""D@@Frank tells the police that Cora did it.@It was Frank that actually killed the husband although Cora has some involvement in the murder. whether to count Cora for the murderer or not is the point to be discussed in the reader.. Finally, Cora an Frank are happily spending at the beach, swimming. Cora dies there. Th... police investigates whether it "" natural death or not.Another theme of this novel is love. Love is a strong emotion.. When it is worked in the wrong way it is dangerous.@This book also tells about the vainness and vulnarability of love."
3,Not What I Was Expecting,"This is definitely not a book that suited me. I like the concept of noir, but did not love Cain's style of writing, nor did I actually fall for the story. Those who love this genre may find it to be a lot better, but all in all, the story was jumpy, the language hard to read at times and more than a bit unbelievable.Service, however, was excellent. Received it the next day."
4,Morality Play,"A very good book, that for the most part has stood the test of time well. Some excellent twists, about people who you get the feeling might have turned out differently if the circumstances of their lives had been different. Short enough for anyone to take a chance on, and most will probably enjoy the time spent."
4,Full of Despair,"This slim novel was first publishedin 1934, it felt timeless to me and was finished in one sitting without pause. The lead characters Frank and Cora are bleak and cold, totally lacking in redeeming qualities. What makes the book so gripping to me is that the style of the writing, the sparse use of words and it's coldness exactly matches them.The content is not suitable for young children and at one time Cain faced prosecution for this publication. Today as the world has changed Postman would not have had the same impact in those terms, but as a literary work I think it is still stunning.The plot is the murder of a small time diner owner by his wife and her drifter lover who comes to work for them and the destruction of what affection they had for each other through their own amoral natures.Excellent!"
1,Pathetic....,"This CD is pathetic beyond words. Rod's ""whiskey tinged"" voice is not at all suited for this style of music.....you'll need several whiskies just to get through this CD a second time. The music accompanying Rod was much better than his singing. I actually felt embarrassed for him at some points. Just glad I borrowed it before I bought it. Now I can use the money I saved to buy a CD by a performer who knows how to sing these songs!"
2,"Great songs, but not the right voice for them!","Being someone who grew up through rock, disco, R&B;, etc., I have always been madly in love with the great American standards from the past; however, these great songs require the kind of vocal prowess needed to truly interpret them (think of Frank Sinatra, Johnny Mathis, Doris Day, Jo Stafford, Vic Damone, Perry Como, Steve and Eydie, and so on).Unfortunately, there are singers who should stay far away from this material. The song selection and arrangements on this CD are fine, but Rod Stewart's somewhat raspy voice does not do these songs the kind of justice they deserve."
1,Rod Stewart is not Sting!!!!,"After listening to a few tracks at a big chain bookstore I wanted to tell the staff to please take this garbage off the shelves. Rod Stewart is not Sting. He does not have the tone, phrasing, or style to pull off these beautiful standards. If you want to hear a pop icon singing great standards check out the soundtrack to ""Leaving Las Vegas"" with Sting and Don Henley."
1,This CD is something that will be forgotten very quickly -,"During the course of the eightees and nineties, Rod Stewart somehow became the entertainer/pop star who kept making a lot of money by pandering to baby boomers who are so gullible, they'll buy anything.This CD is nothing more than an attempt to revive a waning career. Since the members of his earlier audience are a lot less interested in hearing Stewart warble pop tunes, some A&R guy apparently decided the same audience could be milked in a different way.The only problem is, Stewart has no vocal presence. The only thing I'd be able to compare this CD to is if someone got hold of a digital copy of ""Casablanca"" and morphed Pauly Shore into Humphrey Bogart's persona.It's not that I don't like Pauly Shore; It's just that Pauly Shore standing in for Bogart would be too much of a stretch. Using Stewart to sing these standards is way too much of a stretch.Some things are better left alone. This CD is a very good example of that."
5,Marvelous listening for relaxation,I love this CD and the second one he produced. Put it on the computer and it is great listening while working. Hope Rod makes a few more of this format cause they are my very favorites of all in my collection.
2,Rod Stewart is a guy?!!,"I grew up in the forties, and heard a lot of big band music, but I never heard of Rod Stewart. So one day I hear ""Just the way you look"" on this commercial on TV. It sounds like Annette Palmer, this girl I used to know who liked to sing in one of the lounges I used to go to. But the wife tells me this is someone named Rod Stewart. I go to Best Buy and start looking through female vocalists. After an hour, I'm getting nowhere, so I ask the clerk about a female jazz singer by the name of 'Rod Stewart' and he takes me over to where all the CD's are. Rod Stewart turns out to be some guy! What do you know about that?"
1,Heaven Help Us!,"One of the reviewers said ""It's said that Stewart has been vocalizing many of these songs in private for years"". My response? ""Why, oh why did he have to go public!""This is as big a load of garbage as I have ever heard. It qualifies for the ""World's Worst Music"" website. Yuck!"
1,just too phoney,If you want to hear these songs try real singers like Bennett and Sinatra. Come on! What would critics say if Tony Bennett's new CD had Maggie May or Hot Legs on it? These American Songbook cds by Rod are sold knowing middle aged yuppie woman will buy them.
1,"100% pure, unadulterated garbage. 0 stars actually","I cannot understand why a Popular artist would attempt to make such a difficult transformation.Crooning is an art which requires both a quality voice and the ability to hold a note. Our boy, slick, here has neither.BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK."
1,It had to be dreadful,"You know those ""pop"" albums that opera singers occasionally make the mistake of recording? The ones where their voice and interpretations are so mis-matched to the material the the result is painful to listen to? This is in the same category.Stewart has a great rock voice and it is totally misapplied here. His efforts to sound sweet come off as syrupy. Each track sounds more bland than the next. Although the blurb in the liner notes claims Stewart has been singing these songs for years, it sounds like he never heard them before. He brings nothing, but nothing to these songs.Old rock stars should fade away, not foist albums like this on an unsuspecting public."
5,PLEASANTLY SURPRISED,"After all the hype, I couldn't wait to get this CD. It arrived this morning, I immediately played it and after listening to the first three tracks remarked to my husband ""It's sweet...but he seems a little uncomfortable singing the standards"". Guess I didn't give it a chance because after a second listen to the entire CD, I fell in love. I've been playing ""Songbook"" all day and love it more each time it plays. Rod Stewart's interpretation of these great standards is genuine, soulful Stewart. The orchestration is lush but subtle and Rod is out there, front and center, that oh so familiar rasp performing a genre of music we've never heard from him before, and doing it beautifully. I highly recommend this CD to everyone, not just Stewart fans. You'll be pleasantly surprised. I predict GRAMMY NOMINATION!"
1,Terrible ! Great songs - terrible voice,"These are the greatest songs ever written. They're good arrangements, with a good (not great) orchestra behind him. But his voice is terrible - Rough, hoarse. When all is said and done, it's still Rod Stewart! What was anyone thinking? Why did anyone ever buy this CD?I wrote this in 2004. Since then I changed my mind. I love these CDs. I have all 4. I was mistaken. I apologize!"
2,Only if you love Rod Stewarts voice!,I never did really love his voice but I thought...I love the oldies so maybe he would sound better with this style. Not so. I didn't care for it at all....to each his own!
5,A pleasant surprise,"I received this CD as a gift for Christmas and was not very excited about it until I popped it into my CD player on the way to work. I was stunned...how unlike Rod Stewart. It is just extrodianary and I play it often. Mr. Stewart's ""unique"" voice adds a dimension to these beautiful classics that can only be applauded. No, his voice is not ""Frank Sinatra or Tony Bennett"", but that is what makes this CD and the songs stand-out...it's a classic; don't miss it."
5,Just wonderful,"This new c.d. by Rod Stewart is just wonderful. It makes me believe in love again. I close my eyes, listen and see myself in the arms of my love dancing mindlessly across the floor, doing steps that can only be done in my imagination. It is just wonderful."
1,It Had To Be You... who'd ruin the Great American songbook,"The Great American Songbook. Yeah, right.You mean, ""The Great American Farcebook"", Mr. Stewart? So after years of singing rock trash, you turn back to the great body of songs that were recorded by the great ones before you, and you think you can do just as good a job as they did? WRONG, Mr. Stewart. And so are those musical morons who exclaim, ""awesome!"", ""smooth"", ""way to go"".I say to you, stuff it! Geez, go back to school and finish your Music 101, you bunch of imbeciles! You are all beyond musical redemption.And so are you, Rod Stewart. To hell with you!"
4,"Not Sinatra or Bennett, but...he is Rod Stewart","Gravelly voiced, intimate, and suggestive - that is what you get with Rod Stewart on this album of classics. He is good at what he does, unique in his own way. He sings to you and entices you. Great album as background for a quiet dinner for two in front of a fire, with a glass of red wine."
3,A noble effort that falls short,"Some will have you believe this is the worst album ever, while others will say it's the greatest thing he's ever done. The truth is, as always, its somewhere in the middle. Rod is not entirely comfortable with all these songs and sometimes the results are less than stellar. (He actually sings most of these songs better live). However, ""These Foolish Things,"" ""That's All,"" ""They Can't Take That Away"" are all terrific. It should be noted here that in no uncertain terms do we need a sequel to this CD. Get back to where you once belong, Rod."
5,It had to be you,"I fell in love with this voice, the first time I heard it, almost 40 years ago. It has actually matured, and become richer over the years. Rods strongest talent, has always been, the emotion he puts into his singing. I always felt that he was one of the greatest, but underappreciated ,singers of his generation. Rod Stewart demonstrates that he is a superb musical interperter, his timing, and phrasing are par to none. The songs will calm you, bring a amile to your face, and a tear to your eye. It gets better, each time you listen to it. You can't go wrong with this one."
3,On the fence...sort of,"Almost everyone seems to either love or hate this CD. You could say I'm in neither camp -- it's not the worst thing I've ever heard, but I wouldn't take it to a desert island either. It just doesn't compare to versions of the same songs by Sinatra, Nat ""King"" Cole, or Ella, but then again none of them could have sung some of Rod's best work. My biggest complaint is that pretty much all of the songs have the same feel and the same tempo. It would've been nice to hear a few faster ones. It really isn't all that bad, though; Rod has always proven my point that having a pretty voice doesn't equal a great singer. You can easily have one and not the other. A good, but not great, CD."
5,Irresistable!!!,When my wife put this CD on - I wasn't enthusiastic at all; I was never a fan of Rod's. Neither was she. This particular CD blew us both away & we couldn't be more devoted to Rod than his established fan club! We'd forgotten the wonder & mystery of dancing with each other & now we're doing just that & loving every minute! This CD isn't just a glint or sparkle of romance - it 's a 5-alarm fire no one wants to put out!!
1,You've gotta be kidding!,"This Rod Stewart album was a joke to begin with. I remember the first time I heard him on the radio and TV commercials doing remakes like These Foolish Things or The Way You Look Tonight, and I'm sitting at home going, ""What the..."" Anyway you look at it, it's still Rod Stewart, and still going to be Rod Stewart. His voice is too raspy and rough to do stuff like this. The man's got no soul into his music. Where's Stachmo or Ol' Blue Eyes when you need them the most? If you want a Great American Songbook, listen to them. Forget this album! You call this the Great American Songbook? I don't think so!"
4,Torch Songs Revisited,"I simply loved this CD. Having gown up listening to Ella and Sinatra, I'm always on the lookout for new versions of the smokey, back bar ballads that remind me of dinners and evenings at home with my family. Dad was a great jazz buff and greatly influenced my music. Rod has met the requirement. His voice is smokey and reminencent of a crooner that has lived life to the fullest. The lack of over ochestration lets his voice come thru clear and with all it's softer Rod Stewart style. I highly recommend the CD to all Stewart fans who want to relax at the end of the week with a martini."
5,Rod Stewart,"It's Rod, Rod Stewart, of course this is going to knock it out of the park and be a great listen"
4,frankly...,"if you're a young person (and by that i mean under 60 or so), and you're hearing these songs for the first time ... and you like them ... congratulations, you have excellent taste in music ... and this is certainly an enjoyable album ... but do yourself a favor, get yourself a frank sinatra record to hear how they're really done. (""nice 'n easy"" would be a good choice, since it has a lot of the same songs.)"
5,MUSIC TO MY OLD EARS,Finally! Every aspect of Rod Stewarts 'IT HAD TO YOU' album is scrumptious! What memories it conjurs up! Especially if you are 65 something! So sweet! Thanks Rod!
4,Nice touch Rod,"I have followed Rod's career since the early faces, and although he has had some classic all time songs, he has had his fair share of elevator nonsense, this fine collection of songs shows the listener what a real professional vocalist can do with a well written song.Nice departure for Mr. Stewartgreat mood music.Sing it again Rod."
2,Once is enough,"I'm glad I listened to this series on Napster-to-go before committing any money. I LOVE the American standards, performed by almost anybody who ""gets"" it. Rosemary Clooney, Wesla Whitfield, Bette Midler, Michael Feinstein, etc. Rod doesn't ""get"" it. All of the songs sound the same, they're all the same tempo, and his distinctive voice is simply unsuited to the genre and distracts from the simple beauty of the songs. The only thing that I can hope (and the reason it got 2 stars instead of 1) is that his name recognition will introduce new listeners to these classics."
1,ISULTING TO JAZZ AND THE SINGERS THAT PIONEERED THIS MUSIC,"As I said above an insult to such great singers of this music....Go listen to the real singers such as Tony Bennett, Ella, Sarah, Carmen, Mark Murphy and the likes..Just another get Rod richer release, its like eating fast food no substance...."
1,Lord help me !!,"Ok .. There comes a time when you have to say enough is enough. Its time. This is great music if I am in an elevator on the way to the 40th floor. But to actually sit and listen too it, is nauseating. I am not a big Stewart fan and haven't listened to his stuff in years. When a friend tried to force this down my throat I almost barfed. His music is tired, his vocals are boring and quite frankly the album just sucks. You would have to be a real Stewart fan to like this CD... or in a coma. I can't wait until his greatest hits come out with repetitious boring elevator music he has produced in the last decade. Isn't that what old washed-up artists do when they have totally lost their creativity?"
2,The Downward Spiral Continues,"I loved Rod Stewart with Jeff Beck, I loved Rod Stewart with the Faces, and I loved the first decade or so of Rod Stewart's solo career.I love most of the songs on this LP, and I love the genre from which they were plucked.But this CD, like so much of what Rod Stewart has recorded over the past 15-20 years, is dissapointing to say the least. The man lost the edge to his voice before most of his new fans were even born, and has been sloffing from style to style since Reagan was President in search of something to call his own.Despite the wildly optimistic comments of some reviewers, Stewart does not do a particularly good rendition of a single song on this CD. To be perfectly blunt, IT HAD TO BE YOU sounds like nothing so much as your neighborhood party animal waxing sentimental on Karaoke night at the strip-mall pub.Nobody would like to see another great record from Rod Stewart more than I would but, much as I hate to say it, this (once again) is not it."
5,Wonderful,I enjoy this cd more everytime I listen to it. It is so laid back. It is the best of two worlds for this granny!!...
4,Great Classics!,"One can hardly lose with such classic material as the songs on this CD. Rod's raspy (almost Satchmo-type voice) lends a special intimate quality to the performance. However, I never realized that he had a problem with the ennunciation of the ""th"" sound. He pronounces the word ""thrill"" correctly in the first song but in all the others he pronounces ""trill"" for ""thrill"", ""tree"" for the word ""three"" etc. Once you get over this annoyance and learn to accept it the CD is great! I like the fact that all the songs are mellow and fit if you are in a calm or romantic mood."
4,Can't Stop Listening!,I am hooked! This CD is just simply refreshing -- destined to be a classic. We can't stop dancing either!
2,"Very Bad, But 2 Stars ForTrying...........","If there's any doubt that rock singers cannot sing the great timeless tunes from the 1920's- 1950's, this CD will erase it. To say that this CD makes a mess of the ""Great American Songbook"" would be overly kind. Not that Rod ever could sing, but this album is mainly a rather ridiculous joke. Walk into any piano bar in the country, and you'll probably hear much better renditions of these timeless tunes, by some great local performers. Comparing this to Frank, Ella, Nat, Tony,etc. or even current performers like Diana Krall or Harry Connick is ridiculous, to say the least. The only elder statesman big name male pop/folk singer (who I've heard) who does any justice to these tunes is Willie Nelson, though there are a few aging ex-rocker ladies who do a good job...This album is the definitive proof that bad rock, and bad rock singers, simply cannot touch the greats of yesteryear!"
5,Possibly THE Greatest American Artist Ever,"Has anyone been as innovative and intelligent about the music they produce then Rod Stewart throughout his career. From the explosive originality of ""If you want my Body"" to the absolutely brillant American Song Book Rod Stewart proves again why he is the Quintessential American artist. Without his influences on generations of arists around the world would music be as good as it has become? I can't recomend this album enough. . . BUY IT RIGHT NOW! Waiting is only wasting precious moments of listening time."
1,terrible,This is the WORST C.D. EVER. tHE GUY CAN`T sing. Frank must be turning over in his grave. Try Frankie Randall`s C.D. THEN AND NOW.
1,Great American Songbooks should be sung by great singers,"and Stewart isn't one of them. His voice worked with the disco, pop-rock songs of the 70s and 80s but he just doesn't have the kind of voice, style, or interpretive ability to make these songs work. It hurts my ears to listen to him butcher these songs."
1,very weak,His Voice doesn't fit doing this type of material.as somebody else mentioned CLive Davis&Crew are trying too get a Barry Manilow Comeback type thing here.Rod doesn't have the Voice too carry the songs as Barry Manilow did when He did His take on Sinatra&other Covers.
3,It Had To Be You - Rod Stewart,"It didn't have to be at all, Rod! With a voice totally unsuitable for these lovely songs, Rod should not have bothered especially as the arrangements all sound so 'canned'to add to the misery! Chet Baker could get away with his voice, he felt the song and the lyrics. Rod Stewart sounds as if he wanted to try and squeeze just a few more bucks out us regardless of quality given. Stay with the ageing rocker image and don't try to be something you cannot be. Retire gracefully."
5,The BEST Love Songs Done By The Best Artist!,"I met my now fiance in Sept 2002. The next Month Rod's ""Great American Songbook I"" came out. I bought us both a copy and it instantly became ""Our CD"" The music from this CD has taken us though many happy, romantic, and bumpy times.. even the death of my Mom who loved many of these songs from her past. We both Plan to have our first dance as man and wife to ""Just the way you look tonight"" played from the CD. I also just got us both Volume II. These CD's are worth more than gold! I wish I could tell Rod Stewart THANK YOU in person! I can't believe the folks that gave Rod poor reviews! This CD went DOUBLE PLATINUM! That in itself tells you what a GREAT CD this is. I Can't wait for Volume III! I just hope Rod will sing ""Fly Me To The Moon"" for my sweetie. The music lives on in our hearts and always will.Kelly & soon to be Debbie Council"
1,Horrible. Simply horrible.,"Rod Stewart does not have the vocal ability to sing these types of songs. His voice is too raspy and rock-and-roll to properly capture their grace and beauty. I respect Stewart as a pop singer, but if you have any sense of respect for the past greats who have truly done justice to the classics, avoid this album like the plague."
2,I echo the sentiments regarding Rod's faltering voice.,"Rod Stewart shouldn't do an album like this. Though many stars can cross over from the sound that made their name, Rod isn't one of them. And this album of pop and jazz standards just comes off as an oddity, more curious than good.He should be singing ""Downtown Train"" or ""Infatuation,"" not songs better suited to Harry Connick, Jr. or Frank Sinatra. I know that, since his surgery, his voice isn't quite as capable of the power it used to contain, but these songs are hard to do well - and Rod's efforts, though noble, do neither he nor the music on this album the justice they deserve.There are some high points, but he's not able to sustain long notes on most of the songs, which harms the tempo as well as the tone."
3,Enjoyable But Pales Next To The Originals,"Taken on it's own this album is surprisingly enjoyable and far from embarrassing. (What's best about it is that we're spared the visuals of Rod camping it up in front of the orchestra per the A&E special). But in the end, the best singers of these classic tunes respect the material and pay homage to the writers via their interpretations. My guess is Rod has neither the patience or the inclination to delve much deeper into this genre. Stewart IS to be commended if this album encourages his rock fans to explore this genre further in greater depth. Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Ella and Nat Cole are waiting for you."
3,Nice But ...,"The arrangements are a little heavy on the orchestra's bass and cymbals. A little too raspy if you get my drift. These standards have been done so much better by so many others that one can hardly rate this greater than 3 stars. For instance get the soundtrack from Woodie Alan's ""RADIO DAYS"" to hear ""that Old Feeling"" or Dean Martin's version of ""It had to be You"" to see what a difference these songs can sound like. This CD does have a fantastic arrangement of ""These Foolish Things"" however. That being said, buy this CD..it is an interesting work by Rod who obviuosly loves this venue...Great dinner and date music..and cool in its own novel way."
5,"BRAVO, ROD STEWART!","What a magnificent CD! Rod Stewart certainly has captured the flavor of ""Fred and Ginger."" I am not a ""rocker"" fan. It was quite by accident that I came across this CD. The album's title is what attracted me and after listening to a few samples, I decided to take a chance and order a copy. Well, ever since I received this CD about three weeks ago, I have been hooked on listening to it every day. In fact, I even ordered two additional copies to use as birthday gifts. Would love to see Rod Stewart do a songbook devoted especially to one composer such as Cole Porter or maybe Rodgers & Hart. Look forward to hearing more great standards sung by Rod Stewart. ""It Had To Be You--The Great American Songbook"" is a wonderful addition to my music collection. Thanks, Rod Stewart, for sending it our way."
1,NOT STEWARTS BEST,"This cd is horrible. Rod Stewart should not be singing this type of song, he's more of a rocker not a romancer. He can't pull any of them off. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Is He Trying To Be Manilow?,"After listening to this album, I have to wonder a couple of things. First of all, is Rod Stewart trying to be Barry Manilow on this CD and what was Clive Davis thinking? The songs on this CD are classic, but Stewart's voice just isn't right for these songs. In addition, some of the songs on this new Stewart CD were previously recorded by many other artists (including Barry Manilow on his {""Showstoppers"" CD"") while Manilow was with Arista. It seems that Mr. Davis is now trying to turn Mr. Stewart into J Records ""Barry Manilow"", especially by using Dave Koz (who appeared on Manilow's ""Here At The Mayflower"" CD) last year. Perhaps Mr. Davis needs some original ideas these days!"
1,"Right Songs, Wrong Voice!","I admit I bought this album mostly out of curiousity because I am a big fan of the great standards on this album. However, I have enjoyed many of Rod Stewart's albums and songs over the years, and I wanted to hear how Rod sounded singing these songs. The songs on this album are classic songs written by some of America's best composers. However, I was very disappointed after listening to this CD because Rod's voice just doesn't compliment these songs at all! The songs on this CD demand a voice that is strong, clear and soothing. Unfortunately, Rod's coarse voice just doesn't work with these songs. My advice is don't waste your money or your time on this CD!"
1,Leave the crooning to Tony Bennett,"Rod Stewart goes Harry Connick Jr. on a set of big band standards from the 40's and 50's. What's next, Rod Stewart sings a tribute to Andrew Lloyd Webber? An album of duets with Andrea Bocelli? A man once so self-conscious about his voice he stood with his back to the audience now feels compelled to lend his unique vocal stylings to the ""Great American Songbook""? The world needs another version of ""They Can't Take That Away From Me"" like Michael Jackson needs another nose job. Congratulations, Rod, you are officially irrelevant."
2,Right Idea Wrong Artist,"The tragedy of this magnificent compliation is that it is so corrupted by Rod Stewart's poor voice....a man who sings like he's garggling aquarium rocks...he butchers some of America's finest song standards, and regretably, for many this will be their only exposure to this wonderful library of American romance through music.Each generation , it seems, pays homage to this genre...in fact many consider Willie Nelson's ""Stardust"" his finest effort musically..and while I find Nelson's nasally voice barely acceptable, it has a certain ""out-on-the-range "" masculine appeal.Stewart's raspy voice is God-awful. Its been 220+ years since we fought the British, but I think i am ready to pick up a sword and pick up where Washington left off."
2,For those over 80 and deaf,"When you are past your prime and off the charts the way in is to go back and sing the tunes of yesteryear. Brian Ferry, Barry Manilow, George Michael, Diana Ross et al.... This was far and away the worst effort of the bunch. It is clear that Rod has difficulty with the vocal range needed and is off key throughout. Maybe this is rum boogie for 80 year olds, but I can't imagine they could favor these renditions over the classic versions they were raised on."
1,"""[Stuff]"" comes to mind.","Firstly, I have been a fan of Rod Stewart for many years and have supported him even when his albums didn't sell at all.I have seen him in concerts as many times as I can, hey, I love the guy. He was even married at one stage to a fellow ""kiwi"", so he can't be all that bad.However,...... I got half way through this album, stopped it and threw it in the bin. Sorry Rod, it just didn't do it for me.... at all.Bring on your next album, but not this stuff."
3,Great American Song Book,"Well, the first disk in the set of four was a little dissapointing, not bad, just not ""WOW"". If I had heard that one first, I probably would not have bought the rest. BUT... I heard the third one first, and the second, third and fourth are Great....."
5,"Rod Stewart, Crooner","Wonderful! If you ever danced to or just listened to these songs way back then, you will love the new Rod Stewart singing about romance."
4,Rod at his most romantic.,"If you love Stewart, or love the standards, or both, get this CD. The songs are great, the arrangements are lush, and Rod sings them like Astaire danced--smooth and easy. If you're looking for great range and over-the-top vocalizing, this isn't for you. If you want to slide into a bubble bath with a glass of wine, sing along and just feel the romance, this is the one."
2,Lame,"Dying artists of the 80's ballad era, in search of a few quick dollars and a last grasp at fame should not be allowed to damage beautiful old classics. Rod never wrote his own material, and now that his buddies in the 80's saw the end and threw in the towel- refusing to write new material he has had to ""go jazz"". Not only is it embarrassing to him, and those who actually think this over singing, raspy voice of the 80's has talent, but his ""remake"" of these songs slapped together with what sounds like a high school jazz band as a background prevents singers with actual talent (Michael Buble etc.) from recording these songs. Rod- the ballad eras over, do us all a favour,toss in the towel, you've managed to run away with enough money, give up. please."
2,Bubble gum jazz,"No doubt about it, Rod Stewart has a sexy voice. However it takes more than just a voice to make jazz, he lacks heart and soul on these songs made worse by the musical accompaniments that sound like they're taken straight off a karaoke track.A great selection of songs, but to hear how they're supposed to sound listen to Billie Holiday, Chet Baker, Anita O'Day, and others."
3,"Not a barnburner, but some pretty tunes here","The first two selections, and I was ready to bail. I didn't think Rod's voice was suited to these post-WWII love ballads nor the ornate arrangements and flowery orchestrations...but by song #3(the touching ""The Way You Look Tonight"")I changed my mind slightly, and the last several selections won me over. ""For All We Know"" has been covered by every vocal performer, but Rod gives it a renewed sense of hopeful longing, and he also does very well with the closing song, ""That's All"", which is simple and yet shiveringly romantic. It took a few minutes for me to get used to hearing Stewart in this context, but once I was off the dime, it was quite captivating to hear him as a crooner. He does better than Robbie Williams, anyway. 'B'"
5,Very well done--I love it!,"I never imagined Rod Stewart singing this type of music. I didn't know what to expect. Other artists have also done old standards after having hits in a Pop genre--Natalie Cole, Melissa Manchester, Linda Ronstadt, Barry Manilow--and I've loved what they have done. Well Rod, congratulations. You have done an excellent job with this recording. Thank you for picking out such fantastic songs (my favorite is the last track--""That's All""). You sound great and the production is top notch. Please consider another album like this in the future!"
1,Just Horrible,"I was in a large chain bookstore the other day. I desperately needed to buy an important book for a pressing meeting coming up. This Rod Stewart album of standards was playing in the background. It took everything in my power to remain there searching for the book while this album was playing. I wanted to run out of the store.I am an enormous fan of music from the 20's, 30's and 40's. I also liked Rod Stewart in the 70's. But his interpretation of these gorgeous, timeless standards is just embarrassing. And note to the record label that invested in this: this should not be the ""default"" career choice of the aging pop star. Let's honor these classics with vocalists who truly have the talent to sing them. To those who like this album, head immediately to the shelves of your favorite record store and purchase a Sinatra, B. Holliday, S. Vaughan, E. Fitzgerald, or a Peggy Lee CD...learn from the masters how this music is done. Sorry, Rod."
3,A notable effort but NO cigar,"I like American standards just as much as the other guy, but it seems as though Stewart's choices are too similar in composition and tone. If he had just had more of a variety, an uptempo followed by a ballad, the album might just work.However, the overabundance of slower-paced classics makes it seem as if the singer is singing the same old song,...And that ""tune"" wears off rather quickly."
1,Noooooo!!!!!,"Please go buy Louis Armstrong! Go buy Ella Fitzgerald! Hell, go buy Frank Sinatra. BUT IF YOU LIKE JAZZ AT ALL, DON'T BUY ROD STEWART!!!!!!!!"
1,Save Your Money!,"I already had his ""As Time Goes By"" album and listen to it constantly so I figured it would be a natural to buy this one. Couldn't wait for it to be delivered. Played it once and it was Awful all the way around. His voice, the accompanyment, the sound! It's sitting in front of me as I type this and I have no desire to ever play it again, that's how bad it is. On the other hand, his ""As Time Goes By"" disk is fabulous! But if I had bought ""It Had to Be You"" first it would have ended there. Unfortutely, I can't get my money back. Don't make the same mistake unless you adore this guy and will put up with anything he recorded no matter how bad it is."
1,ANOTHER CORPSE FOR THE RETRO MEAT WAGON,"Speaking purely for myself, of course, I find it creepy that one of the greatest rock and roll voices of all time has completely devolved into Lounge Lizardom. Finally reaching the nadir that began with ""Do ya Think I'm Sexy"", Stewart wheezes through this sickening dead-horse repertoire with all the soul and passion of a doorstop, accompanied by ""Smooth jazz"" hacks like Dave Koz (what, Kenny G was busy?). Anybody who likes to think they're listening to ""sophisticated"", ""romantic"" and ""timeless"" music is welcome to this dreck. I'll be listening to ""Every Picture Tells a Story"" with the volume cranked."
5,It Had to Be You...The Great American Song Book,"I absolutely LOVE this CD. All of these songs are favorites of mine and Rod Stewart's voice lends such an enjoyable sound to these melodies and lyrics. It is so relaxing to listen to. It's great stuff for your home, your car, or even for a cozy soak in your tub with a glass of your favorite wine and your favorite person."
5,A Slice of Americana,"At a time when many Americans are going back to their cultural roots with a renewed sense of appreciation, this CD really hits the spot! Sure, Rod's voice has changed somewhat over the years and perhaps as a result of his recent surgery; but his charm and mature stylization seem uniquely suited to these selections. My all-time favorite Rod Stewart CD is If We Fall in Love Tonight, which also showcases his softer side; this new CD ranks right up there with my previous favorite."
4,a nice world weary quality,"This a very fine album. I have always loved these songs, but have often craved hearing a more world weary voice singing them. Ever since I first heard Tom Waits sing ""Somewhere"" (from West Side Story) on his Blue Valentine record, I have longed to hear a raspy voiced rocker attempt the classics. Rod does the trick here nicely (although his voice seems a little too high pitched, it retains it's world weary quality). This one will grow on you."
3,Let's Hear it for Linda Ronstadt,"Listen Rod Stewart can do this if he wants to..its not bad as far as vanity productions by aging rock stars go..but he's not Rickie Lee Jones that's for sure..and all these folks owe a major debt to Linda Ronstadt, who had the cojones to do the Nelson Riddle and Sinatra songbook back in the 80s..everyone is doing this shtick on her shoulders..check those albums out again..while you're at it go listen to a few hours of Frank"
3,why did they do that ???,"My thoughts are that Rod does a pretty reasonable job, but the mixing seems pretty awful. All the backing instruments lack dynamics, as if they have had the life and character compressed out of them so they can't take centre stage from Rod. Bass is overly emphasised and a bit boomy on many tracks. They have turned what could have been a good recording into a very mediocre one.I will certainly be having a good listen to Vol 2 before I buy it, to see if they have done a better job."
5,A bridge to the past,"I was as surprised and delighted as anyone to stumble across this album. It never occurred to me that Rod Stewart could sing these songs with such insight and brilliance, but he does and this album is the proof... and then some. Rod Stewart as a familiar voice that I strongly associate with the 1970s and 1980s, provides a perfect bridge to the 1930s. I hear Billy Holiday and Chet Baker's influence in these songs, yet Rod goes beyond mere impersonation and makes these songs his own, he combines their interpretation with his own and creates something new. Well done Rod, I suspect this album will stand as a classic; all accolades it receives are well deserved. *****"
3,Rod's voice just doesn't cut it on these classics,"If you're a Rod Stewart fan, you'll probably enjoy this, but if you're intested in interesting versions of old standards and american classics, this isn't for you. Better stick to Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennet, Steve Tyrell, Bobby Caldwell or Harry Connick, Jr. Rod's coarse voice isn't consistent with the soft, mellow melodies of these classics."
2,try again!...,"I bought rod's new cd today and couldn't wait to hear him put ""his style"" on some old standards. Well, I wish I had waited to review the cd on amazon before I purchased it. I find the whole thing a let down. One of the best things about Stewart has always been ""his style"", you always knew it was him from the first note. This cd has nothing to do with Stewart, except his voice projecting some lyrics. Too bad, the classics done ""his way"" sounded like a good idea."
2,a real disappointment,"I bought this CD with great expectations,however after hearing it several times I have to say that Rod Stewart failed.His singing is unable to convey the soft swing mood which is fundamental to this beautiful songs.His voice sounds dull and does not transmit any emotion.I think Mr Stewart should return to what he really does masterfully,pop/rock"
3,OK album,"The songs are good, not as good as the first album last year. Rod Stewart's voice just doesn't compare to the Frank or the others of that era."
5,Rod Stewart At His Best,"I've been a fan of Rod Stewart since my teens. I have loved practically all of his music, but this one tops the charts. The music is mellow and familiar - I grew up with this music - but with the well-known, singular voice we know so well. I loved this album and listen to it at work all the time because it is so relaxing. I hope there are more albums like this in Rod's future."
2,Great Songs ... But Not Great Vocals,Sorry - I am usually very easily pleased - and I love remakes of old classic songs. I bought this CD and was disappointed. Rod Stewart should stick to what he does best - rock - and stay away from songs that require real vocal talent. I know many people reviewed this CD and loved it ... but I thought his raspy singing was not how this collection of songs were meant to be performed.
4,Bizarre Fun,"I enjoyed this book. It is a mathematical treatise from 1699 that purports to prove that the Gospels were true, and speculates on the exact date of Christ's return.There is a lengthy foreword which places the author Craige in terms of his times (post-Locke, and concurrent with the beginning of secularization in Europe).Craige makes a few interesting mistakes in the text. He posits a clear number for how long a witness should be believed. He says that it's 200 years. He also thinks that it's only when Christ's message is no longer believed by anyone at all that he will return. He bases this on a calculation adding the Gospel writers (200 years a piece), plus the disciples testimony. And he comes up with the year 3150 AD.Absurd in places, but brilliant logic."
1,What the hell is this?,And why would a beautiful women like brandy appearingin this godawful videothe single sucks.Pure cash money rip-off.
5,this man makes good music,THIS MAN HAS REAL TALENT .I SAW HIM THIS WEEKEND.THAT WHY I CAME LOOKING FOR HIS MUSIC TRUST ME. I GOING TO BUY ALL HIS CD THAT I CAN FIND.
5,Life Saver,"I suffer from Seborrhoeic dermatitis on my forehead. I've visited quite a few dermatologist and tried many prescription creams and well as over the counter creams and nothing worked. I purchased this cream over 3 weeks ago and I can't begin to explain how much better my skin feels and looks. The cream does exactly what it says, it stopped my itching, stopped my flaking, and stopped my inflammation. It reduced my breakouts and overall my skin looks 80% better. I know there is no cure for SD, but this cream does a wonderful job of keeping all the pesky symptoms of SD at bay and I can function without worrying about the condition of my skin....love, love, love."
5,Most excellent!,"This is the best product I have found for the psoriasis on my scalp and nearly makes the psoriasis on my elbows disappear. But as with all psoriasis products, I have to keep purchasing it because it never goes away."
1,Didn't work...,Product actually made my skin worse not better. I know with an issue like Dermatitis each person may react differentlybut this product did not work for me. It actually made my skin more red and flakey and now I am having to find a productthat will help erase the new damage done...
5,"Have red, flaky, facial seb. dermatitis? This works great!","I could not find anything at the store for for facial seb. dermatitis. It is great for flaky skin around nose, cheeks, eyebrows, etc. I tried all kinds of lotion but to no avail nothing helped. When my face got wet, as soon as it dried it would get flaky. Very frustrating. This worked by the second day of using it. I don't even use t daily and it has worked. In the past, ketoconazole seemed to help a little in the past, but never really cleared it up totally. This has worked perfectly!"
1,flaming red,"I thought my face was red before(seb derm), but it was much brighter red(and inflamed) after using this product for 2 days. What a waste of money!"
3,Good book if you know ASP.NET,"The author definitely knows his stuff, but it is not for those who are not very knowledgeable in C# and ASP.NET. Hoffman has some excellent techniques he is applying to ASP.NET, but you will need to spend some serious time to grasp his concepts. He seems to be an excellent programmer, but not a teacher for those trying to grasp ASP.NET."
2,Not much help and support for installation,"The book doesn't provide much help even to install its own sample code. First, you have to look around very hard to find the source code to download (it is no longer in wrox.com). Second, the database is for restore to SQL Server 2000 only. It doesn't provide any kind of script file that I can make little modify to install it to a SQL Server 7 or MSDE 2000. You will be stuck if you don't have SQL Server 2000 installed. Third, the source code installation is not a install and run, I have to do some change to be able to opetn the solution."
2,Too Brief,"The Container mapping is the second chapter is good...I read a book for a day and return to book shop for next day. I am looking for books to discuss the whole architecure with e-commerce site. This book just breifly describe each topic, and some difficult topic such as inventory control are missed out intentionally...The author says it is waste of resource, then I would say I waste my money. I pay $50bulks for the book and the content should be much more enriched...MSDN has a very good example there, The Duwich Bookshop, Duwich Online.....Those are the materials that I am looking for....Disappointed"
