2,"Like many, I bought into the hype","After hearing so much about this author who was uninvited from the oprah show, i was pretty curious. I think this book took me about a month and a half to read, I'm a very busy college student but somehow I just couldn't get myself to pick it up as much as I should have. Its not that it was bad, it was just easy to put down without needing to know what was going to happen next. Still, I finished it and I have to say that there are many funny, true to life moments in the book which made it worth it. Certain aspects of the Lambert family mirror ones of my own, Franzen did write very real characters but the story kind of felt half-baked. Without giving anything away, the book kind of ends abruptly after the writer put way too much detail into everything else. I believe this book wouldn't have suffered if he would have cut out about 200 pages. Maybe then, I actually would have taken less than a month to finish it."
1,"Slow, confusing, distasteful",I couldn't get into this book at all. I have read a lot of the Oprah Book Club books. This was totally different from any of those. Most of the books she chooses has a lesson to learn. This book did not. I do not recommend this book at all.
2,If you like being depressed you will like this novel,"I think The Corrections was one of the most depressing stories I have ever read. I managed to read the whole book but I never felt like anything good was going to come out of it. Every relationship in this book was beyond dysfunctional. I generally read to escape into the life of someone else, but I did not want any part of this family. I especially disliked the relationship between the oldest son and his wife. I really hope that this was just the exaggeration of a relationship the author has witnessed. If this is at all based in fact I weep for the couple it was based on. This novel definitely made me feel better about my familial relationships. We may be dysfunctional in some ways but we don't even come close to the family in The Corrections. Mr. Franzen, Lighten up!"
1,not for everyone,"If you're not american, this book won't mean much to you. this didn't stop me from reading the book, but I did not enjoy it."
1,a crime against literature,"I am amazed that this book won a literary award andalso won Oprah's bookclub. I bought the book andwas just grossed out. this is midwest dysfunctionalityat its best. my only question is oprah, honey, what onearth were you thinking ???"
2,Nothing Original,"On the third page I recognized his writing style mimiced the style Dave Foster Wallace used in his 800 page pontification, Infinite Jest.Although Corrections does result in a novel, his priorities as a writer seemed be more in showing up Wallace in the world of hipster writers than they did in creating believable characters with a point.I would have given him more stars if I thought his style and ideas were original."
3,Is That All There Is?,"I wanted to see what all the hype was about - like most people - and couldn't believe my eyes when this book was on the shelf at the library. I snatched it up and dove in. The story is engrossing, the prose is excellent, the feeling is there, but I was disappointed with all of the unnecessary prattle. I did not care about the molecular structure of the drug Corecktal. I did not need to know the most minute detail of the operations in the Ukraine. This slowed the story and interrupted the flow. I think a good 150 pages could have been pared and the book as a whole would have been better for it."
2,Too Slow and Over Written!,"I found the first 300 pages of this book to be so slow and over written, which wouldn't be so bad if one of these characters we likeable but they are so prentious and self involved.That being said Franzen does make some poigant observations about family dynamics."
1,"Maybe it got better, but I didn't get that far","I tried, I really tried. I hung in there until the excruciating, long, drawn out description of Alfred trying to sit on Chip's chaise longue. I don't know if he ever did sit down. Yawn."
2,too clever by half,"Around page #370 I quit the book. I just couldn't stand another wry observation or witty--oh so witty--page-long sentence. Don't get me wrong, you'll be hooked at the beginning, but in short-order I was praying for that guy in the front--yeah, YOU, Mr. Franzen, to move the heck outta the way and let his characters and story free themselves from his clutches.A real smarmy read that I ultimately could no longer stomach for all the cleverness and obvious arrogance of the author."
2,Did not live up to the hype,"I got this book and read it with my friends for a book club. Over the course of the month, I was the only one of five who was actually able to finish it.Some comments from our Club:Who does he think he is?Utterly awful.Will use it for my cat's litter boxI did manage to get through it, but I am not convinced it was worth my time. The story REALLy dragged and I had little empathy for any of the characters.The author needs to get down fom his self-appointed celebrity and actually write a book worth reading."
2,As Pretentious As The Author,"This is not great literature, despite Franzen's pretensions. Refusing to be on Oprah's list was a smart move to give Franzen publicity which his writing couldn't have generated on its own."
1,i read it because i like j franzen,"I love johnathan franzen's non-fiction work. I really enjoy it.but this book was awful. I only read it because I was visiting my in-laws in southern Arizona and had nothing else to do. I was looking for a plot. When I read a book I think the character or protagonist has something they need to seek, some goal, a quest. But this book had none of that. Just rambling, rambling, rambling. Mr Franzen, please stick to the non-fiction."
2,dysfunctional last supper,"for the sake of preserving his "" street credibility, "" jonathan has shot himself in the foot by dissing oprah's endorsement.why write books if you dont want them to sell? he sounds like one of those fashionably tortured rock stars who hate being famous....i read all kinds of stuff, not just the literary stuff. i admit, not all of oprah's books have been great, but she has picked some good ones...most writers would kill for the exposure jonathan has sneezed on. it's just average. who wants to read about a dysfunctional family's last dinner together. oprah did jonathan a favor"
2,No Connection,"Let me first admit that I have not read the book. Why then, am I writing a review? Because I am sick of buying recommended books - best sellers and award winners - that are pulp fiction.This book was touted as one of the best written in 2001. On the first page I read: ""He'd had his nap and there would be no local news until five o'clock. Two empty hours were a sinus in which infections bred.""A sinus in which infections bred? I'm sorry, but I can't read an author that uses that kind of analogy on the first page of a long novel. My guess is that people who devour ""best sellers"" and find them enjoyable will be able to overlook this type of asymmetric and awkward language.Good luck! I hope you didn't buy the book like I did. Get it from the library."
4,A book with great and terrible aspects,"First off, I almost threw it away during the prologue: over-written, tortured prose that is a chore to read is no way to start off a 600-page book. But very quickly the amazing depth of the main characters comes through, their humanity, and the excellently-written dialogue. Franzen's strengths are amazing, but his weakness in description is very off-putting. Still, the characters are too vividly-realized to just ignore. Terrific book, even if it's not a terrific read."
2,overrated,one of the most overrated books by one of the most overrated authors i have ever read. easily could have been 100 pages shorter. the entire middle section was laborous. too much useless material neither advancing the plot nor shedding light on characters. dont read this unless you really dig boredom.
2,Correction...This was painful to read!,"Although the author has a very proficient use of the English language, the long, drawn out individual stories are too much for me! I struggle just to read 4-5 pages a night when I normally devour books. It is slow and I feel as if the characters were overly explained and overdone. I want to shout, ""I get it already"" after delving into every minute of a character's life. I can see the human side here, but for heaven's sake....cut about 200 pages out of this thing!"
2,"Not terrible, but certainly NOT a masterpiece.","Well...the book is readable, but I think if Franzen was attempting to make a statement, he's failed utterly. Frankly, it's another case of ""much ado about nothing"". Not funny, not though-provoking...and certainly nothing new. But, unlike most of these over-hyped novels, I was able to read it all the way through without disgust or boredom. I just wouldn't particularly choose to ever read it again. And for those who compare this to Dostoyevski or Faulkner, that is really an insult to those writers (by the way,and this is admittedly irrelevant, I have read ""Karamazov"" three times in my life..the first time when I was in fifth grade!). Not a great American novel, and you certainly won't be missing anything if you skip this one. Dostoyevski, Tolstoi, Faulkner, etc...have nothing to worry about"
3,Less Irony,"First, let me praise Franzen for what he does well. He is a very good observer of 21st century life. He is a very good stylist. And he can be funny and cute.But after a while, I got tired of funny and cute. I mean he just kept pouring it on--i.e. the dysfunctional American family and the myriad renderings of modern life's superficialities.My wish for Franzen, is that he take his very considerable stylistic talents, go underground, invest himself in a full-fledged middle age crisis, and emerge on the other side with a mature book that has less irony and more substance."
3,book of the year?,"After reading and enjoying the ""27th City"" and after reading all of the reviews of ""the Corrections"", I expected much more. The characters are interesting and i read the book straight through over a period of two days but I don't think that the book justifies the hype. Its worth buying and its worth reading but it is not the great American Novel."
2,Good start.....then BORING,"At the beginning of Corrections, I thought I would really enjoy this book. WRONG. Talk about a dysfunctional family!! There is absolutely nothing to redeem any of the characters. At times, the book was so ""wordy"", I scanned paragraph after paragraph. If you want to be REALLY depressed and REALLY tired of reading...try this ...it will certainly fill the bill. I scanned (very quickly) the last 100 pages or so because I was just worn out with it. Really don't know why I stayed with it that long except I kept thinking....something interesting surely will happen that caused this to be a best seller."
1,Love it or hate it,"I think this is pretty interesting. I read the reviews after trying several times to read this book. I finally gave up after realizing it bored me totally. I just didn't care what happended to any of them.This is the type of book I usually enjoy but I found the writing pretentious and lazy. I finally gave up. The interesting part for me is that some people absolutely loved it and gave it a great reveiw and others felt as I did. Go figure. BTW, the American Beauty test didn't work for me. I liked the movie quite a bit but obviously didn't care for the book."
1,...Awful,This was one of the worst books I ever read. Don't bother with this book. I don't care that it won some award...
3,Characterization Flaws,"Franzen is masterful in his storytelling ability, but the characterization was in serious need of editing. For example, the women refer to all the sexual scenes very manlike (parts is parts). I don't know many women who refer to their breasts as tits, nor do I know many women who would describe the mechanics of sex over the emotions. This needed to be edited by a woman to balance out the truth of the characters. Franzen's grasp of language is incredible, but he needs to get out more and meet some decent people to write about. I was actually rooting for all of them to be killed off. : )"
2,The Corrections,"If it weren't for the last section of this book, I would be reluctant to give it even 1 star. After struggling through to the final page, I loaned the book to a friend who gave up after less than 100 pages. Franzen is mighty lucky to have had his book selected for Oprah's Book Club, however, it does support his remarks regarding her tendency to pick less than great books."
2,Boring,"I didn't like this book because it was boing, plain and simple. Don't get me wrong, Franzen definitely has awesome command of the English language (you might need to keep a dictionary handy), but the fact still remains that I did not find it interesting and had to force myself to finish it."
3,"Expansive, Undisciplined","This book makes a lot of promises that it ultimately cannot keep. Franzen peers into some interesting aspects of culture, family life and behavior but ultimately leaves us with a rather shallow interpretation of all of them. The language is quite beautiful and the book is immensely readable, but the plotting is virtually non-existent and -- where it exists -- uninspired. At 568 pages, the novel displays a lot of breadth but a shocking lack of depth. Ultimately, we are left with simplicities like ""Gary is afraid."" This kind of thing is hardly worth waiting for. Three stars for the language and prose construction. Pleasant but quite overrated."
2,Painfully disturbing,A classic it is not. Oppressive use of the English language. He develops a scene with so much detail you want to scream in agony. Nearly 600 pages with an ending that simply *happens* after ad nauseum descriptors of non-events throughout the book. Franzen also appears to be scatalogically obsessed. ...
5,Perfect title to a near-perfect novel,"Jonathan Franzen fully deserves the awards his latest novel has garnered. I was intrigued throughout with what his title *The Corrections* meant to the story and to the superbly wrought characters of this old-very modern family. He did not let me down. The word (Corrections) was one of Franzen's many scapels with which he expertly sliced and diced this family, modern culture, and all geographies between St. Jude and Eastern Europe. His knowledge is astonishing. His metaphors are wit perfected -- a pierce of the rapier that leaves a bloodless and painless wound that the victim never feels. It is not fair -- where Franzen's characters real people -- to so completely penetrate their protective masks. But he does. And the reader benefits, joyously and most pleasurably."
4,"A Fine Novel, But Not A Literary Masterpiece","Jonathan Franzen's ""The Corrections"" is undoubtedly the finest depiction of a dysfunctional family I've come across in fiction. He is a splendid writer with a keen sense of imagination and excellent literary style, and he has wrought a marvellous achievement bringing the Lambert family to life. However, I found too many of the family's problems seem a bit too contrived, most notably, the strange odyssey which Chip Lambert undertakes from academia to new-style Russian organized crime in Lithuania. I agree with a previous reviewer that Franzen should have chosen another part of the former Soviet Union, not Lithuania; surely the Central Asian republics or Georgia might have been more ideal locales. Still I must commend Franzen for his enthusiastic, often satirical look, at contemporary society. However, I strongly doubt that ""The Corrections"" is the literary masterpiece of our time; it is clearly an accolade that veers too closely to hyperbole."
4,Uncorrections,"I think the Uncorrections are the whole point of the book. All these awful people are busily correcting and criticizing *one another*, and it does no good. Nobody changes. The Enids of this world never do. I know. My mother is one, and as Carolyn says at one point, people like that think everyone has a problem but them. I had to watch my father die of Parkinson's and senile dementia under my mother's tender ministrations. I think she literally nagged him to death. Gee, what a trip down Memory Lane!Much as I hated reading The Corrections, I thought it was a wonderful, true-to-life representation of exactly the sort of dysfunctional family I myself grew up in. You don't have to like the characters to appreciate how skillfully and with how much insight they are portrayed. Makes you wonder which of this nasty crew little Jonathan was. (I'm betting on Chip.)P.S. Another nice little irony: My book club is discussing The Corrections on Sunday, June 16. Father's Day."
2,Check this book out from your local library,"This book can be best described as okay, but not great. I picked up this book, because I wanted to see what the hype was all about. Don't get me wrong, it was an alright book, but is definitely not worth spending [ the money ]. The book starts out really slowly, and it took me about a week just to get through the first 200 pages. Throughout the book, most of the characters are very one dimensional, and when the author finally got to the catharsis, I really did not care..."
3,All dressed up and nowhere to go,"Here's another postmodern novel about a dysfunctional family. Franzen has writing talent for sure. His clever repetition of the word ""corrections"" even begs, at first, for a re-reading, to discover all the multiple meanings. But, in the end, the book suffers the fate of all postmodern novels. It can have no conclusion because postmodernists have no way of drawing any. The book just stops, despite an attempt by Franzen to ""wrap things up."" His last chapter falls flat and leaves the reader nowhere. Too bad, because the guy can really write."
2,Great Expectations...Great Disappointment,"The idea was good. The execution was poor. I had a feeling the writer had kept a journal for about 15 years and felt he had to get every observation he had ever made into one very long book. Maybe instead of blaming him, we should ask why his editor fell asleep on the job."
4,"Started out slow, but got much better in the end.","After picking up this book and reading the reviews. I thought this was going to be a long read for me. Well at first it started out slow for me. I struggled to get into the few pages.But once I got to Gary's story is when the book started to pick up for me. Each of the characters had there own story to tell and sometimes I felt like they took just too long.Overall the story was wonderfull and the last few hundred pages kept me hooked to the point where I never wanted to put down the book.The end to me was something I had expected and kinda knew would happen, but the rest of book kept me wondering how things would turn out except for a few points."
1,"yes, it was an oprah book, after all","Franzen's self-created little tempest in a teapot over having his book selected for Oprah's book club just goes to show how unaware he really is. His book fits Oprah's template perfectly... contemporary disjointed and dysfunctional family members blunder through depressing scenarios with no redemption in sight. I found this gloomy, disgusting, and preciously self-aware by turns, and all of it turned my stomach. If I want to learn about a dysfunctional family, I'll look at my own, thank you very much."
1,The Disaffections,"Despite the glut of publicity and laudatory reviews, The Corrections is a dull, unimaginative story that certainly seems like Oprah fare. The characters come across as manipulated and utterly predictable. This book will be completely forgotten within a short time despite a likely movie version. Why is it that such mediocre narrative is the only thing pushed by the publishers? Oh yeah, they're all part of big corporations now."
1,OH MY GOSH!!!,"I'm sorry, but Oprah had it way off on this one! Reading this book was like going to see a bad movie, but you can't get up to leave; you just keep telling yourself ""It's going to get better!""! I wasted entirely too much time trying to figure out what the heck this book was all about. Now that I'm finished with the book, I'm still asking myself that same question. I was expecting a truthful, but yet, humorous book about the American family. Didn't find it here!"
1,Depressing Dissapointment,"This book was extremely dissapointing. After reading the first 100 or so pages, I felt let down and unsatisfied. The characters were consistantly negative and dull, and I found myself not caring what happened to them one way or the other. The plot took several unrealistic turns and I felt that the writing was un-necessarily ""jumpy"". I continuously pursuaded myself to continue reading hoping that it would get better. Unfourtuately, half way through the novel, I couldn't take anymore, so I jumped to the end. Almost to my relief, after reading the last 20 pages, I concluded that the overly depressing themes continue to the end. I was perfectly satisfied to put the book on a shelf to collect dust, never again to return to it. I have never left a book unfinished. Don't waste your time."
1,started off great but....,"this book is terrible. It started off with a bang but halfway through it, I found the characters so unlikable that I didnt even care to finish it. Every single character is either crazy, depressed, or completely selfish. The mother is the worst character....she is just cheap and awful. Save yourself the time, dont bother getting this book. Even if you borrow free from the library, its a completely waste of time."
3,Overrated and pretentious,"Has anyone else said it was overrated and pretentious? They have? Good. Because it really is. It is entertaining; I enjoyed it, and it has some clever and entertaining parts. And you cannot deny that it is well written and well crafted. Still, I didn't care about the characters. Some of you are probably going to say, that wasn't the point, but for me it was. I had to care to care about the book, and I didn't. And something about Franzen just screams ""unrepentant Chip"". You don't diss Oprah. You just don't."
1,"Horrible, horrible, horrible","Can you sue an author for wasting your time? That is what I felt like doing after I read this book. I have to say that I felt like I was reading the dictionary due to the wordiness of the book. I read at least three or four books a week and always finish. With this one, I kept saying to myself, ""cut your losses and put it down."" I also found many of Franzen's descriptions long winded and sometimes completely unnecessary. It gets one star from me mainly because by the end, I was mildly curious as to how everything would play out for each of the characters. Otherwise, it was a very boring read. Don't waste your money or your time!"
1,"I should have read the first ""free"" chapter.","One other reviewer stated you will "" love it or hate it."" I hated it. Slugged it out but finally stopped reading and deleted so it may not infect any other books."
3,Not One Of Oprah's Best Books,"This book is interesting, and I finished it. If you want a great book, read 'a fine balance'. It's a book that has stayed with me long after I've read it."
4,schizophrenogenic reunions,"The Corrections is literary psychological probing at its near best, providing a highly amusing, intriguing portrayal of humans on the brink of ""normalcy"" but not quite able to make the connection. Actually, within these pages ""normalcy"" and ""abnormality"" are creatively redefined. Situations seem to take on greater appeal and seeming vivacity the stranger they get. Families are always wondering ""Is it just us?"" Are we the only crazy ones?Franzen provides a way for the reader to delight in the idiosyncracies of his characters, richly developed personae of paranoia and paralyzation of emotions. A well-educated, witty writer to be reckoned with - I tip my hat, Mr. Franzen.This is a thoroughly enjoyable work."
2,Depressing isn't even the point,"Okay folks, we know that the content of this book was a tad on the depressing side. However, that was not at all the problem that I had with it. ""A Fine Balance"", another Oprah book, was one of the most depressing books I've ever read, but I loved it. The key? The characters. Try as I might, I just could not bring myself to like any of these people. Dysfunction is one thing. But reading about a bunch of whiny people with infantile desires and poor judgment is not my idea of fun."
5,whoa Nellie!,"This is one of the best books I have read in a few years, since English Passengers. It's not often that someone can hash over the old family saga and bring up such fresh and human material. A friend told me that Jonathan Franzen went on a bit, but he is worth listening to and reading. On a more mundane point, does ""mixed grill"" really exist? Let's hope not."
2,"Skillful but ultimately empty book,","Franzen is a very talented writer, but in the end, I could not find any empathy with any of his characters. He trys to ""show off"" his broad areas of knowledge (food,economics,etc)to the detriment of finding something to care about in the lives of his characters as they slowly, but surely unravel. Frazen must lead a very depressing life, if he is hanging out with the self-defeating and perverse people he writes about! Also, I found that his characterization of the females in the book to be much more crtical and stinging than the males! Good for Oprah for ""disinviting"" him. I fear he finds himself more impressive than I did!"
3,"Interesting, but...","Dysfunctional family, annoying characters... but still mildly entertaining & amusing. How three kids from the same family could be SO [messed] up is beyond me, but can sure make for some funny moments. Overall, though, a bit of a letdown after hearing all the hype. It just goes to show what good P.R. can do for a book (or movie)...."
1,Boring,"Did anyone except me find this book to be extremely boring? I love to read, but could only read 10 to 12 pages at a time, before putting it down. The characters are shallow, the story line drags on and on without going anywhere. Of course the family is dysfunctional, but dysfunctional can be fun and interesting......these characters are not!!Even trashy romance novels can be more enjoyable than this book. The author's writing is very much like his character, Chip's.....Going on forever without getting to the point.Most boring book I have purchased in years"
2,Not Worth It,"This book was a struggle to get through. While it does have some redeeming qualities, I found the book difficult to get through. If you're looking for a novel that you can't put down, this is not it. Nothing about the story or characters grabbed me. It seemed the author just wrote to see his words on page and the reader suffered the consequences."
2,The dark side of the human heart,"I tried to like this book; however, I found the plot to be bleak and sad and the very opposite of noteworthy. There is not one likeable character doing one kind, charitable or generous act during the entire plodding book. I am not looking for an uplifting book with a ""message"" or a puerile happy ending, but I would like to think that there is more to life and living than is characterized in this book. I like books that make me think while I am reading them and, if I am fortunate, when I have finished reading them. Jonathan Franzen has created a group of greedy, self-serving characters who never deviate from our initial introduction to them. The author has talent - the characters are well defined and the plot makes sense within the confines of the structure created by Franzen. The world is surely peopled by persons who belie his definition of living within a family. This book saddened my heart."
2,The HYPE machine is working OVERTIME!,I don't know how this could be called a Great American Novel. There are so many points I don't know how to begin. Only that the hype machine is ridiculous and buzz sells a lot of books. Franzen hasn't even lived an interesting life to reiterate his experiences (living cooped up in a flat with his ex-wife writing for years going out once a year <anniversary> doesn't make for an interesting human being). It's academic writing (I suspect an MFA in his past). Really interesting writers live life and don't need to STUDY their guts out to write. The New York Times review was the most accurate I saw. Kaukutani <-sp? was right on and the most honest of all critics who read this. Get real people. You could never call this the best book of the year. At best it's a really good episode of Thirty Something. And getting on Oprah's list - Nuff Said! Read James Salter instead.
2,The Corrections,"...P>At first, I laughed a lot and thought the book was funny, entertaining and well-written. However, after about 200 pages, I became a little confused and a lot bored. What is the greatness this book manifests, I wondered. The writing ceased to be entertaining. The characters began to seem extremely foolish and unbelievable to me. The peculiar juxtaposition of dates and time seemed arbitrary and unnecessary.I still don't understand why so many publications whose reviewers I usually respect think this is such a great piece of writing. In reality, I think a great hoax has just been perpetrated on us poor unsuspecting readers. I DID read to the end but I'm not recommending this book to any of my reader friends."
1,I don't think Mr. Franzen has to worry...,"...about being too much of a commercial success. I'm not interested in even picking up another of his books, let alone purchasing it. I have never in my life read anything so self-consciously literary and affected. The characters are not good, and the events so far from real life that I find it difficult to believe Mr. Franzen actually lives on this planet. Also, what is with the frequent use of just a letter and a blank line (D______ etc.) to denote colleges, rivers, and so forth? Yes, I know that Edgar Allan Poe and his contemporaries were fond of this conceit, but really! It just serves to pull the reader out of the (admittedly uncompelling) story line. Either you're trying to make up a plausible name to use when he does this, or you'rethinking, ""Good grief; that's really annoying."" Plus there's his brilliant use of the word ""corrections"" over and over again. Wow."
1,What in God's name was Oprah thinking?,"I generally trust the Oprah book club to guide me to good books, but this book is not worth the effort. Unfortunately, (...) I paid full retail price for the book. The plot was disjointed, not particularly interesting and extremely wordy. At the end I was skipping paragraphs and pages at a time just trying to find anything worth spending my time on."
2,Endlessly boring,"This book was endlessly boring. I had trouble getting through it and only kept on with it because it was well-reviewed, I paid for the hardcover, and I kept thinking SOMETHING must happen. It finally did at the end, but it never should have taken so long to get there. What a strain!"
2,borrowed too much from white noise,"Am I the only one who sees how much of this book has been borrowed from Delillo's White Noise (and his other books)? The same fascination with brand names, the same oddly precocious children, the same babble about psychopharmaceuticals, the same weird cast of international mystery men contrasted against the bland landscape of American suburbia...The problem is, he's not as good a writer as Delillo. As another reviewer pointed out, his characters are so totally narcisistic and one-dimensional, they're unmemorable. And boring.Also, this book is way too long and needed editing."
2,Correct Me If I'm Wrong But...,"....is this book boringly pedantic or what? I think Franzen needs a spanking for putting his readers through paragraph after paragraph, page after page of extraneous details. I simply skipped these passages until I got back to the main thread of the narrative. Alas, I must admit I did keep reading because of *all the hype* I had read about this book. NONE of the characters is likeable! I think that's the main thing that stuck with me. He's a good writer. He has a way with words, I'll give him that much. But, overall, the book is much ado about nothing."
2,Puzzled by praise for this soap opera with pretensions,"It must be that male writers and critics just don't read books written by women, because there are hundreds of books so much better than this soap opera of a novel. But this book has no staying power and won't even be read by anyone in a few years, whereas Marilynn Robinson, in HOUSEKEEPING has a far more interestingly dysfuntional family, the members of which all hold our interest. Many great writers write about unlikable people, but Jonathan Franzen doesn't like his own characters, and we never get a chance even to know what they're like. This is a book that makes you despair about being human, but when you finally get all the way through it you put it aside and despair of the time you wasted reading it. This book's ideal audience are white male prep school students or college English majors."
3,"Not really real, not really fantasy","This one is not too different than that movie American Beauty, just another person saying the American family is dysfunctional. Well we all know that, and who really cares to hear you say it again. The book's characters are no more real than the movie's, and I say yippie, that's great, I don't go for realistic characters. But then this writer doesn't give you any good fantasy, either. It's just the sort of room-temperature tea that we get in most of our hours of our lives, so you can't offer much of a good reason for plunking down your money or your time for room-temperature tea when you get that every day. Some people say that's such a good picture of it all, how things have come to be now, but I say just fill in tha same picture yourself by lying on your bed and hearing your family's bellies grumble. Not real interesting, even if you think the quirky style adds anything. Better off with fantasy, or with some really realistic book if you like reality so much."
3,The title is the best thing about this book.,"I don't really love the sex scenery. A teenaged girl throwing herself upon an ugly old coworker? Unconvincingly in love with boss'wife? Maybe he should have stayed in the role of his male character, who humped a sofa."
2,The Corrections,"Franzen is obviously talented, ambitious, and far-reaching in this much discussed, too hyped novel. His reach, however, is faulty, but it's worth the read to see how faulty and to see what dubious fiction gets published these days. The book is flawed because Franzen essentially dislikes all his characters except possibly the bisexual daughter. He certainly is no profound examiner of the ""American soul,"" to paraphrase one favorable critic. Instead, Franzen has trapped himself between a cynical impulse and a tragi-comic one. His description of typical Midwesterners with ""bratwurst fingers"" is heavy-handed satire, suggesting a disturbing prejudice shown in his portrayals of some other characters and situations European and European-American. Finally, his ending is forced, unconvincing, and lays much of the dysfunctional blame on the dead father. The sins of the father visited upon...Yawn!"
3,What's all the hubbub...bub?,"I wish I could do a good George Bush, Sr. impression...but just imagine him saying this...""Don't get it!"" Portions of the storyline were interesting, and the bouncing from sibling to sibling character twists was extremely well executed, but for the most part this novel was just OKAY. The most confusing thing is the title...since it is not explained at all until the end of the novel and even then, ""The Corrections"" wasn't a well chosen summary of the story...perhaps a better title would have been, ""Misunderstandings""."
1,Hours of my life that I will never get back...,"OK, so what did I miss? I hated this book!! Actually, I can't think of many books that I hated more than this book. Perhaps I am not quite as avant-garde as other readers,or perhaps my childhood was just too functional to understand this piece of work. I enjoy suspending belief as much as the next reader, but this is asking for too much. I felt like no plot was ever really established and that the author never really got a handle on his characters - he tried to portray them in too many dimensions and ended up making me hate all of them (particularly Enid), with the exception of Alfred. As I said, this book represents wasted hours of my life that I will never get back...but it represents 7 years of Mr. Franzen's life that he will never get back. Better luck next time."
1,Isn't real life depressing enough?,"I have read all of Oprah's picks, have high regard for her opinion, but this book (and I read 3-4 books a week) is horrible. I was tempted tp put it down after the passage where Chip is smelling his couch for the place his last girlfriend had an orgasm while he was masturbating. This is beyond imagination. i suspect Mr. Franzwn is a sexually depraved pervert who is sharing his pathetic life with the world. If you are a serious lover of good literature, don't waste your time reading this book."
1,Another Depressing Novel from Oprah,"I saw Franzon emblazoned on the cover of Poets and Writers, so I bought the book. They called it ""THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL."" They were kidding, but as postmodernists, they're allowed to kid when it comes to ripping you off.The novel is depressing when not boring, and boring when not depressing. It starts nowhere, leaves you at the same place, and shows you nothing in-between.If the literary crowd ever wonders why nobody reads, why novels have been relegated to the fringes of modern civilization, it is because the novel has been rendered irrelevant by the con-artists and talentless middlemen who run the contemporary publishing show.It is complete waste of time and money, and yet one more product of the liberal hype machine.I have no idea who reads this and enjoys it, and most of the positive reviews read as if the publicity department wrote them.Read the classics, or the Bible, or check out Drake Raft for great modern literature."
2,I guess I am missing something,"This book was so critically acclaimed, I felt I had to read it. It was very hard to get into and rambled on and on. The chapters are too long to be reasonable. I felt I needed a good place to stop and there never was one. AND....it wasn't good enough to continue on, I had to stop! When I picked it back up, it was hard to remember what had happened. Franzen seems to want to be William Faulkner, with his long sentences. (he's not!) I didn't like it at all.If you haven't read it, DON'T."
2,The Male Danielle Steele,"I think Franzen has a lot of good ideas about family relationships/issues, but he should steer clear of writing about sexual concepts."
2,Style over substance,"I thought I was going to like this for the first 100 pages or so (lots of very funny stuff, though in need of some editing), until Chip hooked up with the Lithuanian. Then it got more and more long-winded and generally depressing. I'm glad I read a library copy."
2,Too Raw,"I read ""Corrections"" -- because Oprah recommended it, and I have read all her recommendations. But this book was too graphic and raw for me. I don't want to hear about a boy who had to sit for hours alone in the kitchen looking at his disgusting dinner, etc. Sorry. Disfunctionality is interesting, but I thought this book went a little too far."
1,This book is trash,"I strongly recommend that Mr. Franzen seek a mental health professional to work out his obvious dis-functions. I bought this book because of its ratings and reviews, and wish that I had not read it. I want my money back!!!!Neal Anderson, Spring, Texas"
3,Pretentious load of you know what!,"I read somewhere that Mr. Franzen believes his novels should be transforming. How can they be? He is one of those writers who is more interested in dazzling us with endless lists of newly minted metaphorical turns of phrase than he is in satisfying readers. Yes, there's a point somewhere in all this drivel, but you have dig through a load of metaphor and simile to reach it. There are so many words, I felt like the kid who digs through a pile of excrement to get to the pony that must be there somewhere. No wonder Oprah wanted this book for her show. All of her book club books share a distinctly bleak view of people. The Corrections does too. There's not one person who is the least bit likeable. As someone else here among customer reviews said, I wanted to like this book. Perhaps Mr. Franzen is an acquired taste."
2,I'm still depressed - weeks after reading this!!,"I'll make this short and sweet (bittersweet). Mr. Franzen is very talented in his descriptions of people, places and things. However -- this book has no soul, there wasn't a character I cared about, even though I tried and tried and tried!"
3,You really can't go home again,"Not an easy read, veering from riveting to tedious. The sound of grinding axes was occasionally deafening."
1,111 pages in and the book doth suck,"I can barely get through this book. It's awful. Go read ""Babbit"" instead. This book is going to the Strand where they'll probably use it to prop open the door."
1,Am I missing stomething?,"The characters are not likable, the story is boring, the writing, repititious--and he wins the national book prize! I could only read half of it, then skipped to the end. One reviewer wrote the mother somehow ""developed"". From what I read all characters were stuck and obnoxious and narcissistic. No thanks. Wouldn't want to spend time with any of these people or the book."
2,I really don't understand why people like this book so much?,I did not care for it at all. It does not have chapters and it switches from character to character at the drop of a hat. It is hard to follow and very scattered. It had a goood storyline but it just need to be sectioned up better. I don't think it should be called Amazon's book of the year at all. I have read many other books this year that definetly top this one.
3,Good Read,"I enjoyed reading the Corrections. The descriptions of the physical settings, family home, restaurant kitchen, cruise ship bring you right into the novel. I could almost smell the cooking and the dirt being tilled in the garden. The personalities of the family and how they relate to one another kept you reading. However, at the end I couldn't care less what happened to any of the family members. Perhaps it was all the hairs and warts being exposed or the raw apathy for the characters by the writer that made me, too care less about their fate."
2,An Exercise in Vocabulary,"I wonder if Jonathan Franzen had a thesaurus by his side as he was writing this book? It seems so - and he dipped into it a bit too often. While some may call this writing style ""poetic"", I found it to be heavy laden with obscure wording which did not move the plot forward in any meaningful way - and in some cases, provided an obstacle to that movement. The characters were difficult to like, the situations they found themselves in pathetic (if not mystifying as to purpose) and at book's end, I found myself wondering - ""So what was the point of telling that story?"" Admittedly, I read this book as it was recommended by Oprah Winfrey... Now that I've read it, I can't say I understand why she would recommend it... Not an enjoyable read..."
1,Boring and affected,"I am an avid reader and I cannot remember the last time I put down a book unfinished prior to the ""The Corrections."" I was sucked in by the Oprah Club hype. The book is *boring*. Every character is unpleasant, whiny and someone who I would avoid in the real world, assuming such caricatures could be found here. Franzen strikes me as an affected writer who sees no obligation to tell an engaging story - perhaps such concerns are beneath a modern author writing ""great literature."" I would recommend the book as a sleep aid but it is far too frustrating. More appropriate uses would be as a door stop (it goes on forever) or a toilet paper substitute."
5,The American epic.,"This book is really mostly amazing, and must rank just below Confederacy of Dunces as a masterful portrait of the American Disease."
2,"Should have been called ""The Amazing Run-On Sentence""!","There's an interesting story hiding somewhere in this book. Unfortunately, the 80 word sentences make finding it almost hopeless. Maddening to try and read: after a while, your eyes just scan the page to see if there are any periods!!!!!"
1,A Waste of Paper,"After all the great reviews in the literary press, I had so looked forward to reading this book. What a disappointment.The characters are beyond annoying. There isn't a single likable character in the whole bunch. And while there's certainly no requirement that you actually like the characters, it would make it easier to slog through this endless mess of a non-story.I haven't talked to a single person who raves about this book, but have heard from countless people who either finished it but hated it, or simply couldn't bear to read to the end.If you have plenty of time on your hands, insomnia, or just a desire to punish yourself, go pick it up at your local library. Otherwise, you'd be far more entertained by re-reading a real intellectual classic, like maybe The Cat in the Hat..."
2,Just OK,"The story is written well, but it works so hard to show that all is hopeless. I could never find anyone that I liked."
2,I Wondered What the Point of This Book Was,"I read this book as the monthly selection in my bookclub. None of the characters were even likable, although they were less dislikable by the end. I wondered what the point of this book was. These were all such disfunctional people that I wondered WHY the author would want to write so extensively about them! Did he come from a dysfunctional family himself, or has he known a lot of people from dysfunctional families? He certainly describes them in exacting detail. I didn't hate the book, but it is not one I would ever pick up on my own, or recommend to my friends."
1,read this book and waste your life...,"this is the first time i've ever reviewed anything on Amazon. the only reason i'm doing this is because i'm so frustrated after enduring 400 pages of this drivel and angry that so many reviewers would testify to this book being great.it seems almost a conspiracy to me that this book would garner such critical review. go read Russell Banks, Delillo or Kundera if you are looking for bleak brilliance."
3,Not one likeable character,"If you think you'd like reading about a dozen or so lazy, arrogant, feckless, stubborn, obsessive, often boring, and--finally--mentally ill characters, absent the companionship of a single protagonist, I suppose you've found your book."
1,Unreadable,"If this is high literary art, I must be missing something. This is one of the most tedious, overwritten family sagas I have ever read; I simply could not finish it. Try Christiana Stead's THE MAN WHO LOVED CHILDREN or Eudora Welty's THE OPTIMIST'S DAUGHTER. They are better examples of literary art, and are more satisfying by a mile. Once again, I find the richest examples of literary art on the backlists from which most publishers earn their bread and butter. Much better books were published last year, too, and were all but ignored."
2,One of only two books I never finished,"I believe this was on Oprah Winfrey's book list. Forewarned should have been forearmed, but alas, I did not heed my own better judgement. What a mistake that was. This has to be one of the most boring books I have ever cracked open and being an avid reader I have had my share of tedious writers. It sat around my home for a while until I put it in some box for a charity."
2,Nothing Special,"I read this book before I knew there was any hype about it. It wasn't a ""bad"" book, but I don't understand the hype that followed it. I found it merely average. There was nothing groundbreaking, nothing particularly insightful, nothing that I hadn't read before by better-written, more entertaining novels. Perhaps the ""controversy"" is less about the story itself but more about what happens when someone jumps on a bandwagon. As soon as it was hailed as a Great American Novel, people began to look for reasons to tear it down. I didn't find this story interesting enough to keep my copy... I left it at an airport for someone else to pick up. It wasn't even worth dragging back home to donate to my library. That's just my opinion, of course, but I'm not planning to check out anything more by Franzen... there are too many writers I enjoy to bother with this one."
1,Much Ado About Nothing,"This author does not know how to write a great novel but he has figured out how to promote one.....Terrible book but kudos to the advertisement campaign!At page 200, I finally said enough already!This book contains sentences that are almost a full page long but say nothing. Life is too short to waste any of it struggling through this story."
2,Underwhelming,"Although I finished the whole book, and found the little jacket blurb intriguing, I agree with many of the reviewers who felt it was underwhelming. Franzen doesn't seem to like many of his own characters, and it seemed like he decided to change his mind about Alfred's character (bluff hearty father in tragic disintegration or suburban monster getting his just due?) halfway through writing, for reasons that aren't entirely clear. I wasn't bored by the book, but I did get impatient; the characters behaved like sitcom characters, getting themselves into terrible messes that they should have seen coming. Some sections of the book were excellent, however; I enjoyed Chip's trip to the horrifically hip and overpriced Manhattan grocery store. Overall, there are a few good short stories sort of bunged into a big, slow book about American Life and its Empty Addictions. A lot of people hated it, too, but I feel that David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest was a better book on the same theme."
1,Worst book ever,"As I muddle through this horrific novel, I am trying to figure out why Oprah would recommend this trash. The only reasons that I can think of are the references to the bored housewife...where Enid wants to develop her children's intellect, but all she has are piles of dirty laundry. The characters in this book are all unlikeable, self-centered and self-absorbed. The author goes on such pointless tangents that I feel he must be like his characters. At one time in the book, Enid looks at Al and realizes that he is a ""bad, bad husband"". Well, this is a ""bad, bad"" book."
1,What a Mistake,"One of the worst books I have ever read. There were no redeeming features. It was as though the author decided to think of many of the ugly, pathetic, and sociopathic societal occurances and combine them with many/all the ugly, demeaning and undesirable traits people can have and put them into one book. What was the point? Sensationalism -- voyeurism -- how much will John Q. Public believe? This is the book of the century? I hope we haven't sunk this low in what we consider extaordinary literature!"
2,The Great American Novel?,"Everyone is calling this the great American novel, but I think you can only comapre it to The Grapes of Wrath. It is NOT a feel good book. No one is happy (probably why I kept hearing how ""real"" it is) and even though the author tries to brighten it up at the end a little, the whole book is so depressing that it is too little too late. It is compelling, and I did have a hard time putting it down, but do not read this if you are looking for an uplifting story."
2,Too depressing,Franzen is a good writer but I wasn't drawn to the family who is at the center of this story. The people are self-centered and unappealing in any way.
4,No Oprah!,I am glad to see an independent writer like Jonathan Franzen who is willing to turn down the endorsement opportunity from Oprah Winfrey. He's an author who doesn't need someone like Oprah to tell us he wrote a good book.
5,Book of the Decade,"Best book I've read in a long time. One of the main reasons I read is to discover why people do what they do. This book not only explains how these people end up being who they are, but does it in a most sophisticated and eloquent style. Unlike other snapshots of humanity, Franzen actually goes somewhere and finishes nicely."
2,Where was the editor?,"What a chore it was to read this ponderous book! I had to read a section, put the book aside for several days, and then soldier on through another section. It might have been an above average novel without the excessive treatment of various uninteresting subplots, most notably the pharmaceutical company and the Lithuanian business. It is at least 200 pages too long.Buried within it, however, is a good story about the relationship between modern-day, cosmopolitan children and provincial parents whose lives are crumbling. There are some memorable scenes and some great characters. Who can fail to sympathize with Enid, the mother, as she tries to bring one last ""normal"" Christmas to her family? The last section of the book, when Christmas finally arrives, is moving and well done.Was it worth it? Probably not. I just finished Sue Miller's latest offering, The World Below, and enjoyed it far more in much less time."
2,this is art?,"What was all the hype about? Women have been writing books about family dynamics for years (Edith Wharton, Jane Austen, Murasaki Shikibu's Tale of Genji, etc.) I think a man finally ventured into our realm and everyone got all excited. But too bad he had to tell it from such a manly, heartless point of view. None of the characters are likable. For a book to be enjoyable, we have to be able to sympathize with at least one character!?"
1,I would give it no stars if I could,"I am not going to say much about this book except that I hate it in a way that I have never hated a book before. For the life of me I cannot fathom how so many critics think so highly of this author. It is self absorbed, pretentious, un-funny garbage. The book feels like it was written by a teenager after two philosophy classes and about 20 MFA programs who oh so desperately needs to be told he is a genius. Mission accomplished: A talking turd for sure."
3,Almost Impossible to Review,"You know you're reading good writing, but oh what a painful reading experience it is. Just when you find a shred of empathy for a character, Franzen extinguishes it. Think Ordinary People, only you can't stand the (adult) children either. If you're miserable, this book will be good company. Otherwise, you'll want to wash your hands after each reading."
2,Unsavory,"I was offended by this book, yet at the same time I admire his writing, which is almost delicious with on-the-mark detail and dialogue that is natural, believable and interesting.However, you can sense the contempt the author feels toward his characters and he is as obsessed as his characters are with sexual things: acts, organs, smells, masturbation, adultery--all the things that make a modern novel hip, and I find tedious. The novel was too creepy to keep me interested and actually made me angry. I stopped reading after 70 pages."
3,Doesn't live up to the hype,"That Franzen is a brilliant person and gifted author is not in doubt. What is lacking in this book, however, is a reigning in of some of the voluminous information he gives out. Much of the writing that has little to do with the main characters serves only to bog down the reader and make the reader skip or skim pages altogether. Do I really care about Robin's background so much as to read pages upon pages about it? No. A page or two would suffice. Did we really need an expose on Lithuania to understand the events in Chip's life? Not really.In it's central study of a family falling apart and then coming back together again, this book excells. But I fail to see why this book garnered so much hype and critical praise."
3,An Underachiever,"This book has a great critical reputation and I've always enjoyed Franzen's essays in The New Yorker, so I was slightly disappointed with the novel. The story about a dysfunctional family coming together for one last Christmas is good foundation and there are several interesting characters in the book, but the style leaves a lot to be desired. Scenes hop around, the writing is disjointed and the narrative is often hard to follow. It seemed that Franzen was trying to be avant gard and hip, but the book loses a lot of its power because of this style. I would recommend reading it as a beach book, but it could have been much more and because it failed to live up to its promise I can't give it a great rating."
3,American Family Woes,"If you're already cynical about the state of the American family, this is a good book to read. My cynical summary: Mean dad gets his in the end with terrible disease but family is so messed up they don't see the irony in it. They only see their own selfish lives. Long-suffering wife finally gets her wish... to run her own life. How sad."
1,Just Plain Boring,"I was eager to start this book after all the hype I have heard, but am now at a loss as to what all the hype is about. I am only halfway through it and am bored stiff. I find the characters boring shallow and unlikeable. I will probably try to give it another couple of chapters before exchanging it for another novel."
1,the Corrections,"I am half way through this book and have put it down. I do not find anything very literary in a book which turns all characters into carricatures. Yes, there is wit, but where is the compassion that books similar to this show. This book has been compared to T.Mann's ""The Buddenbrooks"". No way, whereas Mann's characters allowed me to identify with them on some level, Franzen's Characters lack any depth. One cannot relate to them, they are so exaggerated."
3,So hard to review...,"This was one of the most difficult books I've ever gotten through. I couldn't decide if it was genius or just self-indulgent. It did make me laugh at parts and admire the satire; and at other times, depress me tremendously and make me question everything I say to my *own* kids. I think it's worth reading -- it's just so different from anything I've ever read before."
3,Disappointing,"After all of the ""hype"", I felt this book was a must. Jonathan Franzen is no doubt a gifted writer. Generally an interesting family story; at times fun, witty, insightful and intellegent. At some point, however, I just couldn't wait to finish the book. Just too depressing."
1,Terrible Book,I could not force myself to finish this book. The characters are so dysfunctional and depressing that I began to feel blue. This book in no way reflects my family or any family I know. I gave the book away. I read and liked most of the other Oprah selections.
1,Hours I Will Never Get Back,"I was determined to finish this, because I thought surely, with all of the praise it gets there must be a point somewhere. I thought wrong and 500 pages later I was left annoyed by a plotless story, gratuitous sex, and a host of bratty characters. This is by far the worst book I've ever read. If one should INSIST on reading it, I recommend starting at page 400, trust me, you won't miss a thing."
1,Boring,"There are alot of words in this book, but nothing being said. I read about 20 pages of this book. I was hoping the plot would pick up. Nope, same nothingness. I skipped ahead to see if the book would pick up later on. Nope. I put the book in a ""give away"" bag and picked out something else to read."
1,So bad it was awful,"Did I really read the whole book? I did. Steeped in mediocrity and blandness, I wish that I'd been warned. Each page was a struggle, an epic of endurance on the part of the reader. Drivvle to the umpth degree."
1,Save your money,"I bought this book at a book sale for $3 in Monroe CT, and reading the back cover, and reviews, I thought that it would be good. I read 1/2 of it so far, and found it to be dissappointing. It's depressing, it jumps around too much, and there's no plot. I found the book to be just plain weird. I thought that I was getting a bargain but I wouldn't have even paid 50 cents for it. I thought for a book this bad that even $3 was too high a price tag to pay. So please, save your money."
3,Kindle Prime borrowing library,Does anyone know how the Kindle Prime borrowing library works? How do i find a book? Is this book available through the lending library?
2,It's a lot like watching television,"I picked up this book after reading the author's article (in New Yorker) comparing himself to William Gaddis and insterting himself into the Gaddis, Pynchon, Barth, Delillo tradition. Sorry, but no.The Corrections is not a complete waste of time. The author is competent, but don't look to this novel for a really great literary experience. It's really a lot like watching television.In the author's article in the New Yorker, he references Barth's ""Sot-weed Factor"" as though it's some complex tome. It's not. You should read it instead of The Corrections."
2,"mmm, not that impressed","After seeing this on best selling lists forever, finally picked it up from my library. Liked the beginning, but it really waned. Made myself finish it since SO many people loved it, but I'm not feeling it."
4,"Some people just can't handle reality, apparently","This book is not for the weak, I suppose. Some people seem to be ""upset"" by it. That seems a very feeble response, to my mind. These are difficult people to know intimately, but I would not say that they are entirely unfamiliar. Franzen seems unafraid of the complexities that so many portrayals of family life either shy away from or reach for without grasping. I won't attempt to summarize what these are: he's a better writer than I. Read the book already."
3,A good concept badly executed.,"The Corrections tells the story of a family. Each section of the book is about one of the family members. At some point each persons story overlaps with the others. This is in interesting concept and there are some very good parts of the book. I mean this will definetly make your family seem normal in comaprison. The probmlem is each section is at least 100 pages. The book drags on for too long and often loses your intrest. If it was shortened to contain just the memorable parts it may have been much better. There was also one disturbing passage about the father who suffers from parkinsons, hallucinating about poop attacking him. Something i just dont care to read about."
1,yuck,"I almost always finish any book I start. Just shows some awards mean nothing, too awful to finish- A family of horrid people- doing nothing- Oprah liked this? Her only miscue!"
4,The Cover,"The Cover shows a table with incorrect table settings. Is this intentional?Loved the book, but kept looking at the cover and wondering why somebody didn't arrange the flatware properly."
4,Horribly Funny,"This book was a long read, but at least for me, that means that it was good. When it takes me a while to read it means I had to think about it. There are things in this book which really shouldn't be funny, but Mr. Franzen somehow turns around the laws of humor. If you would like to see how other peoples families might be more dysfunctional than yours I suggest you start here"
4,Read It. Period.,"I will be the first to admit that I had high expectations for Jonathan Franzen's work. What with the Oprah controversy and the National Book Award honors, I expected this to be a striking piece of literature.While it's definitely not one of those striking pieces of genius that shatters the reader to the core, it is definitely a brilliant work. The Corrections has a way of gripping you tightly, as it explores the inner-workings of individuals that Franzen very carefully explores. It's one of those novels that holds on and won't let go.Is it as pretentious as Franzen seems? Probably. But does that diminish it's value? Not at all."
2,NOT worth the effort,"I had such high hopes for this book. The next ""great American novel"". The last 2 chapters were by far the best, although I have to say not worth the preceding 450 pages. The characters were developed to varying degrees of completeness such that by page 567 I was still being surprised by their actions. I couldn't bear to finish the thing in one reading and had to stop in the middle for a rest. Get the thing on tape or ask a friend about it. Too heavy to carry around for what it winds up being worth."
1,A lot of ballyhoo,"I just don't get it. This is NOT a good book. Some fine marketing, coupled with the whole 'Oprah Incident' did great things for sales, but sales and a ton o' press do not a good book make. I say to all who are considering picking this one up: Don't bother."
2,Not For Me,"This is a long read with only a few interesting parts along the way. The characters are not at all likable, which is what the author intended, I think. This book brings to light lots of flaws people commonly have. I don't enjoy reading about unhappy people with such characture-like unpleasant personalities. If you enjoy books with a very negative outlook on life, this one may be for you."
5,Franzen novel,"Since the passing of David Foster Wallace, Franzen is the best American novelist today.This book is a joy to read."
4,"Well written, but a little on the long side","It describes a malfunctining family - in great detail, with great sympathy, great humor, and with a feeling of 'true'.Only problem is it sometimes is too long, with too muc internal deliberation, and too little actual action (for my taste).Undoubtedly a very good book by a very talented writer."
3,The only reason I finished the book----,"is because I paid for it.Although I am probably in the minority, I found the book to be entirely too *wordy*...too many allegories, too much description.I felt that the author wandered off on tangents many times, instead of staying with a particular story-line/topic.I so wanted to like this book, too....The characters were just barely tolerable, especially *nasty*was Gary's CHEAPNESS with his own mother. I mean---did he reallyNEED to be paid back the few dollars for his own father'sshower materials? He pouted about how *his* time was worth money,too. So pathetic (imho).Imagine having a child that ungrateful as to be expected tobe paid back for doing his own parent's a small favor.(I'd hate to think what the cost would be for Gray if his mothercharged HIM for all the *favors* she has done!)That was just one example (of the many) un-likable features ofthe characters."
3,Needs Some,"I did finish this rather overlong equally overwritten family epic. Yes,Franzen can write. However,he rambles on too much, The ""talking turd"" hallucations experienced by the family patriach being an example of a rather funny concept milked dry. I mean,it was at least 10 pages too long! Also,none of the family,with the exception of Enid, was(to borrow from the author) really,really,really all that likeable. They all came across as rather self-absorbed and annoying. I, personally, didn't get much out of this book,but others might. So again,don't be put off by my opinion."
3,No sympathetic characters makes this a tough read.,"Franzen's descriptions of people and everyday events are some of the best that I have read in recent years. Many times I feel that ""click"" as I read his words, knowing EXACTLY what he is talking about.That said, the problem I have with this book is that none of these characters have any redeeming value. While Franzen does an excellent job of showcasing the minute flaws that make up our everyday characters, he doesn't show any of the positive aspects of human nature at all. The end result is a grim tale of how families go wrong.This is a very dark view of life and Franzen never lets up on that theme, making this a depressing and dreary read. If you like reading for the sake of reading and don't invest yourself in the characters, by all means, read The Corrections. Otherwise, go elsewhere."
2,Get over yourself Franzen..you are good but not THAT good..,"I was really, really, looking forward to this book. I thought, by reading some of the reviews that this guy was going to be clever beyond clever.But in reality, this book is overwritten, to the point of absurdity. This guy makes Cormac Mcarthy look like Robert Fulghum.I didnt like the fact that the characters were not believable, and in some cases that would be fine..but in a book about the craziness of family, I have to really be into the characters. I also find it hard to take authors that are just to cool for the rest of us. He tries to hard to let us know that he is a smart alec..elitist, know it all.This one was not for me."
5,Decide for yourself ...,"The book was difficult to read in one respect: it was so easy to see parts of myself in several of the characters, details that I didn't think anyone on Earth would guess or suspect about me, that at times it became incredibly disconcerting to read. But then I realized, hey! J. Franzen isn't writing about me, this is fiction! Any book that can get under my skin like this one did deserves the term brilliant. But I will admit that it's not for everyone. For me it was the best thing since ""Prince of Tides"" and ""A Prayer for Owen Meany""."
2,Franzen repetes himself,"After all the hype I thought I was in for a great read. I wasn't. Franzen writes no better in this novel than in his others. Obtuse, ponderous and dull. One moves from scene with the prolixity of a snail. It is a work that is touted for it's humor and well draw characters. I blink my eyes -- where in heaven's name are they? It's a rambling, cluttered novel that has been over sold with heavy advertising and precious reviews. Help yourselves, my friends, to my share of it."
1,Not impressed,"I am on a list at my library for this, but may cancel. Have just read the excerpts here and I find the writing dreadful! From what is presented, I don't care to know more about these people. I don't care what happens to them."
2,Dysfunctional Family,"I was promised a tragic masterpiece, grandly entertaining, wisecracking, eloquent, heartbreaking beauty. What I got was a tiresome story about truly dysfunctional people who I would never want to associate with, so why waste my time reading about them? You guessed it -- I didn't like this book and I only got through half of it before opting to read something I'd enjoy. With all the literature out there, why spend precious time with annoying people you can't stand?"
1,My experience with this book,"1. Heard that it was a masterpiece2. Found it at the library4. Took it home5. Opened it6. Read the first sentence7. Realized it was not a sentence,but a sentence FRAGMENT8. Closed book9. Took it back to the library"
2,big talent -- very little heart,"Normally, if I get more than a few hundred pages into a novel, I finish it, but this (and A Man in Full) are the only 2 exceptions I can recall. I used to like books where the author hated his characters and the whole thing was seeing how much humiliation and physical pain he could subject them to, but nowadays I need to have some molecule of concern about the people I'm reading about. With the characters in this book, they could have lived happily ever after or been blown up by a bomb and it wouldn't have made the slightest bit of difference to me. By the time I was reading about the doctor on the ocean liner, I realized I didn't care, it didn't feel worth my time, and it even felt bad for my soul. So I quit reading it. I figured a happy ending would have felt tacked on and fake and a depressing ending would just be more of the same. Franzen's a wicked good writer, and there's lots of funny, beautifully-observed stuff in this novel, but it's a cold fish."
2,Verry boring,I am only half way throu this book and am struggling to even finish it. I ussually think Oprah does a super job on her picks but I can't imagine why she would pick this. Chip and Gary's stories are soso but wading through the stuff on the cruise with Enid and her husband put me to sleep. ... Shall I finish it5???? I'm glad I didn't buy it. I read It is up for yet another award!! HElp me.
2,The Corrections? May as well be anything!,"I found reading a 24+ line sentence in the very beginnning very off putting. The ""t***"" sequence on the cruise ship held no weight to the popular theme of cashing in on the old man's patent. I found the characters to be deep and binding: however, the longevity and ""family dysfunction"" too much Oprah for me. I congratulate the author for opposing his work to the Oprah circuit. He is a good writer and if left alone, will produce great works. Isn't it time for Oprah to move beyond the oppressed and empowered genre? Our book group is sick of her selections."
2,Don't Go There,"This book was suggested for our bookclub because of the book critics review. However, not one of the twenty members of our club could even finish this book. A waste of time. The characters were uninteresting, did not capture anyones attention and the chilren were unbelievable. We are located in St. Louis and some of us knew the authors family. Where he got his characters remain a mystery to us. Boring and depressing."
3,Worth a read,This story moved a tad bit slow for me although I appreciated the issues covered in this novel. Good writing style. Very much worth taking a read and deciding for yourself.
2,Five years and I'm Still bitter...,"About the three nights and 25 dollars I wasted on this overhyped, misanthropic, nasty, credulity-straining and worse, unfunny piece of literary detritus. The few mean-spirited chuckles you'll get are unworthy of you, whoever you are. Unless Donald Rumsfeld is reading this."
1,Trite,"longwhinded, boring, moorish. Unsympathetic characters with a male-orinted, egotistical point of view. Blech."
2,Ignore the Hype,"The book jacket hyped this as, ""Wildly brilliant,funny and wise."" I kept waiting for the ""funny"" and ""wise."" Am still waiting after finishing the book."
2,Who will correct The Corrections?,I found this book disappointing. What is all the fuss about? The few truly comic bits do not compensate for a sprawling novel about highly detestable people in ridiculously unrealistic situations. A waste of time.
1,A WASTE OF TIME FOR MANY...I MUST ASSUME,"This books is creating responses from winning the Nat'l. Book Award to throwing it away in the dump; that is being extreme.I must state I read more non-fiction than fiction, but am always eager for a good story. With the ballyhoo I have read about how wonderful ""The Corrections"" is I had to get it and started reading last night (11/14). I have read up to page 55. Normally I will not quit a book until I have read at least 100 pages to ""give the story a chance,"" but after reading the critiques in Amazon, I will not waste my time further by trying the next 45 pages.This is a depressing, non-interesting story...and who needs that after Sept. 11th? I normally don't write reviews on a book I either dislike or read a few pages, but due to the accolades given THE CORRECTIONS I had to put in my two cents worth."
2,Long winded,I picked this book up with much anticipation and in the end felt great diappointment. I found it overblown and long winded. This story could have been told in so fewer words and with more empathy. The characters were good and worthy of the story being told.
5,A momentus achievement,I have not been so singularly moved by a novel since Rushdie's Midnight's Children. The characters in this book are so beautifully flawed and their situations so relatable it became at times impossible to distinguish their suffering from that of my own.This book taught me things about myself and my relationships that no previous novel has come even close to touching upon. I simply cannot recommend it enough.
3,"Okay, it's real ""literature,"" but not a page-turner","I can see why this book has received such acclaim, as it is very thought-povoking, descriptive and well-written. However, I didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped, and it took me awhile to get through it. The characters were all so un-likable, that I couldn't really warm to this book or get attached to anyone in this pathetic family. The pitiable Enid and Alfred were the most likable and that's not saying much. The book didn't really delve into how the three children might have been raised to make them turn into such selfish, sniveling, un-compassionate jerks. I mean, the parents seem annoying, but that's hardly reason for the kids to be so rotten. This being said, I still enjoyed the book, but then, I enjoy a lot of books. Most of them more than this one."
1,Sometimes sloppy is just sloppy.,"This guy belongs on Oprah. Or somewhere worse than Oprah. I mean, it's a book that plays to the worst cliches of TV melodrama, the lowest common denominator. That it is considered a ""literary"" book tells you just how sorry is the state of things literary. Tell you what--go to the store. Read the 1st chapter standing there. If, having read chapt 1, you want to buy it, well, more power to you. It gets better, too, after chapter 1, but it has so far to go. Too far. Buy something else."
2,Wake me up when it's over.,"I was drawn in by the first chapter. Loved the writing. After that, the minutia and the repetition became painful. This would have been a much better book at about 1/2 the existing page count. It reminds me a lot of slower Dickens novels. (Throughout his career, was paid by the word. They haven't started doing that again, have they?)Franzen is a good writer, but if, in my opinion, he wants to appeal to a broader audience, he needs to tighten up his prose."
3,And so the hype was because....,"I still can't figure out what the buzz was all about (besides the O brouhaha). I could connect with Gary, Chip, and Denise on some level (must be the middle age hurdles and Philly/NY elements). But I could hardly champion them. Every time the plot rambled on about the patent, Alfred's slow demise, or some pathetic turn of a relationship-gone-bad, I wished I knew how to speed-read. I think there's literary merit in the novel, but it's too overdrawn and shoots into too many directions. I wouldn't prefer root canal to reading this (as one reviewer suggested), but I would've liked a stronger focus."
1,Ridiculous...what an arrogant person....,"I read this book, but felt is was intended for an intellectual to read and not the average person who frequents Oprah's books. It was a difficult read and many phrases and words were difficult to understand or apply. I did not like it at all and gave it to my public library. I am currently reading A Beautiful Mind, it's a difficult book to get through but 100% more interesting."
3,The Corrections needs some correcting,"This is not one of my favorites of Oprah's choices. The characters are interesting, although the focus tended to be on the characters I was least interested in. I found the book a little choppy and just as I was getting into a story (especially of the son and his wife), Franzen went elsewhere. I found the daughter's character a little inconsistent...I'm not sure how to explain that one...The parents were not delivered in enough depth to make me feel any empathy for them.I kept turning the pages, and it was good, but there were gaps in the flow of the book."
1,What's the big deal about this book??,"I really do NOT understand why this book has been called ""exhilarating"" and ""spellbinding"". I started reading it from the beginning and was completely bored. So I skipped a few chapters, started reading again, and found myself extremely unimpressed. A few chapters more, and I had to give up. I just could not get into the book, and actually looked forward to putting it down! What a disappointment. I'm amazed it made it onto best-selling lists/"
1,Not for me,"Bought this on recommendation of the 5 star reviews but unfortunately found myself on the other end of the opinion curve: characters totally cardboard and drawn from cliches without sympathy or insight. Kept asking why the author wrote this book, whatever was the point? Definitely not to be read if looking for intelligence, wit, lyricism or even gritty glimpse of some reality. Nothing here but the author's passing time on his keyboard without any due diligence."
1,Intolerably depressing,"I had this book on my shelves for years, moved households twice with it, always regarded it with what seemed like an unjustified suspicion. Finally began reading it, having run out of other books. My suspicion was justified! Even though it's impressively crafted, I simply couldn't stand these characters and their unrelieved desperation (with the possible exception of Gary's youngest son, Jonah, who loves reading Prince Caspian, but even he is pilloried as a reflexive people pleaser). I gave up after 200 pages, put it away, and felt cleansed... like someone who'd escaped the company of a dysfunctional drug addict. What a bleak, horrid novel."
5,We Must Be Siblings!,"I had ""The Corrections"" sitting on my bookshelf for several years before I finally picked it up and decided to read it. I took it on a vacation to read while sitting on a beach soaking up the sun. The book is a long one and at times difficult to get through. Then it hit me...this book is all about MY family. Yes, I strongly think that Jonathan Franzen is my sibling. The family he writes about was so familiar to me that at times the book made me feel uncomfortable, but I loved it. The story is quirky, depressing, real, but often funny. Parts of the story is so funny that it surprised me when my laughs came out of nowhere. I would love to see this book made into a movie."
2,A Disappointment,"I was initially quite eager to read the The Corrections. My bookclub is reading it this month so it seemed an ideal way to enjoy a modern novel. Unfortunately, I have not had the rave respose to the book, or to the story for that matter, that every one else seems to have. Yes, it's a well-written story. But in no way does it soar to great or hilarious literary heights. In fact I found much of the story to be long-winded, plodding and somewhat depressing. For this kind of 30-something angst (I myself am 30-something) I would turn to ""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius"" by Dave Eggers, or if you really want to have a laugh at dysfunctional families try books by Ann Tyler, John Irving, Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Dostoyevsky. It's not the worst book I ever read but by no means is it the best."
2,"Not for the faint of heart, or the caring","A book whose characters fail to get inside my head is always a disappointment. Dysfunctional families can be fascinating but this family fails to come up with one person who makes me care what happens to him/her. Some of the realities of Parkinsons are well and truly portrayed, but I kept reading hoping to find some crumb of insight that would be a hook. It was a Book Club assignment and to most of us it felt like homework. Some never finished it. One or two actually enjoyed it. I considered my completion of the read as a major victory in perseverence, but this story does not linger in my head."
3,What's the big deal ?,"I was disappointed with The Corrections. Maybe it was the hype, or all the advance press about how brilliant the book was going to be, but it seemed unfocused to me. There were characters that seemed lost or missplaced, as if they had hoped to get a short story or novel to themselves, and instead got crammed in with everyone else. This is supposed to be a story about a family, but there was so little about the family as a group, that I never really understood the bitterness some of the characters felt. I'd say that all in all, this could have made a fine long short story, novella, or short novel. There was too much stuff packed in there, as if Franzen thought that the length of the book would add credibility. It was a story told without much sensitivity, pathos, appreciation for suffering....rather cold and self-indulgent. I'd rather read Alice Munro."
5,Worth the hype,"Although I read and enjoyed Franzen's ""The 27th City"" several years ago, I put off reading The Corrections for a long time. The story just didn't sound interesting to me. However, after years of reading positive reviews for the book, I gave in and read it..... And, it was amazing. It's a hilarious and heartwarming look at one not-so-normal American family that is perhaps becoming closer to what the new ""normal"" American family is.This is one novel deserving of all the hype it received."
1,Why?,"Franzen has a gift, stringing sentences of great detail into paragraphs that are relatable to the reader.However after reading the first 50 pages I thought, why am I spending my precious time engaged in the disfunction's of a midwest family when I have already ""been there, done that!"" And my own experiences tower over any folklore Franzen could spin. Read it if you enjoy wallowing away in depression, unending turmoil and a story that is very SLOW to start."
2,Not worth all the hype - not at all,"I think this book, despite a few amazingly beautiful sentences and commentaries on humanity, is a self-indulgent piece of crap. I FORCED myself to finish it because of all the hype, because so many people spoke well of it. That was no easy task, nor did I ever feel that the effort paid off. Boring, solopsistic, (and once again) SELF INDULGENT. Yuck."
3,Almost worth it if you're Nordic!,"The only funny parts in this book are the conversations that take place on the Scandanavian cruise ship between 2 main characters (man and wife) and other couples from Sweden and Norway. Of Danish descent, I laughed out loud at these couples' boorish efforts to somehow communicate with one other. It's a frivolous hell, and the writer puts you right in there. Why is it that just about every modern novel has to have a corporation as a supporting character? Given the current world situation, I salute the author for trying to find something funny about what's left of the personal life."
2,Great prose but not much cohesion to the story,"This book sounded very promising at the start, the first few chapters, then began to fall apart without taking the reader along. My mother sent it to me and I wouldn't recommend it for her to read. It has graphic language that doesn't seem to fit in and doesn't seem to have a real purpose. The author comes across as being very impressed with himself for putting together brilliant sentences and prose and saying a lot in a small space, otherwise, it's a wash that doesn't hold together in any way. It is simplistic, banal at times, and although he is quite good at putting ideas on paper, they don't come together in any powerful way. When I finished the book I was disappointed, hoping for a meaning of some sort that pulled it together. Wally Lamb far outdoes this writer in ""This Much I Know Is True"", for example, but I will probably read this writer if he writes another novel, but definately wait until it is in paperback."
2,Command of Language but not Substance,"Franzen has a command of language. He is able to show and not merely tell, but what is he trying to show us? Other reviews suggest that it is too depressing. I do not see that this is a criticism. I enjoy art form that is capable of making one feel. That is where this, and many other novels fail. The characters are unoriginal, and pathetic. Where Franzen fails is in his artistic vision. He is unimaginative and lacks a connection to the eternal. This book is a book of a certain place and time. It is not timeless, and for this I find Mr. Franzin is without inspiration, and is uninspiring."
2,Quit after about 100 pages.......,"I found many parts of this book interesting and bold. But it wore me out! I got this book shortly after 9/11/01 and simply found it required way too much concentration that I don't have right now. Maybe I could swallow this one better if I had huge chunks of free time and the quieter state of mind this book would require from me. I find paragraphs that are a page long (and there are many) simply too dense for my taste on a good day. Mr. Franzen, less is more."
4,THE CORRECTIONS,"The book is beautifully written. However, as a 66 year old grandmother with many of the same problems I found it very sad and depressing. It just confirms that the problems of senior citizens and family relationship are becoming a sad fact of life. I wish he had been able to express all of the angst that this family goes through with a more upbeat turn of events. Also found the chapters with all the gobbly gook about ingredients for the ""cure"" totally unnecessary. When he wrote about the human relationships it was very touching.I want to recommend this book to my senior bookclub, but I am reluctant to do so. I don't think they need to dwell on how we are disappointed by family. A truthful book, but sad."
1,Composition 101,"The Corrections was hard to read, because J.G. tried to use too much research, too many obscure words, too many incomplete sentences, and sentences that were too long. Except for the father, the characters were unsympathetic and never seemed to learn from their mistakes. A little improvement was shown in that regard toward the end of the book, but it was too little too late. It is surprising to me that this book has received the acclaim that it has."
1,"Sorry John, maybe next time","This book did have potential, but unfortunaly feel quite short. The biggest problem with this book is that I hated all of the characters. This book is compared with Anne Tyler - which for the quirkiness aspect of the characters has some merrit - but with each of her characters we find ourselves LIKING them and able to empathise. Here, the characters were all dispicable whiny annoyances."
1,Get serious drugs before starting this book,"I, like many others, thought that this book would be great. The cover (in this case you SHOULD NOT judge a book by) made me think that I was going to read something wholesome and heartwarming. NOT!!!! This book was too long, and too boring! I finished it last night and I am still depressed! I know that I could have writen a better book about my husbands family with my eyes closed! This family is awful. While reading you really want to find something/anything to like about them -- but you can't!!...This book is in terrible need of many many Corrections! Cutting down from 568 pages to half of that would be a great place to start! I'm sorry Oprah, I hated it!"
2,"Over-written, pretentious ...","After the Oprah hoopla, I was more than excited to read this book. I mean, Jonathan Franzen ... off Queen Midas herself! It must be great! Down with the man, and all that. Then I picked it up. I got 75 pages in, and thought it was the most self-absorbed, smarmy drivel ever. It reeked of creative writing students out to prove their cool factor and indie cred. David Foster Wallace you are not, so really, Mr. Franzen, could you just spit it out?"
1,The triumph of Marketing over substance,This is a very disappointing novel! The writing does not live up to the hype. I read a beautiful short piece by Jonathan about his father having alzheimers disease which was very evocative and poignant but to read the corrections maks me realise that he is not a natural writer. The first 50 pages are excrutiatingly 'forced'and I could barely finish the book. Really this is a run-of-the-mill soap opera. De Lillo he aint!
3,The Corrections,What might have been extraordinary reading was exhaustible instead. While normally a quick reader I took months to complete this story. The fast paced concentrated writing led me to wonder if this were the work of the overly anxious or the chemically induced. I would hope for the latter. Overall the story earned the time it took to complete.On a footnote let me just say from personal experience that a slower midwestern life exists in my memory from this particular era.
5,wow,"I came to The Corrections having read Strong motion by Franzen before. I found Strong motion excellent workmanship but too much attempting to please on the content side. Irritating.Reading the Corrections I can't help getting the feeling that Franzen has evolved into a truly great author. Even if the content has less big events than Strong Motion it seems timeless in a manner that Strong motion could never dream of. There is something genuinely disturbing about the story that I couldn't get enough of (when one of the main characters is bullied by his wife for being depressed, I could feel my own depression creeping in... Disturbing. As a great novel should be). I would easily put The Corrections on my Top 10 list, it is my best read since Underworld."
1,YUCK!!!!!,"I have read most of the ""Oprah"" books and have generally liked, or at least, found them thought provoking. This is one of the worst books I have read in some time. If the author's objective was to make sure you disliked his characters he has prevailed triumphantly. I found no sympathy, no caring and little compassion for these nasty people. We all have some of these people in our families and in ourselves, but this took all these flaws to extreme. The only reason I finished this book was I thought it must get better to get the reviews it had (...) I don't even have the heart to let anyone borrow this book to read."
4,"Comic, ironic","To those readers who complained about the book being 'depressing' - perhaps you shouldn't read 'Anna Karenina'. I don't rate this novel as highly as Tolstoy's but it is a great novel of manners; a snapshot of how people in the US try to deal with the old problems of what to do with all they have, why it doesn't seem to add up to enough, and mortality. Style is maybe a bit too clever, self-conscious (like David F Wallace can be)but very captivating and well-drawn characters."
1,A crashing bore,"I made a pledge to myself some years ago never to read more than the first 50 pages of a book I can't stand. I broke my promise with The Corrections, unfortunately. What a bore! Nat'l Book Awards Board, what were you thinking? Oprah, what were you thinking? There is absolutely no compelling reason why this book is getting such rave reviews. And note that none of those reviews can state the book's theme. Perhaps, as I believe, because there is none. This book was the biggest waste of my reading time in several years."
5,Spectacular Honesty,"The magic of this book lies not so much in its plot as in its honesty about human nature. The condition of each member of the Lambert family is catalogued in a series of rationalizations they have made to adjust to a life they otherwise don't understand. An honest reader will recognize these voices as their own, those of friends and loved ones, those of bosses and other authority figures. I would be hard pressed to think of another book that so captivated me in recent years. Perhaps Roth's AMERICAN PASTORAL or Steinbeck's EAST OF EDEN. This chronicle of dramatic inner and inter conflict and turmoil in the context of the most mundane (and some not so) of events is destined to be a book that is talked about long after Franzen, may he live to be very very old and happy, is gone."
5,"Not for everyone, but definitely for me","When I first read this book I immediately agitated for my friends to pick it up. I soon found it's not for everyone. Some would set it aside part way through and while others couldn't put it down and loved it.I'm not sure why it's so polarizing, but my own appreciation comes from the strong characters and the weaknesses each struggles with. I both despised and admired each character, and somehow forged quite an attachment to them. I saw a little of each of them in myself.Definitely read this before Freedom, which felt rushed and underdeveloped."
1,Had to put it down,"A dreary, complaining story filled with whining, self-obsessed caricatures. ""Exhilarating"" or ""spellbinding"" it is NOT. Save your money."
1,pretentious hype,"Why do we torture ourselves by reading books like The Corrections? Are we masochists who enjoy having our native tongue mangled until it is a souless corpse? I could barely get through the first page of this book without a burst of hysterical giggles at how pretentious and bloated the language is. The author spends several paragraphs in the first few pages of the book describing the characters' internal alarm without making one original observation (""an overlay of overtones"" and other such nonsense.) Yet this book receives rave reviews from the critics while better written genre fiction is panned for being clear and having characters one can actually sympathize with. The only thing a book like this can teach us is how to write badly."
2,So so,"I like the idea of connecting emotional life with the irony of a Don DeLillo or a David Foster Wallace, but I don't think the writing needs to be so pretentious. Those who are bored with Corrections might want to take a look at Anne Ursu's novel Spilling Clarence. It has the pomo sensibility, but the sentences are crisp and the story compelling enough to read in one sitting. Of course it is written by a woman, so the ability to put feeling and intellect on the page isn't quite so buzz worthy."
1,"Overrated, overhyped","This is quite possibly one of the worst books I've read in a long time. I can only think of one other book I refused to finish, but this may be the second. The reviews call it ""funny, moving, generous."" I find it nothing but annoying. There is nothing sympathetic about any of the characters, who all need a good smack up side the head. While all families are dysfunctional, I don't believe any family is truly this [messed] up. The New York Observer says its ""unbearably lifelike."" If this reflects family life in the U.S., god help us! It must have been a bad year for books if this one won the National Book Award."
1,The emperor has no clothes.,"I am writing this online (lazy) so forgive the typos, poor grammar, spelling errors, etc.Reading ""The Corrections"" is like making love to an extremely obese woman whom I just met in a dark bar late at night, and to whom I would never introduce my friends.I feel dirty and ashamed, and I want out of here very badly.Okay, so I was drunk and horny, but that is no excuse for my behavior.As a novelist myself, I have no problem writing the inspired part of my story, which we can call the ""meat"". The problem I have is writing the ""fat"" needed to fill out the story to publishable volume.I admit that Jonathan Franzen is a ""talented"" writer. I admit I finished reading ""The Corrections"". But I feel, in having done so, like I had to gorge on a ton of fat to get to half a kilo of meat.""serious fiction""? Excuse me, I have to go force myself to vomit now."
2,What's the big deal?,I can't believe I am seeing this book listed as the best book of 2001. It wasn't the worst book I've ever read but best of the year?? Come on! I read 3 other books in the midst of struggling through the first half of this one. It certainly wasn't Important or Thought-Provoking in the least.
2,Self Aggrandizing Drivel,"Who cares? Maybe the most overhyped book I have ever read. I was so looking forward to it, and was so disappointed. I love a well written tragedy, and this was not it. Not well written at least. I won't buy Franzen's next book."
2,depressed after I finished it,"The way the book is told is kind of confusing, the part about the parents I thought was slow and hard to get through, lots of technicalities that I didn't find interesting. I missed the storyline and the personal message of the book. The end was so depressing that I through it in the corner after finishing it and was mad at my friend for telling me its a good book. It didn't touch me like many other books have. Despite all this though it is greatly written in detail with lots of research involved."
1,How About ZERO Stars?,"Ah, heck! I don't even want to rate this book, because I didn't read it. I didn't want to. Now I don't need to. You know why? Because I'm going to write this book. And do it better than what'shisface. And a year from now, you'll be reading all the mean things people have to say about the *newest* Great American Novel.Thomas Pynchon my little pink FOOT!"
1,Where Is Ernest Hemingway?,"After reading thru this new novel by Jonathan Franzen, all I can say is give me some Ernest Hemingway, instead of this overblown, long-winded bit of bitter for the sake of bitter. Mr. Hemingway wrote a precise sentence and told a story one could enjoy... not Mr. Franzen. Go find a good read and avoid ...."
2,typical,"I can't believe I finished this book. The writing was synthetically verbose, the characters and I'm assuming the writer are arrogant, bitter and shallow. I've never heard more dribble about fashion, and the right vintage car, and the hippest restaurants, and the 'best' writers. There must be a how-to one could buy: ""A Midwesterners guide on how to become urbane"" It's a cliche."
2,Why didn't I like this book?,"There was so much praise for this book I actually felt guilty for not enjoying it. Then I kinda got mad at myself and the book. I mean it's not a bad book, I kinda like Franzen writing, it just seemed to go nowhere. The middle class angst, the dysfunctional family, the oh so flawed characters. It's as if Franzen took all the latest ""hip"" themes and just mixed 'em all up like some big bowl of Jello fruit salad. Now, I enjoy Jello fruit salad, I love the way it looks, and I'll always have a bite or two, but I can't stomach nearly 600 pages of Jello fruit salad."
2,Excellent read they say? Correction!,"After reading excellent reviews for ""The Corrections"", I pre-ordered this book from Amazon.com and very much looked forward to reading it. When Oprah chose it as one of her selections, my enthusiasm only increased. Alas! This book is torture to read. Each sentence drags on with overly poetic, overly detailed, overly worded prose. Each character a pathetic and uninteresting bore (who really cares about these people??). Midwesterners deserve a better description than this book has to offer. Trust me when I advise you not to use your hard earned money on this one. Borrow the book from a library or a friend (she'll probably be happy to fish it out of the recycle box)."
1,Not worthy of the hype,"My mother-in-law read the book and did not highly recommend it. This should have been a red flag of warning to me since she has recommended some gems to me over the years. But I took it and read it anyway.Maybe it is honest writing, but the writing just seemed to me so in love with itself, or the author was so in love with himself. My family was dysfunctional in a variety of ways, and yet I could not empathize with any of the characters in this book. Why does writing like this garner such literary accolades? I thought it was overlong and I was not impressed overall especially with the ending.Not only has this author shunned and insulted all of Oprah's reading fans, his novel has now turned me off as well."
1,Everyone in a 12 woman book club hated this book.,"Our local women-only book club is entering its third year. For good or bad, most of the books we've read are Oprah books. Only one book brought about much hostility, The Corrections. In fact, I think only two people read the entire book; the others simply couldn't read the entire thing. Sure, there is great character development -- too bad we couldn't stand one single character. We discussed it over one year ago and it still comes up during each bi-monthly meeting. Usually, someone has come up with a new idea on what to do with the book -- fire starter, white elephant gift, etc."
1,"words, words, words","I read about half way through this book and then skimmed the rest. I just didn't care about any of the characters (I really tried!) and got tired of all the endless words. Underneath all the endless words it seemed there was a great plot and great characters that would grab me from time to time, but then I would get bogged down again. Maybe this book will make a good movie..."
2,"Depressing, stream-of-conciousness waste of time","I was really looking forward to reading this book, even prior to the Oprah hoopla. I had read so many wonderful reviews. However, I found it drudgery from page 1. The ""sly humor"" mentioned in the literary reviews I found to be obvious and not really that funny. Perhaps I'm missing out on the so-called ""brilliance"" of his writing, but while I found the depth of the characters interesting, I couldn't help but feel that Franzen had simply taken his character outline and fattened it up for the novel. I found the character of Denise the most interesting, but it was definitely a portrait from a male perspective; and the ""redemption"" of Chip at the end seemed too contrived and easy. I do give Franzen credit for making me ""feel"" for these characters, though. They are a sad, depressing lot. I muddled through to the end, but never have I been so glad to finish a book! Don't believe the hype."
2,The writer is too visible,"I like a transparent author, one who disappears as his or her story takes shape. Think of Steinbeck in _Of Mice and Men_ or Wally Lamb in _I Know This Much is True_ or a host of others. Franzen is unwilling to get out of the way. He works hard to show that he's clever, to demonstrate that he's a great writer. Each of the demonstrations stands in the way.I went to a reading of Tobias Wolff's a few years back. He read some stories from his collection _The Night in Question_. I had read each of them before and, as he read, I was re-reading them again. His voice was simply the carrier, just as his writing voice was the carrier when I read them on my own. I picture Franzen reading his work in a too-loud shirt, with a voice that calls attention to his reading, and with asides and smiles throughout.All in all, it felt like a proud writer trying to show off. I wasn't carried away by it. There was too much writer and too little writing there."
1,ITS NOT NEW,"OK, we heard about this for months and I couldn't wait so I bought it as an eBook before publication. And I am glad I got it so inexpensively. While I found this book interesting and fast moving it is certainly NOT the great American novel as hyped (I reserve that nomenclature for books like Dreiser's An American Tragedy). Between movies and other similar novels, let's face it...we have heard this stuff before. I found it only momentarily moving, most of the characters to be flat, and the ending...what a jolt with no real prior motivation. In all honesty, this was a WHINING book with no meaning for our society. SO much better has been written over the years by other authors that I wonder why the hype here. The attempt at relating the demise of our often greedy culture was naive at best, and after the fact as we are living it now. I will quickly forget this one."
1,The Worst!!,"I had so looked forward into diving into a big, thick novel on the hilarity of family disfunction. As one who will finish a book 99% of the time, regardless of how bad it is, I've put this one down smack dab in the middle. I cannot fathom wasting another moment of my life on this ill-conceived, unfocused piece of trash.My complaints: This book goes NO where. You are stuck with unbeliveable and unlikeable characters doing nothing. And when the characters might do something it is wholly implausible. (A former college professor going to lithuania to set up a mail fraud scheme with his lover's ex-husband?! Please!) I put the book down when Franzen attributed complex thoughts to a five year old.While it appears from other reviews this book is a love/hate proposition, I cannot fathom what anyone could have liked about this book. No plot, no real characters, no direction, nothing. I would compare this book with getting teeth extracted. In a word: horrible."
2,Just plain boring!,The first 150 pages or so I was engrossed in the book. Then I kept reading and I couldn't take it anymore. I started skimming over large sections of the book to get through it faster. The characters were not interesting enough to have ~100 pages written about each one of them. I started using this book as a tool to fall asleep on the airplane.
3,Depressing and Draining,"Like so many other Oprah Book Club books, this one will sap you of any emotional optimism and resiliency you may have built up over the last 12 months. However, it is also well-written, insightful and allows you to see a sad, horrible situation from the many points of view that allowed it to become what it is. It is everything you hope your family will not be."
4,"Sorry, Oprah, I'm...uhh...Busy","...The scope of this book is enormously far-reaching. It is obvious almost from the start what a great amount of research went into this book. While I admire the erudite perfectionism of Franzen's novel, I felt it also took away from its emotional center at times. Franzen attempts partial omniscience on subjects as diverse as cooking and mathematics, chemistry and the Lithuanian historical landscape. While I admire his vision, I find over-researched and over-reaching writing (supposing, even, that Franzen is expert on all of his subjects) bombastic and disingenuous, and Corrections sometimes approaches those boundaries. Perfectionism can sometimes distract from the pure beauty of a single vision in its quest for comprehensive authority."
3,Reluctant Admiration,"...P>Franzen's Lambert clan keeps you engaged in their misadventures and over-the-top experiences as they struggle with simpler life themes. Franzen's ego does shine through in this book, which frankly ought to have been 50-100 shorter with tighter editing. And though I strongly feel that The Corrections is certainly not the ""Great American Novel"" the self-satisfied Mr. Franzen believes it to be, it is certainly a well-written and laudable ""Great American Dysfunctional Family Novel"".On a completely childsih and pedantic note, Enid is EVIL."
2,I Really Wanted to Like it!,"I had heard so much about this book and had put it on top of my summer reading list. What a big disappointment. There were many times in the book that I wanted to put it down, but did not because so many people had liked it. I am sorry I didn't.While, I thought that the story line was boring and quite frankly pretentious, the quality of the writing was good. Franzen does an excellent job of painting a picture with words. However, even this is not enough to devote the time of reading this book."
4,Like it more over time,"My book club read this in October. The consensus was that it was a difficult book to read, but it did provoke lively discussion, with widely varying viewpoints. There is a lot to discuss and think about in this book. Our major complaint was the extreme wordiness -- the author seems in love with the idea of writing lots of words, much of which are needless. The hallucinations seem to be for shock value and go on and on for far too long.I loved how the initial one-dimensional characters grew throughout the book. As the characters unfold, a further understanding of each one led me to change my opinions of each character as I grew to understand them.Over time, whenever I think about Corrections, I find myself liking it more and more. In my opinion it is worth plowing through the wordiness to get to the meat of the story."
4,A very pleasant surprise,"I don?t usually like and typically avoid books about family life and strife in American suburbia. But ""The Corrections"" is a book I liked alot. The characters are fantastic - they are complex, funny, failing yet strong. The messes they get themselves into appear absurd but at the same time the reader feels he couldn?t help but have done the same or worse. The conflict around ""where to spend Xmas"" is amazingly realistically done. The humor is wonderful, and takes away from the typical ""taking-itself-too-seriously-feel"" of many novels of the genre. I am quite surprised this book has not been more enthusiastically received by Amazon.com reviewers - in my opinion it was far better than anything by Updike, Ford, Lee..."
3,Not a single sympathetic character in the bunch.,"Dispicable cast and lots of verbal masterbation. This novel could have used another edit or three. But an epic book, nonetheless."
4,You can't go home again,"I read this book as I traveled home for Christmas for the first time in 8 years and I found it both thought provoking and emotionally evocative. Johnathon Franzen has painted a remakable portrait of an American family at the turn of the century, and textured his work with wide-ranging commentary on political correctness, technological innovation and global economics. Underlying all of these themes is the essential paradox of our times: the more comfortable we become, the harder we strive to make ourselves, our jobs, and our families perfect, the less happy we really are.I liked the book. And I'm glad I took the trip."
2,Why 2 stars?,"I don't know....the whole experience of this book was confusing. I rushed to buy it after Oprah recommended it so highly. I started reading it and wondered what happened to that book she was so excited about. I just didn't get it. I didn't care about any of the characters and I never got involved in the story, nor was I able to really follow it so well. I guess I just didn't care..because I gave up after about 125 pages, which is something I rarely do. Maybe I will try it again one day, but for now there are too many other books."
3,Typos,"This is a great book - almost as good as Freedom, however the amount of spelling errors and incorrect words in this copy make for EXTREMELY frustrating reading. Good luck with purchasing & deciphering the book!"
2,"""Blah, blah, blah...""","Way too many words! There were parts of this book I absolutely loved. There were times I stopped reading to write down what I had just read because it struck me to my very core. Unfortunately, there were more minding numbing, endless pages of just 'words' to get through to reach those points. Skimming, skimming, skimming. Obviously based on the numerous awards and the high amount of rave reviews here on Amazon, I am in the minority, but it is how I feel. I told my friend I would like to give her a redacted version. Someone give me a wide tip black magic marker!!!"
1,I wanted to love this book,"I wanted to love this book. After a boring start, I got into the first section and really wanted to get to know the characters... and then it just started rambling and lost me. I am trying very hard to finish this novel but might have to throw in the towel. It's just bad, boring, nonsensical, rambling... and the shame is, it doesn't have to be. I wish the author had stayed with the original characters and continued on with the story. Instead he introduces new superficial characters that I have no interest in and adds a bunch of research and boring information. This could have been a great story but he dropped the ball. Don't buy this book. Get it from the library if you must and then give it back before you finish reading it... save yourself some money."
4,Overhyped? Yes. A great book? Yes,"Yes, this book has been overhyped. But its still a worthwhile, eye-opening read. Franzen captures how individuals are evolving, constantly struggling, and striving for happiness, even when its unlikely or not even possible."
2,disdaining people and bizarre writing,"I fell for the READ IT review and lost. Having made it thru this tome, waiting for some lesson, something of real worth, I am very disappointed. One can easily do without one-third of the book with all its ridiculous fabrications. The writer clearly is or knows someone who has feelings of great contempt for one's parents and other people. Hopefully, the majority of readers won't identify. This is a book about the saddest of people who spend their lives in hatred and contempt and make attempts to punish others and retaliate for perceived wrongs. But there are no lessons learned. Its a depressing disjointed run on and I feel it was a waste of time."
3,I loved it and hated it!,"I agree with so many other reviewers. The writing is brillliant, and there were many parts where I laughed out loud. Chip is so pathetic, and when he steals the fish and puts it in his pants I laughed till I cried. But parts of this novel are so drawn out and boring. I'm not sure I would have finished it if it wasn't my book club selection. Since I did finish it, I have a problem with the ending which seemed more like the author got tired of writing and just ended it. Very abrupt. It left me feeling like I got cheated because so many loose ends never got resolved. I also did not appreciate Franzen's expecting us to like Alfred in the end when he spent a good part of the book making us dislike him."
1,A big NO,"This is an honest attempt to write a novel that is contemporary; hence, lots of discussion about international trade agreements, pharmacology, hollywood and the whole culture industry, academic critical theory, et cetera, et cetera.Unfortunatley, Franzen has no style. And that's enough to kill a book. And it kills this one. I second the person who said ideas and characters were lifted from Delillo's WHITE NOISE, particularly the way the young children gang up and verbally attack their parents.The dialogue is uninspired; the description is unimaginative. Franzen moves through time in a very plodding way.Again, I have to second another reviewer: if you want to read a great book on families, read THE MAN WHO LOVED CHILDREN by Christina Stead."
1,Boring,I tried to make myself read this book but just could not. It is one of only maybe 5 books in my life I have ever started and decided not to finish. I simply did not care what happened to any of the characters.
2,Difficult to Read?,"I began this book with a desire to become lost in a story. But maybe I've missed something. It is full of sentences 8 lines long and many words I'd never heard of before. It probably is well written but what is the plot? I do not like to use the dictionary every 5 pages. It takes away from the enjoyment. Even though I am a college graduate, I was not impressed.If you feel as I do, try reading ""Sing Me A Bawdy Song."" It is probably not as well written, however, it has a great plot and it will make you laugh and it will make you cry. Maybe."
1,literature lover,"This book is all media hype. You get the feeling that the author not only has contempt for his own characters, but for the reader as well. This book has one-dimensional characters, a silly plot and writing that tries hard to dazzle and falls flat. If you think Oprah's list is complex and deep literature, then this is the book for you."
1,Garbage,Why would someone who has such obvious potential as Jonathan Franzen waste it on writing this depressing book? I kept reading in order to be pleasantly surprised but went away feeling a giant letdown. Overblown and boring with some fantastic bits stuck in randomly; but these bits are not worth ploughing through the rest of this overrated tragedy.
1,Most boring and pretentious book I ever read,"I was determined to finish this book regardless of how boring and pretentious I thought it was. Jonathan Franzen seems to be so impressed with himself, he is not thinking at all about the reader or the story telling. Was it Freudian that I accidentally left the book on a train? Perhaps, but not wanting to purchase the book again (or read it for that matter), I finished it on audio book from the library - the abridged version. It was torture as well."
4,Abridge-me-not,"I missed this book when it came out, but after listening to and being awed by Freedom, I had to go back and get this one. Every bit as incisive, true, and gut-wrenching as the newer book, but I realized halfway through that I had downloaded the abridged version by mistake.Never again.There is nothing to gain from gutting a masterful work of fiction for the purpose of convenience, if that's the reason why books get abridged. As I finished the book, I had a feeling like I missed something, and the experience did not ring true.While I now have to go back and get the unabridged version to find out what I missed, I can still unequivocally give this book a 4 star rating, because the power of the writing and the insight came through loud and clear, even if incomplete.The Corrections"
1,Unreadable,"I don't typically abandon a book, but I have been struggling with finishing this one. Maybe it's because I don't like Franzen's writing style, that I could care less about any of the characters, or that it's a painfully slow read."
1,Clueless people behaving accordingly,"If you read for pleasure, don't buy this book. In the opening scene we encounter swiss-cheese-brained losers and it's all downhill from there."
1,Cheap Melodrama from a Grant Hog,"Franzen pretends to be a philosopher who will follow any commercial siren song that takes him away from the book he should be writing. In fact, this is the best he can do. Like fellow grant hog Rick Moody, Franzen believes that he has discovered an authentic Vermeer painting stuck in a dusty corner of a conterminous country squire's chilly manor. Instead he finds some cobwebs and sawdust. The Corrections truly tells us a lot about the author's capacity for trite obsession, self-deception, and his weaselly response to the lure of great art. I would rather have been mugged than reading it."
1,A waste of time and money,Nothing is ever resolved. There is no point to any of it. This book does nothing but depress and bore the reader. Don't put yourself through the agony!!
1,bored to death,"My sister urged me to keep reading, so I did, all the way to the bitter end. I never cared about one of the dysfunctional characters. No one had freedom as everyone was involved in deconstructive relationships that deflated any sense of purpose. I can't believe I spent so much time waiting for some redeeming characteristic to push through."
4,Worth the effort,"As much as this is a superbly written novel, I felt it sometimes could have benefited from some further editing. It sometimes struck me as too long and too detailed. The separate and intersecting lives of a dysfunctional midwestern family are brought into sharp focus. The aging mother, Enid, clumsily searches for fulfillment in her own life as she copes with the advancing Parkinsonism of her husband Alfred. The three grown children have their own problems to deal with. Alfred's increasing dementia, his hallucinations, and his family's reactions to these symptoms are brilliantly depicted through interior monologue and fractured dialogue. If for nothing else, this book is worth it for the view that it gives of the demented father's thoughts and feelings. If you have the patience to make your way through this (sometimes) overly detailed novel, you will be richly rewarded."
2,Overwritten; better than Sonata,"This one was too long by a good 100 pages, frequently tedious, and would have been much better had Franzen not been so occupied with being ""writerly"" (a deadly boring quality in an author). In too many places, Franzen seems to forget that he's telling a story, as he's too busy exercising his vocabulary. Frankly, I don't care how many five-dollar words he knows, or how cleverly he can incorporate them into complex sentences. They don't impress. I know five-dollar words, too, and lots of clever folks can produce verbal structures fit to make one's head swim. Sadly, Franzen's verbal acrobatics serve his image of Serious Writer more than they serve his story. In fiction, story is all, story is what truly matters, and it suffers here at the hands of etymology. Let's hope he finds a stronger editor next time, who'll tell him to just bloody well get on with it. On the whole, a disappointing read but an excellent sleep-inducer."
2,Horrible,I am an avid reader and find that Oprah's picks are generally on target. This book was horrible. The writing was pretentious;the plot lines rambled and dragged on and on and on and on.......I have had a very tough time finishing this!
2,Mostly disappointing,"I picked up this book after reading several positive reviews for it, and decided to give it a shot. I was fairly disappointed. It's not that the story's bad or the characters aren't believable. The writing is sub-par. Franzen's overuse of excessively, um, unique metaphors detract from the narrative and make it a painful read. Lines like ""two empty hours were a sinus in which infections bred,"" and ""her open eye was like nearly black balsamic vinegar beading on white china"" are not clever. Nor are they particularly helpful in describing the mood or the appearance of someone or something. This is the kind of writing that high school English teachers surround in red ink with words like ""simplify."" I know my high school English teachers never would have let me get away with this kind of rubbish. This book would have been significantly more ejoyable if the reader didn't have to navigate around needlessly complex phraseology and flowerly writing that doesn't add anything to the story."
2,Like Passing a Car Accident...,"One can't help but take a look, even though we know that the sight may not be pleasant. After all the hype, what a disappointment! The characters were amusing in a situation comedy-ish way but not particularly complex: Franzen's narrative description of what happened to them was readable and at times funny but hardly thoughtful or insightful. Some of his ""messages,"" particularly at the novel's end, were practically hammered over the readers' head. He seemed to have a particularly hard time developing his women characters - at times they were flat and fake, almost trite. While stronger editing might have helped this novel, it would not solve its real problem: although Franzen is quite clever at describing situations and people in a hiply sarcastic and superficial way, he hasn't yet developed the maturity or the insight to understand them."
2,Why the hype?,I can't quite figure out what all they hype about this book is? It's a rather tedious story about a family that is not particularly interesting or compelling. You won't be missing anything if you skip this one. I wish I'd quit reading at the halfway point instead of slogging through it.
2,A smart Tom Wolfe,"Like Tom Wolfe, Franzen writes smug. Unlike Tom Wolfe, Franzen writes masterly ... full of nuance and intracacy. My biggest hangup is that he devoted nearly 600 pages to his ego and shoe-horning in everything he knows about everything. And throughout, I couldn't help thinking Franzen is enamored with the consumer culture he sets out to criticize ... just like Chip. If powerful fiction is honest, Corrections is weak. I say give Franzen a few years. With a few experiences under his belt, he won't be so full of himself. His ability to write is masterly."
3,The Hype Worked: Shame on Me!,"The PR hype machine worked to perfection, in fact it may have fallen victim to itself -- a train that everyone boarded and that couldn't be stopped for lack of resistance. Was anyone brave enough to call ""The Corrections"" just plain dull, melodramatic, and full of characters that are totally unsympathetic, even pathetic? Very unfortunately, it was the sort of PR effort (led by FSG!) that creates lots of cynicism even among folks who supposedly already have a keen eye out for the media hucksters.Franzen is a terrific wordsmith and confident observer of everyday familial minutia. And it sort of feels like a ""big"" book, but I'll take the best of Updike, DeLillo, Robert Stone, even Richard Ford any day of the week."
3,Depends on what you're looking for!!,"After reading The Corrections, I'm not quite sure what to think. I went in with the wrong expectations. I had just finished reading Tending Roses, by Lisa Wingate and I was looking for another heartwarming book about an estranged family getting together over Christmas to work out their differences. I saw The Corrections, and I thought, great this will be like the book I just loved. The Corrections surprised me. It was really edgy. Anyway, if you like edgy, gritty books, you'll probably like it. If you're looking for a sweet, inspiring family story, it's not your thing."
3,Way too many words and not enough story,"This book is long and overblown but it has some entertaining parts, especially in his depiction of the dysfunctional son and daughter meeting the parents in New York before the parents leave for a cruise. My main criticism is that while the author captures some of the angst of the modern family, the characters don't really grow or change and not much happens to them. It would have been a more entertaining read if he had dropped a lot of the background information on minor characters and taken more effort with the major ones."
1,Plodding,"I don't know why this book won any rewards. at best it is plodding and at its worse it is boring. It is almost impossible to care what happens to the characters in this book. I would not have purchased this book, if it hadn't been reccommended by Oprah Winfrey. Once I had purchased it, I realized that I had read Mr. Franzen's previous book and hated it evenmore than this one."
1,The saddest thing,"is the degree of artistic and cultural bankruptcy required to make this come off as anything less than a tin man's lament. The characters are cliches, without the wit of their abbreviation, the plot's as deep and undulate as a backyard puddle, and the message, which bears the watery thumbprints of an island castaway, is of the hey it's your family I guess the old man wasn't such a (...) after all your mom did her best variety that does Hallmark proud. For only one stranded on a very rare island would think this work anything but banal, or the author that gave it life anything but second-rate."
1,Yet another book about a dysfunctional American family,"Skip this book. There really is nothing to like about it. The characters are so revolting that you find yourself hating them and the book. The only reason why I finished the book is because its for our book club, otherwise I would have cut my losses after the first chapter. If I could have rated it a zero or less I would have!"
4,Surprised by all the negative reviews,"A common thread amongst the many harsh reader reviews seems to be ""I didn't like any of the characters."" Is that the point? The characters in this book are not potential friends, they are characters in a book and I think they are beautifully drawn. I found them to be very real. No one can tell me that there aren't a million or more Enids out there. I recognized her immediately. And that goes for Chip, Gary, Alfred and Denise. These aren't one dimensional characters. And, in fact, I found likeable qualities in all of them (not Gary's wife and kids, I have to say). I think one can say that the structure of this book is something to behold."
1,Not the Second Coming of Great Literature!,"After all the hype, I fully expected to be in for a great reading experience. What a disappointment. Other than the fact that it's filled with current pop culture references, it's completely derivative of many novels that have come before -- read Richard Yates's ""Revolutionary Road"" as an example. Why he needed over 550 pages to tell this story, is a big mystery. Some of the writing is quite good, but you have to plow through so much bloated pretentious prose to get to any of it that it's really not worth it."
2,I thought I had a disfunctional family,"The book is billed as a story of a family who gets together for one last Christmas but we don't reach this point of the story until approximately 80 pages until the end of the book. Instead we are subjected to each family members life of dysfunction Thse people don't just have small every day problems like most people but huge big ones that they make all by themselves. Are they sympathetic in anyway that you would be able to empathize with them and hope they get through the problems? No, not even close. They actually deserve what they are going through. For these reason it was hard to get through the book. Sure, there are some good moments but nothing that I would care to tell anyone about.And to think this is going to be made into a movie and I can't see sitting through a humorless mess of dysfunction for two hours.Beware."
2,Holiday cheer for the entire family,"Ok, maybe not quite. To be honest, this is a hard novel to either recomend or disparage. Franzen is obviously a very talented writer and there are stretches of really funny writing scattered throughout the book. For example, Chip's adventures in academia, New York and Lithuania could have made for a pretty good book in and of themselves (if you like cheap but easy laughs). And the passages which document Alfred's descent into dementia are truly horrifying.On the other hand, the prose in a lot of the book is simply workmanlike - trudge, trudge, trudge forward - and to be frank, boring. I can't see telling someone to go ahead and try this book when when their reading time, like mine, is probably limited....So, not bad but nothing really to write home about. If Oprah hadn't chosen this as one of her picks (incidently, did anyone even remotely connected with her show read it beforehand?), we wouldn't even be hearing about it now."
2,I was disappointed,"Though I saw many good insights in this book, the characters and plot got lost in a sea of rhetoric. All of us stem from some family disfunction, but we need to find the glue that holds us together. This book spilled the glue and left the family in worse distress than we found them."
1,The Corrections - not recommended for Oprah's list by our book club,"My book club read The Corrections and it was unanimously disliked. There is not one single character to identify with positively or one action taken by a character that was done with positive intentions. In summation, its a very dark view of humanity and leaves the reader feeling as dismal and hopeless as the characters themselves."
2,The Corrections--unoriginal,"My biggest issue with The Corrections is that I found it unoriginal. Chip, his career, his relationship with one of his students, his drug use, his obsession with his bad manuscript, and his lack of responsibility all reminded me of Grady Tripp in Wonder Boys, only not nearly as compelling. As far as talking turds go, nothing will ever be as shocking or as funny as Mr Hanky from South Park.The sections of the book that redeem it are the ones that include Gary and his family. Not because Gary is a nice guy but because I believe the descriptions of his life. This is more than I can say for the other characters, except perhaps Denise.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I'd tell them to read Wonder Boys by Micheal Chabon, instead."
2,A man in love with his pen.,"I would actually give this 2.5 stars, a square down the middle C effort, and that is only because I'm sure there is a good book buried in there somewhere (like the optimist's pony). I think the author realized his main fault--he's a poor character study, and decided to spin his tale into satire. Good move. Unfortunately, his secondary fault--pompous verbosity, escapes him entirely. Did he leave ANYTHING out? I wish he had because there are flashes of really good writing. It's just the ratio of good to banal is not in his favor. It will be interesting to see what he does from here on out."
4,Intense,Had to read the book based upon the Oprah issue alone. I liked this book a lot but became disinterested with some of the sub-plots that seemed to go nowhere (impending execution). I recognize these issues added depth - but detracted from the intriguing family dynamic. Incredible new writer with great character development. I think his editor could have trimmed back some of the meanderings. Mental Health and Aging issues were incredibly well written. I definitely recommend reading this book. A great book club discussion book.
4,A cozy snapshot of late 20th century America,"(excerpted and condensed from NYTimes review)By turns funny and corrosive, portentous and affecting, ""The Corrections"" not only shows us two generations of an American family struggling to make sense of their lives, but also cracks open a window on a sullen country lurching its way toward the millennium.""The Corrections"" is a remarkably poised narrative held together by a myriad of meticulously observed details and tiny motifs that create a mosaiclike picture of America in the waning 20th century. And while the story line is propelled by several suspenseful questions - whether Alfred's patent for a metallurgical discovery will pay off, whether Chip will escape from Lithuanian thugs, whether the shotgun in the Lamberts' basement will be put to use - the real tension in ""The Corrections"" stems from the characters' emotional dramas, rather than from the sort of contrived plot points found in the Franzen's earlier novels...."
1,WHY?,"I made it to page 80 and just couldn't go any further. WHY, oh WHY did Oprah want to honor this book?I gave it one star because the author knows how to put sentences together reasonably well. That's the only reason."
2,Wish I Could Finish This Book,"I reached page 341 weeks ago and haven't picked it up since. If I didn't feel guilty over the [money] I spent and the fact that I've rarely ditched a book, I'd sell it used. Franzen is a pretty good writer and there are lots of insightful and amusing tidbits about human behavior scattered throughout, but the story itself is tedious and drawn out ad nauseum: it's just not very compelling nor are the characters. Maybe the book reminds us that some dysfunctional families are in fact as boring as this one and their members equally one-dimensional. How depressing. The novel might have been better if it was more concise and the clever tidbits showcased in short stories. I'll try to finish it, but don't pull out your plastic-buy the paperback."
2,Year's greatest fiction??,"Oof! Jonathan F. obviously has his craft down, and the book flows quickly enough. but I would think that for a character driven novel, 500+ pages are enough to create people whose main traits aren't the face-value facets lifted off of poor shmucks parading themselves on day time talk shows. I felt none of the characters had any depth to speak of. I'm sure my parents would love to have my copy along side their countless Dick Francis novels."
2,Just put it down.,"I've made it to page 316. Three hundred and sixteen agonising pages of family angst and a deluge of masturbatory red herrings later, I've decided to just put it down. The two stars are for actually getting me to read this far. There may be some merit in that, but that's about it."
1,This was not even good enough to read on the Metro.,"I have almost nothing positive to say about this book. None of the characters were likeable. The situations they were put in were predictable. The language was pretentious. The only reason I read this book was because my mother gave it to my fiancee as a gift, and I was bored. I should have stayed bored. This was a terrible book. I can't believe that this got such great reviews. The good reviews, I fear, are proof of either grade inflation in today's universities, or the self-evident worthlessness of postmodernist writing. Give me ""East of Eden"" any old day."
1,poorly researched story,"Good writing but poorly researched story. I lived for five years in Vilnius Lithuania, Lonely Planet calls the ""New Prague"" and the greenest old town in Eastern Europe.All this time I never met a local who ate horse meat, saw a driveby shooting, or any street or village named after a foreigner. Vilnius has the only statue of rock icon Frank Zappa in the world though.The inaccuracies spoiled it for me."
1,"Awful, just awful","I hated hated hated this book. I found it pedantic, depressing, and boring. The characters were all unlikeable; self centered and rude. If this is supposed to be a look into a family, it is the most disfunctional fmaily I've ever come across, and that includes the Bundys and the Manson fmaily. An awful book, don't waste your time!"
2,Disappointed,"I expected a comic satire on the American family and got just the opposite. This book is depressing from the beginning to the end. No one is happy with themselves or each other. They are cruel and selfish individuals. The only character that isn't totally selfcentered is the grandchild Jonah, and he too chooses in the end to do what is most pleasant for himself, rather than going to the grandmothers. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Franzen sporting two day stubble in jacket photo...,"...is your first warning. You can skim entire sections of this book without missing anything. Lots of scenes are clearly written for big picture deal. I might not have been so severe had I not just finished reading Sijie Dai's ""Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress"" -- a wonderful book that probably makes Franzen's writing seem worse than it is."
2,It's not the worst thing I've read...,"but it's not the best either. I had a really hard time getting into the story and believing the characters. I do agree with other reviewers that it is more literary than a lot of books out there, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a great book.I do like some of the wordplay and imagery Franzen uses. He is excellent with using language to create emotion and images that make you think. However, some of his writing gets a little too over the top and it becomes hard to follow at all.The characters are really hard to understand because they are so dysfunctional and poorly developed. You really don't feel much for any of them because you just don't care.Would I recommend this to family and friends? No. I am reading it with a friend of mine who wanted to read it - I wouldn't have chose to read it otherwise."
2,Long-distance hike through knee-deep mud,"I couldn't wait to get this book after reading the reviews. I'm a lover of serious literature. I was disappointed to find the characters loathsome and tedious. I need at least one person in a story whom I like and am rooting for. I didn't even feel compassion for these people. They are so infuriatingly self-destructive, irresponsible, selfish, and emotionally lazy.The story itself was long, slow and unengaging. I dragged myself through it in hopes of a pay-off in the end, but the ""corrections"" were skimpy, simplistic, and left me frustrated and irritable. The writing itself was pretentious and tiresome. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.Franzen seems skilled and smart, but defeated by his own self-consciousness. I hope to see better from him."
1,Up there a bit,"I am not fooled by Franzen for one minute. He is an insufferably complainer, and always has been. A great writer? Okay, he is up there with Tolkien, but not with Atwood.Avoid."
1,Biggest waste of time in a while....,"I had high expectations of this book and was terribly dissappointed. It attempts a lot but succeeds in nothing. Maybe it is a reflection of our times? I found myself truly disliking all characters, feeling no understanding towards them and being totally annoyed at their *mis*adventures. How boring! All you have to do is look in your neighborhood (or your own family) for people like this-- not a new story and nothing to be learned nor gained by reading about it. This book truly fails to soar over every-day family disfunction into something that is worth remembering."
5,This is about as good as it gets,"Great art creates contoversy. It's refreshing to see the ""love-it-or-hate-it"" extremes posted on this site.I thought Franzen's observational narrative close to perfect. His attitude is real...a very stimulating yet chilling experience. He sees the human psyche as vividly as anyone.Reminiscent of Wolfe but consistently in control.For a great read, this is it!"
1,Franzen could be a great writer if he wasnt so hateful,"I read Freedom first, then this one and will not be reading anything else by Franzen. He has talent--I loved the part early in the book about Alfred looking at the sunflowers and mistaking their reflection for children. Just one problem--Franzen seriously hates women. Every female character in both Freedom and The Corrections is portrayed to be strong and confident--at first. Then, after about a hundred pages every one of his female characters is suddenly revealed to be neurotic or evil or a bimbo or all of the three. It's as if his message is ""See? That's what women are really like once you get to know them."" I quit reading at page 317 and was so offended by how stupid Franzen had made the Enid character--no woman is that stupid!--that I had to go out for a long walk. Silver lining: I borrowed both books from the library, so no money wasted."
2,Not at all inspiring,"Why my bookclub loved this book and author is beyond me... I had to work to get through it. Can't even say it was disturbing, because it couldn't capture my interest at all."
2,You are stressing me Franzen,"Franzen's novel is intermittently captivating..about 3 pages at a grope....At the end of the day..and that comes FAR too along the path to endure..""Corrections"" is an incredibly tedious whinefest about people you wouldn't cross the street to meet. And if you did you'd run whelping.This is a 3rd rate indulgfest that passes for creative literature! Spare me...The foundation of any decent literature is caring..engagement...Why anyone would care about a slurpy of senile guilt mongering and past it adolescent whiny pleading is beyond me. Any woman laying Chris has serious need issues and needs to find the real article.Disgusting characters...boring ""life issues""...and a kind of ""like me or else"" attitude on Franzen's part. This dude is way overrated!"
2,Much ado about nothing,"After all the fuss about this book I could not wait to get my hands on it. Throughout my reading, however, I could not wait for Mr. Franzen to get to the point. In the end it was an uninteresting tale about a dysfunctional family."
1,Boring,"I was very excited about reading this book. Some of the reviews lead me to believe that this book was engaging. Boring ,boring I waited for something to happen and every time your interest was engaged you are let down."
5,hilarious,"If much about contemporary American culture seems wrong to you, you might like this book as much as I did. Frantzen's sentences are magnificently constructed to reveal shades of bemusement and satire. It is a novel, so there is some bagginess. But for sheer over-the-top entertainment, indulge!"
3,A Correction Re Philly,"Since everyone has said virtually eveything that can be said about this book via all these reviews, I've got a correction I wish to make re the perspective you will get about the city of Philadelphia from this author/book. In short, he trashes the city several times in several ways throughout the novel. In my opinion, as someone who has been there many times for many reasons, Philadelphia is a great destination. Franzen's idea of Philly is ""dismal,"" as he writes -- lacking beauty, style, etc. Franzen is wrong and I can only hope that those of you who travel there enjoy all that Philly offers."
4,Actually lives up to the hype!,"Don't listen to the negative reviews- this is an excellent novel. The story is fairly simple, and imagine that most of you have gotten well accquainted with it in the below reveiws, so I won't go into it. But the plot is what drives this story; rather, it is the wonderfully crafted characters of the Lambert family. Some complain that there are no likeable characters in this book, and to a certain extent this is true. But they are all sympathetic. Watching their lives fall apart is a tragic, moving experience."
3,miserable family,"While I think that the author is incredibly insightful and captures all the minute details of human relationships, this family is so miserable and screwed up you feel depresssed hearing all their unforgiving, selfish and materialistic thoughts. Generally a downer."
2,"""Grandly entertaining""? More like stomach-turning.","Struggled valiantly to make it through this supposedly ""grandly entertaining novel."" Managed 120 of 560 pages, then decided life is too short to punish oneself with neverending ugly family scenes and impossible-to-like characters. Even if it *is* a National Book Award winning novel. Blecch. You've got to have a strong stomach to make it through this one. Either that, or you've got to really enjoy watching people's lives fall apart."
3,A slo-mo train wreck,"I decided I could not in all fairness give this book only one star since I did finish it and at times was morbidly curious about the characters. The problem for me was that most of the time I felt like I was experiencing a disaster in slo-motion and the author made me along with all the characters, completely helpless. I'm not a reader that needs to like every character or even agree with their choices. But I became a bit weary of all the poor choices they all made over and over. This book did remind me of the author's subsequent book ""Freedom"" in style, pace and helpless characters. My question to the author: Do you intend for every family to be dysfunctional in your upcoming books? If so, I'll take a pass, because this becomes boring after awhile."
4,The Corrections,"Franzen's descriptions are almost poetry in his use of analogies. The subject could be said to be a dysfunctional family, but it is about any family and its weakest and strongest members. The interplay of the members' lives and the interweaving of events knit a fascinating story. The book is very entertaining."
2,a portrait without insight,"I agree that this book presents a portrait of american life, but the portrait is more of an impressionist work from which we are left trying to discern details. Up close, it is blurry and undefined, like these characters and their nebulous conflicts. I realize that this aspect of intrafamilial conflict is likely what the author was trying to express- that sometimes you can't exactly pinpoint when or how your parents ruined your life, for example- but i think this book could stand to give some sort of insight beyond the extremely well-developed character studies.The characters are stereotypes, certainly, but i would have liked to see them given more humanity. Their flaws were very well developed, but what of their redeeming qualities? I'm not expecting some happy-go-lucky piece of fluff fiction, i just found the book a tad myopic.That said, i'm no book critic, just someone who likes to read."
1,A disfuncional family that is impossible to care about,"I can't imagine how this book managed to win a national book award. Its characters take disfunctional to new heights and as a reader I could not summon any sympathy for any of them. Franzen also jumps all around making it very difficult to follow whatever plot there is. If I hadn't had to read this for a book group, I'm sure I would have given up early on."
5,"If You Don't Get It, The Joke May Be On You","It makes sense to me that this book is so polarizing. Half the people I talk to about the book didn't seem to get the appeal at all and the other half feel like it is one of the best books ever written. I am firmly in the latter camp. It's the Pornoy's Complaint for 30-something overachievers, the sons and daughters of overbearing mid-western parents. It's hilarious and poignant in the same cringe-and-advert-your-eyes way as Curb Your Enthusiasm is, and I'm sure for a lot of people the book hits uncomfortably close to home.In regards to the Freedom vs. The Corrections discussion: Freedom is much more mainstream and dry and filled with unlikable characters it is a struggle to relate to. The Corrections is his less accessible, incredibly witty opus with characters you may simultaneously love and hate but whose motivations you always understand."
1,The Corrections,"This book is 200+ pages too long. Way too much filler, etc. A good editor would have been helpful. I will never read this author again. Scanned many of the pages of description and unnecessary ""side-bars."" What a waste. I know there is a story here but just give us the story. I read way too much to be bothered with nonsense in any book!"
2,Kindle edition - full of typos,"Think twice before buying the Kindle edition of this novel. It' s full of typos that on some occations make the text incomprehensible and on a great number of occations are really annoying. As an example there are a lot of references to ""Aslan"" - the lion of Narnia. Most of the time this is spelt ""asian"" in the Kindle edition. I can see that correcting typos in a printed edition is diffucult, but I can find no excuse for not correcting this in an electronic version. Note that my number of stars is not related to the book itself - I really enjoy this novel - only to the Kindle version!"
1,Revealing Character,"I was disappointed with the ""character"" of the shot. The photos were plain posed shots that weren't character revealing."
4,Reliable seller,"This seller delivered the book ordered on a timely fashion, and deserves four stars."
2,Better in stores,"When at our Washington DC home, I found great curry sauces and other Indian Simmering sauces at Trader Joe's. This was OK if you can't find a store near you with Indian condiments and cooking things. I find it hard to wait for anything edible thru the mail!"
5,Marriage Fitness by Mort Fertel,"Great Book. It concentrates on what you can do to improve or rescue your marriage. Unlike other counselors that concentrate on fixing the problems, Mort addresses the ""love"" factor in a marriage and how you can get back to what you were when you first fell in love."
3,Very Conflictng Message,"I just read this book and I even though I'm not opposed to some of what Mort Fertel says, some of the things in his book disturb me. On page 139 he makes the statement ""your life ended when your marriage began"" this along with some other statments leads me to se this book as a guide book to becomoing co-dependent rather than relationship development. He implies that for couples to be happy they must call each other all the time, sacrfice their own jobs, ambitions, hobbies and all that is unique to them to have a successful marriage. I use to know people who sacrificed their whole life for the sake of their marriage and when it still ended they didn't know who they were anymore.Having said all of this I do believe that couples who grow apart from to much desire of independence can be a cause of an unhappy marriage. I just think there needs to be more of a balance to this than Mr. Fertel shows in his book."
4,Paperback better than ebook.,"I bought both and while the content is overall the same the ebook is missing key extras in between chapters that may be of interest to the reader.As for the book itself, I totally loved it! I feel that most people in a marriage would benefit from reading it. I learned that there were many things I could work on and improve my marriage. I can say that following just a few suggestions so far have truly helped my marriage improve in the the two months since discovered it.If you are confused about how to fix and reconnect in your marriage give the book a try."
5,"Save your marriage, buy this book.","I bought this book around 4:00am unable to sleep after finding out about my wife's emotional infidelity. Our marriage had officially hit rock bottom. She wanted out. I wanted to fix it. We started seeing a Marriage Counselor but we weren't getting what we wanted out of it. $50/hr to bring up the same issues, talk about the hurt, and blame each other. It wasn't working. This book has some pretty unconventional advise. If your looking for communication techniques like parroting back what your partner just got finished saying you won't find it here. This book focuses on putting the love back into your marriage, because when your in love the problems are easier to deal with. I can say that our marriage has never been better. We've gone from the brink of divorce to a loving marriage once again and I feel that this book has been a big part of that success."
2,clever & conversational but lacking substance,"After the first two chapters, which I enjoyed, I quickly grew impatient with Fertel's clever quippiness and then I grew frustrated and bored. The exercises were a disappointment because they seemed like what a high school writing class might dream up for an assignment. It seemed as though he started strong and ran out of substance long before he ran out of energy and wordiness. When, at the end of one of his chapters, he reassured me that ""Love conquers all"" it looked as though he was finally running low on words. And then he summed up how to have phenomenal sex in one page. This is obviously a self-published piece. No serious editor got his hands on this before it went to print. Though spell check was apparently put to good use."
2,don't waste your money on the book or CD's,"The book was very repetitive, as if he couldn't think of enough material to fill the book. Don't bother buying his CD's either because they have all the exact same info as this book. His CD's were very repetitive and have very poor sound quality."
3,"Good, Straightforward Schubert","This is a good, solid version of these pieces, and the Adagio and Rondo Concertante in F is hard to find and worth hearing. At the price, it's hard to resist. The recorded sound is excellent."
3,contains my favorite Exploied songs,"The Exploited can be hit or miss. They have some brilliant punk music, and they also have some real garbage. Interestingly, you'll hear both on the Death Before Dishonour with bonus tracks CD. His vocals are distinct, and depending on his mood the day they recorded, it can be grating or could be great (for this music anyway). The Exploited also went through some line-up changes, so it depends who was in the band at the time as to what kind of songs you get. If you want thrash-punk-metal with a Scottish accent, The Exploited's DBD w/bonuses is a good listen. It's regarded as their crossover album from ""punk"" to ""metal"" but really I think The Exploited were always a blend. Two of my all time favorite songs are Politician and Privacy Invasion, so for me this is a must-have CD. If you want to hear a more ""vintage"" Exploited, I highly recommend On Stage."
3,"Fit okay, but looked cheap","These chair covers fit my chairs well and the color was nice, but the fabric looked cheap. Also, I put them on leather chairs and they would not stay put on the leather. Would be better on a fabric upholstered chair. I returned them."
2,disappointed:(,"I am very disappointed. 2 weeks after I ordered my chair covers, Get Organized still had not mailed my covers. I emailed them, and although I received a quick reply, it took another 2 days to mail. I received the covers almost 2 weeks late. Since they obviously made the mistake, I wish I could of received a little money back. It's unacceptable that I have to email them in order to get my chair covers. If I never emailed them I don't think I would have gotten my covers. I do like the color and the fabric works, however the covers are too big and my chairs are normal size (not big and not small, right in the middle). I wish they could make different sizes, because their one size does not fit all. I will never order anything from Get Organized again, and I will advise others not to either."
5,Dining Room Chair Covers,"I just loved these covers, fit perfectly. Very satisfied. Arrived just in time for the holidays and I will continue to use them all year round."
4,Casually festive,"The upholstered seats on my counter stools were filthy and not worth professionally cleaning or re-upholstering. Voila, these covers will be used until my kids master the art of using napkins and not their seat/sleeves/placemats to wipe their messy hands. I can just toss them in the laundry and put them back on."
3,Just ok I guess,"The seller was great and shipped quickly, but this item is just ok. As others have mentioned the fabric is very thin, so its more cosmetic to cover an already dirty chair than to protect a new clean chair.I purchased the sage color and the color itself is very nice. I just wish the fabric itself was more substantial."
3,Nice but you can tell they're cheap,"I bought these to cover some old ripped dining chairs for a ""college"" style apartment, and while they are absolutely better than the chairs with the rips in the upholstery, you can definitely tell they are very cheap fabric. For the price, I guess they're okay but next time I would spend more for better quality."
5,Quality tasteful product for the price,"It is 1000% better material, color and construction wise compared to the cheap, shiny, polyester alternatives you'd find at Bed Bath Beyond."
4,Good Stuff,"These chair slipcovers do the trick - and do it well. They're made of fairly substantial cottom fabric, they're easy to get on, and easy to tie up in back - which helps you gather in any excess fabric. The final result looks classy and not fussy - at least on my chairs - and the price is a bargain."
4,Good product,The covers are in their described condition (though need a good ironing before use!) and add a nice touch to our eat-in kitchen. Fit perfectly over our chairs.
3,nice material and well made but easily slip off seat....,I like this material and the design but they slip off our seats too easily (when someone slides on or off the seat). I am considering stapling them under the chair so they will not slip off. Perhaps our chair seats are larger then most... The material is nice but not very thick so if I staple them I will place some layer of cloth to protect the seat from liquids... :-)
1,frightening,"I have to say that the description ""A sleeveless top with pink cotton bodice and transparent pink vinyl waist and shoulder panels shows off her minuscule waist."" is very upsetting. What are we teaching the children?"
3,More detail and information...,"Overall, I found the *Original Citroen DS : Restorer's Guide to All DS and ID Models 1955-75* more congenial to my tastes and focus, but I'd buy this one too. The overlap between the two is considerable, but they are complementary and both of high utility to those who love, as I do, the Deesse."
3,Their ok.,"I'm a 14 quadruple wide shoe size. Did these fit? Yes, more or less. But I'm also flat footed, so that raise in the center caused me serious pain due to my lack of an arch.The only other thing I can say about them is that they make your sneakers feel heavier than I anticipated."
3,Its an OK Insole.,"Compared with the original total support from spenco, this gel based insoles are pretty ok for your every day needs."
3,it is ok,not terribly comfortable.. i have had better.. it is also heavy.. would not buy again. I got is for comfort of standing all day and want to stand on a comfortable cloud.. this is not it
3,Run a little big,They are fairly comfortable but they run a little big. I would order down one size for anyone getting these in the future. They are as comfortable as the $50 Dr. Scholls though.
4,Can't complain for the price,"Overall good value for money, good thick construction on heel but maybe too thin throughout the rest of the sole. Little bigger than size selected, but cut to fit."
5,Best Insole's Yet!,I have always felt spur pain in my heals for several years and after a couple of weeks it is just about gone.
3,just a basic insole,"build quality is excellent. insoles have a ""hi-tech"" look. i'm pleased with 15 min walk. but when wearing all day long it's nothing but a basic insoles. nothing special. my merrell's ""stock"" insoles have more cushioning and support than this.will not buy again."
3,comfortable but not long lasting,I purchased these insoles for work and they were great in the comfort factory. My only issue with them is after a few weeks the fabric on the top of them started to bunch up and peel back in places.
3,Original storyline for a zombie flick - horrible editing!,"I want to give this a higher rating, it had such potential and an original storyline even for a zombie movie. There's no blood and gore here, really, but an interesting concept that goes about an hour too long.The characters have zero depth and in some cases are just plain bizarre, the script is weak, and the editing... I actually laughed out loud a couple times, it was just too much. I love B movies and can almost always forgive amateur production quality, but this really went too far.I hope someone with some talent picks this up and rewrites, recasts, and remakes it."
1,this movie 'BLOWS',"don't waste your money on this movie, I ended up tossing it in the trash .. it really sucked ..it was trash!!!!!"
3,Canadian Zombies?,"For about hour or so I thought this was a bad Australian movie, but it turned out to be a bad Canadian movie. There were some likable characters - ordinary people risking their lives to help other ordinary people. I see a lot of movies where I really don't care if the monsters win, but in this case the humans were tolerable."
1,The Zombies should have eaten this movie before it was released.,One of the worst zombie movies I have ever seen. Another example of beating a genre to death. Weak plot. About 90 minutes longer than it needed to be.
1,Very boring movie....,"I actually like cheesy, poorly produced vampire movies. So I thought this movie would be along those lines. However, this movie was so slow and boring for a huge majority. There weren't even zombies for the entire first half of the movie. I will be fair and say that I've never read the books, so perhaps if I had read them this movie would have been more to my liking and I might have been able to give it more stars then."
2,Sheesh what happened to the zombies? They all forgot they were zombies.,"Not much of a horror movie really. The fact that the zombie first start out as little ""pet me"" creatures was novel. But it took too long, in fact 7/8th of the movie before the zombies wake up and start acting like zombies, but then the movie is over... Oh well, at least it kept the non-zombie actors safe. Outside of that there is not much tension to get the movie plot revved up to be an action movie nor a horror movie. It was more like a ""Once upon a time movie, when all world fell asleep and woke up zombies except a few"". Could have done alot more with this movie and since the director did not want to have mean zombies, he or she could have saved the movie by taking it down a humorous avenue."
1,Horrible,"This movie is really really bad. It was filmed bad, takes away from the book and you have no idea whats happening. NOT WORTH IT"
3,"Ok, thats all......just ok","Nothing new, everything has been done in similar fashion by many film companies. It was visually entertaining and I enjoy the lead actor and just about everything I have seen him in. His presence alone made the movie worth watching and I do recommend the movie. Everyone went through their paces quite well and I enjoyed the movie ok..nothing great, nothing bad and certainly worth the rental."
2,got bored...,"i like zombie movies, i like horror movies, and yes, i like human interests movies. But somehow, this ""walking dead"" wannabee just did not work for me. i walked away after a half hour. Really, i would want my 1.99 back and the 1/2 hour of my life, but it ain't gonna happen. nice box art though."
3,"Good premise, amateurish filmmaking","This could have been an excellent film, my wife and I both thought the premise was good/sound, refreshingly different than other zombie movies, but the actual filming was amateurish, dialogue was difficult to understand (a little heavy on the accents, w/ mumbling aplenty), lighting was horrid in so many scenes, I can't count on my fingers and toes the number of scenes we just couldn't see because the lighting was so terrible, and this on a 53"" widescreen HDTV, at night. The ending of this movie seemed vague, as if it hadn't actually ended, or shouldn't have ended yet. The movie was OK, but it could have been so much better. -kd5-"
2,Waste of time,"Poor camera work, worse acting, a flimsy budget and a storyline that leaves much to be desired. One reviewer compared this movie to 28 Days Later, but the only similarities I can find is that they are both are films and they both involve a virus of some sort affecting most of the population. This is an incredibly boring movie, maybe moreso than any movie I've ever seen, and its attempts at being emotionally and psychologically captivating fall very short. Fans of the novel(s) will be sorely disappointed."
2,Too Bad They Didn't Have A Bigger Budget,"Flesh eating zombie movies are always about the people trying to survive a zombie outbreak. If there's an exception, I haven't seen it. Autumn focuses almost entirely on the humans. The zombies don't even pose a threat till sometime well into the second half. It's also a very low budget film with no great actors, make up, effects or action. Instead, this is an opportunity for a bunch of young film makers and actors to test their wings. I don't expect any of these young people to become household names, but this is still a decent effort. Better action would have made this a much more watchable movie, but I still liked it. Many scenes are very effective. Carradine must have appeared for moral support and to lend his name to help sell this film. If he got paid and his fee robbed the film makers of the money to make a better movie, they screwed up. I never heard of the novel. Maybe I'll read it someday."
4,So close to being a great film,"I am not a fan of zombies that move at warp speed. I'm old enough to have seen the original Night of the Living Dead at a drive-in when it was first released and I consider the original Dawn Of The Dead the best zombie movie ever made. After that one, zombie films went downhill.I really liked Autumn's different take on zombies. They start off as lumbering and harmless, then very slowly begin regaining motor control, becoming more dangerous as the movie progresses. Yes, it's slow in spots, the acting isn't great, some of the camera work is confusing and the dialog is muddied and hard to follow at times, but the movie does have a certain creep factor going for it because you never know how dangerous the zombies actually are at any given time. I hope some other film makers pick up on the slow-progressing zombie theme. It really has potential if done right."
1,Boring,"I found this movie to be quite boring and poorly crafted despite the positive reviews on this site and online. It seems like a college student's attempt at a zombie movie set in England. If you expect quality writing, acting, and filming as seen in TV's ""The Walking Dead"" then you will be disappointed with this flick."
4,Good primer,"Nicely written intro to the Iraq War, brief but with enough detail to allow readers to begin to understand the ""war"" phase, prior to the ""insurgency"" phase. Could have used a few more maps. Good photos too. Very little, however, about strategy, esp. that coming from the White House and higher ups. Isn't that part of war too?"
3,Decent Overview,"The Iraq War is a decent overview of the recent war in Iraq. It's strongest points are made in the early chapters where the authors attempt to put the war in context. ""Origins of War"" and ""The Opposing Sides"" are the best summaries I've seen on the build up and causes of the war -- from Saddam's duplicity to the UNs fecklessness, Murray and Scales provide an outstanding background as to why war occurred. The summary on the ground war was adequate, while the chapter on the air war was relatively weak and uninspired. The most disappointing aspect of the book was its lack of insightful post-war analysis and impact of the war on our future military capabilities.But, all in all, the book is a good read and well worth the cost for the outstanding pre-war analysis."
5,Quite A Journey Indeed!,"This album is a bit of a deviation from the classic commercial rock Journey fans are used to! It features smooth Angelic high notes hit by the amazing Steve Perry. Nothing new about that, but in this moving piece of music he actually soars to even greater hights. Neil Schon, Journey guitarist, plays a beautiful guitar solo capable of producing goose bumps on the most jaded of listeners, myself included. Flowing strings and tasty compositions make this album a must have for ANY Journey fan."
3,One Glove?,"Glove is okay; however, I still can't understand why they sell one glove at a time. The price was good for a pair of gloves, but for only one. When I complained, they offered free return, which I opted for. Then they decided it would be easier just to let me keep it and refund payment. People considering this product should be aware that it is only one glove -- not two as the picture shows."
4,Carving gloves,"Good fit , work as described. They do protect you from minor cuts and nicks derived from whittling and carving"
5,mama loves it,i have followed usher's career since he was 15 and i was 14 when this album first came out i loved it then and i love it now he has amazing skills on the mic ultimate sex appeal and a gorgeous face. he worked with the best because he is the best this is for those that love the sound of early r&b and those die hard usher fans because this is where it all started i give it 8 stars and a rub down i bought it when it first came out in 1994 it was stolen and my heart was broken but years later im buying it again ladies i urge you to buy this album you will not be disapointed.i hope i helped you all my love and kisses kim ''tha unforgettable one
2,ONLY BUY IF YOU WANT TO HEAR USHER AS A KID.,I BOUGHT THIS DISK FROM A LOCAL STORE BECAUSE IT HAD A RECENT PHOTO OF USHER AND IT WAS RELEASED IN 2000. I THOUGHT IT WAS SOME NEW MUSIC HE RELEASED. BUT WHEN I LISTENED TO THE DISK IT WAS HIM AS A KID. I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU BUY IT UNLESS YOU WANT TO HEAR USHER AS A CHILD.
1,"Don't order this,","This is not worth your money. I ordered this for my father as he is a big Red Skelton fan. I thought it would have skits of the old shows with the focus on the skits that ""Red"" was in. It is 5 DVDs of the Red Skelton Shows, and you have to watch the whole show, and there was very little skits of Red Skelton in it. I was very disappointed in this, and so was my father."
5,Le générique de Daniel Mermet à Saint-Petersbourg en 1994,"Des pas qui crissent dans la neige et Daniel Mermet me fait découvrir, sur France Inter, dans ""Là-bas... si j'y suis"", ce chef-d'oeuvre de Shostakovich :""La #7, dite ""Leningrad""..."
3,The Very Best of Al B. Sure...,"Favorite song on this disc was the ""special edition"" of ""If I'm not your lover"" by Al B. Sure featuring ""Slick Rick."" I actually memorized that song - and had fun doing it! Overall, I rate the disc three stars!"
5,Great story,"This is simply a great book. The characters are people you care about (even the duck), and you want them to succeed. It's like the ultimate road trip of adventure in the heart of a war. Lindberg uses the river motif to great effect, like Conrad and Apocalypse Now, and when he's done you can't wait to read the next one in the series."
5,Traffic Jam,This movie is a more of an adventure family film in japanese with english subtitles. If you like Takeshi Kitano films or just japanese films i think you will like this.
2,Nothing to get excited about.,"I have had great luck with Naxos recordings. I have been able to get a lot of outstanding music at a bargain price over the years. This CD is one of the few disappointments I've encountered. My primary complaint is the heavy-handed execution of the pieces. It seems that the artist is ""punching"" the notes out, and this approach becomes tiresome after a while. In comparison, similar material played by Philip Martin on the Hyperion label seems to float out, and at his hands the music becomes seductive. While Martin's recording costs substantially more, it is definitely worth the extra price."
4,Coffee on the go,"I got this coffee maker for the obvious reason I guess which is to be able to make something fast and carry it out the door. So far it has worked well for me. It is a sturdy made unit, very easy to use, and the cups and filters are dish washer friendly. My only complaint is that the travel mug could be a little wider at the bottom so that it fits more snuggly in my car cup holder. As is, it's a little wobbly."
1,Poor Quality,One of the mugs bases broke off within the first month of purchasing this coffee maker. And when I make two cups of coffee one mug only brews half of a cup and the other a full cup. Really strange. I contacted the company to complain to try to get a replacement but they never answered my email. I would skip this one and go for another brand.
2,cheap cheap cheap,"First of all, the tumblers included are USELESS. The lids don't create a seal and they provide zero insulation. You get to both burn your fingers AND dribble down your shirt at the same time. Fun. Luckily, most standard-size travel mugs fit just fine.As for the maker itself, it makes decent coffee for a while. After about 3 months of usage, though, the left side started to clog up. If you try to make two cups of coffee now, the left side mug is about 2/3 full, and the right side is overflowing. I understand that one must clean a coffee maker occasionally, but to become unusable after 2 months?Finally, the build quality is poor, and it just feels cheap. If you saw this on a shelf at Target, you would probably pass by. The trouble with online shopping."
2,Black & Decker coffeemaker,"Well, i will say that the concept of brewing a travel mug or two at a time is phenomenal. However, these ""travel mugs"" are not the type with screw on lids, they actually are warped and will leak on your lap, not a great experience. I now use it only for brewing and then transfer the coffee into a travel mug that I purchased from Starbucks."
3,good but not great,"I got this coffee maker for Christmas and have used it about 20 times now. No mechanical problems yet but coffee does not seem to taste quite right.Pros: The permanent filter makes it easy to use and clean. Brewing only 16 oz will keep me from drinking too much coffee. This is a good think because I need to cut back.Cons: There is a strange smell when it nears the end of the brewing cycle. I think it may be the smell of plastic overheating but not melting. It could be my imagination but it seems that the coffee has a hint of this ""plastic"" taste too."
2,BAD TASTE ON COFFEE,"AFTER USING IT FOR ALMOST TWO MONTHS I CANT GET RID OF THE BAD TASTE ON THE COFFEE, I;VE TRIED CLEANING IT WITH VINEGAR AND OVER N OVER WITH PLAIN WATER BUT THE COFFEE STILL TASTE LIKE PLASTIC.I DONT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO ANYMORE. ANY ONE HAS IDEAS??"
1,If you're thinking of buying this coffeemaker......DON'T DO IT,"I received this dual cup coffeemaker as a gift along with a basket of specialty coffee. The first time I used it I selected single cup and it worked fine. However, when using the dual cup selector, 75% of the coffee goes to one cup and 25% to the other. The result is coffee all over your counter. I tried this several times with the same result. I wish I knew where it was purchased because I would return it ASAP. More than likely I will throw it away. JUNK !"
1,Not too good,"Worked for about two weeks, then quit. When it did work, it was noisy, slow, leaky, and threw off a lot of steam. It's a great concept because I'm caffeinated and my wife's not, but not really worth the purchase price. I bought a Hamilton Beach 14 oz. coffee/tea/hot water maker and love it -- for five dollars less!"
2,Lasted exactly 365 days before breaking,"Rec'd last Christmas & officialy broke the morning of 12/26 this year. The plastic base on the cups cracks easily. W/in a couple of months water began to creep into the space between the sleeve & the silver exterior of each cup. The insulating property of these is zip so you have to drink your coffee fast if you want it hot. The final straw was the plastic switch topside, to change from one cup to two, apparently has broke & now water pours from both sides whether you want one cup or two. Upon close inspection it appears this switch has a glass or brittle plastic rod which fractured. BUT, very easy to use, very easy to clean, great if you & significant other like different coffees. We haven't ruled out purchasing another."
3,Good enough,"I just bought this item for $20. I thought since I only drink 1-2 cups a day, this would do and I could share if I had company. The coffee comes out steaming and the flavor is fine. It is easy to use, but the knob on the top does seem flimsy, so I followed someone else's suggestion and am keeping it on 2 cups and run water through to the 2nd cup. The cups are the problem in my opinion. They hold plenty of liquid and keep the coffee fairly warm for the duration, but the lid does not stay on very tight and whether you leave it on or take it off to drink, the lip of the rim is a little too wide and makes it difficult to drink without dribbling. I guess my suggestion would be to make the coffee and then pour into a better cup. Like I said, good enough for my purposes for the money."
5,Works great!,"Received this coffeemaker as a Christmas gift in 2007 and I love it! It's perfect for my on the go lifestyle.I have not experienced the negative aspects that other reviewers have. My coffee tastes great, never like plastic. I use high quality coffee and grind my own beans. The cup doesn't leak. It brews consistently, completely and hot. I was given this coffee maker because I could never figure out how to brew half a pot into a big 8 or 10 cup coffee maker.The only cons I would have to say is the quality of construction. The plastic ""maker"" is light, meaning that it doesn't feel solid on my counter. The cups are not as well insulated as others I have used...it would be better if they were stainless steel on the inside.Great for the price!"
2,Only one side works...,"Black & Decker DDCM200 Dual Personal Coffeemaker, Black and StainlessUnfortunately, after opening the receiver of this gift did not keep the box, receipt, etc...Once we plugged it in and filled it up and turned it on, well it will only successfully fill one mug up with coffee. The other mug only gets about half way full. Have many times to reconfigure, but to no avail it simply will only fill one cup successfully.Should have stuck with the one mug maker."
3,Black & Decker Personal Coffeemaker,"I had a Marlitta brand and the tops on that as well as the B&D coffeemakers stainless mugs wouldn't stay on tight to the mugs due to expansion/contraction because of the temperature differences. What good is a coffee travel mug with a top that won't stay on? Or try taking a drink out of the mug and, if you're not looking, the top falls off when you tilt it to take a drink and it spills all over you. Also on the B&D brand, the brew basket on the single mug side of the coffeemaker doesn't click shut like the one on the other side. What's that?"
1,Cheap coffee cups that spill,"I thought it would be great deal to get two coffee mug and and coffee maker with this price.The cup was too cheap and coffee spills while you drink...(If you are on the way to work and trying to drink coffee with this cup, you will end up with coffee stain on your shirts.)I clean out couple times but still have smell I cannot seem to get rid of...I gave up using it and just bought new regular coffee maker.I will just buy good travle mug and pour them to the cup."
2,stupid,I can't tell you how many messes I've made and much water/coffee wasted cause I forgot two switch the cup selection from 2 Cups to 1 Cup and visa versa.
2,Leaky cups,"I loved the concept of this coffee maker...and I love the coffee it brews. However, I don't love the leaky cups. Water gets trapped between the stainless part and the plastic piece on the bottom of the cup - leaving me with drips all over the place. And it kind of defeats the purpose if you can't use the cups it came with. I was very disappointed in that part of the product."
4,Cutting edge arrangements,"I've actually owned this album for many years. Gil plays with a bunch of hungry young New York musicians in the early 1980's and pushes the envelope. Horns, synthesizers, gritty guitars, vocals. Some arrangements keep close to the original Hendix but most have unique interpretations. I love this CD."
2,"""Bizarre"" doesn't even begin to describe it...","It's weird, wacky and essential for collectors of the peculiar. The two-star ranking applies only to the musical arrangements - the intro to ""Voodoo Chile"" has to be heard to be believed; it rates a big five stars for concept. I don't know if the CD has the original liner notes that the LP had - I just ordered it today - but, if they are correct, Hendrix was supposed to record with Gil and his Orchestra shortly after the Isle of Wight Festival, but he died before the session could happen. If this recording is any indication, the result of Jimi recording with them would have been weird deluxe. But if you're really into the truly strange, this is another disc that belongs in your collection. Superb musicianship in an extremely odd context; I can't believe this has been reissued on CD!"
2,"I've Never Done This Before, But Let Me Tell You How.","Three contributers, three more ""experts"" trying to tell us how to do something that they have never done themselves.A lot of references and notable people and companies are mentioned, but where is the real hands-on ""How to do it?""This book is a story book and should be classified as FICTION.This trio are writers, not ""Lean Manufacturing"" implementers."
3,What about the detail?,"The book is a good overview, but lacks the details necessary to implement. It is obvious that the authors have never implemented Kaizen themselves!"
3,Good second book.,"Mr. Laria has compiled an interesting book that certainly should be read by those contemplating using kaizen blitzes. It is enlightening and when combined with the ""Kaizen Event Implementation Manual"" makes a complete, theory to actual application set."
5,ENTER THE TWILIGHT ZONE.,"THIS HAS SOME OF THE STORIES THAT BELONG TO FUTURE HISTORY, BUT OVERALL A COLLECTION OF INTERESTING AND ODD STORIES. AT ONE ONE POINT YOU WONDER IF ROD STERLING WILL POP OUT SOMEWHERE TO INTRODUCE TODAY'S EPISODE. DEFINITELY WORTH READING."
5,"Heartbreaking, honest storytelling","""We Were Here"" accomplishes something wonderful in an understated way. Using the voices of witnesses to the AIDS outbreak in San Francisco, the film brings the shared memories of an epidemic to life. Never preachy, never sentimental, but always emotionally honest, this work forms a ground for understanding with powerful storytelling reminiscent of the Civil Rights documentary series ""Eyes on the Prize"". Highly recommended."
1,Poor fit,"Installed these in a 2008 Nissan Aramada. These have the same issue that the front liners have, namely Husky didn't do their homework. On the Armada the door sills are actually a little below the carpet level, so when you install these you are left with a raised edge that sticks up to catch the feet of anyone entering the truck. Add in the fact that the raised edge has these super sharped nubs (intended to keep them from sliding around) and you have the potential for some serious damage to kids feet. The Twee One has already caught her feet a couple of times getting into the truck. Seriously NOT RECOMMENDED for Armada owners. If you take a look at the stock photo real close (use the larger image) you can actually see the raised nubs sticking out."
5,"Runs small, but is a BIG hit at any event!","My son is 10 months old, he wears 12 month size clothing. I ordered 18 months to be safe, but it ended up being way too small. I returned and reordered the 24 month size. The customer service at Dress Me Up Cute is awesome, they were very helpful and got our reorder to us just in time for our sister's wedding. This outfit is sooo adorable and our son was the hit of the wedding. I shopped all over for an old fashioned baby boy outfit like this, and Amazon is the only place I was able to find one. We are extremely happy with our purchase!"
2,doll clothing?,I bought this for my sons 6 month pictures. I read the other reviews that it runs small so I got a 12 month size for my son who is 22lbs. It wasn't right. Too small in someareas and too big in others. The shirt was so thin and didn't tuck into the pants and the sleaves were too long. He was so uncomfortable we had to take it off and use a white onesie. The pants fit the suspenders barely fit almost too small. The hat was a little too big and a disappointment as it was floppy with no firm brim. The clip on tie was a joke that didn't stay on for a second. Over all we were able to get a few pictures but I was hoping for something just a little better. If he were supposed to wear this for a whole day ot would never have worked out. The over all outfit seemedlike it was sewn for dollclothing not human baby clothes. I wouldn't buy this again.
4,So cute for pictures,"We ordered the 9 month size for a cute Thanksgiving outfit while together with family. Husband said ""let's grab it for his 6 month pictures and thank god we did. It hardly fit! When he sat, the buttoned shirt would gap and his tummy showed. We had to edit it out of the pictures, but everything else fit fine. The bow tie was hard to keep straight while baby was moving around, but all in all this was SO CUTE! There was a tear in the leg of the knickers right out of the package, but totally fine, as we only used it for pictures."
3,Cute Idea,"Outfit is ok, i wasnt too excited about the material/finish of it though, don't think i would have paid almost $50 dlls for this (after shipping and handling) if i would have seeing it at the store and felt the material...But over all the whole idea of the outfit was cute; i'm planning on using this for my son's 2nd birthday, don't think he'll wear it again after this, it's a cute one-time wear outfit, it'd be a good one for a vintage photo shoot as well..."
3,Cute,"This was sooo adorable. I thought the shirt was small and the suspeneders were more cute than functional. Its more for cuteness than anything. On that note they hit the nail on the head,"
2,Suspenders did not hold up,"This outfit was perfect. My 17 month old son was a ring bearer in my sister-in-law's wedding and this outfit was so cute. Per other reviews, I did order a size larger and the fit was good. My son is in the 50th percentile for weight and height, so I do recommend ordering a size up. My issue is with the suspenders. The clasps did not stay in place. The clasp for the back broke within the hour he had the outfit on before the wedding and as he moved around the other clasps would come undone. We had to use safety pins to keep them in place until the wedding was over. No one was any the wiser, but imagine trying to put safety pins on a very active, rambunctious 17 month old boy. Not fun."
4,A sure winner!!,I absolutely love it!!!!! I have been looking for an outfit like this for a while I am so thrilled to have gotten this~
5,This outfit was a hit for Halloween,"This darling outfit was used for my son's halloween costume. We dressed him up as ""Bagger Vance"". People were running up to us, asking us to stop so they could see his outfit. The quality of the clothing was great, the outfit fit true to size (18mos). This just what I expected and the delivery was QUICK. We are going to have professional holiday portraits taken in this for the grandparents."
1,Shoddy and disappointing,"Disappointing purchase. Cheap fabric, threads sticking out all over suggest shoddy construction. Suspenders have gold thread (which is not apparent in the online photo) - they look feminine and tacky. Brim of hat has no support sewn into it, so it's very flimsy. Neither the hat nor the pants are lined and the fabric is very thin. I don't expect this outfit to withstand more than one laundering. I agree with the comments re:sizing. I ordered a size 3T, which should fit my son who is wearing 24-mo. to 2T. If you like the style of this outfit, you'd be better off buying a good pair of trousers that fit your baby or child and have them tailored into knickers. I bought a nicer quality newsboy cap recently at Gymboree, but I've seen them in other retail stores, too."
2,Waaay too small,"The sizes on this outfit really do run quite small. We had a wedding to go to and wanted our little guy to look cute. The outfit was on him, a little snug, but our son is in the 95 percentile for height so we are accustomed to things not quite fitting (we typically leave a button or two undone or something). This outfit seemed fine while I had my son laying on his back and all buttoned up. But when I picked him up he started turning red in the face and couldn't breathe. I ripped the clip on bow-tie off immediately and he immediately gasped a huge breath and started crying. Of course I felt awful for forcing the outfit on ... I layed him down to start taking the outfit off when he pealed into another scream... the suspenders had come lose in back and the metal had dug into his skin (even through the shirt). I should have bought the 9 month size for my 3 month old!! I felt aweful and my poor son felt worse."
5,Beautiful Prints,"I have a Canon IP3000 and had no problems using this paper. Unlike many reviewers, I am very satisfied with the quality and even the size. The size is 4x6.5, but it's a benefit really, because you don't end up touching the photo when it has finished printing. Instead of smudging the ink or leaving a fingerprint on the photo that extra room along the side or bottom helps... and can easily be cut away later. My pictures look as perfect as they did on the days they were taken and to me, that is satisfying enough to earn it 5 stars."
5,Very good paper,"This is great paper for photos! For those not using a Kodak printer (which are also very highly recommended), the extra length is not a problem - you just need to format your own printer, using directions from Kodak's website. The extra space allows for easier handling if you do not want finger smudges on your beautiful prints. Perforations are there so that you can tear off the excess paper.These prints last so long, and the paper is Kodak quality, producing great pictures!"
1,Not really 4x6,"I don't know if it's just the pack of paper I got, but these sheets of photo paper are not really 4x6. They're more like 3.5x7. This is extremely annoying when trying to print to 4x6 because it cuts off the top of the picture and then leaves white space on the end of the picture. For it to work you have to change your printer settings and even then, the quality is not that great. I wouldn't suggest this product to anyone. Try Cannon, HP or Epson paper. Much better quality!"
2,Duhh! Why print 4x6 when it is 4x6.5,"This makes no sense. If the industry standard is 4x6, why did they, Kodak, cut the paper to 4x6.5 and then advertise on the carton that it is 4x6 -- yes, I see the fine print on the back side of the carton that reads ""actual paper size is 4x6.5""I still don't understand why they did this.Now I have cut the pictures down to the correct size...what a waste of my time!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Noticeably worse than canon paper with my MP500,"I just got a Canon MP500 and bought some of this paper because it was clearance priced and I assumed it would be good. I printed a photo on both this and the sample canon glossy 4x6 paper that came with my printer. The canon paper print looked like it came from a photo lab. The kodak paper had print lines visible, the layers of ink were clearly visible, and less detail was visible. I would recommend those with canon printers to stay far away from this paper. At least I didn't spend too much on the paper."
2,I'm not impressed...,"I bought this paper to use with my Canon i550 printer and there was a HUGE difference in quality between the Kodak paper and the Canon Photo Paper Plus Glossy that came with my printer. The Canon paper delivered spectacular photo-quality results, while the Kodak ""glossy"" paper gave me somewhat of a matte print. Side-by-side, there was more of a grainy texture to the Kodak paper, whereas the Canon paper was very even and flawless. On Kodak's defense, I do think that the printer/paper combo makes a big difference. Perhaps Kodak paper is simply not compatible with Canon printers. However, I expected better quality from Kodak, since they are the picture experts! I'll stick with Canon paper for now..."
2,Inferior results,"This paper yields inferior results when used with an Epson C84 printer and Epson Durabrite inks. The layers of ink are clearly visible; on some prints there appears to be a ""crackle"" finish.Epson paper results are consistently excellent."
2,Not a good Demi Glace,This brand of demi glace has no flavor and is very watery even when cooked down. A good demi glace should have lots of flavor with a syrupy consistency. A spoonful should even go along way. This one fails.
4,A very useful demi-glace,"This is a rich and flavorful demi-glace. To be sure, it's not as thick and gloppy as some, having a more stock-like consistency. Yet, it does a great job of enriching a wide variety of sauces."
5,"Earthy, yet plush Purcell","Purcell is well represented on Naxos, both in quality recordings/performances, and unbeatable prices. Here is a lively,characterful and remarkably authentic sounding account of Purcell's very loose re-working of Midsummer Night's Dream. The singing is almost exclusively high-quality, infused with character and humour, with a deceptively live and spontaneous feel. The orchestration has an earthily authentic quality which suggests period instruments such as viols, though none are credited. If you want a warm, spontaneous-sounding, beautiful dollop of Purcell's songs and instrumental music, you can't possibly go wrong here: it provides a similar comfort factor to dark chocolate. Sink into it, and enjoy!"
1,Irritating conjecture,"Based on rumor and second hand sources, this book does a hack job of Johnson's life. I guess it sells books to say that a man was gay, with only the vitriol of his ex wife as a source. Don't waste a dime on this book."
2,disillusioned,Sadly I bought this book for my 80+ mother who was a Van Johnson fan. It's description of him totally destroyed her admiration of him.
1,Don't spend a dime on this book~ AWFUL AND UNFAIR TREATMENT,"I have to say I bought this book hoping to find at least an ounce of truth in it. I found none. It was slanted and very unfair. All the author does is dwell on the bad in no way remotley shows Van for the man he is. It's a shame it was published while he is alive but is what I would expect from the RELIGOUS FANATICS TODAY, WHO ARE BY THE WAY HYPOCRITES~ Don't buy the book-get his DVD's and watch his films. Shame on you Ronald Davis, biggot!"
3,An Unfair Accounting,"Although I was born about the time of Van Johnson's rising star, being a movie buff of ole films, I have enjoyed his movies so much through the years. His warmth and boy next door charm seemed to always add something very special to the movies he was in. Having read Ronald Davis's accounting of his life, however, left me feeling very frustrated at times over Mr. Davis' determination to state Van Johnson's sexual preference with the very slimmest of evidence to back it up. He begins the book and ends it with the same proposition, and because I did not find his book so well researched or definitive, I think the jury is still out on this one. Ronald Davis' writing often seemed like fan magazine articles pieced together. Having loved Van Johnson for many years as a screen star, I am sad that there is not more out there of greater quality to read on his life."
3,I'm amazed at the man,"The writing was well done. I was surprised to find Van Johnson was such a sad man, HE kept himself walled off from family and potential friends. His indifference to his daughter, was the sadest of all, he missed an opportunity for almost unconditional love. I'll still enjoy his movies, but pity the man."
3,Webkinz Trading Cards,This product is exactly as stated. Getting a whole box help us to collect the entire set. Plus we were able to get a free Webkinz pet and some doodlez cards.
3,Trading cards series 1,"This booster box was exciting to open, but the codes weren't all that great.Codes:I got some rares, kinzcash, a free pet, and even a recipe food! Come on!Cards:The cards were pretty nice, but there were a couple sets of duplicates. The rare cards were really neat, especially with a holofoil backround. If you are buying one booster box of webkinz cards, this is a good one to get first because its cheap and has good cards and prizes for a first booster box. Overall, this booster box was ok, but not the best.The special items you can only get from this series are:Classic gamers theme (uncommon)tcg posters (uncommon)zangoz and zingoz dicekinz pack (uncommon)Series 1 trading card theme (rare)This series has much less special code-only items from the cards than series 2."
4,Webkinz Trading Cards Review,"The webkinz cards are fun to open! They offer many different online codes on each card that allow you to access special items, Kinzcash, and even the chance of obtaining another virtual pet!"
5,Fun addition to webkinz online,"My daughter and I play webkinz together online and I just purchased these **Series 1 cards. She loves the surprise of opening a package to see what game cards she got as well as how many codes. Each box of 36 packets has 5 cards and 1 code card per packet. Each code card has up to 4 codes listed as well as 1 code for a virtual pack of cards for your pets room. So far the packets we have opened only have one ""free"" item code along with the virtual pack.This week my girl chose to accept the Webkinz cards in leau of her allowance for chores. I am planning on giving these as a Birthday party treat at the end of her B-day! Great little gifts and incentives-love it!"
2,Not enough help,"This book came up a little light. I really didn't learn anything new or enlightening.If you have just started to follow racing, it could be a help. But not if you have been following and handicapping for years."
4,This was fun.,"It's interesting to see this kind of independent documentary happen. The answer to the question the compiler asked seemed obvious to me though: which is, why was the writing I did in my youth so awful? Answer: you thought emulating Bukowski and drinking a lot while you wrote was going to make good output, and it doesn't. So the premise of the documentary was a bit flawed to begin with. But it was certainly fun to get the sensation of seeing the scenes with writers reading their work."
3,meh,"The movie like many MFA programs is too self involved to ever be very much fun. And I'm not against exploring a subject deeply, in a very self involved way, but it seems to do it with a very uninteresting muse. But you get to see cool writers."
1,rip off,"The chart is a small (letter size) plastified sheet. It contains the names of the processes and the subprocesses. Per subprocess it includes references to input and output subprocesses (e.g. SU2, IP2, et cetera). On the back some terms and definitions are explained.Anyone can create a similar chart just by putting the information contained in the OGC manual in to a powerpoint sheet and printing this on a color printer. In fact this excercise is recommended as preperation for the Prince2 exams."
5,Excellent condition for an old book,"Excellent condition. This book was published in the 1950s and it brings wonderful memories of my grandmother. There are in torn pages, stains or anything! Very happy with my purchase."
4,Anna wanted a difficult childhood,"I read this book when I was barely older than Anna, and read it again when my boys were her age. Anna wants to be a writer, and has heard that a writer must have a difficult childhood. Early on, she and her brother Max are allowed to choose one toy apiece to leave home with. Instead of her beloved Pink Rabbit, she chooses a brand-new stuffed toy. This decision is deeply regretted because the new one has no personality, and she deeply misses the comfort of her battered old toy. In the end, the plot is as predictable as one of her brother's language exercises, but much more satisfying.I think Lee Child must have read this book too, because remembering Pink Rabbit made the adumbrations in one of his Reacher books starkly obvious."
4,Brain Illnesses,Excellent book but a lot of words and phrases were definately meant to be read by a doctor or a psych!
4,Interesting and good,"Reading this book, as well as the others about the case, kept my interest. I enjoyed the information on each page."
3,Bone Garden is interesting,"Fascinating story of a California serial killer who managed to slip out of being convicted for most of her crimes over a long period of time. Writing is somewhat stilted and doesn't flow as smoothly as could be, but still better than many real crime story books. Photos are bad and would have made the book better if they had purchased some better pictures from Sacramento Bee or other sources. It was worth reading, particularly if you follow the story of Dorthea Montalvo Puente."
2,pass on this one,"not nearly as anti-fog as expected, not very comfortable, expensive for what you get, below usual ""DeWalt"" quality level"
3,"Looks cool, very durable... but fogs up!","I use these goggles with a face mask while sharpening metal, and I have a couple issues with them.Firstly, it may just be the shape of my face, but I do not feel like these provide much protection from the lower side angles.Secondly, I have a lot of fogging trouble while wearing these. The cheaper pair of safety goggles that I wanted to replace with this product actually do better.Otherwise, these are comfy and look good and feel like they are built to last. Perhaps they are just not made for my head."
3,*Read This*,"The glasses are mediocre, comfortable and scratch easily. What we have in this instance, once again, is the classic advertising trick. The product reads ""fog resistant."" This product actually is ""fog resistant"" with one small detail the manufacturer/marker forgot to mention: that they are not resistant to the physical change of water as a vapor into the enevitible water droplets! Water will form on these glasses and distort your vision. I would recommed these glasses for woodworking in a climate controlled environment in which the wearer would not have a face mask on. I work in the weather and must wear a balaclava to break the wind and it just doesnt mesh. My breath fogs these glasses in sixty seconds."
1,Not Great,"The description claims that these are anti-fog, they are not. This was the only reason I purchased them, very disappointed."
3,"They dont fog up, but mine got scratched","I've been using these for riding my bike.they stay fairly fog free, but cant really be tossed around a bag or treated roughly. Mine scratched"
2,Not comfortable or well seating,"These glasses do the job of protecting your eyes, but unless you're 6'6"", chances are these glasses are too large for you. They don't adjust well, and seemed to never find a spot to settle into. Just turning my head to sneeze has sent them flying to the floor. Go for the DPG55-11C for better adjustment and comfort."
4,Not quite fog proof,"These are great safety glasses. I would, however, define them as fog resistant as opposed to fog proof. nuff said."
1,What happened?!,"Boom Bip seemed like such a promising project, taking some ""ok"" instrumental hip hop and infusing some real instrument samples and not resorting to noise (recent Prefuse) or inane beats (most instrumental hip hop). Somehow that earlier work morphs into this, an EP that would fit right in at the 99 bin of generic house/techno releases at a record shop. Nothing of note on this album, and even if you DO like music like this, there's other artists who have been doing it better for longer. I can understand artists reinventing themselves, but it's not always for the better -- sometimes, they should've stuck with what worked in the first place."
3,It's ok....,"Yeah, watching the movie was way more enjoyable than listening to the soundtrack. It's just that, there's a lot of dark moody tracks that I had to force myself to listen to. There's some nice tracks scattered throughout mostly in the beginning and later parts of the CD. The compilation song at the end was nice and their performance on stage song was good. I wouldn't recommend this CD unless you really liked the BGM from the movie or you just have to have it go along with you DVD like I did."
2,Dissappointing,"The animal descriptions are very brief and basic. This book might be good for someone with little knowledge of wildlife but doesnt go into much detail on any animal. It also spends too much time on animals that it even states are rarely found in Yellowstone(ie Lynx) and says almost nothing about more common, although less exciting animals(various bird and small mammals)."
3,A good general guide,After buying many books like this I would suggest checking them out of the library for the length of your visit. We did not see the animals in this guide to back up the information and the locations but found it good for basic information about the animals and their habitats etc.
4,Great Resource,A great resource in identifying what you see in the parks. The pictures allow you to see what these animals look like unlike some books where there is just a drawing.
4,Very Helpful,"I found the book to be very helpful. Especially paired with ""Scenic Driving in Yellowstone & Grand Teton"". Other than the cats, we where able to get out early and find the wolves, grizzly, moose etc."
3,Product discription,Well the product description is only partly true. I was hoping to get some real relief from congestion symptoms. And there's a few ingredients listed in the description that are not present in the actual product.
2,chain,"seems of cheap quality and doesnt look very niceNot exactly a high quality necklace, but guess you get what you pay for?"
3,careful,"we've had these for work for years, but you have to be really careful how you put the keys in or the box might jam."
2,It worked great until someone stole it within a month,"Reading all the mixed reviews for such lock boxes, I decided to buy this from my local hardware store thinking that if there were any issues, I'd be able to at least speak to someone and possibly return it. That strategy went out the window when within a month, the lockbox was stolen from the gate it was attached to. I am so lucky that the keys weren't inside by happenstance, but who knows how easily they could have broken into it. I thank my lucky stars we still have the keys."
5,What a great book!,"I loved this book. I read it to 6 different classrooms (grades K and 1) All of them enjoyed it. The two girls, one white and one black, talk about their friendship. Sometimes they like that same things and sometimes they don't. But they are still best friends. I have also purchased this for our church library. It teaches the best way to be a friend without being at preachy. The illustrations are delightful"
5,Great Book about Friends,My daughter loves this book. It shows that friends don't have to be the same or like the same things.
3,Slight draft,Agreeable enough smooth-death incorporates melodic arrangements and shows instrumental know-how but only pulls off a moderately impressive feat.
4,Mystery in the Pocono Mountains,"Frank, Joe and their pal, Chet, are in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountain country to visit a family friend who lives next to spooky ""Black Hollow"". When he turns up missing, it's up to the Boys to find him and solve the mysterious goings-on in Black Hollow.The action in this book is almost non-stop and this story ranks among the best of the later tales.A ""must read"" for all Hardy Boys fans."
4,The cover alone made the book sound spooky,"Sneaking around, discovering what other teens or adults were up to, solving crimes, ahh, I loved this series.I read the entire series as a kid, and loved it. It chronicles two brothers and their friends adventures as they solve mysteries of all imaginable kinds. I only learned as an adult that Franklin W Dixon was a pen name used by several different authors, but the series had some great stories. I still enjoy a good mystery.Paul Buckner,author of ""From Broke to Broker, and other stories of finding financial freedom."""
3,Hardy boys/Double jeopardy,"Travis HewittDouble Jeopardy"" finds the Hardy Boys at the world-famous Indianapolis race track as student reporters covering the American Grand Prix for The Bayport Herald.A long-simmering fued between the two top contenders breaks out into a free-for-all in which the Boys get involved.Later one of the contenders wrecks his car, then disappears and his rival is blamed.The Hardy Boys investigate and the trail leads them to a surprising conclusion!"
1,Should re-call this worthless book!,"As other reviewers have stated, the exercises in this book DO NOT WORK!!!You'll be ready to pull your hair out by the second chapter!I followed the direction over and over and over again, thinking I was doing something wrong. It wasn't me! The book is WRONG!This is a book teaching you how to learn a -ing programming language and it's like nobody actually read it after they wrote it! How is it possible that Macromedia and Peachpit let this book be published!??If this is what ""Training from the Source"" means, then I'll learn elsewhere.C'mon people! Test your product before you try to sell it to the public for 45 bucks!!!!"
2,Just Alright?,"Book appears rushed, incomplete, and at times translated from another language. Consider this sentence:""When the user clicks on the target movie clip, call the onPress() method of DraggableRectangle""Obviously, something, possibly an article -- ""it"" is missing from the second clause. To someone with intermediate familiarity with AS, this omission is easily negotiated but to a beginner, it could be a major hurdle.If you can tolerate and survive mistakes like the aforementioned, this book is actually a qualified ""not bad"" intermediate book. Unfortunately, there isn't sufficient sophistication or depth to really move your work to the next level. You'll learn a few things but this book will probably not remain on your shelf as an essential reference to AS once completed."
5,great book if you know some flash,"if you are a flash developer/designer who is comfortable with the basics of flash and actionscript, this book is awesome. confusing topics like listeners and the delegate class are covered well. i really liked this book and recommend it - i've recently recommended it to my brother because i think he understands arrays and for loops and xml, etc but would like to get a better handle on it, he's going to like this book as well.fyi i also had Jobe Makar's game book(green cover) and liked that as well."
5,Still the best intake,"The Weiand Stealth is still the best intake for the small block Ford. Yes I know everyone buys the Edelbrock Air Gap. But the numbers don't lie. And all magazine engine builds of high horsepower still use the Stealth. The Air Gap is pretty but the Stealth wins races. And with Amazon's pricing and free shipping, I saved more than $50!!!"
2,Not what I thought...,"I had ordered this manifold after researching it on Weiand's site as well as several others. First things first, the one I received had cracks in the water temp sending unit hole. It does NOT have a rear water crossover. So I have to admit that I got bit after I thought I had done the research. Looks like an Edelbrock Intake in my future.The good side of this is the ease of returns with Amazon, otherwise this would be one star."
4,Backhoe Loader Handbook,"Reinar Christian does a good job overall in dealing with subject material few authors have attempted. The book is for experienced backhoe operators, as the techniques described are advanced. The photo's are dark and lack detail in many cases, and some of the subject matter is glossed over. The author makes too many assumptions about the skill level, and overall understanding of his readers. Is the book worthwhile, absolutely. Does it need a new addition, also a resounding yes. The new additon should start with the basics, and continue with intermediate and advanced techniques, complete with clear, detailed photography. As for me, it is part of my permenant library."
3,Backhoe,"This book doesn't just assume too much knowledege by the reader, it's just not great technical writting. Way too terse. If you don't need a long concise explanation, why do you need this book at all? If nothing else I was willing to pay the money to learn how to dig up a tree root, but that's not covered. Would I buy this book again? Yes. It's the only one out there. I've got landscaping to do, but some of the road and site prep techniques were useful. A backhoe to me is a toy (with a purpose), not an occupation. To be fair the more I read it the clearer things get, I just like knowledge handed to me with less work."
5,Excellent Product,"I submitted a review for the accompanying product, which read: I am a native Finnish speaker, and my husband is not. We purchased both the book and the CD, which I would highly recommend. Even with me being a native Finnish speaker, it was really useful for my husband to be able to hear the dialogues in Finnish, spoken at a normal conversational rate. I would highly recommend both the book and the CD.The book and the CD are invaluable as a set. Also, the book has enough grammar to make sense but not so much as to be overwhelming."
1,Do not buy this book,"This is an extremely poor introductory work for attaining even a basic understanding of the Finnish language. The problem is that it assumes that the student is already fully proficient in the language. Instead of starting out slowly, the book launches into fast-paced conversations, with no repeats. The author should have broken the conversations down into small pieces, and provided slow pronunciations of each word.Professor Vahamaki's approach to language instruction reminds me of a piano instructor who is trying to teach a five-year-old child the rudiments of music. Instead of introducing the child slowly to the various notes, he simply sits the child down at the keyboard, points to the 88 keys, and tells the child to start playing Rimsky-Korsakov's ""Flight of the Bumblebee"" at full speed. This approach doesn't work for the piano, and it certainly doesn't work for a language as difficult to learn as Finnish."
2,Difficult to use,"This book is barely useful. It does not have essential charts telling you how to inflect nouns, or clear explanations of what the cases mean. Its focus is on strong-grade and weak-grade consonants, and theoretical conversations. This book was recommended by a teacher but I have found even stodgy old Finnish:An Essential Grammar much more useful and accessible. It's as if neither author has any explanatory competence in the English language."
4,Good basic introduction,"This is a very good introductory work in attaining proficiency in Finnish. Since Finnish is practically a minority language, there are very few course materials available in it and this is a valuable work. The one weakness I would say this text seems to have is that it doesn't seem very directed towards students in terms of the situations of the dialogues and the vocabulary worked on. A few chapters with more high frequency phrases and vocabulary useful for students laid out clearly (and voiced on the CDs) would be very useful."
3,Easy learning?,"This book has a lot of information in it about Finnish, but it is hard to use by yourself. It is very dense text and very few graphics. It is unlike any other foreign language book I have ever seen. It starts you off immediately with conversations in Finnish and you have to translate each one word by word in order to understand what they mean. I have also found that their guide to pronounciation guide is good for some sounds, but leaves something to be desired for others."
4,music to smile to,"This album really makes me happy. The covers of ""Riders on the Storm"" and ""Beat It"" are hilarious and ingenious. They are really very good musicians as well, with tight rhythms and smooth instrumentation. It will keep you dancing!"
5,I love it!!!,It's a great travel mug. I like everything about it. The makers even considered the shape to make it easy to get your hand inside to clean the bottom. Must have some women on the design team!
3,Just average,"I bought these because they were recommnded by America's Test Kitchen. Well, we drink a lot of coffee and travel in the car quite a bit and I have to say that I am disappointed with the heat retention of these travel mugs. The shape of the lip makes dribbles easy. I rarely use this travel mug as my old ones seem to do a better job. They come in pretty colors, though."
3,A Good Primer,"This book is fairly basic, and its layout of short chapters, lots of headings, photos, lists, and tables make it a quick and easy book for browsing. This is a good book for those with little experience, or confidence, in handling or attending meetings. It also serves as a quick refresher, because of its format. You will not find anything profound or innovative, and some of it is a little too simplistic or irrelevant. At times it seems a little exploitive in its approach to human relations; it is not long on how to overcome differences or conflicts. Still, I recommended it in the leadership development course which I teach."
5,The best tamale recipe,"The recipes for pork deshebrada and red pork tamales are worth the price of this book. If you enjoy Tex-Mex food, this is the real deal. I highly recommend it."
4,I love this cookbook,"I've tried many recipes out of this book and they've all been outstanding. The chili verde was excellent, the jalapeno poppers make those frozen things taste like dog doo. This is down home ""comfort food"" cooking at its best. Not only that, its well written, with mouth-watering descriptions of the foods, it inspires me to cook!"
5,Praise for the Kerrs' Recipes and Cooking Methods,"After about twenty-five years of looking for a reliable guide to reproducing the tastes I remembered growing up with in El Paso, I found Park and Norma Kerr's book. My search is over. His meat recipes (and his methods) for pork or chicken deshebrada are outstanding, and typical of the entire book. Tamale pie for company and pot beans for home alone! He combines the basically simple (and timeless) ingredients of Border cuisine to yield results which will delight anyone who longs for home cookin' as it was yesterday and remains today from the Franklin Mountains to Houston. Instructions are complete and clear, a pleasure to read and execute. Keep 'em coming, Kerrs."
5,Mexican food at it's finest.....,I have almost worn this book out and was actually coming to amazon to order a new one. This book is filled with wonderful recipes and general tips on how to make truly authentic and flavorful dishes. This cookbook will give you a lot of creative ideas and you will soon begin to experiment with many variations of some of their classic recipes. One of the best surprises of the book was Park's Texas Democrat Chili. This is a wonderful and richly flavored chili that is not too spicy. The nopalitos add a wonderful character to the dish. Try serving it on top of a little of their Mexican rice with some freshly grated Mexican cheese. Garnish it with a mixture of chopped green onions and cilantro. A wonderful combination!!
5,A must have for amateur photographers,"If you are like me and have switched to a digital camera and have some old negatives and prints that you would like to incorporate in your electronic presentations, this is a perfect scanner. The quality is comparable to my old print film and it brings to new life old pictures. Agree completely with the reviewers who recommend Photoshop or Elements to work with the scanner. The start-up guide could have been more informative, but I played with it a bit and no problem."
5,Pilates dvd,"If you are an owner of a pilates machine, you may want to make this item your own. It does cover some of the exercises that will probably come with your machine but there is a lot of different exercises that you will find to be helpful in working out on the pilates machine. And you will be able to do once you have viewed the dvd and you own the box that goes with the machine."
3,this is ok.,"too hard to start. I fell asleep while watching the introduction. Very soothing, not so good for my core. My machine still awaits my presence."
3,Not real satisfied,DVD runs quite fast . Its hard to keep up if I'm alone and don't have help changing springs .
1,Useless without the reformer,"For those of us who have never done pilates before and have no idea what a reformer is, this DVD is useless. Make sure you have the reformer (approx. $355-500) before you purchase this."
5,Great learning tool for contemporary instructors,As an instructor trained in a more contemporary method of pilates I wanted to learn some classical technique. The cues are wonderful but it moves VERY fast. Be prepared to hit pause a lot. If you are unfamiliar with pilates this is not a good starting point as it moves too quickly.
3,If you like tricky exercises...,"This is a fairly good DVD. It has several levels of workouts, although all are short. If you're looking for the more tricky reformer moves, they are here in the advanced section. Each section has a series that is done over a barrel, so if you don't have one (and I suspect most people w/ home equipment don't) that portion is not very useful. To be honest, I think I get a better reformer workout with the Stamina Pilates DVDs, but I like that this one offers some different moves that I can add into my regular workout."
3,Way too fast,I like the format but it is just way to fast to feel as though you have having any impact or getting anything out of this video. I have to pause just to concentrate. Maybe it will just take time to get used to. I like the GIAM videos much better.
3,Complex Pilates DVD,This is a very thorough pilates DVD. It is difficult to watch the video while doing the reformer exercises.
5,Great!,"Wonderful DVD! As a Pilates instructor, I have learned many new techniques and moves with this DVD. A bit too fast paced for someone who has never done Pilates. But, for the experienced Pilates student (I would say 1 year or more) give it a go!"
5,quick thorough routine,"I love this dvd. I'm not a Pilates expert, and I'm lazy, so the fact that the beginner routine is 7 minutes long (yes, 7 whole minutes!) and very thorough is fantastic. It doesn't suck up 45 minutes of my day, and the instruction is easy to follow.Basically, I come back from a run and pop this disc in and before I know it the workout is done. I've done the intermediate routine a few times, but I mostly stick with the beginner because it gives me the workout I need. I feel the difference in my posture immediately, and I can see the difference in my core within a week. And did I mention that it only takes 7 minutes?"
4,Nice Case!,"Overall this is a nice case. If you are looking for something with some additional storage, this is not the item for you. Your Nintendo DS will fit snuggly inside to protect it from scratches, but you won't find any spare space for games. Quality is good - and I actually had a friend who saw it and asked where I got it becasue they wanted one."
2,I'm not convinced.,"Film brings out many motives of the alleged 9/11 plotters, but really falls short as to providing proof they had the means to complete attacks on 9/11. Keep searching Mr. Friedman. I'm not convinced. Includes good interviews with the Arab/Muslim peoples and their different points of view about America and 9/11."
1,BUY FROM AMAZON! NOT FROM THEIR WEBSITE,"I bought this product off the television because I was excited that he was a gymnast. However, I received a free gym membership and never opened it. If you buy it off Amazon, you will not be hassled with the company charging you ridiculous costs for medicine that most of us can't take and charge you a $19.99 fee every month. I paid off my credit card and after it had not been used for three months, they called me to ask if my card had been stolen. It turned out that the company had actually charged so many charges to my card that my credit card felt it needed to file a claim. Therefore-- buy from Amazon--- BUT READ THE FINE PRINT! The very very very very fine print."
2,shattered dreams,"Believing that i need protection from the elements of winter and having explored this garment (albeit a cursory exploration) at Dick's Sporting Goods, i ordered this garment from Amazon.com.When this somewhat expensive purchase arrived, i tried it out. The sleeves are too long and it is difficult to put on and to take off. I would not order or buy it again."
3,churchill china wessex blue willow pattern,These were to be replacements in the event any of my original eight are broken. As in many cases of reproductions made in China the color was darker and pattern blured...but in a pinch they will do.
2,"Worked Great, for a little while (twice).",I bought this remote because it was the only one (besides the $45 original) that would control the dual picture function for my sony tv. It worked great for a couple of months then one day stopped working all together. Changed the batteries and still nothing. I was so pleased with it's functioning when it worked that I decided to purchase another one. This one again worked great at first and then would stop working. I could sometimes get it to work again by taking out the batteries and putting them back in or slapping it against my hand but it would eventually stop working again until it wouldn't work at all. I finally just spent the $45 for the original remote. I wish I would have done that in the first place.
1,You get what you pay for...,"Dynatron Miracle Remote MR110When the remote for our Sony LCD TV stopped working properly, I shopped for a replacement. I encountered this product at a bargain-basement price compared to the Sony replacement part, and purchased it through Amazon from Catch the Deal Inc. It took ten days to arrive, and worked for exactly three days. I then went to Remote Warehouse and bought a genuine Sony remote, which continues to work perfectly. Its not even worth sending the Dynatron product back. You get what you pay for.sjbrittPlmouth Meeting PA"
1,Worked for three days...,"Ordered this Dynatron MR110 from an Amazon Marketplace seller - took them five days to process the order, five more days in the mail...the remote worked OK for three days, then stopped functioning. Wasn't dropped, batteries fine etc.steve britt"
5,better than the original,We received the remote in 2 days from order. This remote takes 2 seconds to set up and use. the miracle remote's touch buttons are more sensitive/easier to use than the original Sony remote. Excellent value for 19.00.
5,Beautiful piece of artistry.,"This is mastery of artistry. I love this album for its intricate and mellow soundscapes it creates.Lovely music for relaxing, meditating, doing homework, ect. I personally feel it is on par with Sigur Ros and Explosions in the Sky. If you are curious, buy the entire album. I'm glad I did."
3,A surprise!,"In this cd single there are 3 remixes only but you can find the video of bootylicious also!!! the tracks are different from the USA CD single. The tracklist: album version(3:27), Ed case refix (4:45), M&J's Jelly Remix (3:40) and the video."
3,Great Dust Mask product with few minor issue,"I used to own this dust mask that I bought from Home Depot. After 3 years of usage, the stretchable string worn out. There is one complain that I have is the plastic cap to cover the filter keeps falling off every time when I doing work."
4,3M Half-Mask Respirator,"Does the job well. I used this when painting and I did not smell any of the paint vapors when it was on. Somewhat cheap construction to the plastic cover that holds the particulate filter, it comes off sometimes if the mask impacts another object. All in all, it does the job but you get the quality you pay for."
5,Perfect!,"I needed a respirator for my garage ""paint shop"" and this fit the bill, and my face, perfectly.It's not terribly uncomfortable, easy to breath in, and best of all really works!I wasn't sure that it was actually doing anything until I took it off after throwing down some paint. WHOA!In the past I had just sprayed stuff outside and hoped the ventilation was sufficient, when I decide to go HVLP and make a paint room that wasn't an option if I wanted a more professional looking finish.I was using Duplicolor acrylic paint which it seemed to filter without any issues. After a week of painting in the garage, my lungs are still intact and I wasn't blowing colored paint out of my nose. ;)Highly recommended!"
5,Amazing,"Since having this, I have used it for wood working, staining, sealing, painting, cleaning with mineral spirits, and spraying pesticides. I could not smell any of it. I've worn it for hours and forget it's on. This product works very well. I would definitely recommend it to a friend."
5,Excellent,The only problem was not knowing there were two filters in each side of the mask when received. The cap kept coming off and finally two filters became visible which was a pleasant surprise. After removing one filter from each side of the mask it continued to work without any problem. There was no notice of a copper fungicide spray. The mask could not have been better.
5,Works well,"I use this mask for spraying lacquer in my cabinet shop. With the charcoal filter in place, I do not smell the lacquer fumes at all."
3,Fair,"Heavy, the top head strap is a good advantage, the back neck strap isn't uncormfortable. Easy to adjust. The problem is the weight and the thickness of the rubber around the nose area: I could clearly see in the mirror that it was causing my skin to wrinkle and sag, and pulling my entire nose area down, which, if you are a model or trying to preserve your skin's youthful appearance, is absolutely not good. I could tell that after a week or more of use that this thing would cause very noticeable aging of the face. Unless you really need this for a job and are past the point of youth so to speak, do not wear this for a long period of time. I'll try a full face mask next to see if that solves anything. Again, unless you want to look like you've aged a few months or year in a few weeks, don't get this unless it's all you can afford and really need it."
4,3m respirator,"Fits face snugly, easy hook straps, light weight. Filters easy to remove and no obstruction of air flow through filters. Could'nt be happier."
4,Good respirator.,I really like this respirator because it is comfortable and fits well. I use it all the time but reason I did not give this a five star rating is because my filters come off on a regular basis. At first I thought maybe I did not have them on correctly but after looking at the instructions that did not appear to be the case and there really isn't a way to put them on wrong. They just don't fit as snug as I would like but I still think the respirator is a good respirator and very well priced. I would still recommend this product because it still filters out more dust particles and paint fume than the respirators I have used in the past.
5,"Great for spraying chemicals, with the right filters!","We use this to spray chemicals in our pine tree fields and it is fantastic. I feel a lot safer wearing this than just going out there holding my breathe! It fits comfortable, is light, and breathable. Don't waste your money on the super expensive ones! Buy this and some goggles, and get to work!"
2,so-so,We got this only because Lou Diamond Phillips was in it.It wasn't something we couldn't have done without.
4,foot tapping...,"Upon first listen of the song ""Rollerskates"" I knew this was a CD I had to have. The infectous surf rock single is unlike any song you will hear out of another Chicago band. I had very high expectations and while I was not let down, I was expecting more songs like the aforementioned. The rest of the disc, while good, plays a little more like The Starting Line or Self Against City than the doo wop, Beach Boys-esque single. The cessation of the album ""Top of my Lungs"" can also stick in your head quicker than most songs of the bands comtemporaries. Just knowing what they are capable of is reason enough to purchase this CD and be very optimistic of what future offerings may bring.Album standouts: ""Rollerskates"" & ""Top of my Lungs"""
1,Grimy Teeth,"I wasn't a real big fan of this product. I'm big on whitening my teeth, and I thought the powder mixture combined with the whiten teeth and get fresh breath all in one would end up being a favorite, but that wasn't the case. Actually using it wasn't so bad, but it made my teeth feel really grimy afterwards. I would actually brush my teeth to try to get rid of the feeling after I was done using it, because I couldn't stand what my teeth felt like. Not one I would recommend.I received this product in my monthly Birchbox."
2,supersmile Advanced Formula in between Mouthrinse - 60 ea,"I did not like the condition of this product that was sent to meIt was wet and badly damaged by the spills from the liquid mouthrinse.It smelt very bad and the box appeared very old and used, not new at all."
4,Not perfect but well worth owning,"I understand the gripes of other reviews, and as the Studio One series goes this one is not 100% satisfying. The interpretations of classic soul music by Studio One artists are fascinating, exciting and dance-inducing. Not every one is successful .... but none are unlistenable either. The high points are well worth the cost of the entire disk."
5,Really good,"It is a good book, if you want know about Java on PDA and smartphones then you need that, is so technical, so, you need really to know about Java.If you want develop an application for a mobile device, you need your computer, a coffe, JDK and this book."
2,Disappointed,"I just finished watching this video and I'm disappointed.I recieved the DVD quickly. It was packaged well and in good condition. But . . .This worked out to be about a dollar a minute, a very short video for the money. I was expecting more hand to hand moves that I could work on, and while there were a few, it could have been a great deal more. Honestly, I've learned more from YouTube for free.The production quality is lower than you would expect at this price, but the audio was passable. An example of the inexperienced production is the fact you can't scrub along the timeline, no advancing or reversing the video . . . you put it in and it plays. Then if you don't touch it, it loops.Overall, I give this a D+. Not a complete fail, but darn near.I'm trying to convince myself I'll watch this again and try to glean some moves, but I won't. I will seek a refund."
5,Great album,I received this cd a week ago and I have played it pretty much nonstop. These guys have done an amazing job on this EP. The music and vocals are simply amazing and the lyrics even better.I can't remember buying a cd I liked better.
2,Pool Hustler,"I was very excited when I noticed this game in the stores. I'm somewhat of a shark myself. The idea of the game is a great one, but the ease of playability is very difficult. I can normally pick up a game very quickly, but playing this one was almost impossible. I couldn't even get past the first level after playing all night. It was very discouraging. Therefore if you have a lot of time on your hands and don't mind losing for awhile then I would recommend it. If you're looking for something to just jump right into and have some fun then I'd say don't even bother."
1,DO NOT BUY IT !,"DO NOT PAY SUCH AN INSULTING AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR SUCH AN EASILY AVAILABLE BOOK.NEW COPIES OF THIS BOOK, PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN ORIENTAL SERIES, ARE AVAILABLE AT WWW.EISENBRAUNS.COM FOR $20 USD."
2,Just OK!,"I got it at a good price. So, I'm glad I got it at a good price. Shorts didn't meet my expactations."
4,good product,"Other than the laws stating cats must be on vehicals, this is a great product. Bolted on very nice and the sound is good. I used this with a gibson cat back dual exhast system. I would recemend this product to anyone."
3,Not as good as her historical fiction,"I loved Helen Hollicks other books (I Am The Chosen King, The Forever Queen, and the Pendragon series) and I found this book disappointing. Her historical fiction is detailed, well researched and very interesting. This book was romance meets witchcraft, and was very predictable.Helen, please write more great historical fiction!"
1,Unreadable!,"I was so so so looking forward to reading this book. The premise seemed highly captivating. And then I started reading...and I absolutely could not finish it! There are so many grammatical errors. It was so appalling that it was almost hilarious. How could this get printed?! Line after line there were misspelled words, comma omissions, fragments, run-ons, etc. I don't get it! Did anybody read this before printing it? Furthermore, the whole book looks like a mess. The cover art is nice, but there are inconsistencies in the layout of the text, weird spaces between paragraphs, and other highly distracting things. The story might have been okay but sadly, the execution of it was terrible. I love supporting smaller publication companies, but this work was atrocious and highly unprofessional. It definitely wasn't worth my $18.99.ISBN-10: 1905108141Publisher: BookForce UK Ltd (June 1, 2006)"
5,APOCALYPSE REVIEW,APOCALYPSE IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I'VE EVER PLAYED!IT'S ACTION PACKED WITH GREAT GHRAPHICS.ON A SCALE OF 1-10 I GIVE APOCALYPSE A 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Very Disturbing,"I wanted to read this book before the movie is release for more detail. Did the writer display deep detail? Yes!!!!!!!This book is extremely hard to read due to the emotional aspect, and somewhat hard to read due to the literacy level of this poor child (this is why i gave it a 4), which the Author chose to write the book this way for authenticity, but very difficult to read for me. That said; this is an excellent book with sad misfortune from A-Z. It is one that I just have to say ""Oh My God"". I do recommend, but this is not one for the faint hearted. Very disturbing to say the least."
5,Good Read,This book was very good. I was troubled by alot of what happened to Precious but I just could not put it down.
4,Precious,I wanted to read the book after watching what I thought was a poorly produced movie. The book didn't disappoint it did bring up a lot of negative feelings for me personally.
5,"Graphic, compelling, heartbreaking, inspiring.","This is a graphic, compelling, heartbreaking, yet ultimately inspiring look at one poor black girl with every disadvantage in the world blossoming with the help of education and a few positive adult influences in her life. A great book club book."
5,Great Book,"I bought this book several years ago for three bucks at my university bookstore. I did not expect it to be as good as it was but, it is now one of my favorite books. I am so excited to learn that it will be made into a movie (starring Paula Patton). I am buying it again because I loaned it to someone and they never returned it. If you haven't read it, please do so. You won't be disappointed."
4,A moving and eye opening book,"Push isn't the kind of book I would normaly pick up, Yet it was spoken very highly off so i gave it a go for, and loved it. I found teh book of a young women trying to turn her life around. With eveyrthing going on in her life it isnt easy to try to make it, yet even while she is getting ready to have another child, to make it a total of two. With all this going on her mother isnt of any help but you learn that she has the heart and the want to make it and she will. I would no suggest this book to young people or to the easily upset. The book opened up my eyes to a whole no world and the feeling that sometimes people just need a little support to make it. I recomend this book, even if with a bit of warning."
2,like a car accident,"Held my attention - too hideous to look away, much like a car crash, hence the two stars. ONLY two stars for being so extreme and unsubtle and that it is, as another reviewer said, completely unbelievable, and therefore fails in its pummel-you-about-the-head message."
2,toni,"Was poorly written and trashy. I know it was supposed to be in the hand of a illiterate child, but...... I will not go to see the movie. Would not recommend to purchase."
2,"Push, A Novel","This book is very explicit, graphic, and exceptionally uncomfortable to read. The author leaves nothing to the reader's imagination. It's all ""out there"". Now that there is a movie ""Precious"" that is based on this book, I know that I will not sit in a movie theater & be uncomfortable & embarrassed under the guise of it being creative & artistic work. It is pure trash in my estimation. No one under 21 should be permitted to buy this book. I truly believe the story could have been told without going into all the ""gory"", disgusting details. I do not recommend this book to anyone. The old adage, ""less is best"" definitely applies here."
3,PUSH,I baught this book on amazon for the price. I am in a book club and this is on the list of books for us to read this year. I look forward to it. Amazon has great prices on books. I've been coming back here more then EBAY.
2,The Most Depressing Book I Have Ever Read,"PUSH was on of the most depressing pieces of trash I have ever read. The character whose name happens to be Precious, was never redeemed. Although in life, things are not all happy and gay, this character had NOTHING good happen to her. The end of the tale made it even more depressing! Sapphire could have put at least one good thing in the novel. I would not recommend this book to my enemies."
2,more than necessary,"I'm not sure why I finished this book... maybe waiting for it to redeem itself. The story is the same ""teacher saves student"" story with way too descriptive incest. The latter does not add to the book, especially since it is not based on a true story. I did not feel that I am a better person for reading this book."
1,Push by Sapphire,This book in my opinion was not well written. I feel like she left a lot unsaid at the end. I think she could have done a lot more with it. The concept of the book was great but not a well written book. I would not recommend anyone buy and read this book. I hope the movie is far better than the book.
1,Worst book ever written,"By far the worst book I have ever muddled through. All of the note writing between ""Rain"" the teacher and Precious was not what I would expect inside a novel. Why didn't Rain look into the alleged incest and child abuse? Precious told her about it all in writing!It could also be the entitlement and lifetime of welfare these people consume with my tax dollars which made me hate the Mamma even more. Why don't we as a Nation do anything to help these people? When her first baby was born at 12. Why wasn't her pregnancy investigated? Makes me ill that we allow this and stand there and do nothing. Which, the result is yet even ANOTHER child we will support for their entire life.I guess the reason I hated this book so much is because of the content and I found myself hating the ignorant people surrounding Precious knowing that her life is the norm for so many ghetto dwellers.Disgusting discusting discusting people in this world."
1,PUSH = DEPRESSION AND DEPLORABLE IMAGERY,"My book club selected this novel for our June selection. At first, I was pleasantly suprised by the writing style and vernacular. That soon changed into remorse and disgust. This book has NO sunshine, just DARK, depressing, sad, disgusting and bizarre events that leave the reader disturbed. I literally had to read a magazine before I went to bed after reading this in an attempt to clear the jarring images out of my head. This is sadistic and I would not recommend it to my enemy."
1,Awful!!,wouldnt recommend to anyone...what was the purpose of this story...poorly told story that seems to over-emphasize the gory details of rape and abuse. Try Again.
1,Disgusting,I could not finish this book it was disgusting. I hope the movie was not as graphic and gross.
1,Trash,Nothing but trash. I wondered several times while reading if the title was referring to pushing the envelope and seeing how far one could go and get noticed and applauded. I read A LOT and give all material a chance but this was sickening.
3,disappointed,"I wasn't happy with the content of this book. I really looked forward to reading it, once I knew that they had made a movie based on it and had seen the movie trailer. I don't know how they made the movie from the content of the book. It just ends without a conclusion. Hard to read because of her uneducated lingo and speech, but I expected that. I'm still going to see the movie and the book was interesting but just too short."
5,It took me three weeks to read this book...,"Okay, I am normally a fairly fast reader, but this book took me forever to get through. It's only a little over 100 pages, but I could only handle reading it a couple of pages at a time because the subject matter in this book is so harsh and hard for me to stomach. The book is written exceptionally well. I really thought that the book was a biography and was shocked to learn that it was all fiction. And though the plot was very graphic, the book was not graphic just for the sake of being graphic.The author was not out to get a rise out of the reader like one would get from watching a slasher film or something. There is method to all the maddness that goes on in the book, which makes it an absolute piece of art. Yes, the book is horrible at times, but if you push yourself to get through the mess, just as Precious did, you will feel rewarded at the end."
5,Review of Push by Precious,"In the beginning I could not understand it but quickly became totally involved with the character and could not stop reading. It was so gripping I could not put it down and felt so emphatically for Precious it was unnerving and heartbreaking yet thrilling and grotesque. I would recommend this to any child abuse survivor and survivors of emotional abuse. Not a read for someone who lives in denial or has never discussed, read or has been exposed to literature of such abuse.I have nothing but respect for Precious."
4,I'm glad the author is telling the story.,"How sad. Sad to imagine there are children living in these conditions. The ignorance of parents that have no idea of the pain they are causing their children. Pain that they have obviously endured had to endear themselves. The parents were a complete waste. The mother made me so angry, I had to put the book down on more then one occasion. The father was an animal. Thank God for caring adults, such as the teacher, who encouraged Precious to break the cycle."
4,I think that Push was an alrighty book.,"I thought this book was straight. At first it was hard to read because it was written the way that she spoke. I thought it was sad and a real emotional story. It seems like a true story. I think there should be a part 2. I think that the law should have done more to Precious's mom, than just take away her checks. This book was not realistic, but it was good."
4,Heartbreaking.,"This was the most uncomfortable book I've ever read, but I loved it. I didn't want to continue, but at the same time I couldn't put it down. I'm in the education field and I think this should be required reading. I've recommended it to four very different people and they all feel the same way."
4,PUSH certainly keeps your attention,"Sapphire's PUSH is a story most people couldn't imagine or even believe, but it's dropped right in our laps to be read with shock and awe. While being a horrific tale of physical and sexual abuse, PUSH is also an optimistic success story of emotional rags to riches. I suggest this book to anybody old enough to understand it."
3,Push II?,"""Push"" had its ups and downs. Disturbing and motivating. It pretty much grabbed my attention. The estory reflected the dispair of a child who had to find her way out the hell of her existence. Did Precious see all at the age of sixteen? Did Abdul give Precious the strengths to overcome her miseries?Was Precious ending the pattern of abusive relationships in her family?""Push"" is unfinished. Precious is a character of power, she needed to be more explored."
4,Push,It brings you to a world and you don't want to leave. Sapphire doesn't sugar-coat anything which brings it so close to home for us. It's real and it's thought envoking.
4,Hard to stomach in some parts but worth the read,"Some parts of this book are kind of hard to stomach. Precious is given an chance to get her life headed in the right direction after ""slipping though the cracks"" of the education system. She takes this opportunity and runs with it and is finally able to move forward and set higher goals for herself. I wish Sapphire had written and epilogue so we know where Precious ends up in life. The language in the book contributes a lot to the story, an illiterate teenager is not going to speak perfect English, it paints a more vivid and realistic picture"
4,perverse and necessary realism,"A disturbing and wrenching voice that will offend the puritanical sensibilities of the superficially moral and provoke the consciences of others. An indictment of a society where individual potential is subjugated to the faint hope of a random intersection with a rare and constant earthly savior (in this case, Blue Rain). Those who prefer to remain in feel good fictions of the past should resurrect Eliza Doolittle or delude themselves with the mass market blockbuster airbrushed for the masses ""Freedom Writers."" Those who want to brave a glimpse of the dark limits of our humanity, sympathy, and willingness to care should risk PUSH."
3,It was ok,"This was a very graphic novel and at times a bit more than necessary. It was a good story overall, but maybe a bit less graphic details of the assaults on Precious."
2,Maybe it's me,"Maybe it's me but I did not enjoy this book. I think it is the upcoming movie hype that put the book in the spotlight. As I was reading ,I kept seeing the faces of the stars in the movie which I think is what kept me reading. I did not develop any feelings for the characters in this book."
3,A book with potential that ended up pretty disappointing,"This book chronicles the life of Precious, a teenager who is pregnant by her father for the second time, and her struggles to escape poverty and become educated.I didn't enjoy this book all that much. Maybe I just don't get it. I think it's a good premise but that maybe the execution was not all that swift. Well, it IS a first novel..."
2,Too short,"The issues in this book, molestation and rape are too serious to be written about in such a cavalier fashion. This book was insulting and, if the author could not place more depth to the book, she should not have chosen molestation as the topic of the book."
3,Average,"Precious Jones, an illiterate sixteen year old, has up until now been invisible to the father who rapes her and the mother who batters her and to the authorities who dismiss her as just one more of Harlem's casualties. But when Precious, pregnant with a second child by her father, meets a determined and radical teacher, we follow her on a journey of education and enlightenment as she learns not only how to write about her life, but how to make it truly her own for the first time."
2,Read To Sir With Love instead,"I so wanted to like this book, after hearing excerpts of the movie Precious on NPR. I was disappointed. The story line in itself is not particularly original. If you want a story of an inspiring teacher who appeals to low achieving kids, read To sir with love.The descriptions of the incestuous relations in my opinion were gratuitous and did not add much to the story other than to gross you out a bit. I'm not sure I feel any more aware or enlightened."
3,Took a little long to get here.,The book was in good condition but it took almost two weeks to get to my house.It was within the range the company said but usually my books from Amazon arrive within 5 days of ordering.
1,Push by Sapphire book,Horrible reading. Gave minimum substance and no answers to the many questions readers would've had.
1,Never arrived,"This was my first and last time ordering this from this company. I never recieved the book; however when I asked for a refund said I would be getting on. Have not recieved yet as of today. I felt like since I waited so lont they could have tried to give me a perk or something so that I would still get the book is a discount, overnight the book but none of that was even offered. I will not be ordering any thing from them again"
2,Buy it cheap or Borrow....,"Well, being as though the story is told by an illiterate woman who'd only began to read at around 17, the book is pretty poorly written, and at times it is downright unreadable (Inlis U r in pree skol.)It is a sub-par read, and although some would say it is inspiring, it's just an average tale of abused black youth. Maybe you enjoy hearing EXPLICIT accounts of a father raping his daughter, down to the point of how her body reacts to his movements. Sometime too gritty and foul to be considered artistic. It's definatly something you must check out at some point in your life... just check it out of a library...Borrow... NO BUY!"
2,not for me,I only read a few chapters of this book because the language was too graphic and very offensive. Not a book for me.
3,worth reading,"Although this book was eye-opening and certainly speaks volumes about a world from which the average reader is far removed, I found it difficult to read in that the author seems to have trouble staying in the voice of Claireece-- at one point she's got the protagonist butchering words that a second grader uses with ease, and then, a few paragraphs below, her vocaulary and sentence structure is full of parenthetical expressions and a much higher level vocabulary. It would have been one thing if the style of language, like Claireece herself, had matured throughout the story, but I felt like it kept bouncing back and forth. Very distracting, especially when the book is otherwise enjoyable."
4,The unfortunate truth,"Like many others, I was also uncomfortable throughout the book. However, I could not put it down. Why not? Well, because I know that these seemingly outrageous and obscene attacks on Precious Jones' body and mind are all too common. I could not stop reading because somehow I know that this is a story about a girl in my building or on my block. I could not stop reading beacause I know that had I been born to a different name, it could have been me.This book allowed me to confront an all too hidden world. This small insight for us is just another day for many. So, with that, I strongly reccomend this book. Read it, if for no other reason, read it to realize how fortunate you really are."
3,Reminder not to write off anyone as a lost cause.,"This book was incredibly difficult to read due to the graphic manner in which the subject matter was relayed. But this same graphic manner made the book that much more powerful of a read.Sapphire does a great job first having us identify the main character, Precious Jones, as other, someone separate from us, and then slowly pulling us in to get to know her. This technique allows us to recognize that someone in reality whom we identify as other can become someone we know and understand independent of our own personal situations.Note to readers: make sure to read the poem in the beginning before and after reading Push and see how your understanding of that poem changes."
4,Haunting,"Push is a haunting story of an inner city teenager, forced to endure sexual, psychological and physical abuse at the hands of her so called ""parents"" and her climb out of ignorance. She becomes a virtual slave to her overweight, slovenly mother and a sexual toy for her depraved step father. Precious attends school but is so far behind in her education, she literally becomes ""invisible"" as she sits in the classroom without moving from her seat all day. The author's use of slang and the crude spelling of words and sentence structure allowed me the change to identify with the level of intelligence Precious had. The book held my attention as I read page after page of her journey. It was really marvelous to see the progress Precious makes thru her journal writing she actually become ""visible"". Definately worth the read."
5,Push,"""Push"" was a book that was on our class reading list for Gender Women Studies class. The main character in this book is Claireece Precious Jones, she is a young teenager who was abuse by her parents. She's a struggling teenager with a child from her father he raped her. Precious went back to school where she met Ms. Raine a teacher that helped Precious through this difficult time in her life. Precious was illiterate, raped and later find out that she had AIDS. She also had two children. Ms. Raine began helping Precious they would write letter back in forth to each other. Ms. Raine helps other young women who are in need of help who are going through a difficult time in their lives. Precious faced a lot of struggles in her life but she was able to get through those struggles. Ms. Raine I think was the main person that helped and cared for Precious."
4,A GOOD READ,"THIS BOOK MAKES ME WONDER IF THIS IS A TRUE STORY!!!! I HATE TO THINK THAT THIS ACTUALLY HAPPEN TO A YOUNG GIRL OR ANYONE, BUT I ALSO DO KNOW THAT SICK PEOPLE IN THIS MANNER DO EXIST. THE AUTHOR REALLY DID A GOOD JOB WITH THIS BOOK BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU READ A GOOD BOOK YOU KNOW THAT IT IS NOT TRUE, BUT WITH THIS BOOK YOU MAY ASK YOURSELF WHERE IS POOR PRECIOUS NOW."
4,Push,"Very true to life,in the way the characters speak and pronounce words because of living in proverty with a poor education. It really opens your eyes to see the horrible family situations children live in today. It is sad because some children really live this life of abuse at home, which is suppose to be a safe haven from the outside world. Paints a vivid picture of our failing education system how children are moved along not knowing the basics of reading and writing. It also shows how there are caring people who really want to help and are geniunely happy to see them make progress."
4,Too short!!,"I think this was an excellent book, however I was pretty disappointed in how short the novel was, I read the book in 3 hours. I think more details could have been provided on more of the characters.Also I understand that the author was attempting to demonstrate how illiterate Precious was in the book, but I often got lost with the wording and phrases, and was almost like a jigsaw puzzle trying to interpret what the writer was saying. I have met some pretty undereducated people in my life, but I think the author's depiction on illiteracy was overly exaggerated."
5,Inspirational...,"This book reminded me how fortunate I am to have what I have...Precious is a perfect example of how true beauty comes from within, i cant wait to see the movie and pray that it does this book it's justice."
3,Embarassingly Derivative,"Push is a decent book, but Sapphire is a lazy author. She has nothing new to say- only imitates and exaggerates the works of ALice Walker, only she can't write nearly as well, and Alice has a much better idea of the world. Rather than reading this derivative trash, pick up any of Walker's books. You'll get the same enlightenment without the authorial tricks of excessive vulgarity and violence."
3,Mixed feelings on this one,"This was a horrifying if not over-done story of a girl that suffers severe and perverted sexual abuse. I don't mind reading about that type of situation however it did seem like there was not much of a story except for the shocking abuse-related incidents and after-effects. I did love the author's unique way of writing. It was heart-gripping to feel like you were in the character's shoes. You couldn't help but to adore Precious and want to cheer her on. So I would say 3 stars for content, 4 for emotional pull. I do not know if I would recommend this book but would like to see more from this author in the future to give her another try."
4,Disturbing and Discomforting,"Push is a disturbing and discomforting story which takes us out of our comfort zone. Precious Jones has never really had a childhood. Unfortunately she was abused at an early age by her overweight and trifling mother as well as her father. Sexual, Physical and Emotional abuse were all first hand experiences for Precious. The acts that her mother and father performed on her were beyond terrible. Why didn't anyone step in and take Precious from the horrific environment she lived in? After all, when Precious' child was born her grandmother stepped in to raise that child. Push's storyline is not a pretty picture; it's brutal, it's realistic and its raw. It's not a story for everyone but for those who like poignant and riveting reads written in a simple manner but filled with wonderful prose then Push by Sapphire is a must read."
3,My Opinion On Push,I thought the book was very sad.I never thought children could go through things like that especially at such a young age.It shows how the world really is and how people can be cruel.I thought it could have had a better ending and less vulgarity.It is a great book to read if you have went through the same thing or something similar.I recommend it to older teens and adults.It may be to harse for young teens to read and understand.I also thought it should have had a better title.I felt the ending should have let us know what happen to her and her chldren.Did things get better or did they get worse?I thought the book could have been better.I enjoyed reading it although it was sad and very cruel.
3,Push review,I found the book disappointing. I guess I fell for the hype of the movie which I didn't see. I was happy that the character was able to move on and make something of herself but the book was not my cup of tea.
5,You Never Know Someone's Story,"I would like to begin, as most people did, by saying how incredibly hard it was to read this book because of the subject matter. A friend of mine bought the movie, I had not seen it, so she gave it to me to watch it.I was shocked. She told me how much she wanted the book, so I got it for her birthday, she read it in one day and promptly handed it back to me to read. My heart was broken and then over joyed by this story. Yes it was incredibly hard to read at times (there is so much more in the book than the movie, as always, that is so much more brutal and saddening than you can imagine.) but I got through it with the reminder, you never know. Don't judge people by how they look, dress, think, etc., you have no idea what is going on in their lives. And Precious Jones has been to hell and back. A very telling story of how you can overcome just about anything. Read it and live the message."
3,Please read very intresting,Precious is a girl that is abused by her mother and raped by her father.At the age of seventeen she is living by herself and is raising two kids.Precious is kick out of school and goes to a G.E.D. school.Precious goes through all kinds of hardships through the book. I think the book is interesting becuse it can be challenging to read at some parts of the books.Also I can relate to the book that why I like it.This book is very intresting and a good story.
3,This was a tough book!!!,"I read ""PUSH"" with my book club ""VISIONS"". It was deep. I couldn't put the book down. It made me feel depressed most of the way through. It was just so negative and sad. I kept waiting and waiting for something positive to happen in the book and it never really did. The main character finally realized how to get a way from the bad things in her life and she started to learn, but she was still in for more tragedy. I think the author did an excellent job writing the book and the detail was wonderful. I was just looking for something really great to happen to the main character, I guess the book was just a little to REAL for me."
4,PUSH,Push was an awesome book. I really enjoyed reading on my spare time. The only problem was it was a little disturbing. Don't get me wrong it's a great book to read but the author describes sex a little too much. Percious was an inoccent teenager who just needed to express her feelings about her getting pregnant at 13 and 15. I don't like the mother because she's mean to Pericous when it's the father's fault that she is pregnant. I would reccomend this book because it teaches a lesson. A valuable lesson. I personally think teenage girls would like the book because they can relate to what Percious goes through.
3,"It was interesting , sad , and educating novel","This story is about one girl who at twelve years old became pregnant from the sexual abuse of her father. Throughout the novel she hates how her mother is treating her because she found out that she had slept with her husband , and the daughter ""Precious"" hates herself because of the abuse from her mother and father. Overall I think that this novel teaches girls who want to have babies to stop and think about the changes that will come into their lives after having those babies. Sometimes the language is too intense for some audience that don't like slang language."
3,Good book--disappointing ending,"It took me the total of about 24 hours to read this book and most of the time I struggled with both the grammar and brutal descriptions of Precious' life. This girl had a miserable life created by a monster of a mother and devil of a father. How she found the inner strength to NOT kill them both in their sleep was by the grace of God.The story itself was so troubling but I am SO disappointed with the ending. I kept wanting it to finish and not end the way it did. I'm sure the November 2009 movie won't do the book justice, but I imagine it will wrap some things up."
3,You Can't Forget It,Warning. This not a fun book. The heroine goes through all kinds of graphic hell. After reading Push I felt like taking a bath becuse you really do wade through the mud. Push is not a great book but it does have powerful emotional punch that has stayed on my mind long after I put it down.
2,Just didn't like it,"I am trying to be as objective as possible because I know so many people liked the book, but I just didn't like it at all. Like many other have said, if you take out the graphic details of the incest and foul language, you don't have much substance. I think the story line could have been developed much better. I don't agree with some reviewers who say the story isn't plausible. I know there are plenty of young girls like Precious in the world. I just think the story and her plight couldn't have been given more detail."
3,Umm Good but ehh......,"WELL..UM I READ THE BOOK IN TWO DAYS AND MY THOUGHT ABOUT IT IS GOOD BUT EHH. TO ME I FEEL THAT THE MOVIE WILL END UP BEING BETTER THEN THE BOOK. THE SPELLING OMG IS AWFUL. I KNOW THAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO SEEM AS IF PRECIOUS IS WRITING IT BUT DAMN!!! IT MAKES IT A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO READ WITH ALL OF THE ERRORS. OVERALL THE BOOK WAS GOOD, AND SAD. I DO RECOMMEND READING THE BOOK IF IT IS BORROWED FROM A FRIEND OR LIBRARY. DO BUY THE BOOK FOR OVER 5 BUCKS BECAUSE U MAY JUST BE DISAPPOINTED."
5,my review,"it was a very good transaction, the book was in good condition with no pages ripped or torn out."
2,I expected more.,"I saw this movie before I read the book. The books usually have more details than the movie which is why I bought the book. I know that Precious is learning to read and write, however, half of the book is filled with mispelled words and you have to try to figure out what she's trying to say. The book had nothing that the movie didn't. I couldn't even finish it. I got relly bored. Amazon also recommends the Darkest Child which is much better. It deserves 5 stars."
1,Worse than I ever imagined,"I decided to stop reading this book about 2/3's of the way through. After skimming through 5 illegible pages of scribble, I had to read again about the main character's yearning for her rapist father. This was probably the 4th time in the book that she talks about liking sex with her father and this was the most detailed description of it. It's gross and disgusting. It's not based on a true story, it's just a ""how far can I push this"" kind of book. Do I have sympathy for Precious just because she doesn't know any better? Nope. She's racist, homophobic, not smart (and that's putting it nicely), disgustingly crude, and she yearns for the affections of the rapist whom she hated (even after she gets some horrible news about him). There's nothing good to say about Precious or this book. Sorry."
1,Truly Dreadful,"This novel was so repetitous and bordered on pornographic. Alice Walker does it so much better. Fortunately, I picked this up at the library, so I only wasted my time."
1,disappointment,"THANK GOODNESS I KNEW WHAT THE BOOK WAS GOIN TO BE ABOUT...WELL I'M JUST GONNA SAY THIS TO ALL READERS JUST SEE THE MOVIE,DONT SPEND NO MONEY ON THIS BOOK PLEZ...JJ"
1,I never got this copy of the book and couldn't reach any one by phone,I did not get this copy of the book although I was charged for it I won't be using amazon anymore.Very Dissatisfied.
1,Never received my product,Hey I'm military and I am stationed in Okinawa and I never received my book. I deploying to Afghanistan for 7 months for Operation Enduring Freedom and I wanted to take the book with me so I can have something to pass the time with and the reviews on the book made it so interesting that I wanted to check it out but I never received the item. I have even waited an extra seven days to see if it was late but I never got it. So this is my reason for giving it one star.
3,Not what I was hoping for...,"I was really looking forward to reading it after seeing previews for the movie ""Precious"". After reading the book i don't even want to see it. It was gruesome and heartwrenching. but i felt like there was so much missing to the story. Like why didn't social services get involved the first time? why did they let it happen again? she goes from being pregnant with her first child to 4 years later shes having another baby. I had so many questions by the time i was done reading the book that just werent answered."
4,PUSH,BOUGHT THE BOOK FOR A GIFT. I HAD READ IT AND IT IS SAD IN SOME CHAPTERS AND INSPIRING THAT ONE CAN OVER COME SOME CIRCUMSTANCES AND WORK TO BETTER ONES LIFE.
3,Good book but....,I thought this was a good book but I felt the storyline was somehwat rushed and impacting. I have yet to see the movie and wanted to wait to review post movie screening but DVD/PPV is taking too long. I got a good read from it but I got sucked in by the hype of the movie and in this case the book doesn't seem like the better version. Let you see for yourself...none the less a good read.
3,"Troubling, but realistic!!","If there are some who think things like this don't occur in the real world, you are saddly mistaken!! Actually this story has a happy ending as opposed to most cases of incest and child molestation. A very powerful story with a very powerful cast. The only thing that disheartened me was the over abundance of stereotypes. Was it necessary to display fried chicken? The images seemed to oversimplify life in the ghetto. However, I'll take some stereotypes, as long as you can put it in the proper context. I hope people not in the know don't go away from this movie thinking negatively of poor african-americans. It is a good thing to see and experience people who don't look like you and be able to sympathize with them, and not look down on them.Check out my new book on Racism/stereotypes/polarization,etc.:[...]Plain Talk - Volume 1"
5,Oh My GAWD,"I read this book last month and I still can't get it out of my head. Can life be this cruel to one person? Unfortunately yes! There is no fairy tale ending and for that I am grateful. How many times have you read something and everything all of a suddenly starts to go right? Well you won't find that in this book. This book is so hurtful and mind boggling that it literally will leave you speechless. I usually hate books that leave you wondering what happened to this character or that character because this book does that to you but not because the story is incomplete but because you really want to know how this person is going to survive. Sapphire has done a wonderful job of writing this book, Thank You."
4,Triumph,This book was very interesting. It was about a girl named precious trying to push forward and make something of her life. She was raped by her father for over 16 yrs and had 2 of his kids. Her mother provided no support and accused her daughter of stealing her man. Despite all of these obstacles (she even contracts HIV) she still pushes on and continues to try to achieve her GED. The style of Sapphire is very notable. She uses street slang in portraying Precious and it proves to be very affective. This is definitey a book to read if you love to read about triumph.
5,One of the best!,"This book is a must read. It sadly is a fact of life for many teens no matter what race, income level or region you live in. I highly recommend this book, it will leave you speechless at first and then you will want to talk about it, more and more. I am still thinking about this book and I seldom do this. That tells you a lot about this Author as I read 2 to 3 books at one time, this book moved me. Precious moved me, she is still with me, I think she will always be with me."
4,Push,This was a great book. It was very inspiring how Precious handled all the cards that life had dealt her. She overcame some very devastating obstacles. I read this book in about an hour. The only thing I didn't like about the book is it was too short and the ending. I hope the ending is better in the movie.
4,Depressingly Optimistic,"A very vivid social commentary on the failure of the social welfare system and the Reagan administration. If you are too young to remember the early 80's, or were raised in the suburbs this would be a good novel to read to get a glimpse into the inner city life during that time. Be aware of extremely rough language and emotionaly upsetting plot twists."
4,"Good read, challenging at times.",This is a really hard book to swallow due to the nature of it and some of the language used. But it is really touching at the same time.
3,Be prepared for grittiness,"This book is moving and real. I did think some of the ""grittiness"" was a little over the top, especially the sexual descriptions. How many ways can she describe her mother's stinky box? Also I am a staunch feminist and know the reality of abuse, but I feel that the author's detailed portrayal of males as debased, unredeemable monsters does not do our human race a service in the end."
2,Push,"What a hard book to read especially if you have no knowledge of the slang used in the book, I understand the meaning which is horrible and sad yet uplifting as she grows into herself, but it just leaves you at the end wondering what happened."
3,A SAD BUT GOOD BOOK,THE BOOK PUSH IS A SAD BUT INTERESTING BOOK. Its about a girl by the name of precious who gets raped by her father since she was 3. Her mother is very jealous of her because she thinks that precious likes what her husband do to her and that she is trying to steal her man away. However precious thinks totally different from what her mother say because she doesnt like it at all. Anyway she never got the chance to learn how to read and she never learn how to write. As she grows up a teacher makes a big difference in her life and her life began to progress. Its a very interesting book. Im sure the readers will like it though it is very sad and shameful. Sapphire is a very good author and the way she wrote the book in precious language made a very big difference.
1,What A Bummer...,"I was excited to read it because everyone had told me it was so great. EXCEPT for the sales woman at Boarders, I should have put it back when she winced and told me it was ""a hard read"" and then suggested another book instead. But I wanted to see what all the hype was about. What a bummer!!! This book was a total let down. And not just because of the depressing events that take place in the book. All the book consists of is shocking sexual abuse that makes you want to vomit and barely readable text, because the author that it would be smarter to write it from Precious' illiterate interpretation. I read 1-2 books a week and this is one of the worst I've read in a long time. A much better book that is never boring & also a true story ""The Glass Castle"". I really don't know how ""Push"" got such great reviews. Take my advice & see the movie instead, at least there is some good acting."
3,Push is okay,"Push is a good book. I saw the movie first and then read the book. I expected more from the book and got what I think is less. My personal observation and opinion has always been that a book will add many missing facets of a story that a movie misses. Well, for once it was the other way around. The movie added a lot to the story as compared to the book. Emotional feelings in this very emotional and intense work was almost entirely missing. A lot more could have been done...the writing was too simplistic. Emotional writing is difficult, no easy matter, but when it's done well...we end up with a brilliant classic."
3,disturbing yes...,I first read this book years ago an it disturbed me then...but i knew things like this really did happen. I was heartbroken for Precious and wished she got her stuff together..
3,Push II?,"""Push"" had its ups and downs. Disturbing and motivating. It pretty much grabbed my attention. The estory reflected the dispair of a child who had to find her way out the hell of her existence.I was left with a few questions. Did Precious see all at the age of sixteen? Did Abdul give Precious the strengths to overcome her miseries? Was Precious ending the pattern of abusive relationships in her family?""Push"" is unfinished. Precious is a character of power, she needed to be more explored."
4,PUSH..,"Push is what I had to do to make myself finish this book. First off the author is writing as an illiterate teen, which made it hard for me to read..and took longer. The graphic descriptions of the abuse was a bit much for me..and I am not overly sensitive or prude. I think because child abuse is touchy for me, it just disgusted me. I thank God that I didn't go through what Precious did. All that said once you get away from the abuse..you begin to root for Precious and you find yourself Pushing for her. But in all honesty, after reading the book...I don't think I want to see the movie."
4,...A really good book,"""Push"" is a really good book to read. Although the story is shocking, sad, and horrific, it leaves you wanting the protagonist to come out on top. She faces so many obstacles, it's difficult to believe she will. The people that she meet on her journey to recovery have similiar stories and you hope the same for them. I've heard from others that have read this book that the main character is based on a true story and if it is so, God bless her. If you're looking for a quick, interesting read, this is it. I am looking forward to seeing the movie based on this book in Novmeber, 2009."
3,High Expectations,"Being a teacher, I was expecting this book to get more into the character development of Precious, as well as in the role of education/educators in the ""re-birth"" of Precious. It is my opinion that this was not done effectively enough, therefore, I had a hard time getting past the vulgarity of the text. I found it disconcerting; one minute I am taking strides with Precious as she puts her pencil to the paper and learns to write... the next, I am grimacing because she is lost in thought again. This cycle repeats. And although it provides a good glimpse into harsh realities, I wanted more. I wanted more of her relationship with her mother- what happend? I wanted to know more about Ms. Rain... more more more! The book is an easy read though, but I was disappointed in the underdevelopment of the relationships between the characters."
4,Good Read,Not exactly a very easy read (because of the dialogue) but good. The book is a really quick read. Now I would like to go see the movie!
5,Excellent Read,Excellent novel! Gut wrenching and heartbreaking yet masterful and beautiful in its very own way.
3,A must read for anyone who sees the movie,"My intention was to read this book before seeing the movie. As with any book turned movie, you see the characters in more depth and you start to understand them alot better. I found the movie to be really dark and heavy. The book was ten times that. Anyone who speaks English as a first language is going to have trouble reading it at first. Because it's written as she speaks - Illiterately. Just know that ""Maff"" class is ""Math"" class, ""ax"" , ""ask"" and so on..."
4,A good read,"This book definately took a different spin being told from the subjects point of view. At parts it was very disturbing and not always easy to follow. Because the story was being told by an undereducated teen, the timeline and story line were not as fluid as most stories you might read. One word I could use to describe this story is ""powerful""."
2,I guess it's well written...,"but I read to learn or for pleasure. This was an assault on my senses. The story is extremely sad and in some passages, I felt sick. I guess the author is a success in that regard; not an enjoyable read."
3,Very disappointed,"I kept hearing and reading about this book, so I finally decided to read it. I was sorely disappointed. It was riveting, and quite graphic, but the end seemed unfinished, the story very fragmented. I suppose maybe that's to be expected, being told from the POV of a teenager, Precious Jones. I thought that the illiteracy bit was a tad overdone--at many times it was a great distraction, though I realize that Precious had very weak language skills. All in all, I wouldn't highly recommend it, but it was a decent read. I've heard there's going to be a movie based on the book, but I'm not sure."
5,Yes,"Definitely caused out-loud crying by page 79, and then continued crying to the end. Intense and high-energy book, extremely poetic, with many moments of humor. Book is a strong advocate for helping silenced voices to come forward, to tell their story, and to find the poetry within themselves, and write. There were some moments where time moved faster or slower, and in that way was inconsistent, but I believe that was author's choice. Some parts seemed unbelievable or exaggerated in truth. Still loved it."
5,Masterpiece!,"I could not put it down.This book is a miraculous rendering of the multiple layers of abuse and neglect that lead to the disastrous reality of Precious' life. Intellectual, cultural and moral misery are here realistically presented as the result of widespread systemic malfunctions (school, health system), poverty and isolation (how the heck does a 12 year old girl give birth to her father's child and is sent back to her parents?)Sapphire's rendering of Precious' speech and mental blocks is masterful. Her insight into the effects of trauma (on the mind and body as well as psyche) is all the more disturbing that it is not thematized as such--just showed.Push should be required reading in all English classrooms."
3,Feels incomplete,"While the premise of the narrative is from that of an illiterate 16 year old, it was difficult to read. I enjoyed the story, it's a part of society shielded from so many yet affecting so many at the same time. The story didn't seem like it had an ending, it just ended, I hope the movie is better."
3,"Powerful story, mediocre book","The story is powerful, raw, graphic...and it gets lost in poor narrative. Very poor narrative."
5,AN AUDIOBOOK FOR REPEATED LISTENINGS,"I find it ironic that the audio version of PUSH begins (and closes) with a cheesey publisher's musical intro, supposedly hip and street-smart, which ends up contrasting successfully with the voice of Safire as the story of Clarice Precious Jones unfolds... with a BANG. I read PUSH first, when urged to sample some current fiction while working at a bookstore. I was enthralled, awakened, slapped in the face. Fresh, honest language, but not for shock value. The audio abridgement works. What was kept is the core, the essence, if you will, of the story. Safire's reading makes Precious so real, I've repeatedly listened to the tapes; imagining, feeling, thinking and laughing... A fluid story that touches on all the shades of a very real life. I recommend reading the novel first, and then listening to the audio, but, either way would work. RECOMMENDED!"
2,Unbelievable! Over Dose of Incest!,"I found this story Hard to Believe & Very Disturbing! These parents were Sick -BOTH molesting the child! Not saying incest don't exist- But this went to the EXTREME on Incest!... Some of the things in here were so crazy, that I had to reread the lines to make sure thats what it said....Bottom Line this story was a hard pill for me to swallow."
2,The story itself would be good . But there is just to much filty talk in it,"the book itself is good, and I know that things like this more than we choose to think about. But to have such filty language in it is hard to read beyond"
2,raw material,"When I heard about this book, I really thought, okay this might be good reading material. I must say if you can get through the first chapter you are doing good. I'm not much on the language and blunt words that are suppose to be written about a 12 year old girl. It may be a good book, but after the third chapter I had to put it away. I have a 13 year old and don't want this book around my house due to the explicit language in it."
2,Did someone actually publish this?,"I've heard of this book before, and was in the mood to check out something new. However, this book is written in a way that makes you strain to read it. Okay, I get the point. An uneducated black girl is the narrator. But after a page, I put it down and was just annoyed with it. Maybe it would've been better in third person. At least it would've been more considerate to us readers."
1,Dull Repetative Story; Whispy Weak Girl Character,"I have no idea how these ""depressing"" morbid stories can attract readers, mostly girls, and they somehow say they can relate to the character. I hated, and I mean HATED, the way it was written, it was full of all that negro language which made it hard to understand. Yes, I understand that may have been to emphasis this girl's way of speech and upbringing, but it was way overhauled.The whole story was just too much for me, you might as well go and buy ""Go Ask Alice"" or ""Crosses""."
4,Precious,"Awesome book, but can be difficult to read for younger teens. The slang takes some getting used to."
3,push,"Good book. I did not like the ending at all. I found it to be a huge letdown. I am not sure what else to coment on about this book, as anything that could be siad may precieved as racist."
3,It's OK,"This is one of the few times that I found the movie to be better than the book. The superbly witten script and acting in the movie, placed a big let-down on the book."
5,Fast Shipping,I ordered this book and expected to wait several weeks for its arrival. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived in 5 days and it was in excellent condition!!
4,Finally...,"This CD is for the fans of Cameo that KNOWS they were the tightest rythmn section on the scene in the late 70's.This CD is covers all bases. FUNK, BALLADS, GOSPEL... nothing is left unexplored and it is played to its funky MAX. The ballads are sung in the high tenor harmonies that made CAMEO an instant favorite. Wayne Cooper (R.I.P) and the crew threw it all in this CD.I was thrilled to finally be able to own this on CD. I have literally waited over 25 years to hear this recording without scratches, skips and/or pops.The true funksters will tell all their old school buddies that this CD is available... I'm reaching for the phone now!"
3,Ugly Ego,"I bought this from reading the recommendations of other Amazon Customers. For once, I must disagree with the plaudits heaped upon this disc. I find this effort merely, competent. Don't get me wrong, CAMEO is a GREAT group! But after listening to this disc, there's NO WAY I would recommend with such praise. My rating: Three stars..."
4,funk funk,"Cameo was still feeling its way in 78 when this one dropped. The funk is still PFunk/EWF horn based, heavy on syncopation and bottom. The ballads are sweet, especially Give Love a Chance and Friend to Me. The winner though is the title cut, after the last verse, Cameo just breaks it down and lets the rhythm section go off. Word Up would give the band the mainstream success it was looking for but UGLY EGO is classic Cameo."
2,Anna Rexia song,"I have not had the privilege of hearing the whole CD but my favourite song is the Anna Rexia song...however, I cannot make out all the words for it. Could somebody help me out with the lyrics??e-mail me at longhair82@yahoo.caBut it is quite interesting...and a genius title for the song."
5,Some of the best pop rock ever!,"I was very pleased to find this CD available on Amazon.com. The songs hold up very well. Clever tunes delivered with a fun punch. Amazing they didn't have any big hits, because there are quite a few candidates here. Great stuff!"
4,Quack,"WAhy did they stop making records? While this is their ""master's choice"" my favorite song ""Any port in a storm"" isn't on it"" Other than that it is a great, although somewhat campy (which only adds to the charm) album"
1,sucks,"This rock feature seems cool but it really sucks to clean... the algea builds up really fast. I bought the fogger to go in it and it works great the first week and then stops putting out a lot of fog, I tryed soaking it in viniger like it suggested but doesnt work ether. My other problem with the fogger is that is heats the water up pretty damn hot and just heats up my tank to much. very poor product."
1,THIS THING SUCKS,"I got the waterfall for my chinese water dragon. It worked great! for 1 week. the back was leaking water and it floaded my terrarium. my water dragon almost drowned i replaced the substrate which cost 30 bucks, then it happened again! so i replaced the substate again. another 30 dollars down the drain even when it did work, no water was in the collection bowl its to shallow. my dragon couldnt even get a drink of water. the store wouldnt evn let me return it. 50 dollars plus dirt, another 60 dollars down the drain this thing isnt worth 5 bucks it sucks"
1,Not Satisfied,"The product was not near the quality of what your paying for. It sets slanted even without substrate under it and it causes the water to run down the backside of the fixture, poor design and poor quality. Very Disappointed!!!"
1,Exo Terra Waterfall = Crap!,I wanted a waterfall for my two corn snakes. I looked online and kind of liked this one. I went out and bought it at PetSmart for $39.99. I couldn't wait till I got home so I set it up at work.Here is what I don't like about it.1. There are 3 pieces plus the pump. None of which fit together properly. The back piece is angled and falls off with any bump. And there are gaps everywhere.2. The pump has 4 suction cups for feet but the inside of the waterfall is textured so they don't stick.3. The Water collection area doesn't hold more that a tablespoon of water.Here is what I like about it.I bought it from PetSmart and I can return it.I will now try Zoo Meds waterfall which I think is all one piece. Hope it is better than this p.o.s.
4,chameleon's play ground,"so i got this at a petco, this is a great product, i ended up breaking the hose because i was a little to rough, i will recommended not using tap water, i will be buying the fogger. the only problem with this is chameleons poop in their water source....... so i have to clean it a lot."
4,A fine account of Fermat's work,"There is a tremendous mythology surrounding Fermat, and interest in Fermat is high because of Wiles' proof of ""Fermat's last theorem."" Fermat was undoubtedly a genius, but exactly what he did and didn't do will never be clear, because he wrote so little about his methods and his proofs. Mahoney's book comes as close as I think it's possible to come in figuring out what Fermat's mathematical interests and methods were, what he proved and what he didn't. Only high school math is required to read this book easily; the writing style is clear, and the structure of the book is well organized.Some readers may be disappointed to learn that Fermat's abilities were only human, and that he made a number of mistakes. But even a genius is entitled to be less than perfect, and the real Fermat is in many ways more interesting than the myth. I recommend this book to anyone curious about Fermat's mathematical abilities and achievements."
1,Cheap,"Not a great aviators kit bag. Seams and zippers were broken out of the bag. not as good as the issued ones from the military. Better off going to an army navy store and buying a used one, or buying this one knowing you will need to have it reinforced"
1,This isn't for sale anymore,"I went to the link for the ""BuyPlumbing"" website. The webpage says the faucet is on backorder. I called the company and they don't carry this anymore and said Amazon ""doesn't always disable"" links like this very quickly. So, the price looks great but it's bogus at this point."
4,good book,"my daughter (8 years old) loved it, she asked me to buy ""the friendship according to Humphrey"" after finishing this book."
5,A great read a loud for class discussion,This book is great for discussing problems that arise in your classroom and in students' home life. Every teacher has some of these characters in her/his class.
4,the hamster,humphrey is a good book. he learns about his class mates homes and the world around him.i would read the other books in this series
5,perfect for your 4th grader,"I've been searching for books to encourage my daughter to read. She's a big animal lover, so I thought that she would certainly be interested in a book with a hamster on the cover! BINGO!! Now she wants all of the Humphrey books . . . that's why I'm here - to order the rest of them! Humphrey is too precious to pass up. I highly recommend him!"
4,The Last Challenge,"I have seen this Western movie several times on the Encore Western Channel, and each time have enjoyed viewing it. Glenn Ford was his usual ""at ease""with a six-shooter and @ the ready,also calm,cool & collected,one of ""The Golden Years Of Hollywood Years"",GREAT actors. Chad & Angie were acceptable & absolutely enjoyed seeing 'ol Charlie(Wagon Train),play his usual good mannered,but dumb character!'ya still gotta love this character actor :-)Overall I would rate this movie a B+ and recommend it to fans of the Western genre..."
4,Really like Glenn Ford,"If you like westerns, you will like it. Kind of campy but then there are a lot of campy westerns. It's hard to find a western that my husband and I haven't seen. We liked it."
4,i liked it,"Personally, i liked it but then i am submissive in nature...there for i can relate to the way the main character was treated in this story. If you like the aspect of control, Dominance and submission, this may be a good book for you."
4,Classic Power Boats,Beautiful pictures of wooden Boats.from my childhood. Seeing them on the lakes where I grew up.I have never been in one but can dream.
4,D-12 Review,"I don't really like Eminem, but this is a must have CD for all rap/hip hop fans. It has really good rhythm and beat and has outstanding bass if you've got a good system in your vehicle this sounds very good. If you don't like Eminem, the rest of the members of D-12 help to make it so you don't just hear Eminem."
2,i cant say that i enjoyed any of the tracks on this cd.,most of the beats on this cd are dre style. dre's minimal production style was fresh in the late 80s when the bomb squad was king... but now his style is played out. mnm could hire any produciton crew in the world. there is no excuse for wack beats.most of the raps on this cd are ice cube/nwa style. with a slight mnm twist. and the mnm style is not up to the quality of his previous work.
4,Pretty good.......,"Man,, if you like offensive music, buy this CD. OR if you have the last 2 Eminem Albums. Best songs..........""ain't nuttin but music"", ""thats how"", ""girls"" (hidden) ""purple Pills"""
2,D12-lose,This Album is garbage only slim and proof are nice mc's but therest of the group is trash.hope the next album better
4,Eminem returns with the Dirty Dozen,"First of all, if you don't like Eminem, you won't like this. If you think he's offensive, you haven't heard anything yet. Backed by solid production from Em and Dre, this CD gives you more of what you wanted on The Marshall Mathers LP. There's even another disclaimer at the beginning in the form of ""Another Public Service Announcement"". Some of my favorite cuts are ""Fight Music"", ""Sh*t can happen"", ""Pimp like Me"", and ""Purple Pills"". The theme pretty much stays the same throughout, with the guys letting you know how they feel about different topics. All of the lyricists are pretty competent, with Bizarre standing out because of his voice. If you liked either of the previous Em releases, you'll want to pick this up."
4,Recommended For Suburban Brats,"It's a very good album, don't get me wrong, but this don't compare to their underground work. But if you're not familiar with the underground, then your expectations won't be as high.It has a good beat and of course Eminem is the main attraction!Buy it, for mainstream rap it's tight. I'm Out!"
5,Must Have Album of the Year,The lyrics are tight. The beats are bangin'. Any Eminem fan who has been craving more Eminem material needs to get this album. You can tell that D-12 had fun making this album and it is sure to ruffle some feathers. :)
5,Great,"If you thought Eminem was great you should hear the other D12 members. Bizarre is like Eminem Squared. Proof and Konartist Found Eminem and brought him to Dre they are about the same. Swift and Kuniva are two really talented rappers they rap fast with great beats, flows and hooks. You might just hear Kuniva do his Rondel Beene voice a few times.THIS ALBUM IS NOT FOR SENSITIVE EARS! IF YOU OR ANYONE IN YOUR FAMILY GETS OFFENDED EASYILY DO NOT BUY! THIS IS MORE INTENSE THAN ANY OF EMINEM's ALBUMS INCLUDING THE EMINEM SHOW."
4,Better than average.,"This album is underrated. Some people put this under the ""shock rap"" category, and then say that shock rap is old and has been taken to the limit. Well I dont consider the ""offensive"" lyrics to be shock rap, they are meant to be funny. The album itself has a light air to it, even the more serious songs. The made for TV Purple Pills is the worst song on here. I just dont like the sound of pop-rap. Its no deltron, but then again, what is?"
2,d12 1 song cd,I listin to the d12 cd about 4 times over my boys house and usully you can tell by first impression on a song if its good or not the only good song i heard was purple pills . But i got to give it up on that song because it is forreal tight but i still got love for slim .
5,Almost Perfect,"I saw a couple people say ""too much of D12"" in their reviews, well the point is this: It's a D12 cd.... Em is part of D12... I personally thought Em stole a lot of the attention from D12 in the albumn, while I think his parts in the songs are a bit better than the rest of his crew, they still got it goin on. All the songs are pretty much original as far as beats, and no this is not the new Eminem CD, he is working on his 3rd CD now. I think the best song is still Girls, his dis track on Limp Bizkit and Everlast.... All in all, I think it was a great album, my favorite song is Devils Night, and Aint nuttin but music is a close second. I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes Eminem, it was made out of fun and it is fun to listen to."
2,If 1 good MC out of 6 is good enough for you....,"Pretty weak album. Somehow listening to other MC's try to diss like Eminem, even ones from his own crew, just isn't fun. I don't know the names of the other members of D12, and I don't care to either, because they just aren't nearly as skilled as Eminem. A few tracks with very good beats isn't enough to rescue a mediocre album. Just not worth the money. And if you think this is the bomb, you probably think just about every other CD out there is the bomb too. For me, time to get off the Eminem merry-go-round, because now it just makes me sick. In my mind, Stan and the Real Slim Shady were the songs that made Eminem interesting and fun, but there's no Dido or satyrical, albeit controversial, fun. Just lots of stuff I've already heard from Eminem that I can listen to anytime I want to on his previous albums."
2,Nothing Like Eminem,"I personally have liked the past 2 Eminem CD's with great beats, lyrics, and choruses. On this D-12 album, lyrics mean nothing and there are absolutely no chorus'. If your a big fan of Eminem and black rap, this is for you. If you only like Eminem, don't buy this CD."
4,awesome,PURPLE HILLS IS THE BEST THIS CD IS ENHANCED AND IS BETTER THAN THE PLAIN DEVILS NIGHT GIVE IT TRY IT IS AWESOME
5,Most Excellento.,"First of I came to the world of Eminem When ""My Name Is"" Was Releasted into the charts , three years ago(cant rememember) and im still a big Eminem Fan.Now Onto This Album , Musicaly this album is excellent with the usual bass & drums in the background , this album has many atmosphericsongs which i could say are like ""stan"" and ""kim"" which is a good thing and it addes to the overall effect of this album(as a dark , ... influnced , violence , blood fest).Although This Is D12's Album I cant help feelings like this is Marshall Mathers 4th Solo Album As He totally rules over this album.Speaking Of People Who rule this album , Bizarre who i think his talent alone makes this album very good , as his humour fits stright in with the rymes he spits at the listener. As For The Other Memembers Of D12 i just dont think they stick out as well. The Best Songs in my opionion would have to be Words Are Weapons(CD 2)Fight Music , Devils Night."
5,D12's 1st And Best Album,"This Album Is Way Better Than D12 World. All The songs On This Album Are Awesome.If U Do Not Have This Album, I Highly Recommend You Go Pick It Up A.S.A.P."
5,"D12!kon artis,bizzaire,eminem,proof,swift,kuniva!!",the best cd ever!d12 is amazing!kon artis is my faviorite.just listn 2 american psycho and see what i meanbuy this hip hop fans
4,Good cd but not great,"A couple of the songs on this cd were horrible songs which is why I gave this cd 4 stars instead of 5. The 2 songs were after the song purple pills. Don't stop listening to this cd after track 18 ,as 19 is a bonus track which has a diss of fred durst and dj lethal. The track is called girls."
5,D12 Is The Best Group This Year!!,"This CD is really good... Each member of D12 came through with their lyrics and the producers of the album (Dre, Eminem, etc) give the CD a excellent feel throughout the tracks... If you are a real Eminem fan (not the one's (MTV Groupies) that like him only because he's popular) this is the CD for you. This CD will sell very well (multi-platinum) and will stay on billboard for a long time...So pick it up if you haven't yet!!"
1,The Worst Cd of the year,"D12'S Devil's Night is a bad cd in which eminem disses everbody from Tupac to ben affleck(oh please leave him out of this) to Christina Aguilera, this is stupid retribution junk about a rapper and his group, if you want a much better look at this subject listen to tupac shakur or anything else, Eminem and D12 is Just drop dead awful!"
2,zzzzz,"Its just another dull, well produced album in the creative cesspool that is hip-hop at the moment. Yeah there's some clever rhyming and some well crafted hooks, but in general it's just same ol, same ol'."
4,D-12 + EMINEM = GOOD MUSIC,"I would like to start out by sayin' if you are offended easily this album probably isn't for you, but if you take song number #6 into cosideration and just say to yourself that it AIN'T NUTTIN' BUT MUSIC. This C.D. Should also be found in the Comedy section (it has me rollin' throughout the whole CD). His first single Purple Hills is the start of many singles to follow. I think D-12 has a good thing going bringing Eminem on his First Album. GIRLS is going to be the next single I believe, it's the song where he rips Limp Bizkit and B-Real. The whole CD is good, play it all the way through, the skits are funny! I highly recommend this album if you haven't picked it up already your missing out!"
1,"Well, at least Eminem's loyal..........","I am very wary of crew albums; in the time honored hip hop tradition, superstars who have hit it big bring along their homeboys; from Nelly and the St.Lunatics, Fat Joe and The Terror Squad, Busta Rhymes and The Flipmode Squad and even 50 Cent and the G-Unit. Unfortunately, all those albums were mediocre, and D12's Devil's Night won't break the streak. This might be the worst hip hop album I've ever heard, and I don't say that lightly. The five guys that Eminem has brought along are pathetic; instead of trying to rival him lyrically, they only try to out shock each other, which gets old REALLY fast. The music is just not good; but of couse Eminem's white pop and rock audience will think this is the best album ever! Cheers!"
1,dissapointment once again,"Ever since Eminem signed on with Dr. Dre he seems to have lost his touch with his roots. Back when he used to break beats with ICP, TWIZTID, and ESHAM was his best days. Since then he has just became another commercial artists. This album will sell well but the respect of his fans will be short lived."
4,Can Devil's Night live up to it's hype?,"Any Fan of Eminem or D12 has heard Purple Pills and anxiously waited for the release od D12's debut album, Devil's Night. Don't get me wrong because it's a great cd all in all and any fan should buy it, but I had to give it 4 stars because some of the songs really don't make sense and are kinda stupid. Yes, I am a hardcore fan, but I'm just letting you know that you may be slighty disappointed. Overall, the cd is ill and everyone who is a fan of D12 should definetly buy it. Although, if you just want to hear Eminem, you'de be happier with his solo Lps'."
4,"Excellent music, Warped message","I am a long time listener of eminem and own all his old stuff. I downloaded all the new d-12 stuff before the album dropped but when i finally got it i was shocked. I was nowhere near offended by marshall mathers lp but devil's night takes it too far. The best tracks are 6,9,11,12 and 13. This Cd tended to stray from eminems old style but it was still excellent. I enjoy listening too it but some of the lyrics on there are ignorant and evil.i.e. devil's night(16). GO OUT AND BUY THE ALBUM. but definitely don't take it seriously. Dre's beats are also refreshing and as always quality but he only raps in one song which is dissapointing. Bizzare, the fat guy ruins many of the tracks. He has no talent and talks in disgusting half-rhymes. I recently heard d-12 freestyle on rap city and found all other members satifactory besides bizzare. Also buy M.O.P. and Xzibit if you like this one. P~O"
5,Fantastic Album,"If there were people protesting and complaining about The Mashall Mather's LP, there is gonna be the same stuff goin on with this one. If you are easily offended or can't take a joke, don't listen to this album.However, if you just want to listen to a fantastic album, this one is for you. Eminem is back and this time he brought some of his friends (the most notable would most likely be Bizarre, who's lyrics are intended to shock even those that weren't by Eminem's previous albums).Although I only listened to about 50% of the album so far, I would have to say that ""s*** happens"" and ""girls"" are the best i've heard so far. The song ""Girls"" (a hidden track) goes after Fred Durst and DJ Lethal of Limp Bizkit as well as Everlast. It made me laugh, but I don't know if they're laughin.All in all, this CD is worth the 15 or 20 bucks you'll have to pay for it."
3,"With the exception of Em's skill, this album is W-E-A-K","This disc is a mediocre effort by semi-talented rappers. The music is unoriginal, uninspired, uncreative, and the lyricism is bland. Hats off to the offensive in your face brashness, though, as well as to the fantastic talent expressed by Eminem..............This is a great disc to listen through one good time. It's bold and the skits are funny. The songs that stand out are: 6) ""Ain't Nuttin' But Music"" - very catchy, talented rhymes, in your face lyrics and nods to popular culture. 10) ""Purple Pills"" - hypnotic and droning beat. 18) A new spin on Pink Floyd's tune that, among other things, points out the truth behind events like Columbine...........In short, it's OK. Not original or progressive at all, but it has a few good songs, Eminem is fantastic as always, and the disc has a boldness you have to respect. Buy it just because someone is ultimately gonna tell you that entertainment like this is the sole cause for all societal ill."
5,Boring,This cd back in da day was pretty good but now its reall boring. my favorite song has always been pimp like me its a reall good cd but then after a while gets boring
2,I don't know about D12,"Ok first of all I have never heard of these Esham and Natar characters but it sounds like I should. Second of all if D12 is biting their material thats reel weak. That aside half of the cats most people think are tight have bit stuff from the finest. They know who they are. Anyways I do think that this D12 album is weak sauce. Eminem is tight and no body can deny that. His lyrics are tight his delivery is tight and hes with Dre, 50 and their all hip hop moguls wether you like it or not. D12 on the other hand seems like one of these side projects where a platinum rapper hooks up his boys even though they can't rap for food. The lyrics are weak the delivery is weak and sometimes the album makes absolutly no sense. The fact of the matter is this album would never had sold any copies had it not been backed by Em, that is the plain truth folks. Don't waste your money and listen to D12 on Eminems cd is you really want to."
2,PLAIN STUFF,"Eveyone's heard purple pills and likes it, yet don't make your decision whether to buy the album on that. I was a bit let down by the same mediocre styles, with the exception of purple pills. The rest sort of fades away and by the end you can't remember how the rythms for the songs go. The skit's are very frustrating and make you wont to stop listening. Unless you have heard more than just purple pills, I don't advise it."
2,D-12 bring hip-hop to its knees with its new album,"D-12 continues in the venues of Eminem with their bangin' beats, flowin' rhymes, and touchy subjects. While not as polished as Eminem's earlier work in The Slim Shady LP and The Marshal Mather's LP, The Devil's Night contains the same bumping bass and harsh lyrics that made Eminem so famous. The album suffers a bit without Dr. Dre's genius at the boards but manages to convey the same raw emotion as Eminem's first two records. While not a classic, it should easily tide those Slim Shady lovers over until Eminem releases his own new album later next year."
5,Impressive!,"This CD is just as well produced as the marshall mathers LP, awesome beats and awesome rhymes. It plays all the way through just like Em's last album."
4,very good,"very good cd. make sure you get this if you are an em fan. bizarre kinda ruins some songs, but i still think this cd is sweet.best songs : sh*t can happen, aint nuthin but music, that's how (the most underated song), purple pills, pimp like me (the opening verse is one of the best verses ive heard in a long time), girls, and of course revelation. make sure you buy this right away."
1,d12 sucks,"check out esham, pick up his Closed Casket album thats his bestalso get Kkkill The Fetus, and Dead Flowerzand all Natas albums are classics but there VERY BEST are Doubelievengod - That is probably there BEST its indescribableMultikillionaire - Just as good as doubelievengodWWW.Com - Their next bestleave this d12 bubble gum crap alone -- becoz they have bited natas' style so bad but instead d12 are sold out stuck up c%nts"
1,this is the worst rap music ive ever heard,"This the the worst music ive ever heard, Eminem has done it again made another bad cd but this time with this garbage a$$ group. Who probably didnt even write their own lyrics this aint real rap this is crap, if want to hear some real hip hop groups or real hip hop emcee go cop wu tang forever or gza genius liquid swordz cause this is a disgrace to the industry. And I cant belive these guys have the nerve to glorify the use of ecstasy with all of the deaths its causing in the youth. RAP IS GOING TO HELL"
5,Awesome CD,"D12 Devil's Night is an awesome CD. I didn't think it was as good as slim shady and marshall mathers LP but its right up there. And to that reviewer from Maine, he was wrong,Eminem did have D12 on the Marshall Mathers LP. This is probably one of the best rap CDs I have. I bought it for [money], at best buy, but it is worth more, so buy it today."
4,impressive first release on shady records,"eminem has done it again. although this time with assistance from 5 other talented emcee's, eminem truly stands out as the most talented in the group. the only rapper i think is not talented in d-12 is bizarre, because the comments he makes are so crazy they come off more as psychotic than funny. bizarre also has a lazy voice and is unable to ezecute his lyrics.every song on here is good from the first single ""purple pills"" to the limp-bizkit dissing ""girls."" my favorite is ""fight song"" which has spectacular guitar and great emceeing. all the beats are bangin with guitar, bass, and synthesizer mostly produced by slim shady himself, althought dre also adds to the production. the skits were also good especially the obie trice freestyle. anyways, a nice first release on shadys records and proves theres more talent in detroit than just slim shady."
2,I didn't care for this book,"This book is somewhat lacking for me. It didn't have anything specific about children photography. I do not really recommend this book if you have books on basic lighting, posing, or other specific area of photography because that's all this book covers. Keep your money and purchase some other book on photography children."
2,"Too old, not what I expected","I think the info in this book is rather old and it is not as informative as I thought/hoped it would be. There are a few good tips, but I wouldn't reccomend buying it...find a different book."
3,idiot,look this game is horriblee ....no objectives..u only see people do the tassk...whats the idea of the game.. i lost my dollars...u dont ua=se the controls other then prsssing the buttons to continue..whats the point...il continue writing mroe about the game..see ya later
2,Do not live up to my standard,"I have high hopes for this dictionary when I learned about this dictionary. I bought it because I wanted both Mandarin and Cantonese pronunciations. However, the book does not live up to my high standard. It has too few words to be useful to me. Even in the instance when the word do appear in the dictionary, sometimes I could not find what the phrase that I really wanted. Also, I found the pinyin (Mandarin translation) to be quite unconventional. Cantonese translation, however, is better than what I usually encounter in other books! Recommendation: Look for better dictionary elsewhere."
4,Decent. Had its place in cleaning,"While some people lived by this, I find it be a nice addition to my cleaning routine for my cymbals. It isn't a miracle worker, but it does a good job of cleaning if done right."
2,doesn't work except for making the clean parts a little better,"This cleaner really didn't make too much of a difference on my pearl crash or my meinls. I thought it was just the make of a particular cymbals, but on trying it on the pearl, multiple meinls, and various low quality no name cymbals there really wasnt any difference. The clean parts of the cymbal shone a little bit more after cleaning but the dirty bits I bought it for were almost completely unaffected. I'm disappointed but i guess there's a reason it was so cheap for so much cleaner. Oh well."
1,Waste of Money,"i bought this stuff awhile ago. when i used it, it kinda cleaned the cymbal. i went to dry it and i found all sorts of stuff that was not on the cymbal beforhand. i would not recomend anyone buying this. it just will make the cymbals worse"
4,Grove Juice,"The product seems to work fairly good. However, the spray bottle quit working on me so I had to pour the contents into another spray bottle of my own. And, their bottle was almost brand new."
4,Easy to use and happy with results.,"Needed something to clean my daughter's Ride Cymbal. Made my decision based on product reviews that others posted. Followed the instructions and very satisfied. Saved me $$$ by not having to purchase a new 16"" Ride Cymbal."
2,Not good...,"So I bought this thinking it would work well with all of these positive reviews, but it did not. I put them in the bathtub, sprayed them with the groove juice, and let it sit for a few minutes. I then washed them off with warm water and after I dried them off, there were specs of clean spots, and specs of tarnished spots, and it looked horrible. Do not buy."
4,Groove Juice,"It really depends on what kind of cymbals you are trying to use it for, but if it works it works really well. The spray allows the user to really spread it around really well. Tried it on a few different cymbals, and one it worked really well, and the others it worked ok, but not great. If you buy a new cymbal and begin using it right away to take fingerprints and smudges away right away, it will work well. But it doesn't really take off prolonged grime. For the price though its totally worth a try, especially if you are going to begin a cymbal's life with it."
5,Great,"This is a late review but the better for that. I must have been using this and four others like it, for back up work on my computers, for a year or more now. Very reliable and at the time of purchase excellent value for money."
5,Loved it so much that I bought it twice,"I originally bought this item to transfer files from work to home without the hassle of e-mail attachments and size limitations. It worked flawlessly and was so tiny that I could keep it with me all the time. It's also extremely adorable. Sadly, a few weeks after the purchase, my purse was stolen with the little guy inside, and I went without a flash drive for several months until I finally decided it was worth a second try, and here we are. It's just as good as I remember, and I'm so glad I bought another one. It's just a great teeny-tiny flash drive. If you're looking for a functional, non-hideous drive, this one is for you."
5,Very Good flash drive,"This flash drive was for my daugther, and she love it, works very good and she don't have any problem with it."
4,"So Tiny, So Cool, So Far So Good","This little guy is super tiny and works quite well. There is a little status LED next to the keychain hole that I don't think you can see in any of the product pictures - and in fact you can't really see it at all until it's on (perfect brightness, not obscene).Pros:* tiny!* cheap!* cool LEGO-like cap.* yellow = classy.* smooth, comfortable in pocket.Cons:* cap stays on w/ friction only - no tab or anything like that to keep it on. So far it still sticks on great, but I'm worried about it holding up for a long time.* keychain hole is so small there's no way I could get it on my key-ring.Worked flawlessly with my Powerbook."
5,This drive is a fun unique Keychain,"The jumpdrive works great! With it's unique design, friends will occasionally ask you what you're carrying on your key chain. I don't remember if it comes with a the ring thing that you use for attaching it to a keychain, but it easy and safe enough to attach one. It is really quite small and lightweight. The cap is sturdy and will not fall off, although it not fully attached to the device. I have owned this for about a year and I have been completely satisfied."
4,Wonderfully convenient USB Flash drive,"Great USB fash drive, very small i attached it to my key ring so I alway have it with me, amazing one GIG capacity.HOWEVER needs better and stronger connection for key ring. It currently provides a light weight cord with ring on the end. Not good enough."
2,lots of technical errors,"I purchased this book after reading mostly favorable reviews from this site. Also I've bought 5-6 Sybex books in the past and have always been happy.As a previous reviewer mentioned, there are allot of careless technical errors through the book. The chapters also are quite inconsistent. Some are well written and easy to follow, however some important chapters, mostly in the second half (70-296) are completely lacking and feel like they were written by people with little experience with the product.It seems like this book was rushed out without being properly edited. I'll need to buy another book to fill in the gaps before taking the exam. I'll be thinking twice before purchasing my next Sybex book."
3,Not up to snuff with rest of the stuff from Sybex,"Average book on the subject but defintely not the best. Failed to properly cover parts of the exam in enough detail to prepare for the exam. Other sections were covered in too much detail and were unnecessary in prep for exam. I suppelmented my study with hands-on knowledge from work and from white papers from Microsoft itself. If you do not have hands-on knowledge with W2K3, then be prepared to get smacked down if you only used this book as your prep."
1,Way off Target,"I'm just adding my two cents to what's already been said. I'm an MCSE, MCDBA and an MCT. I'm also an actual consultant who works with the products, not just training. Anywho, enough of that.My absolute #1 issue with the book is that it isn't in line with the exam itself. The chapters that are aligned (in theory) with the 292 exam basically miss a lot of information that is covered in the exam itself. There is no real paralleling the exam.That included (boy, did it ever) the sample tests. There was almost no relation between the materials handled in the real exam question and the samples. I'm absolutely not looking for braindump here, but I do want to play at least in the same forest!"
2,"Not detailed enough, few annoying mistakes in text","The book supposedly covers both exams, but ends up doing a rather half hearted job instead. Once you start doing practice exams and finally the exams themselves, you will find this book sorely lacking in detail. For the amount of fairly obscure questions that came up in the exam about SUS and Terminal Services the book's detail is woefully inadequate.I've used several Sybex books in the past and found them to be usually very good, but this one is next to useless really. Do not buy this on it's own and expect to pass."
1,Incomplete and with many mistakes,"Having just re-taken and passed 70-292 I can only say this book is a waste of time. It is incomplete, sometimes wildly inaccurate and especially the test questions do not reflect the exam at all and have many mistakes in them. I used to use Sybex books for my previous MCSA certification, but in this case the Microsoft self-paced training kit is actually much better and more complete. I used that one the second time and passed without problems. If you want some additional info next to the Microsoft book (always a good idea) visit the MS website or try the Syngress 70-292 studyguide next to it."
1,I'd rather be doused with battery acid,"Just took 70-292, and passed but no thanks to Sybex's book. Glaring omissions, thin material and some outrageous technical errors make this book a $40 doorstop. The sheer amount of patently false information (one test question on the CD actually said that you should apply a Group Policy to a security group!) makes on wonder if the authors and editors at Sybex were gassed up on nitrous when this went through. The amount of material that in the book that actually appeared on the exam was minimal, and some exam subjects weren't even mentioned in the MCSA section of the book! I felt that I had wasted my time and money by using this book. For those Win2k MCSEs out there looking to upgrade, get the book from MS Press instead. Don't make the same mistake I did."
2,To Basic for Exams,This book provide a high level overview of Windows 20003. It does not provide enough detail to pass the exams.
3,* You get what you pay for *,"Purchased for my Brother DCP-1200 printer. Claims to give $6000 pages per refill but already getting ""Toner Empty"" after printing 500 pages. The print quality however, is the same as the original."
3,Disappointing,"This is an early Ludlum that I had not read. I was so looking forward to it, but I really could not get into it. And I love Robert Ludlum. Maybe I should try again."
5,"Disposable plastic gradutated medicine cups, 1oz","Disposable plastic gradutated medicine cups, 1ozVery good product. Well-packed. Shipped promptly."
5,An excellent survey,"This CD provides a broad introduction to early organ music, including material by Antonio de Cabezon and his contemporaries. Since the best organ compositions prior to the baroque era were written in Spain and Portugal, the CD provides a broad window into the world of Renaissance keyboard music.Parkins provides a careful, competent treatment of the material. I am not enough of a scholar of music to comment upon the authenticity of the performance, but it is musical and a joy to hear. The ambiance of the chapel adds some sweetness and depth to the recording. The sound is clean and free of artifacts.The overall quality of the CD is high despite being on the value-priced Naxos label. The recently constructed organ at Duke University, and the university's organist, may not have the cachet of the fancy period instruments and European players. The music, however, is just as powerful."
5,Great Idea Dewalt,I got me several pair of the bi focal safety glasses and love them. I also got a pair of these glasses for a FINE looking co worker. She really likes them also.
4,very good and promising book,This is a very good biblical book about where those who have been born again will spend eternity. If you have not yet been born again you will probably have difficulty in understanding the book. But hopefully you will become born again. As a born again christian this is a great sneak preview of our final destination
3,I expected more,"I was disappointed to find that this book is essentially a museum catalog of a specific exhibition. While it is extremely well done as such, the collection of objects it represents is necessarily limited.I make and design furniture, and was hoping to find more represented. The rather limited selection of objects shown are by Aalto and other very familiar designers. Practically nothing is shown from the new generation of Finns.As an overview of 20th Century Finnish work, this book is ok. It is not particularly exciting and could be better organized, but unfortunately is one of the few works in English on the subject."
3,Don't Confuse This New Book With CWC3,"Readers are cautioned that this new book is not a 4th edition of the Chronic Wound Care series edited by Krasner, Rodeheaver and Sibbald (2001, HMP Communications). Mosby and the three editors of this new text have done a disservice to the wound care community by creating such confusion. It's too bad that the editors could not come up with a more original title for such a useful new reference tool."
2,"A pretty low excitement game. Keeps you playing, though","Disney's Tarzan is all right. Once you get the hang of the controls it's really not that hard. At one point, it became very frustrating because you get codes to start at a certain level every four levels or so, and the hardest level for me was at the last level befor another code, so I kept dying and having to go back and replay the levels I had already beat many times. In general, though, I guess this game hooks you as much as any video game. The final boss was really easy- it was kind of anticlimactic. Also: all the levels are pretty much the same, so it kind of get tedious. This game is definatly geared toward younger kids; they's probably have a better time with it than I did."
3,Can be finished in 1 day,"This game is way to easy as i finished it in 1 day. The gameplay isn't that good where all you do is search for bananas, you can't even attack in any way you just have to jump aruond and dodge things. Some good bits but other than that this game is for kids under 12."
5,My Kids Love It,"My children (11 & 7) just bought this game and they haven't put it down. They love it. It has been challenging for them, but not too hard. I would recommend it."
2,"OK, but a little difficult with too few passwords","I rented this game and I'm only on level 2, but I've found that the scenery doesn't change much and I have to keep repeating level 1 because I haven't gotten a password yet, although the game does have some passwords, which I just now got off the internet. I'm glad that I rented this game before buying it-I don't want to waste the money."
5,Review From Books That Heal kids,"I agree with absolutely every single 5 star review on amazon. As a school counselor, sometimes I feel like we don't talk enough about differences and diversity to children. If someone is being picked on, I love bringing up Eggbert. It is a very memorable book. The author does a good job of not making the issue of differences not too complicated for young children to understand. Eggbert also makes me think of the word Rejected. Lots of kids feel rejected for so many reasons. I want kids to include and embrace everyone, that's why this book is on my shelf. So thankful I found it!"
5,Arcane chicanery and witchy revenge!,"Although originally published as three monthly comic books, this collection shows brilliantly the wonderful versatility of the graphic novel form. Author Robinson manages to combine just the most apt amounts of lyric eroticism and spine-jingling horror in the intriguing tale of witchery and revenge across the centuries. The art matches well, from several artists in varying degrees of baroque-ness. This is a great deal of fun and a genuine reading and perusing pleasure. A vital addition to any collection of graphic novels, if a tad on the mature side."
3,Not as good as originally thought...,"I know this is a small book and that this could not possibly write about all the haunted hot spots in Arizona. I get that. However, I am a rare native of Arizona and have heard many stories thru my lifetime. I have a chance to be in some of the places. The main concern here is that even tho this does list places, this book does not seem to cover the most haunted spots. It appears more to just randomly pick spots in cities.Now, with that being said, this book is well written with good knowledge of the areas that are covered."
3,WeedFlower Student Review,"We don't agree that Weedflower deserve four and a half stars. We all agree giving Weedflower 3 stars. We recommend this book to people who want know what happen to the Japanese during World War 2. We didn't like the beginning of the book because it started with 1, 2, and 3. This book grabs our attention because it gave a lot of information but we won't gibe it 5 starts because we did it like the ending we did it know what happen to Frank or Sumiko but we till like the book."
4,my book report on weedflower,"The Weedflower is a great realistic fiction book about a Japaness girl named Sumiko raised on a farm in California. That is the only Japaness girl in her class and that is always being teased. Espiesally after the pearl horbor insident, she was being thought of as a spy like the restof the Japaness people in america by most americans. Also as the suspicion grows about spies, Sumikos family finds that thier being moved to an internment camp in one of the most hottest deserts in the usa.The old life they had is now just a memory.Then she discovers that the camp is on an indian reservation,and that the Japaness are just as unwanted thier as they were at thier old home.That is when she meets a young boy from the Mohave tribe.Could this be her real first friend. Even if he is angry that the camp she is living on is his tribes land."
4,Internment,"I really liked Weedflower, as it as very descriptive about lfe for Japanese-Americans bfore and after Pearl Harbor. It would be nice if Cynthia Kaohata wrote a sequel, too.-Emma D. (for a school project)"
4,Vigilante 8,"All around great game. Gameplay is solid. Storyline is pretty cool. Multiplayer is realy good. I think if you own a playstation system you should have this game. If I one game stuck in PS1 forever and I could never change discs, it would be this game."
3,"Well played, not a classic","The recording is clear and spacious, with the clarinet well placed in the overall aural pictures. Ottensamer plays impressively well whilst not conveying the full emotional impact of Spohr's work. The pieces themselves are well constructed with mellow adagios and lively conclusions. Wildner directs the Slovakian orchestras with purpose and the players respond to this. Not sure why, but it still does not move me overly. Perhaps they are not great concerto works."
2,Good material played badly,"The works by Louis Spohr featured on this recording are not standard works for clarinet, which is very refreshing. One can only hear the Mozart Concerto so many times before wondering if anyone else composed anything of note. These works are quite interesting and fun to hear as well as to play. However, the performance is mediocre at best. When listening to the recording, one begins to wonder where one measure ends and the next begins. Even with a score, it is difficult to find any semblance of a steady beat. The expressive quality of the playing is also somewhat lacking, partially because the technical aspects (including tempo) are quite weak. While this recording offers the opportunity to become aquainted with different material for the clarinet, it does not provide a good representation of the true musical quality of the pieces."
3,Comfortable and Nice,"This recording of L. Spohr's clarinet concertos is very well apt and competent, to be sure, but the fundamental shortcoming is that the works by Spohr are not particularly impressive themselves. Ottensamer, the clarinetist, is technically very beautiful and an all-around wonderful clarinetist with an enviable talent. If you want some relaxing background music for rading, or writing, this is pretty well, but for deep passionate music, keep at it."
2,Had to send it back!,"The antenna was well made, and came with a number of adaptors to fit multiple vehicles. I was using it on a toyota. The adaptor work well, however I had read other reviews that said that it loosened during driving. The antenna is heavy, and the signal was great from it. I went on a 200 mile trip, and when I checked it that evening, Yes, it had partially unscrewed, and had to be tightened down. I did not want to use lock tight because it should have been able to stay tightened on its own.Bottom line, I became more concerned that it would not tighten properly, and returned it. Beware because it is stainless steel, heavy, and will damage the vehicle if it fall off during travel."
3,paper jams,"Good print quality when the paper actually feeds, it constantly has paper jams, I have to watch over it and refeed the paper, I think its because it only feeds from the right side and it gets pulled in at an angle. I have two of these and the problem is with both of them. Not a good design, probably why its no longer available."
5,I'm impressed,"I bought the i860 to replace an aging (and jamming) Canon 6000. As a professional editor, I needed a printer that would easily print out occasional long manuscripts (including colored edits) without the need for constant babysitting--in other words, fewer jams. As the owner of a new digital camera, I wanted a printer that would produce decent photos. And I had really appreciated the separate ink tanks in my old Canon printer. After reading the reviews, I decided this one for me, and I have been delighted. My manuscripts print out quickly and smoothly--and duplexing them is very easy. My photos are beautiful, rivaling photo-shop printouts. The printer is quiet and hardly ever jams (so far), and the ink seems to go a long way. My only regret is I had stocked up on ink tanks for the Canon 6000 right before it gave up the ghost, and this one uses different color tanks. No matter. The change is still worth it."
5,It WOWED me!,"Although this was not the latest or most expensive of the Canon consumer printers, I chose it because it had separate ink tanks for each color and an extra large black ink tank for printing text. Every time it prints, it gives me an update on how much ink I have left in each of the tanks. It was a snap to set up, very, very quiet (compared to my Epson), fast, and the output is just gorgeous. Not only does it print well, it's intuitive and friendly, like the Mac I use it on, so it's a perfect fit!"
5,Excellent printer for the price,Excellent printer. Very fast compared to our old Epson Stylus 440. Makes efficient use of ink. The photos we have printed on the Photo Paper Pro paper are as good as if they came from a 1 hour development center.
2,yabber,It took over two weeks to be delivered. I probably paid to much for the used printer. It came with No ink cartriges. Not satisfied.
5,Nice printer for the price,"I've owned this printer for several years and have been very happy with it. It prints quickly and does a good job. I do not use it to print photos all that much but when I have it does a very good job. The photos are crisp and clear. It does have 5 ink tanks on it that run between $11-$13 a piece. Luckily, they do not all go out at the same time! But compared to the print quality of previous printers I've owned and the cost of ink cartridges for those (like a Lexmark that's ink cost almost as much as the printer itself!) this printer does an excellent job. You shouldn't be disappointed."
1,Don't like it,"This printer makes me passive aggressive. I've owned it for 3 years and never liked it. Two major problems. First, when printing the first sheet after turning it on, mine sits for a whole 83 seconds and does nothing but spin, make noise, rotate, slide back and forth, etc. It's ANNOYING.Second, the black ink is problematic... it EVAPORATES really fast. If I don't print for a couple weeks, half the ink disappears. I've never seen that before in other printers. It makes the ink very expensive when I only can use half a bottle."
5,WOW!!!,"This has to be the best printer I have had. The quality is dark room quality. I can't believe how good this printer is.Highly reccommend, can't go wrong."
1,Canon Won't Stand Up for Its Defective Products,"Product failed after 4 months of very light use. Canon was initially responsive and sent a replacement print head, but that failed to resolve the problem. Canon refused to replace or give a refund. Was convinced by top Consumer Reports ratings that Canon was top notch manufacturer. Don't be fooled. Buy an HP."
1,no USB cable,"I just received my new i860, unpacked it to set it up and what to my surprise - no USB cable! So here I am with absolutely no way of using the thing.I find it hard to believe that Canon would ship a printer that one cannot connect to their PC without going back to the store and buying a cable. I've heard of cheap products before but this takes the cake.So I can't really rate this item because I can't connect it!"
2,1 1/2 Year and the honeymoons over,"I'll be fair. This printer printed out some of the best photos of my life--pictures when I first was dating my boyfriend, family photos, when my boyfriend proposed to me, our first big trip together, and yes, even my cute little doggie. But the honeymoon is over. The printer broke down after a year and a half of use. The cause? You got me. I would've thought it would have lasted at least 2 years--but nope. Even my old HP is still running. The upside...I upgraded to the IP6000D. :)"
4,A new one from D.C.'s sledgehammer trio,"Another (in addition to ""Got Live if You Want it"") top-notch release from the the D.C. stoner rock/70's metal/space-punk group . . . Like Neil Young stuck in perpetual ""My My, Hey Hey (Into the Black)"" mode, these guys walk around with the Hammer of the Gods hanging from their pockets, hitting you with skronky, feedback-laden guitar that flattens you like a semi hitting a squirrel. So what if you can't understand all the lyrics? To a great degree, that's sorta the point: this is mood music for folks in a not-so-great mood. The words mean very little when the aural assault is as powerful as this. Picture your favorite Led Zep instrumental passages, done up by a trio of pissed-off, melancholy kids with a strong Neil Young/howlin' wolf (the animal, not the blues great) fetish. Worth every penny.If you're interested in the ""Got Live . . ."" review, check it out here at Amazon. Still working my way back to the early stuff . . ."
5,good sludge,"This band rocks so much you almost forget that you are listening to music that makes Black Sabbath's tempos seem like speed metal. I could swear the singer Jason Simon is really Jim Reid from J&M Chain, their voices are so similar."
4,Great Book - Durability Is An Issue,"I loved this book and so did my kids. However, they loved it so much that the pages are now falling out. This isn't because they've abused it, but because of the wire spiral-type binding and thin pages that the book is made of. Although this feature allows for more pages and ease of turning, one wrong turn of accidental hard turn and RIIIIPPP, there goes half the page on food. However, that's what they made tape for - right?Great great book and I highly recommend it. However, be forewarned that you'll have to tape things here and there because of the book design, but some of that is just life with growing children."
1,Immoral,"Based on what I know about this book, I believe it to be immoral. The book wants you to convert your spouse. I find converting very immoral. The thing I hate most about many religions is that their goal is to convert people, instead of letting them choose. Instead of converting your spouse, just deal with the fact they are a different religion. Religion is a private thing, and it should be kept private. Also, converting is immoral. Only two major religions don't emphasize that they are the right religion and that you need convert others. Those are Bhuddism and Hinduism. Maybe the authors should give those religions a try."
3,The other side...,"The basic approach of this book is help the believing spouse understand his/her unbelieving spouse for the purpose of having him/her convert. As a former believer that deconverted after getting married, I understand the difficulties of having a spouse that no longer believes the same way that you do. I also feel that this stress is intensified when a spouse closes themselves off to the possibility that perhaps their beliefs might be the ones that are in error.I would suggest that both spouses should examine their beliefs closely, as well as the beliefs of their spouse. Openness, not agreement, should be the goal. Many believers have never critically examined both sides of the issue and may find that the cases for faith and Christ (Strobel's other books notwithstanding) aren't as solid as they were led to believe."
2,playboy lingerie,"Playboy is so modest that it's really more aggravating than anything. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone because it leaves entirely too much to the imagination. Honestly, Maxim is better."
4,Legeandary Pink Dots - '9 Lives To Wonder' (Soleilmoon),"Good mid-'90's Legendary Pink Dots release. More mellow and laid back than their more recent titles, but still very decent. Best described as neo-psychedelic. Seen them play small clubs twice now. You can never tell what 'deep album tracks' they just might play on any given U.S. tour. Tracks here I was somewhat impressed the most with were ""Madame Guillotine"", the hypnotic ""Oasis Malade"", the ten-minute ""Nine Shades To The Circle"" and ""Terra Firma Welcome"". Always good to check out one of many, {many} LPD discs that you haven't heard yet."
5,Another stellar release...,"Can't go wrong with LPD, 9 Lives To Wonder"" was created with The Silver Man on keyboards and exotic divices, Ryan Moore on bass and drums, Martijn de Kleer handling guitar and tympani, Niels van Hoornblower lives up to his surname and of course The Prophet Qa'Spel delivering the lyrics and playing keyboards and destroyed lyre. On this very special occasion Cevin Key of Skinny Puppy is the Pink Dots special guest.AVAILABLE AT SOLEILMOON records website and Strange Fortune's website for $12.00, don't pay more than this from someone who doesn't know or care about the music. $20.00 used? what a rip off!"
1,Don't buy this,"I'm new to LPD and this album has successfully put an end to further LPD exploration. Perhaps it's just me, but the music which accompanies Ed's droning, impassionate, lathargic mumbling is reminiscent of a cheap Nintendo RPG. This would be somewhat forgiveable if I was referring to the Nintendo 64 or possibly even the Super Nintendo, but I'm talking about the FIRST Nintendo. Skip this and try one of their other albums."
2,Just Wipe The Tapes...,"...down to Rita & the rhythm section & you'd have a 4 star session. Please, Reissue God, just put out Nice Feelin' & The Lady's Not For Sale so we don't have to buy this dreck to tide us over."
5,ZENO 2,"GREAT CD - YOU CAN STILL HEAR SOME ZENO TOUCHES ON THIS ALBUM - THIS GROUP ORIGINATED FROM ZENO AND THEY HAVE NOT LOST THEIR GREAT SONG WRITING - JAM THIS CD FROM BEGINNING TO END, AND ASK YOURSELF ""WHY IS FAIR WARNING NOT MORE POPULAR IN AMERICA?"" - THE REASON IS THAT ALL THE TALENTED MELODIC GROUPS TOUR AND SELL CD'S IN THE COUNTRIES THAT APPRECIATE THEM (JAPAN, GERMANY, ENGLAND, ETC) - I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING FROM FAIR WARNING THAT WAS BELOW AWESOME - ALL THEIR MATERIAL IS TOP OF THE LINE AND WORTH EVERY DOLLAR YOU SPEND"
2,Makes E. Power Biggs sound like Virgil Fox,"The otherwise acclaimed Mr. Rubsam manages to sound like ""Biggs on valium"", plodding through these works. Was he bored with'em or not that familiar with it? Ditto for the first volume. Having heard his other performances, I would've expected something better."
3,"OK, but not for beginners","I was a little dissapointed in this book. I expected more of an intro to reading comprehension, but this book assumes previous experience/knowledge. For my 3rd grader with no prior experience in ""reading comprehension"" tests, this was not a good starting point. Maybe next year. I wish they would make another book that could go before this one in the series for true beginners."
5,Bilingual and Bicultural,"This is a beautiful and colorful re-telling of the Japanese folktale, Issunboshi, in English.The oni, monsters in the story are pretty scary-looking, but my five- and seven-year-olds find the story exciting. The costumes and setting are from ancient Japan (Heian period,) and thus show another kind of kimono than that we often associate with Japanese tradition. The princess wears the twelve-layer kimono, like Masako-sama wore when she married the present Crown Prince of Japan. They also enjoy how he and his elderly parents cope with his minute size -- the use of a needle for a sword, and a bowl for a boat, capture their imagination. And they enjoy it all the more, because they`re familiar with the Japanese nursery song, included with translation at the back of the book, along with some additional illustrated information on ancient Japanese things."
3,Finding a win-win solution,"Franklin the turtle eats lots of Fly Krispy cereal to collect the SuperheroTrading cards inside. His friends follow along, even though they don't like thecereal. When Franklin finally gets two of the rare Super Cat cards, he faces aproblem of envy and fairness with his friends. He finds a kind and moralsolution that also allows him to get what he wants most. Not saccharin orheavy-handed, like many such stories."
1,didn't work as described,"This antenna never increased the reception for our Panasonic KX-TG6502B phone. The 658 antenna is attached to the telephone's antenna with ""twisty ties"". I called the customer service and never received a return call. I emailed them. I did get a response about 2 weeks later. After 2 emails when they knew I was having problems, I never heard from them again.Don't buy! It doesn't work!"
1,does not really work,"though it does extend a small amount, the attenna in no way performs as it should. i would not suggest purchasing this product to extend range."
4,Lovingkindness,"Here you will find that mercy without response is self-defeating and forgiveness without a healed relationship is empty. You will read that the time came when the only thing left for G-d to do with Israel was to divorce her. We read the heart of Hosea is reconciliation, and though G-d's jealousy is a ""fiery concern for what is precious to Him,"" Kidner's guide makes sure we understand His attributes are perfect and lovingkindness rules over them all."
5,IGGY GETS RESPECT,"Its hard to say which genre Iggy has influenced most, Punk, Grunge, Thrash, Rock, Glam etc..With Skull Ring, Iggy has teamed up with some contemporary polished quasi punks like Green Day, Sum 41 & Peaches, for a great punk/pop/rock album. Its also the return of the Stooges for a few tracks. But Iggy's songs with the Trolls rock the hardest. This isn't a return to the classic Stooges underproduced, overdistorted primal brillance but its good stuff nonetheless. The songs are excellent and there are some real standout classics like: Inferiority Complex, Blood on Your Cool, Private Hell, Loser, Perverts in the Sun and Superbabe. Overall, Skull Ring is not as great as ""Beat em Up"" or ""Raw Power"" but its pretty cool anyway."
4,The real thing.,"Iggy Pop has a brilliant concept in this day and age: why not make an honest record that is filled with solid songs since people are spending eighteen bucks for it?Of course, this idea flies in the face of the much hyped 21st century concept of letting producers and executives engineer your career based on fear of not doing something that people like, turning your record into something with one solid single and maybe a second, then mostly filler.Aside from awesome music, this is what I got for my eighteen bucks: do not engineer your life based on fear.And frankly, most people spend a lifetime and hundreds of thousands of dollars and still never learn that lesson.If records were being made as well as Skull Ring, I bet people would not be thinking twice about risking their hard-earned money on a CD.Iggy Pop still rocks."
2,Disappointing,"Anyone want to speculate the real reason why Iggy Pop employed the so-called talents of punk rock posers Green Day and Sum 41 to collaborate with? After all these years is Iggy trying to market himself towards a bigger audience. Personally, after all that Iggy Pop has been through over the years, no one deserves garners of success more than him, but his latest release, ""Skull Ring"", is a disappointment. His last album, 2001's ""Beat 'Em Up"" was underrated by many but was pure unadulturated rock Iggy style. ""Skull Ring"" for the most part just seems plain old uninspired and hastily put together. ""Private Hell"", ""Little Know It All"" and ""Supermarket"", all of which feature either Green Day or Sum 41, all sound like radio ready pop punk with Iggy's voice. All that aside though, there are some solid tracks to be found on ""Skull Ring"" like ""Loser"" and ""Blood on Your Cool"", but for the most part ""Skull Ring"" is far, far from Iggy Pop's finest hour."
2,Sad sad shadow of rock n roll,"Iggy pop and the Stooges should not have waited 30+ years to put something else out. This cd is a huge let down to me because, well let's see, the last thing the stooges put out was RAW POWER, the cd that ended up being the epidomy of kick ass pre punk rock n roll, and hearing that Iggy and the god damn stooges are back brought sweet sweet anticipation in the air. how bad could they have gotten after Raw power? Bottom line, the Stooges still know how to kick ass with thier rock n roll. Iggy on the other hand has completely lost his edge. His lyrics are insanely retarded, he's writing lyrics like the other punk embarrassments that we have to sit through on this cd; Sum (*&^ing 41 and Green Day.Sorry, after Self titled, Fun House, Raw Power, and seeing him play his tunes live you tend to expect nothing but pure rock n roll. Sadly disappointed."
4,Iggy Still Has It.,"Iggy has certainly had a Up and down career(In both senses of the words)and may have had some major duds along the way.Thankfully this isnt one of them.Sure there are moments on the album that are less than impressive(Little electric chair and whatever).But all in all the rest of the album rocks hard even duets with pop punk stars Sum 41(little Know it all)and Greenday(Private hell,supermarket)iggy still managers to make them sound pleasantly good.He also teams up with filthy mouthed industrial punk chick Peaches a couple of times(Rock Show,Motor Inn)All in all this album is the best hes done in years High points on this album are Little know it all,Rock show,Til wrong feels right,Blood on your cool and the bonus track (which starts about 3 minutes after the last track).Hey it may not be Raw power or even raw for that matter but its still worth your money."
1,WHY?!?!,"I spent three months with nothing but 'Raw Power' in my CD player, two months with 'Lust For Life', Iggy Pop is my favorite rocker of all time......but this CD is complete trash."
1,Terrible,I ordered these Lecithin caps and threw the opened one away when about 1/2 full. The capsules are weak and the lecithin leaks out. I had to take a handfull of caps and roll them between paper towels to use them at all. Then they continued leaking in a pill box. I will never order this product or any other from the manufacturer again.
2,American Politics can't really be like this,"Overall, this isn't the weakest novel I've ever read, but it's close. And I've read thousands of books. Horrible choppy sentences, and the author was redundant and uninteresting. Rather lackluster."
2,Not recommended.,"I picked this book up because of the attractive cover art. Unfortunately, the story is not good at all! I think what bothered me the most was that it seemed like a thinly veiled jab at former First Lady Hilary Clinton. But notwithstanding that, the characters seem almost programmed with rigid dialogue. At times the bad writing made me wince."
2,Not recommended.,"The plot for this book is original, and I will give the author credit for coming up with an unique idea. What was so disappointing, however, is that the English is so bad that it gets in the way of the story. To illustrate, here is an interesting example of the author's writing: ""Recently returned from a writers retreat in Rome, her short story TORN has been published in an anthology."" Oh my. This sentence claims that a short story just returned from Rome! I think Ms. Antrim was trying to say that the writer of the short story returned from Rome, but that's not what the sentence says. I hope the short story had a nice trip! Seriously, this is the kind of thing you learn about in high school English classes. Also, I think Ms. Antrim must have skipped the whole part of English where we learned about when and how to use commas. This review is too long already, so I won't give an example. To sum up: I do not recommend this book."
3,It is not that good,"I see Vince Flynn and Lee Child (one of my top favourite authors) praise this book, it was cheap, so I bought it.Starting reading, it was slow and kind of soapy. I was expecting it to pick up the pace and quality, but it did not.Cheap, but not very good. I am really puzzled by all the stars and bangles and raves this book is getting."
2,absurd and shallow,"Capitol Offense does have an intriguing premise. What happens when the grasp for political power causes people to stop at nothing, even murder, to get elected? But this book has too many evil plots that involve so many of it's characters, that it strains believability. I'm tired of the good guy, predictably named ""Jack"", who fights for the love of the green-eyed, auburned-hair beauty. She spurns him, then accepts him, then ,of course, is integral in helping him bring down the bad guys. No one is ever suspicious of the many deaths and accidents that occur during the politicians rise to power, and the ditsy, helpless electorate swallows whatever line the parties pitch. I found it difficult to finish this book because I really didn't care how it ended."
2,Capital offence,"I disliked this from the get go.would never read this author again.trite and. No realistic story line.Don,t waste your time."
3,"Great Story, Bad Editing","The plot and characters in this book are incredibly fascinating and the peek into the inner workings of a presidential election were intriguing. My problem was with the editing. Spelling errors, grammar problems and omitted words abounded. All of the issues mentioned were very distracting. I would advise doing a re-edit to put out a more correctly written book."
2,Trying to find a reason to keep reading this,"I am halfway through this book and I'm wondering when it's going to take off. So many reviewers have called it ""fast-paced,"" a ""thriller,"" etc. I'm finding it plodding and dull. I came here to re-read the reviews to convince myself to keep reading it, that at some point, something interesting will happen. So far, it's just 2,500 pages or so of character development or set-up or something...boring is the word I would use. Now I know why it was $2.99."
2,Wake me when its over,This book just went no where fast. I ended up deleting it from my kindle. Even for $2.99 it was a dud.
1,no good,confusing and dull. characters are not interesting. I don't have any more words to say about it. thank you. stella
3,Keeps your attention!,"While somewhat predictable, this book was a page turner and had a few interesting twists and turns. You pretty much have an idea of how it will end about half way through, but interesting nonetheless. Kept my attention."
3,A Very Fast Read,"Rather interesting political story, but not up to the standards of say a David Baldacci. Can be read in short time however, and does keep your attention."
3,Fast Paced Thriller,Very fast paced thriller that keeps the pages turning. Well written but a little far fetched with the story line.
4,Nice collection,"The music here won't disappoint. Shaw always sounds wonderful in my opinion. My only complaint is that the recording quality is not as good as I would have hoped. Still, I am happy with and recommend it."
3,Teacher's Pet (Project),"Tom and Dean are amazing technical masters of the vibes and bass guitar respectively, but heavy commitments to teaching and session work has kept them from following up 1979's stunning ""Whistling Midgets."" The reuniting of these two formidable forces should have been a joyeous occasion.Unfortunately the duo format, using exactly the same instrumentation on every song (I know Tom's an equally-skilled marimbist) leads to a measure of listener fatique by the end. Don't get me wrong, the music is pleasant, occasionally showy, but nowhere as immediately appealing as on ""Midgets."" True, the bar was set very, very high by their last collaboration and maybe this one should have merited four stars -- but I was disappointed.Incidentally, ""Whistling Midgets"" has been re-issued by Dan Dean Productions and is worth seeking out on his website."
2,My 2 favorite instruments...,"Duets...but a very dull affair. Granted, vibes basically have the same sound other than vibrato, but there are many options for a bass to alter it's sound. It sounds as if they recorded the whole CD with the same set-up. They are great players, but I started to nod off halfway through the CD."
4,Victorian intrigue in France,"""Intelligent, pretty, but without ""prospects,"" Elizabeth McLeod was resigned to her native Scotland and living out her days in quiet spinsterhood. But that was before she became engaged to a man whom she had known for one hour and found herself at the very center of a plot to overthrow the government of France...A marriage of convenience...that's all it was. Hector's reputation was threatened by scandal in Paris, and Elizabeth lacked a roof over her head. Each needed to get married. So they married each other.It would be a no-nonsense marriage. A business venture. Hector would carry out his assignments in the Foreign Office, while Elizabeth played hostess and ran the household. How could they have known that soon Elizabeth's very life -- andthe fate of an entire nation -- would depend on the strength of Hector's love for her?"""
1,maybe got a bad one?,"it just didn't work at all. period. it sounded like it would be perfect; but alas, perhaps i was just unlucky and received a defunct one. if not, then the compatability specs are wrong. luckily the seller was fantastic and it was no problem to have my money refunded."
1,Disappointed,"I find that I hardly use this product. The holder clip broke almost immediately and the unit does seat well with my iSkin attached. When it is connected I wasn't happy with the performance. I hoped to use this when I mountain biked, but it just doesn't perform."
4,"iPod Remote works well, but...","This new Griffin AirClick remote works well, similar to the previous design which plugged into the top of the iPod. The problem with this one is that the bottom-mounted design uses up the iPod's dock connector, so no way to connect external power or car audio (except by the headphone jack.) AirClick needs to add a pass-through dock connector on the bottom of this new AirClick."
1,Does not work with iPod classic,"I bought this item since I use my ipod in my car a lot. It seems it is not compatible with the ipod Classic. Will have to return it, and get something else."
4,very pleasant,These are well-played versions of these well-crafted works. The playing and recording quality are good. This composer wrote high quality music and these pieces are certainly representative. I would not describe this as an essential CD however. This stuff has a strong similarity to many other contemporaneous music. Probably most recommendable to those with a strong interest in Spohr or clarinet.
4,The album that made it late,"I just wonder was would be the history is we had this album instead of Guaranteed.By the way if you can get the single with the mixed version of ""love in a peaceful world"", wich is shorter and with a little more rythm, Just get it In fact there are two singles the blue and the white.If you want something more danceable, there is a version of ""learn to say no"" , mixed by K-Klass. It's the orange one. I rememember a yeloow one. but i am not shure what it was.Probably the album with most remixes that never made it to the mainstream.ahhh. I recommend the MArk King German DVD,"
4,this is a joke...right?,$125 for used copy of this cd? Look elsewhere on this site and you will find the very same Austrian import new for under $15. This listing must be a leftover from April 1st.
4,Very easy to listen to and well worth purchasing,"This CD is very easy to listen and relax to. Ranging from upbeat and slightly jazzy to romantic and moving, this music sounds better and better every time you listen to it. I found many of the songs running through my head at points during the day. I hadn't heard much from this group since the ""World Machine"" and ""Running in the Family"" days, until I recently bought this CD. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the changes in their style were slight, and an improvement, if anything. Well worth purchasing if you liked any of their previous work."
1,Another very deceptive ad,"One naturally expects that the rechargable batteries and battery charger bundled as a ""kit"" for a Canon HF-DC1 flash unit are items compatible with the flash unit. However, this is entirely false. The batteries are not compatable with the flash unit. So, now I have 8 rechargable batteries and a battery charger that are of no use at all. WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!"
1,Junk! Lens fell out first day! Stay away!,"These glasses broke the first time I used them. I went to clean the lens with a soft cloth and it fell out! Upon further inspection, I saw how cheaply they went back together.This is truly a case of ""you get what you pay for!"" Stay away!!!! DeWalt should be embarassed to have their name on these."
2,unhappy,The Dewalt glasses I ordered are very comfortable. I am happy with them except for one very important thing. The rubber temples slide on a plastic shaft and when you clean the lenses they have a tendency to come off. Needless to say if you don't see where they fall you will probably not find them. I have lost one on each of the two glasses I have. I would recommend them if they would make the rubber temples stationary. But for now I'm looking else where.
3,protective glasses,"product was as advertised. was bought for my grandson, but ordered one for myself as well. It stops anything coming staight at you, but I still get stuff in my eye when using the table saw to rip lumber."
5,Nice Relaxing CD,"When I first heard the song ""Empty Street"" by Late Night Alumni on last.fm I was so mesmorized by the vocal. It was soft and easy, yet the beats were along its vocal to give you a little move to your body. It's a really nice, relaxing CD!"
5,Late Night Alumni is gorgeous music...,"I'll keep this short.This alubum is the ONLY Trance album that touches the ""Believe"" album by 4 Strings.This is epic and soothing at the same time. I want more."
2,Meh,I can't say that this really helped. I didn't notice a difference at all and I gave it several months of trying it over and over again. I will not purchase this item again.
4,"Smells like rotten vegitables, but it works","My wife is pregnant, and she can't take most medicine, but she was told by the folks at the Birthing Center that arnicare is okay to take, so we bought some.It smells like rotting vegitables, so be aware of that, but she says it works.Aside from the smell, it's a little greasy, but you should wash your hands anyway. If you're pregnant, or if your just a hippie who is into homeopathic medicine, my wife says it works."
5,Beautiful,"This is a beautiful watch and for the price it cannot be beat. I own 3 Automatic watches and this is by far my fav. The look is different, it really stands out. It is a big watch but the titanium makes for a very light wear. I recommend this watch for those who love automatic watches but do not want to pay Rolex prices. The quality of this watch is top notch. I had this watch fitted at a high end watch repair shop for Rolex and such, nothing but compliments."
5,Pretty in Pink,Shipped and received to me right away....fast service. Well made and good fit. May order another one soon.
3,"Decent Sandy album, a lesser Fairport","There isn't a single Fairport album I don't like. That said this isn't one of my favorites. Individually the songs are really good but the overall product sounds like everyone involved was thinking about a solo rather than a collective album and is a big step down from the great ""9"" album which is probably the best of the post Richard Thompson albums. The production sounds like an attempt was made to mold them to a certain sound, whenter it fit them or not. If you're looking for great Fairport check out Full House, Leige & Lief, What We did on our Holiday, Jewel in The Crown, Nine or Unhalfbricking. For great Sandy check out Sandy, Like an Old Fashoned Waltz, or Fotheringay."
5,Rising for the Moon,"This is the quinntesential Fairport Convention album, Sandy Denny's finest vocals especially on the haunting ballad ""One More Chance"". I count this among my top ten desert island disks."
1,Awful book for youth football,"To agree with the other reviewers, these authors have obviously never coached a youth football team. I'm tired of finding all of these coaching youth football books written by college and pro coaches. Its different game, and the sooner they realize it, the better, maybe they can put out a book that worth reading.[...]"
5,The John Swiss Story,"This book is a fasinating story about the life style of living an adventureous bush life in the Alaska wilderness. It is a book that you can pick up and read at one time as I did, or you can read it a chapter at a time. The book is a series of stories told in a reflective manner of experiences of making a living in the Alaska wildeness by trapping, guiding hunters, subsistance hunting and fishing, commercial fishing, raising a family and flying as a commercial bush pilot in the state of Alaska from the 1950's to the present. The author Jeff Davis has written this book so that it captures these stories in a presntation that reflects them being written as you would be listening to John Swiss recant his stories and memories in his own words from a long unique life of making a living in bush Alaska. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that loves adventure and especially hunting."
2,NOT BOLD,I am a pen freak. I only like bold pens that do not skip. If this sounds like you then do not order these pens.
1,Definitely Not Bold: Do Not Buy If Looking For a Bold Point,"I should have read the other reviews instead of believing the misleading name of ""Jetstream Bold Point..."" I would have returned the pens if the postage was less expensive. I gave the pens one star because they are not bold points which is what I needed."
3,so over the top it's almost a parody,"The gore is so over the top it's almost a parody. The artist lives across from a guillotine and his kids play in a river clogged with filth and corpses. His wife owns a bar where the dead eat portions of their own bodies each night.I regretted buying this book until I got to the second half, where he talks about 3 generations of abuse in his family, and worshipping the mushroom cloud god. It was then that I realized why this work receives rave critical reviews. The gore in the first half represents the psyche of the people described in the second half, i.e. a whole generation of Japanese who grew up in the aftermath of Hiroshima.The images linger long after the book is closed, but I didn't adore this book the way I adore, say, Akira, or Uzumaki, which is why I gave it only 3 stars."
2,"Poorly Mixed, Re-Edited versions","Most of the remixes today are very short, like the old times, most of them are around the 5-6 minutes. With that in mind, I don't understand, why do they have to edit what it is already short? and even more mix it. The mix is nothing really special and the tracks selected are not necessarily the hottest hits, with the exception of THE SOUND OF SAN FRANCISCO by GLOBAL DEEJAYS, and STAR TO FALL by CABIN CREW. There are some other 5 good tracks but that's it!!! Then the ones mentioned are 12 inch versions edited to make them shorter to include more tracks that tell you nothing. They could have released the full 12 inch versions of 20 of the total tracks and there would still have empty space. The 2 stars are for the price and the 7 good songs (NOT FILLERS!!!!). Everywhere, Shine, Greece 2000, Flashdance, and Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!"
2,Just for workshop... Not very good. Terrible Optic,"I bought this with a tropical fantasy: To use them in mountain biking.These glasses look good, but... the glasses have terrible optical aberrations. You just what to take them off to see correctly... like wearing some else's correction glasses....I gave them 2 stars, because the of the benefit of the doubt, that someone just dot care about this, and find them just cool looking... Maybe these are just ""eye protection"", and I expected too much from this gender."
4,Safety glasses with Style!,They do a good job protecting the eyes and work well. The tinting is a good feature working in the sun. Had a few things that got deflected while working... The only thing that I do not like is that they do get scratched pretty easily.
3,A little disappointed,"Bought this for my Escalade, hoping it would improve my mpg a little but nothing. It was very easy to install and looks great. I even upgraded to dual electric fans and that didn't get me much improvement on the mpg. Oh well. Maybe I will put a diesel engine one day--that would do the trick!"
5,love it!!,i love lion bars! my friend's grandma brings them to the u.s. with her when she visits from ireland.
3,The best candy in the world but five time the price found in Europe!,The best candy bar in the world! The price on Amazon is ridiculous. My sister will bring me some from France where they are five times cheaper! Good thing she is coming otherwise I will have to quite my Lions addiction!
4,VERY GOOD.,Took a month for me to get and was packaged well. The bars were VERY fresh and natually l enjoyed them... Wish it did take as long as they did for me to recieve them but l enjoyed them anyway.. Chocolate and chewy is a very good combination...Trust me:)
2,Disappointment/Origin Questionable,"This chocolate bar tastes average at best. My memory is that the Lion bar had a better flavor (stronger chocolate taste, higher quality, etc.) the last time I purchased it in England. Perhaps the recipe has changed, but, when I looked at the ingredients on the label, I couldn't read them, as they were written in Polish. This product is seemingly not imported from Ireland as stated in the Amazon item description--or, if so, it was imported from Ireland to Poland, from whence it came. Either which way, a confectionery disappointment."
3,not what I ordered,The wire jig pictured is not the wire jig I received. The template I received does not include the four sets of pegs as pictured but only one center set of pegs which limits the shapes you can create. The instruction booklet included was for bending wire into words and had nothing to do with any peg system. Disappointed because I wanted the template pictured for the ability to create multiple shapes. The product I received limits the shapes to mainly stars and flowers. This is still a product I can use.
4,A notable start for an engaging new series!,"As the story moves, characters, suspects, and clues are introduced. Ms. Cooper gives some interesting insight into the historical characters' personalities without going into extensive detail. The straightforward writing gives the story, as a whole, a smooth delivery. Readers will be entranced with the civil war scenes and particulars, not to mention the added historical gossip blended into the storyline. Expect a well-played, well-hidden mystery, only to be solved at the end."
1,Far short of expectations,"Had to fight with the phone just to make calls.The phone felt like a remote control, not like a phone.The ringer was NOT loud enough at all.The USB adapter is so fat that it takes up the USB slot it goes in and the ones on either side of it.Already took it back to the store and bought another brand."
1,Doesn't work with Windows Vista,"After struggling to install the phone all day, I finally called the customer service number on the back of the installation guide. They said that even though they have a Vista driver for this device on their website, they are experiencing so many problems that they now consider this device not to be compatible with Vista. This was straight from the mouth of the tech on the help line. Now I need to send it back."
3,"Great company, okay product",Source Naturals put out a fine line of supplements. I was looking for a Vitamin E with more emphasis on gamma-e and this is the best I could find.
1,DON T LOSE YOUR MONEY,"TOO MANY DISCUSIONS, NOT EVEN A FULL SONG OF RITCHIE BLACKMORE'S RAINBOW IN TWO DVDS. THE THIRD DVD INCLUDES A SHOW OF RAINBOW'S LAST SINGER WITH SOME MUSICIAN NOT KNOWN TO ME.STAY AWAY OF THIS."
4,School Bag,I am a part-time teacher and as such I have to carry a lot of stuff around campus and back and forth from home. I needed something that would roll easy and hold a lot of stuff. The bag is taller and narrower than my last one but holds as much. Sturdy and there's a place for hanging files inside. Only problem is it's heavy. I guess you can't have it all.
4,Features changed from last year's model,"I had one of these that I have been using since late 2009 or early 2010 and it had a zippered pouch on the outside left side. It is not shown in one picture of the product now but in another picture it is there. When I ordered this one, I really wanted it with the zippered pouch but did not get it.The handle used to have a button that would lock/unlock allowing you to raise and lower the handle. Mine broke and that's why I had to purchase a new one. This years model does not have a button. The problem now is as long as you pull the case on the wheels, it is fine. But if you have to push it to turn it around or whatever, the handle automatically starts to collapse.Shipping to return it for repair is too much and I would be without a case for 1-2-3 weeks while they repair it. So much for a 5-year warranty.It is good and sturdy and rolls well."
3,"Laptop has to be carried inside, not in outside flap...","One other reviewer said it before - if you put anything heavy in the outside flap this thing will tip over UNLESS you do have the laptop inside the main case to counter-balance the use of the outside pockets. Otherwise, nice looking, sturdy, good handle length (longer I mean - I am tall). I just wish the main compartment was a little bigger - just another inch or two in width and a third center-leg under the outside pocket for the tipping problem."
3,SOLO Rolling Laptop Catalog Case,Works okay but the metal inserts that hold the hanging files keep coming out. It is sturdy and can hold a lot of documents inside.
4,Wish I had.,I wish I had bought this book when I first got my machine. It is chock full of information that would have saved me a few wasted moments of searching on the web.
5,Just What I Needed to Get Started!,"I have a mid-arm and a frame and have been teaching myself how to use it. There is much to learn and this reference guide has proven to be a great purchase. I love that it includes many techniques, patterns and pantographs that I have been able to put to use and practice. Another great purchase!"
5,The Ultimate Guide to Longarm Machine Quilting,"I bought this book to see what to look for in a longarm machine. I found it very informative and helpful. I also was surprised to see the information on choosing a quilter if that was what you needed. The patterns in the back were nice to have also. Over all, I enjoyed this book and feel it is a good resource if you are looking for a longarm machine."
3,Just Meh.,"What you're really getting here for your buck is Pitfall and, maybe, Keystone. What I want to know is: Did anyone feel even a little nostalgic to play anything else on this disc? Barnstorming? Boxing?! C'mon, for the price, you think they throw in at least Berzerk or Yar's Revenge. Buy it if you just have to play River Raid one more time, but if you're just in the mood for some retro game goodness, get Midway's Arcade Greatest Hits vol. 2 instead. Who needs Chopper Command when you have Spy Hunter, Joust 2 and Moon Patrol?"
3,Not as much fun as you remember,This game gives you many games for a good price but once you play it you realize that these classic games were lame. But good for nostalgia.
1,"Man, bring on the new playstation games!","The overall nostalgia of the game is overwhelming...for about two seconds. After realizing that all the games are based on the same concept, I found trying to play these games fatiguing and frustrating. I do remember playing these games on the old atari system, but I can't say that they are missed after battling through this endless pit of maddening fun. I say, bring on the new playstation games, and leave the past where it is."
5,DeeAnne Gist is a Genius. Measure of a Lady is Amazing,"Rules in the 19th century seriously bordered ridiculous. I don't know if I would have survived.-Women's boots cannot be seen or they would be deemed ""fallen.""-Women who do not wear sunbonnets are deemed ""fallen.""-Singing in front of a crowd, especially of men is a way of attracting unwelcome attention.-Gambling is a sin as well as drinking.And so on...Johnnie is so funny sometimes. He just blurts out important things out of nowhere. They're all so unexpected and so adorable.Rachel was deeply confused and troubled of how to understand the Bible and the teachings from it.I thought Rachel's entire family would break down and they won't see each other again. But it's amazing how they come together at a time of need and Rachel come to understand and open her eyes that ""fallen"" women are simply women who made mistakes that the society knew about. It doesn't make them any different than her who had her mistakes hidden behind closed doors."
3,"Good Story Line, Overly Verbose","The story line is okay, gets boring at times and is too repetitious; she frequently gets overly verbose - I had to skim through a couple of pages several times to 'get to the point'.The 3 stars I gave is pushing it."
2,Very disappointed,I was very disappointed with this book. I like to read uplifting inspirational romance. This book was very depressing and unsettling. I would not recommend it for anyone who wants to read a book with a happy ending.
1,Awful!,"I'm really glad that this was not my first Gist novel, or I would never have picked up another one. The main character is totally self righteous and thinks she has to control everything. She is also a complete hypocrite. Her sister is living a life of sin, but then she has the same kind of thoughts about the saloon owner that she likes, who tries to get her to sleep with him. It has way too many innuendos for my taste. I got this book for free, so at least I didn't spend money on it. Skip this one, and read Gist's other books instead. You won't feel better having read this."
2,Disapointing,"While the characters were vivid and the struggles presneted were true to life I was greatly disapointed that Bethany House would publish a book with so much sexual content. The author stops just short fully discribing their sexuality. I don't believe this has a place in a ""Christian"" novel."
1,Waste of hours of my life,"Rachel is a high and mighty, incredibly annoying, bossy, holier than thou, brat. When she FINALLY learns not to be such a twit, the end of the book is near. I felt for her siblings - I would have probably pulled all my hair out if I was them. That a man in the world would put up with her crap is beyond me."
1,Some things never change,"When Rachel Van Buren arrives in San Francisco, in 1849, she is greeted by a tent city of thousands of unwashed, cigar smoking, gambling, and whisky soaked men infected with gold fever. She was the only ""Sunbonnet"", the term used to describe respectable ladies, and it was up to her to teach her younger brother and sister the morals instilled by their mother. Through hard work she supplies a home for them and maintains her standards. However, she begins to understand they are too rigid for a California boomtown. Through prayer and Christian compassion, she learns the true measure of a lady. Some things never change.Buy it, read it, save it. This one is a keeper."
4,enjoyable read,Another hit from deanne gist! was a very enjoyable read. I can not wait for the next one.
2,"Liked first book, disappointed with this one","I kept looking at the credits of this book to see if it had been revised from a secular novel because that's just how it reads. It was too explicit regarding characters thoughts about sex...by secular standards I guess it would be considered tame but it ruined the book for me. For a great book that deals with temptation in a smart/funny way, tryLost in NashVegasby Rachel Hauck."
2,Disappointing,"I was really surprised at the drastic difference between this book and the author's first book, ""A Bride Most Begrudging."" In the first book, the relationship between the two main characters began sweetly and gradually. In this story it seems crude, forced, rushed and awkward. Other than that, it just lost my interest, not caring what happened to the any of the characters, so I couldn't even bring myself to finish it. I would recommend the author's first book, as it was much more enjoyable."
4,Book 2,Lady wasn't quite as entertaining as Gist's first book. It is a bit evident that she was under time restrictions with her contract. It's an enjoyable read without the enthralling bite of the debut.
3,A Good Read,"The book is well written and has a good story line; however, it went on a bit long for me. I found it to be a little repetitive. The end didn't tie things up well for me either and that took something away from it for me as well. I wouldn't read this one again."
2,Unlike any other work of Gist's,"I thought this book was very surprising for so many reasons. Gist's stories are usually so smooth sailing and unmessy. Two people with Christian values and beliefs meet and presto... you have a couple. But this one was interesting because it taught me about how even the best of intentions can get lost in our own agendas. And being Christian doesn't mean you have a license to judge others. The hero being a former missionary was also a big surprise. And the way he grew to love the heroine was a lot less mushy. I like mush. The book was all in all really good, but it wasn't hilarious like the synopsis promises. The only funny part I thoroughly enjoyed and still smile about is *SPOILER ALERT* the part when Rachel gets into the carriage with her suitor and Johnnie. And Johnnie keeps winking at her and blowing in her ear to annoy her. I just grinned full out at that. So cute."
4,Great Novel!,"Another great novel from Deeanne! Not too long, full of great dialogue and sprinkled with historical facts. I personally liked Maid to Match a little better but this is still a book I'll read over and over again!"
3,Are we supposed to like any of the characters?,"This is a great book. I definitely enjoyed reading it, the plot not only makes sense but delivers a powerful ""Thou Shalt Not Judge"" message. I was just left to wonder if we were supposed to like any of the characters? The younger brother is a menace to society (an inconsistent), the younger sister is a prideful lady of easy virtue, the older sister is such a stoic prude I couldn't begin to relate to her. This book is an exercise in frustration. However, while I understood the author's point, I would hesitate to recommend this book to anyone I knew."
2,The Measure of a Lady,"The Measure of a Lady had all kinds of wonderful history and colorful word pictures of the scenery, but this was definitely not a rated G book. There were many passage a sexual innuendo or just plainly put in several places. This book was too steamyfor a Christain label."
1,Absolutely dreadful,Naxos should be ashamed of putting this out. The performance is dreary. I agree avoid at ALL cost.
5,"A great book, chock-full of information. A must have!!!","This is a wonderful book, lovingly written and illustrated by the Campanelli's.It is full of info and is an interesting, delighful read. A must have for your Pagan library."
2,"Very Gooey, and No Flavor","These bagels are very sticky in the mouth, while being very, very plain. They have almost no taste, and are difficult to chew."
1,what a piece of junk,"The camera saves files in .tod format instead of .mpg which is unrecognizable to most every video editing software forcing you to pay to download conversion software and codecs. I spent several frustrating hours trying to just get my computer to recognize the camera and still couldn't import the files to imovie, final cut, or on windows vegas 6. Apparently a lot of people are having problems with this camera just google it and read all the posts on help forums. What a waste of money!"
3,No RAW output ?,"Right now I will take a wait and see approach towards JVC's offering. All the research I've done indicates that the GZ-HD7 can only output the video in MPEG2 mode. This is great if you never do any video editing, other than time splices, on your computer.One has to wonder how the video quality will hold up, compared to HDV (1080x1440), once the video stream is decompressed for editing then recompressed back to MPEG-2."
2,Not exactly what i expected,Pros:HD 60gbSizeResolution and quality just for outdoor eventsCons:poor picture qualityVOD file extension - hard to use Adobe PRemiere Pro 2.0 for editingNo nightshotNo lights supportPoor quality for pictures and video indoors ( forget to buy it if you don't have enough light to record a indoor event.no charger included in the package !!!!!I.link cable is not compatible to Cyberlink software.
3,Missing important details,"The biggest problem I have with these articles, reviews and even the manual is that important things are missing. Is the Mic in jack mono or stereo? what is it's low light capability? What video editing apps is it compatible with? What kind of image stabilization does it use? gyroscopic prisms or the cheap method used in most consumer camcorders? Battery life? does it last the full 5 hours that you can record? resolution of the viewfinder and flip out monitor, can you see clear enough to focus? will it take an external monitor during recording? will it stream the video out the firewire connection so I can use some pro laptop utilities to see a larger monitor as as well as a scope and other items when recording?Lots of information missing for a camera that is trying to be sold as a higher end pro-sumer level camera."
4,Can not take a picture while shooting a video?,"Disclaimer: I don't own this product and this is not really a product review. I gave it a 4 star rating because that is the average rating on this product at this time.------------------------I looked at this camcorder at a local store yesterday. I couldn't figure out how I can take a still picture while shooting a video (simultaneously) using this device. Most high-end cameras and camcorders have that feature these days and I use it a lot with my camera. I don't think that feature is supported by this camcorder, but if you disagree with my observation, please post a comment to this message."
3,OIS Issues,"I just spoke with JVC customer support and they acknowledged that the OIS in the GZHD7 is 'weak'. He said the issue is mechanical and that no fix or patch will be released for the current model. Instead, they plan to address the issue in the next model, possibly due out in the March/April 2008 timeframe. He made the point (confirmed by many in these posts) that the other features easily make up for the the lacking OIS capability."
4,Pros and Cons of HD7,"Some thoughts on the HD7 performance:PROs:1. 3CCD camera2. Good built, better than most consumer HD cameras3. Auto features for what's listed below4. Manual focus ring, very cool5. Manual aperture adjustment6. Manual shutter adjustment7. Has a cold shoe mount8. Has a microphone jack9. Viewfinder works even for replay10. Saves on a hard drive or SDHC. Awesome!CONs:1. Colors are overexposed or tends to blow out the whites, better outdoors than indoors2. Low light needs tweaking to work. Performance disappointing.3. Tripod hole (at least mine) is larger than average. Not good."
4,Slack be here forever!,"This is a wonderful collection of humourous stories in the subgenius mythos. From big players such as the Rev. ""Stang"", to New Wave musician Mark Mothersbaugh (from DEVO), many authors have attempted to caputre the essence of SLACK provided by JHVH1 through his Earthly minion, BOB! Get your 'Frop here! (Watch out for the Stark Fist of Removal. Slack be Eternal!)"
2,Return to form? Nahh...,"'Can Our Love' was truly weak, but I had high hopes for this one when I'd read promising reviews.Unfortunately this is nearly as bad. Quite bland, listen to it a few times and it really starts to fade from memory. At least 'Can Our Love"" took some chances, this goes nowhere. I'll also mention that I saw them on the tour to support this album and it was a very dull show as well. Saw them live after albums one and two and they were magnificent (even though Stuart was very drunk at one show I saw). The new songs are weak, they sound like out-takes, there's no way around it. What's happening? Disagree? Then I'll ask you-if you wanted to turn a new fan on to Tindersticks would you play them ANYTHING from this album? No way! Why are their albums getting worse, not better, as they mature? There is a problem here.I'm not giving up yet, but..."
3,Better Than the Last One ... But Not by Much,"If you love Tindersticks you will forgive this record; if you don't know them, it is a harmless, lightweight introduction to their majesty. Sorry to be the dissenting voice here, folks, but I think this album pales in comparison to ""Curtains"" and ""Simple Pleasures."" It isn't very complex and overall has a thinner sound to it -- and it is sorely hurt by Dickon's lackluster, conventional voice taking over so many vocals from Stuart's aching croon. I won't say it's Tindersticks-by-the-numbers because it's pleasant enough and has some wonderful stuff on it (""My Oblivion"" is out-of-this-world fantastic in the grand, lush ballad tradition that would make Scott Walker proud ), and it's still better than ""Can Our Love,"" but let's not overrate it, okay?"
3,Higher Expectations,"The sound bytes offered by Amazon were intriguing enough for me to purchase this disc.However, after listening to it in it's entirety, I'm not so sure it was a good idea onmy part. The band that backs Bo are really good. The problem lies in that the whole dischas a feeling of being caught in a loop. It never really goes anywhere. It's like a 40minute intro. You're listening, the groove's got you but the songs never really take youanywhere beyond a basic funk. I'm not saying it's a bad disc, I just had higher hopes...The packaging on the CD is top notch."
1,Does not contain all Keats' poems,"Contrary to the title of the book, this edition does not contain all of Keats' poems. I purchased it especially for the odes, and these are not included in the book. I am very disappointed and will likely not purchase another kindle product again."
5,Keats lives,"The miniscule and sickly John Keats may not have been long for this world but he is an immortal of English language poetry. The accesibility of Keats's great poems is the reason he continues to be read while those who dismissed him in his own day have been swept into the ashcan of literary history. What's great about this complete edition is right there in the title: It's complete, allowing the Keats enthusiast to travel through all of Keats's romantic attempts, ranging from great to mediocre to poetic fumbles... The Keats novice can start with the major poems and odes and marvel, as I once did, how one so young created such a vast quantity of work. This edition also features valuable notes and the trajically short biography of Keats."
2,"No odes, and still no table of contents",As a previous reviewer noted this edition is not the complete poems - it doesn't have the odes. And the editors have still (25 June 2011) not added a linked table of contents. This is really not good. The days when providers for Kindle could charge $3.99 for out of copyright works with such woefully adequate editing are long past.
4,Romantic Poetry,"I purchased this book at Amazon.com recently,mainly for two reasons one that my parents had a book of John Keats,and secondly because in it there was a favourite work of my late wife,the book is up to my expectations,the index at the back of first lines and titles is very handy it is also nicely presented and priced."
1,Won't Last,You really would be better off buying a roll of toilet paper. It would last longer and absorb more water.These towels have been washed mybe 5 times are are falling apart.
4,great value,towel didn't shed. its water absorption is good. it's soft and not too thick. I've used it over a month and so far so good. a lot better than the bbby's generic towels which cost twice as much.
4,versatility and panache,"Really this set contains some of Fairports best-loved songs, from the olde-English Hexamshire Lass and Polly on the Shore to the epic Bring em Down. This album rocks as well as 'Folks'.For thumping,crunching danceability listen to the raunch of Possibly Parsons Green.Swarbs fiddle gets a work out too and Trevor Lucas was at the pinnacle of his song-writing prowess.Probably on of their most accessible albums and if you only have to have one Fairport set,this would'nt be a bad place to settle."
4,the last good fairport recording,if you can't get enough fairport and you already have their late 60's/earlly 70's stuff i would go for this next..after this album they lost their sound somehow..late 70's AOR production??
1,"Missing ""special knife""","This product says that it has a ""special sushi knife"" included and there was no knife in my package.Product Description5-in-1 miracle mold Sushi Master will let you prepare Heart shaped sushi as well as large, small, square , round, and triangular shaped sushi at home! The 5-in-1 miracle Sushi Master will let you make delicious, professional quality sushi with appearances even the greatest Sushi chefs would admire. Kit includes: Includes sushi molds, easy-to-follow instructions and recipe book, spatula, serving fork, and a ****special sushi knife with a superior non-stick coating on blade for easy cleaning.****"
1,Bad Choice,"I purchased two of these thinking that they would be great for my daughter and I, we had taken classes to learn how to make Sushi and when we got this and tried it we found it to be a big waste of money.It is a silly machine that does not work at all...if you want to make sushi use a mat, it is much easier. This is a bad choice and waste of your money."
2,"Great book, but it is old now","This is a great reference if you have an older OS. It came out in 1999, so it does not cover Windows XP let alone Vista."
3,"Beware, Watson!","I was almost crushed when I recieved my book. This is another example of marketing ploy. It is a rerelease of The Mammoth Book of New Sherlock Holms Mysteries under a new title and new ISBN number. As with my colleague, the stars are only for the hard cover, not for being gyped AGAIN with a rerelease with different title, ect. We want new stories, not rereleases of books already collected, however attractive you make them! Quoth the Raven..."
5,Nice Study Gde,"This study guide is a nice review. However, I had trouble finding the answers as I homeschool and wanted to correct my son's work. The answer key is ISBN 9780078660924 and is a great tool when used with this Student Study Guide and the text."
5,THE BEST CAPRICES EVER............... !,"With this recording you don't ever need to listen to ANY other recordings of the Paganini Caprices, Unless Paganini himself. I have many recordings, including with some ""legends"" of the violin, but, Most of them are really OFF-KEY, but very near, that's irritating! On this recording if you even posess Perfect Pitch like Me, you won't listen to any note off-key. Perfection is here. And very Passionate also!10 stars for this recording!"
1,Wrong connector,The fan did not have the right connector one for my external hd which was not really the vendor's fault.
2,Noisy at high RPMs.,"Built well, but you have to connect this fan to a RPM reduction device in order to stop the whining."
4,Chicago's Dark Underbelly circa 1900,"This is a well documented expose on the underbelly of Chicago, that 'big shouldered' metropolis. Deliciously lurid, fascinating and infuriating accounts of the birth of the labor and socialist movements, lots of police and political scandal and corruption, murder and mayhem - including a gruesome chapter on the notorious HH Holmes, racial tensions, assorted vice (drugs, prostitution, gambling) and a whole lot more. Lots of colorful pre-Capone thugs and characters."
2,So Close....,"Very soft and absorbent. I like that part. But you know what I don't like? I don't like having to constantly clean my bathroom floor because there are blue fuzzy pieces of towel all over the place. And yes, I've washed them 6 or 7 times."
4,So soft I couldn't believe it!,"I purchased these for my new apartment. Because of the price I was worried about the quality. But I figured it was worth a gamble based on other reviews.I am so pleased with these towels! They're SO super soft and absorbant. They've been washed several times and dried and haven't lost any of the softness.If I had one complaint, it's that I can't seem to get rid of the fuzzies. They've been washed and dried in commercial machines, but still get some blue fuzzies on me while I'm drying. I'm hoping it stops soon!"
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I ordered two sets of the bath towels and matching hand towels.A little disappointed to find out that the dye lots for the two sets are different - would've preferred hand and bath towels to match. The size and quality are very mediocre. Free shipping or not, any TJ Maxx beats this value any day of the week.Would recommend these only if you're looking for a seasonal update to your bathroom decor. But don't be fooled by seemingly great value - this is not a lasting investment."
5,"Thick, Soft, Absorbent and Inexpensive","I purchased 8 2-packs of these bath towels along with the bonus wash cloths and using a coupon that was avialable for Kitchen and Housewares was able to get 16 bath towels and 16 wash towels for under $47. These towels are extremely thick and and soft. The towels are 27"" x 52"" and have a three-stripe dobby border. I have not had any lint problem at all as others have complained about and have them in white, cameo and twilight. I have washed them many times and they still appear new and I have no problems with stitching or fraying. I would recommend them especially if you buy in quantity and use a coupon if available."
3,Eh...it's a Target/Kmart towel,I took all the advice and washed the towels prior to using them. No lint problem but they faded to the same shade as my 6 month old towels in one wash. These are beach house towels and will be washing the car next summer.
3,One Flaw,"I purchased a combination of sizes of the Navy bath towels, hand towels and washcloths, eight in total. Before I used them, but after one washing, three of the eight had a three or four inch thread that had pulled from the center of the towel. I trimmed them and I don't notice any evidence of damage. I think they are nice looking and thick and if they don't pull again, I'll be happy with the towels but I thought that was a big coincidence that three had that happen to them."
5,Great towels!,We really enjoy these towels. They are soft and absorbent. I have not seen the lint problem that others report. As for the size they are the same size as my other towels from the competitors but much cheaper! You can't beat this deal.
4,great cd - blues guitar with tone to die for...,"This is the 1st cd I have purchased in a while that I can honestly listen to each song and enjoy. Every song is good. And the guitar is the shining star. Anyone interested in playing blues guitar should listen to this. Trower has great feel and tone -while not over playing. A blueprint of great blues guitar. The vocals are also good. Pattison is singing with passion. Especially on track #9. Shining Through is a great song all the way thru, with extremely strong guitar. The only complaint I have on this cd is the fade outs. Every song has too quick of a fade out. For God sake, let Trower wail!!! A few songs almost fade before pattison can get his last vocal in. Being a guitar player myself, I definitely want to hear more. Maybe that is the point, but I feel this could have been a major cd if the sweet sounding guitar being played by a true legend was allowed to playout on the endings."
1,Anyman's Blues,"I love Robin but I have to tell you this was a most disappointing effort. Nothing on this CD reveals the magic that Robin can create. He just recycles old tired blues lines that you've heard a million times. He has so many better albums you can skip this one. Note that no album (even his live ones) recreate how good he is live. If he's ever in your town, go see him!"
4,The Brightest Blues,"Classic Trower and Pattison. Particulary the tracks ""Inside Out"", ""Someday Blues"", ""Sweet Little Angel"" and ""Shining Through"". They're reminiscent of the old Trower blues and are sure to grab your soul."
3,No offense,"I have been a fan of Robin Trower for a long time and not missed many opportunities to catch a live show. This cd won't totally disappoint nor will it move you to rave about it to all your friends.It seems to me that Robin is still longing to capture the growling vibrance of the James Dewar days. Davey Pattison has a great voice and I think his work here helps evoke some of those long lost memories.It is the playing I guess. Technically proficient, just not very inspiring for the most part. You see the names here, Reg Isidore, Dave Bronze...wow, this is going to be something special! I must give it a few more listens and certainly will, right now, it is just another addition to my collection, something to be seen but not heard too much."
5,Really Good Blues Album By Trower,"Robin Trower's playing has always been influenced by Jimi Hendrix and the blues but, until this CD, Trower has never released an entirely blues based album.As the title suggests, this album is all blues. It features original compositions by Trower along with covers of standard blues tunes like Robert Johnson's ""Crossroads.""Great material throughout. Trower's guitar playing is, as always, superb.It's a great album and I've given it a 5 star rating, but Bridge of Sighs and Trower's newest album ""The Playful Heart"" are still the best Trower albums and the standards by which I rate all Trower CDs.This is a great album that's worth adding to your Trower collection, but it doesn't surpass Bridge of Sighs or Playful Heart."
5,This is like Lazer Tag with robots!,"I only take this out for my kids once in a while because it makes so much noise indoors. My neighbor has a large cement area in her backyard and this is terrific there. We have two sets, so my 7 year old can play against his 5 year old friend. You can either have both players play against the robots or have the kids be on teams with their robots. It's a lot more fun with two sets. I don't think it's so exciting to play alone against the robot and my son has never requested to do so."
4,Concise Federal Law Review,"This book was provided to us by our college of pharmacy in preparation for the MPJE. It provides a concise review of federal pharmacy law, but was not as helpful as the Florida-specific review packets and classes."
4,passed the test - can't complain,Much better than trying to read the laws and statutes yourself!! And written in a way that's easy to read that puts information of similar topics together.
3,OK but...,"I love Jene Jano's Beethoven piano sonata series on Naxos. They are fine interpretations across the three periods of Beethoven's work. Haydnesque when they need to be and fluid and profound in the late sonatas. His take, while technically proficient, on the Eroica Variations seems a little trivial. He seems to see them in the same light as the Woo sets of variations, not seeing them in the light of the early part of Beethoven's middle period. The best for that is Glenn Gould. This isn't Glenn Gould. BTW, I'm not a big Glenn Gould fan, but he does this work best."
3,Disappointing!,"Okay, first I have to say that I simply adore Shannon Drake's first three books of her vampire series, so when this one came out I was very excited. Well, it turned out to be a huge disappointment. The book did get better towards the very end, but it took a lot of effort to get there. The main characters in this book did not really interest me."
3,Disappointed,"The previous reviewers have said it all really.I awaited this book quite anxiously. I couldnt get involved with the characters at all and in fact the only question I have is when did Ragnor get married?? Have I forgotten?? The ""stars"" of this book had no impact on me at all. I can only hope along with everyone else that the next one is as good as the previous books that had us all up all night reading!"
3,Not up to the rest of the series,"Two married musicians with a history of problems go to Salem for a Halloween gig and meet witches and demons. I loved the other books of the series but this one was a real effort to get through. I stuck it out til the end which improved once the Alliance characters arrived, but as a person who can read two to three books a day, this one killed my whole weekend. I will continue to read the series as I hope this was a fluke."
4,"what I think about the book, that it is great",Has a good story plot and follows in that idea. It is a good love story as well as a mystry story.
1,Such ridiculous crap.,"Library Journal says ""...fans will be waiting for this one."" I imagine that prior to being cut, it said ""ONLY fans will be waiting for this one."" As the culmination in a series of paranormal romances mainly centered on vampires, this one certainly did disappoint.The two main characters are already married at the start of the novel, which is odd for a romance, but that doesn't mean they bicker any less or trust each other any more. And theirs is the love that is supposed to conquer all, including a centuries old demon that even Lucian doesn't know how to deal with. Whatever.I also think this series of books has the same (really terrible) editor. I have continually been stunned by the myriad errors in each book, mostly of the variety spell check doesn't catch ('a time to reap and a time to sew"", for example).Really, I'm quite chagrined that I wasted so much time reading this series."
1,What a let-down!,"By the time I reached page 150 or so and STILL didn't know what was going on, I was ready to put down the book. The only thing that stopped me was a mention of Jade DeVeau, the heroine from 'When Darkness Falls'. Even that wasn't enough to keep me going past page 200.I expected this to be another vampire book, and it's not. I expected it to be a romance, and it's not. I expected it to be good, and, well......"
2,Disappointing and tedious,"I am usually a fan of Ms. Drake's. Although I find most of her books take a long time to ""get going"", I am usually rewarded with a wonderful story and an ending that comes too quickly. The Awakening however not only takes forever to get going, but ultimately it goes nowhere!!!! I kept hoping it would get better and there would be a story worth reading, but....no. When I finally finished it, I was left disappointed and discouraged. Don't waste your time on this one. You will do much better with one of her earlier novels."
1,Disappointing,"I found this to be one of Ms. Drake's most tedious paranormals. It took ages to get the plot moving. We were constantly told of the fog and dreams and how evil the hero was and on and on it went. When the ending came, and it came quickly, it was a relief. It seemed that Ms. Drake realized she was out of space and quickly brought the story to a conclusion. The ending was totally unworthy of the investment of time you put in. I wouldn't recommend this book. It really isn't consistent with her other paranormals."
1,Desperately in need of an editor,"This book has all the elements of a bad novel.First: No one apparently proof read this book before it was published. It's full of spelling and grammar mistakes, the main character's name changes several times etc...Second: It is excruciatingly redundant. There's this blue fog. It's blue on the first page. It's blue on the last page.It's blue on every page in the middle. Wiccan's are good, satanists are bad. On every page. Don't worry if you don't get it the first fifty times, it will be explained over and over to you.Third: There's nothing really sexy about it. It's not enough to tell readers that something is seductive... show them!In short, the novel is an insult to the intelligence (and literacy skills) of readers."
2,I should have listened to the other reviewers,"I am a big Shannon Drake Fan and have read every book. I ordered the book even with all the negative reviews. I am two weeks into the book and am slowly plodding thru it. (I normally read 1-2 books a week). This is not Shannon's best........I do not recommend it for first time readers of Shannon's work, but if you are true fan you'll pick it up and read it..........."
5,The very best book and method on singing.,"Thank you Miriam Jaskierowicz Arman, for your wonderful book about singing. It has changed my life, and my voice for the better, in many ways. After three years of opera lessons,(with the bel canto method), my teacher had me working on vocal exercises, no singing, because of being in my throat. After 3 days of working with your methods, my voice sounded like hers did, when she showed me how it was done. Now songs with high notes, are a joy to sing, knowing I will sing every note well...too many good things to say, just so thankful to be able to study with your book every day. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to sing at their best. It gives a freedom and joy to the voice I've not found anywhere else."
4,don't get ahead of yourself,"i read the book once so far. it's really good, don't get me wrong. but all the gushing reviews make it out to be *the* life-altering missing link that you've sought your whole life to instantly unlock your singing potential. i think the book sends you off in the right direction towards developing a healthy and hopefully beautiful voice. but you, unfortunately, will still have to be patient and put in some hard work. so yes, the book is great, but keep in mind that miriam is not god."
5,Great spice for apple pie!,"Whole netmeg is hard to find when you live in a small town, so I bought this on-line...I love the taste of freshly ground nutmeg in my home made apple pies! It is great in pancakes and other baked goods too."
3,ok,product is great.perhaps i have wrong size. its tight and it hurts on. its my weight and not the product.
3,Mixed Bag,"I guess I'd lump this into the ""Typical Hendrix Tribute Disc"" bin. When I saw the list of musicians performing on it, I had really high hopes. A few of the songs approached my expectations but on average, I found too many of them to be lackluster and sort of generally uninspired. For example, I'd hoped for an incredible ""I Don't Live Today"" from Pat Travers and instead got a so-so reading. I liked Lukather's 3rd Stone and part of Larry Corylell's House Burning Down plus parts of a few others but overall, I just wasn't moved by the mix."
4,Deep,Really well written book. It is a bit wordy in places and takes time to digest the material. This is not a fast read; but a paced approach to the material does yield positive results. The opinions expressed in this book are well balanced also.
5,Beams of joy,"Peter Bakowski's first collection of poems won the Premier's Award in 1996, and it's not hard to see why. In magical, crystaline and wholly original prose Bakowski traverses the melancholic night-time world made familiar by the Beats and the eminent Hart Crane. The cinematic poems in this book shoot out beams of such joy, humour and wonder at the life we lead that you'll be clamouring for Bakowski's upcoming collection, 'The heart at 3 am.' Dmetri Kakmi"
3,Pressurized RO storage tank,"The tank seems to be working OK. It had a small dent that probably occurred during manufacturing not shipping. Since it is under sink, inside the cabinet it is not an issue.I gave it 3 stars because it came without any documentation.There is no certificate if it has been tested for pressure, or clean enough inside for drinking water. The pressure valve, covered with a cap, says that only professionals should touch it.I am not a tank professional but would like to know what the set pressure is, just in case..."
2,Horrible printing,"This book looked like it had been sitting in a box of misshapen objects since the time it was first published. Also, and there are several pages that are simply not readable. It looks like it was corrupted in the printing process itself, as the ink is smeared so badly on some paragraphs that they simply are not readable. I bought the book as a gift and will have to purchase it from someone else, as this copy is no good. I gave it two starts, because at least I got it, although it took a long time.I know the book itself to be excellent reading, however. Just this copy is particularly bad."
2,cool lantern,This was a very fun lantern but was too easily dismantled by my curious 5 year old. I would buy it again.
3,Standing up for what they do,"'N Sync is one of the most -if not THE most- noticeable and best boy bands arouns these days, introducing their third album after the smash that was NSA they now bring a new sound with better lyrics and the same teenage girl-catching looks, they stand up for what they do in an outstanding way, good for them!"
1,This song is really bad...,"This song is lame and desperate. When 'N Sync finally goes away the defensive and might I add ""offensive"" lyrics in this song will come back to haunt them."
5,Does the job!,I ordered this key hook wall hanging for my Florida house and it did not disappoint. It is lightweight yet the hooks seems sturdy. It holds 4 sets of keys and can be securely mounted onto the wall. The colors are true to picture. we are quite happy with this purchase.
4,Early performance by Allan Holdsworth,"Some interesting jazz-rock from the early days. The second album on this compilation, Belladonna, is particularly of note because it includes Allan Holdsworth on guitar, early in his career, at around the same time he was playing in Jon Hiseman's Tempest. There are only a couple of guitar solos, but wow! In addition there is a lot of nice comping, and one one number he uses a wah, which I don't recall him ever doing before.(Apparently Allan is not happy with his appearance on this album, but I don't see why - he plays beautifully.) Perhaps best of all, I thought perhaps this music was going to be a bit on the tepid side, but it's not at all. The writing and playing are of quite a high caliber."
1,"""Solar Plexus-Belladonna"" Attack","I bought this CD for one reason: It has the greatest guitar player who ever lived on it: Allan Holdsworth. However, of the 30 or so CD`s I have which feature Allan, this CD is the one and only one that I consider total rubbish. I think it should either be left where it is found, or placed in the trash can. This is no fault of Allan`s of course. It`s just a bad CD."
3,"A good, not great, live album","This live album was recorded in Australia in 1974, when Fairport was touring behind the album ""Nine"". Happily, not only are there no songs from that weak album here, but Trevor Lucas is limited to one lead vocal because his wife Sandy Denny rejoined the band during the tour. ""Matty Groves"", ""Sloth"", and ""Rosie"" are all here, but there are better live versions of all three available on the market. The highlights are the instrumentals: ""Fiddlestix"", ""Dirty Linen"", and ""Sir B. MacKenzie"" (the original title of the latter once held the Guinness record for longest song title), and Denny's menacing ""John the Gun"".(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)"
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this DVD to see Maradona's games before and after the 1986 world cup where his performance was spectacular. The DVD was incredibly disappointing: There were very few clips of his earlier or post 1986 games and even these were shot from very poor angles. The documentary seemed to concentrate on the political and the social context of Latin football, most of which appears to have been dubbed from television. Very few games, very little insight into Maradona's life. It included is goals in 1986 which most people saw but not much else.Big Rip off."
2,Don't be this Cheap !!!,It rarely attaches correctly and almost never locks down so it leaks and rarly fills the tire with air and never completely. Not to mention the secondary way for the pump to connect is weak and fails constantly. Expect to loose your water bottle holder.
5,each viewing gets deeper to one's true self,"I have seen Eve's Fire three times so far, and at each sitting I am drawn to a certain part of the film that I was not drawn to the other times. A particular part of the film will draw me in,up close and personal. I can not ignore it when it is right there in my face! I become aware of what is evoked in me and just notice what happens. Do I want to cry, scream, jump up and down-- what!?Thank you Sheila, Kirsten and The School for Women Healers for making this wonderful EVEocumentary!Marguerite L Fries"
5,I really,"like every track on this album. they were all unique, and yet managed to fit together. Mondo grosso should be more well known, his music is very fun and accessible, without feeling superfluous, or meaningless! check him out, for sure."
2,Serious flaws--I'm disappointed by my fellow reviewers.,"The author uses browser version sniffing to achieve cross-browser DHTML, which means your code WILL break in the future if you follow his advice. Object detection is the way to go. I'm angry about the way this joker discusses CSS2 positioning properties such as float, clear, and position. He simply says, ""These aren't supported the same way in all browsers, so just avoid them for now."" I guess he has no faith in his own flawed cross-browser techniques! Hah! There are a couple good examples for beginners on how to hide and animate menus, but they are all heavily based on his terrible cross-browser javascript code. Finally, this book is very short. To make things worse, the pages are small, and the font-size is big. I recommend the 1400 page ""Dynamic HTML - The Definitive Reference"" second edition by Danny Goodman."
1,Not very essential CSS or DHTML,"The name of this book is not descriptive. While it is written on CSS & DHTML, it by no means includes anything essential on these techniques. The book is limited to a few code examples. With the help of these snippets, it discusses how to write some nice effects on your web site. While the examples look nice, they are no good for learning CSS, nor DHTML. If you're about to make animated menus or interactive quizzes with JavaScript, this code might be a good starting point, but don't expect to learn the CSS & DHTML in full. Not for beginners. The appendices include references on CSS + JavaScript, and are probably the best this book has to offer. However, they are based on the now outdated browser versions 4.x. That's amazing since the book was published in 2001, when most people are already using versions 5 or 6."
2,It's an ok game,My son and I didn't find this game that great. It's only 1 player which doesn't make it any fun if other people want to play. The controls are very touchy and it's hard to figure out what direction your supposed to go.
2,Not the best game...,"A bug's life the game is based on the movie, A Bug's Life. I personally felt the game to be a bit of a let down. The game doesn't allow you to save unless you buy an additional saving cartridge. The game also isn't all that interesting. The best ages for this game is probably 8 and up. Younger children may not understand the purpose of the levels and may get sick of the game very quickly."
4,"Good Game, Bad System","This was made for the PS1 and it shows. There are a lot of technical differences, and I prefer the PS1 version by far."
3,Slow start,"We received this game long before the estimated time that we were given, so that was great. We could not get the game to work the first 10 or so times that we tried it. I emailed customer service and got a response the next day. Their suggestion worked and all is good now."
3,Some thing is missing,There is some thing missing. The graphics are very good. But it lacks gameplay. But the feature and price pay off. So do your self a favor and try to get it used.
2,NOT GOOD,"THIS GAME HAS GOOD EFECTS BUT IT'S BORING, AND ITS EVEN MORE BORING IF YOU DONT HAVE A CONTROLLER PAK"
2,Too Hard for kids,"This is The Most frustrared game in the market, you really want to keep going but after the 7th level you have not clue where to go."
3,"Beautiful sound, good technique, but boring","A classic example of a technician with a beautiful sound - in fact, a perfectly clean, articulate, resonant cello sound. This man would probably be a great teacher. However, the music of Bach is not brought to life, but is rather placed at the service of this man's craft.Stick with the great recordings."
1,a weak release,"this is exuma's cd lowpoint. not only are two cover tunes poor, but the whole release is a push towards trying to commercialize and market exuma, an impossible feat. in my opinion, exuma's best cd is his first one. it captures the obeah man at his traditional and best musical roots. by the time this release came out, bob wyld, an ardent supporter of exuma was gone. the less said of this release the better. look for his first two cd's if you want the obeah man's night tripping best. used copies for $50+ ? not anywhere worth it."
3,Evangelism,"There are no secrets in this book. It is an intersting read, but it takes the same approach that many are using today - developing relationships and using those relations to share Christ. However, the cautions make the book especially worthwhile."
3,We Can Relate!,"This simple, straightforward workout and the brief instructor talk can get you off the couch and moving (again). You can easily adapt the exercises to any fit level. But, beware: the production values aren't good and it's a bit short on creativity in the moves and the music. The best part is seeing yourself reflected among the women on the DVD who are exercising, succeeding at it, and enjoying it. It's more an inspiration piece than a DVD we actually use a lot. Thanks for providing this alternative view of home exercise instructors and students--it's an important contribution to the landscape and hopefully the next one in the series will be improved."
2,Not Very serious music.,"Though this lady has a beautiful voice, it cannot make up for songs that do not do her justice. This album is quite fun, but a little repetative in its theme, and in my view there are only a couple of good songs. Very poppy and of its time, but now quite dated."
5,Shocking Amish Mayhem,"Eddie Gingerich is a pretty frightening example of the downside of living in an isolated, doctrinal community. He was headed over the edge and there wasn't much in his community frame of reference to get him the help he desperately needed. The book is impossible to put down. The publisher has helpfully provided an unintentional promotional gimmick by printing ""Crimson Stain"" with such cheap, smelly inks and paper that you begin to sympathize with Eddie as he works away in his shed, inhaling the ""petrochemical fumes"" which allegedly contributed to his insanity. It's a whole new way to bring the reader into the book's world. Fisher is a good true crime writer, and it's involving from start to finish."
5,"Who's to blame, here","It's too bad that Ed could not get the help he needed. I think Dave and Dr. Terrill are as much to blame for Katies death as is Ed. I hope Dr. Terrill has thought about this every day since the murder. And Dave, well maybe he can see now everyone does not believe the same as he does and he should not push his belief on someone else, no matter what he think's is right. Poor Ed was confused enough without Dave adding to it. As far as Dr. Terrill, I've know about him since I was a kid in the 50's. He can't be with it too much himself to massage a man's head for mental illness. Dr. Terrill certainly doesn't really believe all this stuff does he. I believe he's in it for the Big Buck. And the Amish are only to willing to go along with him not realizing just what he really is. Amish are such modest and trusting people, others should never take advantage of them. I have many Amish neighbors. They are very nice people."
1,Horribly BORING,"The book is a meer thin paperback that took me months to read and I didn't even get to finish it I was so bored to tears.Jim Fisher repeated himself over and over in every chapter. One was like reading the other. I read about 5 books a month, this was the most boring book ever in my life to read. Don't waste your money on this book ... if you ""must"" read it try your local library, or buy it through Amazon.com for a buck 75 or less/"
4,Great Jazz,"Cobb's Mob are a very fine band, and do a great job with straight ahead jazz and bop. There are no show stoppers on this CD, but everything is a fine listen and Cobb doesn't showboat at all unlike, say Max Roach. My sole complaint with this CD is that I would have like a couple live tracks, for another ten minutes or so. Highly recommended!"
3,A good RPG for younger kids.,"Guardian's Crusade doesn't have a very compelling plotline and isn't very challenging, but it's very bright and cute. If you are looking for a way to get your 6 year old little sibling interested in RPGs, maybe you'd get this game for him or her. If you're a seasoned RPG fan, however, you'll probably end up forgetting it."
2,Good game if you are under 9 years old!,"This game is an RPG but not for adults. If you are a hard core RPG fan then stay away from this title. If you are a hard core RPG fan with young kids and you want to show them what it is all about, then this is the game for you! If you are a newbie to RPG's this game would be a good starter game to familiarize yourself with them. Predictable, repetitive, and boring is all I can say."
5,This E really is for Everyone.,"I've had a hard time finding any truly clean role playing games at all for my son on psx. Even some of the cute cartoony looking ones rated E for Everyone(6&up)like Threads of Fate have adult language at least. I mean I live in the real world, but let's allow kids to play some kid's games sometimes. Guardian's Crusade is huge fun, it is easy enough for the little guy, and it's got to be the cleanest rpg for psx or ps one in terms of content. I got one as fast as I could, since Amazon was the only place I could find it. Meanwhile maybe it's time for a gamecube..."
4,"Very, very solid game.","Gaurdian's Crusade is an overlooked title. I enjoyed this game from start to finish very much. The battle system is simplistic, you attack, you can use little toys in battle that are basically your summons. You can ride various creatures on the field map to get to places faster.One of the best parts about this game is that it is very large. I love an rpg that has towns, and lots of them. Gaurdians Crusade has a lot of towns and you are free to explore every building in every town as you please. The only thing about this game that isn't perfect is the graphics, the environments look a bit blocky and the faces are unfinished but graphics have never been the sole reason for a games greatness. Gaurdians Crusade gets a 4/5, 8/10 in my book."
1,$ 28.99 for this??,"When I first reviewed this product, I entitled it ""39.99 for this??"" OK- They lowered the price to $28.99. That's still too high!!The following is the original review in its entirety:The case holds the iPod snugly, so you can run, bike, etc without worrying about it slipping out of the case. After I opened the packaging, and saw the goods, I was shocked at the price. I guess they feel the higher price is justified because it has an Apple logo on the internal tag. The price point on this should be about $11.99. Not worth the money."
2,Not what you think...,"This case was a huge disappointment when I opened it. It's very plain and certainly nothing special. You can't interact with your iPod while it's in this case, it's merely a covering and cheap one at that. The only thing this MIGHT be ok for is dust protection while it's not in use. If you're looking for great protection for your 3G, 4G or Photo iPods, take a look at RadTech's Cocoon. www.radtech.us/Products/iPodAccessories.aspxIt's $40 and comes with a clear protective skin that straps into the hard shell cocoon. There's a place to keep your earbuds and you have access to the click wheel. It also comes with a neck lanyard and belt clip, which is great for those of us who have a hard time keeping up with stuff unless it's attached to our body. It's most definitely worth the few extra bucks. You DO get what you pay for."
2,Expensive and inconvenient,"This is not a bad carrying case. Its clip works fine, and it holds the 20GB, fourth generation iPod tight. But for the price, one should be able to access the click wheel!The click wheel is arguably the best thing about the new generation of iPods. It's a shame that Apple didn't design a carrying case that allows a person to use it while carrying the iPod. I've resorted to carrying my iPod in my pocket until someone comes along with a case that allows me to change songs and adjust the volume while carrying the iPod with me."
1,This clip caused my iPod to fall into a toilet!!,"It's true. The first time I took my iPod 60 Gig out on my belt, I was at a restaurant and used the bathroom. As I unzipped my pants, the Carrying Case -- with my iPod in it came right off my jeans and fell into the toilet. Apple should be ashamed of themselves for making this thing. The design of the clip can not hold the weight of the iPod. And, like another one on this site said, yes, it does scratch the silver back and screen portion of your iPod. Apple executives have been known for their innovative design -- however this is not one of them. Instead, XtremeMac makes a plastic belt clip device that does not scratch your iPod in any way and stays on your pants no matter what."
2,Look at the Belkin Leather Flip Case for iPod,"instead of high-quality Schoeller ""woven nylon"" overpriced because its an official APPLE product take a look at thisBelkin Leather Flip Case for iPodhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000ULGP8/103-7100148-9677456?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v;=glance&n;=172282currently on sale for fourteen dollarsin this picture you can see that the front of the case covers the click wheel just like the Apple case does.I personally like that because I need tough protection and just carry the ipod in its case in a bag or purse and its safe with a tough case like this."
1,severe waste of money,"I love my ipod but with this carry case, I cannot interact with it. You have no control of anything aside from the hold switch. It feels too much like a marketing gimmick to get you to buy the inline remote earphones, as this is the only way to regain control. I sent it back 5 minutes after opening it. The monster isport case is another option which allows access to the front but the clip is very loose and the case too large. My 40GB click wheel ipod absolutely swims in it, nearly falling out. Still searching in desperation though you can quite easily control the click wheel through the material of a pocket. Perhaps still the best for this very fragile and slippery bit of kit."
3,Handy useful,"Very useful, nice and good product, not what i was thinking of....you can't manage de ipod when its in to it. Anyway i can say that is a good producto."
5,A damn good album,"This is the best Fairport album I've ever heard. (Well, I haven't heard them all.) The story about John ""Babbacombe"" Lee is a really fascinating by itself, but when Fairport make an album about it, it just gets great. Most of the songs were made by Fairport, and Dave Swarbrick did most of the job. His voice is fantastic, and the fiddle playing isn't any worse. The instrumental tune on this album isn't very typical for Fairport, but it suits very well in the story context. The last song (Hanging song) is maybe the best song done by this Fairport lineup (Swarb, Nicol, Pegg and Mattacks), very dramatic and with a great fiddle solo. Don't miss this album!"
3,"Interesting, but not musically satisfying","This is an interesting collection from a historical point of view, however there is very little music really worth listening to."
4,Sublime Dream,"While I have to admit that the narrative is probably a little too loose for many readers, I thought this novel was incredibly beautiful. The imagery is crisp and powerful in a way that is only possible with a story that seems to have its origins in the surrealism of the subconscious. A great book and its imperfections only add to its charm."
2,Tedious Fantasy,"While, yes, the use of language was quite good, the fantastical plot left me cold and unconnected to the characters, so much so that I left this book at page 90, tired by the effort."
3,"Nice concept, expensive ingredients","This book presents many ideas of how to make home made cosmetics. It's thorough, with recipes for hair shampoos and feet scrubs, and everything in the middle. The pictures of the girls are beautiful and even empowering. BUT... most of the recipes require ingredients that are relatively expensive and somewhat difficult to find (borax, glycerin, vitamin E, special oils, essential oils, etc.). You'd have to spend a lot of money to make all the recipes in the book (or even a few of them)."
1,Save your money and your time. Read something decent instead,"I took this back to the bookstore to get my money back. I've never found a book so bad that I demanded a refund for it before. My next demand will be compensation for the time that I wasted trying to read this insanely awful book. The stories are pointless, the characters ugly, and the themes even uglier. Unless stories about twenty dollar hookers and feces get you off, pass on this book. Even being set in Tucson can't redeem it. There are too many good books in the world to waste time on this literary [flop.]"
1,The Graves,"I want back the hour and a half of my life that they wasted watching this. I was, however, disappointed to find that I could not give it 0 stars. Awful is not really adequate to describe this movie. The only good thing I can say about it is, at least the female characters were not totally helpless. Aside from that. . . the Arizona scenery was nice? The acting was poor. The stupid storyline was definitely lacking. It was convoluted and contrived. There was really no suspense or tension, kind of necessary in a horror movie.Mostly though, the theme of ""crazy, evil religious people"" killing people is kind of offensive and a really tired and ineffective plot device."
2,The Graves,"Meg and Abby Graves head out on one last adventure before they go their separate ways after finishing school, but their road trip brings them to a haunted mining town that houses evil spirits from the past. The girls must gather their courage and arm themselves if they hope to escape Skull City alive! THE GRAVES is a weak Slasher hybrid that combines elements of a Western ghost tale. Brian Pulido's feature debut is completely devoid of character development and is filled with meaningless dialog, making it impossible to side with either of his two female protagonists when they do little to garner the audience's support. It is far more foolish than clever, and almost every attempt at humor falls flat. The deaths are equally unimpressive, providing mild amounts of blood, but very little gore. Even the addition of genre favorites Tony Todd and Bill Moseley can't help to save this failing film.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
1,"Just an aweful, aweful movie...","What's to say really, this movie was the PITS... yeah I said it, the PITS! When I saw that Tony Todd and Bill Mosely were in it I thought it could have potential, but than I remembered that besides Texas Chainsaw and Rob Zombie's movies, Bill Mosely has been in nothing but the cheesiest of cheese, and he has outdone himself with ""The Graves"", which is easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This movie is so bad that after going my entre Amazon lifetime without having written a review, it has forced my hand... I felt it was my duty to let the people know of this abomination in movie making. If you have any self respect, you will stay far away from this movie."
1,The Graves,I've seen this movie before & I didn't like it. I should've paid better attention to the synopsis or they should be written with a little more detail. This still doesn't negate the fact that this movie is a snoozer. The acting is horrible & I'm sure you can find better things on which to spend your hard earned money.
4,Great Release!,"I love everything about this cd, I really do. It has very strong songs throughout and the production is very good as well. If I have one beef about this cd is that the vocals can be a little hair metal sounding at times. However other than that it rocks!Check it out!"
3,Would not purchase again...,"I like Aveda products and had tried this one at a hotel before I purchased and thought I would like to try again. I like the smell and it conditions okay...but I feel like I have to use a lot to get the tangles out like you expect a conditioner to do. I downgraded this to use for shaving my legs with after awhile because I can get a better conditioning product from some other (and cheaper) products. On the up-side, this bottle is huge and if you like it, then it should last you a long time."
3,aveda conditioner,"This product smells great! I have very thin, fine hair and with this conditioner I still have to use a spray in detangler in order to brush it. Shipped to me very quickly which was great."
5,Wonderful Product,We used this at a resort in California. I was glad to find it on Amazon. It's very refreshing with the rosemary and mint. Very nice to pamper oneself. :) Recommended!
3,Old school,"The copyright on the book says 2005 but the it has the feel of a much older book with its layout, old-looking drawings and pictures, and lack of color. It reminded me of a military training manual - not something that they made to appeal to consumers. For me, any book that doesn't have nice color pictures (especially wiring pictures), just isn't acceptable. Throw in some old black and white pictures of a 1950's power plant and you've got a book that just feels drab. I'm sure alot of the info in the book is useful but I would definitely look at other options instead of this book."
1,Will not download,I just received this software 2 hours ago. I have been trying to download it ever since.1. Does it not say for Windows XP?2. It comes with a little piece of paper so I thought it must be easy to download.3. It does not. Trying to find troubleshooting help is very difficult. Does not give you a phone number to help.If you want to spend your time figuring out what to do with software..get it.If not get something else.
1,"""translation programs"" NEVER translate accurately","I want to use this occasion to warn people not to fall for so called ""translation programs"". They all produce gibberish, and you can get that for free on the internet, e.g. from Babelfish. So don't waste your money on this."
4,Cool Game,OKay let me just say this game is not the reatest it has 5 corses and vigalante 8 secone offense has 50 and it is only 2 dollasr more. this game is fun but if you want someting that takes more than 5 minutes to beat get the second offense
5,Far out!,"First car combat game on Nintendo 64, ""Vigilante 8"" makes you feel like your in 1979's ""Mad Max"" because all of the machine guns and car bashing action. There are 13 characters, but some are hidden, which you can unlock by completing quests with non hidden characters. The levels are creative and dazzling,like the frontier town which makes you feel like you're in a western movie. The game is a little too easy, but all in all,it's a great game."
5,GREAT TRANSACTION,"GREAT GAME! EXACTLY WHAT I ORDERED...GOOD PRICE GREAT CONDITION, FAST SHIPMENT, HOPE TO DO BUSINESS AGAIN!"
3,a early attempt at twisted metal,theres a bunch of cars and trucks chasing eachother all over creation and endlessly blasting the crap out of eachother.thats really about it.using the rapid fire cheat will make youre gameplay far more enjoyable.thres really not much else to tell.i like the dune buggy.his special weopon is a gatling type gun.it always points where the bad guy is so you dont have to chase the punks down.
2,You'd rather rent the game instead (trust me I did),I beat the game in 5 days so don't waste your bucks on something you are going to play for only 10 at most days. Rent the game
1,Failed Prophecy,"This is one of the Watchtower's books that just about predicted the end of the world, Armageddon, would occur in the fall of 1975. Most Jehovah's Witnesses deny this today. Freddy Franz wrote it. He is most famous as the 'oracle' of the Jehovah's Witnesses, going back to the good old days when Judge Rutherford was the president of the Watchtower Society. Freddy's teachings are responsible for the ""no blood, let me die"" doctrine that has killed so many innocent JWs."
5,Give me an A!,This is a great decal to show team support. The magnet is strong enough for the wind not toBlow it of the vehicles.
4,Crisp and Clean Bach,"Sebestyen's rendering of Bach is very clean and precise, something which is very important in contrapuntal compositions. However, I must level one critique against the performance on this CD. It seems a bit too ""laid-back"" and carefree at times. In my humble opinion, I wish he would have a bit more passion and nuance in dynamics and punctuation. Nevertheless, his crisp style does do much to show the beauty of Bach's work. A further positive note is the inclusion of Minuet in G Minor, BWV Anh. 115, a simple, yet rich, Minuet that I have had some difficulty finding next to its Major counterpart. Overall, at its low price, I must thoroughly suggest this collection because it is executed well, albeit a bit dispassionate."
5,very helpful,After reading this book I've found a comprehensive approach used to discuss the real scenarios through we got new and innovatives ways to analyse the business. I strongly recommend this to everyone who interests to promote their business and wants to develop a diverse strategies helping to become competitive.
5,awesome tent!,"This tent rocks. There was no rain where I was, however we were on the beach and it held up perfect. The rain fly fits great. There was 2 of us and with no instructions (didn't find them until it was up) it took us about 15 minutes to put it up. Another 5 on the rain fly and done. Tons of room. Window are big, it's almost a screen room with everything open. Zippers are great. The one big thing is the zippers. The awning is a bit quirky, but it did do it's job. Over all we had 2 queen bed and 4 people in the tent and there was still a ton of room. I have nothing bad to say about this tent."
4,Copper Canyon 1512 Family Tent,"Tent is quite roomy and has lots of nice features. Have not taken it to the woods yet, but set up and take down is easy (I did it alone)and the instructions are reasonably clear. Mine arrived with two holes in the tent side, apparently due to packing at the factory (appeared to be made by the tent poles inserted in the carrying bag). Otherwise, I'm happy with my choice. I do a lot of traditional archery outings and normally have a couple of people with me. This tent should work nicely...particularly like the design with straight walls which contriubutes to available space and feeling of spaciousness. No delusions about this being a four seasons tent, but it appears sturdy enough to hold up to the Spring - Fall outings for which I will use it."
2,Disappointed,Upon setting up the tent the first time I discovered a small hole in the floor and another in the back wall of the tent. If you folded the tent the holes would line up. I also noted that the screen roof had a run in it. (like a nylon sock).Water leaked in the large back panel where ever a tab was sewn in. These seams were taped. None of the other side leaked.Even though the warranty states Eureka would repair or replace the tent Support stated they had nothing to replace it with.It will also take 6 to 8 weeks to repair. My camping came to a stop. I had to pay to ship it back.
4,Nice Tent,"After 20 years of use, my old tent had seen better days, so I started reading reviews and researching tents. I decided to purchase the Eureka! Copper Canyon 1512 tent. I really like this tent. It is very roomy (plenty of space for 4 cots and gear), easy to set up (20 minutes the first time, you need at least 2 people), seems well build and sturdy (haven't experienced any bad weather in it yet), good ventilation (huge windows). I only have two negatives, #1 The floor material seems a little thin for my liking (sure hope it doesn't rip) and #2 I wish Eureka! had used a different color material for the floor (I think the light color material will show the dirt)."
5,The most awesome tent ever!,"We set this tent up for a practice run on a windy day in the park and it was surprisingly fast and easy. Out first time actually camping was fabulous. The tent is so roomy and the best part is my very tall husband can stand up and even walk around inside.5/09- We still love this tent. It is so easy to set up, we did it in 10 minutes! The tent held up even in the very windy desert with the guy lines. It was the only time we've ever had to use them."
4,Big and roomy,"I purchased this tent to replace our smaller tent that we have out grown. If you have put up a medium size tent in the past this one will not give you any trouble. I put it up and took it down myself on a breezy day without any issue. The fly may require a second person to put up.Impressions: Big, easy install, plenty of windows. Flimsy room divider that is hung not zipped in place. The floor seems pretty light weight. No water came in, but it seemed like it might not wear well with non grassy surfaces.In the end we liked the room the tent provided and the relatively ease of putting up/taking down (compared to other tents of that size).Would recommend to others, just get a tarp to put under the tent to protect the floor surface from scratches/punctures."
5,Best family camping tent yet!,"I have been tent camping for 40 years and I thought the rip stop nylon and shock cord dome tents were the end all, be all for tent camping but I hated the dome wherein you really could only stand in the center. This tent utilizes the best of both worlds, rigid poles for vertical walls and the shock cord poles for the roof support giving you a very usable floor to ceiling, true to sixe 15x12 tent. I have been using this tent for 3 years. Like the other reviewers said, the tent poles are cheap but who uses them, I have always bought the 3/8 aluminum steaks and use them for tents, Ez-ups, tarps, dog lead hold down, etc. The floor cover is highly recommended. I have not used a cover and my floor shows it, after I get done with this review I am going to try and find one on-line.Bottom-line, it's the best family tent I have ever used, and the best designed tent I have ever seen."
1,Worst Tent Ever Owned,"This was our third tent owned. We loved the roominess (able to fit king size air mattress, two children's cots and two full size dog beds, plus a camping potty) and the ability to put up awning.I'll start with the awning. Very easy to install, but unsteady during winds. The first rain shower this tent took in 90 gallons of water. Thankfully, we were camping on our own property! Took hours using our 10 gallon wet-dry vac to get out the water. We put the tent in our barn to dry out the rest of the way, and since we didn't stake it down the poor thing fell over putting a good size gash in it's rainfly. No tears shed, but it will be missed.Purchased a smaller Coleman Instant tent & absolutely love it!!!! In one fall weekend camped at two cub scout family campouts and able to put this tent up with my 10 y/o son and I. Haven't experienced rain with this one yet."
5,Experience shows.,"A rewarding introduction to this unique and interesting discipline. Using working examples, related mathematics, and subject history, Dr. Hershey illustrates important aspects of effective crypto system design. Part of the how-to is to understand how-not-to and the text uncovers some subtle flaws in crypto design and associated consequences. Connections to other areas in communications engineering and applied number theory make the book valuable for a broad audience.The presentation is insightful, mature, innovative, and enjoyable. Certainly recommended."
5,Excellent Book!,"I took the author's graduate course on cryptography while this book was still in draft form. The material addresses the difficult and essential foundations of cryptography in a way that is accessible to people with a wide variety of backgrounds. Anyone interested in cryptography, from the computer enthusiast to the number theorist will enjoy and gain insight from this book."
2,Poor style,"The two authors did not seem to collaborate very much while writing this book for there are many instances in which their two different styles become very obvious. One of the major points which I did not like is that they swith between ""tsar"" and ""czar."" The book way very choppy and hardly followed any chronological order. One thing that I did find amazingly helpful was the family tree in the front (many a time I had to use it to figure out who they were talking about because sometimes they would use nichnames and other times they wouldn't). Over all I thought that it was a very poorly written book. I love the story of the Romanovs, and this book did it no justice."
2,A bit slanted,"I have to say that of all the books I've read on the Romanovs, this one just plain made me angry because it's not very impartial. I was under the impression that a historian would want to be as impartial & objective as possible in order to demonstrate ""the truth."" In this case, the author cakes the text with so much subjectivity, I couldn't even finish it. I'm as open as the next person when it comes to putting forth new ideas, but the book doesn't even do that. For anyone who's read anything about the dynasty, the author seems to have deliberately forgotten about anything else that's been written about it - including historical files and information already well known in history. His opinion is so prominent that it became more annoying the more I read. I got the distinct impression he was actually ""siding"" w/ particular family members - rather than looking from the outside in. NOT a good read for people who love the rich history of the Romanovs."
5,"O Romanov, Romanov, Wherefor Art Thou, Romanov?","This is a lively, well-written and informative book on a subject not really well-covered in other works on the last days of the Russian Empire. Occasionally, the plethora of patronymics becomes confusing, but the authors have kindly listed everyone with family connections on a chart in the front. That's of great help to the reader. Anyone interested in early twentieth century Imperial Russian history will appreciate this book very much."
4,"Intelligent, enjoyable, and historically accura","Interesting and thorough analysis of the final Romanovs, both those in power and those who pretend to be. Author writes well and content is fluent and easy to follow. Does good job of explaining relationships between various branches of Romanov family tree and petty rivalries that added to the chaos and lack of leadership in early 20th century Russia."
2,A Poor Book,"Very little of this book actually deals with the flight of the Romanovs. The first one doesn't leave Russia until page 179 and most of the rest of the book deals with various Romanovs in exile after they fled. Absolutely trivial, useless anecdotes are abundant. It was impossible to keep all the players straight, partly because everyone had a nickname in addition to his/her given name. It would have been better to describe each branch of the family separately, rather than discussing everyone at once."
4,Interesting Perspective,"There are not many books about the majority of the Romanov clan. This one is good in the respect that it tells the story of many of the little known members. I had to question the research behind the Grand Duke and Duchess Kyril, however. Perry and Pleshakov state that the Grand Duchess Kyril(""Ducky"") was a Angliphobe. They also point that she was to force behind her husband's claims to the Russian throne in the 1920's and 30's. There is too much evendience to the contrary, namely resources that have been used in biographies on Ducky and her sister Queen Marie of Romania. They point to how she was very proud to be a Princess of Great Britain, which was more important in the end than being a pretender to a non-existant throne. She was only supporting her husband, not his cause. I wish there had been more on Nicholas II's brother Michael; the info on his sister Olga is facinating to read."
1,EX LAX FOR THE EARS,This is Ex-lax for the ears.Every song of the 5 samples sounds like the song before and none sound like something that needs repeating.
4,Everyday Heroes,"I read Daniel's story in reading groups. I personally thought it was one of the best books I have ever read. This story makes you stay on the edge of your seat.Also it will make you appreciate the people you love you and the things you have. It shows the everyday heroes that we have from saving your basketball from the mud or the firefighter that saves your baby sister from your burning apartment. I think we should appreaste all of our everyday heroes like Daniel.He lives in Frankfurt in 1933. Adlof Hitler is becoming the premier government leader and when he says all the good things he is going to do for Germany, he has to blame someone or some people from all the problems they had befog.He blames the Jews. Through all the hard times in the contraction camp Daniel shows determination, courage, and good heartness. He falls in love with a girl named Rosa."
2,"good, but dragged on a little long","Daniels story was a good book, but it dragged on a little bit to long. I liked how the author explained the feelings that the characters had. The way he wrote the book made it seem like you were actually in the moment.The only thing i think he could have changed was that the book went on to long and should have ended a little bit earlier. For example the author went on and on about the concentration camps and when he was in it he didnt have to say everything he did. If he left out some of the details it might have made it a little bit better.m"
5,Daniel trying to escape the Holocaust,I liked this book because the writer made me feel I was in the book.The writer got a message to me that Daniel was determend but also sad because most of his family died.I read this book before we started to read aloud and I couldn't put it down.I think the writer did a very good job.But my favorite part was when Daniel saw Rosa.
5,Daniel wants to live to tell,The book Daniel's Story was about a boy named Daniel and how he and his family survived the tragic horror of the Holocaust. Daniel's goal is to do whatever he can to stay alive so he can live to tell people about the Holocaust.This book is great because it is filled with suspense and lets people learn about the Holocaust.
4,Kyle Gruning's review,Daniel's story really caught my eye on what halocaust book I should read. Daniel's story was a very good book it's descrption is so realistic its like you are there there are alot of hard ships in this story alot of suffering. This story is still a very good bookall in all.
5,My Favorite Book,"Daniel's Story is the MOST wonderful book i have read in my entire life. It combines history, romance, and values wrapped up in an emotional story told by Daniel. I think that this is an excellent book for children and adults everywhere."
3,Not among her better works,"Daniel's Story is not among Carol Matas' better works. It lacked character development, depth, ans suspense. For a better read, try Lisa (also published as Lisa's War) or Jesper (also published as Code Name Kris), her first books about young adults during WWII. After these two novels, Daniel's Story was disappointing."
2,Library Binding - Not!,"This was sold as ""library binding."" It is nothing more than a used (yellowing) paperback from Scholastic. I have no problem with the quality of the paperback, but do have a problem with the misrepresentation. I paid ""jacket price"" for a paperback that is used. I would have rather paid full price for new items (as I did with the rest of the order for the same book). I have never felt ""duped"" until today."
4,Touching but not detailed.,THe book was very touching but it was not complete. I finished it and thought were is the rest of the book. It wasn't very thouroughly done. If you want very good reading try something else. If you're looking for factual reading and short story reading this is just the book for you. This book is also a good class room book. So if you area teacher and want a book about a Jew who was tortured by the Germans during World War 2 this would be a good book for you. All in all this book should get a 4 star rating!
5,I have one problem,i think this anthology is great. i used it in class and was very insightful. my only problem is that the thematic organization of material makes it hard to navigate
2,Not worth the price,"I used this anthology one time and it will be the last. I just could not justify the price ($62) to my students. Unfortunately, the quality of the book itself was not good; pages came off easily, and there were several errors throughout the book. I also came to regret this book's narrow historical scope; it's important to give students a broader spectrum of the literature's development, especially since most don't even realize Latinas/os have been producing literature in America since the 16th century. Moreover, there are much more exciting, significant Latino writers in the contemporary scene completely neglected by this anthology."
1,Don't buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"It is only 15 minutes long!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Plus, there is only about 5 minutes of aikido, and not that good at that.After I saw the video I returned it immediately.daniel"
1,Legs fell off - Customer Service is great though,"Made it a year but only barely... for the last couple months of use we were keeping a leg on the kitchen window sill and carefully placing it when we steamed our veggies. When the second (of three) legs gave up, so did we.UPDATE: Contacted customer service through their website and they were prompt in responding. They didn't hesitate in shipping me a new steamer basket. I really do hope this one lasts longer! May update my rating after using the replacement for some time."
1,JUNK....DON'T PURCHASE,I had to throw this out after the FIRST use. It is cheaply made and falls apart VERY easily. Pure JUNK.
1,Flimsy and cheap,"When my old steamer, which I have had for years, lost a leg, I decided to buy this one. When I took it out of the box, I could see that the metal is much thinner and more flimsy than my older steamer. The ""ring"" is a piece of wire which is not even soldered together. I poked my finger on the rough ends of the ring when I took it out of the box. One of the leaves already seems loose. It is made in China,like so many of the shoddy clothes and household goods on the market. I've had enough of shoddy Chinese junk; I am returning this and getting my husband to fix my old one."
1,Shoddy product,"Do not waste your time with this steamer. I've had it for less than a month, and it has been used maybe 5 times, and two of the leaves already fell off of it. It was obvious when I took it out of the box that it was a flimsy, badly made product, but for the price I thought that if it lasted me a year, it would serve its purpose. I was 11 months shy of that goal."
4,Does what I want,"I got this to steam green leafy veggies. It does the trick. I read some reviews about it being flimsy, but for my purposes, it works like a charm. Pop this in one of my big pots and it saves me $$$$ on a big steamer."
1,Pull tab broken right out of the box,"The concept is right, but the construction is flimsy. The pull tab, which you would use to lift the steamer out of a pot, would not stay attached. I'd send this back if it weren't such a hassle. Instead, I'll just use a hot pad to lift the steamer out of the pot."
1,"Another example of Chinese ""quality""",Growing up we always had a product like this around the house. We decided to buy one and chose this model. What a mistake. I used this about three times before it rendered itself useless.I read another review about the leaves being unsecured. Absolutely true. I first noticed it when washing the basket by hand. Just cleaning it makes the leaves fall off. Ridiculous.This is a steamer basket by design. The only thing close to that is the fact that this product is a steaming pile of Chinese crap.
