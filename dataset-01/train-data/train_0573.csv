1,Couldn't get past chapter 3,"I deleted this from my kindle after chapter 3! The description sounds great but it's really a religious proselitizing book. i hate to be hit over the head about jesus, christianity, and so forth. And, when the character is either thinking or talking about church, religion, god and so forth it's in italics. As if I can't get it or something! I found it pedantic, obvious and dull. I don't mind religious references or characters, but this one is way over the top!"
2,"Started well, ended...just meh.","I really enjoyed the first 3 chapters of this book, and felt empathy with the sweet, ""invisible"" protagonist Ivy. However, the strong start quickly faded as the storyline seemed to overwhelm the author a bit. The story really began to wander, wavering between overwrought detail in some areas and the skimming only of the surface of others. I found myself feeling very little for the rest of the characters in the story and, by the end, nothing at all even for the main character herself who had become a bit of a cartoon. I didn't notice the religious references all that much in the beginning, but by the end various comments seemed to be thrown in just to hit a 'God comment quota' regardless if they moved the story forward or not and it became disjointed. I'm not sure if all of those loose storyline ends were meant to leave the door open for the sequel, but it really felt unfinished to me. With a really good editor and a rewrite, this could be a great book."
1,"Bad writing, plot, dialogue, but cute idea","As a grandmother who is clever, fun and witty I had hoped to fing a fun series about a peer.Not..didn't happen here.This could have been so much more than the internal and constant religious self talk that it is....honestly, even we mature people have more intelligence than depicted with Ivy.So sad.......sigh.....well at least it was free.Still I can't help but be awfully disappointed in what first sounded like a great idea for interested boomers."
2,Too much religious reference,"If you are a fundamentalist Christian that likes murder mysteries, this book is for you. But, after establishing that the heroine is a Christian, the references to God and church have no bearing to the story at all. The story line is good and the character is entertaining but the constant religious references are distracting."
4,Entertaining Mystery,"It was a bit difficult to get into this book but I'm glad I hung in there. I enjoyed the story and I felt the religious ora throughout the book added to the story line. Just as I enjoy books with all religions, this did not offend me in the least. I felt it gave Ivy another facet in her life and made her like so many Christians who live what they teach. By the end of the book, I felt I knew her well. I also think there are lots of people out there who do feel invisible. That part of this entertaining mystery will stay with me."
4,Enjoyable,An enjoyable read. Was refreshing to read a book where the author tries to show how our lives can be better if we accept God and his teachings into our lives.
4,Entertaining and CLEAN,Very entertaining. Good for light reading. So nice to have a well-written book without garbage :-) Kept me interested. You feel like you know and like the quirky main character.
4,invisible(ivy malone mysery sries 1,"it is easy to read and i enjoyed it very much,i have just started reading books because i just bought a kindle fire."
4,invisible,A cute series that is light but entertaining. A really good series to read when you want to relax and enjoy yourself
3,Go the Older Generation,"A very sweet, sometimes funny book. You can't help but like the characters. However, it did show a little of the sadness and loneliness of old age."
3,LOLs rule,Ivy is a great character! I enjoyed reading this mystery. The characters make up an interesting family unit. There is a lot of religion as the heroine relays upon her faith for many decisions. Some will find her refreshing. For me this book was not a quick read but I am glad that I finished it and would definitely pick up the next one in the series.
4,Invisible Ivy,Enjoyed this book very much. It was a quick read and held my interest. Was happy to see it was the first in a series and I'm looking forward to reading the next one.
5,"great, silly, and lots of truth!",I'm a young christian and I loved this book Ivy is so funny but so snoopy and a great role modle on how to live a good life I would recamend this book to people with a fun and silly persinalety!
1,Couldn't finish,"Well I tried but I couldn't get past page 53. You might find it a better read, but would suggest that you get a sample of it before you buy."
4,Invisible (ivy Malone Mystery Series #1),"Personally, I enjoyed the book. Ivy Malone, a Senior Citizen, is a most delightful main character. Being 'older' she realizes that people don't seem to 'see' her anymore. She uses this invisible status to help solve the mysterious murder of a young lady living in the basement apartment of her closest friend. In pursuit of justice for the murder victim, she puts herself in precarious predicaments time and time again. I felt myself pulled into Ivy Malone's gutsy exploits finding it a quite riveting read. Moreover, it was refreshing to read a story in which the main character was upfront about being a Christian. The author doesn't hit you over the head with it, but the fact that Ivy Malone trusts God in her life is a thread woven throughout the book. I give this book a resounding 'Yes!'"
4,quick clean read,"This is a nice quick read that would be good for even a fairly young reader. Very sweet, very clean. It's a great book to be able to pick up and read for a few minutes in between appointments and errands. A book you can lend to your 13 year old or your aging mother-in-law and be confident that they will enjoy it and you won't be embarrased by any passages in the book that would be ""steamy.""I liked it well enough that I would pick up another in the series."
5,Invisible A Hoot,Ivy Malone mysteries are new to me and Invisible was a hoot particularly due to the references made relative to age and experiences as I am in the same age bracket. Thank you!
2,A passable mystery with more Jesus than substance,"This was a cute, easy to read mystery. Nothing challenging, but I didn't expect that considering it was a freebee. Unfortunately it was ruined by not only the amount of religion in it, but the fact that the heavy handed proselytizing had nothing to do with the plot line what so ever. A little over half way through it got tough to put up with and I only finished because I'd already invested my time in the beginning. Won't be reading this author again.Very disappointed and I feel like the author deliberately misleads the reader in the books description. Wish Amazon had a requirement to disclose this type of religious tract hidden in a novel."
3,Fun little read.,"A bit slow moving in the beginning but it warms up and becomes intriguing, and ends with a promise of more to come. She illustrates a sad phenomonim unique to the American culture, the invisibility of our elders, and gives it a ""beneficial"" spin. I want to read more of her books."
2,Good Christian Old Lady,"The mystery was alright, a bit boring though and was probably only 30-35% of the book.The rest was about being christian, being an old lady..."
4,Ivy hooked me!,"The first chapter was a bit slow, and I didn't think I'd finish it. But a friend had read further along, and encourage me to continue. One more chapter later, and I was hooked.I enjoy this spunky, God-fearing woman, and her decisiveness when she's in between the ""rock and a hard place"" (and she finds herself there quite regularly!) I enjoyed the religious aspects of the book and her self-deprecating humor, as she stumbles across clues and suspects. I'll make Lorena McCourtney a regular on my kindle."
4,"Her ""invisibility"" is real","Invisible (Ivy Malone Mystery Series #1) Lorena McCourtneyI enjoyed reading the book. It wasn't the best novel I've ever read, but I think it rates 4 stars. For the most part this is a non violent, rather slow paced detective mystery. The references to religion were not distracting to me, but I don't think they added anything to the plot. I don't think I'm giving away any vital information by saying that the title refers to the fact that the detective is a senor citizen. That fact makes her invisible ( or hardly ever noticed) . Being a senior citizen myself, I know what the author is talking about. When the detective realizes her ""invisibility"" she takes full advantage of it, which causes interesting situations to develop."
4,Ivy Malone Strikes Again !,"Ivy Malone doesn't just sit at home knitting like most ladies her age, although there are many who wish she would. When the young and beautiful next door neighbor girl disappears, Ivy has to stick her nose into the situation as usual. She almost gets herself killed and her house burned down as she gets too close to figuring out where she has gone."
4,ms cool,I really liked the book but I absolutely hate it that you make me write a min of words on this.
3,After Reading Payne & Misery I was Hooked on the theme...,"After Reading Payne & Misery I was hooked on the theme of the older, snoopy woman who just couldn't seem to avoid trouble. While I enjoyed Invisible, I still felt that the story left a little to be desired. Overall, I read the entire book and was amused at times. I missed the easy reading from Catherine Leggitt, so I gave this a 3-stars.If you liked this book, I highly recommend you check outPayne & Misery (A Christine Sterling Mystery), and evenThe Dunn Deal (A Christine Sterling Mystery)when it's released. I know I am waiting for the sequel from now on!"
4,A light mystery and fun read...,"I am and have never been a fan of mysteries, but I read this one in 2 sittings. I really liked the characters - McCourtney did a great job of character development - and the plot wasn't too over-the-top."
2,Not bad for free,The writing is a little weak. The storyline itself isn't bad. I wanted to get to the end of the mystery but I wouldn't recommend this to a friend if it wasn't a free book.
4,Delightful,"A charming story of a nosy LOL (little old lady) who is funny, adventuresome, kind and thoughtful. The mystery was intriguing and had enough twists to keep my interest. The only thing I didn't care for was a bit too much ""Christian witnessing"" which was not advertised as being part of the book...otherwise, an excellent read."
4,Just Plain Fun,"A delight to read on my Kindle. The Ivy Malone series are fun, heartwarming and uplifting. Just beginning ""Stranded"" (4th in series) and finding myself wishing there was a 5th."
4,"Light, funny and an easy read. I'm moving on to her next book.","The reviews drew me in. Well, the reviews and the fact it was free. Ivy's character is so true to life. This story flows well and completely drew me into her life. If you enjoy light hearted fun this is the book for you. And, yes there are a few Christian references but they did not monopolize the story. If you find yourself offended by a reference to God then perhaps you should stay away but I believe most individuals would enjoy this story."
3,good introduction to ebooks for kindle,"An interesting book, my first ever ebook , did think it would have been a little longer, a good light read, quite enjoyable. would have liked a blurb at the start to give an indication as to the characters and storyline - I guess I like to read the blurbs before I read the book as I find it gives me a basic intro as to who is who within the book."
4,liked this,a good christian story. we need more clean honest mysteries. the author is aware of the local area and i like the settings
4,Invisible (Ivy Malone Mystery Series #1),I have to say this book took me by surprise. I found it very clean and enjoyable. It's hard to find a book that doesn't have cursing and intimate details in it and still be a good mystery.
3,Invisible,Quick read and a very good mystery. Not my favorite book but definitely a fun book with no bad language.
4,Good story!,I am presently enjoying the book but have not yet finished it. The story line is intriguing and I am looking forward to finishing it and reading more of Ms. McCourtneys stories.
4,Lorena McCourtney Rocks,"I read a lot and am always looking for fun novels and mysteries - I came across ""Invisible"" in the Kindle free books website and took a chance. Her book was so much fun to read and I love the fact that the main character, Ivy Malone, is gray-haired and invisible to most people (I know the feeling, I'm 72 and love it) but it can come in handy at times as is shown in this book. I hithly recommend it to anyone who enjoys light mysteries."
5,"A WONDERFUL, EASY READ!","I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Ivy Malone is refreshing in the way she thinks and I loved the way her mind works. I am a ""Senior"" myself and have also felt that some people just don't even see me on occasion, so I found it easy to relate to her invisibility. I told my husband about this book and he downloaded it, too. I can hardly wait for him to start reading it so I can hear his laughter in the funny parts."
2,Hard to get through,This was the first book I've read from this author and honestly I had a hard time finishing it. The things that Ivy does in the book are just not believable. I received the ebook for free during a promotion and won't be re-reading it.
2,So So,"All I can say is, I read through this book! It wasn't bad, and I rather enjoyed reading about an ""older"" sleuth. It was ""OK""!"
3,Invisible (Ivy Malone Mystery Series #1),"The author held the reader's interest in plot design and character development. The story does require a suspension of disbelief to some degree based on the heroine's age and physical ability. Yet, it is a good beach or airplane read."
4,Good read,It was a good clean read and I enjoyed the christian values and morals. I will def read more from this author.
4,"Fun, quick","This is a Little Old Lady mystery, featuring an amateur detective who lives in a small-to-medium-sized town in central Missouri. The voice in which Invisible seems genuine enough, and the characters are all of the typical Southern/Midwestern type.It's fair to note for those who want to find (or avoid) specifically Evangelical Christian fiction that this is one of those. (I didn't mind it, since I am an Evangelical.) Unlike the last Christian novel I read, the religious aspects seemed organic to the character, not glommed on as decoration.As a writer I found the style lighthearted, breezy even, and this was a good introduction to a a new (to me) series that I hope to hear more of in the future.My non-integral rating is 3.25 stars (rounded up to 4)."
3,"light easy read, mostly fun.",The book was an easy read. What I like to call a beach read because you don't really need to concentrate to get the jist of the plot and whats going on in the book. But it had a fun plot and held my interest. The only dislike was the religious aspect of the book. Our main character is a christian and I felt in that respect the book was a bit preachy. It just didn't feel like natural conversation when it fell into the religious dialog.
2,Too much religion for me.,"I read this one because of all the positive reviews. Although, I thought it was ok it definitely wasn't wowed. As a matter of fact when I looked at how far I'd made it through the book and realized I was only at 30% I was so disappointed.While this book started off good and ended fairly good the entire middle was not that great. In fact it started making me fairly mad. I'm not religious. The middle of the book seemed like that's all they wanted to talk about. How God is always there and will be with you and blah blah blah blah freakin blah. Honestly, it ruined the book for me. I wouldn't have minded an occasional peace be with you and all that but it wasn't like that at all.The best thing about this book was that I thought I had it all figured out. The twist at the end was much better than what I had come up with. Even though it was fairly close to what I thought, it was far enough away that I wouldn't have been able to guess it."
2,A You get nothing for nothing; IIt's a terrible read!,"I usually don't review books, but this Freebie, ""Invisible"" was so poorly written, the plot very weak and unstructured. The characters were uninteresting and the greatest irritant was forcing religious values on the reader. I finished the book only because I wanted to be fair to Ms. McCourtney in the event that the book would improve. It didn't."
2,Invisible (Ivy Malone Mystery Series #1),I have no recollection of reading this particular book. It did not make an impression on me at all if I did.
3,skip the sermons,author is excellent with characters and plot. she spoiled a really excellent book by digressions into sermonizing. won't read another.
1,never read it,"It just appeared on my kindle, I hope I didn't pay for it. Please refund me the cost, I never ordered it."
1,I Wasn't Down With the Writing Style,"Back when I was young and arrogant, I used to enjoy declaring that when I can't get into a book by the 2nd chapter I throw it out the window. Now that I'm less young and less arrogant, I'm not so disposed to do that. Plus since I have a Kindle, I can't really toss the thing out the window. Deleting the book has no drama, but there it is.A lot of people have bemoaned the positive religious flavor of this book, but that doesn't bother me so much. My problem was the tedious writing style. It could be that it was an accurate voice for the protagonist. Since I've never had it in for Miss Marple, I threw my finger on the delete key. (See, it's just not the same -- it almost makes me want to print it out so I can defenestrate it)."
2,only so-so,"The story was cute, albeit a bit obvious, and Ivy is a fun, likeable character, but this book was way too religious. As another poster said, it should be qualified as religious fiction and I didn't like all the preachiness. Had it been without that I would have read another one. But, for free on my Kindle, it was worth it."
2,Way to churchy,"Book started out pretty good, with just a few church references. Then got way to many reference to church and religious. Stopped reading it."
2,Serious Religious bent,"I picked this free book as I enjoy light mysteries. As I am not Christian I did not like the constant atempt to ""enlighten me"".Thanks but no thanks."
1,Never ordered,Again this item was not ordered by me and I did not receive it. I hope that whomever received it loved it.
2,OK Mystery,I got this book as a freebie for my kindle. I found the story just lost it's momentum along the way. By the time of the trial I was just skipping pages to get to the end. The religion was at times unnecessarily heavyhanded.
4,Fun little story,"Very easy to read but had some believable characters. Ivy could be someone you know she is that real. She has some of the same thoughts we all have. The mystery itself isn't the selling point here, but the characters draw you in."
3,Invisible,The book was okay. I didn't like how it ended. I hope the next book goes on from there. Too much religion.
3,good not great,this book was a pretty good read. not what I expected. at times i thought i knew what was going to happen and other times i was totally surprised. worth the free read. not sure if it is worth buying the next book in the series.
4,Held my interest.,"I enjoy mysteries and this one really held my interest. The plot was not predictable, like some. The character was very likeable, although a bit corny at times. Overall, very enjoyable."
4,Invisible( Ivy Malone Mystery Series#1),"I have fallen a little in love with LOL Ivy Malone. She's a true Christian and although at times I felt the story didn't need quite so much piety, the mystery is so good you have to keep reading and Ivy is such a feisty lady you can overlook her sudden lapses into prayer on a regular basis. I couldn't put this book down once I started it and I can't wait to read the next book in the series as the last page leaves you hanging. Anyone who likes a good murder mystery with a lot of action will enjoy this book; and I'm sure Ivy Malone will gain a lot of new fans."
3,Some Parts Were Exciting,"This book was okay for a diversion. You kind of knew who the bad guys were from the start. The concept that little old ladies are invisible is an interesting one. There are some scences that were exciting.I could see this as a made for TV movie. A person like Helen Hayes could play the lead.As a believer the Christianity did not bother me, but I would like to see it better intergrated as part of the story. Besides little old ladies usually go to church.Remember to keep your eyes open. Some little old lady might be watching."
3,Undecided,"I got this book for my Kindle, mainly because it was free. That said, I can't decide if I like it or not.Although it was generally engaging, and somewhat entertaining, I found some of the religious conversations pointless. Also, the ending felt unsatisfactory, an obvious set up for the next book in the series.I doubt if I'll get the others in the series, mainly because Ivy Malone doesn't strike me as the kind of person I'd choose to associate with in real life."
3,"Cute, quick read","Ivy Malone is a cute character who reminds me of my grandmother. Although the story was entertaining, the references to church and religion were a bit overkill at some points in the story."
3,Cute,A pretty decent book. I think it would have been better if two-thirds of the preaching was left out. I think the author could still get her message across and moved the story along better with one-third.
2,"Good writing, but not a good mystery","The story centered around an old woman and her search for the killer of a dead friend's renter. There are many Christian references that get in the way of a good story, bringing down the reading enjoyment. Ivy, the feisty little old lady main character, at one time seems to have little knowledge of investigation and at another time rattles off terms that make her seem like an ex-cop. I will not be reading any sequels."
3,Mixed feelings,"I liked the character and I liked the book. I love the whole concept of a spunky older lady with a solid faith in God solving mysteries. The thing that annoyed me about the book was how at various moments, Ivy was tooooo...preachy. I don't feel like going into specifics.I would be willing to read the 2nd one if it was free as well lol."
3,Captivating story line. Nice seguay into book 2',"A good book, hard to find a stopping place.. . I wanted to keep reading all night long, &usually; did!"
5,Loved it :),"I'm certain I've never read a cuter mystery than this one. I thought Ivy Malone, LOL (little old lady), with her mutant curiosity gene is the funnest sleuth I've ever read about. I don't often share much about what I'm reading with my husband, but he heard something about this book each day I was reading it (I think three days -- I don't get tons of time to read). He finally asked if he should read it and I told him DEFINITELY!!"
1,Slow moving mystery with religious overtones,"This was my first foray into the Ivy Malone series, and I must say I most likely will not try another. While the author had some interesting turns of phrase that I appreciated greatly, I felt that the ""mystery"" was plodding, with too many sections that had an irrelevant religious message that did not move the story forward in the least. The character development felt contrived, having information, and I kept thinking, ""so what?"" I bought this book on Kindle to take on vacation, primarily because it was very inexpensive, but wished I'd saved my money for a mystery with more ""mystery"" and less ""religion."""
3,Good plot but I felt like I was being asked to convert to Christianity,"Like other readers, I enjoyed the plot and the character but I felt like the author was trying to get me to convert to Christianity. 60% of the time, the religious aspect seemed like it was woven into the character but the other 40% felt like the author was up on her soapbox."
3,Would have been better without the religious overtones,"Invisible was a good, but not great book- I thought it had enjoyable characters and decent plot. Honestly I probably would have rated it higher if it wasn't for the sections that detailed Ivy's religious beliefs- it seemed just a bit preachy to me and didn't feel like they belonged. I have no issue with the fact that the character is a faithful, church going woman and that she feels strongly about God's presence in her life, it is just that the sections of the book where she is discussing her beliefs with Dix and with Mac aren't what I was looking for in a mystery novel and I felt that Ivy's convictions could have been better incorporated without disrupting the flow of the story."
1,Leaves you hanging,"I got this one as a freebie, and I'm glad I did. I don't mind Christian books at all, but this one felt more proselytizing than any of the others I've read - and I'm a Christian. The plot was believable up to a point, but then it just got ridiculous. I could put all of that aside if the ending was more than a lead in to the next book. I've read plenty of mystery series, and most of them allow each volume to stand alone. This series is nothing like that. Sure, one of the main mysteries is resolved, but it leaves off with a big cliffhanger. Not fun. I won't be looking any further for Ivy Malone."
1,Boring,"This seemed okay from the preview, but the plot wandered, the characters didn't develop into anything interesting, and I started to wish for the minor characters to kick this obnoxious busybody out of their lives. Didn't finish it."
2,Well I won't read the sequel.,"I give it two stars because the plot is mildly interesting, although predictable. Otherwise it would be one star. The heroine Ivy is not believable. The other characters are generally two dimensional, no depth or complexity. The Christian undertheme which keeps cropping up in random places fits the story like a bad hairpiece, and is basically an annoyance. Please don't take this as hostility to Christians, I am one. But it just did not work in this book, and seemed like a add on to sell books. If you like mysteries, as I do, don't waste you time on this one."
4,a light mystery with an unusual heroine,"A self-proclaimed LOL (Little Old Lady), Ivy Malone is not your typical mystery-solver. I thoroughly enjoyed this mystery novel, and will be buying more books in this series."
3,Not my favorite,"The story was pretty good and Ivy Malone was an interesting character, but there was just too much religion for my taste. It's hard to find a good mystery in the middle ground (no F words in every sentence and no sermons). It seems to me that the story/plot should be the purpose of a novel."
4,Refreshing Book,"While reading ""Invisible"" I was again amazed at Lorena McCourtney's talent. While getting acquainted with main character Ivy Malone, I laughed, was intrigued and definately entertained. A very good book ! So uplifting and interesting.An Avid Reader,and McCourtney Fanfrom Il."
3,I like mysteries,"Started reading this while back, but have yet to finish it. Hasn't been particularly exciting up to this point. Maybe that will change. We'll see."
4,good book,"good book, Interesting read from a good author. Fast flowing and found interesting , would recommended it to all readers"
5,Great Unit,Bought this unit last year....It was everything I could have asked for...Quality construction and just the right size. Carries a lot of stuff. Also bought the bag and it also is great.
2,"Would not repurchase / cheaply made, poorly packed","I sent the packaging review with a photo. Arrived shredded box w scraped finish. I see other people have the same issues. Amazon-- you fulfilled, You're not listening to customers.Then straight to Home Depot.1. No (red) reflectors at all, as shown in product photo, so had to purchase my own today. 2. Replaced the hardware/ all made in China. One good bump or a little brush and it would be off the hitch. 3. Having hole for hitch re-drilled and moved closer to vehicle so weight will be distributed better. Would definitely not repurchase. Will rethink purchases like this from Amazon."
3,Eh ....,"At the time of its release, ""Down For The Count"" seemed more impressive. After ""Black Tiger"" and ""Mean Streak"" set a tone, ""In Rock We Trust"" seemed to carry the Y&T legacy forward, but cutesy, keyboard-infused ditties like ""All-American Boy"" almost ground the momentum to a halt. Even ""Summertime Girls,"" likely the band's most well-known single, seems to feature the wispy keyboards as much as Dave Meniketti and Joey Alves' dual guitars. Despite that, ""In The Name Of Rock"" is a great leadoff to the album, and even the band's recast of Loggins & Messina's ""Your Mama Don't Dance"" will have you singing as you rip down the road. ""Down For The Count"" doesn't exactly disappoint, but it won't exactly leave you in breathless excitement either. A must have for fans, but the casual listener might want to try something else."
4,Knock You Out!!,"This is a very rare album to find. Contains the classic ""Summertime Girls"" and my personal favorite, ""All American Boy"". Very much an 80's hard rock style of production. The band was big in California (as they are from the Bay Area), but very well respected. Gritty, true, radio friendly rock. Power-chord riffs all over the place, but a must have for any true fan of 80's style hard rock - get it, you won't be disappointed!If you don't like it, let me know, I have friends that would buy it in a heartbeat!"
4,Author's Up-date,"**The rating above is by the author. It was required by Amazon.com in order to submit this notice. The author gave a ""4"" simply because of the many excellent reviews the book received when it came out in print.From the author:""Just a quick note to tell all those interested that my book, ""The Battle of Cedar Creek: Showdown in the Shenandoah,October 1-30, 1864,"" will be republished soon.The new version is a completely revised and expanded edition, with much greater scope in coverage and primary source research.The initial edition received the highest reviews, and, published in limited runs,the book has been a much-sought-after item according to those interested in the battle and the 1864 Shenandoah Valley Campaign.Keep checking back to Amazon.com for updates. In all modesty, I believe you will find the book much-improved and well worth the wait.Thank you for your interest.Theodore C. MahrDayton, OhioDecember, 2004"
1,"Worlds of History: A comparative Reader, Volume One: To 1550","The supplier hides behind Amazon, so you can not get to them... I ordered the 3rd edition and they shipped the 2nd edition.. They will not respond to my emails to make it good/credit the purchase. What a waste of my time and money. Do not purchase from Amazon you can not get resolution to any problems."
2,Drones,"This movie is really good. Angela Bettis is a treat as always. Unfortunately the only way to get this movie is through Amazon's Manufactured on Demand service. I don't know if it's a side effect of this process, or if the DVD wasn't encoded right or if that's the way the transfer is, but this DVD is NOT anamorphic 16x9. It is letterboxed widescreen which means that if you're watching this on a widescreen TV, you'll not only get bars on the top and bottom but bars on both sides as well. I can produce an anamorphic 16x9 DVD right here in my home from my laptop. It's disappointing that a product manufactured by a large company can't be the same. The movie is definitely worth seeing and if you can find a way to see it, go for it, but I can't recommend this product as is until they fix this issue."
3,4:3 Letterboxed,"The movie is great... 5 Stars.However, this January 2012 DVD release is 4:3 Letterboxed.Did I mention it's a 2012 release?Yeah, way to go Phase 4 Films."
4,Modelling the Marder Self-Propelled Gun (Osprey Modelling),"Modeling some of the most obscure German vehicles of the Second World War, this books fills the void of very unique armor of the self propelled gun family. Good modeling techniques are descriptively written with blocks of photos showing the build in progress. 1/35th kits Tamiya, Alan and Ironside, are featured. This one is needed for your reference shelf."
5,anxiety releiver,I use this product after feeling anxious. It has been a life saver. After about 20 minutes my anxiety will start to lift.
1,tape quality,"I will not request a return issue as these are hard to come by.I love Sergio Mendes and have 98percent of the collection of his albums,I won't return this cause of the rarity,but the physical quality of the tape was so poor,it sounded like it was taped in a fishbowl.As I said I won't request a return etc.one because of its rarity and also the cd's price of a hundred,fifty plus ,even with it being rare seems very outlandish to a fan of Sergio Mendes..I did want to add one more thing,I was contacted back from vendor and he was very fair and offered compensation,the quality of the tape was the age no doubt,but I did want to clear this up that the vendor was more than fair and cooperative.Once again I will add a CD @ 150.plus is stupid,unless it is a complete rarity of understandable reason,looking today on list 134. is still a stupid price.This CD was not a personal recording of Lennon and Yoko Ono @ the Dakota or something. I love Sergio Mendes but there is no reason for this price."
3,A Diamond in the pile!,"This whole effort was doomed from the beginning. The 80's were generally not kind to Sergio Mendes, his genre and his offerings. The MOR sound he was dumping out was quick to grab and quicker to disappear. Those of who know this genius' stuff, however, have found a diamond in the pile of banality here. The Dori Caymmi tune ""The River (O Rio)"" which is at the very least one of the best songs he wrote amoung the thousands.The Mendes treatment of this musical gem, with Caymmi himself doing voice and guitar, is worth the price of a ticket if it were not laced with so much lard.Don't buy this unless you are a collector and need it to complete the discography..because unless I am wrong, there's a copy bootlegged, at a yard sale or another source's catalog for a lot better price."
3,"Good General Info, But Short on How-To","This book provides good general information about the new Windows Installer, but it's weak on examples and how-to information. Only one chapter (Chapter 7) provides examples of the steps involved in using the Installer, and those examples are limited to modifying an existing .msi file, not creating one.The author promises a complete walk-through in Chapter 12, but it's not there. Instead, the chapter offers an overview of various installers (InstallShield, Visual Studio, and Wise). But again, there are no examples.Many developers are trying to figure out how to incorporate various Microsoft technologies, such as MDAC, into Windows Installer files. The book suggests using a custom action, but doesn't provide a step-by-step example of how to do it. This alone would have made the book worth its price."
3,Good overview of the Windows Installer,"This book would be a great book for someone who is new to the Windows Installer. Although it contains much of the same information as the SDK, it is much easier to read. Things added beyond the SDK include a discussion of Installer editing tools, a list of available merge modules and small notes throughout the book discussing little intricacies that add some value. A discussion of installing MDAC, a pain in NT, is also included. Things that would have been nice to see but were not included are examples of installing MTS packages, more examples of custom actions and their associated rollback and uninstall actions and some more information on creating patches. This is currently the only book on Windows Installer and it gives a nice overview but I don't think it's for the advanced Windows Installer developer. Personally I was looking for a little more detail than it gave but I still find myself using it for reference here and there."
1,A mistake,I don't know why the title of this book is VB/VBA Developer's Guide to the Windows Installer. There are few VB/VBA Example code. The online help is more usefull than this book. Really this book is a mistake.
2,This is almost an exact copy of online manual!,"I really didn't learn much from reading this book. This book is piled with tables, lists, etc, which one can easily find in the Windows Installer online manual.A really good book should explain Windows Installer in a top-down fashion and illustrate the points using some examples. I know that MSI is a tedious and detail oriented architecture and it might not be easy to devise simple yet illustrative examples but those are the best help a developer will want. I hope that somebody can take up this task."
4,5% about VB/VBA and 95% about the Windows Installer,"""VB/VBA Developer's Guide to the Windows Installer"" by Mike Gunderloy is quite a useful book yet not enough to master creation of MSI files. I didn't see so far a single book that would be sufficient to fully cover all the quirks of the Windows Installer Service.Don't be afraid of the title of the book. The text is actually 5% about VB/VBA and 95% about the Windows Installer.The author now offers electronic version of the book for free download from his site.I would have recommended participating in the ""InstallSite Forum"" in addition to reading this book. Also, ""Practical Windows Installer Solutions for Building InstallShield Setup Applications"" by Bob Baker, is worth attention."
1,I wish I didn't buy this book,This book was unable to help me resolve any of my windows installer issues.
1,Outdated,This book has outdated materiel that is incorrect and may lead to possible wrong answers on the exam. The book is 5 years old and the laws regarding real estate have changed. Should stick to the newer books out there for exam review.
2,HOW TO PREPARE FOR THE FLORIDA REAL ESTATE EXAMS,"THIS BOOK CONTAINS INCORRECT INFORMATION i.e. CH. 4 illustrates ""Dual Agency "" and Figure 4-2 has a dual agency form. Dual Agency has been illegal in Florida since October 1997.A Transaction Brokerage relationship requires ""limited confidentiality"" but there is no mention of this either. This publication requires and up to date edition."
2,Not that good,Not the most through for residential appraisers. Now it is VERY outdated. I wouldn't bother.
5,first rate,What a silky smooth voice! Enjoyed his bio & so glad success came his way along his own winding road.
3,Not the perfume I remember...,I ordered this perfume as I remembered my mother using it in the forties and fifties. But this is not the perfume I remember. This is a very strong perfume. Did the chemistry change?
3,it has it's place,"Warm, sweet, spicy,and yes old fashioned. Not like today's perfumes, but at this price worth trying. A fall/winter scent, acceptable for work and somewhat romantic. Rent some old romantic movies or even ""It's a Wonderful Life"" from that era and cuddle up with your man, especially if you are 40-plus. Let me know how it went:)"
4,Mom's Perfume,"Gave this as a gift to my mom(She asked for it). She has worn it for years, and really likes it. Great price compared to anywhere else I looked."
5,Excellent Book..Tasty Recipes,I love this book. Its great for all those people who only like chicken. It has all sorts of variety on how to prepare chicken. Best loved recipe since I have bought the book..the Tomato Basil Chicken with Linguini..its DELISH. I look forward to trying more recipes in the future.
3,Didn't impress me much,"I used this for over a year (I participate in speed shows where shiny is not necessary) and while it does help remove a dull dusty appearance, there isn't a sheen like I would like. The horse I used it on was in great condition and after a bath, his coat would look great but I needed something for days when I didn't bathe him.I expected more. Even when I drenched his main in it, it looked dull."
5,REAL MISFITS,this is one of the greatest albums ever from one of the greatest bands ever. this is true rock 'n roll
5,"""In The Doorway"" is a lost classic","This definitely contains the best mixes of these songs, and ""In The Doorway"" is up there with ""Halloween"" or any other song considered a defining Misfits tune."
5,The Peak of Danzig,"Simply put, this CD is brilliant. Planned as their second release, this CD was shelved and didn't see the light of day for twenty years. And a shame it was too ... it's at this speed and clarity that Glenn Danzig's voice must be heard. In my opinion he is one of the greatest vocalists in rock and roll history, right up there with Elvis. I highly recommend this CD. It is one of the greatest punk albums ever, if not the greatest."
3,I CANT TAKE THE IGNORANCE !,"I'm so sick of reading Misfits reviews by people who dont know a thing about them. I've heard one moron refer to The Misfits as ""Danzigs side project from his real band"". DUH, learn your history. Another idiot who knocks the new Misfits for the the nickname ""Wolfgang Von Frankenstein"". HELLO! Have you ever even picked up a Misfits album. Try picking up Earth A.D. sometime, that's Doyle! OLD MISFITS! Others are trying to say that the new Misfits are much better than old. Come on people, I'm not knocking the new Misfits, I'm even going to see them on Halloween weekend, but be real, Glen Danzig is the Misfits hands down. There is no replacing him or the unique sound they created. He made it what it is. A classic that will be around forever."
1,This Isn't Very Good,"i listen to a lot of punk, like Blink 182 and stuff, and someone told me about the Misfits, so i bought static age and a shirt of them. lemme tell u, this is crap. i dunno why it sounds so bad. For one, there'e too many love songs on here.. wha wha, who wants to hear u cry about your car crashing?? Geez dood. Another bad thing about this cd is that it only has 8 songs, 4 of which are nothing but silence. Whats with that?* Point is : this cd will not fit in your tape deck, but then again, u prolly won't want it to because it's so bad *if u are into bands like Sum 41, the Backstreet Boys, or Disturbed, chances are you MIGHT like this. BUT, you also may NOT. it's like a mix of reggae-pop and heavy metal. i dunno, i don't like reggae too much, so maybe you won't like this. I don't think the lady can sing very well on this album. Hey, i bet I can sing better, right?? man, what a crappy tape. u gotta but this album!!cya guyz l8er!"
5,What more can you ask for?!,"Songs about murder, nihilism, Vincent Price films, the Kennedy assassination. . .it's all here. This is my favorite punk cd ever. A solid five stars. Not even London Calling or any Ramones album has got under my skin like this one has.Ignore those Hot Topic posers who wear Misfits t-shirts and buy this. Getting acquainted with this music is something that you will not regret."
5,wow,"hahahahha, i just got done looking at these reviews and it looks like you guys actually believed adios_lune was being serious. wow, have a sense of humor kids. But other than that, this is the best misfits cd. And i can say that, for it is the best, not just my personal opinion. It's just plain beautiful. And many of you seem to really like Danzig and his solo career. And then you all hate the new misfits and samhain because they sound nothing like the old misfits. Danzig sucks now, heavy metal riffs and lame satan imagery. But whatever, i guess that really is a personal opinion. Thats it."
4,Misfits Misfits Misfits-what else can you say,"This one of the greatest misfits cds ever.I enjoyed Collection 1 a little more..............however this cd still kicks butt.I love almost every singletrack on this cd.""We are 138"",""Attitude"",and ""Last Caress"" are my favorites on the CD and are classics"
5,Glenn Danzig is the greatest!!!!!!!!!,"I usually write long reviews, but I am not going to for this album. I will just say this, Glenn Danzig has the best voice I have ever heard. He is an amazing singer, and this album is perfect. It is however the 2nd best Misfits album of all time behind ""Walk Among Us"", which is even more perfect because every song on that album is perfect. This album has a few songs that I am just not into like ""Return of the Fly"", ""Come Back"", ""Hollywood Babylon"" and ""Theme for a Jackal"", but every other track is incredible. Buy this album and every other Misfits album. They are the COOLEST band of all time, and Glenn Danzig is the COOLEST singer and has the BEST voice of all time!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Possibly the best punk album ever!,"You see my dear friends i dont like punk very much at all. There are a few good band like the sex pistolsand the damned. Me I like metal. Slayer, Dio, Black sabbath, Rainbow, Deep purple. And i know some one might shoot me but i also love Progressive rock. Yes, King crimson, ELP, and rush. One fateful day my friend mike showed me a song OH it was a wonderous song. It was called ""Astro Zombies"". Right from then ive been hooked. I now own all the misfits albums (including new. I love the misfits more than the newfits but there both GREAT)These guys dont bore me with social commentary (i go to an alternative school i get enough of that already) they have lyrics that represen my favorit genre of movies HORROR!!!!!1! Now onto this album. Great production. Amazing songs. This album will make you scream ""WE ARE 138..WE ARE 138!!!! WE ARRRRRRRRRRE 138!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,great starting point for new fans,"If you're new to the Misfits, this is the best place to start in my opinion. As the booklet in the CD says, Static Age was recorded very quickly and comes off sounding really raw and dirty as a result - but that's not a bad thing! The band obviously know what they're doing, and storm through the songs with real energy. Static Age is full of great tracks, some highlights being 'Last Caress', 'Attitude', 'Bullet' and the simple yet brilliant 'We Are 138'. Top notch punk, a lot of fun to listen to.This version of the CD comes with two hidden tracks, the first of which is a 8 minute collection 'Outtakes' from the recording sessions - it's just a lot of snippets of the starts of songs, or band members commenting on tracks... nothing spetacular, but cool none the less."
1,My mother always told me...,"If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all. So here it is...This rocker has a beautiful color and finish.Okay. Done... That being said, it is the most uncomfortable chair I have ever sat in, in my LIFE!! My husband bought this for me to rock our son in. This is not the right type of chair to do that in. the height is awkward for me to reach the floor while ricking. If I sit in it for more that about 10 minutes my butt goes to sleep. The back is uncomfortable and the bars at the head area hit in a way that makes it impossible to rest your head on it and be comfortable. I would not recommend this chair to anyone. I wish I could give it away!! It just takes up space in my living room. It will never really be used. Don't buy it. Gliders are a much more comfortable chair to rock it. Let these old fashion rockers go. ICK!!!"
4,What A Debut Back In 1987!,"With 'Discovery', Shanice had a few dance hits like 'No 1/2 Steppin' & 'Tell Me Can You Dance', (and a few other filler dud tracks!), but I really enjoyed her slow jams, where she SANG like it was no tomorrow. Songs like 'Do I Know You ?', 'Just A Game', and 'The Way You Love Me' still sound fresh TODAY, and are great illustrations of Shanice's awesome talents. Also, if you own 'Discovery', consider remastering it by adding Shanice's classic duet with Kiara from 1988 titled 'This Time'. I'm suprised the record company didn't do this already, but que sera sera!!Peace, SD(of Chaka's World)"
3,Mostly boring,"Last days of Patton lasted two hours and twenty six minutes. I believe this movie with a reduced script should of lasted no more than one and a half hours. The last hour of this movie was about Patton lying on a hospital bed. After ten minutes or so seeing him paralyzed, you knew what the inevitable outcome was. Somehow, I think the old general would not want us to remember him this way. The timeline started in June 1945, which would of been more appropriate if the movie started on V/E day. Viewers would get a better sense of what this movie is all about. I gave this this movie a three star rating because of George C. Scott's portrayal of the General George Patton was outstanding. If the script was better this easily would be a five star movie."
3,not for oily skin...,"I have been looking for an ideal day cream for my oily skin for years now and unfortunately this product is not meant to be the one. It smells delicious but leaves a sticky, disagreable residue on the skin and makes me break out. Also, I give it an A-plus for purity (which is what attracted me to the brand in the first place) but only a so-so on efficacity. I think it works great as a hand cream though..."
2,Beck Arnley tie rod for Peugeot 505,"The Beck Arnley 101-3554 Tie Rod Assembly seems well made and is listed by many automotive parts sites as being proper for a Peugeot 505, but it does not fit. The inner rod is about an inch too short. With a cut-off blade in a circular saw I was able to cut 2.5 inches off the end of an old inner rod, cut 1.5 inches of the new inner rod and cut the threaded part off an old outer joint. I assembled these into a working inner tie rod. I cut about 1/3 inch threads off the new outer joint, and then installed the now workable pieces."
2,Not if you're serious about starting a business...,"I ordered this book and 'Starting an eBay Business for Dummies' by Marsha Collier at the same time. I've already had some success with eBay auctions, and am seriously looking for some ideas to get an eBay business off the ground. While I found Marsha Collier's book to have a great deal of useful information, this book is more or less 550 pages of pretty useless information to someone already mildly savvy with the eBay process.If you are new or just beginning with eBay, you might find this book useful, if you want to sit down and read about eBay at length. But the best way a new person will learn about eBay is to get out on the site and play around. Once you have bid and/or sold, I think you'll find that this book doesn't have a lot to offer you.The only useful section of this book was the area that addressed buying/selling strategies. Not enough info for me to keep the book - it's currently on half.com... :)"
2,Not for the eBay buyer or casual seller,"If you are an eBay buyer or casual seller, this book isn't for you. This book is more appropriate for someone whose goal is to setup an entire business around eBay rather than those of us who use eBay casually.I was hoping to learn expert bidding and selling tips and tactics. Instead, the book focused more on tools and how to improve sales processes.I was also amazed that in the section about credit card payments, services like Paypal were not even mentioned. I could over look this if it weren't for the fact that the book was published in December of 1999.If you are primarily an eBay buyer or only sell a handful of items a month or year, I'd look elsewhere."
2,not what i was hoping for......,"this book was a disapointment. though very easy to read, it provided only a superficial definition of the many aspects of online buying and selling. there is no reference value to this book. i would recommend this book only for the individual that has no auction or online experience and is wondering ""what is ebay""? for the more literate or experienced user, try the official ebay guide written by laura and michael kaiser. again ....... this book was a great disappointment."
2,Ho Hum,"Very basic information. This book is for the beginner just learning the ropes about eBay. If you have been using the site for some time now, then you know just as much as whats in this book.The resources for sellers to find ""wholesale"" products were terrible. The sites basically sell junk or overpriced refurbs."
4,"Helpful, Concise, Complete, Needed","An excellent book for E-Bay sellers (or buyers) -- a fine listing of almost anything you can think of to sell, and the approx price of them. I found it to be very useful for my e-bay business."
5,Tons of information for newcomers and oldies,"This book is packed full of information for anyone who uses ebay. Buyers and Sellers, they've got everything you will ever need to know in here. I would recommend this book if your needing some extra cash and you are going to use ebay. This book will show you how to milk the most out of ebay and attract more members. It will show you how to get the word out, make your auction look more professional, and tons of do's and dont's of ebay."
3,Look elsewhere first,"An average book. Does not contain any information that the other books don't contain. I recommend looking at other eBay books instead of this one. An overuse of white space makes this book very big.After reading the top eBay books, below are my recommendations:---Beginner with eBay and computers---1. The Official eBay Bible---eBay Seller---1. Sell it on eBay2. eBay Hacks---Full-Time eBay Business (not for the casual seller)---1. eBay Strategies2. eBay Business the Smart Way"
2,"Close, but no cigar....","I'm fairly experienced with eBay, but even so, I know I have a few tips and tricks to pick up. That said, I bought this book and another one, ""Starting an eBay Business for Dummies"". I found the Dummies book to be a much more well organized and thought provoking book. ""eBay the Smart Way"" was much more like, duh, I know that already, tell me something I don't know so I can profit from your knowledge or experience. Nope, nada, nothing. Check out the Dummies books on eBay for a much more rewarding read."
2,Not worth the time reading or money!,"If you want a general book about ebay and easy reading with not much meat, this is the book for you. If you already sell on ebay, you won't learn anything from this book at all. I rated this book a 2 only because someone who never sold on ebay would get a little information from this book. How can anybody rate this book a 5. Ebay for Dummies is a little better. A lot less reading to gain better insight."
2,Spend any time on Ebay and you don't need this book,"If your new to ebay, this book is probably everything you need, but if you understand how it works, save your money for something else."
2,Borrow From The Library,"This book does not provide much more information that you can learn on eBay in a short time or by reading the site documents. Some people, even experienced, will learn a few things but you would be much better off picking this up at the library before purchasing a copy."
3,What do you like better?,"I have read only part of this book, so far. I would like to know from the reviewers who gave it only one or two stars, what books they do recommend. Several reviewers suggested buying a better book, but they didn't say which one. I am a long time ebay buyer, but woul like to get good up-to-date info on how to become a seller, including software and other needed equipment. I use an iMac."
2,It was ok...,I need something more advanced. This book is VERY BEGINNER and there are NO hidden secrets or very helpful hints. Basically is just a walkthrough of the eBay site and how to make a listing - it doesn't really have anything that the ebay site doesn't have.
3,Who put the disco in my punk rock?,"If you are a fan of club re-mixes, then maybe Shonen Knife ""Ultra Mix"" will be for you. I, however, am not and this CD left me cold.It is difficult to find the Shonen Knife that I know and love buried in the studio tricks and dance beats. All the charm is missing. All the fun is not to be found. I know that this is the very point of dance mixes, to hide the song inside something club-danceable, and it does do that. If I were going to DJ, I might grab for this.On the plus side, it does sport one of the best Shonen Knife album covers I have seen. Very cool, but too bad it is not on another CD.For true Knife Collectors only, or fans of dance re-mixes."
4,Gap theory - Bible gets clearer,"For those in doubt about how the so-called Creationism explains 10-million-year fossiles et similes, you have to read ""Earth's Earliest Ages"". Afterwards, you may read Fields' book about the Gap Theory. Good book, clarifying about the main reasoning lines. Go for it!"
2,Not for small-medium power boats,"Perhaps useful if you own a large sailboat, but not very relevant for a lake-bound 23' powerboat. Expected more diagrams."
3,A pretty good intro to boating,"I wish more people read something like this. Whilst not exhaustive, it is a good introduction to the essentials."
2,dissapointed,A bit dissapointed with this album after the reviews i read on Amazon.Got a good price so that was okay but would not reccomend this to true Supertramp fans.
1,A good reason why we need 0 stars!,"The review system should include the ""no stars"" option, and this album is the reason why! Contrary to rumour, Supertramp was *NOT* Diana's favorite group. It was DuranDuran! The ways in which this CD is bad are too many for me to mention. Avoid and get something else, please. Actually, Madonna's ""Confessions on a Dancefloor"" is a good place to start."
2,not so fluffy after a while,"These were lovely and soft when new, but after not very many washes, they lost that velvety feel. Still work fine, but not so flannel-y. Also, the top sheet ended up a bit too narrow for the queen-sized bed they're supposed to fit.However, the price was right!"
4,A boy in the girls bathroom???!!!!,"Thats what I thuoght when I red the cover. It actuly wasn't half that bad. A good humorous book. (All of Louis Sachar's books are funny) I liked it. But, I'll have to admit... its NOT on my top 10 list. It would be a good book for someone who likes humor. (or Louis Sachar's books.)"
5,I loved this book!,"The character portrayals in this book are sensitive. I loved the way Bradley talked with and played with his animals, so like the way I played with my dolls, that hardly anyone seemed to understand. I loved the techniques Carla used to get under Bradley's skin, to realize he was a good person and to start believing in himself. Pop psychology is always entertaining. This is a good book for anyone who likes to see things from the viewpoint of another person. It's funny and interesting and has realistic children in it."
5,Bradley is in the house Ya'll!,"I read the book, There's a Boy in the Girl's Bathroom. I give it a five because it's a good book. It's about a boy Bradley and he is a bully. Bradly doesn't make any friends. Bradley Chalker even gets beat up by a girl! I think every kid should read this book because it teaches you about being a bully and how bullies don't have friends. This book also teaches kids why it is important to be nice.V.S. ""Jamie"""
4,There's a Boy in the Girls' Bathroom,This is a very good book. It is called There's a boy in the Girls' Bathroom. I would give it a mixed review because some parts of the book are boring but then it gets better. If you like books that are funny and kind of stupid (in a good way) it is a good book for you. It is about this boy who is named Bradley and he has some problems. He goes to a counselor during school and her name is Carla Davis. She helps him with his problems and makes him a better person and friend.
4,TAY TAY HAY,"WELL, THIS BOOK IS MY FAVORITE BECAUSE, it reminds me about my brother walking in the girl bathroom on accident. I laughed at him. I liked it because they screamed that made me laugh again. That was the best book I have ever read in my life."
4,DJ's book report,This book was cool but not as cool as holes but I liked this book to it had some adventure. I liked how Bradly was sortive snotty in the begining and cool in the end. I liked this book it was cool.
4,There&#65533;s a Boy in the Girl&#65533;s Bathroom,"...The main characters of this book are Bradley Chalkers, and Jeff Fishkin. Now let me introduce you to our characters Bradley Chalkers is a very mean boy, he will spit on you for no reason and you don't want that to happen because he can spit as good as John Elway can play football!!! Jeff Fishkin is the new kid at the school he gets made fun of all the time, because he's new but he is really nice ones you get to now him. I got to get to the story now, Bradley has to go to the counselor so he gets a little bite nicer. The problems in this story are that Bradley is mean, Jeff and bradley are always at each other, Now for the worst problem of them all Jeff and Bradley went in the girls bath room!!!"
4,You Have to Read There's a Boy in the Girls Bathroom,"YOU HAVE TO READ THISIt's realy funny.It's about a boy named Bradley and he has a behvor problom. So he starts going to a counselor ( named Ms. Davis/Carla ).When Bradley meets a boy named Jeff they become friends.Bradley starts acting better, but when a sudden sad thing happens his whole world turns upside down. When he gets a letter his life turns rightside up again and gets invited to a birthday party. And at that birthday party he has a blast!"
4,A kid's reveiw,"Bradley Chalkers is the oldest kid in his class who loves to lie and likes to pick fights, and beat up other kids, and does not trust anybody. The new school counselor wants to be Bradley's friend, but he does not trust her. Carla knows that Bradley is sensitive and kind, she thinks he just has to believe in himself. Meanwhile somebody is in the girls' bathroom...Gia"
4,This is an interesting book!,There's a Boy in the Girls Bathroom is a book that takes place in a troubled fifth grade boy's life. Bradley is the oldest kid in fifth grade and has serious behavior problems. Nobody in the fifth grade likes Bradley no one even sits next to him! The plot begins when a new kid arrives and has to sit next to Bradley. Jeff is from Washington D.C. and is new to school. Jeff and Bradley are friends at times and enemies during others. The main problem is Bradley has to go to counseling! Bradley thinks he hates the counselor but he isn't completely positive about how he feels. Does Bradley turn his life around? Will Jeff and Bradley become friends or rivals? Does Bradley like his counselor? Read the book to find out.
4,Great for the young or old,"There's a Boy in The Girls' Bathroom is an excellent book conveying the feelings of kids trying to find their place among one another. Louis Sachar does a wonderful job explaining the emotions involved in being an outcast and the complicated reasons for odd behavior. While easily speaking to children about the passive aggressive nature of friendships, adults also are able to gain insight into one another. There's a stern scolding to parents who get so caught up in grades and preparing for their child's future that they forget about their present day feelings and needs.Sachar blends a nice amount of humor into the book, keeping the book from getting too heavy with emotional tugging. It's a touching book but joyful as well. It reminds the young and old alike to appreciate one another and approach each other with tolerance as well."
4,Awesome Book!,"There's a Boy in the Girls Bathroom by Louis Sachar is a story that should be read for the silly title alone. Bradley Chalker's and Jeff Fishkin are best friends. Bradley Chalker's goes into the girl's bathroom because he is mad at the teacher who helps him.The reason this book is a must read because it is very funny. This story is filled with both sad and good parts. Bradley fakes that his arm is broke so he doesn't have to play in a baseball game against 6th graders. Bradley gets invited to a birthday party.Here are a couple inserting facts about Louis Sachar. He worked in a sweater warehouse in Norwalk, Connecticut. Louis Sachar's wife Carla was the model for the counselor in There's A Boy in the Girls Bathroom. Pick up this book for a good time.Timothy Carle"
4,The bully who changed,"The Boy in the Girl's Bathroom is a great book it was about a boy name Bradley Chalker . He was a really funny kid but in school he was a bully and has no friends and get really bad grades.The story takes place in an elementary school in the present day. Bradley Chalker is a boy 12 years old Bradley is a boy who alway lies and fails almost all his tests and is a school bully and he has little hope. There is a new counselor that helps him with his life she tried to change his mean ways.My favorite charcter is Ms. Carla,the counselor, because she never gave up on him.My recommendation is to people 11 to 14 years old read this book because it an inspritional book that might help you be a better person."
4,The Ultimate Review!,I read There's a Boy in the Girl's Bathroom and I enjoyed it. Bradley is the main character in this novel. He goes through common troubles in his school. What if your only friend moved away? What if you were never able to do your homework? What if you had to go through life lying? Those are just some of the problems he deals with.
4,There's a Boy in the Girl's Bathroom,I just read There's a Boy in the Girl's Bathroom by Louis Sachar.It was about a troubled kid who eventually tries to be normal..It is a funny and enjoyable book. If you like realistic fiction you would love this book.
5,"Bradley Chalkers, The Fifth-grade Monster","This looney story is about Brady Chalkers, an ill-behaved fifth grader (Last seat, last row) He is known at school as the biggest bully.

4,how I fill about this book,It was a entresting book about a buli that get's nicer.girls verry mean! Somone gits in love.(only young children)
4,A really great book to read,"If you like funny books this is the book for you! This book has a lot of funny parts in it. I gave this book 4 stars because some parts are confusen and some funny. My book is about a boy that is a really big bolly and then turns in to a nice boy. This is a really funny book, and confusen at the same time. I hope you enjoy this book."
5,Teacher Recommended PV5b,"In this book an very troubled outcast child, Bradley Chalkers, learns the true meaning of friendship and trust when he befriends a new student. The book takes the reader through Bradley's ups and downs as he tries to overcome his bad behaviors and work through his unstable emotions.I read this book to my class at the beginning of each school year. The children's enthusiasm is so great they chant ""MORE!, MORE!, MORE!, MORE!"" to get me to keep reading. THEY LOVE IT and you will to. Louis Sachar really knows how to keep them interested! Read it and see for yourself!"
5,Not just for kids!,"I first got this book when I was about 9 or so. I'm now 24 and have since reread the book several times. While it is a funny and touching story with morals and lessons targeted toward the younger audience, it is also just a funny and touching story, one that ANY reader, no matter how old, will be sure to appreciate.For a story about the simpler times of adolescence (or so we think in retrospect), told with a quiet maturity that comes only with adulthood, READ THIS BOOK! And then read it to your children."
2,THE BOY IN THE GIRL'S BATHROOM,I liked this book it was good and awsome. I would all was read this book because when the boy was mad he would shout at peole like his friend. When I mad I shout at my friends.
4,There's a Boy in the Girls' Bathroom,"I am A.R.B a fifth grade student at Waldron Mercy Academy. This was on of the best books I have ever read. Bradley is the oldest kid in them fifth grade at Red Hill School. He tells enormous lies. He picks fights with girls so no body likes him. So there is this new kid named Jeff, and Bradley is nice for once. Well it doesn't stay like this for long. He starts being mean again. So he gets sent home with a letter to go to the counselor named Clara. When he goes he learns that you should like people for who they are in the inside not on the out. Then... I hope you find out what happens next (P.S. This a real page turner you can't put it down.)"
3,Everyone hated Bradley,"Characters: Bradley, Jeff, and Carla. There's a boy named Bradley who everyone hated. No one liked him ecept for Carla the school counselor. When Jeff the new kid came to school Bradley said to him ""Give me a dollar or I'll spit on you"" So Jeff gave him a dollar. At the end of the day Bradley went up to Jeff and said "" I'll give you a dollar if you be my friend so they became friends. One day Bradley was chased into the girls bathroom by Jeff and his friends. As time went by Bradley became nicer and nicer."
3,Student Review,"This is a book you've got to read! In this book There's a Boy in the Girl'sBathroom there is a boy named Bradley. Towards the begining he is a bully but towards the end he gets nicer. Bradley's class gets a new student named Jeff. Bradley does not like Jeff. In the end Bradley gets to be friends with Jeff. Some funny parts in this book are when Bradley talks to his stuffed animals, and when he gets beaten up by a girl. At certain points when I was reading, it was so funny I could have fallen off my chair if I did not stop. I think this is a funny book for kids and adults.Review by: JMC"
2,There's A Boy in the Girl's Bathroom,"Have you ever been in the girl's bathroom? Bradley and Jeff have. Jeff is new to the school. He got directions to the counselor's office but went the wrong way. Bradley thought Jeff was cool so he went in on purpose.Bradley has no friends and he gets bad grades. A new counselor has also come to the school. She is very glad to see Bradley. Bradley says he hates her, but is that true?This book has fantastic writing but I don't like the topic. I would not recommend this book to anybody unless they like the topic ""there's a boy in the girl's bathroom."" Otherwise great book."
4,A very meaningful book,"This is such a good book about a bully who turns into a lovely boy after a school councellor is hired. Unfortunately, She gets transferred to another school and leaves the former bully. But with all the knowledge she had taught him he made lots of friends and became a very like-able person."
5,There's a Boy in the Girls' Bathroom,"There's a Boy In The Girls' BathroomAuthor: Lois SacharThe main characters in this book are Bradley, Jeff, and Carla. Bradley is one of the schools most known bullies in his school, but everyday when he gets home, he plays with his little toy animals. Also, Bradley sometimes goes over to his friends house and play with his best friend, Jeff. Then he met a girl by the name Carla that also goes to their school too. Bradley thinks that he is in love her. Then after you read about this, you will find out why this book is called. There's a Boy In The Girls' Bathroom. This book was very funny and entertaining because almost everything that Bradley says is hilarious. I would recommend it to anybody that loves funny books, especially elementary school children. What is going to happen to Bradley next? How will he react?"
5,Louis Sachar Is A Genius!!!!!,"The great thing about this book is :a. you can read it more than onceb.you can read it as long as you can read, periodc.it's funny and classicallouis sachar is my all time favorite author.He makes you feel the way bradley feel.for instance if he's angry he write it in a strange way, it's too hard to describe.The characters were unique, the summary was enjoyable, he takes you to where bradley is. It brings tears to your eyes.he brought that charcter to life.It's not just any book, it makes you want to read all louis sachar's books.the point is louis sachar is a freakin' genius!!!!!"
5,Great Fun,"My 9-year-old and I read this together and had a great time. Reading of Bradley's adventures through 5th grade gave us great conversations... ""what would you do if you were Bradley?"" While full of fun, it also helped us make space to talk about some of the more serious, and challenging, aspects of growing up. We laughed together, groaned together, hid our faces, and howled. It was a real treasure, and a great book."
2,did anyone proofread this book?,"This book earns two stars on its merits: compact size; nice format; low price; and comprehensiveness. However, it gets no additional stars because of its many flaws: multiple typos; sometimes amateurish illustrations (see the TBY Sea Wolf on p. 93, apparently drawn by an 8 year-old); some very odd, unrepresentative choices of aircraft markings (for example, a Luftwaffe B-17F and a Soviet Air Force P-51!); and some glaring, flat-out errors (the entry on the Merlin-powered Spitfire Mk. I features a drawing of a Griffon-powered Spitfire Mk. XII... the Brits who produced this book should know the difference)."
4,Aircraft of World War II,"This is a handy reference book showing most of the main aircraft that saw action during WWII. Only the most serious aviation historians will identify planes that are not included in this volume. The book gives a brief account of the plane then adds a chart of motor, armaments, etc. There is a single drawing for each plane. However, an overhead view would have been nice to compliment the side views provided. Also many planes had several variations, and this volume does not give all relevant version information. But the book's purpose seems to be fulfilled and there are many other more detailed volumes out there if people really need theadditional information. This book is compact and can be carried anywhere in a small pocket. Not bad for the price."
2,entertaining but disapointing,"A collection that is not complete(3 out of 7 movies)including the first3 films made in 1965-66 (the last one was made in 1971)The ""commissioner x ""adventures are pure entertainment,007 style parodies,starring handsome italian actor Tony Kendall.With the assistance of former muscleman actor Brad Harris,they make anexplosive,entertaining team,in explosive,entertaining films.The picture quality ,unfortunatly,is not colorful on this dvd.Christian Karlsson,Sweden"
2,horrible copies,"Seeing these film in this condition, I wondered which film could survive this treatment and still be considered ""good"" in some way.These films are better than they are shown here. It could be, however, that the best of them is still the one which is not in thís collection, which was called ""drei grüne Hunde"" in Germany and which I saw at the Cinema Paradiso in Lugano when I was fifteen and totally loved. Cinema Paradiso in Lugano in the late sixties was however something very special - it cannot get more romantic than that - and maybe all films I saw there gave a better impression than they deserved."
4,I Love These Films!,"I agree with the previous reviewers that the film quality of these three movies is suspect (to say the least) however,the movies themselves are OUTSTANDING! and, if you can ignore some real poor pan and scan you will beentertained!My favorite is Death is Nimble, Death is Quick. Dan Vadis is great as KING. When he faces off withBrad Harris it's a classic moment, an apex of the Kommissar series in my view. Tony Kendall is his usual handsome(and cool) self in all three of these films.Sure, everyone wants high quality and surely these films deserve better but, with nothing else out therethis disc is worth every penny. I highly recommend these flicks."
4,Task oriented,"I love the arrangement of the book. There were times when I forgot a particular command to perform a certain task, and this book help me figure out which one could help. If it was organized by command name in alphabetical order, I would not buy it; since I would rather ""man"" when I remember how to spell out the command. On the other hand, if it could include a paramter list for loadable modules of NIC or SCSI, it would be more helpful. In short, I think this book is quite good for reference."
2,Missing too many commands,"This book is devoid of many of the basic commands, such as ""route"".Not only that, but the commands are organized into cateogories, rather than alphabetically. Once inside the category, the commands are alphabetical, but that helps little when searching for the commands in a hurry or just checking on the arguments and syntax. A lot of people would argue that such a book isn't necessary when you can type man ""command"" or use the --help switch, but the man pages are often semi-cryptic, and a little extra explanation goes a long way. Unfortunately, this isn't the book to get you there."
3,Obviously an early George and not as strong as the others.,"While this story doesn't stack up to George's later books, her characters are well developed and believable. Readers like me who are enchanted with Havers (particularly) and Lynley will enjoy getting to know them in this book. The real story behind Lynley and Lady Helen's long-standing engagement. Anyone dealing with elderly parents will understand Haver's dilemma with her mother. George's characters always seem to be real people with real problems. I'd advise starting with her later books -- ""Deception on His Mind"" is a good place to start -- then work backwards."
3,Good but not great,"I like Elizabeth George, but this is not one of her stronger works. It involves a deaf student who is murdered."
4,Town and Gown,"The 5th in the Inspector Lynley mystery series. A Cambridge undergraduate is murdered, and the University wants New Scotland Yard to investigate because of town-and-gown conflicts that might affect the impartiality of the local police. Inspector Lynley and Sergeant Havers are soon on the scene, which looks at first well-suited to the kind of class conflict that Elizabeth George has developed so well in this series. Surprisingly, the plot goes in a completely different direction, involving the victim's dysfunctional family, at least three men who may or may not have been her lovers, competition for a prestigious academic appointment and a troubling picture of how universities-and families-deal with the disabled. While unraveling these various plot strands, Inspector Lynley pursues his complex relationship with Lady Helen Clyde, and Sgt. Havers must make a painful decision about how to care for her aging mother. The crime is of course solved, but the stories of the two detectives go on."
1,"Dismal, depressing, dreary...","...all of which would have been OK if the plot had been able to keep one's interest: it doesn't. Elizabeth George's characters are a dysfunctional and improbable bunch, not one of them seem remotely realistic. The murder mystery disappears in a would-be psychological character study, and the result is frankly trashy and boring soap-operatic novel. George has a very bad understanding of English society, her portrayal of it is strangely quaint and doesn't reflect any England I've ever come across."
3,"Excellent book, disappointing mystery","Like all Elizabeth George's books, this is beautifully written and the characters are wonderfully well developed. As the title suggests. the story centers on the first victim, the sexy, charismatic Elena Weaver. In a good mystery, the solution seems inevitable once it is revealed. In this case, the solution is grounded in a relationship that is difficult to believe and thus is ultimately unsatisfying. The pleasure in the book comes from the continuing developments in the lives of the main characters: the relationships between Thomas Lynley and Lady Helen Clyde and Barbara Havers and her mother. It would not be a good place for a first-time reader of this excellent writer to start."
4,Starting this series,Just starting the Inspector Lynley series and am looking forward to catching up with all the books. That will take a while as there are many ahead of me. Elizabeth George is a great writer. Recommend to all.
3,"Good, But Not Very...","This was a good book in that the mystery was compelling -- out of the many possible murderers, not until very late in the book do you feel that you are coming close to identifying the killer. And it probably isn't who you think it is. But the book itself was dreary, peopled by dysfunctional characters. George is a good writer but she spends far too much time inside the psyches of her characters -- in other words, she overdoes it. And, as other reviewers have noted, the motive for the crime is shallow -- and weird. BUT, the book held my interest and despite myself, I like Elizabeth George's books. So, three stars is about the best I can muster."
4,For The Sake of Elena,love Inspector Lingley and Havers and how their lives evolve around their cases. Always enjoy a good read by Elizabeth George and exploring places in the UK.
3,Sub-par at Best,"It covers my phone, but thats about it. The way it fits in the picture is not how it fits on the phone in real life. The holes for speakers and the microphone are WAY off. It completely covers the light sensor, so my phone thinks that its in a dark room all the time. Worst of all, the darn thing ripped the first time I put it on the phone. The only hole that seemed to line up was the one for the camera. If it wasn't for that, I would have sent it back. Even if I didn't get a refund, Just so it didn't take up any space in the junk drawer. So if you need something to protect your phone from irritating scratches and don't mind the way it looks, the price is right. For everyone else, spend a little money and get something quality that fits the right way."
5,"Excellent for the price I paid, shipping costs are more.","Excellent for the price I paid, shipping costs are more."
1,Imported Junk!,"I bought a Over & Under Reamer set ($109) from Grizzly and they are the biggest piece of crap I've ever tried to use. The reamers have so much run-out that it makes no freaking difference which one you use because you end up with a hole reamed a few thousandth over sized every time. The reamers measure exactly a -0.001 or +0.001 but apparently the Chinese can't produce a reamer without visible run-out. If you need to precision machine a part, don't buy your tooling from Grizzly and expect good results because you'll just end up wasting your time, money, and re-buying it from a USA manufacturer to produce the part! Trust me, you don't need anymore extra frustration or to waste your hard earned dollars these days especially with the economy the way it is today."
4,Gorgeous album that you've probably never heard,"Double (pronounced ""Doo-blay"" in this case) was an 80s new-wave pop duo that did manage to score one big hit with ""The Captain Of Her Heart"", a song you've doubtless heard if you've ever been in a mall, department store, or doctor's office. The rest of the album is pretty good too, with atmospheric, entrancing songs like ""Rangoon Moon"" and ""Woman Of The World."" Even though the duo is generally regarded as belonging to the rock/pop genre, ""The Captain Of Her Heart"" is a song that works equally well in a smooth jazz setting."
4,Solid sound,"`Captain of Her Heart' was THE SONG of my pre-pubescence, and it still moves me as much as it did nearly 20 (yikes) years ago. I had the misfortune of seeing the video, which was an 80's-entrenched disservice to such a great song.Anyway, this album is 85% great. The only song I detest is `your prayer takes me off'. The lyrics are silly, the music dated. Did the producer's son sneak a track on this otherwise fine record? `Urban Nomads' is cheesy too, but it's guilty pleasure-so out it's in. It amazes me that the team who wrote 'rangoon moon' and 'captain' are the same who wrote 'prayer' and 'nomads'. oh well--can't be brilliant all the time.I love the lead singer's voice! Not a lot of range, but just right for the jazzy/pop sound of the music. He could read the phone book and I'd hang on every word. I hope these guys resurface someday."
5,A great album that needs to be re-released in the USA,I would love to buy this CD if it was available as a Domestic CD. I have the 45 Captain of her heart and hearing the other songs on 947 The Wave in Los Angeles. They are a great band that definatly need more airplay.Hope A&M; records re-releases it! Its well overdue!
4,very good collection,"double had a cool mellow vibe on this collection. what got me into double was ""Captain of her heart"" which is still a smooth cut that i can listen to on a breezy type of day. there are other nice tracks on this collection and worth checking out."
5,Old Show,This item is a gift. I wish these old shows were still on Tv and not some of the other nonsense.
3,the munsters,Like the old classic. Thought it was more than 2 seasons. Also thought there where more episodes in color. 2 thumbs-up.
3,scarry &funny blended ...,"well anyone who has watched all the old horrors ...knows the difference between them and munsters an adams family quite a relief in contrast ....nice to add a happy blend to sadness after all these years quite creative the creaters of these stories .... i think the future of holywood acters lies in its education and flare and spice of being able to except the chalenge of doing all the different genres especially the top 5 in alphabetical order ... animation biography ,comedy drama and epic you may see the 5 genre movie in alphabetical order male an female 60 minute 20 minutes each genre ...for example popeye 1 2 pasteur an barton 3 george burns an allen 4 ? cleopatra etc ...shdfh..."
5,Worth Every Penny....,"The Munsters Is My Favorite Halloween Themed Show (i'm not sure thats what you call it) And On This Wonderful 12 Disc Boxset You Get All Season 1 & 2 Episodes (including the never before aired original pilot episode.... in color!), A Color Version Of Family Portrait, 4 Documentaries, And 2 Munster Movies!!! Yes You Get All The Best Episodes On Here (well you get the complete series) Like Low-Cal Munster When Herman Tries To Go On A Diet On Thanksgiving, Or When Grandpa Make Eddie A Robot Brother In Eddie's Brother. I Just Love This Show! Pros: From What I Said Already You Should Know Already That This Dvd Is A Winner. Cons: None At All."
5,Perfect,This is the real The Munsters series that I was looking for. Perfect edition of the DVDs and 1st grade packing. Makes a great gift!
5,The Munsters: The Complete Series,got this a a gift for a family member they loved it. i went of the review after reading what everyone had to say most of them good i got this dvdset.
5,Very funny,I am glad I ordered this series. I really enjoyed watching all of this series again. Even the grandkids enjoyed them
4,Good old school TV,If you liked the Munsters back then you'll like seeing them again. This set includes the 2 Munster movies and gives a ton of history about the actors and the show. I haven't made it all the way through all the episodes yet but really enjoy the nostalgia of good TV.
4,Rediscovering the Munsters,"A great way to rediscover with my son,one of my favorite shows as a little kid his age. Wholesome viewing."
5,Classic 60's TV...love it,"I vaguely remembered this show from my childhood, so it was a joy to revisit Herman and his family again :)"
4,Things That Go Bump in the Night Fun,"The Munsters (1964-66) NBC. 1313 Mockingbird Lane, home of Herman Munster and Grandpa Count Dracula scaring the crap out of the neighborhood 365 days a year! B&W; fun and laughs, re-teamed Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis (previous series Car 54 Where Are You?). Strange things that go bump in the night, and all day! One of the ALL-TIME Top 50 TV Themes.The MunsterMobile, Spot the Family Pet, you have to look closely for all the gags or you'll miss them! That's what the pause button is for! Like the phone in the coffin!Filmed at Universal Studios Backlot, the set is still there today, it pops up in other shows and movies."
4,Great,Was lucky to pick this up on sale. We have enjoyed watching Munsters with our children. It is a lot better then the recent remake one time episode that was on tv this fall. So glad we can share with the kids the originals.
5,IMPOSSIBLE to recamend to highly!,Ihave never read a book that was this good. At one part of thew book I bursty out laughing and later on I could help but start crying! I can't beleive the life of a boy could be so awlful!
4,underrated from the underrated,"When looking back on my collection of Shriekback CD's (and LP's), this one is near the top. After ""Go Bang!"", I thought I had seen the end of one of my favorite bands - then again I though the same after they released ""Jam Science."" Sacred City, while not as complete as ""Oil & Gold"" or ""Big Night Music,"" does contain some excellent songs. If you are reading this and do not have it, buy it - and check out ""Local Gods, ""Beatles Zebra Crossing, ""Signs,"" and ""Every Force..."""
2,"fun, but flimsy","My 2-year-old received this for his birthday. He had lots of fun playing in it, but it tipped over easily and the sides were bent after playing in it only for one day. We purchased balls to put inside, but there are no bottoms on the larger structures, so balls do not stay in. I think we will be returning this and purchasing a different ball tent"
5,GOOD CHOICE,I bought this product for my four nieces and nephews and it could not of been a better buy. It is longer than I expected and the kids have lot of space to play. It does have a carrying bag for the smaller pieces and the tunnels are easy to put up or take down.
4,Good to entertain you child.,"I have two toddlers, and they really like it. The only drawback is that it's that my boys are a little too rough so at times the smaller structure keeps tipping over."
4,Much bigger than expected!,"Set up for this toy is a little more difficult than I had expected. There are lots of velcro snaps and tie closures to work with, but if your patient, you will figure it out before too long. The products included were much bigger than I expected. The main tent is huge for what I was thinking it would be. Lots of little toy balls included, and a golf club. After a few practices and a little more than a glance at the instructions, we figured out how to close the tents back up for storage. Anyone who has owned a playhut toy before would have no problems closing it back up. This is our first playhut structure, so we had to learn the ins and outs of taking it down and putting it up. Overall lots of fun, my daughter loves it."
4,Great fun for the kids,"This is a great toy for kids ages 2-7...My kids are always trying to make forts and houses, and this is perfect. They can crawl around in it, and there are games to play with this, too. I got mine for a great price and it was a little unusual to put together, but it didn't take more than thirty minutes to get it completely set up. My only complaint is that it's pretty big, so make sure you have a large area to put it. I wouldn't recommend it for outside. I don't think it would be very durable outside at all."
3,ok but not the best.,"straight out of the box some seams were not sewn together so the wire is showing.. sketchy. im keeping an eye on that. i purchased this for my 8 month old daughter, she loves the tunnels. i think the rest of the playhuts she'll grow into imaginatively, but for now its fun for hide & seek peek a boo."
4,Great value and very fun.,"We gave this to our girls (3 years and 20 months) for Christmas, and so far we've been very satisfied. I shopped a lot and read many reviews before purchasing this one, and I agree it's by far the best value out there (we paid $42). Three tents, two tunnels, and several games to play including basketball and soccer. It was hard to fold up when we traveled, but mostly we leave it up so that's not a huge hassle. We keep it in the playroom, and it's fun for the kids and their friends to play in."
4,A must have for the 924/944/951/968 owner,"Ok, the 968 section could be beefier, but the rest of the stuff is all there, options, colors, production data, pictures, etc. You'll love it."
5,continued inspiration,"i bought this book in the middle of my graphic design education, and i also like to create more character works for myself and i continue to look back on this book and flip through it for inspiration. it has a lot of visual goodies to get anyone who's stuck out of the creative mud and get thinking again."
3,not bad for a sequel,"This book is the sequel of the world famous Lingua Grafica: nice product, big idea but like every sequel is a little interesting confronted the first book."
4,Richie's review,Was very pleased with this book and has has got more of this series and is gradually working through them.
5,Great 'bridge' story between 'Rifles' and 'Eagle',A great way to fill in some gaps between 'Rifles' and 'Eagle'. A good solid read. I love Sharpe books! Hoping for a reboot of the movies!
3,Realms setting accessory,"This is a D&D 2nd edition Forgotten Realms boxed set describing the Tuigan, a mongol type people and their homelands, the area between the normal realms area, Al Quadim and Kara Tur. There is a novel trilogy based on this setting and the mongol type hordes that live there. There is also a trilogy of modules based on this product and setting.The boxed set covers a vast geographic area (roughly small continent sized)and so does not get as specific as smaller focused products. It does go into depth about the Tuigan people and culture.Probably best for having the complete overview of the official realms along with the products for the areas described above and Matica if a complete world overview is desired. Also useul if a DM plans on having a party actually travel to or from Kara Tur and the normal realms."
4,"Very Good, almost excellent","Edwards has done a wonderful job of covering the work of the Holy Spirit as The Creator Spirit. The only reason I would not give it five stars is that from a Protestant perspective I cannot quite get there with some of his Roman Catholic-specific teaching. However, if I were of the Roman Church I am sure my review would be an enthusiastic 5 stars. This is really a work that will satisfy the theologian yet has the accessibility to a wider audience of the well-informed lay reader. Overall a valuable contribution to Pneumatology."
4,Great guide!!!,"This is an excellent book for those still playing the first two Wing Commanders and their add-ons. Chock-full of hints and tips, with a narrative, it helps you utilize the best strategy to fully complete every mission."
2,Toothbrush bristle too hard,"I bought this set for my 20 months old son. The finger brush is good. The finger case part is sturdy, so your finger won't get hurt too bad when your kids bite on it. And its brush part works well too.The toothbrush's bristle is too hard. When I gave it to my son the first time, he immediately put it into his mouth since he had been very interested in a toothbrush for a while (I used to only use one finger brush on him). He of course did not know how to use it to brush his teeth but just biting on it. A few minutes later I could see some pinkish saliva dripped from his mouth, so I pulled it out. I saw the brush was tilted and 2 or 3 bristles sticking out from the brush. I tried the brush myself, and I felt it was not soft enough, and that 2 or 3 bristles really hurt my gum. I guess it hurt my son's gum badly and the pinkish saliva was from his blood. I never gave him this toothbrush again."
3,Baby finger brush is too hard,Both the gum and toothbrush with handles are great.the finger version is too hard for my baby and we ended up using the gerber finger toothbrush which is softer.
4,A nice set,a nice set but my 10 month old son still prefers my toothbrush... But it is a nice evolving set and good for teething.
3,Letters to God,I am sure the movie is great. But I have not been able to see it because the seller sold it broken
1,Oy Vey,"Oy Vey; we should have known better. My girlfriend (who is spiritual and somewhat religious) and I (an agnostic) rented this film because it was on sale but couldn't get through the whole thing. There is a group of (probably mostly church-going) people who will like -or love- this movie (as indicated by all the positive reviews here), but we found it preachy, pious, proselytizing, and all too predictable."
1,slow amature borring entertaining for christians only.,Well for certain christians are not movie critics. Apparently you can get five star reviews for any sappy amature movie if it features god/jesus saving/taking charge of our lives. Sorry I could only sit through half of it before boredom set in.
5,letters to god,this movie is a must see! this film has a lot of heart. even when someone is faced with hard times they always find away to leave a mark on the world.
3,great story but bad acting and directing (sorry),"It's a great uplifting story, great message but being honest, the directing and acting were just not there yet to brign this great story, the main character boy was played by a boy whose a bit too old (don't you all think?)and the characters were not deeply brought by the actors and actresses, it just shallowly expressed with smile and tears, that's about it. I appreciate their efforts and time, but it's way overrated if you rate it as high as the Blindside with Sandra Bullock, Fireproof with Kirk Cameron, Why Did I Get Married? with Tyler Perry, etc. That's just my honest opinion. Sorry if I offend anyone, really don't mean to, just an honest opinion to make movie maker take their masterpiece more seriously and everyone will be a winner ;p"
5,Wonderful Movie,My 8 year old daughter watched this movie and loved it. She cried herself to sleep after. I think this movie could be recommended for everyone
5,Inspirational movie,If you like the movies of the same people that did Facing the Giants then you will like this movie also. It is a really good family movie!!
2,"Good if you're religious, otherwise skip it","I could see where this film would be enjoyable if you are a religious person who enjoy uplifting films about how everything is part of God's master plan. I am not such a person, and really disliked this film.I rented this film to watch with my kids because I thought it would represent a good life lesson about what it would be like to be a child with a serious illness. I was a bit worried that the film would be overly religious, but based on a review I read at Amazon which said that it was a good movie even if you were not religious, I rented it anyway. Suffice it to say, I disagree strongly with that review. The acting isn't bad. The production qualities are okay. But watching the film was like fingernails on a chalkboard for me."
5,Letters to God,This was an inspiring movie that renewed my belief that God is working in our lives. The kind of movie I love my family to share
4,A Gift!,"I have not seen this movie yet, but have heard great things about it. I know my mother will love it, ad I look forward to brim able to watch it with her after she opens it this Christmas!"
4,Got it!,I love this movie... and it came very fast. Will be watching it soon as i can find my tissues.
4,touching,"emotional - The little boy delivers a very important message. The disease is foreign to me, so I also felt it was important to see some of what a child with cancer has to deal with."
5,Awesome,"This movie was made after a true story. It was heart penetrating, and meaningful. Awesome with so sooo much substance. Wonderful."
4,Better Than I Anticipated,"When I saw, ""Letters To God"" being advertised, I had no desire to watch it. I don't know why, really. But for some reason it just did not appeal to me. But it did appeal to my 16 year old daughter so tonight we watched it on Netflix instant stream and all I can say is...""Pleasantly Surprised"".I expected it to be over-the-top acting, as most Christian films I've seen are, but aside from the constant talk about God, religion, heaven, and spirituality, it wasn't one of those hokie ""Christian"" films at all. It, in fact, was rather well done.I rented this video to review."
3,"Decently Done Film On Illness, Life and Death","A based-on-a-true-story-movie about growth and change, life and death, and the process involved in all of those. So-so in the likability department because of some cheesiness and predictability, and the subject matter. Don't expect to be untugged in the emotion department because there are definite heart string pulling moments. But not so sad that you will go through a box of tissues unless you are struggling with huge emotional stuff.I think this would be a terrific movie to watch with a kid who might be going through a situation with a friend or relative with a serious illness. Dying is a part of life and this film handles death with sensitivity and dignity."
5,Wonderful History of Us Companion,"The teaching guide is a wonderful companion to the History of Us book. It enables the teacher to get the ""Big Idea"" across to the students, utilizing critical thinking, rather than looking for the memorization of facts."
3,Does Grief Need to be So Narcissistic,"One of the things that occurred to me when reading this book is what Leonard Fein's other daughters must feel if they should read this book. He makes this daughter's death into a cosmic tragedy; somehow it even becomes part of the Holocaust, and the author's grief is like no other grief. I read the whole book because it was part of a book club assignment. Otherwise i wouldn't have finished it because the author was too full of himself grieving."
5,A social activist engages in emotional activism,"Leibel Fein has one of the most important voices on the global issues of Jewish and national life. His new book offers us a glimpse into the soul of one of the great phrase-makers of our time. Fein recounts life's greatest tragedy -- the death of a child -- and writes poetically and forcefully about his own struggles and healing. You will read and re-read this beautiful book, and you will offer it in love to those who have suffered through similar experiences, and they will meet Leibel as a new and welcome fellow pilgrim and friend."
4,Keep Your Eye On Me By Herb Alpert,"Keep Your Eye On Me was released in 1987 as Herb Alpert's huge comeback music. He teamed with Jam and Lewis who shaped Janet Jackson Control earlier in her career. This CD was given the jazz a brand new direction with Keep Your Eye On Me, Diamonds, and Making Love In The Rain were smash dance grooves. The CD was bought at Amazon was amazing rare because not many CD copies were around at that time either sold or out of print as this moment. If you ever find a copy of Keep Your Eye On Me on CD; remember, come and get it before it will extinct."
4,"Not his most classic work, but impeccable taste in guest vocalists","Nothing on this album quite reaches the heights of Alpert classics such as ""Route 101"", ""Zorba The Greek"" or ""Tijuana Taxi"", but you will get an early taste of Janet Jackson and Lisa Keith on the songs ""Diamonds"" and ""Making Love In The Rain""."
3,pretty good,Jam&Lewis were at the top of there game when this came out.together with Herb albert & janet jackson they cut Diamonds which was sounding tight.making love in the rain was a cool slow jam.keep your eye on me was tight as well.the only problem is that Herb Albert seemed to be more in the background than anything.he is a okay trumpet player but nothing he has ever done reminds me of Miles Davis.
2,Bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I LOVE THE TJB, NOT HERB'S SOLO CAREAR. HERB, MAN U WERE WACKY WHILE RECORDING THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Funky Herb!,"This was Herb Alpert's last platinum album. Four of the songs were produced by the hit producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. ""Diamonds"" features Janet Jackson's vocals. ""Making Love In The Rain"" also features Janet along with Lisa Keith. Herb's wife - Lani Hall - sings a duet with Herb on the beautiful ""Pillow"". The other tunes were produced by Herb and friends. Herb does some hot trumpet playing on ""Traffic Jam"" (evoking memories of Miles Davis), ""Cat Man Do"", and the gorgeous ""Our Song"". Contemporary music from a contemporary artist! Good stuff!"
4,All Purpose Fishing Rig,"I have caught more fish, and more variety of fish with this rig than any other fishing method/rig/lure. It simply consists of a sturdy monofilament line, a swivel, a spacer ball, a blade harness, a blade (I prefer red or red and white), and a hook. Baited with a minnow, a worm (crawler), or a leach, I have caught northern pike, walleye, crappie, sunfish, perch, and bass. The only complaint I have with the rig is the swivel is rather cheap. I tie on a more reliable swivel to prevent line twisting. This rig can be casted, but works best with trolling. I use a 1/4 or 3/8th slip sinker weight above the swivel. It catches fish! If all I could have in my tackle box was one rig/lure, this is the one I'd have.Now I've given away my best fishing secret! Hope you have as much success as I have!konedog"
2,I give up,"I seldom give up on a book before finishing, but this one was so disappointing I could not complete it. The characters are mildly interesting, but the plot moves slowly and without much energy. The tale of a terminally-ill man who falls off a cliff - or is pushed - should create many interesting opportunities to explore motive and method, but the book squanders them."
4,Handy device to have in your tool kit.,We are moving part of our network to wireless and find the cables from our switches and hubs in the computer room to the devices and hubs in other parts of the facility are not as well marked as we thought. The tester will allow us to determine the endpoints for our CAT5 cable runs and save a lot of trial and error time.
2,Annoying Batteries,"The probe uses four button batteries. You don't have these lying around the house, so it often happens you can't use it because you can't find the right batteries.The transmitter uses 2 AAA, and one of them needs to go very far into the probe.This unit would be more useful it if used more common batteries."
3,Life Ring,"Got what I paid for, but no complaints. Styrofoam life ring for my pool-side. It's cheap, but functional."
1,Horrible Product and company,"This thing is a piece of junk. It's basically a cheap, useless decorative life ring. It was delivered with dents and dings, and they would not refund shipping either way. I need to remember to order only through Amazon and be careful of these side companies."
4,A must purchase for any student of the American Revolution,"An excellant effort to portay the events and circumstances surrounding this period of American History. This 3 volume set is on par and I believe equivalent to the PBS Series titled Liberty, which I also own. However, this production appears more focused on the military strategies and ensuing battles. Indeed, most of the historians interviewed for the series contain a sound military knowledge. If you want to study the political environment surrounding the American Revolution, purchase Liberty, if your interest is on the major battles of the war, then purchase The Revolutionary War."
1,Not the Kuralt version,"Be warned: This two-hour documentary IS NOT the excellent 6-hour series with the same title that was produced by Carol Fleisher, narrated by Charles Kuralt, and televised by The Learning Channel (TLC). This is a greatly inferior version which is being misidentified as the Kuralt program; I know because I bought it and am now returning it to the seller. It is laughably bad. The TLC Kuralt series is currently unavailable in VHS as of 8/06. As another reviewer here corrected advised, SAVE YOUR MONEY, not to mention your time and trouble, and do not buy this one."
3,Get a clue,"In regards to reveiw one, the narrator for this film is Charles Kurault. The Charles Kurault. Amatuer- I don't think so."
4,I love ridin with Blackie!,"Well, there ain't no put on about this brush popper! he writes it like he rides it."
1,"Item was not delivered, I know the books are great, just want the intended receiver to get them",Somebody please ~ This item was not received. I can't find a way to contact anyone at Amazon.com to tell them it was not received. If you monitor these comments please get this to somebody that can help me. Ellie
5,More than expected!,"Was looking for a USB female plug that was surface mount, and tough. This item turned out to exceed my expectations. The screw on water tight, cap keeps the USB port clean! Will be using this on more custom builds!"
5,for the intellectual food lover,"I am a professional cook who has an expansive collection of cookbooks and food magazine subscriptions, and Gastronomica, without a doubt, is in a class by itself. It's a magazine that relishes all aspects of food culture, from indepth explorations of particular cuisines to quirky analyses of fun foods. Topics as diverse as coca-cola, Vietnamese pho, the parrot eaters, egg creams, irradiated foods, tea drinking, and the all-American butter cake are just a few of the always interesting, usually provocative, and oftentimes entertaining articles you'll read.This offbeat, classy magazine is for the thinking food lover. What a treat!"
4,Funky trippy beats,"well, I don't know how I managed to miss this one for so long .... and the previous two discs are apparently even more groovy. As the summary says, it's funky & trippy & goes well with Air, Daft Punk, and all those good Franco' thangs."
1,I was rather disappointed,"I'll admit up front that I haven't taken the A+ exam yet. However, I won't be using this software to help me finish up my studies.First of all, the interface is not very flexible at all. You go through the pre-tests, but they're the same pre-tests every time, and you have no opportunity to see exactly which questions were missed, and what the right answers were.Second, the questions in the pre-test are not always covered in the accompanying modules.Third, the structure of information is not very well laid-out. As a teacher myself, I understand that in order to teach a topic you must first lay fundamentals and then build upon those. The narrative text makes references to concepts that haven't been covered without explaining what it means.Overall, I was rather disappointed in this software and have taken advantage of the ""30-Day Money-Back Satisfaction Guarantee"" that came with my copy."
1,Worst thing ever,"First off I thought I would be getting a book when I purchased the product, little did I know that all I was getting was a CD-Rom and a t-shirt. This box set is out of date. In the training it states that the latest and newest type of RAM available is SIMM RAM, which has been completely phased out over the last few years. This ""trainer"" is completely outdated and covers hardware that is now utterly obsolete. I cannot express my dismay enough. Be assured I will be returning this product."
3,"""The White"" in a day.","I bought this book when it first became available, and have just now read it. It took one day for me to finish, and I am not bragging, it was just that I could not put the book down. A very simple story. For me, it is a part of history that I had never heard of. I looked up some information on the actual Mary Jemison after finishing the book. No heavy, hard DHM (deep hidden meaning) here. Girl gets kidnapped, girl learns to live with her situation, girl turns out OK. Very simple. She became comfortable with her ""adopted"" family. She did what so many of us have to do in our lives, take what we have been dealt and move on. Find the positives and enjoy what we can."
3,Enjoyable.,"This was a very easy & enjoyable book. I love historical fiction and truly looked forward to reading this book but,(here comes the bad part)... when I finished it I felt like I had eaten my soup, and salad but never got the main course. It was not a satisfying read. I think it needed more character development, and descriptions. I think it could have been a lot better."
1,Huge disappointment!,"I work in a library and have read other books about Mary Jemison. I was really looking forward to reading this book. It was quite a disappointment. I borrowed this from our Main Library since my branch's copy hadn't arrived yet--boy, am I sorry I wasted the Library's money! I think it was half the style of writing and half lack of information. Not very entertaining at all. If other poets write fiction like this, I'm not going to even try to read them!"
2,No Depth,"""The White,"" seemed more like a broad overview, rather than a novel that one can get into. The characters are never really developed and emotions are not really discussed, so it is very difficult to get into these characters or feel anything really for them. It goes from one scene to another without making one get any sort of sense for it, before moving on to something else. I really didn't care for the book and took nothing from it."
3,Could have been a much better book,"What a great story idea - but the author should remember, the genre is PROSE, not poetry - it tries too hard to be poetic, at the expense of the story and the characters."
1,Uninteresting and bland,"I had heard of this book before, but never got around to reading it until now. I honestly wish I hadn't read it at all. I feel as if I'm reading through this book and not really taking anything away from it at all. You don't get a sense of who the characters are as people, or really even care who they are. They're just sort of...blah and bland, as if they mix in with the story somehow, but don't really have a purpose. Especially with the main character, Mary Jemison, even after she's witnessed her family killed before her eyes, she's just portrayed as so BLAND throughout the entire book, it's like, ""How am I still reading this?"" And while reading, it's like there's no real structure for how much time has passed from certain periods in Mary's life, it's all ""boom, boom, boom, here's what's going on. The end.""Overall, I haven't really learned anything significant from this book, nor taken anything from it. Pretty pointless."
5,Best of a work in progress,"Third of five, this is the one he needs to be remembered for, not Lady in Red. Romantic and fun, Living on the Island, but with a touch of tech (Man on the Line, Sound of the Gun). Great Album, a must have for anyone who likes Chris's music"
5,A masterpiece,"""The head and the heart"" is possibly one of the most beautiful, haunting songs I have ever heard. The music and lyrics create the perfect image of someone struggling between love and reason. Chris De Burg is never dull or predictable, but I think this is by far his best creation."
5,This was the first Chris's album I heared,This was the first Chris's album I heared. But it opend the magic world of his lyrics. Maybe it's not his best album but for me ... Moon light and Vodka - you got to hear this ! Dima.
4,"Very good, very solid re-telling of the Batman's beginnings","For the casual comics fan (of which I am one) this is a great introduction to Batman. Miller's re-telling creates solid characters out of Bruce Wayne and Gordon and introduces us to the dark world of crime that Batman is out to combat on a nightly basis.I wasn't terribly fond of the introduction of Catwoman - I much prefer the introduction of super-criminals that the movie ""Batman Begins"" presented, but that is neither her nor there.Bottomline - this is solid escapist entertainment. Well-drawn and well-presented. I give this one a grade of B+."
3,Dull,It might've been a great story when it was first written - but I don't think it stood test of time. It is a retelling of what everybody knows anyway. Miller does good storytelling but that doesn't help when the story is weak.
1,"The Citizen Kane of comics: praised for historical importance, but boring","I'm ready for the negative comments, but for young readers, lovers of Batman's detective work, and those who want a great plot - this is a DUD.The visuals are outdated for today's readers - no, they're NOT 'classic,' they're dated. So you want some insights into humanity or a plot with great twists; this has no twists and no insights - it is a stylistic exercise PERIOD.No mystery to solve, like The Long Halloween.So if art, the World's Greatest Detective aspect of Batman, a great villain, and a clever plot AREN'T important to you, this is useless.BUT it is historically important and sets a tone some readers like, so there is a vague duty among critics to talk it up. But be honest: not much actually happens. Batman: The Animated Series actually has better plots, and their very first episode is (in part) a takeoff on this story, but with many more elements. Skip the hype, or read it first in the library, trust me."
1,Style over substance...,"Frank Miller continues his ""one trick pony ""act by giving us more style over substance nonsense. If you go to every film that Hollywood releases cause its new, then this is for you. Enjoy!"
1,It totally sucked. I'd give it 0 stars if I could.,"A friend suggested this book to me. I have always been a great fan of DC comics, especially Batman. This account of the Dark Knight's earliest adventures completely disappointed me. Even the binding of the book was bad. The pages ripped out of the book at such a rapid rate that I could barely read it in order. But even that didn't matter. The story was so terrible that it was the same even if I read it backwards. The art was so bad, I didn't even know whether it was comic book art or a collection of picassos(no offense to expressionist art). I expected more from this creative team. but now I will never read any Batman story again. Frankly, I would rather watch an infomercial"
1,HEY FRANK......STICK WITH SIN CITY....NOT BATMAN,"wow. where do i begin. this story is basicly terribal. its poorly drawn, stupid looking..and batman is barley in it. you want the orgin of batman, watch beings. im not badmouthing frank miller...Sin City is an amazing book series as well as a great movie...but all he did was make batman dark..witch is realy cool and i def appreciate that..but the book itself isnt that good. i recomend. The Killing Joke. HUSH. The Long Halloween. A Death In The Family..etc.XrosesbleedingX-aim...feel free to coment"
2,Cliched characterizations and over-the-top noir do not make a good Batman story,"Frank Miller's Batman: Year One is an unnecessary and over-the-top retelling of Bruce Wayne's first years as Batman. It has not aged well. Frank Miller's apparent obsession with seediness and prostitutes carries over here, with Selena Kyle portrayed as such. Obvious caricatures of pimps, corrupt policemen and the mob ooze cliched dialogue while the story overall reads like generic noir. The book is saved by David Mazzuchelli's beautifully dim and realistic artwork."
4,Gorgeous,"The perfect start for someone just getting into Batman comics, or graphic novels in general. It's a thrilling, wonderful read that definitely draws the reader in emotionally. It is also very clear how much this influenced Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. A must-read for any Batman fan."
4,Better than The Dark Knight Returns,"I am not an avid comic book reader but I have just started to get into graphic novels. I started with The Dark Knight Returns and was disappointed - I thought it was way too hyped. I understand and appreciate it's impact on how comic books are written, but I just didn't enjoy it.However, I loved Batman: Year One. Very dark, very interesting - a great read. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys Batman or enjoys superhero movies, but feel stupid reading comic books - trust me, it's not what you expect."
5,Batman: Year One,"I have to say that this is amazing. Frank Miller does an awesome job of portraying batman/bruce's fears and faults within the first year and the artwork really pops. not to flashy or colourful, but not dull and neutral either. A most enjoyable read"
5,Best Comic Ever!,"This is absolutely my favorite comic series book of all time. It's amazing! Frank Miller is a genius. If you're a fan of the new Christopher Nolan/Christian Bale Batman series, this is a must read. It's beautifully drawn as well."
4,"not quite as good as dkr, but close","the only real problem i had with this book is that it didn't fully explain why bruce wayne became batman, but it rather showed how. i think the movie batman begins does a better job of showing the beginning of batman. it was till a very good book with great artwork."
5,The Beginning Of A Legend,"You know, it is sometimes hard to catagorize comic books as works of literature. But Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli pulled it off with ""Batman: Year One."" How can I put it? This IS Batman. Who he is and how he came to be. But Miller also explores the early career of a Lietenant James Gordon. And like I stated earlier, it is concocted in such a way that it rivals with many novels that I have read. There are no corny lines or stereotypical cliches here. There is only solid story telling, incredible art, and touching characterization. And there is no sign of Joel Schumacher anywhere."
3,Highly rated but in reality..,I'm not a graphic novel aficionado by any means. I read a bunch of them as a kid and Batman has always been my favourite. Now that I'm all grown up and I make my money I thought it would be cool to add a few titles to my bookshelf. I bought this graphic novel because it was highly rated by critics but in reality it's a story you already know because of all the Batman media that has been released since this novel. In that sense it was probably game changing when it was released but because you already know the story it's really not as gripping as say Miller's Dark Knight Returns.Bottom Line: It's a good book to have as a collector but if you want entertainment you might be disappointed since it's too predictable for you. Evetually you would probably buy this one but if you are wondering if graphic novels are the thing for you look at some of the other Batman books first...
3,Dark origin (?),"I am a big fan of Frank Miller and his style of writting, this book is no exception. A very noir-stylished story telling yet another origin of the caped crusader. It's a grweat book, entertaining, but not as half as good as they praise it to be. Yes Miller is a great author and the best at what he does but this is not the ""watchmen"" it is compared to. Great art, great concept, not enough grittyness and dark themes that Miller has accustomed me to so."
4,Totally recommend this book,"This is a really good book to pick up, especially if your just getting into Batman. There's not much else I can say about it other than its a really good way to tell the beginning story of the most dark vigilante of all time. But I can also see if your already into Batman that this could bore you, but I still liked it."
2,A bit boring for a non-comic book reader,"I like Batman, I like Sin City, so I should like this. But I was just bored. Now, I'm not much of a comic book reader, so maybe that may have something to do with it. I think the main problem is that this felt like it should have been called Gordon, Year One, Batman almost takes a back seat. At least it's a quick read."
2,Disappointed Batman Fanatic,Frank Miller returned to the Batman franchise in 2007 in what I feel to be one of the most disappointing Comic Book titles within the Batman franchise. Batman: Year One although is good in concept of covering Batman's first year as a crime fighter this novel had high aspirations but fell flat on a story that fails to grab the reader.
2,Over-Hyped,"Only four issues long, this is meant to tell the story of Batman's formative year. I went into this riding high on the wave of adulation for this work and came away feeling cheated and like I'd gotten screwed with my pants still on. There are some inspired moments but mostly I was asking the question, ""Yeah, okay, interesting - but when's the freaking story gonna start??!"" Its not enough to say ""It's Millar, shut up"" or ""Its untouchably masterfully brilliant!!"" cos it really isn't. Compared to other Batman stories - basically anything Denny O'Neill wrote, Venom, Long Halloween, Hush etc - Year One falls down. Over-hyped with some good ideas but no real payoff."
4,"""Year One"" is an awesome start to the saga of the Dark Knight","A great read, combined with Miller's signature noir artwork, combines for an excellent Batman read. I even liked it just a little bit more than The Dark Knight Returns, which is considered his masterpiece."
5,awesome book tells batman's first year brilliantly,"this book is awesome! not only is the artwork by mazzuchelli amazing, but the story is expertly told through not the batmans eyes but by jim gordon's eyes. all in all 5 stars for an awesome book"
4,Batman Year one,This comic was pretty good. It focuses on Batmans methods as he first becomes a crime fighter also introduces catwoman(this time she is black and she is a dominatrix hooker hmmmm) The art is maybe and acquired taste. A good read especially if you are truly a comic book fan
5,THE Origin Of The Batman,"Frank Miller put together the best re-telling of the beginnings of Batman. From the death of Bruce Wayne's parents, all the way through his first tenuous year as a crime fighter. You can see where a lot of Batman Begins was inspired by this piece of work. It's the first graphic novel I was ever given, and would make a valuable addition to your collection."
5,As interesting as the Nolan movies,"Had this story been adapted to the first Nolan Batman movie, it would've been just as good. The best part of the book is the way it treats the characters and world as a believable place/people."
5,This Batman at his best,"This is by far the greatest story ever written for such an icon character. Frank Miller's retelling of Batman's first year as a crimefighter is one for the ages. Using the writing techniques that won him such high acclaim during his run on ""Daredevil"", he brought forth Batman as a human being who is capable of mistakes and as with all fallable beings, one who must depend on the help of others in his time of need."
3,The Beginning?!,"I bought this TPB after having read ""The Dark Knight Returns"" and I think most Batman comics would pale in comparison to the depth and sheer coolness of that story. Having said that, ""Year One"" is a good read but I was expecting... more. More exposition on Batman's origins. The new film Batman Begins (which obviously draws on this book for inspiration) showed a more complex and ""real"" version of the Batman myth. I was hoping for something along those lines but it's more like getting a third of that story in comic book form. Very good... but not great."
3,Bruce Payne To Read,"Like a can of Spam; therein lies much ham-fisted dialogue. A re-imagining of the beginnings of Batman with a Lieutenant Gordon and a young and reckless, 18 year old Bruce Wayne. After picking up Watchmen and loving it, I'd figure I would pick up some more adult comic books or ""graphic novels"". This one is inferior in dialogue and art work to Watchmen but it's still a lot better than the Archie comics I'd read as a young boy. The most annoying part is the way Frank Miller had all the dialogue displayed in unusually small fragments, even for a comic book. An example is a scene where Lt. Gordon is trying to save some bag lady from being ran over by a runaway van: ""out of control.-- oh no, not that woman.-- can't let that happen.-- come on you heap move.-- no time.-- can't reach.-- no time.-- it's over.-- i've blown it.--"" Annoying. The target audience might have been the barely literate."
3,Good but not as good as advertised!!,"Most Bat-fans will tell you Miller's Year One is one of if not the best Batman story ever told. I finally got to read it and have to say that while its good, its not anywhere the best. Batman/Bruce Wayne actually plays second fiddle to Jim Gordon who gets treated the best. Gordon comes off as how I have always pictured him in my head. Mazzuchelli's art is very good and much apppreciated over Miller's. Good but not great stuff!"
2,"""That's It?""","Those were the exact words running through my mind upon finishing this underwhelming and meandering story.Jim Gordon is a self-righteous putz, Bruce Wayne is aloof and unremarkable, and Batman is made out to be such an inept klutz in his beginnings that any subsequent heroic feats seem disingenuous, absurd and aided heavily by luck. How one can go from nearly getting his ass kicked by three teenagers to decimating a police death squad after a few months training is beyond me.I know, I know, it is just a comic. Suspension of disbelief is a prerequisite. But if that is the case, then I expect to be entertained and rewarded for my investment. Instead, I read a rather ordinary story framed by cheesy, expository dialogue lifted from a Raymond Chandler novel, sans the wit and social criticism."
4,BOB DYLAN's Guitar player for years!,"Seriosly, This guy played on Dylan's '60's albums. John Can play it like no other! These 2 fine blues style ablums from the 1970's are finally out on cd! - Just in time too, for I have been playing the lp's just a few to many times - I enjoy Hammond from the early 1960's albums of acoustic blues to the 2007 release. Electric or Acoustic blues - John, keep the jams coming & I'll keep supporting it - I love to play 'em all!"
5,Mystrey Maven,"I am hooked on this series by David Roberts. I love the characters and the story lines - there are several - are engaging and challenging. I'd recommend all the Lord Corinth/Verity Browne mysteries to fans of Hercule, Jane and even Morse!"
2,How dumb,"The book is set in 1936 and paints a great picture of life on board the Queen Mary. Everything was fine until the last few pages when the ship arrives in NY and sails under the Verrazano Bridge. Say what? The bridge opened in 1965. You have to wonder how much of the ""facts"" of Queen Mary and shipboard life were made up. I find it horrible that the author made such a blunder with the real facts. Completely ruined the book for me"
5,A Jewel.,"La Tropical is a fantastic effort by director/photographer David Turnley. This moving doc is about predominantly black Cubans and how their musical lives cross at La Tropical, an outdoor dance hall in Cuba.I am a big fan of documentary work, this is one film that held me motionless all the way through to the end credits. What touched me most is its sincerity and photojournalistic vigor, the camera work is superb and the story, told mostly in captioned Spanish, is honest and unflinching during those times when biting truths unfold.My girlfriend had seen this film at the Miami Film Festival when it premiered. I was unable to attend. She spoke so well of this film that I waited over two years to catch it on DVD almost by accident. It has been a long journey to finally see this film but it has lived up to more than I anticipated. Well done."
4,The Palestinian Diaspora,"Hello, I did order this book after I did read the wonderful book ""Mornings in Jenin"" written by Susan Abulhawa. This photographic history was one of the works mentioned at the back of the book. Because I was so overwhelmed by Susan's book I wanted to buy this other book.It's very nice and I am pleased with it.Wit kind regardsRoger"
5,Sure to laugh,"The Chrome CD by Throwing Toasters is one of the best examples of excellant comedy rock. It includes such favorites as ""N.R.L."" and ""DEBBIE"". If you like to laugh, this CD is for you. Go Grant!"
2,Not his best,"There's something funny going on with this music on this CD. It's as if the instruments are playing one thing and vocals are doing another. I've never done drugs, but somehow this makes me feel like I am - as if what I've read about taking LSD or some other type of hallucinogen is true. Perhaps that's what he was on when he recorded it. :-)"
2,Temari book,It came in a timely matter and the price was right. The only problem was that it is smokey-smelly. Very unpleasant odor every time I open the book.
4,a wonderful craft,This is a very good book but not really good for a first timer..the author assumes you know the basic procedures
5,The Craft of Temari,"Of all the books (other than the Japanese) available on this craft, I have to say that this is the best. For those of you interested in, or wanting to create a Temari this book will give you clear, concise instructions along with diagrams and designs to inspire. From easy to the more advanced, and all in colour. Thinking of trying Temari? Then you'll certainly need this book.Enjoy!Ginny"
4,Too short,"This cd is good but it's only half an hour long.Some of the best songs are We Are 138,Last Caress,Cough/Cool,and Return of the Fly. your better off with collection 1.NOT FOR SIMPLE PLAN POSERS"
2,don't buy it,"I don't like collection 2 much at all, except for halloween and we are 138. It looked good until i bought it. Collection 1 kills 2 greatly. DON'T BUY IT!!!!!"
3,a good different collection,"This is a good collection, don't get me wrong but i like ""collection 1"" is better. It still has some good classics though like 138 and one of my favorites last caress. I gave it 3 out of 5 cuz i just think collecion 1 is better. If your deciding which one to buy, buy both of them you will be satisfied."
4,Great Complement to Collection 1,"We Are 138... Hatebreeders... Queen Wasp... We Bite... Last Caress... Good lord, people, what's to complain about? Sure, it doesn't have Skulls or I Turned Into A Martian, or even Bullet, but you should already have Collection 1, so stop yer whinin'. This one is not as good if you don't already have Collection 1, but if you REALLY like the Misfits, you know you gotta have em both anyways, right?"
4,best punk around,"Great cd, that covers material from the Misfits which includes stuff from STATIC AGE to the hardore likes of EARTH A.D."
2,Unconnected items,"While the illustrations are bold and attractive, the book ""Teddy in the House"" consists of seven unrelated items (a block, a banana, a telephone, a cat, a clock and a bottle, plus teddy on the cover), one per page. It's not clear why it is titled ""Teddy in the House"".My six-month old prefers the more complex textures of cloth books such as ""Zoo Faces"" and ""Farm Faces"".Cartuni's review below is, of course, tongue in cheek."
3,Title misleading,"A good book for a 6 month old, but the title was misleading.The only ""Teddy"" in the whole book was on the front cover."
2,only one problem for me........,"First of all love Lucy Cousins' cloth books. They are washable and made with non-toxic inks.The one issue I had was with the picture of a baby bottle. I'm a diehard breastfeeder ;) and personally not too keen on 'normalizing' the bottle. I do know other mothers who feel this way so wanted to make sure that point was made. There's not too much to these books, just some basic pictures so the fact that a bottle is one of them would make me pass on this one.I'd recommend Lucy Cousins' Kite in the Park or Hen on the Farm instead."
2,Faulty,"When I found this product I was ecstatic over its cheap price. However, when it arrived, I clicked it about five times and it broke! Now it clicks only sporadically, which, needless to say, is completely useless for clicker training. I ended up buying clickers from Karen Pryor's website. They cost a dollar each, but operate with a button mechanism, which I like a lot better. So far so good with the new clickers."
3,Good product but shipping is way too high,"I like the product & alone it's a great price and value for $1, but the shipping was 4 times that so I wouldn't order it online."
2,a necessary evil: confusing and out-of-date,"As a current 1L, I know the importance of the Bluebook. After all, we little law students would be lost without the book's citation wisdom.HOWEVER...we also need help interpreting this mess. If the people who wrote this were somewhat organized, the book would not need clarification. Seriously, we as students have our tutors hand out cheat sheets expalining what the Bluebook is really saying.Also, the book is woefully out of date. Electronic sources have flourished while the Bluebook has withered on the vine. There are no references to current online databases, e-mail, or other web-based sources.So, please, rewrite the book in layman's English and update it for the dawn of the 21st century."
2,Essential but Unnecessarily Difficult,"Whatever publisher makes an easy to use reference book for citing legal sources will make STUPID money. This book is NOT it. You *have* to use it, but it is arcane to say the least. Impossible to find an example of exactly what you are looking for. Each state has their own rules for citation, and the guides listed in this book are wrong, at least for Floridian customs. It is very discomforting to know that this is the best source available for legal citations, and it is AWFUL... however... it is MUST HAVE."
1,Another ploy to ensure that the layman must hire an attorney,"I agree that this book is absolutely essential to lawschool or practicing law. That's what makes even more horrible!!! I studied English all through college, and relied on the MLA handbook, which is great!! Why can't the Bluebook people hire the MLA people to come up with a legal reference book that is well-organized and not utterly confusing!! Of course, this review is worthless, b/c if you plan on going to lawschool, working as a paralegal, or doing anything legal, the bluebook is a must have, and there's no way getting around it."
1,Arcane and Escoteric,"Leave it to attorneys to create something so poorly written, confusing and arachaic as The Bluebook. It recently took me 10 hours to write a brief and 4 to get the citations to meet the requirements of the Bluebook. Something is wrong there.My reccomendation to anyone who has to do legal citation is buy the software program CiteIt!. It does everything but write your brief, and makes this book obsolete, something that should of happened a long time ago. Using this product I could of cited my brief in 10 minutes."
2,Hint: read the other reviews with grain of salt,"I agree that this a terrible book: terribly useful and terribly written.I am through my 1L write-on ordeal, and I think I'll make the cut so I'm stuck with Bluebook (now the 18th edition) for another two years. From what I understand practitioners follow their court's rules and the courts are in revolt against the Bluebook.The rule is: be consistent. If you want to know what do consistently choose ALWD (ALWD? imagine what would happen if you let non-elitists write a style manual).Yes we're stuck with Bluebook if we want to get published. But if enough of us use ALWD every chance we can then this will eventually change or the Bluebook will get real--I don't care which."
4,worked great for awhile,"This toy is pretty durable and lots of fun. But it died exactly on his one year old birthday, I have tried 3 different sets of batteries too. Elmo no longer sings or anything, he was knocked over a few times while my kids were doing the hokey pokey with elmo and my baby has toppled him over a few times getting to excited while Elmo was talking. I don't think the toy can take the abuse of being knocked over more than few times. The last few times he worked before I tried changing the batteries he didn't move as well and his singing was distorted. I'm assuming something got broken inside. The toy was fun while it lasted and did do ok considering a lot of use to last at least a year.If your kids are hard on toys or you think Elmo will be dropped or knocked over a lot I suggest a different toy or at least be prepared to replace it a few times."
3,Kinda Boring,It's a really cute toy but my daughter got this last year for Christmas and the batteries are still working like I just put them in yesterday!! My daughter is two and it really didn't hold her attention but those couple of minutes on Christmas day last year was the best time her and Elmo ever spent together. (buy the toy but don't expect it to be your child's favorite because it just doesn't really do much)
3,a so so toy,"I bought this toy for my daughter for christmas when she was 10 months old and she really enjoys it, as does my 7 and 3 year old niece and nephew. Its a darling toy, my only complaint is that it has to be on a hard surface to work properly, otherwise when it tries to ""do the hokey pokey and turn yourself around"" he falls down instead. But it is a fun toy that I would recomend to those who have die hard elmo fans like my daughter!"
3,Hockey Pokey Elmo,"My 11 month old daughter received this as a Christmas gift this year. My husband and I LOVE it, but my daughter won't touch it. She's not scared of it, but it does not interest her at all which surprises me because Elmo is her favorite character at sesamestreet."
5,Very Fun for Toddlers,"My 3 year old daughter just got this Elmo for her birthday, and I thought I would get annoyed with it as I do most mechanical toys. But Hokey Pokey Elmo is fun to listen to and really encourages interactivity between child and parent. It's so fun for everybody to get involved. It doesn't teach much other than to dance the hokey pokey, but it gives quality fun time. The ""uh-oh I fell over...please pick me up"" (or something like that) is adorable. The only thing I don't like is that it falls over so much on carpet. But my kids know where to put it so that it works without falling, so it's not much of a problem. I may consider getting other Elmo dolls now that I know how much fun they can be. Cudos to Mattel! :)"
3,Daughter Bored after a day or so....,"Okay... so i basically bought this for me. LOL My daughter LOVED it last christmas, but soon became bored. Its cute when it getts tipped over it says ""Uh oh, can you help elmo up please?"" and then ""Thank you"".All in all it was adorable, but she JUST now pulled it out of her closet. If your child loves elmo defenetly invest in this toy!"
3,ouch!,"The only thing that interests my 2 year old about this toy is the fact that Elmo says ""uh-oh"" everytime my son pushes him over. Instead of listening and watching Elmo do the Hokie Pokie, we watch my son continually push Elmo over!"
5,A Definate must!,"Having purchased this toy, my nephew has had endless hours of fun.You put his left leg in, his left leg out, you do the hokey pokey and turn around... quite how my 6 month old nephew is supposed to do this I'm not sure, perhaps I was maybe looking at the wrong age range. However, it has taught my wife to say please and thank you when she's sitting down and standing up...A great buy, keeps the little 'uns quiet for ages!"
2,Pooped?!,"Did I get it wrong? End of the song Elmo says ""Elmo's pooped"". Yes I understand what that means, but it is totally not proper words for younger kids to learn. I don't like it. Other than that, it works good. No problem at all."
4,Hokey Pokey Elmo a great gift for any VT Hokie fan,We purchased this for our 11-month old for Christmas. It is great - of course Elmo does not sing the entire song however he does shake and move around. It is quite entertaining. It is not plush but it is not supposed to be with all the mechanics. But then again I am very partial to this Elmo because we are Virginia Tech Hokies and anything with the Hokey Pokey is a lot of fun. We play this for our son when we change his diaper. It keeps him entertained. Go Hokies.
2,Gets boring real fast,Don't waste your money...the kids find it funny for the first day..then it ends up at the bottom of the toy box never to be touched again.
2,thrill quickly wears off,"my 2 yo has had it for 2 weeks, and after the first day hasn't picked it up again. This toy is heavy, the mechanical noises are loud and movements jerky. It's not very cuddly and it's hard to carry. An ordinary talking elmo or plain stuffed elmo would probably have gone over just as well. She's played more with creative nonelectronic toys, or electronic toys that play more songs she can sing and dance to. A toy only for the elmo or hokey-pokey obsessed."
3,Child Frightened,"My daughter received this toy as a gift because she loves Elmo and she loves the Hokey Pokey song and dance. She loves the doll but is extremely upset if we turn it on. I don't have a problem with toys that make noise, but this toy is irritating."
3,"Strictly ""display"" value","I was disappointed with the hokey pokey Elmo. His fur is not soft at all and he has zero stuffing in him, making him hard plastic covered with a thin layer of fabric. When I purchased him, I was expecting him to be more along the same lines as Baby Tad by Leap Pad, who is very soft and cuddly, yet electronic and educational. Elmo seemed very fragile to me, although he hasn't been put to the kid test yet, as this is a Christmas present. I tested him out and he only seems to work on a smooth surface, when I tried him on carpet, he fell right over when he tried to put his ""foot in"". He does have the cute elmo voice, which little kids seem to love, and he does spin and do the hand and leg movements, which I'm sure would intrigue any child! Overall, I'd probably only give it 2 stars."
5,Elmo at his best!,"I would recommend this product because to me Elmo never gets old...no matter how long it's been he's always a wonderful friend, if you don't believe me ask my teenage kids :o)"
3,"Elmo is great, but I had to replace him.",I just wanted to let people know that our Elmo also stopped shaking and turning and I contacted Fisher-Price and they are replacing him. My one and two year old kids LOVE him!
4,Good times for kids,"My 2 year old has this and loves it. He's already a huge fan of Elmo, so I'm sure that helps. The toy itself is rather neat since it pretty much does the hokey pokey. Elmo puts in his hand in, his leg in and he shakes all about, then he turns around in a circle. Doesn't work so good on carpet, better on smooth surfaces. The sound it good and lucky for us parents, the song doesn't last too long. If you tip him upside down he says ""whoopsie!"", and something about needing to be turned back upright. Cute toy. My son thinks Elmo is dancing with him."
3,Very loud toy and scarey to my 6-month old,"My 4-month-old daughter cried the first couple times I played this for her. It is very loud (no volume control) so I put it away and brought it out at 6-months. She still cried even when I played it across the room. Maybe at 7 months? It hasn't been used much so I can't rate it's durability. Also, contrary to the writing on the outside of the box, Elmo puts only his arm and leg in and shakes it all about. To say that the entire hokey pokey song can be played at home is misleading at best and false advertising at worst."
3,Can you make him play the whole song?,"The first day I took Hokey Pokey Elmo out of the box, I noticed his arm had a tear in one of the seams. Also, I removed the tab that says it will make him play the whole song but he does not. He only puts in his hand and foot. He does spin on the carpet though. ... BR>Hokey Pokey Elmo never gets to finish his dance anyway, my daughter just keeps knocking him over."
4,Adorable for kids and adults!,I am in love with Elmo! I think I might love him just as much as my 13 month old daughter. She recv'd Elmo for her 1st birthday and she loves him. He is sturdy and snuggly at the same time. I highly recommend this doll.
3,Cute and Fun but NOT Durable!,"We bought this for our 17 month old elmo fanatic for Christmas this year and though he did like it, it is really, really not made for toddler play. We quessed that it was probably not the toughest toy, and allowed only supervised gentle play to try to extend his life, but to no avail.The custest thing was when elmo would fall and say ""Uh, oh, could you help Elmo up please?"" but we only heard it once as after just one minor topple on a carpeted floor he stopped saying it. Now, not even a month later, he barely works, much to the dissapointment of our little guy. We wouldn't reccommend this for use with other toddlers at all. Save your money or get another elmo! Also, he's quite loud!"
3,Hokey Pokey Emlo,"Elmo was in like new condition upon arrival and worked the first 5-6 times (all movements including a full spin ""You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around"") however after that he stopped doing the full spin."
4,elom toy,My son loved elmo and this was great. He was just as described by the details and recieved it just in time.
1,Seriously Displeased,"My daughter fell in love with the babysitter's Hokey-Pokey Elmo and I was thrilled when I found her one of her own new in the box. When it arrived it looked fine, but this morning (Christmas Day) when she opened it it didn't Hokey Pokey, it just stood there and shook. Now it looks like my only option is a refund and if I want that I have to wrestle this busted thing away from my 17 month old with no shot at exchanging it for one that works. Not such a Merry Christmas."
1,Loved it but the love was short lived,"My 13-month old was initially scared of the 'shaky' arms but after 10days, she was fine with it and even started loving the moves. And then she dropped it out of excitement from the couch and thats it. Elmo now doesnt shake or turn around. Its sad really, for a $40 toy to just get pooped after one fall.And oh yes.. it does say 'Elmo is pooped'"
2,Most annoying toy ever created!,"My kids liked it for all of 10 minutes, and then kept getting frustrated because he would tip over while doing the motions to the hokey pokey. It DOES NOT sing the entire song at a time, is very loud, and I certainly didn't see any educational value to it. My brother in law bought it for us as he was trying to find the loudest, most annoying toy in the store, and I think he succeeded in his mission. Unless your kids are huge Elmo fans, I would not recommend this at all."
2,Fun for the first 10 minutes until it broke.,I bought this toy at Walmart for $29.99 for a 18 month old girl. The toy was fun at first until she dropped Elmo only one time. His hand stop moving and his foot. I was very disappointed in the quality of this toy. For 18 months- 4 years this toy should of been much more durable. Kids of course are going to drop it/ pull his arm. I am returning Elmo for a different toy. For the few minutes he lasted he was really fun and she enjoyed the toy. Overall I would not buy this toy nor any kind again.
4,Fun for a time.,"For about six months this was one of my son's favorites. He would make him sing over, and over, and over... After that initial period wore off, Elmo now sits sadly on the toy shelf collecting dust. Realistically, there is only so much you can do with him. He is not cuddly, in fact, he is hard. He tends to fall over easily which my son finds hilarious. He loves it when he says ""whoopsie."" A fun toy but not very practical. It is kind of expensive to be pushed to the side after such a short amount of time."
3,I hate my mother for buying this annoying toy,"Oh my god if there were only words to describe how annoying this toy is!The thing never stops with the hokey pokey. It is also hard as a rock under the fur cover, hardly a cuddly toy for a little kid."
1,defective,"I have received this TWICE and there is no string at the bottom to make him work, Be sure to go to the store where you can check to see if the importmant component i there!"
3,Not for the small trader,"If you like detailed descriptions of every option strategy known to man, then this is an excellent book. I have spent thousands of hours pouring through this book; analyzing and trying many of the numerous strategies. To be honest, I have learned a lot about options, but I have also lost a lot of money. I still trade options. But now, most of my trades are limited to the basics: straight calls, puts, and vertical spreads.After learning things the hard way, I believe that the small investor should focus on a few simple strategies and avoid the temptation to get into the more complex strategies. For some reason, I thought that the more complex,""advanced"" strategies were better than the simpler ones. That isn't true. There is still plenty of money to be made in options without getting overly complex.If, in spite of my recommendation, you are dying to try out some more advanced strategies, then this is the book for you. Good luck!"
5,The Authoratative Reference,"Quite simply, this book is all you will ever need to trade equity options.The fundamentals are clearly explained and each trading strategy is amply illustrated with the help of many examples and associated graphs.If you buy this book and don't understand its contents, then you must infer that options trading is not for you. On the other hand you will learn quickly why options trading puts you at the top of the food chain (75% of option expire worthless, so why buy them when you can sell them?) The only downside to this book is that you come out the other end feeling like an expert in the subject, engendering you with a false sense of experience. One or two trades should put such arrogance in its place."
4,"Dry and boring as heck, but required reading",This book reminds me of most of my old engineering textbooks. Really easy to fall asleep to. BUT... there is truly a wealth of information in here. It would be suicide to trade options without the information in this book. I really liked the analytical no-hype approach to it. I've already built several profitable computer trading tools based on this book.
1,All theory and no application,This is all theory and no application. McMillan's broker states that he loses money and make money from his books. Show us your trades and not the theory
3,"Overall, it's a good book","It's a good book but contains too many useless examples to illustrate some very simple concepts. Sometime I feel the author just wants to fill the volume to meet some kind of volume requirement. Overall it's good introductory-to-intermediate book. I think Bernie Schaeffer's ""The Option Advisor"" is a better choice."
2,A big fluffy book,"Lots of pages to give basic and mostly uninteresting information. If you need an introductory text, this is too long, but may be the best choice out there. Has some useful practical information, but way too much fluff. For example hundreds of pages on spreads, things that you easily can and SHOULD work out on your own to get a good understanding of them.Good to browse if you have no idea what options are."
1,Out dated material,"There was a time when Larry was the only show in town. However, those days are long gone. This book I bought and returned to the store. Too technical, filling space at times.I went to an Omega Research seminar where Larry spoke. The audience actually fell asleep. As I admit did I when Larry droned on. The book does the same it drones on about options with no application.I have to wonder can Larry actually trade or does he make his money from his high priced seminar series. Either the Schaeffer or Fontanills books are easier to follow. I bought both from Amazon at great prices"
4,Pretty good,"After hearing this was simuliar to Full Metal Panic!, I decided to check it out. I was expecting the usually plot.. Teenage kid who is afraid of the enemy learns that he or she has special abilities to save the world.. However, this is not the case. Sure there is a ton of simularities to this and FMP.. but this anime has enough differences to stick out. Instead of just one main character there seems to be several pilots it centers around. I'm looking forward to volume 2."
2,Ingredients as listed on package,"Depends on what you are looking for ... Here are the actual ingredients listed on the package: ""Liquid from coconut blossm [blossom], crystal white sugar, malt sugar."""
1,This is not pure palm sugar,"This product is not pure palm sugar and consumers need to be aware of this. Amazon.com should be required to list the ingredients of all their food products, otherwise consumers don't know what they are truly buying. This Thai Palm Sugar is mixed with white cane sugar and for consumers looking for a pure palm sugar, this product is very deceiving in it's name. There is another palm sugar sold on Amazon.com that is pure, which i suggest for consumers who want an unadulterated palm sugar."
3,Thai Palm Sugar,I have not used this item yet so there is nothing I can say about it ( positive or negative).
3,Sufi not Sufism,"This cd is not in the style or based on (as far as i can tell) the philosphy and religious practice of sufism.It is however a very good downtempo electronic album. With a strong ambiance, interesting rythems and groovy basslines, Sufi puts thier songs together with a simplicity and haunting familiarty that will appeal to anyone who appreciates the soul of music.True spirituality is not always obvious."
5,Great Bullfloat!,This is the best Bullfloat I've ever used. Recommend it highly to all Concrete Pros.
3,Hot Dudes,"The guys are hot, but I am turned off by stupidity. I would rather the men not say anything and that it was just set to music. I usually turn the sound off and turn on nice music."
1,Can I give this negative stars?,I bought this CD because I heard a pretty cool sounding track by Vomito Negro and good lord this is unlistenable. I love just about all forms of music from SPK to George Michael and this is by far the worst CD I have ever come across in my 32 years of life.
1,If the nose knows?,"I received my order and couldn't wait for the first squirt, but when I did I was not happy with the scent. I use it as a scent for fabric softener."
1,Don't EVEN think about it!,The absolute worst fragrance I've ever purchased! I couldn't even make myself TRY to like it! Went straight in the trash! CASE CLOSED! AMEN!
1,"""Bug Repellent"" in a Bottle","Don't even think about buying this ""fragrance"" (if I can call it that?)!!!I've smelled some pretty bad men's fragrances in my time, and this has to be the ultimate WORST! I wouldn't be caught dead wearing this! Mine went in the trash dumpster. I doubt whether it'll even make that dumpster smell good! IT'S THAT BAD!"
1,I cant even rate this cologne its so bad,I read all the fake reviews how fabulous this cologne was and bought this cologne. It smells like old womens perm!!! Worst cologne I've ever smelled. Like wearing a rotten skunk around my neck!!! Great for birth control.
3,pheremone cologne,"at first the scent was strong,but after it settled it was fine ,it was really great. i'll buy more."
5,Together Alone,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was the first book in quite a while that I didn't want to put down. Enjoyed the character development. Would really like to know what happens next to the characters.
5,Excellent Book!,This book was such an inspiration! I couldn't put it down. The characters were so real and so true to life. This stuff can really happen to women today.
2,Flat and steriotypical Characters,"I found I had to put this book down after reading only several chapters. The characters were very flat and steriotypical. The simpering Emily, the sex-starved Celete, the self-absorbed men. Yuk. Nobody very interesting at all in this book.I had found ""Coast Road"" by Delinsky much more interesting with several multi-faceted characters. ""Disappearing Grace"" was also better, but this one seems like a turkey."
4,Almost a Classic,"A near classic text of psychopathy, Aleister Crowley, the beast 666 of Revelations (a psycho himself) delivered this to Cambridge University, where it was promptly banned. It was banned because the subject of the lectures, Gilles de Rais, was a famous and abhorrent child killer. He proclaimed he burned candles made of infant's fat, etc.- one of the worst, if not THE worst I've seen. I got my version from what I guess I now know him as a notorious anarchist, who published anti-government publications such as this. Why this one, though? Do you think he could get away with it if he didn't have money? As far as I'm concerned, Aleister Crowley was a very charismatic leader of a cult, placing him on a level of psychopathy almost on the level of De Rais himself. Becoming involved with any religion is a good way to take advantage of people."
4,Worth it for the title track alone,"The title track is wonderful -- an absolutely great recording. UB 40 has never been better and Herb Alpert (remember him? ) does a great solo on this track (hasn't lost his chops yet!). If you're a UB40 fan, you won't be disappointed with this one."
4,"Just tell it like it is, yeah","My friends and I at Preston and Maxcy Halls at the University of South carolina rocked out on this in the mid 80s. Really upbeat tunes, including the title track, All I want to Do (albeit that once sounds a lot like the Police), Tell It Like it Is, and best of all, sing our own song. Agitpop lovers may be interested in knowing that he latter was an anthem during the anti-aparthied movement at the time. Enjoy."
4,Great Overview,"I thought this was a great overview of the Honeypot and Honeynet mechanisms. In my role as a system artchitect I could probably benefit more from the lessons learned out of specific Honeynet deployments than in how to build and instantiate one myself. But the thought processes one goes through in the deployment of such a mechanism and the tracking of ""hackers"" was extremely informative. I would recommend this book for IT professionals, especially ones in charge of large system deployments, although I think most IT security professionals would find this book too much of a review."
5,great introduction and reference on honeypots,"Honeypots is an excellent introduction to the subject of honeypots, useful as a reference for experts as well as for beginners to the subject. It is written very clearly and provides step-by-step instructions with plenty of examples and screenshots. It covers commercial, open source, and do-it-yourself solutions, from very simple low-interaction detection honeypots to very high-interaction research honeypots. A CD-ROM is included with software and example data collected by honeypots. One defect is a fairly large number of typos."
4,Very helpful,"I bought this to help perform research on a security course that I'm preparing. Even though the information on some of the honeypot programs is a bit outdated, I still found the book very helpful. It's well-written, and gives a very good explanation of how to implement honeypots. It was a tremendous help in my research."
3,just ok,Bucket certainly does not spill but the wands are too thick - you only get a bubble or two before you have to dip the wand back in. Better to use the long skinny wand that comes in the gallon jug you can buy at Target.
2,Average Toy,"Although this toy actually prevents spilling and is pretty durable the problem I had with this toy was that the three wands were not very good at producing bubbles when you blew on it. Also, it's a bit difficult to put the wand in and out of the bucket. It's not very good for little kids."
1,Little kids Messy Bubble Bucket,"When you take it out of the box it is colorful and fun looking, but when you fill it with bubbles it becomes messy with liquid bubbles all over the place. I washed it out and will probably put it in my plastic recycle bin!"
3,read the fine print... this doesnt come with bubbles.,the CONTAINER is fine but i cant believe that I paid that much for a container... i though for sure it would come with bubbles.
3,Just use Gazillion Bubbles bottle and wand,"Purchase this and thought it would be wonderful to be able to have my daughter and her friends use this for 'bubble' time. I am fairly disappointed as I don't really see anything to hype this product. I prefer to use Gazillion bubbles with the included wand. This wand, as pictured, has only one bubble hole; whereas the Gazillion bubble wand is a smaller bottle which fits in my daughter's hands, and the wand has a lot of bubble holes, which creats more bubbles when used. Sorry, but I cannot recommend this product."
4,Works great - Bubbles not included!,"My grandson tipped this over and it didn't leak, I panicked at first, but it does what it promises, no leaks! The wands are a little hard for the little ones to insert and pull out. I assumed that bubbles come with it, it should say in the description that they are not included. Now if only I could find the wands my grandson displaced :-/ I use the ""Miracle Bubbles"" solution which is so-so. Can anyone recommend a solution that results in more bubbles? One of the reviewers blamed the small amount of bubbles on the bucket but I have to disagree. Can anyone recommend a better bubble solution?"
5,Love it!,"I was worried about the other reviews when I bought this but decided to try it for myself. I bought this for my 2 year olds birthday because he can not hold anything the right way!. He has carried this bubble bucket upside down, sideways, dropped it ect and no bubble solution has come out yet. I am simply amazed about its ability to contain the bubbles so I'm not stuck buying gallons of bubbles every month. This makes him happy, it makes me happy and it has 3 wands to make other kids happy too. Perfect. Also, the colors are random and I didn't care too much. I ended up with a cool green color!"
5,Great for playing at the park or with multiple kids,"I have an 18 month old who loves bubbles, but cannot blow them yet. She also insists on holding the wand... so this is perfect for her. She can play with one of the wands and I can blow bubbles without her making a mess everywhere.I am a fairly new mom and brought this to the playground with me and it was a big hit with the kids. It doesn't blow a ton of bubbles per try, but it does allow for multiple kids to play at once. The boys then took the wands and played swords with them later, but it was okay because I at least still had the ONE wand to play with.Great invention- not only are there multiple wands but it doesn't spill!"
1,Such a mess,"Skip buying this bubble bucket. The wands are way too big, soap gets everywhere, and it really just makes a huge mess. Maybe it won't spill but what about the soap on the wands getting all over the floor. I have already thrown it away."
2,Too big for little hands,I bought this for my 2 yr old daughter and her friends.But its too big for her to handle it alone. She has learned to blow bubbles and loves to blow it herself. This product is good for children aged 5 to 8 or higher. Not meant for toddlers. The no spill function is also not really true. A toddler most of the time tends to overturn the whole thing and the liquid leaks out of the bucket. Gymboree has a similar bubble bucket in a smaller size and that seems to be totally no spill no matter how you hold it.
1,No Consequences,"It is my opinion that Mr. Smith has no idea of what a women goes through when trying to deal with an unplanned crisis pregnancy. i have spent a few years in volunteer work with women who did not chose life, but who have worked through the regret and managed to find healing. Real world lives after the choice do not coincide with this fictional pie-in-the-sky outlook. Pieces and parts of the book would give hope to it being useful in the field, but i was very disappointed by the ending. i am not happy about spending money on this book."
1,God's will?,If only things were as simple and straightforward as this title suggests!God's will? Is it God's will when pregnancy is the result of incest? Is it God's will when pregnancy is the result of violent rape? Is it God's will when a women's life is endangered by a pregnancy? God's will indeed!
4,Great Single,This is a good pick to add to your collection. Mixes are pretty cool and if you use shuffle mode on any device it's even better because you get a different variation an already great song.
2,Clamming Up,"These stuffed clams were OK but, nothing great. I do betterlocally or made by me. If you don't want to take your timegoing to your local Fish Monger or making the yourself,The these would suffice as a treat."
2,Stuffed bread with clam flavoring,I was hoping for some clams in the stuffed clams. Instead it was all breading with clam flavor. Very disappointing and very fattening. I bought some snows chopped clams and made my own. They at least had clams!
4,Good reading for at the beach,A book you can read for hours at the beach or just while waiting at the doctors office. I liked the story line. I actually have not completed it yet. I have about 4 chapters to go.
4,Moments of sheer power,"A story that begins with deliberatly switched babies, done to hide adultery, doesn't sound either promising or uplifting. But Eileen Goudge has done it-this reader came to care about those babies as they grew into fascinating, strong young women, and to care about all the tangled familial webs surrounding them. The surprise punch of the story isn't theirs, however, it's the Vietnam vet turned writer, Brian, loved by both young women, as he peels back the platitudes and exposes the raw truths of that long, sad, painful war. His insights into the war's terrors and into the courage of those who were there will remain as a haunting memory long after the romances of this novel have faded. Goudge has a particularly deft hand with the older men in this family saga, as well, offering insights into their stoicism, their shattered dreams, and their willingness to dare to hope again, and to act on that hope. All in all, a terrific tale, with moments of real and rare power."
1,Garden of Lies,I would have rated it no stars if that choice had been available. Didn't even finish it. Boring and depressing.
3,Good read,Good book with interesting characters but a terrible ending. It just fell flat. Norwalk up. Will try another book by this author.
2,Okay. I can't believe all the praise,"While this is an easy to read good soapy drama, there is way too much descriptions of clothes, rooms and wasted thoughts by the characters. I could hardly believe the ending which basically left the book unfinished. The character of Sylvie is not the least bit sympathetic, is materialistic, selfish and totally self-absorbed. How she inspires such devotion is amazing. This author puts together a good story but this book could have been 100 pages shorter without all the unnecessary descriptions. Needless to say after plodding through it, the ending was a total letdown. Not impressed."
5,A truly fun read.,An epic type of romance. Beautifully written. It's a great beach read. I'm now interested in her other books. Enjoy.
3,A little disappointed...,"So, I started to read this book with so much excitement. It kept me going for a while, but I kinda have a problem with how and why the writer all of a sudden created this rift between Rachel and Brian after 6 years of marriage (a rift that conveniently occured all because Rose showed up) all in the name of getting back together with with Rose instead. I give it 3 stars too. Just an ok book."
4,"Great, sad Romance","Wonderful book - loved the story line and the sadness. Book was thrilling, sad, sensual, and just simply a good read. I really couldn't put it down!"
3,A racy read,"Garden of Lies is an anjoyable read with some good set pieces particularly on the Vietnam War. A good mix of characters and plenty of ups and dows in their lives. It starts with the swapping of two babies; One lives in luxury the other in poverty and tells of how they grow up and cope with feelings of displacement. Both love the same man, only one gets him but can she keep him? Worth reading."
5,Garden of Lies,I absolutely loved this book and I recommend it to anyone who likes to read a long novel. The storyline was in detail and kept me interested. I will definitely read the sequel.
5,book review,Great book. Kept your interest. It was easy reading. Using my Kindle in the sun was also a great benefit while I was on vacation.
3,Contrived,"While I did enjoy the character development in this book, the plot was unbelievably contrived. There were too many thoughts of ""what are the chances of THIS happening in anyone's life?"" that took away from what was a great story line."
3,"Less dated than other ""music films"" of the period","Jon Waters plays a rock star past his prime struggling to make a comeback in an era where he's considered a relic. Guy Pearce plays his son, himself a musician, who embraces popular ""new wave"" music and seems to jump from one success to another. This causes a schism between the two as the father's jealousy and frustration mounts.While ultimately predictable, ""Heaven Tonight"" provides sympathetic characters and is really not a bad watch.The strength of the movie lies in the quality of the musical tracks and the fact that the film is far less dated than other ""music films"" of the period. The characters are dressed normally (no yellow spandex pants or bandannas) and the classic rock tracks are really quite good. The new wave songs are bit nostalgic but listenable."
3,OK but not as good as my old one,"It doesn't have multple closure holes (4) on the main body or on the photo/id side as my old worn out one does. There's just one snap hole on each. Only the exterior is leather unlike my old one which both the coin pocket and the photo/id insert were leather. These are vinyl in the new one. I do like the burgundy color, though. It is the closest I could find to my beloved old one also made by Buxton. Buxton just went less extensive on the interior compared to their former product."
2,buxton heiress convertible billfold,"Purchased this to replace my 20 year old ALL LEATHER buxton wallet. Disappointed because the inside of this wallet is vinyl, only the outside is leather. I can't imagine the vinyl change purse area lasting very long compared to an all leather wallet."
3,This Buxton wallet is not the same quality as Buxton used to be.,"I thought this wallet was exactly like the Buxton wallet I was replacing for my mother. It looked like and was described as the same, even the embossing on the snap closure is the same. This wallet is advertised as ""soft leather"", but only the outside of the wallet is leather. The inside of the wallet, coin section, picture section, credit card section and folded bill section are all a very thin, cheap plastic. It's a shame that the wallet is not all leather. It will never last like the former Buxton wallets have. It would have been nice to know that the inside of the wallet was not leather."
4,One Of Their Best,"Spatkle In The Rain is one of the best albums by Simple Minds. It does remind you of U2 to a certain degree with the production, but the songs are excellent or even great. Others have commented that this album starts their decline as a band but I disagree. This album and New Gold Dream is what I would suggest for the uninitiated"
3,simple minds: the cocaine mix,"coming afternew gold dream, this album was a nasty shock. it sounded like steve lillywhite had mixed the thing with his nose full of cocaine: everything was turned up to 11 (appropriate given 1984 was also the age ofspinal tap). the distortion was appalling after the clinically clean recording ofnew gold dream. if this had been my first exposure to simple minds, i'd probably love it as much as the rest of the reviewers but it wasn't & i don't.sons & fascination/sister feelings callwas the first (packaged & resequenced from two vinyl records - actually started with the lp of ""sons & fascination""),new gold dreamthe second. the release ofsparkle in the rainwas eagerly anticipated & was instead a terrible let-down. it was the beginning of the end. then jim kerr got it into his head that he wanted to be the scottishbono. then came that abysmal hit single that wasn't even written by the band. then mick macneil & his synthesizers quit.i rapidly lost interest."
4,Up On the Catwalk...,"... is *incredible* in concert, and this disc (and several other tracks) bring back memories of an under-rated band playing very, very well. There's a whole lot more to Simple Minds than ""Don't You Forget About Me""."
4,First Four Songs Are Incredible,"The songs on this record are in general excellent, but the first four are classics -- four of the greatest songs recorded in the 1980s: ""Up on the Catwalk"", ""Book of Brilliant Things"", ""Speed Your Love to Me"" and ""Waterfront"" are incredible and the record is worth getting for these tracks alone."
1,Terrible service- don't recommend buying from here.,"I bought a box of these, excited that I would finally get to try the infamous candy cigarettes but the sender sent it to the wrong place- it had been delivered and I received the confirmation email but the mail-room that should have received it had no packages for me. I emailed the seller that I never got my package and they apologized for not being able to help me because according to their records, it was received. A few days later, I found the package, delivered to the wrong place- the sender told me they couldn't mail it to me again if it was sent back to them because it ""wasn't covered"" in the money I spent buying the candies. Terrible, TERRIBLE customer service- if it's they're fault, they should take responsibility for it."
3,IT'S OKAY,I received my shipment sooner than expected but was disappointed when my grandson opened the candy cigaretts and found that many were broken.
2,"Arrested By You, another choice.",If you want this soundtrack mainly for the track Arrested By You you would be better listening to Dusty Springfields REPUTATIONS & RARITIES album. She does a lovely version!
1,WHERE'S HOJO? WHERE'S VAN HALEN?,"This CD is missing two of the most prominent tracks from the film...I actually felt like I was on Candid Camera when I first held it in my hand, I couldn't believe they weren't included. However, Arrested By You is on there...beautiful song...unfortunately, if this CD didn't sell well...we all know why."
3,help,"whats up fellow nerds...Of course let me agree by saying this is a classic flick, and one of my all time fav's...One of you has to be able to help...The song im looking for is in the scene when our hero is in the bathroom with the q-tips...i thought it might be sinatra, but i cant find it...help!"
3,Missing Songs,"Better Off Dead is a great movie and one of my favorites.I bought this CD mostly just for the songs One Way Love and Arrested by you- which are two of my favorites on this CD. I was disappointed and surprised that the songs ""Everybody Wants Some"" and ""I'd Like to get to Know you Well"" arent on there at all. The songs on the cd are still okay. But its disappointing they didnt put two of the best songs on the cd"
5,This Movie Rules,"If you like this movie, you'll love the soundtrack. I only wish they had soundbites like ""You make a narley run like that and girls will get sterile just looking at you"". But, you've got to take what you get. Highly recommended."
3,Missing Most Important Track,Apart from missing Howard Jones and Van Halen the most important piece is missing I'm talking about Muddy Waters Mannish Boy played as the Camaro is finally rolled out of the garage.
5,"This is a great movie and soundtrack,BUY IT!!",This is probably one of my favorite movies and sountrack of all time. The movie is hilarious and the soundtrack is awesome. Put the movie and the soundtrack on lists of things to get.
1,This is AWFUL !!!,"As a David Sylvian fan, I was attracted to what I had heard about this band, and frankly I am horrified. There isn't a single melody on this album that comes close to any of Sylvian's efforts. The singer's voice is awful, the soundscapes are dull. What a waste of money. I'm throwing my Blue Nile CD in the bin."
4,mesmerizing music,"The Blue Nile were one of the 1980s more ""under the radar"" bands. Great music that never reached the masses. Then again, maybe that's for the best, or they would have ended up sounding like Simple Minds. Not that that's bad, but this album and their one, ""Hats"" were splendid sets of mesmerizing, soothing, reflective, and inspiring songs. Keyboards and synthesizers blended together like a delicious, sweet confection. I still like ""Hats"" a bit more than this debut, but that's just a personal bias. Nothing remotely mediocre about this album whatsoever. Songs like ""Tinseltown in the Rain"" and ""Stay"" still sound powerful nearly 30 years after they were released."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK ...,"You will be very unhappy with this book. Here is an example of why: Recipe for ""Mac and Cheese""1 box macaroni and cheese.1 stick butter1/2 cup milk.Are you kidding me!!!"
1,books without pictures,"The book has no pictures. Unfortunately, it is impossible to get this information when you purchase in Amazon."
2,"Stylish maybe, but not very Egyptian","Most of the photos here are from only a small number of locations -- mostly tourist hotels or homes owned by foreigners or wealthy Arabs. Because of this, the style depicted isn't terribly Egyptian, but sort of a quasi-orientalist fantasy. Virtually all of the interiors in this book could be from Morocco, or Los Angeles for that matter. Still, it's well-produced, inexpensive, and worth a look if you're more interested in style and less in authenticity."
3,True Women movie was good but not like the book,"After reading the book and watching the movie, I have to say the book is muchbetter, goes over so much more of the family timeline and is more true to the facts.The movie seems to distort the facts to heighten interest and to fit the televisionformat. The movie was good, but changing the facts seem to make it less thanaccurate. Reading the book gave so much of the back story that I think is necessary.One good thing it does is that it does bring characters to life. I think the castingwas very good as I had started the book first and was picturing characters muchlike these. Details like the river flowing in the wrong direction and Euphemia andGeorgia knowing each other as children, led to the confusion."
5,True Women,"An excellent story of two pioneer families, and the women in these families, who endured and survived many trials and hardships while attempting to make a home in the untamed wilderness."
4,True Women,"Excellent movie, I have watched it several times over the years & finally bought it. Excellent service by Amazon.comDon"
5,TRUE WOMEN,arrived very quickly. It was in excellent condition. Would definetly buy from this seller again.
5,"""True Women"" tells it true","My wife and I first watched ""True Women"" as the mini-series on TV. It was so well done and informative that we wanted the DVD as soon as we found it. The film portrays many of the problems of the era from before the Alamo through women's sufferage in Texas. It also fairly represents the strength of Texas women."
2,Fun movie - but historically inaccurate,"I felt the cast of this movie portrayed their characters quite well (if a little on the melodramatic side), however, I could not get past all the historical inaccuracies. I am not a native Texan, but I know the history of this time period and this area well, and know that this movie takes quite a few liberties with how things actually happened. I have not read the book and do not know if the inaccuracies were the film maker's attempt to make things more dramatic, or if the flawed portrayal of this time period is reflected in the novel as well (I hope not). Historically inaccurate movies are always a disappointment because they misrepresent the events of their given day and time, and make people believe that this is how things actually took place. Considering the stellar cast that was involved in this film, it is a shame that the story told was not the ""real thing"". Perhaps, someday, they'll get it right."
1,TOO BAD>>>>>>>>,It really is too bad that this movie ended -- with NO ending - this movie had great potential to be a good western - about the life of the women in the frontier but you get to the end and have no resolution about any of the women - you are lead to believe a certain fate for two of the women but never get to really know and they completly forget about Georgia - i would not recommend this movie to a western lover it will only dissapoint you
3,"Historically accurate? I think not, but still fun...","Nothing about this TV movie can really be described as accurate, but it is fun. The story is choppy; it skips around; it bends history; there is a wonderful part where the women are fighting for the right to vote, which they fail at, but the movie never bothers to tell the end of that particular thread. This is an awesomely bad TV movie that came on television when I was younger and I remembered loving it far more than I actually did.It gets an B for a guilty pleasure, but after that nothing else."
1,Flawed history and unrelenting misery,"I tried to like this movie, but I could not get past the historical inaccuracies and the unending tragedies that are heaped upon the women in this tale. I had hoped for a good western showing women victorious in their efforts. Instead the women are portrayed as heroines simpy because they were victims. If you get burned, slaughtered, widowed, raped or hung, you are a true woman, as if suffering defines a woman...what drivel. And racial issues are reduced to tired old cliches in the hands of the feuding friends. Surely this chapter of American history, and the role of women of the era could have been treated with a bit more intelligence. Or, barring that approach, the film could have been turned into a tongue-in-cheek western with women a-whoopin' and a-hollerin' their way across the plains...a sort of girlie version of ""The Magnificent Seven."""
5,1st reference for unusual items,"I keep this book at my desk, as it is an excellent resource for almost any unusual furnishing or finish. Descriptions are clear with B&W; illustrations for many of the more interesting items. Where else will you find a ""gueridon"" listed?I heartily recomend this book.TeriProfessional ID in Baltimore"
1,"BAD PRODUCT, MAXI-MATIC IS A BAD COMPANY","Don't waste your time with this company. They sell low quality. Mine quit working the first time I tried to use it. They will not honor their warranty. They will not even respond to a warranty request via email or through their website. You will always get that there is ""no one available"" if you call their customer service. AVOID their products."
1,I would give it 0 stars if possible - BEWARE!,"I bought this rice cooker at my local grocery store. It's the perfect size for making rice for just two people, and I really like the ""Cook / Warm"" simple rice cookers that do their job and do it right. However, you should NOT waste your money on this product.First of all, the cooking pot is NOT non-stick, so a layer of rice is always glued to the bottom when it's done.Second of all, I, like many others, once detected the smell of burning plastic while the rice cooker was cooking away. Suddenly, the ""Cook / Warm"" lights went totally black, and it stopped working. For good.This was literally my third use of this product.Beware this piece of junk. Don't waste your money, because you'll just be throwing it away for a product that simply does not work."
1,THE WORST APPLIANCE I'VE EVER BOUGHT,"First, as soon as it's plugged in it powers on. Second, following the rice recipe in the manual ALWAYS ends with scorched rice. Third, it smells like burning plastic while it burns your dinner. There's no timer on this cooker--so I couldn't turn my back on it out of fear it would burn down my house. Is this some kind of device unleashed on the American public by a foreign government to make our cooks seem unfit? Pure cr@p. Don't buy this."
1,Worst small appliance ever owned,"Bar none, the worst small electrical appliance I ever owned (I am middle aged). After a month, the top fell apart and the inside lining melted off. The off and on switch and spring mechanism under the pot stopped working. Steamer part turns rice green. A gummy residue is left on the counter after you cook rice. I like an appliance that gave me an electrical shock better than this."
2,"Wow, it's small!","I ordered this and received it today. All I can say, is WOW, it's smaller than I thought it would be. It scorched the bottom of the rice, too. I do like it because it does take up less room. But, I probably will go back to my old faithful Hitachi. I've had that one for over 20 years."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,I'd give -5 if I could. Worst rice cooker ever invented. The company should be sued. It cooked 3 batches of rice then it started to smell like burning plastic and stopped working. Save your money for a different brand.
1,The worst rice cooker ever made,"This rice cooker is absolute junk. It stopped working after a month. The guaranty is a joke. Maxi-matic request you pay all the shippings, so it is cheaper to buy a new rice cooker and put this piece of junk where it belong: the trash bag."
1,The poor reviews are true,"I bought this one to replace a model that had a different name on it but was suspiciously identical in looks as this one. The last one I had worked 2 months. (We cook a lot of rice in our house, at least 4 times a week.) This most recent one I got that had the name ""Elite"" on it lasted about 3 months. One day they work fine, the next no light turns on, and it doesn't heat up anymore. How dumb I feel for buying the second one. But I figured it was cheap and surely the first one was just a fluke... Still, you don't expect a rice cooker to be disposable!! No matter how cheap, it's not worth the trouble to have to go out and buy a new one every 2 or 3 months. Ridiculous!!"
2,For the junky,"This is a collection of mostly shareware produces that require payment for full funcionality. There is alot of freeware also. Hard to navigate in the ""Dashboard"", wish it had screenshots.Seller sent item out on time and was delivered on the date promised."
3,"time crunch, moderate workout","This workout is great for those who are both short on time (only 40 minutes) and don't want an intense workout. It has most the major body areas covered and it uses weights (of course not provided) and their ""step"" throughout, giving you the option for improving your strength over time. This Firm video employs their classic and effective mixture of aerobics and weight training. This one, unlike some of their earlier works, has pretty mild aerobics sections. Overall, this video could be an easy introduction to the Firm or just starting an at home workout regimen."
2,Easy Does It,"I have exercised with tapes for many years and found this particular one to be too easy. I also did not realize that you had to have the right equipment to use the tape effectively. I did not have the ""bench"" that the tape suggested you use and was not told ahead of time that I would need it.This may be a very good tape for those just starting to use weights and beginning to do low impact aerobics. The instructor looked so muscular that I am sure she is doing other exercises and using heavier weights to have such defined muscles."
3,Not for beginners,"Great video for those who are fit and have dance experience. Not for beginners, those who have two left feet or are out of shape."
5,well worth buying,"I have all of the firm series of exercise videos & quite frankly was discouraged because I just couldn't do them! But when the Firm Basics series came out, I figured I'd give them one more try - and I am soo very glad that I did. I purchased all three, and have been using them for just over one month. You will get a serious workout & you will see results in ten workouts - I began to feel a difference after seven - one workout every other day."
5,Excellent Beginner Tape,"I bought this as my first Firm tape, after reading the comments of the many different Firm videos. At first I was worried that the ""basic"" work out would not be hard enough (even though, at age 22, I do not work out often). Boy was I wrong! This video was exactly what I needed. The work out is fun and goes by quickly. I have been using the video for three weeks now and weight 8 lbs less (only 20 more to go!). I am back at Amazon now to buy another Firm video.If you want to know about the length of the video and how much time is spent on abs, floor work, warm up etc. check out the web site, but order the videos from Amazon.com because it is cheaper (both the video and shipping and handling)!"
2,Stability issues,"The WLI-TX4-G54HP works fine, when it works. I've owned it for over 2 years but only used for short periods of time. Recently, however, I've been using it in a permanent installation and it rarely works for more than a few days at a time without requiring a reboot. Wireless coverage is good to excellent where it is located, so it shouldn't be having problems. I'm also careful to use a free frequency channel. It finally stopped connecting wirelessly altogether. So then wired it in so I could check the settings, and that worked for all of one minute and stopped before I could even do anything. Now it won't connect to anything wired or wireless."
3,WEP 128 Does Not Work,"Wrestled with the device for some hours, using WEP128, before calling Tech. Support - who suggested that I disable encryption to verify connectivity with the router. Sure enough, worked fine in infrastructure mode with encryption disabled. WEP64 also worked, but unfortunately WEP64 is not suopported on my MacBook Pro.Agree with the other reviewers that the 802.11g manufacturers are not getting their products 'right'. Appears to be minimal testing/QA effort on their part prior to shipping the product..."
4,Good if you have ethernet and no wifi,"We bought this on recomendation from our local ""free wifi"" provider. It supposedly could pick up a signal from a greater distance than the built in laptop wifi receiver. The range did seem to be a little greater, but it still wasn't enough to get a reliable signal. (The wifi company seemed to have other issues and is no longer doing business around here.)This ""reverse"" hub seems to be pretty reliable. The multiple ports could allow many different devices to be plugged in. However, these days devices seem to be leaning more towards wifi over ethernet, so I don't anticipate a lot of need for this device.My one complaint was that the antenna had a tendency to disconnect. It would snap right back in to place."
3,Poor technical support,"For the most part, the product works as advertised. However, there is an incompatibility problem with Netgear's Storage Central box (SC-101). The technical support at Buffalo had me jump through hoops to help them diagnose the problem. Finally it was escalated to Level 2.The level 2 tech support just shrugged it off and said they'll look into it. They never got back to me."
5,Awesome wireless performance,"I use two of these as WAPs running off a Xyzel MIMO router. My setup is rather unusual, since the router is connected to a variety of game consoles, and my desktop is connected to one of the Buffalo AirStations. The other one provides internet access to a ReplayTV unit in a remote corner of the house. I have 3Mbps cable internet, and they certainly don't hinder the speeds I'm getting while browsing or playing online games. For over two years these have AirStations have performed without complaint or reboot (aside from the odd power failure). They never need attention. Heck, half the time I forget I even have them. For a plain WAP they're a bit on the expensive side, but you get what you pay for."
5,Been waiting for this device for years,Buffalo really pulled it off with this device. It works just as advertised. Easy setup (read the card!) and the WPA encryption worked flawlessly. The speed is great and I have had no drop-outs. Thanks for a great product!
4,Amazed with Performance,"I bought a used airstation turbo G high power ethernet converter WLI-TX-4-G54HP like new, The CD and quick setup guide and owners manual were not in the package. So I looked up info on the computer and downloaded guide, Manual and firmware needed to setup ethernet converter. however it didnt seemed to work, Technical support was very knowledgeable and put me on the right track quickly. I am truly amazed with the performance of this ethernet converter I have a Nice Denon stereo receiver that needs an ethernet connection also my blu ray player. it is truly a great device. I am very satisfied with the customer technical support. I highly recommend this ethernet bridge."
5,Wow!,"I was very weary for a ""Buffalo"" product, not having good experiance in the past. Netgear, D-Link, Belkin, and many pain killers later I was about to give up. I found this box and thought I would give it a try. About 5 minutes later my XBOX 360 and my DirecTV receiver were both online and I was in shock. Amazingly easy to configure with any wireless router - just enter your SSID and your password - and BAM! You're online. ENJOY! By this with ease - it will work and is the only solution I found that has four ethernet ports."
3,Average,"Memph Bleek album is just the same old Roc stuff. Club tracks, thug tracks, but that's all. I don't know why he say he's alright or good 'cause it's not true. He's a average rap emcee. This is rap not hip hop. If you like rap, you'll like it.Told: 3-stars."
4,Bleek!!! Da banger lp,"Due to the fact Memphis Bleek isnt Jay-Z he has received alotof unjust criticism. .... but with that aside he does have one thinggoing for him PRODUCTION. this album is packed with tigh to def beatsand bangers. songs such as ""They Will Never Play Me"" and""Hustlers"" are just plain phat. And while Memph ... in theindustry. This album is packed with hella beats to ride out to and getcrunk."
4,Bleek,"This is an allright album. When I saw it at the store I didn't know if i should buy it or not, but I did and its allright. You got to like eastside rap to buy this album."
2,blah,"Alright...Here it goes: Although the Memph Man can flow, got tight producers and he got Hova, Beans, and....Amil(i guess)on his side, it's not really worth the 10-19 dollars you'll spend by buying it. Bleek can definately flow for a rapper who has low lyrical content. For people who like RAP and don't really know Hip-Hop then you'll like this. I admit i love ""Is That You Chick"" because it was produced by the one and only Timbaland and it was Jigga's song before (""Is that You B**ch""). ""Bounce B**ch"", produced by Swizz Beatz is cool. The begginnng of ""Change Up"" when Beanie Sigs spits is tight... but..... There's really no track in this cd that you can say Bleek got lyrics"
2,yo this may be tight,"but too commercial for one, hey if that what u like, buy it, if u like hearin peeps rap about how much ice they rock and how many girls they pimp, this and cashmoney rappers is for u. but for anyone that likes the hip hop that has tru meaningful lyrics like 2pac or Nas or Bone will be disappointed. tha fact that Bleek dissed Nas rite in tha source created a conflict between ill will and roc a fella that wouldnta been there if bleek would have kept talkin about his own riches instead of bustin on Nas. oh well, cop this if u love club or commercial rap wit all beat and no lyrics."
2,memph doesn't fit well with ROC,"the understanding, the 2nd installment from roc a fella artist memphis bleek, doesn't exactly make the cut. from a beat perspective it's great, (futuristic sounding) but lyrically it is the pits. true, memphis bleek has a voice filled with energy but where's the depth? his lines sound like they could be written by a little kid. plus he bites too much. ""bout it bout it"" and ""soulja"" have been used one too many times by the no limit camp and you see the result of what's happened to them. plus it is said that jay-z writes his lyrics. frankly, i just miss the memphis bleek that spit on the hard knock life intro, ""hand it down"" THAT was a lyricist. i rate this album 2 stars because i know memph is sellin himself short and can come with it a lot better than on this attempt."
4,4.5 stars,"I was reluctant to buy this album. In the store I was looking for Lil Wayne and I couldn't find it so I copped Bleek(hesitantly) and I thought I had purchased commercialized garbage.(I was looking for Lil Wayne and I have 3 Jay-z albums, Get it? I love commercialized garbage.).I took it home and gave it a listen and I loved it. Best songs are: 2,3,5(Jay-Z is tight although he just talks),6,7(B. Sigel represented on this song),9,10,13(All of them held it down, man Twista flows fast!),and 14. # 2 was my favorite. There are no bad songs. Cop this album for real!"
3,No Diss My View,I dont see what all the hype is about I mean Memphis is OK Lyrically but his beats are garbage no disrespect but why does Jay-Z get all the hot beats and they give the others garbage I gave it 3 stars because lyrically Memph is Hot but it would be 5 stars if this was an accapella CD I mean I like the songs Mind Right and My favorite I get High but the rest accapella and I 4got is that your chick but it gets 3 stars from me.
4,"If you love Memph Man, you'll love this","Memphis Bleek returns for his sophmore album hotter than ever. This CD is what Roc-a-Fella is all about. If you are a big fan of Jigga, Memphis Bleek, Beanie Sigel, and the rest of the Roc-a-Fella family, than this CD can not be missed. Bleek is back with rhymes tighter and beats doper than his first, Coming of Age. While that was a great CD, The Understanding shows how Memphis Bleek has matured in his career, with songs that seem to have more meaning, but still holding true to the ROC ways of making money and getting those guns. If you enjoyed the first Memph CD, or even Jay-Z's Dynasty, as well as the summer single of Hey Papi, than this is what you need. And speaking of Jay-Z, if you get your jollies off of him rapping in on tracks, he's all over this one. The only downside to this cd is that it's missing DJ Clue shouting and claiming to be the one that brought us Bleek. Wait, that's a good thing. To go with today's lingo, ""this cd is off the hook, yall."""
4,All the Bleek haters need to quit it...,"I know a lot of people don't like Bleek... but this album is off the hook. EVERY single beat is off the chain, and you can see how Memph has improved lyrically since ""Coming of Age"". My favorite tracks are ""I Get High"", ""My Mind Right remix"", ""Hustlers"", ""PYT"", ""Is That Your Chick""... EVERYTHING. Not quite a 5 star album if you compare to Ready to Die, Illmatic, etc. but a very very good album. I highly recommend it."
5,Great CD,"No complaints about the actual CD. The mailer packaging should have been a little better though. The case was crushed when it arrived. Obviously, I was more interested in the music, but kind of a drag to have to find a new case."
5,The very best book by Barbara Tuchman,"Tuchman is a great historian. She has a way of explaining things that is very bright, clear and interesting. And this particular book I consider it to be her best. The 14th century is full of events, begining with the black plague that killed one third of the European population . She found a way of connecting these events through the life of one nobleman, Engerrand de Coucy."
2,Needed a Good Editor,"While the subject matter is interesting, the author buries it in unimportant details. I read a few other reviews and the terms, bore, slog and fight through are appropriate in reference to reading this tome. A good editor would have culled this book down significantly to let a great story shine."
5,this is THE introduction to the 14th century,great read; re-reading it again at the moment; enjoying all the nitty gritty details; highly recommended.
2,Overstuffed and Overwritten,"This book is a slog. Tuchman is non-selective in her use of detail and unsparing in unnecessary description. The result is that for long stretches the book has no focus or organizing principle. The style tends to upstage the content. This reader was caught in a blizzard of facts, names, and words.Worse yet, the title is misleading if it seeks to promote an analogy between the Fourteenth and Twentieth Centuries. No matter how similarly bloody the two periods, the Medieval and Modern world views and social structures are so disparate that motives for behavior cannot be compared. Behavior may be similar on the surface -- owing to the constancy of human nature -- but it is manifest according to its environment, and these manifestations differ in fundamental ways between the two eras.There are many better histories of the period written by better writers and analysts who have the ability to meld selected details into patterns."
3,"A good, but not great, book","Tuchman builds a wonderful mental picture of the 14th century, and what it must have been like to live back then. She follows the 14th century through the life of a French nobleman (but not a king). This led to a book that isn't a great story - she purposely picks someone who has some historical info, but not a king or queen whose life would be too far removed from the ""common"" life. Unfortunately, that means there isn't a lot of detail about this guy's life, and she is too much of a historian to make anything up. So the story is kind of sketchy. And (this is probably endemic in any 14th century booK) she spends a lot of time talking about relationships between royalty across Europe, which for some reason bores me silly. All that said, I have a completely different view of medieval Farnce and England than previously, and I learned a lot. A worthwhile read that sometimes bogs down."
3,Overrated,"While this book has some fascinating detail of the 14th century, I don't agree that it is the most ""readable volume on this subject."" Tuchman goes off on tangents which make the book difficult to follow and easy to put down."
2,"Fact-filled, but disorderly, uninteresting, and down right","Barbara Tuchman's attempt at this is unbelievable. Thebook is essentially a rambling of medival history whichoften refers back to a certain dynasty. It is filled withhundreds of obscure French names which have nothing to dowith anything. Tuchman jumps from one topic to another,creating a loose (even non-existant) organization whichleaves the reader lost and confused. Tuchman seems tothink that her reader already knows the information sheis trying to convey. It is almost as if Tuchman sat downat a typewriter and asked herself, ""what do I know aboutmedival European history?"" and then wrote whatever came toher mind, when ever it came to her mind. With the exceptionof the 5th chapter, which details the death and sufferingof millions during the various plagues, the novel is as dryas sand. The book's only merit is its informational value,which if the reader can follow, or for that matter evenstay awake, he may gain something from this book."
2,Totally disorganised and hard to follow.,"I was really looking forward to this book having read such good reviews, but was totally disappointed. The facts are there somewhere, but buried under so many irrelevant details, in the end I gave up on it. Which is a pity because there are not many books around in English on this era of French history. Definitely not recommended."
2,Wake me when it's over....,"I love medieval fiction, i.e. Martin's 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series and Follett's amazing The 'Pillars of the Earth' and 'World Without End'. Not Tuckman's fault that it is actually a historical narrative, but boy, is it boring! Mired in detail about French nobleman Enguerrand de Coucy it was way too dry for me. If you're a history buff, go for it. But if you're looking for entertaining reading, keep looking."
2,Uneven work,"(Hardcover book) About one sixth of the book was very interesting and informative with generalizations about the era, specifics on some battles and the plague. The rest had way too much fine detail of endless alliances, wars, marriages, etc. of no interest to a modern reader. It gave me the impression of a thesis on DeCourcy that was padded to made a book."
2,A big bore!,Although I really liked her 'March of Folly' I found this book hard to follow in that she allows too many names and places to flow together. If you read this book be ready to labor at it; it is not an easy read.
1,A history written in verisimilitude,"Once again, Barbara Tuchman has walked the thin line of factual reporting and making the facts personal to the reader. Yet, she has done so without bending the truth, but enhancing history by illustration of thoughts. Dr. Tuchman has done this by including noted paintings of the periods to explain various views of the time. She also links facts from one facet of history at the time and how it contributed to the change or stasis of the historical point. Such an approach makes history a joy to study and the dates (if you are into such numbers!) easy to remember.The 14th Century is a particular favorite! Tuchman shows the rise and fall of chivalry, feudalism, various schisms, and such a plethora of events. Though they seem unlinked, she has drawn them together under one cover. History shall never see another writer as this."
1,saving paper,"this is an excellent writer - her ""Guns of August"" was my first read. This book was printed with a verysmall font , making uncomfortable reading - I had to return it unread. Wish you could have indicated the small print."
2,Wrong Title,"You get tired of one name: de Coucy. The book should have been titled ""Enguerrand VII, Lord of Coucy."" I slogged through it. Seems he and his issue were everywhere at once, to quote an old AbFab episode: ""...beside the rich and famous, behind the rich and famous, under the rich and famous..."" When Barbara Tuchman could get off her favorite subject of his lordship, she would get back to the 14th century and was quite entertaining and informative about how you would live your life in that time. Yes, she used him as her north star to keep the book anchored, but you pretty much got tired of him halfway through the book and wished Edward had cut off his head or the Black Death had got him. Had the book been advertised as a history of the de Coucy family instead of a history of the 14th century I would have been more forgiving. She really needs to retitle this book."
5,Specific history in full flavor,"Tuchman uses her research skills to bring detail and depth to a fascinating period which has powerful echoes in the 21st century. She focuses around a single person, but recreates the times brilliantly. Useful for someone looking for WHY of things today?"
5,Distant Mirror is fascinating,"Between the plagues and constant warfare, it's amazing that anyone in Europe survived the 14th. century."
2,Not What You'd Hope For,"I have my Photoshop 5.5 and sad to say, the Help functions of the softwares proved a lot more helpful than this book. It offers very little of what a beginner needs. A step-by-step example would've been useful. Discussions of the features are too simplistic, but this couldn't even fit the mold of a for Dummies or a for Idiots book. It's neither! Not for beginners, not for intermediate-skilled users, and definitely not for experts. A lot of features on Photoshop web artists are included, but you'd wish not to find here but on a magazine. It's a total disappointment!"
1,Extemely disappointing,"As a beginning Photoshop PC user, I found this book almost completely useless.The author gives no step-by-step instructions on creating specific items. Instead, he just says, ""I opened the logo and inserted into the image (see Fig 12)"" etc, but since no CD is included, you can't follow along! Unbelieveable. The author's website does not have any downloadable examples from the book, either.The sections on the individual web masters are a waste of space. Again, no technical details or how-tos are included. Seems more of a marketing gimmick for the author's pals.In some of the screen shots, the menus don't match the layer that is supposed to be current. Very confusing.I bought this book at a remainder table for [price] and it was [price] too expensive."
3,Nice but basic,"As guitar music books go, its pretty standard fare. All the songs from the album are there in all their 'lying in the hammock drinking Coronas and playing guitar' glory, so thats good. The biggest problem I have with the book is that there is no guitar tab: only the basic melody music and the chords. If you want to fully recreate that 'Chris Isaak and the Silvertones' sound, complete with lead guitar riffs, you are on your own."
3,has a few errors,"i love chris isaak's music which is why i bought this book, but it appears to have a few errors. after his concert, i asked him where the capo is for two hearts, and apparently it's on the third fret instead of the first which is where this book claims it is. i also noticed in his baja sessions video that for pretty girls don't cry he doesn't seem to use a capo, but the book gives chords for when a capo is on the first fret. since i am learning how to play guitar, i would prefer to learn how to play these songs the way he plays them so that i can get the correct sound."
3,Unpleasantly Surprised,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 3 yr old daughter who is the ultimate girly girl, When I received them they were about the size of a half dollar each. I expected them to be a tad bit bigger! She loved the princesses on the front and was ecstatic that she now had her own perfume. Pros: Nice if your child is a Disney Princess fan, Fragrances are not too bad, and a good stocking stuffer.Cons: Too small, does not have applicator, and can easily spill if opened.Overall as long as she liked it I'm satisfied with the purchase."
2,Not that great,"The design was cute and as described; however, the girls nor I enjoyed the scents too much. It was as described but wouldn't recommend it due to the scents."
1,Empty,One of the glass was empty. Maybe the Cinderela's glass.I had to send a gift and no have time to replace.
4,workaholic cop with a romantic twist!!,"A workaholic cop, Maggie, is faced with a murder and a series of strange break-ins and robberies as the Holidays approach. She throws herself into her work in order to avoid dealing with her socialite mother, her political climbing boss and a long time ""friend"" who wants more commitment from Maggie than she thinks she is capable of. As Maggie investigates the murder she must do as she is ordered even when it complicates the investigation. As the robberies continue she sees an unusual pattern and is drawn into a world of child neglect and endangerment. She senses that her career may be making an unexpected change and tries to get some control over that situation as well.This is an interesting story of dealing with the things we can not change and directing those things that we can."
5,Excellent transaction of paperback purchase. A+++,"Excellent Seller!!! Item as described, old paperback packed VERY securely, which I always appreciate. Sent quickly. Would buy from this dealer again. A+++"
5,Everything wallet,"I have had this same wallet for 18 years, so when my wife complained my old one was showing wear, I purchased the same one.It holds many cards, it has two compartments for cash and/or receipts."
1,Expensive ordinary tasteless tea,"I just blew 12 bucks to find out that this is NOT Amaretto tea but ordinary tasteless tea. Since I had to open it to find out that it was not Amaretto tea, I can not return it. Very unhappy with the product and the whole experience. Will not be shopping with this seller again."
3,taggie ball,We got this for our 9 month old daughter because she loves the tags on everything but she hasn't seemed very interested in the tags on this ball. She carries the ball around some and rolls it occasionally.
5,Great for Tag Chewers!,I got this for a friend's child and he loves it! It saves the random tags around their house from getting destroyed too! The ball itself has soothing pastel colors and is very soft. Great for rolling or tossing.
2,Tag me disappointed,"My daughter loves balls and she loves chewing on tags. When my husband and I saw this product at a local toy store we could not wait to buy it and watch her with it. We have been waiting for her to play with it for two months. She is just not interested in it at all. We have received other taggies products (soft books and a board book) and she does not play with them either. My daughter loves to play and can spend hours knocking down block towers, chewing on books or rolling balls, but she is not impressed with taggies and neither are we. However, I took the ""toss the taggie"" ball to a group play date and some of the older toddlers seemed to enjoy it."
2,If you don't mind clogs ...,"This printer is capable of providing high quality images and color graphics. But it is a tremendous ink waster and an annoyance. I have had it for about 2 years and have given up trying to print without first cleaning the heads, even if I use it every day. Cleaning the heads requires time and ink, making this inexpensive printer much more costly than it should be.I used another Epson printer (the C60) which had the same clogging problem. I will never buy another Epson printer again, despite the print quality."
2,Downgrading Our Rating!,"Now that I've had this for almost a year, I am downgrading it from 4 stars to 2. Epson is rightly known for the quality of their inks and papers, but nozzle problems on this printer make it frustrating to use. The black ink nozzle in particular gets clogged VERY frequently, and it takes multiple passes with the cleaning utility to unclog it - a big waste of ink and time. And the printer must be unclogged nearly every time I use it to print pictures. When it works, it rivals anything you'll get from a photo lab. The problem is getting it to work."
1,"Noisy, Clogs...you get what you pay for I suppose.",I got this for printing from my Olympus 2040Z as I saw good photo reviews but after living with it I'll never buy another Epson. When all the planets alignand you use good paper you get good pics BUT...the clogging drove me crazy.*In my experience* the Epson needed to be used everyday to prevent clogs and/or lackluster colors.I have an HP 855C that was down the basement not used for over a year and it gave me great color as soon as I fired it up.For me.. it just took too much hoping and I wasted too much ink and paper. I want a printer that is reliable and the Epson just fell far short. It is now down the basement packed away.
1,Star of frustration,"I will never buy epson again. The biggest problem is the nozzles keep getting clogged, missing lines on the black print. This needs repeated head cleaning and I can promise you, your inks runs out just doing this. Surprisingly this is a universal problem. Epson was fully aware of this. THEY STILL CONTINUED TO SELL THE PRODUCT."
5,I love this printer!,"True it may be slower and somewhat noisier than other models, but the prints that come out of it are outstanding! At first it seemed like the ink went fast but it really lasts as long as any other printer I have used. One nice feature is it tells you how many prints are remaining like that last printed. Although the warning about the ink levels comes on, you do have the option to continue printing until the ink runs out and it lasts quite a few prints beyond the warning about the ink levels. The specifications were practically identical to the higher model with the exception of the sound level, speed and no roll paper. I am totally satisfied with this printer and the quality of the pictures..they couldn't be better. The prints on the heavy weight matte paper are stunning! I love the borderless prints..they rival any print lab. I would most certainly go with Epson again."
4,Not bad for the money,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the prints put out for a printer priced under $100.00. As I knew before I bought it the cartridges go through rather quickly, but then I use it only for work requiring better than average prints. If you are going to use this as a default or only printer you will need to buy extra cartridges up front. Sound level is more than expected but a good tradeoff for the good points. I was happy enough with it to buy a second one for my office as a backup for the laser unit there."
2,Uses too much ink!,"The unit worked good for a month but used up the color very fast as others have claimed. I changed the color ink ... and it was gone in two weeks even though I printed only 3 full size photos.. After 3 months, the photos being printed were much too dark plus the fact that I kept on seeing bands in the photos which meant that I had to clean the print heads often which also uses more ink. I was satisfied with the Epson 740, but I am very dissatisfied with the 780 and will buy a different color printer!"
1,This is a loud piece of junk,This printer was loud and a real disappointment!!! I purchased it to print photos and my parent's HP prints much better abd is not a photo printer!!!!! It also has difficulty with communication with the computer---Save your money
1,the world's first disposable printer,"I bought this printer around a year ago and have not been able to print one picture correctly because the nozzles are ALWAYS CLOGGED. I have yet to receive a response to my email to the Epson site for help about this problem. I guess there is no solution so they do not bother to respond. I have also gone thru LOTS of ink compared to my last printer, an hp; so much that I took it in to get it fixed because I thought there had to be something wrong because of the way it eats ink. I usually do research before making a purchase of this type but this time I was in a hurry and took the salesclerk's advice. BIG mistake. Now I will throw this printer away and purchase a different one. (I would feel to guilty even to donate it and thrust its problems on someone else.)"
2,"The Good, The Bad, The Epson Photo 780","I can say that I have had two of these printers. Not because I liked them so much, but because they can be very difficult to use. Original purchase was sent back to factory and it's replacement still has the same problems.Worse yet, Print Heads constantly get clogged up and multiple cleanings are necessary to get a descent print.Good photo output when you aren't fighting with the head cleaning feature or changing ink carts. Sorry Epson, I'm going to Hewlett Packard...."
5,Awesome,This is an awesome photo quality printer!!It is hard to tell the 'real' photo from the Epson
1,big waste of time,"I would not recommend this printer at all. The printing quality is great when it works. Guaranteed, the majority of the time something will go wrong with your print, whether it is a feeding problem, or annoying ink splotches on your printout, or faint or faded colors printed. Trust me, i've gone through several Epsons and they've all performed this way. My last Epson died after less than a year. Plus you'll spend a fortune on paper and print cartridges. Frankly, if i worked for Epson i would be ashamed of the lack of durability and the excessive maintenance required for this and their other machines."
4,A great Handbook,"The other day I came across ""Enhancing XSL"" article on MSDN written by the same author. The author did a great job. The article had good content and flow, and was easy to read. That encouraged me to buy his book.I am equally impressed with his book. It covers quite a bit of XML technology. It has good flow and is easy to read. It has plenty of examples. Thank God, it does not give any coverage to DTDs, like quite a few other XML books in the market. It is pretty much up to date with the XML specs when it comes to XPath, XSL, and Microsoft's XML Parsers. It gives good comparison of the differences in some recent versions of the MSXML. Now the reason I gave four stars is due to the lack of coverage for (a) SAX, and (b) W3C XML Schema."
2,Colors slightly different / belt straps don't fit through the holes,"The quality of the changing pad is fine, but the colors are SLIGHTLY off from the rest of the set which I didn't understand. If you are ordering this to match other items from the nursery, you'll notice that the colors look a little different eg. olive green polka dots instead of lime green, etc. I purchased another one from another vendor (since I needed a backup anyway) thinking that the colors would match, however, there was no difference. In addition, if you are looking to use it on a standard changing pad cushion, the belt straps do not easily fit through the holes so you may have to rip into the fabric a little to get it in."
5,Continuing success story,"This second volume is perhaps even better than the first. Technology has allowed the collection of more data from more recent accidents, allowing the author to truly delve into the details of the selected accidents.Some say it's like watching a train wreck, you just can't look away. I think it's more of a knowledge is power series - those who may fear flying may gain a sense of security from the detail and the true infrequency of these events - plus from the amazing detail and dedication shown in the investigation of each incident and application to the airline industry."
4,Passed the exam using this book.,"All of the reviews have some relevence. However, I passed the exam using this book and by going through the exam quesitons at the end of each chapter."
2,"Not recommanded, go for McGraw-Hill's ACRC","I agree with terry@telsafdata.co.za. I used three books too. The Sybex ACRC, McGraw-Hill's ACRC (ISBN 0-07-211910-1) is the winner, and reallly helpful. I think Todd did NOT do good job on this book! He missed points. Now I am not sure about his CIT book???"
2,Lammle missed on this one,"I used my experience, took the ICRC course, studied Chappels ICRC book and the Lammle CCNA book to pass the CCNA exam. I honestly believed the Lammle book was enought to pass the CCNA and I did pass it.I have some router experience and took the ACRC course awhile ago. I purchased the Lammle CCNP ACRC book and studied very hard and it wasn't enough to pass. He misses half the objectives on this one. Advice for people taking the CCNP Advanced router config test. Study OSPF inside and out and know your router commands with proper syntax to be able to answer the fill-in questions. Todd rushed this one out. He needs to re-evaluate and re-write this book"
3,"Has good info, failed the exam","I bought this book because of the reviews on this page. They told me this was a great book, better then Sybex, and that I would pass the exam. I think neither of those are true. I failed the exam and I had a hard time reading the book without falling a sleep. I don't believe reveiws on Amazon any more. Why doesn't Amazon fix this??? This book has some information that can be used for reference, but it won't give you everything you need for the ACRC exam."
2,This book WILL NOT prepare you for the exam,"I passed every other exam in the CCNP on the first time(CLSC, BCRAN, CIT). I took this test twice with just this book and failed. I felt totally unprepared when i saw some of the questions on the test. The test concentrates on OSPF, EIGRP. THe book does not even have a list of OSPF commands. I had to look them up on the Documentation CD. I will not buy another Lammle book. I think this is poorly written, developed and structured for the certification test."
2,Not what I expected,"This book doesn't compare to the author's CCNA book for exam preparation. Lots of lacking material, especially on the routing protocols and explanation on VLSM. I recommend using another book to fully understand topics covered for the ACRC exam."
2,Weak,"Lammle did a superb job with the CCNA study guide but this book isn't much more than an introduction to most of the topics. It does not contain information on all ACRC topics and skips over huge amounts of material with only brief comments. His writing style is fine but the content is weak. Compare this to Laura Chappels ACRC book and the difference is significant. I bought both, and I would buy this book again---only as a supplement. You aren't going to pass a tough exam like ACRC with only one book. I suggest at least two, three is even better."
1,Absolutely Not The Book To Buy To Pass The ACRC Test,"Errors in diagrams, errors in text, poorly organized, material description very weak. Test questions barely relevant to actual test. Pay the extra for the CiscoPress ACRC book and do the hands-on router work"
1,"Hard to read, doesn't cover exam objectives","Always use Cisco material to pass Cisco exams. Period. This book doesn't compliment the Cisco material at all. East Coast CCIE is a friend of the authors of this book-which is extremely obvious! I returned this book. However, it if was only $35, I might have kept it for other reference. But not at this price."
5,Great ACRC text,"I recommend this book to anyone wanting to start towards their CCNP. Use the Sybex CCNA Study Guide to get your CCNA, then use this book to get your ACRC test completed. The review questions are right on with the exam. Study hard."
3,"Book is readable, but lacking in detail on some subjects.","I bought this book in conjunction with the Cisco Press ACRC book. I have found errors in both books, but more in this book. Some of the examples and questions in the book conflict with the answers to the study questions on the CD. So I have had to reference the Cisco Press ACRC book to reconcile the difference - very time consuming and a little frustrating. I have also had to reference the Cisco Press ACRC book and Cisco CBTs to get more detailed information on EIGRP and other topics. I would buy both books and get the errata sheet for this book."
5,Fantastic!!,"I've actually read the other two ACRC books on the market (Sybex and Cisco's) and while they were good, this one was great. Easy to read, quality diagrams, and a strong self test makes this the way to go. I found it so useful, that I've also bought the Syngress CIT book."
1,Hard to read.,"I found this difficult to read and the CD did not work on my PC. That could be my PC, but it just seems like I have had a bad time with this book. I can't understand it. I wish someone would make a book that was for beginners. This book assumes you know a lot already. I have passed my CCNA but this is too hard, too fast. Mybe the next revision of this book will be written so MCSE's can understand it. Just because they are CCIE's, it seems like they don't care if they write for understanding. I think the writers and publishers want you to buy the book because they have CCIE's writing for them now. So what. I want someone to write something that is easy to understand and use. I am not asking for anybody to give me the test, just work me through the objectives in a clear, well thought out manner."
3,An OK ACRC book,"I don't agree with the comments from some other readers. This book was not as bad as they described. I used this book as the main study guide with my experience and I passed the exam. This exam is not easy at all and I won't be surprised if anyone fails for the first attempt. Basically, this book covers all the topics in the exam. However, the questions in self-tests are too easy and never match to those in the real exam."
4,Passed the test - with help,This book is well written and does cover enough(in theory) to pass the ACRC test. I also used cisco ACRC CBT's and actual experience on 3 routers to prepare. I give it 3 stars on content and 5 stars on readability (4 overall). I think this book could use a little more coverage instead of the tabular summaries it uses but is is very readable unlike some other tech study guides I have read.
4,Excellent Book...But Not All Encompassing,"This book is extremely easy to read and quite accurate. However, this book alone will not be enough to pass the ACRC exam. I read this book and also performed some of the pre-tests available on the Internet and was able to pass the exam....barely."
2,Easy to read but full of errors.,"I am half way through this book and find it an easy read. However, I lost confidence in it because of the many errors in the text, questions, and labs. I have to read this book with several other books to confirm questionable information. If you buy this book be sure to print the errata fromhttp://www.sybex.com/cgi-bin/rd_err_temp.pl?2403err.html.Of course, the errata does not cover all of the errors I have found. This book may be a good one compared to the others (in reference to other comments here at Amazon), but I find it very disappointing."
2,Misses the Mark,This book does not do a good job of covering the Cisco objectives. Anyone could have picked up the Cisco Course book and outlined the objectives. Instead the author gives you information in a random manner and goes into too much depth on topics that are not even covered on the test. The questions are to basic and take thier answers from the text in the book. They are not thought provoking. If at all possible I would suggest the Cisco Press Books.
2,The objectives are scattered and burried in the book,"I passed my other Cisco exams using Cisco materials but they changed the ACRC to 11.3 so I bought this one. Come on Lammle! Take some direction from Cisco and emphasize and organize the objectives better. The objectives are burried in this book and very difficult to piece together. Not to mention this book is extremely wordy. Man I love Cisco's ""slide"" materials so much better than this garbageRECAP: Stick with Cisco materials!!!! This book is worthless!"
3,this book is light for the exam,"I found this book light for the exam specially if you don't have experience in Cisco environment, the OSPF EIGRP part is covered very briefly which is the main focus of the exam. I used the exam notes from the same author but still does not give the details I was looking for. I passed the exam studying mainly in the official Cisco ACRC course."
4,"Great for reference, not for ACRC exam","Contents is well convered for the ACRC, but not enough detail to pass the exam. Of course, not all the practices come out at the exam. A lot of the ACRC exam rely on the Hands-on experience. This book alone will not pass the exam, unless LUCK. To pass the paper exam is still not consider a CCNP, need real world experience."
1,"ZZZZ.....oh sorry, I was still sleeping from this book...","If you are losing sleep, never fear, Syngress is here for you! This has got to be the most boring book I have ever read. It is better then their CCNA book, but then I am grading on a curve. The CCNA book they wrote is the worst book in the history of man kind! So, to say this is a better book is saying there have been worse books written since the creation. However, this won't be in the top 10 billion books written. Too much info that is not on the exam."
4,I agree this is a great ACRC text.,"This is a good ACRC exam prep. If you are taking the ACRC Cisco exam, you need this book. However, it is a little short on OSPF. I passed the exam, but barely. I recommend reading the ACRC Cisco book as well, and you'll be OK. As a matter of fact, I really think that this book works really well with the official Cisco courseware."
4,Best ACRC book on the market!,"If you want to understand ACRC, then this is the book for you. I found it easy to digest, and the examples in the book really helped me understand the hard concepts. It has a few typos and it was a little short on the OSPF section, but other then that, I really liked the book."
2,McGraw-Hill is Better,"I used three books for my ACRC exam. The Sybex ACRC, McGraw-Hill's ACRC (ISBN 0-07-211910-1) and the official Cisco courseware. The Mcgraw-Hill book was the winner."
1,Not recommended as the single source for exam preparation,"Unlike CCNA book from the same author, this book is not detailed enough to pass the ACRC test. It also has more mistakes than those mentioned in errata sheet."
4,Passed ACRC with Todd's book as the primary study guide,"I passed the ACRC exam today using Todd's book as the primary study guide. My feedback is even though this book is very good it is short on few sections like OSPF, EIGRP and CLIs. I wouldn't recommend using this book alone to pass the exam and you should get the Cisco Press book as it makes up for shortcomings in this book. Remember, this is one of the real tough exams and hence you shouldn't take chances. The good thing about this book is its simplicity in explaining the concepts. Todd's book + additional patch up material should be enough. Please note that these are my view only. Good Luck All!"
2,Not necessary,"This book has few redeeming factors and is not necessary to pass the ACRC exam. The only books really needed are the official Cisco books. The only redeeming factors in this book are the chapter exams which have some decent questions. I don't know if that alone justifies the price for the book. Given the chance again I would not purchase this book but would rather stick to the official Cisco books, of which there are two for the ACRC now."
5,"Great, well written exam book. Recommended.","IF you want to pass the ACRC exam, which is very, very hard, then buy this book along with the Cisco press ACRC Study Guide. Between the two books I passed the exam."
3,This study guide is not too bad!,I don't agree to some of the previous comments. This book is not as bad as they described. I used it as my main study guide and I passed the exam. This exam is not easy at all and I won't be surprise if one fails for the first attempt. Basically this book covers all the topics in the real examinations. I found the self-tests were too easy which never came close to the real exam.
3,Not bad for a primer,"I actually took the exam before reading the book and have to say, their EXAM WATCH sections are right on the money. The book will help you pass, if you already have a good knowledge of Cisco routers and networking. I haven't read the other books on market (Cisco's always seem like I'm reading college text books - Dry) so can't compare, but this book does point out the gotcha's of the exam (I don't know if I can disclose them). BTW, don't buy it because of CDROM, its only the questions from the end of the chapter on a CDROM)."
2,Not Detailed enough,"This book is not detailed enough to help you pass the test. I saw many questions on the test that were not even mentioned in the book. After using Lammle's CCNA guide as the only preparation for ICRC exam, I figured I'd do the same for the ACRC exam. I was sadly mistaken. You will definitely need other study sources. I'm looking into other study guides for the next exam. Lammle and Sybex were off on this one."
2,The concept is not clear,"If you want to pass the exam only(75%). this book is the appropiate one. However, If you want to acquire some clear concept, this book is useless."
3,Has 60% of what you need to pass wth test,"This book can NOT be used alone to pass the test, there is a definite lack of depth in the router protocols chapter. I think this book will get you 60% of the way to passing the test, but other sources are need to actually pass."
3,Errors make it hard to use as a primary source,"Numerous errors in the text and discrepancies between the chapter tests make the text hard to use as a primary source. There's alot of good information, but I feel the Cisco Press book is a bit better. BTW, the SYBEX website does not contain all of the errors in the book, only a few."
3,"Too Much Fluff, Not Enough Meat","I enjoy Todd's work, but this one is a little lacking. As others have notices, there's nowhere nearly enough information on OSPF, particularly multi-area. What makes this particularly frustrating is that at times there are pages of screen readout where a small portion of it would have sufficed. This is space that could have been used for more information.Overall, a good purchase. There is plenty of good material here. I would strongly recommend you purchase Cisco Press's ACRC book as well, which contains a lot of the details you'll need for testing-center and real-world success."
2,Beginner's Book,"This book is design for people who don't know Cisco material at all to get started. But simply this book along will not get you through the test. The Cisco Press's ACRC is more complicated and detail. ACRC test gets down to the detail which this book does not have. The type-in hands on aren't the hard on the test, the details are whats hard."
4,Good secondary study material,"The Lammle book goes well with the Cisco Press ACRC book (the ACRC coursebook is a little fleshier if you can borrow someone's copy). I can't say whether or not it helped me pass the test, as I am waiting to take the Foundation R/S exam instead. From all the people I talked to that have taken the Cisco course at GeoTrain and passed the ACRC exam, there is no replacement for Cisco material. My main argument for buying the book (my personal reason) is ACRC will prepare you for 80% of the test, and this book's clearer explanations will help you understand the rest.And one more thing - get some hands on experience! There is some place in your town that will let you tag along with SEs or use their lab. If you don't believe me, ASK!"
2,Buyer Beware!!!,"I used the Sybex book for the CCNA and found it to be right on. The book was essentially error free and addressed the CCNA test objectives well. Okay, the scoop on this book: After having studied this text thoroughly and failed the ACRC test two times, in no way can I recommend this text to anyone! The last time I took the test, I felt as if I answered 71 of the 72 questions as the Sybex book taught me. I expected a score in the 900's. The score I got? 560. :("
4,Classic nostaliga,"When I was a kid(stonehenge was just finished)we would spend an afternoon under the trees playing Parcheesi. I was looking for a board game to play and found this again. Had to have it. I like the look and the animals. Size is good for going on the book shelf after. On the boat, at the dock, in the tent with a lantern, even out on the patio, a good time with friends. A good choice. Why 4 stars? Education, not a heavy thing game. Durable? cardboard box and water don't mix well on the boat. Other than that, a 5 star."
2,Sad to ruin such a great game,"This game has been a part of family gatherings for 3 generations. When I was searching for my own game this year, the only option is this version with little animal figures????Whatever happened to a version that utilizes the ""seemingly simple"" design of this game? (I never had considered it a children's game during all those years of strategizing with grandpa, dad and cousins). How can Hasbro possibly call this game a ""classic"" version???I am extremely disappointed and left with no options - except to explore on EBay for a used traditional game set. Very sad to have a great game ruined by ""marketing experts"" who will relegate this game to elementary/primary schools everywhere..."
3,Plastic not as nice as the old wooden pieces......,"Having grown up on Parcheesi with the nice wooden ""pawns"", the individual dice cups, and four separate sets of dice (one for each player)... this new updated version by Milton Bradley (not the original manufacturers)is a bit disappointing. The pawns are now all shaped like animals and they're cheezy and plastic. The board is smaller, although a bit more interesting. There are no dice rolling cups anymore, which was a big attraction because each player had his/her own set of dice for rolling. The instructions are more complex and can be difficult to interpret. Not every game has to be Monopoly! Some things were better left the way they were. I'm currently bidding on the original version in great condition at eBay. They have plenty of ""classic"" editions for less than the new cheap set!"
4,Purchased Classic Parceesi Game,I purchased the Classic Parceesi game as a Christmas gift for my daughter who loves playing this particular version at her friend's house. This vendor sent the game out in a timely manner and there were no issues. I only gave this 4 stars because I am unsure why this version of the game is so much more expensive than the others as it is the same type of construction as the other versions of the game.
5,"Fun game, beautiful presentation.",I love the artwork on the board and the tiny animal pieces you play with. This is a great way to enjoy a classic game.
3,A Long Read,"This book does contain good information. However, it brings up the same points over and over within the same chapter, only slightly differently. It makes me wonder if they took a bunch of little writing blurbs and stuck similar ones together to make chapters. Repetitive as it might be, it is understandable. I just can't seem to focus when I read it."
4,Keeper,"A requirement for my teacher licensure program, this is one of the few books I'm happy to own and really want to keep; I'll refer to it often in the future! It really teaches me how to teach reading."
1,Missing Polar Pure,"Received my package and, just like the other reviewer for this product, the Polar Pure was NOT in the package!"
5,Passing the Time,"This was bought for my Daughter. It's a great item for her to pass the time. Oh, it's cable ready also."
3,Too much,"I agree that the product is good. It absorbs quickly and there is no stickiness. I've only been using Progesterone for 2 weeks now and the past few nights I've been sleeping better than I have in a long time, when this close to my period. My true rating is 3.5 stars. My complaint (and it feels like a big one to me) is that one full pump is a heaping 1/2 teaspoon (I measured it). If you ever try to rub that much lotion into your body all the once, you'll see that it's a lot, especially out of a shower on a cold morning & the cream feels cold on the skin. I did some math and figured that it has approx. 175mg of progesterone per oz. Most creams have 450mg, reason why you have to use so much. It's concetration is too low. I'm going to try Progesta-Eze (bummer that Amazon doesn't have it), but I might be back to BioEntopic."
1,stupid design,this boat has no rudder. you control with motor speed. mine lost the intire propeller shaft prop and all it just shoots out the back and is gone ! and their are no replacment parts for this chineese boat. I have seen several other owners on the internet trying to to find replacment props and propeller drive shafts none anywhere! if you have this boat make sure the universal jount attached to the prop shaft is tight every time you run it.
1,"huge 38"" yeah right......","tHE FIRST DAY MY KID USED THIS BOAT,....IT LOOOSE IT...BECAUSE EVEN THIS BOAT SAYS IS FULL REMOTE CONTROL, IT DOESN'T HAVE REVERSE, IMAGINE A HIGH SPPED BOAT WITH OUT REVERSE..."
4,A must have item for fans,"If you are a real big fan of the best horror punk band ever you must got this box. The box has the coolest design i've ever seen, and the four cds provide a wide view of Misfits music. You get all the classics, ""Last Caress"", ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Where Eagles Dare"", ""Horror Business"" and so on. The book is not that good, with few pictures, but at least, with all the lyrics of the cd's. It's an expensive item, but the Misfits fan's we'll be happy with the material."
3,not that great,all of the music on this box set comes in 2 cd cases in a cardboard cofin box. I think this is a little overkill. I would much rather have all the original cds and forget the cardboard coffin that is ackward to fit in your cd rack anyway.
2,no walk among us? forget it!,"walk among us is one of the greatest punk albums ever recorded. this box set does not have it, therefore its a waste. static age is okay, but available separately. the misfits were never the most accomplished of bands: the only distinguishing musical member was glenn danzig, who was an AMAZING vocalist until he turned into the musclebound midget unmusical hack he is now. and sadly there isnt a whole lot of their legacy (of brutality) that is essential, save walk among us. save yourself a lot of money and buy the two aformentioned on their own. i mean come on!! how many versions of ""horror business"" do you REALLY need????"
2,Just Buy Walk Among Us,"For anybody that is interested in the Misfits, the album ""Walk Among Us"" will suffice. Pretty much what you get here are versions that were too rough to release on an album. The same three power chords get kinda old after the first CD, ya' know?"
5,Awesome set,"One of the best box sets money can buy!!! Tons of awesome music, great book, cool pin and very cool casket housing."
4,Great Set,"Misfits Boxed Set...I really think the idea with the coffin is great, really puts you in the mood for this tacky B-horror punk.No matter if the Misfits were shockers or just tacky, they made some great and lasting music, that have lived on far after the band ceased to exist. This is a really enjoyable set, especialy the(incredibly badly recorded) live section is great. It is as I said badly recorded, but that somehow capture some of what the Misfits were all about. This can be recomended to all Misfits-fans. It is all highly recomendable..."
5,AWESOME,"this collection is perfect!besides it has almost all misfits songs,it comes with a fiend club button and a booklet.really nice!!!!!!!1"
4,Would be 5 if the songs from walk among us were included.,"I agree with a lot of the other reviewers that the omission of the songs from ""walk among us"" is a bad thing.(if you're a fan you have it anyway) But as a whole the set is worth buying if you want to listen to the Misfits as opposed to collecting them. Don't waste time or money buying all the individual cd's. just buy the box set and ""walk among us"" that should keep most people pretty happy. All the ""earth AD"" fans will finally get a taste of the lounge side of the Misfits with the original 7"" versions of ""cough cool"" and ""she"". Both are great! One more small gripe, ""where eagles dare"" is one of my favorites, but there are no less than 5 versions in this set, they could have used the space to include the tracks that were omitted. Besides disc #4 is only 34 minutes long, they had plenty of room to give us more!"
5,Misfits,This is an amazing collection of songs from one of the best punk bands ever. I reccomend it to Misfits fans new or old.
5,Best box set I own!,"This truley is the best box set I own. This collection has all the Misfits goodness you'll every need, and it's not just the songs, it comes with a book of the band's history, lyrics and never before seen pictures of the band. One picture even shows Glenn Danzig by Marilyn Monroe's hollywood handprints. This box set also comes with a fiend club badge. Truley an outstanding box set to own or even borrow off of somebody. I highly recomend this set to any misfits fan whether you don't have any of the songs or if you want the set just for the purpose of having it. This really is the best box set I own."
3,Not bad at all for Hip Hop Pop Star New Wave.,"FALCO made it fun to be PUNK but to see them go POP STAR was not MTV'S fault. It had alot to do with HARDCORE turning into Grunge. FALCO will always be remembered as the HIP HOP Outsiders that we like, not the concert POP ROCK STARS Conservative people want them to be."
2,I Feel So Cheated!!,"First of all, I am an extremely big Falco fan from NYC. (May his soul rest in peace)I absolutely adore ""Rock Me, Amadeus"" to this very day.I have the 33"" LP of ""Falco3"" which contains the ""Stalieri"" version of ""R.M.A"". This version was the one which ran down the historical facts of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart himself, and the ladies chorus of ""Baby,Baby do you, do you rock me"" was in my opinion, the ESSENCE, CULMINATION, & APEX OF THE ENTIRE SONG!!!. To have bought the CD & not to have heard that fabulous chorus at the end totally took the wind outta my sails. I was really upset..."
3,I lost a bet but liked the movie.,"I saw this movie because I lost a bet with my wife. We bet on who would be the first to yell at the kids an I lost, so my wife got to choose a ""chick flick"" and I was obligated to watch and actually pay attention.So, she chose this movie, and between the beautiful scenery (the castle was cool!) and the very competent acting I can say I actually enjoyed this movie. Oh yeah, and the ending was not what I expected. Not bad for a ""chick flick""."
3,Was just okay,"This movie was not the best of its genre - coming of age story. It also failed as either a good comedy or good romance film. The plot involved missed romances, but was not satisfying at the end. I think stories of A loves X, X loves Y, Y loves Z, Z does not love Y is a formula that has been used before.The most sympathetic character for me was Stephen, who was ultimately left out in the cold."
3,1930's England as You Rarely See It,"I purchased this DVD after fully enjoying reading the quirky book (written by Dodie Smith, author of 101 Dalmations) along with my book club. The characters from the book come vividly alive in the DVD and the story remains, for the most part, true to the book. Be aware there are two scenes with nudity, as Topaz, the eccentric step-mother is a 'naturalist'. The book was a bit more enjoyable, but I do have this movie in my collection and we pull it off the shelf fairly often."
2,A Disappointment,"I watched this movie twice to try to give it a fair chance, but I was just as disappointed the second time even when I was prepared for what was coming. Anyone who loved the humor, charm and well-roundedness of the novel, please don't expect to find that here. The plot has been reduced to just being about sexual tension (not love), depression and struggling against poverty. Cassandra is a shadow of her book self. She's mopey and despressed... kind of like the movie. Cassandra and her father have a reunion/fogiveness scene that is not in the book and doesn't really fit the characters, and Simon's motives for kissing Cassandra are reinterpreted, turning him into a real cad. I think the book's magic is gone. For those like me hoping for a worthy film to capture ""Capture the Castle"", we'll have to settle in for a long wait."
2,Soap City,"This is, quite simply, a soap opera--of the most egregious sort. Teen age girls might well be its principal audience. Oprah would love it.The acting, directing, and photography are first rate. It's the story that kills. There is no humor, most of the characters are nasty or mad, and there are buckets of tears. The two semi-nude scenes are simply a joke, a blatant attempt to attract an audience.The review printed on the DVD box calls the film ""Frightfully romantic and terribly funny."" Both claims are simply ridiculous. What a waste of time."
2,"Read the Book, it's SO much better !!!","I watched this movie, then read the book a year later, and had to watch the movie again to see why I hadn't cared for it. I loved the book, and as usual, when good books are made into a movie, the story suffers. I will say that having read the book, I understood the movie better. So much was in the book that the movie ignored or skimmed over, and of course there were also additions to the movie that were not accurate. Having said that, I did enjoy the movie much better the second time around. So here's my suggestion. Treat yourself to both the book and the movie. Read the book first. Enjoy the movie after."
2,Annoying faux art film,"This is a predictable period piece romance/drama - don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The breathless, repetitive and ""affected"" narration by the Cassandra character is gauranteed to annoy.On the positive side the female lead is pleasant to look at and Bill Nighy is convincing in his role as a frustrated writer and father."
2,Not moved,"I'm going to assume the book ""I Captured the Castle"" is better than the movie. The cinematography is excellent, and the acting is decent all around except for the lead character played by Romola Garai. In her most dramatic scene, a confrontation with her father, she played out her emotions in an over-slow, melodramatic manner like a bad, bad stage play. I'll give her a break because this is one of her first films, but thank goodness Bill Nighy carried the rest of the scene. The funny thing is when you listen to Romola during her interview in the special features, you think ""Why couldn't we get this part of you in the film""? She's an intelligent and witty woman, but her performance as the lead character was just underwhelming. That's a horrible shame. The lead always sets the tone for the film. This would explain why the movie seemed to drag.I found this film to be a bore despite the wonderful talent."
2,I was not Captured,"This film is a great disappointment after Shakespeare in Love . There are some intellectual ideas that stem from the movie, but they go nowhere. Central notions of what constitutes love and poverty or money and position in life are not explored. There is a fine performance by Romola Garai, but however good her performance is the script fails her."
1,Received unusable version,"I received a European version of the movie which I cannot play and I would like to be able to return it, as I did not realizethat was the version I was ordering."
3,Not up to par for Radclyffe,It disapointed me. I guess I expect more erotica from Radclyffe. This was a chamming romance and and a pleasant read and I would reccomend it as a good book to fill an afternoon. It's a sweet story and that is not a bad thing. A good bed time delight. The title fits. Innocent Hearts is a welcome treat.
3,Unsatisfying,"This collection of previously unpublished vampire stories will certainly whet one's appetite for fastasy fiction but never really delivers.Of the 16 short stories present in this collection, only five are really engaging:""Refugio"", ""Bad Company,"" ""Immunity,"" ""Sustenance,"" and ""Backlash""--and even these select few will leave the reader wishing that they were longer and contained in thier own volumes.The other stories are either run of the mill or poorly written. If you are a die-hard fan of vampiric fiction you may enjoy this anthology but lesser fans would be better off checking this one out from the library."
2,I still prefer the original,"This a remake in English of the book published in German by the same authors. This second edition has left out vital information on the earlier decors and Loetz's relationship to important firms such as Max Emmanuel of London. Bakalowitz and Lobmeyer. It is basically geared to the high end Loetz collector, since most of the vases in the book are for the most part unattainable. Thus, the book offers very little help for beginners or middle-end collectors. I have it, but find myself going back to the original 2 volume version in German. I recommend vols. 3 through 6 of the Passau Museum catalog for a much better overview of Bohemian and Czech glass."
1,Never got poster despite multiple promises,"All we got was an apology letter in the mail that they were out of the item, but would send soon. Then when we contacted them, they offered to send 2 replacement posters. They asked us to pick 2, then when we replied to their email the posters we wanted, they lost the email. A nice woman over the phone said they would mail them, but no sign of them. The original order was over a month and a half ago. They will talk nicely to you, but they won't actually do anything. Good luck!"
2,"""Absolutley Dreadful"" - Simon Cowell","This game was horrible. The MLB series just suck so amazingly its not even funny. This game was soooo stupid. The batting was horrible. It didn't have the pure swing system. The pitching was even worse, I put the cursor in one place it ends up not even close to where I put it. The fielding is unrealistic. Half the plays I didn't make in MLB '05, I could've made in MVP '04. The commentators bore the crap out of me espcially that Scully dude. If you quit a game in the middle, you can't simulate the rest of it. Barry Bonds isn't in the game. The graphics suck, as in the player faces suck. I'd say the best lookin' thing in the game is the uniforms. That's it. Overall, this game sux. I truly reccomend MVP Baseball 2004 over this."
5,no better baseball game,hitting is a little hard but the gameplay is great awesome graphics and the Pads have a great team the exact players it is great
5,Better than MVP - 989's best effort!,"Like so many of us, I have never been a fan of 989 Sports games but, after reading some pretty positive reviews of this game, I thought I would give it a try. Boy, I'm glad I did! The graphics, commentary & gameplay is so much deeper than MVP. The defense is smartly designed and the baserunning is much smoother, both in execution and in response, than the EA model. About the only part of this game that is still ""in review"" for me is the hitting. It's hard to hit, period. Scoring is at a real premium. I've found more power capability in this game than in MVP, but the basic art of making contact is more difficult in MLB 2005. If you relish a tightly-played, 2-1 game (or some score like that), than MLB is certainly for you. I've been very pleasantly surprised, and it's nice to see the improvements in their efforts. Way to go 989!!"
5,VERY GOOD,"Very solid for the price. This is the best baseball game I have ever played. And I've played two nintendo games, three playstation one games, and another playstation 2 game. I must say that this is a great game. The Franchise mode is simply amazing. You can set promotions like free program night, newspaper ads for players or your team. Talk about total control. You get to set the ticket and concession prices. My only issue with it is the fact that you cannot create a player. Nevertheless, this game is truly extraordinary. Unlike other sports games, this one is VERY realistic. The graphics are amazing and ANYTHING can happen with two outs; Just like real life games. Just get it. It's a wonderful buy.my webpage:www.geocities.com/theout_takes"
2,Just O.K.,This game is just ok. Nothing to write home to mom about. Game play itself is pretty good. But the graphics are what makes me give it two stars. But it will get me through until next week when All Star Baseball 2005 comes out.
4,Game Is Great,This game has great graphics to me the faces look very real so if you are looking for a sport game to buy you should by MLB 2005 as your next game as well as Need For Speed Underground
4,A Review,"Overall this game is an O.K. game. It's not the best. Here are some pros and cons.Pros - Graphics are very nice. Franchise and career modes are very fun. If you're like me and you don't want to play the whole season, you can just simulate it. Unlockable features can help your team very much. You can even unlock old jerseys.Cons - It is almost impossible for the computer players to make an error. There is no Create-A-Team. Some times I put some one in the bullpen for 3 innings and then when I check if they're ready they are cold.Overall this is a pretty good game."
4,Very Good Baseball Game,This game was very good because it has a lot of cool things to do. You can make up your own season and make lots of trades. There is also an option to just play an exhibition game. There are a lot of stadiums to pick from and a lot of real and fake teams to pick from.
5,"Hard to find in stores, everyone should see this story.",This was a gift requested by my friend. They were very supprised how fast the item arrived. Thank you.
1,A bad book,Bought the book and regret it. I don't want to spoilt the sale but the book is not a good book to start with Linux. The information given was too generalised (lack of coverage on how to control the system and extensive history briefing) to be informative at all. A quick look at Red Hat or Suse websites would probably be more productive for those who want to learn how to control the OS. Not recommended for purchase. I am not against the author but the book was written in a very non technical way for a computer book.
3,Satisfactory,It is not complete and I found it lacking in some areas. Could use a more effective index.
3,A compilation of How-To's with a very weak index.,"If you need a collection of How-To's and you don't want to print them off the net, this book is worth the price. Just don't plan to make it the center of your reference library. Its index is far too weak to serve that purpose."
3,Hmm...,"This book is great if you don't feel like searching through the HOW-TO's online. Although some of them are very out of date. The online HOW-TO's are really an user's best bet to getting the current information. New Linux users should not buy this book thinking that it can substitute as a general 'getting started' reference and installation manual. It does contain generic instructions on installation, X, GNOME, and KDE. I can't really say it was a waste of money, however for the absolute Linux newbie, I'd recomend using the book or docs that came with your distrobution. Most distrobutions today come with a book of some sort, if you buy the official CD set, that is. Running Linux, and Linux in a Nutshell are probably better buys, though you pay for it in price."
1,terrible book,"this book just reprints articles widely available on the internet. you'd be better off with another book, ANY other book!"
2,Why bother have a paper printed version of How-TOs ?,"I thought, what so complete about this book ? Well, it is only a paper version of ""some"" (not the complete) How-TOs......Plus, it is not the latest version of the How-Tos...."
5,Great Field Book!,Great colored photos and descriptions! More field guides should be like this one. I would highly recomend this book to anyone.
1,Too thin,It is too thin for being a bulletin board. It is difficult to mount. I finally just coughed up the money for a real board instead.
2,Thought it was self-adhesive,I got this to put on my desk at work but it required a special adhesive so didn't work. The requirement for the special adhesive should be emphasized and that it is more for craft projects than as a cork board.
2,"OK, but not thick enough","Though the item description claimed it came with mounting material, it did not. I had to purchase heavy-duty spray adhesive to put this cork up over existing chalk boards. The rolled cork went up easily enough, but cutting it to fit turned out to be terribly messy. I still have cork crumbles EVERYWHERE in my classroom. Also, the material isn't thick enough in a single layer for bulletin board use. A standard staple won't go in far enough to actually stay.I would only buy this product again if I only needed to cover a small area and had enough product to double-layer the application."
1,Would not buy again,"I bought this to put on a cabinet in order to post stuff. For this purpose this is not a good item. It is way to thin to push pins into. Also I believe there are others that have mounting tape, this one does not. It would work if it was a few layers thick but not as it is."
3,Thinner than I would have thought,"I may not have read the description closely enough, but this cork is thinner than I would like. I am using it to create a custom bulletin board, but will have to find something to back it. Since I haven't done that yet, I don't have it mounted and can't comment on how well it works."
4,Pin Map Project,"I bought this cork board for a pin map project I was working on. I had to buy two rolls as one was not thick enough. Once I had the two rolls adhered together, it was perfect."
3,Rips too easily,Nice cork roll but it rips too easily. I guess it is good if you use it very gently and take good care of it.
3,"Far, far too thin","In a way it was my own fault, but I was surprised at just how thin this stuff is. I don't know how they can claim it's good for hanging on walls when it's barely thick enough for a push pin to stick in. Not useful if you actually wish to preserve your walls."
3,Well that's disappointing...,"The description states that this product comes with mounting tape, which it does not, so now I have to make a trip to Home Depot to get some. Not too happy. Was hoping to mount this immediately but it doesn't look like it's going to happen."
1,Not for hanging on wall,"Maybe I did not read carefully but this is not a product you can hang on wall and use tacs on, it is much too thin.I went to Lowes and bought this same product for much cheaper and layered them. This works but what a hassle."
1,Rolled Cork,"I tried to flatten this with lots of books, but after several days it was still warped. A friend suggested I roll it up backward. It only created cracks in the board. I finally took the hair dryer on the hottest setting and flattened it out that way. But I then applied some Mod Podge to it and it bowed back up."
4,"convenient, well priced.","It arrived quickly, in good condition...nothing broken or damaged. I was looking to make a huge pin board with an old frame I found. I found some cork squares at the store but I would have needed 2 packages, $14 all together. With this though, I got more than enough at half the price. I even had enough left over to do some other projects if I need to. The cork itself was also easier to work with, it was softer and worked better for a pin board. Very happy with my purchase!"
4,Good For My Needs - Recommended,"This Cork Roll is good looking and worked well as a protective covering on my workbench where we keep small, delicate parts. This is fairly thin so it cuts easily with a utility knife, but it would not be good for use making a pushpin board.This works well for my needs, recommended!CFH"
2,Dull soundtrack...,"This soundtrack must be one of John Barry`s dullest ones... Overlong soundtrack with only one or two good songs in i it... Not to recommend for ANY Bond-fan! If you want to listen to something really GREAT, i would like to recommend Rykodisc`s The Living Daylights soundtrack... That`s probably Barry`s BEST soundtrack! Buy that one-instead of this dull rubbish-soundtrack..."
3,I dunno...,"Barry's music for Octopussy is not one of his best 007 scores. I mean, it's good, the action cues are fast, the love theme is lovely, but, I dunno, it just isn't interesting enough. Besides, this rerelease of the 1983 soundtrack is quite a missed chance. It's nice to have the album availabe again, but instead of feasting us with bonustracks comprising previously unreleased cues from the film, only some dialog is added to the original program. Shame."
3,"Barry's always worthwhile, but not one of his best.","I have the feeling Mr. Barry had other fish frying when he wrote this score. There's one theme with repeated strings and brass which is used over and over, making the overall listen almost as annoying as enjoyable. The main theme is largely forgettable, largely due to Rita Coolidge's vanilla voice (contrast it with Shirley Bassey in earlier films or Shirley Mason's steller effort in ""The World is Not Enough""). HUGE mistake padding the disc with Moore's wooden dialogue, which is like stretching hamburger by adding soybeans. Overall, even a lesser effort by Barry is well-worth hearing, but I place this one in the lower half of his Bond scores. His subsequent scores (""A View to a Kill"" and ""The Living Daylights"") were both much better."
3,GOOD BUT ALSO SLEEP INDUCING,"I remember when I first brought the soundtrack to Octopussy and FELL ASLEEP listening to it. There are good tracks on it, like That's My Little Octopussy, Arriving at the Island of Octopussy, Bond Lookalike, and of course, the theme song by Rita Coolidge. The music for the action seen, as heard in the Death of Vijay/Yo Yo Fight, and Palace Fight is good as background music, but on its own it is weak, when comparing to the one in A View to A Kill and the Living Daylights.The rest of the album is really undistinctive....and I have no idea why some people would dare to said this is one of Barry's best works.As for the CD release, instead of releasing new tracks, they inserted in dialogs from the movie. To me, that is just plain laziness and thoughtlessness on the part of Rykodisc.Overall, it is good, but don't expect it to knock your socks off."
4,Great soundtrack! Not so great movie.,"While Octopussy is not one of the best movies, it's one of the better soundtracks. I really enjoy the haunting melody of All Time High (the main theme) and this is a great soundtrack."
3,Barry's back-again,"1983 Barry was back with Bond, he din't to the score to For Your Eyes Only. I must begin saying that I have the original soundtrack, so i have never hurd songs nr. 3. 6. and 9., which are bonus on the CD. This soundtrack is good. Real good. When you listen to it, it reminds you about Barry's work for ""From Russia With Love"". In those two soundtracks you have many dark and mystery tunes, which work splendide. In this album you also have a very good action-theme, which you hear for the first time on Track nr. 2: ""009 gets the knife and Gobinda attacks"". The theme returns in two more songs, ""Yo-Yo fight and death of Vijay"" and ""Palace Fight"". Good soft songs are Track nr. 8. ""Bond at Monsoon Palace"" and track nr. 10 ""Bond meets Octopussy"". In Track nr. 13. works Barry very good with his action-theme together with James Bond Theme. The three best songs: Track nr. 2 ""Bond look-alike"" Track nr. 12 ""The chase bomb theme"" and Track nr. 13. ""Palace Fight"". A traditional Barry score!"
4,From an engineer/part time VHDL and C programmer,"A huge amount if info in a small package. Sure, the writing style is a little dry but there's so many interesting points it won't put you to sleep. I'm not sure ""Reference"" is a good description though; in some respects it reads more like a classroom text - exercises and all. I took one star off since finding what I need isn't always as easy as I'd like."
4,"Very good book, low print quality","Harbison & Steele is a very good, modern and complete C language reference. Quality-wise it is in the same league as Kernighan & Ritchie book.I gave it 4 (four) points instead of 5 solely because of the poor manufacturing quality of the 5-th edition print. It is printed on a low quality paper. One cannot use highlighters, for the color markings protrude onto the opposite side of the sheet. I do not expect the book to last long. The content, on the other hand, is great!"
5,Ahhh... Perfection at last....,"This is simply the best C reference in existance. Both the index and the contents are perfectly useful and expertly implemented. Whenever I'm coding this book lives on my desk. To top it all off it is printed on very high quality thin paper - it's thin size belies the tresure trove of information within. Everything you'd want to know is not only contained in its pages but most importantly can be found quickly. Concise, accurate, readable. The perfect resource."
2,Overly heady writing style,"I found VERY little useful information in this book...not because it isn't there but because the writing style is too ""out there"". I'm sorry I bought it."
1,Not Worth the Money,Get the other one by Dennis Ricthie for a C reference manual. This one is very difficult to follow.
2,Excellent Content. Horrible publishing,"I've been using the Harrison/Steele manual (4th ed.) for years. As a reference manual, it is unsurpassed. I decided to update to the 5th edition recently and all I can say is: don't. For some reason, Prentice Hall has decided to print this edition on a low-weight, cheap paper. Whereas the 4th edition had clean, crisp text on bright paper, the 5th edition's text visibly bleeds along the paper fibers. This results in a smudged, blurry look to the text and makes reading more difficult. If you don't need the material on internationalization or complex arithmetic, you should find a copy of the 4th edition. Your eyes will thank you."
3,Good reference,"This book gives a good listing of many of the functions in C. I. personally, find it difficult to follow at times most likely because of my inexperence with programming in general. As I gain more experence I expect to be able to follow the refernces better. The are listing of functions that do not exist on all systems. So it seems fairly complete. For example. I wanted to play with the sleep function and discovered that it was not currently avalible.I gave this 3 stars instead of 5 because the binding is already coming apart. I bought this book new around a year ago here on Amazon and the binding is already coming apart. NOT GOOD!"
3,Is this a copy of the ISO/ANSI draft?,"Despite the rave reviews, I found this book rather dissapointing. It reads like the ISO/ANSI official language grammer, that is, JUST THE FACTS AND IN TECHNICAL TERMS ONLY, with very few examples of how to use the language constructs. If this is your only C reference, then your in for some long hours at the computer. I would only recommend this book if you have an additional C reference manual that shows examples of how to use a construct. This book only gives you the technical definitionfor the construct i.e. parameters and return values along with unnecessary technical jargon in 90 percent of the book.It is an ok REFERENCE book if you dont have the official ISO/ANSI C grammer lying around. But look elsewhere for how to use the grammer productions effectively!"
2,Get to the point!,Some great information hidden in a bunch of rambling useless information. I wish someone would write a book that you don't have to search for the information you need. Alot of filler.
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this because everything I read was positive, but I haven't had a positive experience yet. The first printer I had printed Beautiful photo quality prints, when it printed. Unfortunately it would frequently quit mid-print and I would have to turn off the printer or it would hang for days. I went through all options with an Epson Tech.(who was very helpful), I ended up sending it back to Epson and they sent a new one. Unfortunately, I am still having the same problems and this printer doesn't give me near the quality as the first one. By now I am just frustrated and tired of wasting paper and ink! I will probably be moving away from the Epson line because of this. Highly disappointing!"
4,Great Printer if you use it carefully,"The printer produces gorgeus prints under optimum conditions. But if you use non-Epson paper, the results are terrible. If you don't load paper perfectly, the printer will bend the corners. It uses ink unbelievably fast.For every day printing, it's no better than a $200 printer.For printing photographs up to 11x14"" on Epson paper, it's spectacular. The borderless printing on 8x10"" and 11x14"" paper is very handy. It's great in combination with a 3 megapixel or greater digital camera."
4,Amazing printer,"With price that you pay, this printer is definetly worth it. However, it seems that there are different kinds of Epson Stylus Photo 1280 InkJet Printer. I have currently purchased htis printer on line but my printer doens't look identical to the image of the printer on every site. Excluding some small flaws with my printer, this printer is highly recommended for designers especially who's planning to print an excellent quality layouts."
1,A real disappointment,"I've had my printer now for 1.5 years, and have constantly battled with it. I've returned 3 and received 3 refurbished units, all with the same problems...(banding, ink randomly dropped on the photos, constant need to clean the print heads, etc.)...I thought it might be the USB connection, but saw no improvement when I switched it to the parallel port. I do think, however, that it has to do with the computer-printer interface, to have the same problem with 4 different units. I have 80-100 pages that printed so badly that I couldn't use them, which is pretty expensive given the amount of ink the printer consumes. Epson support was of very little help. I too have a friend who gets WONDERFUL prints off of her Epson 1280, but can't figure out why I don't get the same results..."
4,Wish I'd bought a cheaper model,"The printer works. It prints great pics. But, I wish I'd bought a less expensive version. We chose this one because of the wide carriage thinking we'd print out big pictures. Now, several months later, we still haven't even bought the paper to do that. We thought we might use the roll printing option, but haven't used that either."
1,Disappointed,"Influenced by glowing reviews on a digital camera site, I ordered this printer. Received it quickly, but the printer did not work - the cartridge carriers did not move into position for me to install the ink cartridges. Called Epson tech support (long-distance toll call). They had me try various things, but nothing worked. Finally the support person decided that the sensor must be broken, and told me to return it.I shipped it back and am now out $37 for S+H and insurance, plus whatever the long distance call will cost me. Overall a disappointing experience."
1,Overated Hype,"Reading your reviews and Epson's tech data leads one to believe this is the best thing since sliced bread. The only comparison I can make is that the faint horizontal lines on all of my prints remind me of sliced bread!After using all remedies offered, lines persist and the printer is a bust! Does not even compare favorably with my HP 882C DeskJet quality. This is a poor product in my book."
1,Very Disappointing,"I just bought the 1280 and I am extremly disappointed. I had a Canon i9100 for a couple of weeks, but returned it because it didn't print 11x14 borderless prints. The Epson did, so I bought it. Upon comparing the Canon i9100 to the Epson 1280, there really is no comparison. The Canon has vivid, and true color, the Epson prints couldn't come close to the Canon prints no matter what I did. The Canon is lightning fast. Even at it's highest resolution settings. The Epson is painstakingly slow at any setting other than draft mode. I was really hoping the Epson would work out for me, but no such luck. I'm returning the Epson and re-purchasing the Canon i9100. I'll just have to print out at 11x17 and trim off three inches when I need 11x14 prints. The $100 price difference for the Canon is well worth it."
2,everyone else's is better than mine...,"i am a design student and bought the 1280 because i could print 11X17's on it. i have had problems with faint horizontal lines and leaking cartridges, jammed heads just after i finished cleaning them, etc. i have a friend at school who also uses this model, and the same epson inks and epson paper as i do, and her print quality is much better than mine. the problems i've had come and go, and when i've gotten fed up, and called epson to replace it (within my warranty period) they wouldn't, saying it's the usb port that is the problem (i haven't had any other problems with the usb port on any other electronics). like i said, it usually works well, but it seems like when i need it the most, it fails for me. i wouldn't purchase it again."
3,"Excellent prints, but...","I love the high-quality output of this printer. It's now realistic to go all digital with photography given you have a good camera. Using Epson's Semi-Gloss Photo Paper will result in a print comparable to taking film in to be developed. In some cases, better. I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't for the following:It's expensive to maintain the ink. Ridiculously, it has one cartridge for all colors (except black) so if you are heavy on the yellow, you can't replace it separately, and have to buy all. And they run out fast. And... it's painfully slow. At full resolution, it seems to take 20-30 minutes to print an 8x10. (Never timed it though)"
5,The best just keeps getting better!,"This is my fifth Epson inkjet printer. They have all been rocksteady and all have delivered the best performance (image fidelity) of their successive generations,...provided they are feed appropriate coated stock. While they are competitive with other mainstream inkjets, Epsons are not at their best as plain paper printers. They really shine with premium media. This model is incredible. Stunning color gamut. Tabloid size capability. Fast and quiet. The photographic quality output is virtually indistinguishable from continuous tone without magnification."
4,Gorgeous print quality,"The print quality of the Epson Photo 1280 is gorgeous. On heavyweight matte or photoglossy paper the results are virtually indistinguishable from a print. It does consume a lot of ink, but that is to be expected. The only way to produce rich colours is by laying down enough ink to saturate the sheet which is being printed on. The only complaint I have about this printer are the ink cartridges. I would much prefer the ability to replace only the colours I've run out of as opposed to replacing the entire cartridge."
3,Wonderful Printer,"I have had my printer for only a short time, I had reviewed several brands but what really cought my eye was the fact that you aren't limited to 8.5 X 11.0 inches, I do a lot of graphic work and the photo's I print on this printer are the best I've seen anywhere, no , not even the slightest streaking, it is a wonderful printer and I highly recommend it to anyone that needs high quality photo printing.... Jim"
5,I think it's great...,"I don't want to belittle any of the other brand names that are out there, but, trust me, this particular printer, in combination with the epson 1640su photo scanner really does everything you'd want -- the options available; the results of printing whether on glossy or matte paper; whatever...everything you've probably let some professional do in the past, you can definitely do yourself -- and what could be more rewarding than doing something yourself -- go for it."
5,Kiss This,"In my oppinion, this is Jesse Johnson's best album. There are good vocals and some mean guitar on some of the tracks. Jesse Johnson usually sings about love and romance and I like hearing songs about some1 u have a total crush on. My favourite tracks include Change Ur Mind, Baby Let's Kiss, Do Urself A Favour, Addiction and Tonite. Jesse Johnson will shock u n2 another dimention with Shockadelica."
3,tolerable,"The movie begins slow and somewhat confusing. Several things are occurring for you to figure out as a viewer. Eventually things come together, Sidney Poitier enters the picture and all is forgiven."
1,"""Is this the reason Poitier took a hiatus from movies?""","This is without doubt one of the worst movies ever made! Wooden acting,poor picture quality and a soundtrack that made my teeth grate. Being a Poitier fan and language student, I got it for the foreign language subtitles. A die hard movie buff might want to see it for the early wasted performances of some fine actors,including Raul Julia as a ""Hippy"". I often disagree with the critics for lacking a sense of fun, but this turkey deserves all their venom. If you decide to see it, I suggest you use earplugs and just read the subtitles."
1,terrible movie,I agree with the only other review. I watched an hour of this and just had to shut it off. I came to Amazon the next day to see if i was wrong but I wasn't. A lousy movie.
1,DAMAGED,"PREVIOUS RENTAL TAPE....MUST HAVE SNAPPED AT SOME POINT...AND WAS NEVER CHECKED...ARRIVED UNABLE TO PLAY.....HAD TO SHIP BACK TO SELLER...RECIEVED REFUND...INCLUDING SHIPPING CHARGE....STILL I WAS SAD THAT I COULD NOT WATCH IT....HAVE READ THE BOOK...BY ""WILLIAM INGE"" TITLED ""GOOD LUCK, MISS WYCKOFF"".......BUT THE BOOK DOESNT DO THE MOVIE JUSTICE"
1,Absolutely Horrific,This is the worst piece of junk we have ever had at our house. It never flew! Not once! Nada! It was an absolute rip off! Don't buy it! Don't even chance it! It is the worst! Save your hard earned money and don't buy.
3,Not bad,"This was recommended to me by someone. I find the positions are not held long enough, and it's not as effective as taking a yoga class (no one to correct you if you are doing a position wrong). However, it has some good positions."
4,"hippy-dippy, but good","At first, I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to handle Colette, the instructor. She projects a very New Age, holistic vibe (as advertised) which was a little cheesy for my taste, but I found a lot of the poses very relaxing and restorative. I agree with another reviewer that many of the poses aren't held for long enough, but there are many good poses. It is definitely on the relaxing side, and promotes stretching and good positioning for the baby during birth, ""Whatever that means."" (she says that throughout the entire video). Lots of good breathing techniques, or reminders, rather. The whole thing is done by voiceover, even though she is in there doing the workout with her preggo students, which I found a bit odd, but I guess it was supposed to make the whole thing seem more relaxing and less distracting. By the end, I was used to her hippy dippy approach and found myself really enjoying the routine."
4,not too bad,"my only real complaint about this video is that the yoga portion is so short. i am used to doing an hours worth and 30 minutes seems unsatisfying to me. also, she does not tell you that you need wall space and they mention ""optional"" equipment, but don't tell you how to do the positions with out them.the instructor seems to know what she is talking about and there are some helpful parts concerning baby positioning and labor. i bought two different prenatal yoga videos and this one is the better of the two"
1,Don't bother,"I got this hoping for some exercises for Fibro. The Fibro info section is very disappointing because it makes it sound like Fibro isn't real. And I don't agree with the info they give. I lead a support group, and I know that Fibro is more than ""pain"". I was hoping to get some stretching exercises with this. What I got was a yoga guy and a bunch of hard to follow yoga moves. The entire thing was about ""breathing"". You need to breathe. Yes, but I wanted a gentle way to stretch my muscles! I keep geting a list of stretches to do from PT and am trying to find a video, so that I can remember what it is I'm supposed to do. This isn't it. Don't waste your money. The Living with Fibromyalgia video is MUCH better as far as info on Fibro. No exercises, though. I'll keep looking."
1,I'm shocked.,Nothing new AT ALL. What a surprise because I thought Mayo Clinic would have been so innovative. I like Comfort Zone Training Feeling Younger Workout - they REALLY makes me feel better right away. I also like the Feldenkrais water exercises DVDs too.
1,Very Disappointing.......,"This DVD was very disappointing as it summed up Fibro as ""an overactive mind and an underactive body"". The DVD expressed a very negative feeling, like Fibro isn't real. The ""overactive mind / underactive body"" really got to me......it relayed a feeling like we are a bunch of lazy slobs who have talked ourselves into believing we have this condition that really doesn't exist. Again, I was severely disappointed with this DVD.FYI.......for those of you who did not like the Yoga segment.....Sun Salutations are WONDERFUL for Fibro....there are many different ways to do them and they take just about 10 minutes. I recommend you look for a DVD which includes variations of Sun Salutations...there are many out there and you can do this at your own pace....when I am done doing it, I feel like I just did the greatest stretch routine in the world. Good Luck to you all in gaining good health, hopefully pain free."
2,Mayo Clinic Wellness Solutions for Fibromyalgia,"I was so disappointed by this video. It was very misleading. I thought it would be a nice lady doing real exercises for fibrymyalgia. However, it was Rodney Yee who did some yoga stretches and who obviously does not have fibromyalgia. I expected so much more from a Mayo Clinic DVD."
2,what a mess,"I thought this would be a lot of fun but instead it was one big mess. There was no way to pour the bubbles into the gun without over flowing. The gun made enough noise that it scarred off one dog and caused the other to be more interested in it than in the bubbles. I like to entertain and be entertained by my dogs, but this was a waste of money"
1,junk,"this doesn't even work. you are supposed to squeeze the trigger, which makes air come out, but no air comes out or if it does, it's sporadic."
4,Wonderful,"This is a really nice reference book, a great find for writers or role players. Has a lot of information about faeries."
3,It's pretty good but lacking,"This is a fairly good reference to world fairies. There are detailed descriptions of the appearance and powers of the fairies and their location. I do have a few issues with the book. I have found a few very common fey missing. Cait Sith, Cu Sith (yet in included Ce Sith and other Sith) and Ogres naming a few entries I have found missing. Also, I dislike the fact that demons and angels are mixed in there as well. The index could have been better."
3,Bad rating because of condition of book NEW from AMAZON!,"I just received this book this afternoon so I cannot comment on the content--other than to say it looks to be more for research than pretty pics. I was expecting a little more illustrations.This book was in pretty shoddy condition for being ""new"" from amazon. I have received better quality used books. The cover corner was bent and has a crease, the pages (when book is closed) are filthy and have dark marks running over them. I am very disappointed in the quality of the last few purchases from amazon..usually they are my go to for books and toys because everything ships in near perfect condition.If it wasn't such a hassle to return!"
2,"nice sound, but loud CD hiss","The system has very nice sound, but the CD makes an unusually loud hiss, which is especially evident at low volume levels. I'm debating whether to return it.The FM reception is also very poor -- it only gets a handful of stations with any clarity. My 5-year old boom box does much better."
1,Great looking but unreliable,I have had thi sunit for 3 months and have used it lightly. Now the CD player is hissing and skipping unexplainably.
5,They're Greeeat!,"I have been using these for about a month and my nails are so mucch stronger! My hair is getting there too, although I think the ends are not salvagable( I have very fine hair). At least I know what is growing in will be nice and strong. My skin has improved quite a bit. It is smoother with fewer breakous. It has actually improved my bacne more than my face. It wasn't too bad to begin with, but now my back is completely clear. I have battled with body breakouts for ~18 years, so it is nice to fianlly be rid of them."
3,style,"the style has changed somewhat since I ordered these particular scuffs. I prefer the old style, the x-large fit a little better than these, but they are still a good value."
1,dearfoam slippers,The slippers will not stay on your feet the elastic is such that it forces your feet backward and out of the slippers. I would not reccomend these slippers to anyone.
2,Didn't hold up well,I washed these once and they ripped. They didn't hold up well in the washer. I would recommend getting a different pair of slippers.
5,Slippers,These slippers were OK. I did not recieve the color I ordered but they were still comfy and warm.
2,Not what I expected,Looking for cotton absorbant slippers. These are fleace and too smallI returned the item
2,Dearfoam slippers,"For 45 years I have worn Dearfoam slippers and now they have changed them and they are not at all what they used to be. The tread on the bottom is different and they are stiff, so that as I walk, the slipper doesn't walk with me. I have 3 sisters and we all have worn these, and they, too, have found these new slippers to be way inferior to the old ones. We are sad, as we often laughed together about how we had ""happy feet"" with our comfy scuffies, the Dearfoam slippers. These new ones are demanding that we find a new brand that isn't so stiff has tread on the bottom that moves with the foot as we walk. I am very disappointed that Dearfoam would have made such a change.... and I will be looking for new slippers. I bought 2 pair and have given the spare away, as I don't even want it."
3,Not what I expected,"I read the review and bought them since I do not prefer thong slipper style either. They seem to run short and kind of narrow... For a comfy shoe they need to be a little more ""relaxed"". Not impressed."
5,Love These Slippers!,I first bought one pair to see if I liked the quality and comfort. I tried them on immediately and I loved the way they look and feel on my feet. They are very comfortable and look nice too! I liked them so much that I ordered 2 more pairs. I also recommended them to my mother and she bought a pair too - she loves them. I also washed and dried them in my washing machine and dryer and they came out beautiful - very durable. Great product!
5,Really comfy houseshoes!,"I have worn Dearfoams for years. It was a true delight to find them at Amazon.com. Combining a wonderful product with a wonderful source. They never disappoint me for comfort, long wear, and good looks. I bought three pair ... gave one pair to my daughter-in-law ... it was a gift well received!"
5,so glad they still make these!,I have been wearing these for decades and used to be able to get them in local stores. - give me so much comfort when i arrive home - i wear an 8 shoe size but have a slim foot so I need to buy the medium- it fits fine. - i own three pairs - two at home (one for my daughter if she stops by) and i keep one pair in my carryon suitcase to bring to hotels and on airplanes. i love that they can be washed in the machine. i really do not like the current trend in slippers with so much foam in the base - they are too bouncy and make me loose my balance. Wow - i sound like an old lady - but i am not - i am hip - i am a rock n roll fan and go to lots of concerts! lol
5,great slippers,"I love Dearfoams slippers, they are the only ones I buy, for me its medical reasons as I need the open toe and heesel but I would recommend these slippers to anyone who loves comfort and easy care."
4,An interesting change from the Xanth series,"...As a long-time blues aficionado and reader of Anthony's work, I have to say this is a pretty damn good novel! It puts into some wonderful words just exactly what it is about the music that just GETS some of us. No, it's not a light romp like Xanth, but neither is it dark and turgid like the Tarot books. It's a good read....that's all it is, and all it needs to be"
3,I enjoyed it.,"I have conversed with Ron on the net for some time, and I finally got around to buying and reading his book. I like Ron and wanted to give the book a 4, but I think that would more about Ron than the book. Honestly it deserves a 3, so that is what I will give it.Ron writes from experience, and IMOP the lead character is a little too much Ron. The idea is good, but the villain is cardboard (with the exception of Slim, and to an extent Progress, all of the characters are basically 2D) and most of the plot predictable (not always a bad thing).Despite what I perceive as flaws the book flowed well, and it was a quick and enjoyable read. And he included some very cool ideas that I wished he had delved more into, such as the voodoo-like religion (I don't have the book with me and I cannot remember their name), the gris-gris man and his ""unique"" zombies, and the MIB-like Vipers.All in all I feel the book was worth the money."
4,Buxton Organizer Review,I'm very happy with my Buxton Organizer. The only thing I was a little disappointed in was that the checkbook cover was not leather. It really is a very well made wallet/organizer. Not regrets buying it at all!
1,Disappointing,Wallet is cheaply made. The clasp for the coin section broke off in my purse after only three days of use. My previous Buxton wallet lasted for many years. This one is very disappointing.
2,return checkbook clutch,"The coin part of this wallet was hard to close so I will be returning it, other then that I liked it"
4,Buxton Organizer,This was my first purchase from Amazon.com. I got a product I wanted for a very reasonable price. I will use Amazon again in the future.
4,nice,"Quite good price for this wallet. It's big and has a lot of pockets you could put all your needs into it. I had thought it would have leather lining, but it's leather like (I have the black one). I bought it for my mom and she is very happy with it. Good purchase."
5,Nice Craftsmanship,"This was purchased to replace a black Buxton organizer my mother had for many, many years. It still worked fine but was getting well worn looking and she asked me to check on the internet to see if I could find the same organizer as she had bought a few others of different manufacturers from merchants around town and wasn't satisfied with any of them. I checked Amazon, found what she wanted (to my surprise)and ordered it. As always received great service from Amazon and everyone's happy."
5,Love it!,"I love that it is divided; One side for my id and most used credit cards and the other side for my other less used cards and checkbook with pen holder. The attached coin purse is great. This wallet lacks nothing I can think of. It has everything I need. It has two bill pockets; one with a zipper, so I am able to keep my money separate for spending and saving."
3,Not the Buxton I remember,"Not the same quality wallet that Buxton produced in the past. Interior of wallet and check book cover is vinyl, thin vinyl at that. The exterior is leather and is very pretty. I don't think this wallet will hold up to daily use very long. Would not order again."
3,Decent for someone familiar with win programming,Not an up-to-date book for beginning windows programming. Good for someone familiar with Visual C++ for 9X.
5,Not only for women over 40!,"This is an excellent line of products that are paraben free! I can feel this eye serum tightning the skin around my eyes, right when I put it on. If it works for women over 40, then it should work for women in their 30s too! I feel good about supporting a women owned company that uses only natural ingredients!"
5,Full of stuff,It has everything you would need to just relaxing and fishing. Lots of hooks and other trinkets. You can't beat it for the price.
3,What did you think,If you post a bad review...what the heck did you expect for ten bucks??? It is perfectly acceptable for the price. I got the fishing pole with the camera attached as a bundle with this. I don't know how long the fishing pole will last either. You get what you pay for!
2,Meh...for that price u cant expect much,"mostly crap, not much usable but hey, for my boys first time out fishing it did the job, i guess."
3,lots of cheap lures,Got this for my son to travel with. Thought there might be some good tackle but was only full of the kind of lures nobody will buy on their own
2,Cheaply made case,"I don't like giving negative reviews. However, truth be known - this is a pretty cheap item. Bought for a trip we were taking. Thought it would keep our tackle organized. The case cracked before we arrived and it continued to get worse...I would buy a proper small tackle box and fill it with the equipment you need."
5,Fish kit,"I love this product! It fit all my fishing needs,It had all the hooks I need and even sinkers too. The sinkers were just what I wanted."
5,Cover for Rotary cutter,I wanted to have a cover for my small rotary cutters because I have one for my large one that works well.
2,Is that all there is?,Don't get me wrong. I don't have a problem with Universal putting out a single disc featuring the newly colorized version (along with original black and white version) of a 1st season episode of The Munsters. This allows people who already bought the two seasons of the TV series to bypass buying the complete series set. But for crying out loud! A list price of $19.98 and a selling price of $14 for one episode in two formats? What greed! This disc should have a list of $9.98. End of story!
4,Brings back memories,The munsters was one of my favorite shows to watch every week. This brought back old memories. It was received in good condition. I never have an issue with the way my purchases arrive. The whole family would like this.
3,Y&T fans only,"Y&T has always been a great live band.However,this CD is best for die hard fans or collectors ( this particular CD is a hard find ). There are only 10 total tracks ( including reissue bonus tracks ), one of which is Summertime Girls(Studio Version) which is on Down For The Count. All in all,if you can find this disc for a price that doesn't include giving up your 1st born,the live version of Go For The Throat ( studio version was previously only available on Hear N Aid charity album--now available on the newly remastered In Rock We Trust CD), Forever & title track alone make it worthwhile."
4,most important overlooked poet of our time,the work of bernstein is moving and disturbing. his style is unlike anything I have ever read before or since. If you are looking for a book with brutal honesty and raw force this is it!
3,words from the past,"Vico wrote the original book in Latin in 1710, long before I was born. Wisdom already had tremendous problems with its reputation, and the people who responded in Italian did not understand what was meant ""for its learned author crowds speculations without number unto every page"" (p. 117). Following the conclusion in this book is a section called the Disputation with two articles in Giornale de' letterati d'Italia, which reveals who knows when a dog is up to its tricks:But then if the pimp had answeredto the first two insults, ""Excellently done,""he would have been speaking Latinjust as well. Perhaps others mightthink differently. (p. 145)Vico's responses which included, on the authority of Virgil:""Happy is he who knows the causes of everything."" (p. 163)followed by Vico's Final Statement, then an Editorial Declaration of the Giornale de' letterati d'Italia that:To this we answer nothing,out of respect for the authorand in order not to extendcontroversies ad infinitum. (p. 187)."
2,Poor reference. The low used-book price reflect its value.,"Despite the several negative reviews, I bought this book, hoping that the one five-star review might actually be right. However, after carefully reading through 6 chapters and browsing through the entire book, I had to agree with the negative reviews. There were no code examples on the website before Chapter 5 (the author claimed to have). The sample code for Chapter 9 Shell APIs - Launching Applications was a mess. It simply didn't realize most of the functions it claimed to be able to realize, and it had many errors (e.g., missing class modules). It seemed like the three examples in Chapter 9 were badly bundled together.There are a lot of unnecessary underscores (_ for continuation of code) in the code examples - seems to be an effort to make the book longer and sell for more money.In conclusion, this book is just an MSDN dump. And the used book price of around $3 to $4 accurately reflects it value."
4,Great Resource for Intermediate Programmers,This book is great for providing references inside the Windows API. I use it to get information for my programs frequently
2,OK reference,"This book is limited to basic API functions. Much of it looks like a dump of the MSDN literature, slighty edited. There is a brief discussion of general issues regarding API calls from Visual Basic."
2,Fair Resource,"Within a limited scope, this book does a decent job of covering simple API functions. A lot of it looks like a dump of the MSDN documentation, slightly cleaned up. There is some introductory discussion of general issues regarding API calling from VB."
3,pretty good,It could have had more details of what the occult is like. I would reccomend it if you are interested in the occult.
2,Serves a purpose...barely,"Like the Blues Brothers, the main purpose of UB40 is to introduce listeners to music they might not be familiar with. It is then hoped the listener will go out and find the original material, and then you would see that this is a pallid imitation. When you realize this band's best cover is a Neil Diamond tune on a CD with Bob Marley and Jimmy Cliff songs, you see how authentic UB40 really is. To their credit, just due is given to the original artists in the liner notes. If you like this CD do yourself a favor, and listen to the original recordings."
3,Labour OF Love is definetly a match for this album,"I have to say ""Red Red Wine"" is their biggest hit on this album, maybe their only. although other songs like ""Cherry Oh baby"", ""Please don't make me cry"", and ""Guilty"" are not bad. Labour of Love is a light hearted, semi-reggae style of emotion put into thier own words. Sample this before buying. I have this Cd and like it somewhat, so go with what you like:)"
4,UB lovin' this album.,"Some may be tempted to get the ""best of"" because of its length, but this first ""Labour Of Love"" is hard to beat. This disc runs a perfect 40 minutes, and every song brings good vibrations. Of course their biggest hit is on here, the cover of ""Red Red Wine"", and it is the full version with the rap. But I also love ""Cherry Oh Baby"", ""She Caught The Train"", and the excellent and moving ""Please Don't Make Me Cry"". Every other track is a pleasure as well. The other two ""Labour Of Love"" discs are good also, but this is easily the best. I'll be playin' it 'til IB70."
3,Unpretentious reggae covers.,The negative reviewers have it all wrong. This LP is simply a collection of reggae covers by a bunch of guys who love reggae. The songs are done enthusiastically and without any pretense. These songs derive from a time when reggae was dance music - before it was politicized. Enjoy it for what it is.
4,Fifty-Fifty,"Yeah, it's fifty-fifty, but the better half of the album make it worth four stars. There is some of the pop b.s. that UB40 have been criticized for, but then there are tracks like ""Keep On Moving"", ""Please Don't Make Me Cry"" and ""Sweet Sensation"", which more than make up for the annoying tracks (Guilty and Version Girl). Besides, if you are a chick then you will like ""Red Red Wine"" also! I am not however, but the album is still worth having."
1,very poor quality,"bought these mats because the ad said they had the grommet hole to stay in place. Hole non existant. flimsy rubber and thin carpeting. I went with OEM for the same price on another website, trust me save your money and go OEM or another high quality manufacter."
1,The Mystery of the Green Ray,"I started reading Kindle's free edition from Hodder & Stoughton's Second Edition, but had to quit promptly, as all of the apostrophes and quotation marks were rendered as question marks. Too annoying."
4,My son loves this!,"My son wanted to be a ninja for Halloween, but he couldn't wear the head piece for his school's party. It was nice that it was separate. My son is a little round in the midsection, so I'm glad I went for the large. The pants were pretty long, but I don't think the top would have fit if I had gotten him the medium. He's worn it twice now and it isn't even trick or treat night yet!"
3,Look for a better one.,"I got this TV as a present from my parents about a year ago. They picked one out online at Home Cheapo that was actually a good tv and pretty inexpensive, but we got the old bait and switch and I ended up with this thing. First, you will have to spend about 50 bucks to get a wall mount for it because the picture frame set-up is useless. It leans so far back that you nearly have to be over the tv to see anything. Tuner is wicked slow. It takes a good 5 seconds between channel changes. Not good if you like to flip between 2 shows at once. Picture quality is okay, but not the best I have seen. The remote is terrible and very fragile. Don't ever lose it and don't ever drop it because Sylvania is not listed in most universal remote manuals.The TV isn't so bad if you don't mind spending the 50 bucks or more on a wall mount and if you don't mind getting up to change the channels when your remote breaks."
4,Decent Extra TV,"The Sylvania has very good picture quality. The sound is okay for a small TV. The biggest drawback is the poor remote control. It's cheap, the buttons are small, and the button placement is different from most remotes."
4,"Get a free 42"" Plasma TV instead!","Why settle for less, when you can get a brand new original Panasonic or Samsung 42 inch plasma TV for Free! I got mine from this web site: awesomestufffree.com/plasma-tv"
1,Boring Book,I started reading this book because my book club selected it. I read all of Part 1 and all of Part 2 and it was so boring. The author includes so much detail that I had a hard time picking out what was important for the plot. I kept waiting for something to happen. I finally skipped to the end and I didn't feel like I missed much.
5,The Syringa Tree,"A must read. I wept, laughed and found myself in the pages of this remarkable novel."
1,I simply did not like this book.,"I realize that this book is both a best seller as well as a play. My book group selected it otherwise I would never have finished the book. Life is too short to read books that you don't like! I found everything about the book depressing and I did not care at all for the writing style. Interestingly enough, after I started it I was talking to a friend who lives out of town. Her book group chose this book and pretty much universaly disliked it. I sure wouldn't recommend this as a ""feel good book""."
2,I couldn't get through this book,Sorry but I could not get through this book. It was too political for my taste.
2,This is more like R&B/Reggae than Roots Reggae,I like Heritage and have listened to them for a few years now but this album was over produced. There is to much going on for the music to breath. The bass lines on this album do not help at all either they are way to busy. Get back to basics Heritage instead of selling out. You are to talented to not be one of Reggae's best.
2,Inconsistent and boring,"In this latest offering, Morgan Heritage reasserts their formula of ""safe"" pop-reggae designed to be commercially viable in markets outside the Caribbean.As evidenced by the R&B; tracks, the electric guitar riffs, and the appearance of Bounty Killer on the final cut, it seems as though the producers are trying hard to reach the broadest audience possible. My mistake, I thought I was listening to a reggae album.On the bright side, highlights include the catchy, uptempo ""Hail Up the Lion"" and the dancehall remix of ""U've Got Me"".For a band whose 1994 debut LP was glaringly mediocre, coming ""full circle"" is nothing to celebrate. There isn't nearly enough substance here to keep listeners interested long, even if one happens to love the album initially."
4,An excellent book on one man's rise and fall.,"Here, in this relatively obscure work, Thackeray is at his ironic and satiric best. Modern critics lightly dismiss the book as a piece of journalistic hack work, but it is much more than that. Redmond Barry, later Barry Lyndon, chronicles in a fairly sophistocated and always lighthearted manner his rise from a poor Irish country boy to the astral heights of polite English society from 1750-1820. Mr. Barry is always Machievellian in his way, and is quick and efficient with his sword. He is Odysseus, Holden Caulfield, Don Juan, and Nabokov's Humbert Humbert merged. In a word, he is very, very entertaining and very, very good. The book's only glaring flaw is it's belabored and uninspired ending. But it is much worth reading to watch Redmond Barry when young"
4,A great read for planning a smooth SMS installation,"This is a fine book for those who are in charge of deploying SMS 2. The author draws on plenty of experience to warn you of potential trouble. If you are looking for a detailed ""how to"" manual, this is not your book. If you want guidance on network and resource planning or are looking for help in how to deploy, this book is definitely worth it."
4,Cool Birmingham Toasting,"Just had to respond after reading the poor review of this alblum. I have liked UB40 for years, but this record, featuring guest rappers from England, is different and very good. For those who like English reggae and UB40 before they became acceptable for your grandmother, this is a must. It's rough around the edges, but a great party alblum."
2,It's OK,"I wanted a CD of Little Baggariddim and the person I ordered from sent me this. Well, at least I got some of the songs from LB. This is just ok - not bad, not good. If you want a CD of reggaelike grooves and rapping/toasting then this should work for ya. The best cuts are the ones from Little Baggariddim."
1,Very Disappointing,"This is not really a UB40 CD - It is UB40 giving help (and a name) to young wannabees - mainly from central England. The two tracks with Pato Banton are not too bad, but the rest are very poor. The saving grace are the 3 'real' UB40 tracks that were originally on a 12"" single that accompanied the album, these being 'Don't Break My Heart', 'Mi Spliff' and the clasic 'I Got You Babe' with Chrissie Hyndes - This one is strictly for collectors - If you want to really listen to older UB40 material I suggest CD's like 'Signing Off' and 'Present Arms' or the newer 'Promises and Lies' and 'Guns in the Ghetto'."
4,An in-depth study of a fascinating man,"Picking this book up at my parents house over Christmas for a holiday getaway proved to be quite enjoyable. Szulc parallels Polish history with the life of Pope John Paul II to give one a better feel for the roots of this twentieth century leader of multitudes. Szulc brings out the struggles and deep pains of his childhood along with his joys and friendships that would profoundly affect his views and writings later in life. Szulc takes the reader through the holocaust, his school and acting days, up to his election to the papacy and throughout up to 1994. Whether you are a fan of John Paul II or not, Catholic, Protestant or Jew, I think you will find this book an insightful look into a fascinating man. Conservative or liberal...I highly recommend this work."
4,"Well Researched, Comprehensive Biography","Tad Szulc has done his homework writing the biography. It provides an excellent insight into the zeitgeist and formative experiences that gave the world Pope John Paul II.If the book has two faults, they are:1. Lack of concerted effort to be critically objective, occasionally leans towards obsequiousness. Fortunately, it doesn't mar the content;2. Very technical writing style - exacting, but doesn't make for fluid reading. This has its benefits in terms of a very good index, bibliography and notes."
3,"good info, but big on ""cute""","This book covers a great amount of material in a an easy-to-read fashion (even when the concepts are contradictory). The problem is that every topic has to have titles and headings that are puns. The use of ""cute"" and ""clever"" are so extreme that I was unable to finsh reading. It became too much. The above average content was ruined by ameteurish titles.If you don't mind two (or more) puns per page, this book covers the topic well."
2,NOT chlorine dioxide,"After some research I think Profresh is probably a better choice. Closys uses only stabilized chlorine dioxide which is, in fact, not chlorine dioxide at all--it is buffered sodium chlorite. Buffered sodium chlorite is activated by the addition of an acid and that forms chlorine dioxide. But the problem is that this only remains stable for about 48 hours.I proved this by adding vinegar to the Closys solution and it turned a yellowish color, THAT is chlorine dioxide and that is what you get in Profresh. I don't recommend anyone do this because if you add too much acid you can cause decomposition to a hazardous gas. I just wanted to prove the point to myself.If you want to kill bacteria it is activated chlorine dioxide that you want and Profresh is probably a better choice."
5,Best ever,This is the best -- and much cheaper than retail. Most people know how to practice hygiene (despite opinion of reviewer who last posted). This product is not the strong anti-septic sweet taste and lasts all day (when you practice good oral hygiene). Plus no stains on teeth.
5,Closys Mouthwash,"Recently had an appointment with my dentist in Madison, WI (Madsen/Hirsch) and told them how reasonably priced this product was coming from you and also mentioned the free shipping -- they were on the computer bringing you up on the internet before I left their office. Hope it gave you some more sales. I love Amazon.com. Thank you for being here!"
5,5 Star Debut,"Williams was given some very strong material to work with here on her 1986 self-titled debut CD. Although dance numbers like ""Sweet Thang"", ""Don't Blow A Good Thing"" and, of course the big hit off of this CD, ""Once Bitten, Twice Shy"" are enough to get anyone up on on their feet, the ballads are where Vesta truly shines. ""You Make Me Want To Love Again"", ""It's You"", the very naughty ""Don't Let Me Down"" and ""I'm Coming Back"" find Williams in her most comfortable environment. Her voice soars on these exceptional torch songs.Exceeding all expectations, there is not a dull moment on this extraordinary debut. Unfortunately, because she did not look or sound like a Pop Princess ala Whitney Houston, A&M; did not deem her important enough to cross over to the Pop charts and this disc went out of print very quickly (2 years after it's release!) so it is very hard to find and quite expensive, but, it's worth every penny."
4,I say love.,"M combines clever pop/rock songwriting, excellent musicianship, top-notch production and a unique vocal style. Highly listenable, even if it does suffer in comparison to his astonishing debut, 'Le Baptme'."
2,"Music : yes, Voice : no","There is something interesting with the music and the beat. Unfortunately, this guy isn't a singer at all. He hardly holds the note he uses as a melody. The lyrics lack inspiration. Anyway, it can be regarded as correct pop music. It should be a gain if M collaborated with singers."
5,Please make this available on Kindle!,"It's a tragedy that these wonderful books about Laura Ingalls' mother are out of publication and very expensive to buy used because they're so rare -- I ask everyone to please click on the link above that says (Tell the Publisher! I'd like to read this book on Kindle) so that this series does not die, and stays available in an electronic version so that our children and future generations will always have access to it. The beautiful descriptions of Ma Ingalls in the ""Little House on the Prairie"" books -- the Caroline of this series -- provide some of the best examples of character, wisdom, patience, and good parenting that I've ever seen. Being able to catch some glimpse of how she was before marriage is a valuable prelude that humanizes her even further."
2,Cheap,"It's nothing but sheet metal.The front and back pieces aren't even secured in place, they slide all around.The power switch is a pain to get to.And mine just died on me yesterday afternoon for no reason.I'm thinking it's either something in the power cable or the switch that came apart.Very shoddy craftsmanship"
5,Best there is,If you've kept aquariums for a few years think how many times heaters have done in your livestock...this heater is the best there is. Bulletproof glass (keeping you and your pets alive) and solid electronics to maintain a reliable temperature. I've had virtually every other brand fail in one manner or another. Not these.
2,*Silly*,"Are we really to believe that a seasoned BIA agent and an FBI agent would actually crawl underneath a mobile with a flashlight on their bellies when they have expectations that someone with a gun may be hiding there and ""might shoot them in the face"" ? Please and the author is a law enforcement officer? What tactical procedure book did he get this scenario from? A canine unit would have been called in and a dog sent in, no matter if the canine unit was an hour away as the author indicates to cover his lame story line. Real law enforcement would have secured the site and waited for the dogs as there was no imminent threat. This is my first Mitchell and it will most likely be my last. When I read the preceding ludicrous scenario in the first quarter of the book I found it so silly I nearly threw the book aside and decided to spend my time with something better written. But I was curious just how silly this whole thing would get and my assumption that it would was proven correct."
2,Mitchell is no Tony Hillerman,"If you've read every Tony Hillerman Navajo nation mystery at least twice and hunger for more tales of the ""Big Res,"" you might try to read this book. But be warned that you'll be disappointed.Mitchell tries hard and seems to know his geography and Navajo stuff, but the story and characters seem contrived and artificial. You want his story to succeed -- but it doesn't. He just doesn't have the finesse, the inventiveness, and the story-telling ability to carry it off."
4,awesome,its a great chisel for a starter chisel its perfact for going through drywall as well when demoing or when trying to find a race way for a conduit
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this muffler on a recommendation from my exhaust shop. I put it on a 96 Jeep Cherokee with the 4.0L motor. It sounded great while it lasted, but after a couple months now the internals of the muffler are rattling like a tin can festival! Really bummed about the quality."
5,Very motivating,"I thought Tony Robbins did a great job with this 7 day course, makes great points on relationships with your significant other. Also the hour of power in the morning has helped be be full of energy throughout the day. Some stuff does get redundant at times, however, Tony's enthusiasm keeps you intrigued."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,My son received this as a gift. He flew it for less than 30 seconds before the helicopter flipped into the ground and a stabilizer broke off. He glued it and gave it another try. After a second very short flight it crashed again this time breaking off the rear rotor. The toy is useless now and he is quite disappointed by the whole thing. I guess if this product came with several replacement props and rotors it may be OK. As for the durability rating....you don't give the option for zero stars. Keep your money in your pocket people.
4,Hard to controll!,Sometimes this helecopter can be a real pain!because it is not easy to controll.It can be real fun.But it is not fun when you crash into a tree.i would recomend a large grass area to fly in.
5,Great Outdoor Fun,"You need wide open spaces, but boy can this thing fly. My husband and I and out two children 24 and 20 had a ball flying this copter. Don't use it on a windy day, however, because we lost ours that way. It wasn't that windy but the higher it went the more the wind caught it and it went so high and so far it might still be flying as I write this review."
3,Launch Pad Helicopter,"It is a really fun toy! The first time I used it, it worked very well. I recommend you getting this Helicopter!"
3,Fun in a small space,"As an Air Hog user with my children we found this to be the easiest to use and gained incredible Vertical lift. The charging system worked great and when the green light came on my little one yelled "" Let's fly"". The controller took a few minutes to learn how much pressure was needed to lift off, Hover, and land softly. That was the toughest part. We crashed about 8 times though with no damage. The kids liked it because it always had a good take off, even from their hand. and they could feel the uplift. My research showed me this was the lowest priced and best value in a helicopter in the market. Others which have more control cost over $ 200. If you want to fly in smaller areas and love Vertical lift like rockets this is the toy for you."
4,Only for calm/no wind days,My 8 year old just lost his about 2 hours ago. Even with an adult watching it was lost because it was too windy to fly it today (which I told him but he did not listen to me). This is fun but it takes practice to learn to fly it correctly and the adults will want to play with it so the kids will get frustrated! Really there is less than a 10mph wind today so it really is for super calm days. It's a lot of fun. I'm not sure what the difference is between the launch pad version and the air pump ones - except price!
5,Too much fun,"My nephews were given this toy, their father and I assembled it and helped them play all afternoon yesterday. This thing was GREAT. easy to get the hang of, the 8 year old mastered it in just one try. It went up over 100 feet easy several times and it almost always landed upright. Always with no damage. Highly recomend it."
4,broken,This toy was fun until I crashed it into a tree.you have no control over it.It landed on its tail end and snapped it off.I cant find a replacement part at all.It was 1 day of fun though.
1,No god,"The main rotor broke at the first take off. Some super glue fixed the problem for two more very low flights until the tail rotor broke. This was the end. The charger had a shortcircuit the second time we used it. It continued to work however, with the mains. If you live higher up then 3000 feet do not buy this toy. It will not take more then 1 feet of the ground."
5,This is a great toy!!!!!!!!!!,This is the best toy I've ever bought you have got to buy it right now.
3,Fun.....No control,"This is great except for some flaws. There is no control, you just pull the trigger and let it wonder. The heli does fly very high though. Mine works perfectly after having it crash into trees and fal from about 50-60feet high! If you just want some fun and aren't raelly observing it and looking for the best thing its great. Otherwise I reccomend something different."
5,My 7-year-old was thrilled!,"Only downside to this was they would not ship to an APO. I am deployed and bought it for my son's birthday. He loved it. My 11 year old said he played with it all day and crashed it several times. What this does not say is that it is made from styrofoam, but it survived some hard days at play very well already. Durability is great. Difficult to handle, but 7 year old was able to learn and do it on his own. Highly recommend."
4,"Good product, Good Service","I wrote to them on some issues, they took awhile to reply but when they did, I was surprised by the professionalism they showed in handling complaints. Starters, they explained carefully the problems and they even gave me a plane ""for all my troubles"" which company would do that unless they care for the customers feeling? Mind you, I am residing in Singapore, they extended their professionalism all the way across the oceans! Well done Spin Master!"
1,Not Radio COntrol!!!!!!!!!,It should just say it is a wind up toy because all it does it go up by itself and that's it. You can watch it go up but can not control it. Then you just have to wait fo rit to come down and crash. So boring.
1,What a piece of JUNK,"Uses too many batteries too fast. Can't control it. Flies only 2 or 3 minutes. Broke the main blade, called Spin Master and 2 hours on hold to get a mean person tell me it was my problem.BAD"
1,Worst gift of this year,I bought this for my son for Christmas. Very disappointed with it and never got it to fly at all. All directions followed to a T. Uses way too many batteries and flying time is limited if we were to get it off the ground. After spending several hours trying to get it airborne we just gave up and considered it wasted money. There are too many other good products out there to waste time and money on this.
1,please DONT buy this TRUST ME I HAVE FLOWN IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"please DONT buy this!!!!!! it is very hard to control,plus it probably will fly away from you!!ALSO u cant turn it easily because it DOESNT have a turning knob you have to use the throttle to turn it, this is harder than u think!!!! SO PLEASE DONT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!! by the way this is NOT a beginner level flying helicopter!!!P.S. INSTEAD OF THIS, THINK ABOUT BUYING A HELICHOPPER created by megatech..."
3,pretty good helicopter,"This was my first ever rc helicopter. The first few flights with it were awesome. It only takes 3 minutes for it to charge. But after the first flights something wrong happened. The night I got it, for my birthday, I got about 2 good flights in before it got to dark. The next day I am at school and waiting all day to get home and fly my new helicopter. Finally when I get home I charge it up and am ready for take off, but the rotors get to full speed but then it just starts to lift up and always falls over to the left. You can probably imagine how dissapointing this was for me! My dad and mom and grandpa all tried to fix it ,but we can't figure out the problem with it. The helicopter comes with an instructional video so I am going to watch that, although I can't imagine it will help any. If anyone else owns this product and is having the same problem, or knows how to solve this problem, please write a review to help answer my questions!"
1,Waste of Money!,I begged for this heli for so long. It looks so cool in the box but you can't control it at all. It just launched up in the air. I couldn't get it down. It cam down by itself later and just crashed so far away it took me a hlaf hour to find it!
4,Buy this helicopter,"I bought the Black Resistor airplane from Air Hogs. The only bad thing is it flies for about 30 seconds and it crashes, with not that much height at all. Then I bought the Air Hogs Helicopter with hesitation. I didn't know if it would only fly for a second or so. But that wasn't the case. Make sure to charge it twice before you start flying your first flight for the day and you will have a blast. Controlling it can be a bit tricky but overall this toy is sooo much fun. I crashed into trees and a fence and it still flies. Don't buy the airplane but buy this helicopter. Make sure there is no wind or the whole time it will fly in that direction no matter which way you turn it."
3,Pretty good,"This is DVD is good, and accurate, but not great. Not quite worth the price in my opinion, though still it is informative as well as being mildly entertaining. Not one of the better Samurai documentaries that I have seen, and I have seen a good number of them. Though I must stress that it is still good in it's own right."
4,Enjoyable & informative,"I found this book not only very informative & funny. The only reason I didn't give the 5th star is that it was written before the exam was released & the practice questions, while helpful to reinforce fundamentals, did not match what the exam authors came up with. In the real world, I'd trust Gary & Bob far more than the exam authors with security of a network. For sitting in a little room facing tough questions, add a good practice exam to run the score up. This book helped me pass on the first try."
1,Slim to none and slim left town,"I picked up this book to see if Sybex had a different angle on test 220. Due to it being different than all other tests with ""choose, move and link "" items in the test. By page 12 in the text they use the phase ""slim to none, and slim left town"" describing your chances of being called infront of shareholders. PLEASE! In addition still in the first section they begin stabs at Bill Gates ""(isn't that right Mr. Gates?)""The authors have a very poor choice of wording throughout the entire book and side jokes that are dumb and inappropriate. I rate this as the worst ""tech"" book I have ever read.The last criticism is lack of spell check before going to press. Page 11 begins the errors with the following phrase ""This stuff is more of the ""for your information"" ILK"". From this point on either grammer or mispelled words riddle the text.Save the money and time."
5,"bloated yes, but telecaster bliss, as well","7 discs crammed with tail end prime era Buck. A good amount of the material 40%, or so, is instrumental another 10% is alternate takes and sessions and 10% is Christmas themed. That gives the set a bloated feel, but they have interspersed the differing themes which helps plowing these fields. They have also left in some studio chatter throughout the set giving it a real archival feel. If you appreciate fine telecaster playing along with hot fiddle and steel parts, this is a galaxy of stars. For all others, probably a four. Harvest is in, take up the yoke."
4,Protestant Biblical Interpretation by Bernard Ramm,"Ramm's book is a foundational textbook for anyone who wants to begin a study of hermeneutics. Unlike many of the newer books, this one does not have a particular slant other than the basic approach of grammatico-historical protestant interpretation. For those desiring to read Moises Silva and Walter C. Kaiser, Jr.'s book or Kevin J. Vanhoozer, Ramm must be read first. Remember Vince Lombardi's instructions: ""gentlemen, this is a football."" This is what Ramm does: ""Gentlemen, this is hermeneutics."""
2,Hard Reading,"If you are going to read this book, you better have alot of time to look up the meaning of words and a solid understanding of hermaneutics. This is not a book for beginners. The author is very wordy and scholarly in his approach. I see the value of looking at mistakes of interpretation down through the years. However, I just had to wade through alot that I didn't really understand to get that."
1,Narcissistic whining from aging boomers.,"It's bad enough that Martha Stewart has fetishized housework. Now we get to listen to the smug, precious, navel-gazing ""poems"" about the life-affirming drudgery that is cooking and cleaning. I find it suspicious that there are no poems from men in this collection. I suppose that is because male poets neither cook nor clean? Or is it that they just can't appreciate the struggle and inner turmoil they face every time they need to choose between Mr. Clean and Mop-n-Glow? And all they care about is steaks anyway. If people choose to read their hospital charts and call it ""poetry"" that is their right. However, it's no reason to spend money on such narcissistic nonsense. You're better off watching the Lifetime Channel's Afterschool Special ""Mommy, Why Are You Crying in Your Latte?"""
4,quite interesting,I found this dictionary a good complement to the Icelandic to english dictionary/thesaurus that I also had bought. Between the two I was able to find most words that I was looking for and good meanings to understand the differences or the different ways that a word is produced in the Ilandic language. Even though I'm not the best at english spelling with every word I look up in this Dictionary I find the I increase my correct spelling in english.
2,It Lights,"I have to agree with the other reviewer, it's not worth the extra money. (Eight bucks plus four for same day shipping. All for just a single light bulb.).I bought this for the fridge and compared to the last bulb in there, which came with the fridge and lasted 6 years, it's kind of dull. Not especially bright not even on the top shelf directly below the bulb. So far I don't see why it costs so much.Maybe longevity? Time will tell."
2,Psychology 10th Edition,"The book gives a college introduction to psychology. It is sophisticated but, drags along at times before getting to a point. The chapter placements are not very continuous and topics can better arranged. The examples used to explain concepts are sometimes long and unneeded. So explanations of topics are also unclear such as the ""garden path effect"" and can confound readers at times."
4,Good Buy,"The book is in perfect condition, with all pages intact. Good read for beginning psychologists."
3,Too Basic,"Factually, this book gives a solid introduction to Psychology. As a textbook, however, there is considerable room for improvement. The chapter summaries at the end of the chapter are basic and short-- it provides a quick summary, but no review questions, practice quizzes, or suggestions for further explanation in different areas of Psychology. Compared to other textbooks I have used that are very similar to this one, this was by far the worst. The companion workbook that goes along with this book is also unimpressive when compared to workbooks for similar textbooks."
4,Going out with a bang.,"Incorporating elements of metal and thrash in substitution for their usual nostalgic melodies and infectious hooks, Earth A.D. is The Misfits' most aggressive, hardcore release. Danzig shouts and growls more than he croons. It is undoubtedly a change of pace from their other releases, but this does not mean it is not worth the listen. While I would not really recommend this album to new fans or skeptics of the punk genre, for fans of metal and hardcore, completists, and true fiends, Earth A.D. is a highlight of their record collections. In the scope of hardcore punk, this album is one of the toughest and most timeless. For myself and many others, ""Die, Die My Darling"" is the climax of the album, but every track is a dark, fast, cutthroat, and fun all at once. They are bursts of hell-raising energy; they explode like atomic bombs. Though the Misfits' sound may have gone through a transformation for this final masterpiece, their spirit was steadfast."
4,Good album but not the best for the misfits.,"First of all I have to say I haven't listened to the CD. I used to own the two original records that this CD is comprised of (Earth AD/Die,Die My darling 10""). Death comes ripping is one of the better songs on this CD only topped by die die.. and green hell. I was never a big fan of Mommy... or Demonomania. The songs are a bit faster than other earlier Misfits releases. I wouldn't reccomend this as your first Misfits CD but it is worth owning."
3,dr. chud says buy this alblum or else,"dirty studio production, and danzig hitting puberty make for a different type of alblum. doesn't matter though cuz no matter how you stack theese boys are @!#$ bad. the song green hell shows just why they have so much influence over early 80's hard core. die die my darling is the inspiration for the best skateboard graphic of all time, of course there is mommy can i go out and kill tonight? that is just insane theese guys make white zombie look like wusses. so join the dominion and be the first on your block to say MOMMY I'M A MISFIT"
1,not quite like their other albums,"if you read any of my other reviews you will hear my go on and on about the misfits and what an influence they had/have on me. so why only the one star? because if youll notice the track list, it is simply the last 7 songs on the collection 1 album and the last 5 on the collection 2...so you may already own this and not even know it. just buy collection 1 and 2 and you WILL then have this album too!"
2,What...oh...huh?,"The Misfits rock. Their my favorite punk band...but this album....is just not them. Danzig is just screaming non-sense into a microphone. Non of the songs are worth listening to, there are probably 2 songs that danzig took time in making. Die Die my darling is great, and Mommy can I kill tonight is okay...but the rest sucks. I hate this"
1,This CD stinks.,"Earth A.D. is not worth the plastic that it is printed on. Save your money, and like go buy anything by Philip Glass. He ROCKS! Also, Amazon.com has lots of his stuff. Judy"
4,Demonomania.,"This album is fast hard core punk with catchy melodies. Different line-up from Walk Among Us. Of course Glenn is singin', Jerry Only is on bass, Doyle on guitar and Robo (from Black Flag) on drums.Highlight of the album is Die Die My Darling (another song that was covered by Metallica)."
3,Mediocre Misfits,"First I'll say that I love this band. Walk Among Us is one of my all time favorite albums. I think the strategy of combining doo-wop with hard rock simply genius. Add to it schlocky horror movie titles to the songs as well as a deranged but subtle sense of humor and its pop music heaven. So I have to say that this bandwagon-jumping hardcore album is a bit dissapointing. First the lyrics aren't very good. What happened? Did Glenn simply forget how to write. Is this the same guy who wrote songs like ""Bullet"" and ""She""? Also there's not much melody to the songs, it's all gutteral yells. I think by trying to sound bestial or scary the singer borders on self-parody. The saving grace is the guitars, which actually do sound ominous (feedback and down-tuning)and, well not scary, but effective. The sound on this album might be suitable for bands like Black Flag but The Misfits had an altogether different approach which unfortunately they compromised to appease the then current trends."
2,Two reasons not to buy this!,"First off, even if you do think these are good Misfits songs, you are better off investing in both the Misfits 'Collection' CDs. Buy those 2 CDs and you will have all of the 'Earth AD' EP (and a WHOLE lot more).Secondly, IMHO, this is the worst of the Danzig-era Misfits. Sure, the songs are fast and furious, but it's pretty much just straight forward hardcore. On this release, the band chose speed over substance. Gone are the memorable lyrics and catchy melodies; Danzig opts to unintelligibly scream rather than sing on this release. In many ways it just doesn't feel like the Misfits to me; what I love most about them seems absent here. With the exception of 'Green Hell', 'Die, Die My Darling' and 'Mommy, Can I Go Out and Kill Tonight', I find myself quite bored listening to this.In any event, this CD should be for 'completeists' only."
2,YECCHHH!,This Misfits album is a far cry from the excellence of Walk Among Us and Static Age. It finds the group struggling to conform to hardcore with pretty stiff and tuneless results. Avoid and buy earlier stuff or Misfits Collection which has the best songs from this LP on it.
1,not my favorite,"Last of the Misfits albumn with Danzig. Pretty much a total 180 for the band at that point. Not the 50's pop/punk but more like trash/speed metal/ punk. If your into thrash/metal you'll probably like this record but if you like LEGACY OF BRUTALITY and WALK AMONG US you'll probably be turned off. Die Die My Darling, one of there best tracks, is on the albumn."
4,Good resource for beginning to intermediate web development,"I'd recommend this book: The author clearly explained the topics and provided many examples of the work. I also liked this book for its focus on cross-platform / web browser compatibility. There were some basic typos that should have been easily caught though... Overall, this was a good resource to help with my beginning web development projects."
4,"Solid, usable content.","An ambitious work. The authors succeed in an all-encompassing presentation, suited for the neophyte and the veteran. I did find a lack of proofreading: inaccurate references to the books' resources, missing words.On balance, though, the book is a wholesome work: A well-defined perspective of all the ""essential"" skills (all those plates us designers keep spinning simultaneously) one need master to publish for the Internet."
4,a stone for danny fisher,it was a quick read. enjoyed the storie line. a little predictable. maybe to much $ for this book.
3,A Sad Story that Didn't Have To Happen That Way!,"In the story, 11-year-old Danny Fisher's family falls on hard times and has to move from a pleasant part of Brooklyn to a slum apartment in Manhattan's wretched and squalid slum, the Lower East Side. As author Robbins should have known, there was no shortage of low-rent districts in Brooklyn and the Fishers didn't HAVE to move so far away from their old home neighborhood and much of the tragedy of the story could have been averted and avoided!"
5,stone for danny fisher is great,"I remember reading this book when I was under the age of 14 years old. I had no idea what to expect when I read this book way back then. But I loved it. Harold Robbins is the man who created sex in his books and was the main reason that people bought them, even if they were hotter than a red-hot poker! This book was made into a movie starring Elvis Presley and Walter Matthau. The movie was good but the book is even better. Because of his popularity, all of his are being re-published and on sale on the market. being that it was so long ago that I read this book, I cannot give you a great review, but I do remember that it was worth purchasing and reading. If you like great plots, sex and violence, you should check out any book by Harold Robbins."
3,Pointless,"I can't see why people gat so worked up about Jess Franco...this shallow remake of ""les yeaux sans visage"" is chock full of 80's grue and sharp suits with padded shoulders. It drags in lots of places, and poor old Telly obviously fimed his bits in a day somewhere else. Having said that Chris Mitchum is great, astonishingly like his father but with a career running at only 5% that of Dad, he is likeable, full of charm and holds this together.Brigitte (phwoar!!)Lahaie is up to her usual standard and at least she keeps her clothes on in this one!.Great viewing with a meat feast pizza."
5,Great job!,"Excellent, polite customer service and very speedy processing. This product received is exactly as pictured. I am pleased. Will order again from these nice people."
4,GREAT FOR THE PRICE,"A GOOD DEAL, I WOULD BUY THEM AGAIN MAYBE IN DIFFERENT COLORS. THEY ARE GREAT FOR THE PRICE. THEY FIT NICELY"
1,review on Dad YOU and Me,It was too small to enter much information into andnot nearly big enough to write stories about thingsthat they might want to be interested in
3,This book keeps you reading!,This book is pretty good. It is exciting and never boring. There are lots of games in this book. Read it!
5,Fantastic!,"Stunning! Sound is unreal for such a small system! Not only that, but it is definitly a stylish addition to a dorm or bachelor pad! Change the LCD color at your convenience. A must own. Only thing I am sorry about is the fact I didn't wait for the MP3 CD player version of this system coming out in Late Aug."
4,"""Bang for the buck""","The XS-G3 is definately the best system in its price range. I've listened to others, and they just don't compare in sound quality. For you audiophiles, this thing has very low THD, only .08%. Others in this price range are mostly around 10%. In other words, your getting hi-fi sound at an incredible price. One great feature it has is auto shut off. The only thing that is annoying is the remote control. It takes time getting familiar with it's functions. The speakers sound great, but are a bit bulky compared to the main unit. Overall, it looks cool and sounds great! I'd recommend it to anyone."
3,"nice stereo, much bigger in size than expected","I thought this was supposed to be a compact stereo, but its actually pretty large. The speakers are easily 14 inches high and ten inches deep. The remote control isn't very well laid out. Other than that it sounds pretty good."
2,not for all kind of music,it is good for pop jazz and cllasic music but if i tryit with rock it suonds so bed . i like 70s progresive rockand hard rock and i can not hear it well and it suonds so bed.i am very disapointed of buying the aiwa xs-g3
4,Good reference book for anyone in clinical practice,"This is a good materia medica to have if you are in clinical practice and even if you are just learning about remedies.Ms Tyler gives some good references to obscure little symptoms that are often overlooked or confuddled in other materia medicas. She often provides original poisoning information, too. Her work, for the most part, is well referenced.One to keep and use!"
5,Hoeopathic Drugs,A rewarding read that allows memorization of the drug at all levels. Excellent and timeless book. A book to be always at your side.
4,A forgotten pearl,"Lots of people talk about this record. I know I bought it for the track ""Wonderful Life"" but as usual it was some others mainly ""Finder"" and ""Everything's bringing up roses"" which got me hooked.Those three alone make it worth buying the CD.Black has got a nice voice, somewhat alike to Seal (another of those forgotten 80s - 90s artists that are worth a listen).But it is a strong CD throughout. I bought the LP in the 80's and am rescueing the thoroughly played record to CD on my computer at the moment."
3,A little bit of the melancholy of Scott Walker,"Though certainly not as quirky as Scott Walker, the artist known as Black does possess a similarly melancholic approach to the art of song. While this CD does have its share of lovely tracks, it must be noted the his penultimate release, ARE WE HAVING FUN YET is far superior in terms of both consistently marvelous songwriting and Mike Hedges' evocative production. With any luck, Colin Vearncombe's latest release (I don't know its title) will find a stateside release or be imported by Amazon."
1,Things I'd Like to Tell Them,"This book may be funny (it's not to me, but some seem to enjoy the meanness, mockery, and pretension that make up this book's humor), but it's not a guide to proper etiquette, and I wish it hadn't been marketed as one. The grrls are the type of people who give etiquette a bad name. An etiquette expert should be someone you'd be delighted to have at your next party, not someone so vicious that you wouldn't want even to speak to her. The grrls focus on style and personal opinions and manage to break some very fundamental etiquette rules. Don't buy this book. Everything you *really* need to be told by an etiquette expert can be read in a book by a worthier author (hello, Judith Martin)."
1,Things one can Easily Live Without,"Someone should have edited this book before publishing it, because a little twee writing goes a long way. The random capitalization is distracting and gets old fast, and the book, while funny, lacked the essential concern for others' feelings that etiquette is all about.The authors come off as snobby and superficial, people I would avoid in a bar, even if they came slumming to my local hangout. They make much of the fact that they come from moneyed New England families and make the mistake of assuming that all their readers aspire to same.In short, I can't believe I spent money on this book. Reading it was a complete waste of my time."
2,Too ambitious for what it *really* is,"Sassy, yes. Funny, perhaps. Legit, nope.This you need to be told: their advice is not going to work in most parts of the US. If you're not running around with the Ivy League crowd and don't need advice on being a Cool Drunk, save your money."
1,Pathos of Pretention,"Were I an East coast boarding school graduate and self-congratulatory snob, I might find this book amusing. The ""grrls"" meager attempt at etiquette mixed with humour falls flat in all but the tiniest of social circles. Reiterating the comments of others, true etiquette and grace puts others at ease and makes society run smoothly. The EGs have done nothing of the sort. I fear a world that thrives on the elitist, pretentious, mockery of those deemed ""unworthy"" that the EGs dish out. Paying attention to their sniping is truly a pathetic waste of time."
3,"Funny, Helpful, but Limited","I have been a fan of the Etiquette Grrls website for some time now, and felt compelled to buy their book. They provide a plethora of great tips on their site. This book is clearly written tongue-in-cheek, but at times the gals come across as pretentious and snobby. Definitely, they provide a significant amount of etiquette tips that are helpful to those of us ignorant beasties who want to be polite and thoughtful, but were raised in or around a pack of wolves. But their East Coast self-love and tradition will be less than entertaining and slightly snotty and inapplicable to many West Coasters. Also, this book is not for people under 18 due to the grrls rapture over the alcoholic drink. (Stumbling home drunk, by the way, is always boorish.) I would recommend the grrls write a book for younger folks as preventative medicine is the best medicine. This book is lightly entertaining and a very, very quick read."
1,Tres Boring And A Difficult Read,"If you want to read a condescending work, then this is the book for you. Their ""attitude"" in this book goes against everything that etiquette is intended to be...a life-choice where a person feels comfortable in any social situation. Their take on smokers and how they usually are the wittiest of the party obviously means that these young women are smokers too.This book is full of generalizations making their opinions seem ridiculous. Although they state the proper place-setting and the appropriate dress, a person can get those lessons without the pretentiousness and discourteous behavior. I just find it interesting that the inappropriate behavior admonished by these young women is oozed out of almost every paragraph in this book.Don't waste your time or your money buying this book. It is definitely not worth it. I had to force myself with sheer will to finish this book."
1,unpleasant,"What I don't understand is how any individual (or in this case, individuals) can turn her nose up at seemingly every facet of American society to which they are unfamiliar with, and then attempt to pass themselves off as having any proper ettiquette whatsoever. aren't proper manners a means to set others at ease, rather than a means to place oneself above anyone who might, on a very hot day, condescend to wear shorts?I find this book (and its authors) to be childish and ridiculous."
2,disappointing,This is less of a handbook or a reference guide on etiquette and more of a humorous editorial on how the grrls wish life would be. Good for a couple of chuckles but very few good etiquette tips. The book is much more snobbish and not nearly as charming as the grrls website. I read the book straight through and found that a little Random Capitalization goes a long way. All of the 'Dear Reader!' interjections are tiresome - and are they kidding about pairing a cashmere twinset with Doc Martens?! Yuck. Must be an East Coast thing! The Etiquette grrls are from New England after all.
1,Where have all the real WASPs gone?,"This literature (I use the term loosely) simply is ""In Style"" parading as ""Town and Country""."
1,I'm glad I got this for 1 cent.,"It was horrible. Honestly. I really really tried to read it, I have a serious problem with a lot of what I read. Mostly because it was very pretentious and snooty. The capitalization thing made me batty. I'm sorry...this book is not worth your time."
1,extremely disappointing and pretentious,"Was looking for a modern etiquette guide and stumbled across this book - although intended to be fresh and youthful; it is snide, presumptuous and in many case simply wrong. Comes from the very narrow perspective that you can be appropriate and civil only if you wear Lilly Pulitzer, drink a lot and speak in broken French (avec?).Reeked of a prep school sorority pet project.A waste of money and time."
1,Possibly the worst book I've ever encountered,"This was a monthly 'pick' by my bookclub so I was obliged to read it. That doesn't mean I got past chapter 1. Anyone with common sense and a kind spirit certainly doesn't need the ridiculous 'etiquette' in this book. PLEASE don't waste your money - the idea of these authors receiving any more profit from book sales is sickening - I can see them now shopping at bergdorfs, sipping G&Ts and laughing all the way to the bank. Luckily I purchased my copy used so they didn't see a penny of my money."
1,"This book is not only insulting, it's terribly boring","I picked up this abomination hoping to find a tongue-in-cheek etiquette book to make me smile as well as think about everyday tacky behavior. This book did neither.Not only is this one of the most poorly-written books I've ever seen, it's also incredibly dull. Everything refers back to the authors' so-called upper class upbringing. News flash: if you truly have class, you don't have to tell people about it.The entire book revolved around the hopelessly unstylish authors' unreasonable pet peeves. These girls wouldn't know manners or style if it bit them in the pasty buttocks."
4,Entertaining,"I found this book very entertaining and full of applicable etiquette tips. You will find tips on how to properly wear your hair, makeup, and clothes. Along with tips on how to conduct yourself in public, at work, and at school. The writers are witty, sophisticated, and respect the need for a good stiff drink. Oh, and there is a smashing recipe for artichoke dip as well!!"
5,Lighten up!....and read this book!,"This book was a breath of fresh air. I think these grrls are just trying to bring a very boring subject across in a new direction. If you can't understand tongue and cheek, you will no doubt dislike the book and miss their point entirely. It is a shame that those who rated this book poorly was not able to grasp the authors true intent. I am looking forward to reading their second book."
2,"The first words that come to mind are ""duH""...","I'm thanking myself that I decided to take this book of a library instead of shelling out 20 bucks for it. Definitely a disappointment in its entireity.The first words that came to my mind after I'd finished this book were ""Duh"".. everything in it is mostly pointing out the obvious except for the statements like ""Sometimes you need to wear doc martens with a cashmere sweater""... what? who does that?Regardless, if you have half a brain, I wouldn't reccomend this. If you are serious about improving your manners try one of the classics such as those listed above.cheers"
3,"A fun read, but not an etiquette guide","I'm torn. This is a cute read if you are willing to take the authors' affectations as tongue-in-cheek. The Grrls are witty and I cannot fault their actual etiquette advice.However, the book is loaded with instructions on imitating their lifestyle, disguised as rules of etiquette. For example, they include sections on choosing a neighborhood bar, what constitutes a real martini, and their own category of dress code called ""See You In Hell."" These sections made me laugh out loud, but are not even loosely issues of etiquette. I did not sense an underlying desire to show respect for others, which is the basis of etiquette. Rather, it seemed that the Grrls use manners to try to prove their personal superiority and ""good breeding.""Read the book and enjoy its clever criticism of our ""tacky, rude world."" Don't, however, take it very seriously or try to follow its advice, or you will risk seeming like a snob."
4,Millenial Manners,"So good, so perfect, so fitting, I bought a copy for my fiancé. Not because she needs a copy, but because she doesn't. The perfect gift!"
5,These Grrls Sure Are Sassy!,"In light of all the recent tragedy around the world, it seems like maybe a book about etiquette wouldn't be on my reading list. However, while having a hard time focusing on things in general, I'm finding this book to be a delight. This book is not only informative (who couldn't use a lesson in writing thank-you notes, when email notes are appropriate, cell phone etiquette, etc.?), but also hilarious. These two Grrls are wits, for sure. So if you're looking for something to take your mind off things, give this a shot. I think you'll be amused, and you'll learn something along the way."
1,A little too snotty for my blood...,"....Moreso it reads like a high school essay on how to be a snob and elitist. For an alternative read that touts the rewards of humility, compassion and social responsibility (And I don't mean which fork to use for escargot) try - The Art And Power Of Being A Lady By Noelle Cleary - A much better message."
1,Waste of paper; recycling the found copy I have.,"I found this book in a housemate house, someone left it when they moved out, I can see why they didn't want to take it with them. I hope it gets recycled into something with more substance.This book is very dated, I too had to check the publish date and was surprised to find it was a 2001 edition (paperback). It does NOT cover etiquette for interacting with people of different cultural and geographic backgrounds nor does it show any form of communication skills that would help in the real world (being polite and assertive) when we are faced with challenges or challenging people. You can get a lot more etiquette guidance from books such as 'Life Scripts' and 'How to win friends and influence people,' they provide real tools.All the one star reviews are spot on; this book is hard to read, full of poor advice and out of touch."
4,Reissued at long last!,"I've been waiting a long time for this reissue! Dexter had recently returned from Europe and found he could earn a living playing straigh-ahead jazz again in the US. This was his regular working group for several years (when I saw them in 1979 in Lexington KY Kirk Lightsey was playing piano instead of Cables).Dexter is definitely at the top of his game here and the rhythm section of Eddie Gladden, Rufus Reid and George Cables are smokin'! On this CD you'll hear the magic that can happen when a group of excellent musicians have the opportunity to work together on a body of material on a nightly basis. This is NOT a pick-up band.This recording is definitely worth your time and money. George Cables' comping is especially good."
5,great jazz standard,Classic jazz by a classic sax player towards the end of his career. This is one of my favorite all-time great jazz recordings
1,ROOTKIT ON PRESSINGS WITH BAR CODE 827969358122 & RECORD CLUB PRESSING D162084,"Just to clarify a little more about the rootkit:If you have or buy a CD with bar code 827969358122, then you have a CD with a rootkit problem. This also applies to record club pressing D162084.Sony promised to exchange CDs with this bar code, but how to do so is hard to figure out. I'm constrained from providing links per Amazon's protocol, but you can Google ""Sony XCP"" and it'll take you to the Sony site on the XCP debacle. There is a Tech Support email link there, and while they don't say so, it seems formulated to allow owners to submit info for a CD exchange.If you have this CD and ever loaded it into your Windows computer, it's best to go to F-Secure (a reputable computer security company) and download their free BlackLight rootkit detector/removal software. Sony's XCP site also offers a removal tool, but why patronize them if you don't have to?"
1,Not so Tuff,"Had I bought them for any other reason than to reach the $25 supersaver shipping requirement, I'd be pissed. As it is, oh well. My dog destroys tennis balls in minutes -- rips them along the seams. These were no different. In the time that it took me to go in the house to get the sunblock, the ball was torn. As for the smell, there was nothing whatsoever reminiscient of peanut butter. There was a very strong chemical smell, VERY strong, but not even a hint of peanut-y goodness. I didn't go so far as to chew on it, so I can't say that it didn't taste of peanut butter...but it seems highly unlikely. I agree with another reviewer that the Penn tennis balls seem to last a bit longer, and I can often find these at the dollar store, in packs of three."
2,NO peanut butter smell at all!,My dogs love Peanut Butter so I thought this would be fun. There is no hint of peanut butter at all....just a regular tennis ball that is a bit heavier.
2,Ehhh.....!!!!,"My puppies weren't all that excited to get these. I thought they would go nuts over the peanut butter flavor, but there were only minimally amused by the balls. Other than a couple of sniffs, these were completely overlooked by the puppies for other toys."
3,"They Held Up, But My Dog Didn't Care","Like a lot of the other reviewers, my dog is notoriously rough on her toys. As a German Shepherd/Rottweiler mix, she definitely has the power to destroy stuff when she wants to! Unlike the other reviewers though, these balls haven't popped or fallen apart while my dog played with them.My biggest problem with these tennis balls is that she's indifferent to them. I noticed right out of the package that they didn't have any peanut butter scent, and I guess my dog can't smell them either. I've purchased other scented/flavored tennis balls for her before - including some other peanut butter ones she went nuts for. That's the whole reason I bought these, so it's a little disappointing that they're not a ""treat"" for her. We do still play with them, but at my house they're just overpriced tennis balls."
4,Doesn't really smell like peanut butter,"My dog loves tennis balls to begin with, so he really enjoys playing with these. Very durable, but not sure that it smells too much like peanut butter."
4,Great for small dogs,"This little ""tennis"" balls are great for smaller dogs like dachshunds, chihuahuas, pugs, and other smaller breeds. Mine love them. The only issue since they are smaller than normal size tennis balls is they often get rolled under the furniture and my two puppies go nuts when they cannot reach them."
3,My dog liked them as much as any other tennis ball,"My Jack Russell seemed to like these at first, but quickly treated them as no different than the other half dozen or so tennis balls he leaves all over the house.The balls are somewhat smaller than a standard tennis ball, but not super small. There is a bit of a chemical smell that smells exactly unlike peanut butter. My dog didn't really seem to react to the smell or taste any differently than he does with other balls.They are, in fact, tougher than standard tennis balls. They will bounce, but not as well as a standard ball."
1,Tuff? Hardly,"Within ten minutes of playing fetch with my small dog, this ball was coming apart. Under the felt, there are two halves of a hollow ball and they started coming apart at the seam, tearing the felt. Definitely not worth it.My dog wasn't even chewing on it and it started coming apart; I would not recommend for a chewer.The best balls I've found are the Chuck it replacement balls. They last longer but also come apart eventually.Chuckit! Tennis Ball Small 2-inch, 2 pack"
2,Weak Follow up to a dynamic debut album!,"Best known for their 1985 hit ""Everybody Dance"". This group seemed like they might stay on the scene for a while in 1985, but a long singing career wasn't destined to be. This follow up album can be considered a sophmore jinx. I can honestly see why this album did not give them a hit. First of all, There are only 3 songs on this album that I can actually stand. But those 3 songs alone don't give this album a hit. Second of all, they seem to have kind of a different sound then their previous album. This album sounds more cheesy R&B and very little Minneapolis sound to it. I reccomend their first album! Don't buy this album for no more then 10 dollars. It's honestly not worth any higher!"
5,One of the most overlooked films!,"This is a true gem of a story about love and family. Richard Dreyfuss, Holly Hunter and Danny Aiello should have all been nominated for oscar's for their incredible performances in this quiet masterpeice. If you don't shed a tear and feel better about your life after watching this film. You are missing emotion. What surprises me is why this has never gotten released on DVD yet! Buy It! Rent It! Watch it! and ""Fly To The Moon""!"
2,Overrated,"Overacted and inconsistent. The relationship between Holly Hunter and Richard Dreyfuss never makes much sense. And why the father (Aiello) hates Dreyfuss and thinks he's destroying their family is baffling at best. Poorly written, but a few good moments from Hunter. Watch it if you have nothing better to do."
3,Confused,"This novel, like all of James' novels, is about upper class [cultured] people and of their inner drives and outer experiences (in relation to each other). This particular book seems confused to me. James does not have much interest/knowledge in the lower orders and it shows here. He does not have the Dickens/Gissing/Thackery touch and as a consequence this book, which concerns itself with the plight of the working classes, features educated and cultured persons only - regardless of their station in life [i.e. Pynsart and ""the fiddler""]. James even goes as far as to have his only legitimate lower class character [Muniment] receive visits from a black-sheep-of-the-family Lady. He just can't help himself; he must have ladies and the like to write about or he is lost.A less satisfying effort from James."
1,Duskin,"Don't bother with this one. As a huge GLH fan, I couldn't even make it through the first half of this book. Hard to believe it was written by the same author who produced so many of my favorites. Not her usual style at all."
2,An overall average,The album is okay but nancy boy and bruise pristine are the best. But still nancy boy is rubbish compaired to it's (sex mix) on the single. An overall average.
2,Better things were to come.,"I bought this right after hearing ""Without You I'm Nothing"", which is now one of my favourite albums. This one is not nearly as good. Loud, gritty, and almost totally unlistenable. ""Nancy Boy"" is the only track on this album worth listening to, other than that, it's all third rate grunge pop."
1,Horrible!,"The sound quality was terrible, the lyrics were meningless, the melody (if you can call it that), was completely out of synch with everything else. This song isn't worth the bytes it was saved on!"
3,its good but...,"this album is pretty good but... it has a tottally different version of nancy boy on it (clearly the best track on the album) and the ""new"" version sucks alot so it only gets 3 stars but there are a few other good songs on this album stand out songs include: Teenage angst, 36 degrees, bruise pristine and i know. get this cd if u like without you i'm nothing because its quite similer"
4,Separated at birth,"Brian Molko is a mystery. He almost manages to have papers talk more about his sexuality than his music...which is probably the best marketing ploy seen so far in this industry !We, as listeners, however, do not give a damn about Brian's choices in life ; we rather focus on his music...and what a brilliant piece of music this CD is...Clearly detached from your average indie band, Placebo offers a deep, insightful guitar-rock opus, on which Molko adds a sometimes annoying nasal voice. With a second album in sight, this first album is a must for those who do not want to catch a running train."
5,greatest band and album I have ever heard,"I'll go to England this summer, and I really wish, that I will see brian Molko. Many strange teens in Latvia love Placebo.This band is really great."
5,Well worth the extra money for Placebo fans,"If you're a fan of Placebo, this is a must have reissue of their debut album. Placebo's first album is in my opinion one of the best modern rock albums out there. The songs are raw yet melodic, lyrics are fun, and the music is just all around great. Slackerbitch was always one of my favorite b-sides of theirs and is now available on cd here along with a few other b-sides. In addition to all that, you get a bonus dvd that has a few of Placebo's amazing videos on it, plus some killer live performances. I've seen them live, and concerts don't get much better than that. They're one of the few bands that sound just as good (if not sometimes better)live as in the studio. See my other reviews for a review of their video collection on DVD. Like I said, if you're debating whether or not to buy this, buy it! It's worth the money."
4,Things are getting started,"on their First album english trio is practising thair own style - mix of glam-rock,punk,pop and avantgarde with satisfying results.the album is raw,with many heavily distorted guitars and Brian's despaired vocals.still ""Nancy boy"" shows the way where Placebo will go on their later works.there are many classic bands tracks like short but sweet ""Teenage angst"" and angry punk-rocker ""36 deegres"".they are the reason to listen to album.the intriguing 20 minutes long ""Swallow"",""Lady of the flowers"" and ""I know"" are filled with depressing atmosphere and dark layered guitar tecstures.Placebo is definitly one of the most original rock/electronic/experiment bands in whole modern music world.their first album shows how they were making their original sounds without use of synths and electronic in raw three person squad.a must-have for every fan."
4,"Mini horses, big fun",Breyer Stablemates are fun. They are littler than all the other Breyers and I have two. The two I have are pretty and I like making tack for them. They look really cool and you can make magnets and ornaments out of them. Look at the Breyer website to see how. They are more fragile because they are smallir but I love them;
3,Stablemates set,"This set is practical if they were to be played with gently, but Stablemates have a tendency to fall apart. I have had to re-glue a leg already. Their legs tend to be the most vulnerable areas for damage, as well as their tails."
3,How come they never got more popular in the US? Confusing.,"While I like that Five has a greatest hits album, they only had two albums released here in the US in 1998 and 2000. Five did well, but Invincible flopped here. They stopped putting the later albums here. I wished that they were promoted more and could have been received just as much attention as they got in the UK. I think that the edgy look of them put off some people here, so they passed on them after 2000. But I am pleased that they continued to have more hits in 2001 and 2002 overseas and worldwide. I just have to order from Amazon because the greatest hits never came out in the US. I'd like to here what their later hits sounded like. This record is a little confusing to some people here who wished they were more popular here."
5,5ive legacy lives on...,After a amazing debut album and two monster follow-up albums and world wide acclaim and awards and success and millions of fans worldwide..the group five had a career that most groups can only dream of than in 2001 fans found out on live television that they were spilting up...when i learned that 5ive had spilt after 4 1/2 years i was heartbroken..They were the best of the bands out there...their sound was unique...but this collection of there greatest hits is a great tribute to the band...good luck to the guys on all their solo projects. ABS Breen's debut solo album is about to hit in late 2003....Abstract Theory.......
5,Muy buen disco (Antonio-Ecuador),Compre este producto porque siempre me gusto la musica de 5ive lo reomiendo ampliamente a todos aquellos quienes les gusta este tipo de musica aunque ya es algo antigua pero muy chevere! por cierto el producto llego en excelentes condiciones y lo compre directo a Amazon.
4,INTERESTING MELANGE OF MUSIC BY THE FAB FOUR...,"This is an eclectic and interesting two disc CD by The Beatles. It runs the gamut of musical genres: rock, blues, pop, and country/folk. It is wildly divergent in style from their previous release, ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"", as it is certainly less experimental.It has some great rock based tunes, such as ""Back in the U.S.S.R."", which seems to be a parody of the Beach Boys' sound. It contains a good blues based number, ""Why Don't We Do It In The Road"". It also has some interesting country/folk inspired songs, such as ""Rocky Raccoon"", and ""The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill"". They also included a song with a British Music Hall feel to it, ""Honey Pie"", which leaves me cold. Of course, the requisite upbeat pop song is covered by ""Ob-La-Di, Ob La Da"", which I love for its uplifting beat. If you want a pop ballad, you need only to listen to ""Blackbird"". This CD has something for everyone."
1,***New Update***Come on EMI! Poor quality control for this day and age...,"Update: Just received my replacement copy. This time the second LP was pressed off-center, had a lead-in scratch, and was warped.I will not be buying again, as this record manufacturer obviously has no QC currently in place. The Beatles deserve much better than this!I was skeptical about making this purchase after reading some of the reviews.But hey.....It's the White Album!!! I was impressed with the sound, unimpressed by the fact that the 1st LP was a bit warped. The ""jet intro"" to BITUSSR had an annoying scratch and there were quite a few pops all the way thru side 1. Didn't even bother taking the 2nd LP out of the sleeve. I have returned for replacement, giving the record company one more chance. I liked the poster being printed on uncoated paper. The four pictures were not overly impressive...they appeared to be stretched out a bit in the vertical direction. The ones from '68 were much nicer."
5,Awesome (But NOT remastered),"The ""White Album"" is tremendous, but don't be fooled - this version is REPACKAGED - NOT REMASTERED. Save money and buy the original version from Amazon. When (or if) the Beatles' catalog is truly remastered, then break out your wallets!"
4,This album is awe-inspiring.,I have listened to this album many times and I have to say it is probably the most diverse collection of music ever recorded by one group on a single album. Much of the music is very rough but that is what gives the White Album its character. I think it is great.
5,Stay in skool...,"Er, no. I didn't say the Bee Gees were influential. Please print out the review and get an adult to explain it to you very, very slowly. And your claim that the Beach Boys were in a superior class to the Beatles is laughable: did they even begin to match the sheer diversity of musical styles found on this album alone? No respectable music critic would ever subscribe to the theory that the Beach Boys had a more profound impact on music than the Beatles. (PS - Sorry about all the long words.) John Lennon, wherever you are - I'm glad you didn't live to become part of a band that is a bloated, money-grubbing parody of its former self. 'Sad, Sad, Sad.'"
1,a cheesy con job,"When they did Cry for a shadow or In spite of all the danger there was patential, but this crazed out blubber is just a cheesy con job with horrible lyrics and maladies.No wonder it's forgotten!!"
1,GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This CD looks good in a garbage can.....god awful, what were they thinking??? oh yeah, they were wasted when they recorded this crap.....they werent thinking...."
1,the trite album,"this cd is bad. the only song on it thats ne good at all is obladioblada. i love that song.:) obladioblada has touched peeps lifes and theyve spoken: obladioblada is the best work of art by anyone, or anything (that includes woodchucks). lets get reel, the beatles never did ne thing good."
1,I tried but i don't like it,"Everyone I met was going on and on about the White Record and say It was fabbulous, but I must say I tried so hard but I just don't like it, it is K-otic and not so good. I even say it is a discraze.Oh well tis only music.Thank Hew for reeading my review."
1,This album is the definition of overrated,"If you look in the dictionary there it is, The White Album, overrated. It is as overrated as it is self indulgent and boring.People say this is the best double album of all time. Please. Give me a break. Most of the people who say this have probably never heard any other double albums. If you want to talk about great double albums check out The River or London Calling.If you want to check out overindulgence at it's best, try listening to Sandinista! there are some great tracks on there."
1,a cheesy con job,"When they did Cry for a shadow or In spite of all the danger there was patential, but this crazed out blubber is just a cheesy con job with horrible lyrics and maladies.No wonder it's white!!"
2,Beatles are only looking out for the man,"Being a black man in a dominant white world, sometimes it can get hard. This CD could have been great. One problem. They named it the white album, with an all white cover. Why not the black album? What, are they rascist or something? Give me a break, Billy The Preacher and got a barbeque chicken wing stuck on your pinky ring. The Beatles rule all. Give them probs, and buy this album if you want to get down like Diamond Dallas Page did."
1,THE BUGS HAVE NO JUICE!!!!,"The Beatles, simply put, did not rock. When I say rock, I'm not talking about crap like Metallica- I'm talking abut Dyaln, Muddy Waters, Stones, Junior Wells, etc... Beatle fans think that ""Helter Skelter"" is a gritty rocker- that pretty much says it all. The Beatles rock about as much as Mick Jagger without Keith Richards. She's the Boss rocks!"
1,Studio virtuosos. . .exactly,"The gentleman who wrote that the Beatles are studio virtuosos was absolutely right. They could do anything in the recording studio. And that's what I find so sad about the Beatles. They couldn't reproduce their truly good music live. No concerts after 1966! That's just ridiculous and unacceptable for a rock band. And it's why I don't care for this album. While some of the music may sound good, I can't get over the fact that I know it was never performed live. That's a travesty. The recorded music is only a small part of what being a rock band is about. Being a great live band is entirely something else. The Rolling Stones. Led Zeppelin. The Who. These are great live bands. The Beatles just hid for half their existence. That's not acceptable. They can't be ranked with the absolute best like The Who since they couldn't get themselves out of the studio. It's sad. Maybe things would have sounded great live. But we'll never know."
1,not as good as today's music,I don't understand all the fuss about this album. While my Guitar Gently Weeps is the worst song on the album. It shows what little talent they actually had. Mcarthur and Lenin just didn't write any imaginative songs. I think Matchbox 20 is a lot better than the beetels.
2,"Buy ""Exile on Main St."" Not This Overrated Album","""The White Album"" is quite possibly the most overrated alum in history, followed closely by the Beatles ""Sgt. Peppers"". The Beatles, poor musicians, rely heavily upon studio technology to polish their work. One could argue that producer George Martin is far more valuable then talentless drummer Ringo Starr. The Beatles never really toured after their early days, and there was no edge to their music. They only could write bubble gum pop songs like the hideous ""Rocky Racoon"". On the other hand, the Stones would never write such drivel. Their classic ""Exile on Main St."" not only eclipses every Beatle album ever made, but every album ever made period. I am willing to challenge every Beatle fan on this one. I will go as far to say that the Stones ""Emotional Rescue"" is better then ""Abbey Road""."
1,makes me sick,"Helter Skelter just really isn't heavy at all. As a matter of fact, none of their songs possess any real energy or spirit. ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" puts me gently to sleep. If you want real rock and roll, listen to Metallica."
4,You'll go WHITE with joy,"some songs on this album (meaning both of the 2 discs) can get a little weird, but when a song on this is good it's really good. There's somthing for the new age guys in Helter Skelter and somthing funny and charming in Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da. Some songs may even bring a tear to the eye, but thats what makes it so great. i love it and you will to!"
3,Blatant answer to Pet Sounds.,There is some Beatle brilliance on this album of course. It appears very obvious to me though that The Beatles were trying to keep up with Brian Wilson's experimentation & use of various instruments & orchestral sound of Pet Sounds.
3,great cd,"Wonderful cd, prompt shipping, case was broken when it arrived or I would have given 5 stars! Otherwise I was happy."
4,lots of great material,"This could have been a great 5-star single album by cutting out the weaker tracks. Lots of fans are glad to have all 30 tracks though, even if this means pressing skip a lot, perhaps on Rev.#9 and Monkey."
1,uhm is it just me or does this look like a repackaging?,"putting an album in a box doesn't quilay as a box set. this album has only two,that's right two good songs on it. the rest is just garbage.i am just some gay guy who finds the beatles music just plain gay and i don't mean happy. this album is gay just like the beatles themselves. skip this album because it was repackaged. and your gay to like them."
1,This album STINKS!!!!!!!!,Paul McCartney is obviously showing his direction...Pop FLUFF...while John's songs show the raw emotion he was so famous and respected for. His LOVE for Yoko shines in this album. That's the only highlight!
1,Why does everyone love this album?,"I don't see why, because I personally think that most everything else they did was a lot better. This, for the most part, is just weird. Not that there aren't a few good songs. But it's nowhere near the standards of most of their other albums. Strangely, it seems to have won every favorite album poll I've seen."
2,Honey Plight,"This album was too expensive to buy for my older teenage brothers when it came out, so apart from the songs played on the radio I never got to hear it as a piece- until years later.And I listened to it again last week, but my heart is as further away from the album as it ever was. I danced in my hospital bed to She Loves You as a five year old waiting to have his tonsils out, and I love the rest of their stuff, but this album is only worth buying if you share the cost with a half dozen other people."
3,"Ok, but not the best Beatles work","This album,known as ""the White Album"", is truly a turning point in the band's history. We can agree on that. What people can't agree on is whether this album is amazingly good, or mediocre. Well, the fact is, while this album has some good material on it, some of it just sucks. The band were too drugged up at the time of recording, and the tensions within the band were just escalating."
5,Great in every sense of the word,"Most bands who attempt to follow up their most critically acclaimed album produce something mediocre at best. But not the Beatles. Nothing on this sounds like Sgt. Pepper. The variety of songs is breathtaking. Yes, it's obvious they were splintering but it doesn't take away from the fact that they still fed off of each other's creativity and were totally unafraid to take risks. It just may be the most adventurous musical offering of the 20th century. It is bold and thought-provoking while at the same time memorable and timeless. No collection is complete without it."
2,Did You Ever Notice?.....,"Did you ever notice that the best track on every Beatle album is the first one? A Hard Day's Night, Help, Drive My Car, Taxman, Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour, and Back in the USSR are the first songs on each of several Beatle albums.This is the case on the White Album. After Back in the USSR it's all downhill from there. And with two CDs, it's a long, long way to the end.Buy the early Beatles music."
2,Needs some editing.,"What is up with this album? It sounds like they just threw whatever was lying around the studio onto the vinyl. There is no refinement or any edting on this album. It sounds like they just horsed around with a few songs, but never finshed them.Like, Revoultion. This version is slower and sounds like they put the entire tape on, instead of cutting it. It is almost like a bloop[er real. And Bungalo Bill--his name is Buffalo Bill.With [stuff] like this, I'm glad they broke up. Although Lennon's and Harrison's deaths were tragic, and a waste."
2,Beatles 1968,"The cover really says it all. It's blank and empty, just like the thought that went into writing and producing half of the songs. If you like unfinished demos, 60 second jams and unexplained noise, this is for you."
1,Overrated!,"I do like The Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendricks, Pink Floyd, and Yes. I do not like the Beatles; exception: Abbey Road. Most of their music I find simplistic, annoying, and boring.Do you like the Beatles? Do you eat cold cereal for every meal?"
4,"#9,#9,#9,#9","I dock this one star because of all the filler,the obvious and otherwise. But holy smokes the good stuff is absolutely incredible! ""Helter Skelter"",""Glass Onion"",""While My Guitar..."" and everything else (I don't care for Ob-la-di Ob-la-da,I'll take Rocky Raccoon over that anyday) just blows you away."
3,Help! I need an editor!,"""Julia"" is possibly the best song the Beatles ever recorded. ""Why Don't We Do It In the Road?"" is possibly the worst. A five star record is lurking in here somewhere. Why wasn't this pared down to a single disc? Because its raison d'etre was to allow the Beatles to indulge themselves. McCartney puts it thus: ""Come on; it's the Beatles's White Album"". My advice: buy it expecting to hate a lot of it; use your CD's track programmer.Recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
5,"On 1 disc, this would've been the greatest album of all","Consider what would have happened if George Martin had had his way and reduced this sprawling, bewildering album into just a single disc? (The Beatles, in their haste to discharge their contractual obligations, put just about every song they wrote in India on the White Album. Considering this, the overall quality is nothing less than amazing.) OK, here goes: I'm taking a deep breath and stepping into Sir George's shoes. This is what I would have released:1. Back in the USSR 2. I'm So Tired 3. Dear Prudence 4. Yer Blues 5. The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill 6. Revolution 1 7. Helter Skelter (Anthology 3 version) 8. Why Don't We Do It In The Road? 9. Blackbird 10. Julia 11. Revolution No. 9 12. Piggies 13. Happiness is a Warm Gun 14. Good NightI reckon this would have been a contender for the Greatest Rock Album of All Time.Peace & love your music"
5,"If you had to pick just one album, this is it!","Why should you choose the White Album out of every other Beatles' album? Simple...you get more of their music, more of their diversity, and more of their brilliance on this one than any other album. Yes Sgt. Pepper is genius. Yes Revolver was voted the Greatest Album of All Time. Yes many feel Rubber Soul is better. But for a fuller experience (it'sdouble disc) THE WHITE ALBUM is eclectic, experimental, and still filled with the wonderul melodies and harmonies of the greatest and most influential band in the world. Listen to the chorus in Piggies, the pain in Yer Blues, the simplicity of I Will, the enjoyment of Oh-Bla-Dee-Bla-Da, the sheer exhaustion of I'm So Tired, and the good-old-fashioned storytelling of Rocky Racoon and Bungalo Bill.They may not have recorded it together, but it's here forever."
4,Nothing in the Fab canon quite like this,"The granddaddy of all ""alternative"" rock is found here. Deliberately under-produced, inconsistent in its song-quality, but masterfully sequenced (which makes it seem more clever than it really is), The White Album is utterly unique among the Fab Four's output. Some may have this as their desert-island disc, and others might use it as a frisbee or a beverage coaster. But most will likely use that special ""programming"" feature of their CD player (that they almost forgot was there) to hear their ""favorite"" tracks."
3,3.5 Stars. Solid But Not the Best.,"All of the songs are either hit or miss. While My Guitar Gently Weeps is one of their best songs and possibly my favorite Beatles song of all time. Everyone's Got Something To Hide Except Me And My Monkey, Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill, Piggies and Ob-la-Di, Ob-la-Da are some of their songs that I could live without. The Beatles are talented but not when they write songs that anyone could make up like Ob-la-Di Ob-la-Da or other various tracks with no point to them. However the entire album isn't bad and there are some excellent songs like Back In the USSR, Dear Prudence, Glass Onion, Sexy Sadie, Helter Sketer, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Birthday and Revolution. It's got a good diversity ranging from hard rock to acoustic ballads and it's worth owning but it's far from a masterpiece let alone The Beatles best due to the inconsistency throughout."
4,One of The Beatles best albums,"I have had this album on vinyl ever since it came out but until nowI had no way to play it. This album is great! It shows how versatile the Beatles were, it has some music from various genres."
3,"Great Music, NOT Remastered!!!","As always, welll most of the time, The Beatles produced oustanding music. The problem is that this CD is NOT remastered. Just repackaged. Typical record label way of trying to make a buck. You also can't hold The Beatles harmless in this. They should have more control of what is issued in their name. Also not leading on the public to believe that this is remastered. I would gladly pay more for a totally remastered catalog. Including alt. mixes. Do it now before George Martin passes away."
3,Down To The Bits That I Left Uptown,"Yes, it sounds good. It's the friggin' White Album. Is it better than the 1987 CD? Yes, a little, but after listening to each one briefly, popping them in and out of the player, there really isn't a dramatic difference. (Listening on pro studio equipment, btw). The bass and drums sound a bit better. The high end is slightly silkier...but I defy anyone to tell them apart blindfolded. If someone is just now noticing that the bass on ""I Will"" is sung, they haven't really listened to it closely before now, which leads me to this point: most of the reason people are saying it sounds so good is because they are sitting there focusing on it. As to the packaging, it is virtually impossible to remove the CDs from the tight little slits without getting your fingers all over the playing surface. I'm not crazy about digipacks anyway, and in this case, disappointed that the CDs are not protected better. If you love this album, get it, but don't expect miracles."
5,Mindblowing. Spine-tingling. Breathtaking.,"Prepare to be transported. This is the real deal - the one that set the Beatles apart from everyone else. Here they rewrote the rulebook for EVERYTHING that followed. Still the greatest album ever - nothing touches it.PS - I totally agree with the music fan from Kennewick, WA - absolutely spot-on mate."
5,The greatest album from the greatest band,"If I were trapped on a deserted island for eternity and could only have one album with me to pass the time, it would be the White Album. It is the most diverse, interesting and well crafted album ever made. The songs range from rock to country to surfer rock to heavy metal to folk to camp to progressive to the just plain weird. The unparelled songwriting genius of Lennon and McCartney is well on display here as is their obvious differences in style. Harrison also emerges on the White Album and showcases his best song ever ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"". Some may point to ""Sgt Pepper"" as the Beatles crowning achievement, I point directly and emphatically to the White Album.Best tracks: While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Helter Skelter, Dear Prudence, Back in the USSR, Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except for Me and My Monkey, Happiness is a Warm Gun."
5,Masterpiece,"Disjointed? Unorganized? No sense of dynamic?This is the most influential collection of songs in the history of rock. Sgt. Peppers did much to kick start the whole idea of concept albums (tightly held together with a consistent sound and atmosphere). In typical Beatles fashion, they blew that very concept apart in their next breath with The White Album.These are some of the most timeless songs ever recorded. They are ingredients to great rock music - the riffs, the pace, the tempo, the way one track flows into the next effortlessly (not intended?) only goes to show the musical vision that's been developing between the Fab Four over the years (ironic considering this is a time when they were beginning to go their separate ways), and George Martin's genius behind the mixing board.Out of all their albums, this has got to be my favorite."
4,"Not perfect, but essential","It's not perfect (such as Revolver, Sgt Pepper, and Abbey Road), but you obviously must own this. The White Album is famously all over the map, filled with stuff that maybe shouldn't be on there, songs that nowadays would be included in ""Rarities"" compilations. But look at the wealth that IS present: Birthday... While my Guitar... Me and My Monkey... USSR... Glass Onion... Revolution 1... Then there are the gems that don't receive as much airplay, like Yer Blues, Goodnight, and Savoy Truffle. How can you resist?"
3,Good stuff....but they ain't 'N Sync!,"Don't get me wrong, this is some good pop music; it's agreeable, tuneful, and features great singing and cute lyrics. Nonetheless, I just don't think The Beatles match up with some of today's hit music, which includes bands like 'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, Shakira, Jewel, 98 Degrees, and Silverchair. The way I see it, 'N Sync is basically a modern Beatles band....only much better!!Still, I give much props to John, Paul, George, and drummer Ringo, all of whom created great pop when our dads were kids. The White Album may just be their best creation, but it doesn't hold a candle to Sync's last stellar record, ""Celebrity."" Justin Timberlake is today's Paul McCartney, and the rest, my lads, is pure history. Don't miss the song ""Ob-La-De-Ob-La-Da"" from this record, which is all about leaving your problems in the past and having in fun in life - like Sync would do!!!ENJOY!!"
4,Half 'n' half,"Originally released as a two-LP set, the Beatles would have done well to heed George Martin's advice and issue just one LP. As it is, the ""white album"" is part terrific, part trash. For my own purposes, I've recorded a cassette consisting of the better tracks -- what the ""white album"" should have been in the first place."
5,Cheaper than anywhere else,"Of course, the album is great as you know. Amazon has the cheapest price for this album (new). Arrived very quickly with free super saver shipping."
1,i know what i'm talking about,"I only want to thank the man below for pointing out, ""rock was FREE, free as the wide open spaces, wide as the horizon and one's imagination... rock could be ANYTHING."" That sentence is almost as shallow and meaningless as the lyrics on this album."
2,Zzzz..,"Not that everything before it is great, but once you get past Yer Blues on the second disk you can turn this off."
2,White Album,"This is the one with Long Long Long, Revolution 9, Bungalow Bill, Wild Honey Pie, Why Don't We Do It in the Road, and Julia. Don't bother."
2,Not Meant to be taken so seriously and highly overrated,"The Beatles attempted to dispel some of the artsy aura they had developed up to the time of recording this double recording. Anyone who was a good listener AT THE TIME would have noticed that many of the songs (most) are good natured spoofs of then current popular artists;(besides the obvious Beach Boys put on, they have Long, Long, Long (Bee Gees), Mother Nature's Son (Donovan) Helter Skelter (guitar groups, Hendrix in particular), Rocky Racoon (Dylan), Why Dont We Do It In The Road (Tommy James' 'I Think We're Alone Now' reference to 'tumbling to the ground,' etc.) Of course there is original stuff here also, and very good stuff it is! But the point is that this album isnt such a grand work of pop art as some might think, and , with the exception of a few songs-- I'm So Tired being a good example-- this dbl lp was a bit of a toss off that distinguishes itself less on quality than on quantity, variety and it's non-threatening facade."
2,Absolute Trash,"If any other band would have done this album it would have been laughed at, but because it's by the ""great"" Beatles it's considered a classic. There are almost to many bad songs to count, ""Savoy Truffle"", ""Why Don't We Do It In the Road"", ""Honey Pie"", ""Rocky Raccoon"", and many more. If you want true rock and roll try the Rolling Stones' ""Exile On Main Street""."
1,Lennon turns in his grave,"John Lennon must turn in his grave every time someone plays this album or another insane Beatles' fan defends it. This album is obviously all over with Paul's influences. And that's what makes it complete trash. Paul McCartney never had any vision. John did, but you can see that they tried to keep him out of the loop on this album. That's why it's full of long, meaningless, ridiculous songs that don't deserve to be called Beatles stuff. I'm shocked and dismayed that people defend this album the way they do. You people must have had a horrfying adult life to feel that you need to hold on to the lost dreams of your childhood that made you think the Beatles were great. And don't come back at me with some garbage saying that I'm too young to understand. I'm 41 years old. I was around when the Beatles were. I never liked them. I want music that means something. Listen to Bob Dyland and his contemporary successor, Beck. That's where it's at."
2,Beatles White Album 1968,"With four out of the last six reviewers giving the White Album a 1-star rating, I have to step up and defend it. There are 10 good songs out of 30 on here, which is proportionally worth two stars. I will agree that ""Happiness is a Warm Gun"" is one of the worst songs ever recorded, but don't penalize the whole album for it."
2,White Album,"Back in the USSR, Dear Prudence, ObLadDi ObLaDa, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Martha My Dear, I'm So Tired, Blackbird, I Will, Julia, Birthday, Yer Blues and Revolution. The 12 finished quality songs according to producer George Martin that should have comprised the Beatles 1968 release. Had they listened to him, this would have been a 4-star album, and the remaining 17 partially finished songs, demos, and experimentation would have been relegated to Anthology where they belong."
4,Too much filler,"This album would have been better if they had taken all the great songs like ""Dear Prudence"",""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"",Happiness is a Warm Gun"",""I`m so tired"",""Yer Blues"",""Sexy Sadie"" and ""Helter Skelter"" into one cd, but instead we must skip over all the filler.If you want a beatles album with no filler you can buy ""Abbey Road""."
2,33% Pure Beatles,"About a third of the songs on this CD are memorable for their quality. Although many of the songs are interesting, this CD is really tough to get through without hitting the ""skip"" button about 20 times. There is a great album in here somewhere. You just have to find it."
1,NOT JAPANESE BUT RUSSIAN !!!,WATCH OUT WITH THIS NEW SERIES OF BEATLES WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE REMASTERED AND MADE IN JAPAN.THIS NOT THE CASE THIS IS A FALSE JAPANESE MINI LP. THEY ALL COME FROM LETHONIE ESTONIE AND RUSSIA. THE QUALITY IS OK BUT NOT GOOD AS A JAPANESE. THEY ARE A LOT OF DEFEATS IN THE OVERALL PRESENTATION. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT REMASTERED AND THE SOUND IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL EVEN BELOW. ALSO THOSE CDs ARE NOT IN CLOSEABLE PLASTIC ENVELOPPE AS ALL JAPANESE CD. EVEN BRAND NEW THEY HAD SCRATCHS AND ARE NOT CLEAN.AS A COLLECTOR OF JAPANESE MINI LP WHO BOUGHT THIS ONE I ASSURE YOU THIS IS A FAKE.
3,good but not great,"This album is okay...but it's no their best. Check out ""Rubber Soul"", ""Revolver"", and ""The Magical Mystery Tour""."
5,The White is All Right,"This is one of my favorite Beatles albums! Unbelieveably beautiful melodies and strange little ditties go hand in hand with raw, roots rock n roll classics in this sometimes funny, sometimes eerie but always excellent set. If you can get past the creepiness of John Lennon singing about warm guns and the Helter Skelter bit you'll probably enjoy this album almost as much as those of us who have been listening to it since 1968."
5,This album is beautiful,"I have the original LP version of this album and it is by far one of the best pieces of work that I have ever heard before in my whole life. My top favorite songs are ""Helter Skelter, Long, Long, Long, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Why Don't We Do It In The Road, Yer Blues, Piggies, Revolution 9, Blackbird, Rocky Raccoon, and Happiness Is A Warm Gun."" These are my top favs all in that order. The whole album is wonderful though. It is a true art form."
2,Not much better,"They had a chance here (hear) to make this better than the original CD release but instead of remastering the multitrack tapes they chose to send the original two track master through a modern AD converter and call it good. So the bass is a little better, but that's about it. They could have cleaned up the individual tracks and really made a difference with ""The Beatles"" but they didn't.The mid period albums have shown the greatest improvement from remastering. Revolver is the stand out.Overall I'd say that the remastering effort come's up short of expectations. ."
5,"Really gnarly stuff, dude......","I'm 12-years old and in 8th grade. While I listen to stuff like Rage Against the Machine, Smashing Pumpkins, KoRn, Limp Bizkit, and other metal/alternative bands, the Beatles were, hands down, the best band of all time. I am collecting all their albums, and the White Album is a true gem. It may not be the best album by them, but still very influential......."
5,Review Overkill,"If you are looking for favorable reviews of this album to be the deciding factor on a purchase then you must be one of those people that still mean to get around to reading ""The Great Gatsby"", attending a Renoir exhibit, or seeing a Hitchcock film. Buy the damn thing, it's great."
5,Basic Beatles!,"This album\CD just goes to prove that even the best get tired of all the B.S. It also proves that the Beatles had a lot of unfinished music that they did not know what to do with. Anyone who bought this album was the ultimate winner because even though some of the tunes are rough, the Beatles showed us another side of them that maybe other groups would not want the public to see."
2,warped record,"My records were both warped . This is probably due to heat during shipping, I am ordering another in replacement. I had the same problem with my yellow submarine copy but not with revolver"
5,"The Watusi, The Twist, The Best!",A fan favorite and the best stuff they ever did. They put everything they had into this one and the music speaks for itself. It had something for everyone but it is everything for the true fans. The most diverse record ever made. From avant-garde to ragtime to rock to folk to show-tunes etc. etc. etc.
5,Best album of all time,"I'll keep my argument brief on this one. 2 records, 4 sides, and on any given side there are more amazing songs than most other notable bands have in their entire careers. The White Album is the standard by which all other albums should be judged, yet despite this, it never ranks in the top 10 of most Best 100 albums list. This is the greatest band of all time at their creative peak. It is raw, yet pollished, humorus, yet serious, dark, yet promising with 30 prefect songs and no album cover or title that could possibly do it justice."
3,A Hit-and-Miss Affair,"The Beatles could not have possibly topped ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart Club's Band."" ""The Beatles"" has some fine numbers--""Julia,"" ""I Will,"" ""Rocky Raccoon""--but it also has self-indulgent studio noise experiments like ""Revolution 9"" and the abhorrent ""Wild Honey Pie."" The first disc is actually quite good, but ""The Beatles"" loses steam on its second disc."
2,"Beware, NOT remastered.","Very disappointing. A 30th Anniversary Edition which only adds a few pictures and a small version of the original poster to make it different from the original CD release. There is no new remastering done to the music. This is a shame because this album includes some of the finest Beatle music ever made. Also, since there is no jewel box, the packaging can get beaten up. The 30th Anniversary deserved a lot better than this. If you already own the CD, I wouldn't recommend this edition. It's an expensive way to get a miniaturized poster and a few pictures."
5,A Must Have Album!,"This record is the Beatles most diverse effort, and with such a large collection of songs here it is an album that everyone will like. There are some great McCartney songs and pieces here, from 'Blackbird' to 'Helter Skelter'. However, there are some McCartney songs here that I prefer skip over, such as 'Obladi Oblada', which John Lennon thought was a stupid song, and Rocky Raccoon. I think the best songs on the 'White Album' are Lennon's, from the brilliant 'I'm So Tired' to 'Revolution'. However, Revolution#9 should'nt be there in my opinion, nor should Yoko's singing. There are some good contributions from Harrison and Ringo, too. Overall, an excellent record that is as important to own as Revolver and Abbey Road. I'ts excellent musically, however I don't think it's quite as good overall. 9.5/10"
4,"Good Album, has a little bit of everything","This I believe is a good album, my favorite tracks in this album are ""obladi-oblada"", Rocky Racoon, Helter Skelter(Really good song), Back in the U.S.S.R., Glass Onion, Dear Prudence,Those would be my favorite songs, but this is a great album. Really recommend buying it"
5,One Of The Finest Albums Of All Time!,"I prefer this album to Sgt Pepper, being much more consistant. This music is some of the finest that they've ever recorded. This may be considered to be the beginnings of their solo careers but the Fabs flex their creative muscles and everything they've learned up to this point shines through. Some day, Capitol needs to get this classic album remastered and the CD booklet needs a great deal of annotation, perhaps by Marc Lewisohn or the Beatles themselves. Those reviewers who deny the influence of the Beatles are missing the boat. Without them, Hendrix, Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, etc may not have been possible because they would not have been allowed as much artistic control. Buy your copy today and buy it again when it is remastered."
1,ding dong DUNG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Anyone hear Jo Roepcke moaning about indigo flyers?That's because this is without doubts the ugliest recORD in the hole world, it is worse than best of Boney M and Sananda's eagles jazz combo.No-go music, don't buy, be forewarned! It is dangrous and emptyheaded"
2,The Brown Album,"My friend Charles wrote his Uni' dissertation on this album...during his research he discovered that it the record co' got boared of the tedius nonsense coming out of J P G n Ringo and were going to release this in a dark brown cover and call it ""The S**te"" album.Charles got a first, which is kinda funny, you know, first, number one...pooo!!!"
1,inexcusable and mean,"I maybe ten but I herd so muc music from Frank Cappa to and with the Roaling stones, but this reccord is really:a) inexcusableb) repettattivec) boringALL IN ALL A VERY WEAK EFFORT BEST AVOIDED!!!!!"
1,could have been an EP,"It's pretty bold for the Beatles to release a double album, considering how shoddy their work really is. Instead of releasing just one disc of mediocre songs, they're torturing us by releasing TWO. 90% of this album is basic filler and it could have been trimmed down to just an EP with 4 tracks. I like the song ""Birthday"" but hated ""Dear Prudence"" and ""I'm So Tired."" Well, this whole album is ""tired"" and is another reason why the Beatles are so overrated."
1,The most overrated band in history,"I can't believe how much praise the Beatles get. Nobody seems to realise that they were just another flash in the pan British Invasion pop group from the 1960s. They were untalented then, and they're untalented now. I don't think they're anywhere near as ""influential"" as everybody says they were. They were just juvenile acting, silly looking, and musically amateurish. Their success had more to do with marketing than anything else. I'm sure I'm going to get a lot of ""Not Helpful"" votes from all you Beatles loving hippies, but somebody has to speak out against the BEatles. All the praise and respect they get is completely undeserved, because they had no talent. All they did was dress in silly looking clothes, silly looking hairstyles, and whip togeather 3 or 4 chords and add a bunch of brainless lyrics over them. No talent there. Even children's music like Twinkle Twinkle Little Star and Mary Had a Little Lamb take more talent to perform than a Beatles song!"
1,What is the fuss about,Why do people fuss over this dated pop group. Michael Jackson's THRILLER blows every Beatles album away as true pop music genius. Only music arty farty music critics continue to ramble on about their music. For the need of something to say.
1,The Most Overrated album EVER!,This albums is just bad. Beatles fans may think it's inventive but it's really nothing more then a copy of the music that was coming out at the time. The only listenable songs are poppy sap like the rest of their hits. The rest are bad immitations of Dylan's lyrics and the sound of The Rolling Stones. The Backstreet Boys of the 60's.
1,More Wrigley's from the ultimate bubble gum group,"I'm sorry, people, but The Beatles just don't cut it. They are the cause of the obnoxious pop music which plagues us today. It's a shame people don't recognize it. Sure, it's amusing to listen to once in a while, but it lacks depth. The superficiality is disturbing. Lennon and McCarthy just weren't up to the task of creating enchanting songs. If you want real, meaningful music, go LED ZEPPELIN."
2,VERY Average ONE OF THE MOST OVER-RATED ALBUMS,"though I Respect The Beatles for Their Song-Writting&Sir George Martin as a Producer this Set is very Average.The Lyrics are Down-Right Bad.The Music is for the most Part Uninspired.I Dug While My Guitar Gently Weeps,Back In The U.S.S.R,&Revolution 1.but Overall The Music seems Formula Driven.&Compared To Dylan,James Brown,Motown,HENDRIX,etc... they seem Played Out.this is one of the Most Overrated Albums Ever."
2,"Production, Layout, Content Could Have Been Better","The production of this album left something to be desired as the splicing in and overdubs just aren't as clean as they could be. (On ""Birthday"" for example, Paul's ""I would like you to dance"" followed the the cut off ""...aaance"" from the overdub). Also, Paul missing the snare and hitting the rim on the backbeat into to USSR.The layout and song progression just seems random, with slow songs sandwiched between rockers.Finally, there's just too much on this album. The better 15-16 songs would have been great with the remainder put on Anthology for Beatle fanatics.Overall - 2 stars at best."
1,get off your high horse,"This is without a doubt the greatest album ever if you live in a world of lullabies and skiffle. These lyrical geniuses as they are so often described are so soley because half-wits give meaning to their nonsensical lyrics. It's kind of the magic eye of musical lyrics. If you listen long enough and ingest enough dope maybe you'll find meaning in their words after awhile. That nursery rhyme entitled rocky raccoon should be renamed "" The Curious George Goes to the Saloon Rag"". But if ever notice, beatles fans are the same sheep that make it necessary for fast food joints to offer value meals. Simply, they need to have someone else decide what would be good to eat. Well I say this, here's another pellet for you if your crazy enough to buy it but we already know you will!"
1,overrated influence,"You've got to be kidding me when you say that no music today would be possible without the Beatles, right? Please. The Beatles were about as important as the Rutles. The truly important influence on today's music was Jimi Hendrix. He brought guitar playing to new heights and kept people interested in the blues. That's why we get bands like Stevie Ray Vaughn and Double Trouble, Van Halen, Nirvana, and the like. Great bands. Unlike the Beatles. And this White Album is a greatly titled piece: White. Empty. NOTHING. I hate to read people rave about this trite trash and think that it's the end-all-be-all of human existence. It's ridiculous. Listen to real music."
1,"Oh, this is boring","I don't want to like say anything mean, but I didn't like this album. It doesn't make my top ten. The number one album of all time is Third Eye Blind, ""Third Eye Blind."""
3,Help me! Help me! I need an editor!,"""Julia"" is possibly the best song the Beatles ever recorded. ""Why Don't We Do It In the Road?"" is possibly the worst. A five star record is lurking in here somewhere. Why wasn't this pared down to a single disc? Because its raison d'etre was to allow the Beatles to indulge themselves. McCartney puts it thus: ""Come on; it's the Beatles's White Album"". My advice: buy it expecting to hate a lot of it; use your CD's track programmer.Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
2,George Martin Knew BEST!,"I have always had the feeling as talented as the Beatles were, they wouldn't be half the success they were without their great producer Sir George Martin. He acted (while they were listening) as their quality controller as well as an amazing producer. And the result was some of the finest albums ever made. That is up until this one. 30 songs on one album is far too many. Only about one third of this album is quality. The rest is filler. Tracks like Dear Prudence, Revolution, Back In The U.S.S.R, Its Your Birthday and My Guitar Gently Weeps, are among the best tracks. But if they had taken the wise advice of Sir George and released this album as a single album with the best 9 or 10 tracks. It would've been better for them in terms of critical acclaim. And this album would be up there with ""Revolver"" (their finest album) and ""Rubber Soul"" and ""Sgt Pepper"". Sometimes less really is more."
3,Not the best,"I find it hard to appreciate this album, and I am surprised by the amount of positive reviews it gets. The songs on this set often bypass any discernable melody and are often quite raw and abrasive. There are some good ones though (thankfully!)Stand out tracks include: Back in the USSR, Blackbird, I Will, Julia, Mother Natures Son, Revolution 1, Helter Skelter,but some of the material is so banal, it sounds like the pop music of today. I'm thinking of Wild Honey Pie as a case in point"
2,Cut the Dead Weight,"Come on, guys. I thought you were above that. You're supposed to be the greatest band in the world. Why must you record 30 songs and only about 10 actually have substance? I would have expected better.First of all, I don't want to pay 30 dollars for two discs when I could just burn the several good songs off the Internet. Those good songs are incredible, definetely Beatle material, but what's with songs like Wild Honey Pie that scare me more than entertain.Cut the dead weight: make one crisp CD and it might be one of their best."
5,A Classic,"The White Album is a classic that is unbeatable by ANYTHING you see today in music.Interestingly, the quality of the Beatles' music increased as they began to fight with each other. This album contains some of the best music they ever committed to tape. You simply cannot beat the likes of Blackbird, I'm So Tired, Honey Pie, Savoy Truffle, and the other thirty tracks on this album.Even the tracks that most people don't consider the better of the songs on the album are, in my opinion, quite good. There really is no weak track on this album; even Revolution 9, which is an autobiographical John song, is quality.I can't say enough good things about this album. If you want to experience cream-of-the-crops Beatles material, I highly recommend this album."
2,Track drops on 2009 version,"Of course this is one of the greatest albums, but I have problems with vocal tracks missing on several songs. You can faintly hear the track, but this is serious. Very disappointing!"
5,one of the Beatles finest!,"""The Beatles"" (aka. White Album) has, by far, the most variety. This was the album where their ideas started to expand, thus, you get some hard-rock songs (Helter Skelter) and some mellowed-out serenades (Long, Long, Long) Many Beatles fans will also be happy with the fact that George wrote more material as compared with previous albums. The lyrics are also another element that compliment this beautiful work of art. ""Piggies"", in my opinion, serves as a prime example of this. While listening to this album, take notice at how the next song to follow will be noticably different from the last. This great setup shows much effort, therefore earning a 4-star rating. Please go buy this album-- your music collection looks bad without it."
5,Amazing,"This could very well be The Beatles' greatest achievement (aside Side 2 of Abbey Road and Sgt. Pepper); a sprawling, visceral album. Sure it's chockful of fillers, but the fillers are all milked of their potential. Isn't that what's really important?"
4,Okay,"I am an avid Beatles fan but was disappointed in this cd. I haven't heard the White Album since I owned it on vinyl. Revolver, Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour were much better productions. However, I love the Beatles and didn't mean to be rude. They are the Beatles but other cd's are far better. It happens! Still worth a buy since this is a classic."
2,road hazard,Don't put this in your cd player while driving. you spend more time hitting the skip button than listening to the few good songs.
1,get me a fifth,"I'll be honest. I liked 6 songs on this album. Thats one in five. Therefore, it deserves one star out of five."
2,Beatles,"This album is really interesting to listen to from beginning to end - about twice. After that, the repeated plays for most people revolve around the strongest 10 or 12 songs, including Back in the USSR, Revolution, and While My Guitar Gently Weeps. Those songs comprise about a third of the album, thus the rating of 2 stars. A better way to buy these songs is on the 67-70 Greatest Hits album, which admittedly contains a lot of weak Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour songs, but they are better than the other songs on the White Album."
2,The Beatles 1967,"I guess I don't really need another reviewer to interpret what the Beatles intended, or how songs were supposed to sound relative to one another. I really don't like songs like Wild Honey Pie, Revolution #9 or Rocky Raccoon. I think this album is a bit of a clean out of the closet. It's too bad, because while there was an abundance of songs on this album, there is a shortage of completed work on Abbey Road.Unless someone was in the studio with the band, it's pretty arrogant to claim to know what was intended - I can ASSURE you.2 stars, and I'm being generous."
4,something for everybody,"there's enough on this massive album to appeal to everybody. different people will like and dislike different songs, but at over 90 minutes long there is so much material so you will find"
5,The Fab Four go solo,What can you say about this album that has not been said about a billion times?!! All four members doing there own thing and putting all together on a two record set. What I love about this CD is how you can see each members personality comming out without over shadowing the other members. A must have without even thinking twice.
5,TYPICAL BEATLES...GREAT!!!!,"The Beatles were true musical innovators and thus changed the landscape forever. This album is just another example of this most diversified group of musicians. It goes from ""wedding"" type music, ""Obla Di Obla Da"" to music that allegedly makes people insane, ""Helter Skelter."" Oh yes, as in typical Beatle fashion, it also covers everything in between. A must have for anyone who has ears!!!"
5,A GREAT ONE!!,"I agree with the 5 star reviewees,the one star posters are musical idiots,who wouldn't know great music if it bit them in the ass!Get the anthology 3 if you wanna hear many interesting demos of these classic tunes.I love this album even 'Revolution 9',which is one of the most hated Beatle tunes.This is my 4th favorite lp of 1968,behind THE WHO SELL OUT by The Who,BEGGAR'S BANQUET by THE STONES,WHITE LIGHT/WHITE HEAT by The Velvet Underground and this great album.If you are a Beatle fan and don't have THE WHITE ALBUM you are missing out.I was too young to enjoy their music then.I was just seven years old.Today I'm 42 but still think the 60'S were a fantastic musical decade. I get a kick when younger people say how much they dig Beatles or any other 60's music.It was reaaly a special time.Really the last time we were innocent."
5,White Album!,"Man, what else could be said about the white album. These two cds are just phenomenal. There isn't one bad song, everything is great."
5,Dear Truck Driver:,"And what's so baaaad about putting on a dress and picking flowers? If you FEEL LIKE DOING THAT, THEN DO IT! (It may be your feminine side trying to come out...)"
1,Don't Waster Your Money,"Wait until the master tapes are used with 24 bit mastering this cd adds nothing over the older CD version. This is a major rip off in my opinion. I am sure this review will not be released because it might hurt sales, but then I brought this CD with my money and I feel this needs to be known. Write EMI/CAPITAL and demand better.Phil"
5,"""It's the Beatles (freakin') White Album...Shut up!"" - McCartney","The Beatles (self titled) / aka-""The White Album"" (1990 CD): OK, so what if this sounds more like a collection of unrelated singles? There are some great Beatles singles here. It is still a Great Album. If you don't have it, you ought to get it."
4,Hugely Under-Rated,"One of my personnal favorates, an under-rated album from the greatest band in the world, ever. Contains some of the greatest Beatles songs, I'm So Tired having to be one. A must for those fans who like The Beatles sound to be a little more roar and less produced. Probably sounds more live than anything off Abby Road, ignore the press releases and buy this album."
4,THE WHITE ALBUM,"The White Album is a very good record by a very good (if sometimes overated) band. Songs like Back In The U.S.S.R, Helter Skelter & Rocky Racoon are really good. But songs like I`m So Tired & Birthday are a bit lackluster. But then there is Revolution 9 which is incredibly influential and superbly put together. Overall a good album but not as good as its reputation."
4,"BIG, BAD, BABBLIN' BOB SPEAKS","What a great album! Highpoints: ""Sexy Sadie"",""Happiness is a Warm Gun"" and ""Piggies"". Low point: this album drove Charles Manson (Marilyn Mansons dad, I think) to multiple homicide!Again, a great album and a must have!Unless of course you're pre-disposed to multiple homicide...you probobly should leave this one alone . Forget about those Marilyn Manson albums also."
5,Classic Beatles,"Packaging and contents even better than the original issue in 1969! Faithful stereo reproduction - still breaks my heart that Eric Clapton played the guitar solo on ""Weeps"", but it's still great guitar!"
5,Great vinyl edition!!!,"To all the bad reviews here, I don't know what the problem was about. My copy was perfect, nearly flawless. The sound was great and the packaging was awesome. I'm from México, and this album was very hard to find on vinyl for me, so I was very happy when I knew that new reissiues on vinyl were going to come out. Now I can have The Beatles albums on vinyl without paying too much for them."
1,Defective Vinyl,"I bought (and returned) three copies of this record. All of them had quality problems of some sort -- warping, pops/cracks, static and weird background noise, distorted sound. After the third defective one I decided to return for refund, I give up on trying to get a good copy...This is sold and priced as an audiophile release- not even close!"
5,A Must Have for Beatles Fans!!!!,"This is one of my favourate Beatles albums.It is one of their best.The 2 discs are loaded with great music.It includes such songs as ""Back in the U.S.S.R., Ob-La-Di,Ob-La-Da, and While My Guitar Gently Weeps. Now, for something a little strange.At the end of ""I am So Tired"",there is some weired mumbaling, very interesting, eh?But besides that, this is a must have for ant Beatles fan!!"
5,An astonishing album marred by its own ambition... 4.5 stars,"The white album is an undeniable masterwork, but it is flawed. As The Kid pointed out the album could definetly use some trimming, not to the extent he suggests but the album has its low points, unlike Abbey Road or Rubber Soul which are perfect from start to finish. Don't get me wrong I absolutely adore this album and so many of its songs are benchmarks, but if a few of its songs were cut out (who seriously listens to revolution 9...) what would remain would be arguably the Beatles best."
5,Is There a Need for Reviews?,"If anyone has come to see if a reviewer will say this is the greatest Beatles album of all time, forget it. All of them are great. There is not one I can fault, nor is there one better than another, except to say that Abbey Road is the culmination of all the years of their experiences and definitively who and where they were at the close of the band's existence.If you don't have this album and you like the Beatles, buy it.One last note: the assertion that Eric Clapton played the lead for ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" has no fact to back it up. I urge anyone who even likes the Beatles to examine multiple examples of Harrison's work commencing in 1968 until his death. He was very expert in slide work and the lead bears his unmistakable signature."
3,Beatles mediocre songs,"Most of the songs on this album have a good beat but have little depth. In the late 1960`s McCartney offered to sign Don Van Vliet to a record contract, which he refused. The Beatles had potential - Van Vliet could have motovated them to be a great band."
4,Best rock an roll The Beatles ever played.,"The white Album was capstone of The Beatles remarkable 7-ish years as a group. It allowed for individual experimentation by each group member as they prepared to digress into their own seperate ventures. The only thing that holds me back from giving 5 stars is ""Revolution 9"". Like Paul, I was dissapointed in the conclusion of ""The White Album"""
5,"kind of a joke, maybe it was the way they wanted it...","I have really enjoyed owning the White Album from day one. My dad started me on the Beatles' early stuff but this double cd set really shows what the beatles are capable of in every spectrum of music. best songs? well, Glass Onion, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Sexy Sadie, and Helter Skelter...also, if you get the album, listen to Cry Baby Cry, very well done tune.But you will need to keep an open mind when you listen to this album; much of it is done with tongue in cheek and there is a lot of weird production...(Honey Pie);Over all though, this is an outstanding album and if you want something ultra original from the Beatles, get it today."
5,What if...,"Imagine if The White Album was cut into one fantastic album. I think the tracklisting would be something like this:1. Back in the U.S.S.R. 2. Dear Prudence 3. Glass Onion 4. Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da 5. While My Guitar Gently Weeps 6. Happiness Is A Warm Gun 7. Martha My Dear 8. I'm So Tired 9. Blackbird 10. I Will 11. Julia 12. Yer Blues 13. Mother Nature's Son 14. Sexy Sadie 15. Long, Long, Long 16. Revolution 1 17. Cry Baby Cry 18. Good Night.What do you think? Too long? I think that would be neat and a very strong album, but of course some other good songs would be missed."
2,At least my Mother's Gravy used to move about,"Having a modest but effective sound system I was surprised to be not impressed by this version of my fave Beatles LP.It sounds lumpen, bass laden and somehow charmless. Just another darn moneyspinner for the suckers on the line."
1,Awful,I dont care if someone think I am crazy for saying this but I never felt there were any oustanding songs on this album..Skip this please because when they made this album they were past there prime.
2,It's Alright,This CD is alright. Back In The U.S.S.R. is pretty good. The Cd is all over the place and pretty self indulgent on the part of Paul McCartney. This is definately The Beatles on their decline.
2,"When 'dear prudence' is a highlight, you know it's bad","This is possibly their most overrated album (which is saying a lot). Of the 93 minutes running time, about 3 minutes is worth hearing, and even those 3 minutes are scattered among the songs. If ""dear prudence"" is one of John Lennon's ""best ballads"", according to the clowns at allmusic.com, then Mr Lennon is probably the most overrrated musician of the century."
5,My Favorite Album; cuz there's so much to choose from!,"This is a great mellow album! Ya can tell it was recorded at a time when the Beatles were COMING DOWN from their 'mystery tours'. Some 'trippy' whymsical stuff is heard along with the rock and roll Beatles. Even Revolution #9 isn't too bad. That's good to blare on Halloween. My favorite songs from the White Album are: ..'Bungalow Bill', 'Happiness is a Warm Gun', ""Rocky Raccoon"", 'Don't Pass Me By'and 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps'. This is not an album for beginning Beatles fans. Start with Please Please Me or Help!. Save the White Album till ya get to know them better."
3,The Decline and Fall,"Here's where they fall apart. The songs are intentionally slight, and hearing such talented musicians expend their energies on ""Rocky Racoon"" or ""Piggies"" (or ""Revolution No. 9"" or ""Honey Pie"" or ""Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da,"" etc.) is depressing.If you want to hear this sort of thing pulled off, check out Bob Dylan and the Band's ""Basement Tapes."""
