3,Read also the Smith/Moody book,"This one has great detail, and a lot of information, but I still think the Smith/Moody book ""AURAS"" is still THE one to get you to see the Aura immediately."
3,one track only,"The only selection to my liking on this cd is the one performed by George Shearing, who is the only one who succeeds in giving us an arrangement in which the original melody is enhanced, not lost."
5,birthday gift,I got this leotard for my daughter's birthday because she does gymnastics. The quality was great and the sizing was true. The outfit fit her perfectly.
5,Huge little storage,"It is amazing how much storage you can have in a problem-free littlecard. It comes with softwre, and the Palm just recognize it inmediately without doing anything. I love this card."
1,Misleading,"It's too good to be true and written by a proven dishonest person.Proven background of the author's dishonesty can easily be obtained from publicly available information from the Commodity Futures Trading Commision. In particular, CFTC Docket No. 02-08 was provided for the public to view here:http://www.cftc.gov/files/enf/02orders/enfangell-order.pdfWould you want to follow the advice given by the person addressed in that CFTC Docket? hmmmm, don't think so"
1,total fraud,"Guysi bought angells book couple of weeks ago, and read it thouroughly,its nothing but a complete nonsense and full of rubbish.Mr ""TRADER"" (george Angell) tries everything in this book to lure you to the idea of buying his so called ""LSS Day trading systems""If you dont believe me then go to CFTC (commodity futures trading commision) web site and find out about him.He has been severly charged for his misrepresentation of his Lss system and has been awarded a penalty for mail order fraud.Good thing i only read the book and didnt trade according to this mongrals ill fated ideas..."
1,"Very, very poor book","This book is unfocused, and what little information there is only describes a simple ""two-leg"" trading system. The author claims that this system is proven by historical data, but doesn't give this data. A publisher like Wiley should be ashamed to put out such trash by an author who has been sanctioned for scamming investors in the past. For the cliche (but true) trading advice given in the book, you'd be better of just re-reading Market Wizards."
1,a reader,"I have read and studied many trading methods over 10 years. I am curious about this author so bought a few books from him to read. It's a waste of time and money. Totally agree with those who voted 1 star for this author. Trading today is not so easy and too general as this author described in his books. So, newcomers be aware!"
4,Helpful book,"I find the book enlightening. It can be a bit repetitive, and some of the information is not that well organized. However, the content is there. Some of the pages have very concentrated content, you have to read them several times because there are so many concepts presented. Apparently the pay-by-mail LSS system he sold was marketed somewhat dishonestly, but that doesn't mean he's not an excellent trader. I find this book helpful in identifying mistakes and broadening my understanding. It is worth noting the book focuses primarily on futures trading in its examples, however the concepts apply to trading in general. This book is definitely not a waist of paper as some of these reviews seem to imply. I purchased this book after reading in it in a bookstore, if you doubt its content read in it first. Just my thoughts."
5,Compassion: A reflection of the Christian Life,"An outstanding, excellent book just what I was looking for -the real meaning of compassion and how to be compassionate"
5,How to be a better person.,"This book is one of the most important How-To books ever. There are a lot of books out there offering to make us feel better, or to solve our various problems and anxious concerns, but few books give us concrete ways to give back of all that we've been given in our lives. This book simply, powerfully, intelligently, and at times, overwhelmingly, shows us how to relate the service and compassion of Jesus' life, and the love, patience, and generosity of God, to our own lives and the world around us. It answers the question of our human purpose in the world, and it suggests a way of being in this world that supports and encourages others and fulfills the will of God. This book teaches us how to serve God by daily and humbly serving man. This book is all about love. I know I will read and reread this book for the rest of my life. It is that essential and full of truth. And it is that challenging."
4,Embracing,"I read this book during a service work project sponsored by Notre Dame. I refer back to it often, rereading about the origins of the word ""Compassion"" and how Christians understand it with respect to God. I've referred to the book often in my other studies and recommend it."
5,I love this album,"I love Paul Simon so I love this album.It ""describe"" Paul Simon's works very good. I love it, especially ""America"", the different ""Bridge over troubled water"" and ""Kodachrome"". If anyone thinks something else ,E-mail me."
5,The Straight Scoop,"After looking for quite some time at Target and online, I bought this straightener for my 13 year old daughter. I wanted to spend less than $50 and stay away from ConAir because it has gotten such mixed reviews. My daughter loves this hair straightener! Unlike our old one, this one heats up and cools down quickly. Besides being cute, it does a very good job of straightening. My daughter enjoys the curling function, too. Sometimes she straightens the waves and curls out of her hair, then flips the ends. She rated it a 5 and said it's great!"
5,Hubby Loves it!,Hubby got this air hose reel for his compressor. He's rigged it up in his garage overhead and now has his air-hose handy at all times. He's very pleased with his new gadget!
4,High quality at very reasonable price.,"Surprisingly High quality at very reasonable price. Works good after two month of extensive use. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because of mounting bracket design, which makes it very difficult wall-mounting by one person."
2,Another careless record company disaster..,"This compilation of early Japan material succeeds in featuring a number of rare 12"" mixes (European Son, Life In Tokyo..) but is totally spoiled by the sad and unfortunate fact that the *entire* cd was mastered in **MONO** . They should sack the responsible individual, withdraw all copies of it and offer free exchange for those unfortunate enough to have purchased this. Just my opinion.. : )"
3,little too clean,"i never fell too deeply into Japan's arty take on synthesized pop music. Sylvain's voice is certainly wonderful and full of a detached kind of charm; but most of these songs bore me. my favorite tracks are the songs ""Love Is Infectious"" and ""Fall In Love With Me"" which cut with their angular rhythms and spikey post punk guitar with a sounds that slightly resembles a more pop-friendly Bauhaus. a little more venom spread out over the remaining songs would have helped me to enjoy this a little more."
2,Overpriced and poorly designed,"This document holder is flimsy and overpriced. The only way to keep it from tipping under its own weight it to stick it to the desk with the adhesive strips provided, but I want to be able to move it around so this isn't an option. Definitely going back."
2,Quality,I was surprise about the cheap material that was used to make the product. Especially for 50 bucks! The directions were poor about how to put the item together. I am seating at my desk looking at it. I wonder if I should have paid a 100 dollars for the bigger one.Thank you dlw.
4,100 Block Grid Stamp,"The stamp shipped quickly. Sturdy construction. I use it in homeschooling for graphing, counting, tenths and hundredths. Though the individual squares are small, the overall shape is large enough to require either rubbing it along a traditional stamp pad or using an oversized pad."
5,singing hapy feet,"when I got this I couldnt wait to open it,the only thing that bothers me about this is that it takes 7 batteries and they cant be re-chargeables. It doesnt say why not. But its a cute toy with sings and rolls back and forth with remote and plays happy feet taps."
2,This is not up to its advertising,"These clamps work great for a while but the design make this clamp useless after a few time of use. The u joints are held in with a rubber strip and its falls out, the clamp is useless when this happens which is all the time. Instead of using rubber strips to hold the clamping pads together, they need a lock ring installed. The straight pin that hold the screw handel together will back out and again the clamp is useless. ShopFox really needs to look at this and make some of these changes and then they might have an excellent clamp for putting face frames together"
2,"Won't clamp anything over 1/2"" and not at right angle!","The manufacturer's box (there are no other instructions with the clamp) claims to clamp up to 7/8"" thick material. The original Amazon website states that the mfr claims 3/4"" thick material is supported. However, in the unit I received, the clamp won't clamp anything over 1/2"" material (maybe 5/8""), but what good is this?Worse yet, when I did try some 1/2"" material, the tool clamped it, but it was not at right angle. It was slightly skewed and, after several attempts to 'learn' how to reliably get a right angle, I finally gave up and returned the clamp. I won't be buying another from this company."
3,Ghost Dance,Adequate information relative for our need to promote greater understanding from Native American perspective of what it was really all about.Thank you
2,A little boring,Feels a little like a left-over collection of unused recordings. Not at all as high a standard as e.g. 'Best of Django Reinhard'. Not worth buying unless you want to own all existing recordings with DR.
2,not a very durable unit,"The plastic used is not durable and thick, I have another rubbermaid toolbox and the plastic used in the other one is thick and not as brittle. This thing is for cheap hobbyists."
3,The last... and probably weakest of the canon,"The tracks on this, Dire Straits' farewell album, are pleasant enough... but the group just seems exhausted and drained of energy, in spite of a six year break after 'Brothers In Arms'. It marks a return to the style of the first two albums with a laid-back style and shorter songs and the new expanded lineup is impressive, however Mark Knopfler's talent for excellent lyrics appears less sharp. The result is an album that didn't produce any hit singles and did not really meet expectations.By no means a bad LP but not the band's best work, and the subsequent tour was somewhat disappointing as well. At that time Mark Knopfler just seems like a musician at the end of his life, and Dire Straits disbanded in 1995. However you should get this one in order to complete the set of studio albums from a group that were undoubtedly quiet achievers, but put out some brilliant music during their peak."
5,dire straits on country,"Even a art rock band like dire straits can beat Garth Brooks at his own game. this record shines with supberb production and outstanding songwriting. if this is the last record by these guys, whos originaal membership is down to just Mark K. and John I. than its a wonderful testimony of their impact on pop and country."
2,Dire Straits&#65533;the lounge version,"With songs like the insipid ""Ticket to Heaven"" and the lounge sound of ""My Parties,"" (a song that tries to have the sarcastic flair of a Randy Newman but fails miserably) On Every Street gives the listener Dire Straits at its weakest. Knopfler's guitar sounds buried under the mix, and he affects a bass voice that just doesn't register. Even songs that could have proven to be winners like ""Calling Elvis,"" the title track and ""Heavy Fuel"" seem to have been recorded while the band was in a state of depression. This is one of the band's worst recordings and along with Love Over Gold the one most easily skipped by the casual fan."
2,Something clearly is amiss,"I just broke out my copy of ""On Every Street"" yesterday as I had not played it in years. Alas, absence has not made the heart grow fonder or the music sound better in this case.After a terrific run of exceptional recordings that still sound relevant and crisp, Dire Straits finally crashed to earth of this tired sounding album. Too many songs here sound as though Dire Straits is now content to tread water and remake its own songs.The aptly titled Fade to Black should have been the closer on this recording, as something clearly is amiss---perhaps the Heavy Fuel had water in it---and Mr. Knopfler and company prove they are mere mortals here."
1,Worst Dire Straits album much to last guy's chagrin.,"After releasing five great studio albums, Dire Straits released On Every Street which turned out to be its swan song. The album apart from Calling Elvis was awful. Heavy Fuel was a joke! This album only sold a fraction of what Brothers in Arms sold whilst Metallica's self-titled and Rush's Roll the Bones were slaughtering the competition. Even Pink Floyd's A Momentary Lapse of Reason is better than this!"
1,Dire Straits an extremely overhyped band,"How can anyone like Dire Straits so much?.I really think that they are overhyped.Sure their self titled debut was decent,but not the others.Heavy fuel is a joke.Right now I am trying to play COMFORTABLY NUMB on my guitar as it has this terrific solo from David Gilmour.Get The Wall from Pink Floyd instead."
3,"it's good, but ...","I am a big fan of Dire Straits and I own all of their albums, but I disagree with most of the reviewers above. ""On every street"" NEVER can keep up with the older DS-albums. I was pretty disappointed after having listened to this album a couple of times. For my taste, the older Mark Knopfler drifted off too much towards Country Music (especially with ""Golden Heart""). Where is the straightforward Guitar Rock of the first DS-albums? ""On every street"" is certainly worth the money, but compared to ""Dire Straits"", ""Communique"", ""Brothers in Arms"", etc... it is a pity, but unfortunately they have gone beyond their zenit after ""Brothers in Arms""! However, they are still one of the best bands ever!"
4,SOLID DS ALBUM,"The same tried & trusted recipe; Knopfler's Dylan-inflected vocals, very mature songs about mature matters, their trademark guitar style. Memorable compositions include Calling Elvis, The Bug (a philosophical reflection -- ""sometimes you win, sometimes you lose""), Ticket To Heaven -- a country-flavoured observation on cheapo religion, and How Long, also country, but very hummable. Lyrically, the title track and My Parties are the best but somewhat lacking in the melody department. All in all a solid album and should be in every Dire Straits fan's collection."
3,The final straw.,"Dire Straits ""On Ever Street"" #12 (1991).Dire Straits' 6th and final studio offering ""On Every Street"", would come out 6 years after the mega selling ""Brothers In Arms"". I guess 6 years was too long a wait, because the fan base disappeared by this time, (it sold 1 million copies). The songs weren't as sharp as they were in the 70's and 80's. Here are the keepers from my point of view, ""Heavy Fuel"" #1 MSR, ""The Bug"", #8 MSR, which was covered by Mary Chapin Carpenter on her 1992 album ""Come On Come On"". And the fairly successful single ""Calling Elvis"" #3 MSR, the rest of the album just falls into a country-middle of the road pap. Guy Fletcher filled in on keyboards and Vince Gill guested on the album. Nice little career 1978-1991."
1,"DIRE STRAITS-ANNOYING,REPULSIVE,DISGUSTING AND REVOLTING",I HATE DIRE STRAITS.THEY ARE AMONGST THE MOST ANNOYING BANDS AFTER GREEN DAY AND FOREIGNER.ON EVERY STREET IS ASTONISHINGLE ROTTEN.HEAVY FUEL IS THE WORST SONG EVER MADE AFTER WAITING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU.TOO BAD ZERO STARS ARE NOT AN OPTION.GET PARANOID FROM BLACK SABBATH INSTEAD.
1,"DONT LISTEN TO THE 5 STAR REVIEWERS,ON EVERY STREET SUCKS",I DESPISE DIRE STRAITS.THEY ARE ALMOST AS BAD AS FOREIGNER AND NIRVANA.ALMOST ALL THEiR ALBUMS ARE HUGE DISASTERS.MARK KNOPFLER IS ONE OF THE MOST OVERRATED GUITARISTS OF ALL TIME ALONG WITH KURT COBAIN AND SLASH.DONT BUY ANY ALBUM FROM DIRE STRAITS AND FOREIGNER PLEASE.ONE STAR.RECOMMENDED ONLY TO PEOPLE WITH A POOR TASTE IN MUSIC.BUY DISRAELI GEARS AND WHEELS OF FIRE FROM CREAM INSTEAD.
5,BEST SONG BESIDES MONEY FOR NOTHING!!,Heavy Fuel is one of the most brilliant rock songs of all time.It's the best besides Money for Nothing. We all need you to listen to both songs today.
5,Absolutely Awesome!!!,I can't stop playing this CD!! It is so catchy and very inspirational. I can't believe this is their first album!! I am so impressed by the talent of these two up and coming stars. This is the kind of music the whole family can enjoy. Please release another CD soon - we will be the first to buy!!
2,not as good as the old one,"I think that this cd was not as good as the other cd. The songs just aren't the same. I never listen to this cd and i listen to the other one more. theres nothing wrong with it, in my opinion i just think that the other cd was better. its not recommended by me. Its not worth getting."
5,Superb follow-up to No Name Face,"If you were wondering that Lifehouse would fall victim to the sophmore jinx that afflicts so many new bands these days, take heart. STANLEY CLIMBFALL is a worthy successor to NO NAME FACE. The band has grown more confident in their prowess, and it shows in a set of songs that really seem to shimmer and breathe.My favorites so far are ""Spin"", ""Wash"", ""Anchor"", ""Just Another Name"", and the expansive ""The Beginning"".This CD is going to stay in my CD player for a long, long time to come."
4,A little disappointed,"I am a huge Lifehouse fan. I loved every track on their debut cd ""No Name Face"". I anticipated the release of their newest cd ""Stanley Climbfall"" for months. Yet, when it was finally released I was a little disappointed. I just couldn't get into the lyrics and melodies like I could with their previous albulm. Although the cd does have a few good songs, it just didn't blow me away. I truly hope that their next effort gives me something to gush about, but until then ""No Name Face"" will be the primary albulm I listen to."
3,Tried to hard,"I picked up the first Lifehouse album when I went to the U2 midnight sale for ""All that you can't leave behind"" after listening to U2's new one I popped in No Name Face and was blown away. I quickly lost interest in my precious new U2 album and played No Name Face constently. Every song is great. I couldn't wait to get the Stanley Climbfall CD but I have to be honest as a HUGE fan of the first CD I didn't think the new CD flowed well as an album. There are some great songs but not enough for me to give it the 5 stars I hoped it would be. I thought they just tried to hard. Jason's voice seemed forced at times and his lyrics get a little repetitive. I hope that they can do better next time. Until then I will remember them from their No Name Face album."
5,Stanley Climbfall Rocks!,"Lifehouse has done it again. They've made another great CD that's better than any other band's there is. Stanley Climbfall is a must have! So many people are missing out. Grab a copy of the CD, as well as No Name Face and read the lyrics and get a feel for how the music is, you should soon be a huge fan!!!! Awe-some CD, GET IT!!!!!!-Ryan Mitchell BYU#1"
1,Major Letdown...,"""Stanley Climbfall"" had some big shoes to fill, a job that it failed to accomplish. This is nowhere near the Lifehouse quality that was shown on ""No Name Face"". Talk about a Sophmore slump! The first singe ""Spin"" is pretty good, as is the title track. The best track on the record is ""Take Me Away"", it is BEAUTIFUL!!! Unfortunately I can't say the same for the rest of this cd...that's junk!"
5,Miss this album and you are the one missing out! AWESOME!,"Well,I have got to tell ya, I am just loving this album. I keep listening to it and find myself hooked. I have read reviews adn while I would say I like all but maybe 2 songs, there are two that stand out the most. Take Me Away is so stirringly beautiful, you can't help but be moved. Definitely could be used in a movie or primetime show.THE BEST THOUGH- is by far ""AM I EVER GOING TO FIND OUT"". This song is soooooooo well put together. Catchy Catchy Catchy. That is all I have to say. The lyrics are great and the music has so many changes in it, but they all blend together to make this rocking tempo that just gets you going. Excellent driving music. It's only a matter of time before the radio stations play it, as this this has mega hit all over it. If you think Spin is good, you ain't heard nothing. ""Am I Ever Going to find out"" will blow you away!"
4,Just as good as the first album,"Lifehouse broke out in 2001 with their single ""Hanging By a Moment"" and then they seemed to disappear from the spotlight. With no other hit singles from their 2000 debut, I figured they'd become one hit wonders. Even though I am skeptical that this album will sell well, the band has managed to put out another great album. I think the albums first single ""Spin"" is much better than ""Hanging By a Moment"" but I am obviously in a minority. My absolute favourite song on the album is ""Wash"" - Jason's voice is so emotional. I really do love ""Stanley Climbfall"" but the band failed to try something new with their new album. This almost sounds like a continuation of their first album and I was expecting a bit of a twist. Still, this is a wonderful album and I hope the masses will be able to appreciate it as well."
5,Lifehouse does it again!!,"I'm a HUGE Lifehouse fan. Everyone I know knows that. When No Name Face came out, ""Hanging By A Moment"" blew me away, and I've been a fanatic since. After I found out about Stanley Climbfall and waited TWO LONG AND PAINFUL MONTHS for it to come out, I was the first one in the music store the day it was released, and walked out 3 minutes later with a long-awaited, outstanding peice of work. I was NOT disappointed. Not only is Stanley Climbfall an extraordinary collection of great songs featuring great lyrics, vocals and guitar work, but it surpasses Lifehouse's preceding album by far, with its originality, maturity and depth.I'm extremely proud of my boys for doing it yet again. Check out the tracks titled ""Spin"", ""Stanley Climbfall"", ""My Precious"", and of course, my personal favourite ""Sky Is Falling"". I recommend this album to anyone who knows good music when they hear it."
5,lifehouse lives on,"I normally don't buy CD's without listening to any of the songs, but since I loved No Name Face beyond what my limited vocabulary can explain, I took a risk and bought this CD. I will never doubt Lifehouse again! Stanley will not be escaping from my CD player for quite a while; the lyrics are absolutely moving and the the melodies are quite catchy. Right now, ""Sky is Falling"" is my absolute favorite song (both #3 and the bonus acoustic version). There's just something about it that moves me. I always feel like I relate to their songs, and the vocals are so soothing. This is definitely a must-have."
5,Lifehouse comes back even stronger the 2nd time around,"This album is awesome!! Lifehouse has developed their own new sound which combines the sounds of their previous album, along with some Coldplay and U2 type of stuff blended in. There is not one single weak song on this CD. ""Out of Breath"" is in my opinion Lifehouse's new ""Hanging By A Moment"". ""Take Me Away"" has a really nice tune with awesome lyrics. "" Some of my other personal favorites include ""Wash"", ""Stanley Climbfall"", Anchor"", and ""The Beginning"". Buy this album, its definitely worth it!!"
3,How long did it take them to make this album?,"I can just feel the unhelpful votes coming because I gave Lifehouse three stars, but I have to be honest. Before I came onto this site, I didn't even know anyone knew this album was out. And I know the guys have skills, but they have weird ways of using them on here.""Out Of Breath"" is a good song, but it sounds just like ""Hanging By A Moment""; and when you stop to think about it, so does ""Spin"" (but not as much). ""Anchor"" is really overproduced, while the chorus to ""Wash"" could stand to be rewritten. And while I'm talking about the lyrics, Jason tends to say ""All I want is you"" repeatedly in a lot of the songs.None of the songs are bad per se (well, maybe they could've left ""My Precious"" behind), but the songs sound so much like their previous work that it makes you wonder where originality factors in. (By the way, whoever wrote the lyrics in the liner notes needs to pay more attention because a lot of them are wrong.)"
3,A bit of a mess (2 and a half stars),"(2 and a half stars) I was a fan of ""No Name Face"", but was ready for something completely different. And that's what I got. Although not in the way I thought it would be. It's still evident that Wade is a good songwriter, but the musicianship in muddied at times and the vocals are weak. There are a few really great tracks (Sky is Falling), some mediocre ones, and some plain old bad ones. I listened to this several times, hoping it would grow on me, but it just never did. Here's to hoping Lifehouse takes their time putting out CD #3 and captures our imaginations again."
2,Disappointing,"There's no climbing, only falling.I just bought this CD, and I was looking forward to hearing it. But I was thoroughly disappointed.Mainly, the songs this album lacks are the ones that made ""No Name Face"" a great album. Like, for example, slow, melodious, meaningful songs like ""Trying"" and ""Breathing."" There was none of that here. It was all clanking noise. Very un-harmonious. Too bad. If you're thinking about buying this, I would say save yourself some pain, unless you want pointless noise to listen to. Buy Coldplay Live instead."
2,What downloading is for...,"I love the two singles, Spin and Out of Breath, so I thought I'd download this first and give it a try. As much as I hate to give an album with meaningful lyrics such a low rating, I have no other choice. Sorry to all you hardcore fans, but this didn't cut it! I tried to like this album and I still couldn't get into a lot of these songs! There's too many slow, sleep inducing tracks! I can get the same thing from my relaxation CD!! Not even the bonus track How Long is worth the extra money! I gave this two stars for the five songs I like: Spin, Sky Is Falling, Am I Ever Gonna Find Out, Out Of Breath, and Take Me Away. My advice: Go ahead, if you're a hardcore fan! If you're just a casual fan like me, just download it or borrow it from a friend! And while you're at it, try No Name Face instead! So far, I've only heard sound clips, but it still seems like a better album than this!"
5,This cd is Climbing to the top of my most liked charts,"After having heard the first album by Lifehouse. I knew that i was really diggin everything this band put out. From the first song ""Spin"" to the last one. I didnt skip a track on this cd. The majority of times even on a very good cd. I will do this at least once. But that's not the case with ""Stanley Climbfall"" and its also a cool name for the title of the CD as well.I'm looking forward to Lifehouse's next CD due out in March. I'm sure that i will enjoy it if not more than i did the previous two. There's a new Lifehouse fan in here and that's the end of it."
3,A disapointing sophmore effort - despite the growth...,"Yes, Lifehouse has grown up as a band. The music is much, much more interesting than on the first album. The problem is that they took a few steps backwards in the songwriting and vocal department.While on No Name Face the vocals and emotionally charged lyrics were the obvious strength, they take a blatant backseat to the instrumentation on this album. It is almost as though the lyrics were an afterthought. Nothing so horrible as to deserve specific mention, but after the wonderful debut album, I expected more.The music is very, very good. A lot more powerful, and interesting throughout. The problem is that all the great musicianship is overbearing, and ends up drowning out the vocals on most of the songs.Having said that, this is still a good album. It does show that the band is taking steps to improve their music, and it makes me very, very excited to see if they can put it all together on their third album."
5,One of my most favorite albums,"This album and No Name Face are the best albums that Lifehouse made. I'm not so crazy about their newer albums -- too ""poppy"" and mainstream. The lyrics and music in Stanley Climbfall move me like very few albums/songs do."
5,Lifehouse Stanley Climbfall,Awesome CD. Love Lifehouse. Great listening whether you are a Christian or not. Very inspirational. Have all of their CD's and everyone of them are fantastic!
4,awesome music,"I really enjoy lifehouse. I saw them in concert, great live show! I did't have the stanley climbfall cd, so I am glad I got it. It sounds good."
5,"Well worth the wait, excellant follow up to No Name Face","Been a fan when they were Blyss, but the band seems to evolve better and better. Jason definately writes awesome lyrics. It is hard to choose a favorite song because they are all so good much like No Name Face. Excellant follow up guys thanks for the new listening experience."
4,Lifehouse matches 'No Name Face' with this latest,"The charm and sentimentality of this band has always been its selling point, and 'Stanley Climbfall' perfectly showcases this strongest suit. With the first single ""Spin"", fans of ""Hanging By a Moment"" will be happily satiated. New listeners will get a fresh taste of the easy-to-swallow melodies and guitar riffs that have become associated with the band.Though this album covers little in the way of new lyrical territory, listeners can hear the beginnings of Lifehouse's musical evolution. It is subtle, to say the least, but the change seems to be suggested. Perhaps in the next album?"
5,Incredible,"With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved. Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad). The album's first single, ""Spin"", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy). A few other tracks to note are ""Anchor"", which is a powerful song, ""Am I Ever Gonna Find Out"", which is incredibly catchy, ""Take Me Away"", another very powerful one, and ""The Beginning"", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.Lifehouse has not let down with ""Stanley Climbfall"". I strongly recommend it."
4,Clearly a great CD!!!,Lifehouse hasn't changed a thinh since NNFace!!! That's a really good thing!!! Soft rock at its best.
5,Lifehouse has done it again!,"Stanley Climbfall is another great CD by Lifehouse! Spin and Just Another Name get your body moving, along with many of the other songs. I love the heavy hitting guitar riffs... crank it up!"
3,Just doesn't match up,"This is an alright CD, but it doesn't even compare to No Name Face. The only songs that even caught my attention were ""Spin"" and ""The Sky is Falling"". I was also a little bit disturbed because on the acoustic version of ""The Sky is Falling"", it sounds like Jason Wade had never sung in his life before. It was awful!!! Which begs the question, is Lifehouse really that good, or are they a studio creation? I don't know, all i know is that this album doesn't even compare to their debut. If you are a die hard Lifehouse fan, go ahead and buy this, you might like it. If you're just a casual fan though, I would save my money."
3,"Good, but not as mucho as the first one though","This cd has a lot of passion in it, and some very good lyrics, but they souldn't have gone so confident, they had to try harder to be better or at least be the same as No Name Face, but it's still good."
4,You get hooked on this music,"The first time I listened to the album, I thought it was just OK. After I listened to it two more times, I was completely hooked. This is a great album. The music is strong and well written; the lyrics are meaningful. My only complaint is that at times you cannot understand what the lead singer is saying. I get completely annoyed when I have to refer to the printed lyrics to understand what is being sung. However, the album is well worth the price of purchase. Give it a try."
5,"Catchy, thought provoking music","I'm not a die hard Lifehouse fanatic, nor am I Christian (what lead singer/songwriter Jason Wade mostly writes about), but I know good music when I hear it. Yes, it's catchy, but it's so much more than that. The lyrics are very emotional and thought provoking - you'll hear a song five times and analyze it differently each time. The lyrics don't have this hit you over the head obvious theme to them - they can kind of be analyzed however you want. This album is exponentially better than No Name Face both lyrically and musically. Sure, maybe the songs aren't as radio friendly as those on No Name Face, but I think that's a good thing because we get much better quality songs here. Give it a listen - if you like emotional music that makes you think, you will not be disappointed."
5,Best of the Lifehouse Albums,"More mature than the self-titled album and superior (or at least equal to) to No Name Face, the unfortunately overlooked Stanley Climbfall album remains the best work by the band to date. Smoke and Mirrors? Okay. But it's not in the same league as this disc. Sure there's no pop single to jump out and grab you; if you're into that sort of music check out their other albums. What the band did deliver here is a deeply layered and introspective work with well crafted songs, brilliant lyrics, and thought provoking rock that will make and endless road trip not seem like such a bad thing. After years of listening, it's still one of my favorite albums of all time. Highly recommend."
5,One of my forever favorite records.,"It's a fabulous Lifehouse record, such a great follow up to the first one. I still listen to it a lot. Having the real CD is important to me, in this digital era where everything is virtual. Thanks Amazon!"
4,Great tunes.,Great CD! Lifehouse is great! Spin is one of my all time favorite songs! Here's the track breakdown:1.Spin=A+2.Wash=A3.Sky is Falling=B-4.Anchor=A5.Am I Ever Gonna Find Out?=A6.Stanley Climbfall=B7.Out of Breath=A8.Just Another Name=A+9.Take Me Away=B+10.My Precious=A11.Empty Space=B12.The Beginning=C+
5,Best ever,"If you listen to the whole CD, you will like every song on it! It was the 1st CD I ever bought. It was worth it. Now I want to buy every future CD they will ever make."
5,Lifehouse Rocks,"""Stanley Climbfall"" is a great second album from Lifehouse.This CD has an entirely different sound than ""No Name Face"", a bit more mature sound, not so ""studio"" sounding, while still reflecting a lot of emotional and spiritual thoughtfulness. It is a very positive CD and leaves the listener asking for more!My personal favorites are Anchor, Spin, In the Beginning and the falsetto by Jason Wade in My Precious is wonderful!!"
5,A+ Album!!!!!!,"Lifehouse is back with their follow up album to ""No Name Face"" called ""Stanley Climbfall"". With the albums charming lyrics and Jason Wades deep, angelic voice, it retains that classic Lifehouse sound. The first single off the album is 'Spin', which is out of this World! The album is excellent and I highly recommend it."
3,No comparison to No Name Face,"I am a big fan of Lifehouse album No Name Face. I liked it because of it's hard style. Stanley Climbfall is a good CD, but many Lifehouse fans the loved the previous album will find this album to be too slow and soft. The first track is great, but I feel it's the only song that really stands out."
2,Climbfall Falls Flat,"Being a huge fan of the great craftsmanship that went into their previous album ""No Name Face"", Stanley Climbfall could not compete in the least.The songwriting was very dull, the production boring, and the album continuity flat. Nothing of the great creativity that went into songs such as Everything and Breathing.Not worth the money. Better luck next time to Lifehouse."
1,Don't bother with this garbage,"This album pales in comparison to no name face. No name face is without a doubt a five star album, but these songs are somehow horribly inferior. The lyrics are still emotional but sung without the same conviction of no name face leaving the songs sounding dull and boring. I was expecting so much more after their debut brilliance. Forget this, get no name face."
3,Stanley climbfall - Did lifehouse climb or fall?,"I am the hugest fan of No Name Face... heard every song millions of times, but Stanley Climbfall left me questioning, Did Lifehouse base this cd solely on the fact that people liked ""Hanging by a Moment""? I think they did, because every song is similar to ""Hanging by a Moment"". Not saying that song was horrible, but NNF was an any mood cd, where as, SCF wasn't. I hope they get more songs like ""Everything"" and ""Breathing"" on their next album. Lifehouse deserves many props for their work and Jason Wades voice is Awesome. One last thing, my personal feelings on ""Hanging by a Moment"" can be summed up in one word: OVERPLAYED!"
5,Great Deal and entry for 3D BUT...,"Just FYI, e-frontier habitually sells this same package on eBay for $79, 100 bucks cheaper."
3,DVD is worthless,"The content of the book is very good and detail. However, the DVD content which consists of 2-3 minute movie clips on the chapter objects is a waste of time. The DVD could have been better being packed with sample tests, vocabolary lists, and a HTML Version of the BOOK."
5,Exc ellent,"I purchased this book, read it and went through all the questions and passed on the first shot. Plain and simple. Being new to security, this is what I needed to really learn the content. This book did exacly what it said it would do, help you learn some entry level security content, pass the entry level security+ exam from comptia, and give you a fundamental background so that you can then move on to much higer level certs like the CISSP."
2,Well.......,"Let's start with the positive sides of this book:1.) The overall book layout is good.2.) Explanations are pretty easy to understand.Now, move onto the negative side:1.) Doesn't cover a lot of stuff in the exam. In my 2 exam experiences, around 25 questions were not mentioned in the book.2.) The exam simulator is on the internet. Personally, this is bad because I like to do last-minute study before exam.3.) Questions in the book are good for checking whether you understand concepts covered by the book, not good for the actual exam.4.) The 2-hours DVD instructor-led course is not so good, either.Well, these are just my personal opinions on this Security+ study guide."
1,Failed Exam - Not enough info and to many errors,For these types of exams one expects to read such a book and pass however this was not the case for both me and my friend. also too many technical errors.
4,Good exam coverage and decent real world coverage,"I would recommend this book along with the Exam Cram 2 book. The coverage of exam points was very detailed, and I remember several questions that seemed to be very close to word-for-word from the Syngess book (I am not suggesting foul play by any means). If you had to study from one source (I would not recommend doing so at all), this would be the book I would suggest.If you also want some real-world coverage, this book does a good job with examples, etc.Having said that, I found the DVD instructor-based training virually useless. I thought it would be great to have that extra, but the guy really does nothing but read the bold print, do a little explaining, and answer some obviously staged questions. Also, the practice exams from this book are not very good. I recommend the exams from Exam Cram 2."
2,Where did these reviews come from?,"I also got this book based on the reviews, read it three times and just failed the exam. The questions in this book were not even close to the real exam as the reviews suggest. There are also no fancy diagrams on the test and I found the ""DVD training system"" usless for exam fucused study. My question, did the people writing the reviews here use a diffrent book to study?I am confused here..."
5,"Complete coverage, matches CompTIA","This is a great book--covers all the objectives that CompTIA has listed, and in great detail (sometimes more than you need for tha exam, but who can quibble with that!). The DVD was worth the price of admission--I'm pretty sure I could have passed just watchign that and not even using the book. But I did use both, sometimes together to study and I found it a great way to learn."
5,Wish I had this for the beta,"I took the beta exam before this book came out and I just missed passing (ok, I failed). I got this book right when it first came out, because I really do want to get the cert, and I've beenr reading it ever since. After taking the beta and reading this book, I really feel like I'm prepared to pass. Thre's so much stuff on the exam, it's hard to know everything. This book talks about all of the test objectives and the questions in the book really help. They are hard. If you get these right you will pass. The DVD is pretty cool also. You can only read for so long, but if you know you need to keep studying you can throw in the DVD and relax a little bit."
4,pretty good book,I read 5-6 books and passed this in my 1st go. Syngress was the first one that publich a book for Security+ and they have deifnitely done a good job. Their wireless section is too much for the actual exam but there's nothing to lose to learn more. Generally i will recommend this to anyone going for the exam.
3,Several errors...,"I've found more than a few errors in this book, e.g. wrong port numbers, decimal dot placement, wrong answers to the test questions and the ordinary typo's. I'm also not too fond of the general layout and items get repeated quite a lot. I studied it thoroughly and failed the exam by 8 points. Some questions in the Security+ exam where definitely NOT covered in this book. I'll try again but with another book, one that is recommended by CompTIA.Marco"
4,Im Security+ certified!,"Thanks to this book, Im security+ certified. This book does contain a lot of information that isnt on the exam, however much of it will come in handy in my day-to-day job. That said, the book does cover all of the objectives of the exam - and covers them well."
4,not as bad as people say it is,"well i am not one of those who follows people blindly i hear the stuff for myself, people visualise kane as a hard spitting battle mc so he didnot cut it with this album but just listen he has made a smooth album, it just shows the mans flexibiltyif you do like BDK i suggest you add this to your collection and finish and respect the great big daddy kanePeace out..."
3,down hill from here,"I wouldn't say it was off the hook. BDK hit his peak at ""taste of chocolate"". this has a few funky ... tracks. the beat on git bizzy is funky ... and the title track is something to get with ur girl to? but beyond that it's all down hill form there. a shame too. BDK was one of the best artists of the time. the hardcore gangsta revolution killed him as well as cold chillin records going out of bizzness. (thank the diabolical biz markie for that one. gotta ask permission before ya sample bro!)"
5,Entertains grown-ups as well as grade school age kids,"You can't go wrong with the PopCap brand. I purchased this to keep my kids occupied during car trips, waiting to be seated at restaurants, etc. This card possesses the ever so popular bejeweled as well as many other games that hold my 8 year olds and 10 year olds interests."
5,Listen up action fans!,"I have had the pleasure of viewing this three-pack of action movies, and let me say this: There is no better sound than DTS (for now). If you love Mel Gibson or the Lethal Weapon Series, this is the one to get. Sure there's a four-pack of movies, but I've viewed them too, and well, there is not the quality that you get with this three pack. Trust me I fought tooth and nail for the other set, but viewing them both showed the four-pack is just not as good as this set, especially for the price. Suggestion: Get this set then get Lethal Weapon 4 seperately if you want. It's cheaper in the long run, too!"
3,Don't expect the contents to look like the picture,"Rubbery, cereal smell, but sliced thin, pan fried, with onions, garlic, green peppers and cumin it makes a decent fajita. I'd buy again."
3,OK,"I bought the computer to print basic texts, and I chose it because of its low price. The printer prints text nicely and has no problem with colored images that go along with the texts. I am no printer expert, but the black ink went away very fast. I used up the black ink after perhaps 70 pages. Remember, the black ink cartridge is perhaps one third the size as the black ink in any other printers I have used. I do not understand why Epson decided to make the black ink the same size as each individual colored ink cartridge. And plus, the black ink is like $20 dollars!!!!!I also don't like how the paper has to be left on the back vertically, most HP models let you put the paper flat at the bottom of the printer."
2,"It works, but...","My C60 just bit the dust and I wanted another so I could use up the extra ink cart's that I've been storing. I suppose the C60 has been discontinued so I went for the nearest thing - the C66. Compared to the C60 this printer just creeps and I thought it would probably be faster. I have had less trouble with nozzles clogging, but it is still only several weeks old and this could change with the next priting. My biggest complaint is that it will not accept a standard 4 1/8x 9 1/2 envelope feeding landscape. It goes exactly to 8.5 wide so the envelopes must be fed portrait which now screws up my envelope printing program as it will not print portrait. I thought it would be a new and improved C60, but it is actually a step down. It will also run a sheet of blank paper before it starts printing my CD labels for some reason and this is a major waste of time. I wish the C60 were still available honestly."
1,NOT Compatible with Macintosh!,"Well, I just wasted $70. To my knowledge, this is the first USB printer from any manufacturer that is not Mac-compatible. Even worse, it seems that Epson made a conscious decision to make this printer incompatible with the Macintosh just to force us to spend more money.Quoted from the Epson.com website:Q: Why isn't the Epson Stylus C66 compatible with Macintosh computers?A: Epson America works closely with Apple to deliver digital imaging products that meet their customer's needs. Based on feedback from Apple and its customers, Epson determined that Mac users were not interested in lower-end printers such as the $69 Epson Stylus C66.Many other Epson printers are Mac compatible, however, for a general-purpose inexpensive Mac-compatible printer Epson recommends the Epson Stylus C86 which retails for $99."
3,Slow with good quality.,It tells you that it prints at 17 pages per minute but that isn't true. It takes a very long time to print out anything from text to images. It you arn't looking for speed then I would suggest this printer. The quality is what you get for the buck. So if you need nothing fancy this is the best printer for the price.
2,"Basic printer, poorly executed","The Epson C66 mostly does what you'd expect from a $60 inkjet printer, but doesn't do anything exceptionally well. So I would give it 3 stars. Except for two things. One, the draft print mode is VERY faint and basically illegible. Two, it's VERY slow to start printing the first page. I'll keep using mine (at least until the ink cartridges run out), but I wouldn't recommend buying one."
2,Ok while it works,"Cheap printer, but even for a cheap one, it is quite poorly made. I jams paper practically non-stop, the printer refuses to accept paper, makes noises, runs slow, prints poor quality photos (when it works) and the ink is pricey. Spend more and get a better model. This is my second disappointment from an Epson printer."
1,Epson Stylus - Poor Construction,"Despite very good print performance and quality for the price range, this printer does not last. After less than 2 years of light but regular usage, one change of ink, and less than a single ream of paper, the print head failed. Epson's only answer - Buy another Epson! I don't think so."
1,Paper Jam,"I recently purchased the Epson Stylus C66 printer for my personal home use. However, the paper would not feed into the printer. It would pull to the left and jam in the feed repeatedly. I did get it to print a couple sheets but the paper had to positioned exactly to feed through straight. Needless to say, I returned the Epson because the paper jamming was making the printer useless. I have never been a big fan of the top loading printer and now I know why."
5,Nice book,The book was shipped quickly and packaged well.The price was right and I am glad I bought from this company.
2,Just the facts,"Dary reports in great detail the daily life of settlers heading west. He did a prodigious amount of research. However, the details are tedious and incorrect at times. I yearned for an insightful observation or at least a summary statement. He offered none."
4,"not perfect, but essential","I'm a scholarly specialist on the American west. My take on this work is that the flaws are balanced by some real strengths that make it essential to my personal library. Anyone grounded in western history will perceive the mis-steps, but will also appreciate the excellent set of maps, the selection of historical photographs, and flashes of illumination. And as another reviewer mentioned, there are also very useful appendices of historic landmarks and trail cut-offs. Dary assembled a very worthwhile overview of the first half of the overland trail era. The final chapter chronicles the afterlife/rebirth of the trail, as orchestrated by the amazing Ezra Meeker, the one-time ""Hop King of the World,"" who at age 77 embarked on a series of schooner trips to promote recognition of the Oregon Trail."
1,The Oregon Trail,"I have to say that this is one of the most boring history books I have read to date and I've read hundreds. I'm not aware of factual errors the other reviewers mention (as I'm not that familiar with this period in American history), but the book is so generally written with so many names and dates that it's almost as boring as the high school textbooks we all hated. Not quite that bad, but certainly not up to the standards I've come to expect from a History Book Club selection.I'm half finished with the book and though I really hate to give up on any book I start, I may not finish this one. I can't really recommend it."
2,Looked like a bad copy,I was disappointed in the color and clarity. It had snow through most of the DVD and the color was not as sharp as all the others I had of this collection. It would not hold my grandchilds attention or mine for that matter. It looked like a bad copy and the case was very sticky and torn. Did not return it because my time and trouble to send it back is not worth the dollars I spent on it.
5,Great Christmas Gift,"We loved the affordable prices and the variety of truly Biblical veggie tales available from this seller. This DVD includes some of our favorite Bible stories, and we know our son will love them."
5,Great Quality,"The Carhartt t-shirts are a much better quality than anything else I've found. They're generously sized (I ordered a size smaller than other brands) and my husband really likes the fact that they're a little longer so they'll stay tucked in - no ""plumber"" type issues!!"
5,Great work shirt!,"This shirt is well made and comfortable. They do run big! Even after washing in hot water (no discernible shrinkage). I'm 5'8"" 175lbs, the large hangs to mid thigh. I will definitely buy more, maybe I'll try a medium."
3,Confusing,"Ordered 4 shirts all XXL I got 3 relaxed fit, 1 regular fit. All 4 shirts fit different. Ended up returning 2 of them. I don't see where you can request relaxed or regular fit, so I guess they decide for you. Also I don't understand the fit difference with the 3 relaxed fit that I received, you would think they would all be the same. One even had shorter sleeves than the other 2, that one was like a mix between the regular and relaxed fit. I'm just glad amazon has a good return policy."
4,dont have time no time,dont hdont have time no timeave time no time vdont have time no time dont have time no time dont have time no time dont have time no timedont have time no timedont havedont dont have time no timehave time no time time no time
3,sizing,"Note, I would give 5 stars for shirt itself. This shirt, however, should be labelled big and tall. That, I would have understood as sizing different from normal. This x-large is way too big for my x-large."
1,not true Carhartt,"I sent back all these shirts. They were not true Carhartt! They were very thin chessy fabric, not like the real Carhartt shirts that are usually very thick & sturdy. My husband hated them."
1,Must have been a returned item.,I bought this in a size medium along with a long sleeve in size medium. The long sleeve fit fine but this one did not. The short sleeve was packaged differently and had been washed. I believe it had been dried on very high temperature which caused it to shrink. Returned for refund and luckily that did not reduce my order total below $25 or I would have been charged shipping on the total order.
3,Too big,"I purchased 2 Carhartt t-shirts previously, both Large size, and the sleeves and waist are so short that I never wear them. So this time I bought a few of the Large Tall size t-shirts and now it's the opposite problem. I feel like I'm wearing an XL or XXL shirt with a smaller neck hole. Actually most XXL shirts aren't as long as these. I really look funny with these shirts. I might try a Medium Tall size next but I'm afraid that will just be too slender. Maybe if you're 6'6"" or taller and thin, but not skinny, then the Large Tall size will fit well."
1,Way Over Sized!,I am a tall man. I am 6'5 and always buy clothes in a tall size. I purchased this shirt in a large tall. Well let me tell you that the shirt was about the size of a XXL and it went down to my knees! You want to talk about over sized?!!!!! I looked like I was a 3 year old boy wearing his daddy's t-shirt! The shirt itself is of good quality but I recommend buying this shirt 2 sizes smaller than you normally wear.
2,Not what they used to be,"I have been wearing Carhardt's pocket tee shirts for quite a few years now. Up until very recently they, like most of my Carhardt products, have been excellent products. These shirts are no longer made in the USA, but in Honduras, Mexico and assorted other countries. Where they are made isn't what bothers me about these shirts now but what really bothers me is when they outsourced the manufacture of these shirts they also have manufactured them from a thinner cotton material. Their thickness is what so many of us liked about these shirts. I will no longer buy these shirts due to the thinner material the are made out of currently. If enough of us boycott purchase of their current pocket T shirt perhaps Carhardt will get the message. MAKE THESE SHIRTS OUT OF THE SAME THICK COTTON MATERIAL THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MADE OUT OF. THAT'S WHY WE BOUGHT THEM. THEY WERE DURABLE WORK SHIRTS AT ONE TIME."
4,Great Tee Shirt for the money,"This is a great tee for the money, fabric is heavy and the shirt is well constructed. For me the shirt is a bit long, sizing seemed a bit smaller than I would prefer."
2,Quality not as good as once was,"I bought 4 of these Carhartt shirts and noticed that the quality is not as good as previously bought shirts. They are of a lighter material and the stitching not as good around the neck and shoulder areas.Not sure if I would buy these again, I don't think they will last very long. I would pay a little more if the quality was there."
1,"Carhart pocket tee,CHEAP QUALITY!!!","This is second shirt i've bought in the last couple of months,the first one came apart at the lower left seams after the first washing and under the arm and now today the second one came (5-4-12) and it has a 1 X 2 inch. black stain along the same side as the first one that is comming apart,i thought that paying 14 bucks for a tee shirt would be of some sort of quality but i quess not,is not worth the price,besides not many color choices in this size also,will not buy again.!!!!!!"
4,A classic that is still high quality--beware of sizing.,"I have 4 of these t-shirts, 2 henleys and 1 lightweight t-shirt. Love them all. They look great, wear well and are as comfortable as any shirt you will own. The quality of the shirt is much higher than the 4-7 dollar t-shirts you will get at Wally World....these cost more but will last for years even with regular use and washing.--Beware of sizing, as many have already said, they run bigger....I wear an XL in EVERY other shirt I have but for these I wear a large. I am 6 ft tall, 225 lbs with broad shoulders and a 46 inch chest.Overall I LOVE these shirts!"
5,well constructed,Finally a 3x tshirt for my husband that is not thin and cheap. This one is constructed properly with a big opening for his big head and neck!
5,gvreta shirts,these are the only shirts I wear. they hold up like iron and feel nice. great price here too. they do not shrink too much at all which helps choosing the correct size.
5,"Big, dumb, T-shirt","I love Carhartt T-shirts. They are oversized, usually with a longer tail to prevent ""Plumbers Crack"" for a man with a heavy belt on. They are very thick cotton, and will keep you warm in the cold, and reasonably protected from sparks. Just a good quality, sturdy shirt that will last a long time. I own many of them."
5,"Great, heavy-duty work shirt!","This shirt is perfect for working in! Very durable and comfortable fit. I ordered a medium and it seemed to be quite large for a medium at first, but after washing and tumble drying, the fit was a perfect Medium."
4,Nice shirts,I always liked Carhart items so I thought I would try their pocket T-shirts. The shirts fit well are are longer which is great for me. The fabric is a heavier fabric that has shrank very little. I would recommend them.
3,"quality yes, size no.",I ordered 2 xxl shirts and that is what ccame in the mail...but the shirts could of fit an xxxxl.
5,great product,Good quality heavy duty work shirt for my husband. He needs a pocket and this shirt is perfect for him.
5,Nice Heavy T Shirt,"Heavy T shirt well made, fits well and stands up to lots of wearing. Would recommend to anyone needing a good T shirt"
3,Carhartt T-shirts MADE IN HAITI,I work in construction and have always used Carhartt products because they were American made. These are the last shirts I'll buy from them . I did look at my USA map and I can't find which state Haiti is in.
5,Husband is very happy,My husband really likes these shirts. The size is right and they are nice heavey weight. He will be ordering more in the future.
3,Not the same.,"If you're familiar with the USA Carhartt T's from about 5 years back, these are not the same. The material is thinner on the newer version, and they fit slightly bigger. The colors also fade faster, and these wear faster. Still a good shirt, but disappointing if you are familiar with the older version of these t-shirts."
2,"thin material, cheap and , over sized","Carthartt constantly changes these t-shirts for the worse. They are thinner, unbelievbaly over-sized.I put no faith in these glowing reviews. I rememember the Carthartt t-shirts of 3-4 years ago. They were superb. Today, they are no better that five for ten dollars at K-Mart."
3,Lower quality than expected. There are better options.,"Once my Dickies shirts had prematurely worn out, I made the decision to switch to another brand. Carhartt was the first one to come to mind. They were a considerable investment for tshirts, but I have always felt that quality is worth the price.I was initially pleased with the thickness, fit and color selection of these t's. However, in just three months of wear the colors unevenly faded across the shirts and holes/wear marks started to show around the collar areas. The tan, red and gray shirts showed these flaws more than the navy, white and black shirts did.At 6 foot 2 inches and 225lbs, I wear an XL in other tshirts. This was not the case in Carhartt. They run big. I found that the L tall fit me perfectly.These tshirts did keep their shape and size characteristics after several washings, but based on the problems that I experienced and the hefty price tag, I can not recommend these to anyone."
5,Superior casual shirt,Gift to brother-in-law who wanted a good quality t-shirt with a front pocket.Looks like it will wear for a long time and look good.
4,"So far, so good.","So far I like this shirt. The main thing I was looking for was fit. I am 6'5"" and usually have a hard time finding a shirt that will stay tucked in. I do concrete construction and I wanted a shirt that is cool and durable. Carhartt has a name of being good quality. Only time will tell how it holds up, but so far I really like this shirt. The only thing I didn't like was the selection. This doesn't say the shirt is bad, it's just that in the XLT size there wasn't a good selection of colors. I'll check back and order more if there is a better selection of colors."
2,fair quality t-shirt,a pull thread on the logo patch pull and the patch comes off. very said for an expensive t-shirt. i will avoid purchasing this product again.
1,Do they pay me for Carhertt advertisement emblazened on my chest??,"Like all Carhartt wear, this is good quality. It's a very good, heavyweight, pocketed tee shirt with a crew neck; just what I wanted. Too bad they had to put their label on the front my shirt, ruins it for me, what am I a billboard for Carhartt?! Really, so obnoxious, it changed a great tee shirt I would most certainly buy into a product I wouldn't consider buying."
5,Excellent,"Shirts I purchased are true to size and very substantial. Minimal shrinkage and fabric doesn't bleed when washed. The only 2 possible problems are the neck could be a little tight for some (but better than a saggy, stretched-out fit) and they are heavyweight cotton, so in hot summer might get a liitle warm.I recommend this product highly."
5,Great customer service,I must say the product and price is great but the customer service is above and beyond what I expected
5,Great T-shirt!,I am very picky about t-shirt material. I hate thin material. It has been hard to find good quality in tall sizes. You won't be disappointed in these shirts.
3,Definitely Didn't Sound Like Home To Me,"What can I say except that I expected more from Monifah than what was on this cd. She has a wonderful voice and always showcases her talent on duets and guest appearances, however on the solo tip she was disappointing. Her single ""I Can Tell"" is the best song on the CD. The CD is full of old, traditional, Teddy Riley beats. We know her for being somewhat explicit, but on a CD entitled HOME and a picture of her daughter in the cover you don't expect to have those ""sex-songs"" on this album. I was wrong; Peaches & Cream and NANA are songs I wonder if she let her family here. Well Monifah, maybe next time!"
4,A big improvement for me in ripping hardwoods,"I have been remodeling our kitchen and have been fortunate to find a local sawmill that has some white oak that has 6 years of covered air drying. This is hard stock and my other blades left lots of burns and saw marks in the ripping process. This Freud blade has reduced that by about 90% thus easing the finishing prep hand planing or sanding and sealing. As long as your saw is all squared up, this blade should do the trick in getting the rip and tenon cuts you want with a minimum of after cut work. WJP"
4,A Blade for A Low Horse Saw,"I've been using CMT blades for three years, and the one I use most is 40 tooth general blade with 1/8 kerf. It's done great jobs for me so far. But when it comes to cutting heavy stock such as 8/4 red oak or hard maple, my saw 'll definitely come to a halt. And by the way my saw is obviously a portable low horse. So I thought it's time for me to get upgraded. After reviewing bunch of saws and blades, I came across Freud's ads The Utimate Thin Kerf Rip Blade. I was just thinking perhaps I should give it a try. And the result was I didn't have to replace the saw. this blade can really go against anything I feed through. It produces nice and clean cuts as well as vibration reduction. Besides, jointing is unnecessary after the cut. The only reason why I should give this blade four stars is that mine came with a few factory defected carbide teeth. However, I 'd recommend this blade to anyone who own an under powered saw."
5,This aint your granddaddy's rip blade,"This blade goes beyond cutting and surgically removes wood with ease. The lazer cut dampers vertually eliminate vibration and noise. Thump it with your finger and all you hear is a dull thunk. The aggresive hook angle, thin kerf and low run out make for smooth cuts (for 24 teeth) and very low feed effort. Use this in my 3HP cabinet saw for ripping and mortise cheek cuts in softer wooods and can hardly tell your cutting anything. The finish cut is comparable to a combo blade. Definately the blade for a low powered saw. Dont know about durability yet as I only have a few hours on it."
5,Excellent product,"Freud never lets me down been using these blades for twenty years. I running this on a Bosch 10"" table saw ripping mostly 2x and 1x lumber with no problems at all. Highly recommend this blade."
5,"Frued 24"" Tooth saw blade",This was a gift for my husband and he was very pleased. Well known brand that met his expectations.
5,About As Good as a 24 Tooth Rip Blade Gets,"Performance of the Freud LU87R010 is about as good as you can reasonably get from a 10"" thin kerf 24 tooth bulk ripping blade. It has a flat top grind (FTG) that efficiently removes stock, and a steep positive hook angle to reduce resistance when feeding wood into the saw. It'll rip efficiently to ~ 3"" on most common 110v saws (< 2hp) , and leaves a glue ready edge with minimal saw marks. It's not recommended as a crosscut blade, but does a very respectable job of it's intended task. I've also used the Freud LM72, DeWalt 7124TK, Leitz 24T ripper, and Infinity 24T ripper. IMHO, the LU87 is as good as any bulk ripper."
4,"Paul Burch ""Blue notes""",I purchased the CD because one of Paul Burch's song was on the Oxford American Southern Music edition. This CD truely reflects some of the southern influences identified in the articles accompanying the Oxford American CD. I thought it was an excellant example of his body of work.
5,LOVE this music,"I recently 'found' this music inadvertenly while doing other research, and boy do I love it. I listened to some clips on [...], then came directly to Amazon to find Paul's cd's. I started with Blue Notes because I especially like the songs on it, it is great music. I hope to find other cd's of his and add to my collection. He is definitely a new favorite of mine!! I read an interview with him and he does not label himself 'country' so I hate to use that word, but some of the songs are country-ish. But not today's ""country"", more like the country music of the 50's and 60's ... the really authentic, great stuff. LOVE it."
3,great CD- bad packaging,the cd is great but the case arrived all smashed. needs better packaging. thanks M
5,Best Bang-For-The-Buck,"I originally chose GPO years ago because I wanted to dabble in orchestral instrumentation. However, I was not a professional, so paying a high dollar for good samples was not a practical consideration. After using it, I was able to get professional results, so the price was a bit deceiving. It was far more than what I thought I was paying forI work on a Macintosh using GarageBand, and GPO has far more articulation and nuance control over JamPack 4. it is absolutely a joy to have an entire orchestra as close as my own keyboard. I use it to help my kids hear what different instruments sound like and to listen for them in Classical music. Listen to the numerous examples and hear for yourself!"
1,Poorly Disguised Political Views Masquerading as Research,"This book does NOTHING to advance the cause of public health. It is a direct attack against the private ownership of firearms.The author and others of his ilk will do anything to avoid attributing the social cost of street violence to the destruction of the family which has been largely caused by 50 years of liberal public policies. If they can also disarm the law-abiding citizens at the same time, then their leftist agenda is furthered even more.Pure drivel!"
1,alll lies,"this is the usual drivel to seep from the anti-gun crowd. this author wants nothing more than to take the law abiding citizens right to keep and bear arms away and turn us all into subjects instead of citizens. i only bought this book to see what the anti-gun crowd is trying to pull now. i'm either going to use this book for toilet paper or to start fires in my fire place since that's all it's good for. i personally recommend john lott's ""more guns=less crime"" for a factual piece about guns and gun control."

4,Lots of inspiration and soul,"A great album by Ray. Packed with some great soul and gospel tinged backing vocals...although a little repetitive at times in the choruses...nevertheless, it's a real good album and worth owning. Eric Clapton provides the guitar on ""None of us are free"" and has a terrific solo part on it. The covers of ""A Song for You"" and ""Still crazy after all these years"" are better than the originals. Anyone who enjoys Ray Charles' music will love this album. Recommended."
3,Something For The Fans,"By '93, there was no new ground to break for Ray Charles - his genius had already worked its wonder in many areas of music. This album is something to make his fans smile as they kick back in their recliner and watch nature shows on Cable while their dinner cooks in the microwave. There are only two tracks on the CD which could conceivably be placed on a ""Best Of"" kind of collection - Elton John's ""A Song For You"" and Paul Simon's ""Still Crazy After All These Years"", both slow tempo. I think he should have performed the Simon tune in his ""Hallelujah, I Love Her So"" tempo, but, hey, it's okay. It appears that Ray plays piano on only one track - considering the heavily commercial sound on *all* the tracks, maybe it was a good choice."
2,Really disappointed...,"I was hoping these would have the higher output LED's in them so they stood out and were bright, but they don't. They basically flash three separate LED's one at a time which makes it pretty dim. If they flashed all three at one time, it'd probably be much brighter.Overall, not worth the money IMO.Also, I believe it says they take C batteries, but the ones I received took AAA batteries. ????"
5,Entrancing,"Wonderfully hipnotic, this compilation of world inspired tunes is a veritable compendium of all that is great. Claude Challe has done his homework here, grabbing what must be the creme de la creme of international artists, fusing their flawless masterpieces together, to create a tireless album, of endless listening pleasure. If you are an aficionado of modern world music, then Buddha Bar 2 will most definitely take pride of place in your collection. This is an album truely worth the investment."
4,buddhastic,"Ideal album for lazy-lying in your sofa, drinking a gin and tonic and dreaming away to buddha's paradise. Fantastic music!"
1,Overindulgent Crap,"Awful. People say this is THE album for the ""lower-West-Side-trendy-martini-party"" but it is NOT!! If you play this at your party people will leave. I also find it disgusting and offensive that they use the Buddha as a marketing tool to sell this compilation of drabby garbage that isn't worthy of being played at a yoga session for autistic chimpanzees. Too bad 1 is the least amount of stars I can give."
5,uh-huh,"i don't care wht you think, but I play track 5 thru 7 over and over. and i can't stop. these may be the 3 most beautiful songs put together that i've ever heard. okay so maybe i don't get out much but if you're looking for uplifting music you can maybe dance to check out these 3 songs and you'll know what i experienced."
5,Puts You In A Great Mood,"I bought this CD on a whim, and was blown away when I started to listen to it. I'm addicted, pushing play again every time I reach the end, removing one CD only to replace it with the other.The sound is exotic, sophisticated and positive, and whether I'm actively or passively listening to it, it transports me to a great mental space. It's funky and spiritual at the same time.I can't wait to visit the restaurant! I'll have to book a flight to Paris."
2,over-hyped,"There are a few good tracks on each disc. But this 2 disc set is DEFINATELY not worth the 40-something dollars I paid for it.The track with Deepak Chopra featuring Demi Moore? Ugh,ick! It belongs on a self help recording,not at your house party.Don't believe the hype y'all."
5,want to fly??????????,"Hello world! Want to fly, without being in a plane? Listen to Claude Challe's Buddha Bar II. You will move, fly and be swept away with this mix of tunes. Buy it, let your friends listen to it. They will buy it, too. Relax, Buddha Bar II is your medicine. Go Claude, Go.............."
1,Price !,"If you spend the outrageous price on any of these compilations then you really have too much money.My suggestion is that you look at buying the ""K&D sessions"" by Kruder & Dorfmeister or any of the compilations titled ""Buddha Beats"", ""Karma Beats"" or ""KrisnaBeats"". Even the Cafe Del Mar compilations are better value.Sure the Buddha Bar in Paris is great but it is nothing unique, special or worthy of this price for 2 CDs ! Can someone please explain why we need to pay this priceto someone who probably thinks more about being a yuppie than a hippy ?With the money you save donate it to Amnesty or any free Tibet organization."
3,Good idea for a single,"Manowar quickly followed their 2002 opus Warriors of the World with this single, which features two brand new tracks. The Dawn of Battle is a fast stormer in the style of ""Fight until we die"" and ""I Believe"" is a very heavy doomy ballad. Is it worth the dough to buy this (sorta) ep as well? One can download it all! ...but also this cd is full of extras, including teasers for their upcoming dvds. That said, the two new songs are not as fresh sounding as the ones on the full length, and one might be dissapointed in the cliched lyrical choices in the new tracks. Buy only if you're a hardcore fan."
2,Carbide teeth chip very easily!!,"I bought this blade to rip white oak and it cut very well at first. After a couple hundred feet it slowed down so I took it to my sharpener and he couldn't sharpen it because of all the chipped teeth!! None of the teeth were missing, but al of them had chunks of carbide broken out. Not very impressed....."
5,use for lap makint tennons and other joints,"The sole purpous of this blade for me is when cutting joints on the TS. It has flat square teeth so I get a flat bottom on my joints, ie Tenon sides, lap joints...."
2,pretty but completely pornographic,The art work is nice and if you were going to be doing a reading for an adult party or someone whose questions were about sex these are perfect. Otherwise though they are very graphic and not good for normal readings.
2,Tarot of Casanova,"This deck is ""OK"" but not worth the price. I think there are much better decks out there, for much less $. Although the images are lovely, I found it difficult to find the correlation between some of the images and their meaning."
5,Magnate 7204 45 Corner Lock Mitre Router Bit review,"Great router bit. I only have a 2 Peak HP 100 dollar sears bench router and this 1/4"" shank bit plows through 3/4"" boards with ease.Magnate also sent their catolog and shipping was only 3 days. Very satisfied customer, will buy more of their products."
3,tlc rejected this can you believe this,mary j blige is okay singing this mug and ja can't sing at all but I love hearing him try.
4,Good introduction to a new world,"I am not an avid follower of Mage Knight. I am more acquainted with the MechWarrior Universe, but I thought I'd give Mage Knight a go. I enjoyed this novel. As a newcomer to this universe, I found that Bill McCay did a good job in explaining about the Atlantean Empire and the Rebels who were fighting against them. The incorporation of various races such as dwarves and orcs added to the fantasy in the novel. The story is good, if predictable. The Rebels, developing a new weapon known as gunpowder, have worried the Atlantean elites. Guardsman Blaize is charged by the Empire to find and root out the Rebels. Along the way, he must question his commitment to the Empire as he sees the policies that his Empire enacts against others. While the story does follow a typical adventure novel, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I recommend it along with WizKids other game universes."
2,Thunder with no BOOM,"Rebel Thunder, the first in a series of books based on the Mage Knight Role Playing game follows the Atlantean spy Blaize on his mission to infiltrate the Black Powder Rebels. The rebels seek to free the oppressed souls enslaved by the empire built by evil mage Karrudan. While working amongst the rebels Blaize discovers they have invented a new and devastating weapon...Gun Powder.Blaize must come to terms with his growing love for the rebel Rikka and his disillusionment for the Empire and the time is fast approaching when he must take sides. Rebel Thunder is an interesting mix of magic and technology; unfortunately the story left me feeling a bit empty and could have used more fleshing out. The characters are fairly good but you can't really delve too far into them, which is disappointing."
4,Tornados: Storm or no Storm,"The Austin City Limits session is my favourite burst from these guys, and that extra star is reserved for that performance. Songs just a tad more appealing, particularly Freddy Fender's weepies. It's essentially the same diet, though. Bright, breezy and as big as the western skies; a far cry from my only live performance of the late, great Sir Doug at the Bottom Line in 1978, when darker atmospherics prevailed.(and Kinky Friedman and cigar were the main act!) Flaco Jiminez's accordion is essential to the Tornado's sonics and he's got plenty of room here to stretch out."
4,Tex-Mex to eat tacos by,I'm not a great lover of country-western music but the Texas Tornado's style of Tex-Mex music takes me back to my days in El Paso and some of the seedier dives in Juarez. Yeeee-hah!!!
3,not quite it,Not quite as comprehensive as it could have been/ walking till daybreak was much more informative There was not one but many different waves of peoples swept up together
5,A Book That Everyone Should Have!,"The Snowy Day, a Caldecott winner, is a wonderful book about a liitle boy who enjoys a day in the snow. Keats has great illustrations that make the book so wonderful. Everyone should have a copy of this book."
5,Inspiring illustrations,"I am a graphic designer inspired by this simple, beautiful book. The illustrations are truly special."
3,The Snowy Day,This book was about a boy who wakes up one day and looks outside and sees that it had snowed. He gets so excited and asks his mom to go out and play. He wonders out into the snowy new world. He makes snow angels and tries to play with the big boys in the snow fight. He realizes that he isn't old enough yet. So he goes home and goes to bed. That night he has a dream that the sun had come out and the snow had melted away. When he woke up he goes to the window and sees that the snow is still there he goes and gets his neighbor and they travel out into the snow once again.This book is an easy reader for children just learning to read.
2,The Snowy Day,The Snowy Day is a great book for kids of the age 4-6 years old.The book is about a little boy who has a great time out side. He plays in the snow making snow angles and snowmen and many more great things. He try's to have fun with older kids but he seemed to not fit in.He soon learns that not all things are here to stay.The book is not one of the best books out there but the pictures are pretty.
1,The Snowy Day by Tommy Puckett,"My book reveiw is on the book ""The Snowy Day"", by Ezra Jack Keats. The book is about a little boy named Peter, who liked to go out and play in the snow. Peter made a smiling snowman, and angels in the snow. He tried to save snowballs in his pocket for the next day. He had a dream that the sun came out and melted all the snow, but when he woke up it was still snowy outside. I did not like this book because it was boring."
4,The Snowy DAy,"The book reminds me of what I used to do in the snow, make foot prints. Moreover, I understand how Peter feels when he wakes up and sees the snow outside. For instance, I remember the snow being taller than me when I rode the bus to school, just like the pictures in the story. Also, I started playing with Peter, making a snowman and knocking snow off the branches of trees, as I read the book. More importantly, if your child has never made angles in the snow or engaged in a snow ball fight, let her go out and play- read them The Snowy Day."
5,Timeless classic for pre-schoolers.,"The reader follows the activity of a small boy from wake-up to out-of-doors play and back to bath and bed.The mystery of the missing snowball adds gentle humor.Children delight in the details and enjoy acting out the adventure in pantomine. It happens that the child is not Caucasian, but race is not important to the story, just as it should be! Winner of the Caldecott award for outstanding illustration in 1963 and still fresh."
4,One of the classics of picture books,"We all remember the joy of a snowy day as a child, before you had to shovel, right?Making footprints in the snow. Making snowmen, snow angels, snowballs. Discovering that snow melts if you put it in your pocket for later when you come in the house.This book doesn't attempt to tell a story with problems to solve, villains, or much of a plot. Instead, it just follows Peter through his day exploring his world and being a child. Beautiful, sweet - every library needs this book."
5,"fun book, good read for any age",my daughter loves this book. Fun to read at any age and helps you appreciate the snow.
5,Wonderful classic kids' book,"This book is a classic from the 1960's, and a winner of the Caldecott Medal. I've always loved it, and now I can pass it on to my young nephew. It follows the activities of a young boy during perhaps his first snowfall. The illustrations are unique, and it's a great read-to or read-with book for young children and those just learning how to read. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good book with lots of pictures for kids from 2 to 5/6 years old. It's also a great way to introduce snow to kids who live in parts of the country/world where snow doesn't often or never falls. Enjoy!"
5,Our boy loves the book,Our 2.5-year-old loves this book and asks to read it frequently. We live in Idaho and we get significant snow most years so he enjoys seeing the book and looking outside to see the real snow too. This book is a winner.
4,A Cute Book,"Thoughts:* I loved this book as child! Who doesn't like a snow day!* I knew this book was a paperback but I didn't know it would be so flimsy, so that made me a little sad.* I bought it as a gift for a friend's 2 year old, she may be a little young for it but in a year or two it will be perfect. She can still look at the pictures!A lovely read, at a great price. It's a paperback though, just FYI!"
5,"Gentle, sweet. A love story about snow and a boy.","This simple story, and the lovely, original illustrations capture the ethereal beauty of a child enjoying all the quiet magic of snowy day. Peter spends his snowy day exploring things fun and curious about snow--making funny footprints, sledding, hitting a tree to make the snow fall from its branches, up to and including a warm bath. Even the mundane is depicted with sensory detail--as a child would perceive it. He saves a snowball in his pocket, but sadly, can't figure out where it went at the end of the day. Of course the happy ending is that he awakes to find freshly fallen snow. We started reading this when my son was three, and still read it as he approaches six years."
5,A classic for a reason,"Previous reviewers have said it: clear, recognizable, simple, colourful, engaging, delightful.Perhaps it is anachronistic that Peter is sent out to play in a city by himself all day, and that he calls on ""his friend from across the hall"" in person rather than by SMS, but perhaps it shouldn't be. This book shows a young boy being capable and happy in his environment, not isolated by urbanism or fear of the elements.And besides, this is how a child would remember such a day whether the details are the same as the story or not.Pair it with ""Rain Feet"" for 2 out of 4 books in a 'weather' series (send me a comment if you have a recommendation for the other 2!) with the added bonus that both depict black characters without any reference to race at all."
2,Buggy implementation of a classic,"I was looking forward to this based on my memories of the arcade version. I wish I'd waited until the reviews showed up.The first challenge - works as expected. If you die, you go back to the start of the game. After that, it throws you into a random sequence if you die, making it nearly impossible to complete anything, because you only get one try. If you're patient, it'll eventually start behaving properly again, and you can actually play it as a game.The default setup is also poor; you need to turn on indicators to actually be able to play it.As a piece of history, it's interesting. As a game, it doesn't have a lot to offer."
1,Buggy and Un-usable,"The game I received was so buggy it was unusable. I will return it or throw it away. It is hard to say what is good about the game when it simply won't work properly. The game did not respond reliably to input, it frequently hung, and basically acted as though it was horribly scratched or something (but it was not scratched -- it was fresh out of the box with no handling whatsoever). Maybe mine was faulty, but from reading the other reviews, it seems like this disc just isn't ready for prime time. It appears to be a faulty product and should be recalled."
2,Slow Response,This game is not how I remember it from my childhood. I guess things have changed. The game was slow and uneventful.
2,Great game but unplayable on the PS3,"One of my all time favorites, but completely unplayable on my PS3. It hangs... I mean forever at specific boards. Disc completely new and untouched.Another question is: WHY IS THERE NO SUPPORT FOR THE BLU-RAY for DRAGON'S LAIR & SPACE ACE on DIGITAL LEISURE'S SITE?Is it because they knew there are way too many glitches?"
1,This game was not as fun as I thought it would be!,This game is bad. The picture delay for this game is incredibly difficult to deal with. For the PS2 format maybe but for PS3 no way!
1,A beautiful travesty,"This game looks spectacular, but it is a game, and when a game doesn't play they way it should, it is a waste. The watch mode allows you to enjoy the lovely animation, but I wanted to play Dragon's Lair. Sadly, even with the latest PS3 firmware, playing the game is a joke. Glitch after glitch, and the scenes randomly jumping from one to the next if you make a wrong move, make this a sad experience. This is nothing like how the arcade game plays. I love Dragon's Lair in the arcade, on the Atari Jaguar CD or on the PC, but this blu-ray version is just terrible. Digital Leisure should be ashamed for releasing such buggy garbage."
3,Listed incorrectly,"This is listed as a PS3 title - that is absolutely wrong. It is a Blu-ray product and can be played on your stand-alone Blu-ray player. This means it can ALSO be played on the PS3 as well, since it's a Blu-ray player.AMAZON FIX THIS!!!(I picked middle values for the ratings because I have never touched this product but had to rate it to post the review)"
1,not good on ps3 blue ray...,Will not play on ps3 blueray player. I don't know if any one wrote a review on that fact. I don't think I saw one when I went to buy it. do not buy!!!!!!!!!!! you've been warned!
1,Not Compatible With PS3,"When it works, this game looks wonderful. However, it simply does not work on a PS3. I don't know what the performance is like on other blu-ray devices, but if you have a PS3, do not buy this product."
4,"good game, could use some improvement","fun game, but could get some improvement.the worst is when you hit menu button and it resest all your progress since it is just an interactive movie. also, the repetiveness of some of scenes gets a little hard to take in the end. some death scenes are too short. but, if you want to skip it should help. i guess options are limited in this format. overall, it is a novel game and a lot of fun if you master it."
3,"Perfect,exept for long random pauses between episodes.","This game was great,exactly like the arcade game and looked tremendous on blu-ray.My promlem is with the long random pauses between episodes(Sometimes 10 minutes or more!)Very annoying.Maybe it is just my player(Samsung, 2010) Except for this one flaw the game is perfect.Looking forward to Space Ace."
5,heater calhoun 2k,"Pizzo flow has such creativity whatever beat he does i bought this album back in 2001 let me tell you in my opinion, the production is dope also he hooked up wit killa tay B legit, NoFace, E-40 and Laroo"
4,LITTLE VILLAGE,"I hadn't listened TO Hiatt's BRING THE FAMILY or LITTLE VILLAGE in a while, so in the past days I re-aquainted myself with these great albums.It seems LITTLE VILLAGE gets short shrift, compared to BRING THE FAMILY and while, yes, BRING THE FAMILY is my favorite of the two due to Hiatt's songwriting, this album has soul and passion all over it. As my wise, late father-in-law used to say (about anything), ""Now that's REAL!"" This music is REAL and Cooder, Hiatt, Keltner and Lowe deserve our praise for bringing it to us."
2,"It Pains Me To Say It, But","At first listen, this album sounds bland and uninspired, but after repeated listens it proves to be downright annoying, which is a shame, since I think highly of John Hiatt and especially Nick Lowe. But you know, supergroups will be supergroups, which means they will inevitably suck. Especially annoying are `Don't Think About Her When You're Trying To Drive' (I hated typing that even more than you hated reading it) and `Don't Bug Me When I'm Working' (are songs with really long titles ALWAYS bad? You decide). Fans of Lowe will dislike this album, as will fans of Hiatt, I can't say for sure about Cooder, I don't like him."
2,Not a good idea...,"As others have commented, teaming up the musicians responsible for John Hiatt's 1987 masterpiece, ""Bring the Family"" must have seemed like a good idea, but it wasn't.The difference is that this time the others get to write and sing. Seems pretty obvious to me that it wouldn't work; ""Bring the Family"" is so good because it's a JOHN HIATT album.This album doesn't even work when the song is obviously Hiatt penned, because he's trying to be Little Village, not John Hiatt. I don't think a single song on here is memorable, except for its dullness. When Hiatt is singing, it's just about worth the effort of putting it in the player, but otherwise... not a good idea."
5,No More Deodorant,"I have used Hibiclens for almost 20 years as a body wash, and have not used deodorant at all since then. I have no body odor and no side effects (dry skin or skin reaction), and highly recommend this product. No one believes how effective it is, but then again, they do not understand that body odor is caused by bacteria on the skin, and since Hibiclens is highly effective at killing those bacteria, the cause of body odor is gone!"
3,The per oz price is incorrect,"At $59.52 per gallon (128 oz), the per ounce price is 46.5 cents, not 29 or whatever it says (the image goes away when you enter a review)."
4,Fun trip down memory lane,"Jerry Reed is an amazing guitarist, and his early 70's recordings combine his country and pop instincts with a great sense of humor and humility.I had not heard most of these songs for nearly 30 years, so my opinions of the material are based on my nostalgic fondness for them. Even so, there's a lot to like here. Particular favorites are ""500 Miles Away From Home"" (great guitar work!), ""Alabama Wild Man"" and ""Huggin' and Chalkin'"".The songs run the gamut from country and pop ballads to country funk rave-ups. The sound quality is excellent, which is surprizing considering the age of this little known material. One Way Records continues to mine gems from the past that the major labels missed."
2,Not really what I expected.,"There are a couple pros to this easel. 1- The easel is stable. 2- It is one of the few easels I have found that is truley double sided, meaning I can hang two pieces of canvas on them and my children can use it in tandem. Most of the easels I have found that claim to be dual sided are really just one drawing side and one dry erase/chalk side. Past that, I can't really find anything nice to say.First off- this is NOT worth the money I spent on it. For what I spent I highly expected something of much better quality. Instead, I got some slabs of wood and bolts. The storage bins are cardboard and you have to fold them together yourself. They will not last past the first use and I'll have to go through the trouble of making my own. To top it off, for the size, the actual work space is small. They could have made it bigger and given the kids more room to create.I would suggest this only as a last resort."
4,MUST HAVE!!!!!,"Stephen Crane was such and eloquent poet. His works always seem to question both himself and society at large. ""War is Kind"" is the picture of this as Crane mocks the idea of glory in war, using sarcasm to condemn war even as he praises it. This is a wonderful book, one that everyone should at least read if they don't own it, but this is such a great price, it should be a must-have for every literary scholar."
5,Deep and Rich Coming of Age in America Story,"My parents bought me this book when I was in 4th grade. The previous review gives the details, but Weldon Hill captured a time and a group of characters to the point that this remains my favorite to this day. I read the cover and first couple of pages off of my copy, and I waited desperately for the ""Soon to be a Major"" Motion Picture advertised on the back cover, but it never materialized. Perhaps because they chose the title ""On The Road"" for the film, and this was the late 60's. This is the most richly developed coming of age story I have read. Any 10 year old boy who doesn't fall in love with Dixie Funkhauser, isn't actually breathing."
3,??????????????????,"it is worth watching ,but I`d never pay $26.00 for it ! very strange, disconected film . like a bad acid trip . it has its moments , and of course tina aumont is absolutely beautiful ! would I recommend it ? only if you can get it cheap , and if you like them weird !"
3,Happy Go Lovely DVD,"This is a review of the Alpha Video Distributors, Inc. DVD; the transfer is not very good. After the first couple of scenes it seems to improve a little but overall; it is only fair quality. I can enjoy the music, but without subtitles, I miss a lot of the dialogue; this copy doesn't have subtitles. The movie of course is great if you like David Niven and Vera Ellen; it has some great Vera Ellen numbers in it."
3,"Excellent movie, terrible DVD","Happy Go Lovely is a delightful romantic comedy. David Niven is his usual suave and charming self. The chemistry between him and Vera-Ellen is warm and genuine. She also demonstrates her terrific talents in a number of dancing scenes. All worth nothing less than 5 stars.Unfortunately the DVD transfer (by Alpha Video) is horrid. The video is coarse and grainy, the colors are washed out and often entirely wrong (but the audio is OK.) I give 1 star to the quality of the DVD.The 3 stars of my vote are intended as an overall average between the 1 and 5 stars noted above."
3,Not quite Happy go Lovely,"I love Vera Ellen and enjoy David Niven, and to be honest they carry this film. Apart from them the acting and dancing is poor to average. The picture and sound quality on the (c) GMVS Entertainment copy that I have is bad, comparable to a VHS LP recording. Having said that once I got used to the 10 year old picture quality I quite enjoyed the two stars performances"
5,"Fun light 50's movie, with incredibly perfect dancing by Vera-Ellen","I've always enjoyed watching others such as Ann Miller dance, but the dancing by Vera-Ellen in this movie was truly remarkable. She had total control over her slightest motion, appearing effortlessly natural through long and difficult routines. The movie was delightful. I originally bought this movie because I am a fan of Gordon Jackson, who had a brief support role in it. Vera-Ellen wasn't anyone I have previously enjoyed watching, so her skillful dancing and ""natural"" acting took me totally by surprise, VERY pleasantly."
3,Better than you would think,"The quality on this DVD is pretty poor, but it is watchable. As a musical the numbers are less than spectacular and they seem mostly plugged into the story. It is however a pretty good comedy and David Niven gives a nice performance as B.G. Bruno, the millionaire smitten with a chorus girl. Vera Ellen is okay as the lead and dances very well as usual, but her partners and the score are only okay. If you watch the movie purely as a comedy you will end up enjoying it though and the price is cheap."
3,Fun move/Great Vera Ellen however...,"Terribel DVD recording, bad sound, bad contrast. Obviously copied from a print and not a negative...too bad. Cheaply done and not at all sharp. If you can stand that, get it for the performances."
5,such a suprise,"I have searched and waited for this great movie since seeing it on PAX. Once I checked amazon my search was successful. This movie was creative; not the same old plot, as many are today. I enjoyed the predicament that came from a rumor that was not denied. And how Vera Ellen reaped benifits from this rumor. Please veiw and confirm my excitement."
3,A sweet and charming surprise. Three stars for three stars,"Having been spoiled by some of the Hollywood musicals, I found some of the musical numbers a bit lacking. But the presence of David Niven, Caesar Romero and Vera-Ellen overcame any lack. I think it's a sweet, charming surprise and enjoy it every time I view it. It's fun!"
5,The jigs and Little Musgrave alone make this a great album,Set your CD player to play tracks 2 and 8 and you'll go from the euphoria of the jigs to the bone chilling uilleann pipes of Liam O' Flynn on Little Musgrave and the heart wrenching story in that ballad.You could get this album for these two tracks alone and it would be money well spent.
5,Best I've ever used,"I've been an amateur woodworker for 25 years and in the last 5 or 6 years gotten into more and more projects that require the ""right tools"". I bought this blade 4 years ago when it first went on sale in our local area and I love it! Cuts whatever I feed into it with no difficulty and leaves a glass smooth edge. A little pricy in my local area to sharpen but that's life.At this point all my blades are Freud and I'm a cheap SOB at heart so that's saying a lot.Jim - a frugal New England woodworker"
4,I like this blade,"Never purchased what I could call a top-of-the-line blade for my 2.5HP Craftsman 10"" table saw until this one. I crosscut 3/4"" red oak and was so impressed with the smooth wood surface. Hardly any bog down, not to mention the low volume of saw dust produced. The thin kerf and teflon coating must be adding to this affect.This is the best blade I have ever owned, but since this is my first professional blade, I can't give it a 5 star rating, although it could very well be that. Very pleased!"
5,best saw blade ever,"smoothest cut ever on oak burl, like glass. no vibration,absolutely no complaints, all my Freud blades are well above ordinary"
5,great quality,"this ring I bought for my fiancee as a committment to our relationship, and along with my ring both came in beautiful navy blue ring boxes and both polised to glistten like stars. I searched for about 4 months to find the right ring, and it was just as the picture described. The miligrain detailing adds an edge of uniqueness and I could not be happier with the product. Thanks to Amazon."
4,"Good overall, but light on the Southern Outer Banks","Although a good overview of the historical shaping of North Carolina, I was especially thrown by the lack of attention given to the Southern Outer Banks. It would seem that Avon, Buxton and Hatteras are so unimportant that they don't even need a map in this work.The text on these towns is also fairly short, a glaring omission in a book that points out (with text and maps) various attractions along Hwy 12 along with milestone markers for the Northern Banks."
2,"One of my fave groups, but not this album","Cameo strong from the beginning and funk for the '70s and '80s...they are the bomb act, but this album's sound was bombed out."
3,Front Nut Getting in the way of my cable connector.,"I guess it depends on the type of front brake connector you have, but the front nut on this is getting in the way of my cable connection. Had to bend it forward a little bit in my vise to get it to work."
3,Bolt too short,"I ordered this for a steel touring bike frame that I'm building up to use as a commuter bike. The part is nicely finished and looks pretty sturdy, but the mounting bolt it came with turned out to be too short. I found a longer bolt at my local big-box hardware store but the bolt head doesn't fit into the cavity at the front of the bracket. I supposed I could file it down but this is getting to be too much of a hassle. I'll probably go with a traditional hanger off the steerer tube instead."
4,Sorry I waited on this one..,"After going through SERIOUS Soundgarden withdrawal, I had to finally pick this one up...I was not expecting much with this being a first release (an an EP, at that). BOY WAS I SURPRIZED ! The energy from LOUDER THAN LOVE and BADMOTORFINGER was always here ! You can hear the rawness and punk influence that Soundgarden began with, but it still leaves you wanting to hear more !HUNTED DOWN, ENTERING, TEARS TO FORGET are all hard rockers. NOTHING TO SAY is classic Soundgarden stuff with its heavy riffs... SWALLOW MY PRIDE is 70s-type of rock...WOW ! GOOD STUFF !IF ANYTHING, check out Chris Cornell actully RAPPING in the humorous LITTLE JOE...Yes, I said RAPPING !Soundgarden does it all...and does it all well. NOW what am I gonna do ? Wait for another solo project from Chris, I suppose."
2,One keeper,"This is the birth of my favorite grunge band, but I'd have to say that the only song worth hearing more than once here is ""Nothing to Say."" The others are attempts at sending up the whole heavy-metal genre's cliches, but they aren't too great. Strange how Soundgarden went from this to the layered darkness of its later recordings, though we would still get the occasional blasts of ironic humor."
3,A BEGINNING,"there is a reason early soundgarden is, well early soundgarden. the material is weak. the production is raw and gritty while the band is just starting to blossom. there is one song on here called nothing to say. i would put it up against any soundgarden song. it is brilliant. it is so heavy and yet not as distorted or well produced as later efforts. it is amazing. if it were not for this song. this album would have a two star rating from me.i find this album is quite diverse from punk (entering & tears to forget) to grooving distortion (of hunted down) and shows the blueprint of later soundgarden. worth it if your a fan of soundgarden or looking for a great band and the begginings of."
5,Classic Sub-Pop,Although Soundgarden isn't truely grunge (See Melvins). This album is Soundgarden at its rawest. Don't get me wrong. This is a classic and its Soundgarden at its best. No clean studio mixes like the rest of the major label stuff they made later. Also did you notice Chris Cornell sounds a lot like Ronnie James Dio. This also includes the FOPP EP. FOPP being an old Ohio Players tune. Kinda goofy.
1,crap.,This is not a good release compared to any other Soundgarden release which are just ok anyway.
4,Great album to show the grunge scene.,"I love Soundgarden! Screaming Live/Fopp is a good album (2 EPs put into one) to show Soundgarden's early roots and the grunge scene's early roots. 'Hunted Down,' 'Nothing To Say,' and 'Fopp' are my favorite tracks on this album."
3,For those who have the other albums...,"Perhaps not the ideal release for those who are yet uninitiated with Soundgarden, in my opinion the best band to emerge from the Seattle crucible in the late 80s/early 90s, but nonetheless a worthwhile purchase given the price. Seemingly against the grain of opinion from earlier reviews, I prefer the Fopp EP over Screaming Life - Fopp itself being one of my favourite Soundgarden songs and criminally left off the 'A-sides' compilation (which is puzzling given the fact that it was an A-side track, though the A-side 'My Wave' from superunknown was treated similarly).If you are new to Soundgarden, then I suggest you begin with 'A-sides' or, if like me you are averse to buying greatest hits albums, then Superunknown. If you own all the other albums and are are still passionate about the music, for the price Screaming Life/Fopp is a worthwhile purchase."
3,Whopper of a debut re-release.,"The ""Screaming Life"" EP is just awesome, while the four songs from the ""FOPP"" EP can be labled goofy at the least insulting. And, obviously, that's how they were intended to be. No band loops Godzilla-roars through a song in seriousness. Soundgarden were out from the beginning to make you snicker and poke your friend in the ribs, ""Did you get that one?""The breakneck speedpunk of ""Tears to Forget"" and religious denouncement in the scratchy-riff of ""Hand of God"" show their talent was already blooming. All signs point to their future originality, particularly in ""Nothing to Say,"" the standout of the CD. Heavy as HELL, with those mysteriously soaring vocals better than anything Plant ever wailed. SL/Fopp is not a CD for everyone, but a must for the hardcore fan."
3,Good Fence bad cursor,"Very good fence well worth the cost, especially compared to B'meyer (which I also have). The biggest achilles heel is the mag. cursor and parallax. Almost everyone has complained about this thing for years but yet Shop Fox does not offer an option to replace it. The real option is to make your own or buy one from B'meyer and drill and tap new holes. Sad, a 50 cent piece of plastic destroys million dollor reputation - repeately year after year! That is good management!"
5,Cute,A wonderful and cute story. Short in length and great for younger children (ages 2-4). Definately recommend.
3,functional,"I got this because I wanted a story to read my two and half year old to motivate him to make Valentines. It worked because it shows her making cards for her friends but it doesn't really mention what Valentine's Day is for. No explanation that it is a time when we celebrate our love for friends and family. Just it rained hearts, she made some Valentines, it never rained hearts again but she kept making Valentines.My son is most interested in seeing the friends and their valentines, but when those pictures come up the words are about something entirely different, so I usually make up the words at that point.Cute story, not a great ending, nice pictures. With a little extra work on my part, it did help my son understand making Valentines for friends."
5,The Day It Rained Hearts,"This was purchased as part of a Valentine's gift for a child and was surprisingly and quickly sent. It arrived on time and is being enjoyed, daily. Very well packaged and the service could not have been better."
1,Rained Disappointment!,"This book was very disappointing to me and to my Grand Daughter. It was written like a ""first book for baby"" even though it's supposed to be for the 4-8 year old age group! She just looked at me after I read it to her as if to say ""you've got to be kidding!"" I got other books for her, thankfully, as if this had been it my reputation for buying her great books would have been shot! Shame on Felicia Bond for this minimal effort."
3,Sweet,"I've been searching for cute Valentine's Day books and it seems to be a hard find. But, this book is sweet. My boys like seeing the different animals that receive the various Valentine's Day cards."
4,Like It,"It is a book, in fair condition, no tears, no issues. My son likes it and I read it quite often. Great little purchase!"
1,these are terrible; cause flat after flat,"I got four flats in 6 rides with these tires, and have a friend who had a similar experience. I tried different pressures, tubes and also replaced the liner on the wheel, but I still got flat after flat.I put another set of new tires on, and have not had a single flat since. what a waste of time and money these tires are. And I wore out the tires I used before I put these on, riding the same route, with hardly any flats."
4,Systematic Theology Logos/Libronix Bible software by Wayne Grudem,"This text is a well-ordered and concise (57 brief chapters--amazing for theological treatises) review of the important doctrines of the Christian faith. The author provides citations to the many traditions and handles controversial topics in an even-handed manner. With the Libronix system, the software is a good buy and makes the text accessible in more ways."
3,Real or Myth?,"This book tries to investigate the possibility of dragons among us in every culture. Though they were talked about as real in the past as the last remnants of dinosaurs, only the komodo dragon has been proven to be real, which I already knew. Historically, knights in the middle ages slew dragons as part of their code of chivalry. From every earth culture, are they real?"
1,Use Your Hard-Earned Money Elsewhere,"Wow was I disappointed with the performance of these clamps. First of all, they scratched and marred the wood faces to required extensive sanding to remove. Next, they are much more difficult to operate than advertised as the clamping pressure is lost when trying to squeeze together a joint (I was using dowels which can be very difficult to join). Finally, I found the removal of the clamps very awkward and had to release some of them with a hammer. I tried them twice, had equal results both times and found a final resting place on the bottom of a work shelf in the shop. Cool concept but the product quality lagged."
2,Not impressed,"This is a pretty dry book. First it helps to know a little French. Secondly, all this book does is throw in a couple hundred names of designers and places. Third, when the author speak of different designs which were created by people there are no images to back it up, so you really can't produce an image in your head of what the author is describing, the images that are in the book are mainly black and white and drawings which really didn't give me a sense of what the designer was trying to portray. As a designer I purchased this book to learn more about the art deco style, characteristics, elements, materials and influence, which is not what I found in this book."
5,Lovely and informative,"I'm amassing a collection of art deco books, and this is treasured among them for its historical thoroughness and beautiful pictures. I'm furnishing my '30s home and I find I just can't count on furniture store SAs to know what art deco is. Perusing the book, I am discovering what salient features to look for and just what kind of deco look is right for my situation, so I am armed with knowledge before I enter a store. The chapters include French Interiors, Streamline Moderne, Art Deco in public places (movie theaters, for example), and the revival of the '70s and '80s. Another deco book I recommend is by Young Mi Kim from the Architecture and Design Library."
2,Just send me what I saw! Not what you wanted me to have!,"I was lead to beleive that this was either new or in very good shape. It has a torn cover and I think it is missing a CD, but of this I am not sure."
5,"Great CD Player, Great Price!","Amazing, such a great CD player for a hundred dollars!A couple of notes: This unit does not have a remote, nor does it have a headphone jack. The next model up, the CDP CE375 has both of those, but otherwise these two models are exactly the same.Has a neat disc exchange function so you can change disks while a CD is playing.Has all the expected displays (time on a track, time left on a track, time left on the disk, which disk playing, songs left on CD)It's great, if you're looking for a CD player, and aren't an audiophile perfectionist (read: don't want to spend [a lot of money] for a CD player), then buy this one!"
3,Different from other Sony stuff...,"I like the player, it has great sound quality and is really solid.Cons:1. No support for mp3 playback2. No standby mode? I buy all Sony products and my tv, dvd player, vcr, and receiver have a standby mode, why doesn't this cd changer? strange... Nothing like turning on your whole system, then having to get up to turn on the cd player.3. ...You'd be better off buying the 300-disc jukebox for a little more and never changing a disc again. Or, buy a 5 disc dvd player and sell your single disc dvd player. Why take up double the rack space for something that just plays audio cd's?That's my review in a nutshell...I'm not impressed."
4,I don't need any more than this,"I want to order a CD changer (either Sony or Technics) and would like to know about the voltage before going ahead. Here in the UK we use 220V, I wonder whether the one I purchase off Amazonm will be compatible! Sorry, but I could not find this sort of info in the site, nor an e-form to send you this type of question."
3,The Eye+ Dark Water+The Grudge = Naina,"This film starts out as a straight out re-make or re-imagining of THE EYE. In the second act of the film you see parts of DARK WATER right down to the rain slicker. In act three you're in THE GRUDGE territory. It doesn't work as a horror film because if you've seen the other three movies you know what's coming. If you haven't seen the originals, this is a pale imitation despite the high production values. The fact that every body is speaking Hindu in England gives the whole thing a strange alternate-universe feel that was probably not intentional."
1,utter nonsense,"A woman who has been blind from a young age undergoes a cornea transplant in an attempt to restore her sight. Everything goes as planned and the woman can now see again, but the things she starts seeing aren't very pleasant, or original. This is an almost shot for shot ""remake"" of the Pang Brothers The EYE, with a little more color and a lot less scares. If you speak Hindi then this may be your thing, otherwise see the far superior Gin gwai - The Eye"
1,BAD JOB/OUTRAGEOUSLY OVER PRICED,Read the three reviews. Made my purchase. Was completely disappointed. Spend your money on the book by Daniel Goleman entitled SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE. This DVD is like a very bad meal in a five star Paris restaurant. Everyone says you are going to enjoy it because of the five stars... But you have been had once you get the check and find out no hooker came with it.
5,Civil War Life DVD's,"Great movies, none of the flash Hollywood about them just good representation of battles and decisions made under great stress. Coping with wounds and disabilities in the Civil War was not easy and human ingenuity and strength persevere in both stories."
4,Better than sugared candy.,"I often have gagging and coughing fits and I use candy to stop them. When I was using sugared candy, they caused my teeth to hurt. Not only are these better for your teeth, they taste better than the sugared candy. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is because I think the price is pretty steepl."
3,intense and wonderful.,The flavor in these is intense and wonderful. The only problem for me is that it says sugar free (and maybe they are) but watch out for the carbs because they have some and it can mess with your blood glucose levels so be careful other wise enjoy.
2,liked them not so much,I love the lifesaver's sugar free wintergreen bags but I didnt like the taste of these. Its not the lack of sugar since I knew that when buying them -- its the synthentic flavors. Orange is basically baby-aspirin taste. Pineapple flavor isnt so bad. I'll stick with the wintergreen from now on.
4,like them,Fast Delivery great item for the price. Way better prices than the stores. I especially liked the way they came in the suger free brand. Share them with my mom & sis.
2,SOMETIME WHAT LISTED IS NOT IN THE BAG,"Althought the item taste good so far in 5 bags open, there been little choice in flavors. Those 5 bags I open I have gotten, 1- pinapple, 2-3 cherry, 2-orange per bags (SO FAR) the rest have been the other flavors.Sorry I won't be recommending this product because each bag is limited in flavors so far (esp. the pinapple and orange)."
4,Great flavor,Life Savers sugarless candies are the best ones I've tried so far. The only problem I've found is with the packaging where sometimes you will get an uneven mix of flavors. One bag I got had exclusively pineapple flavor.
1,These used to be so GOOD,These used to be so good and I used to buy them by the bunch but ever since they switched from Aspartame to Sucralose they are the grossest most disgusting thing out there. Nevermind I hate the taste of Sucralose But I am one of the few I guess where Sucralose makes me violently ill. The Wintergreen ones still are amazing though because they are using Aspartame still but I don't see that lasting very long. Almost every sugar free product is switching to Sucralose.
2,Too sour!,"The lifesavers are kind of sour. I know they are sugar free but I don't remember life savers being so sour. I would have liked them a little sweeter. They should put ""Sour lifesavers"" on the package."
1,Not Worth The Money,"This product does not firm up loose skin at all. If that is what you're looking for, skip this product and save yourself some money."
2,an obscure and unclear character,"This book really didn't do anything for me. It is the story of a woman on a search for her child in an alien environment, where she amazes people by killing a running chicken by grabbing its neck, allowing herself to be seduced by an ex-husband, and finally putting herself in danger. While what is happening is under-stated, it adds up to a bunch of scenes that I just found confusing and not too interesting. Didion's writing style also didn't click for me, which is perhaps personal taste.Not recommended."
3,Close but no cigar,"Didion is a good writer but this novel does not capture the reader's attention at all. There is no suspense to keep you reading, and Didion leaves you with no emotional connection to the characters at all. I only gave it 3 stars because I had to give her credit for good writing."
4,Tight writing,"Just read the first page. If you like simple, tight writing, you're all in.I didn't like the plot, BUT I kept reading and turning pages.The author has been compared to Hemingway. Others say she has been influenced by him. Those more knowledgeable than me can make that call. The writing just flows. Enjoy."
3,Not for the Common Reader,"My first Joan Didion fiction. The story is told by a friend of Charlotte. Charlotte's daughter is missing having joined revolutionary forces in a fictional Caribbean country. Charlotte seems to be in stupor while searching for her daughter. Charlotte is harassed by her ex-husband. Didion's writing doesn't follow a chronological frame. As a result, I felt as lost as Charlotte in a foreign country. Her writing style took an adjustment on my part, but I look forward to re-reading this work or reading other novels by Ms. Didion."
3,Mediocre,"I really like Robin Williams but this disc was a bit of a let down. If you're a regular listener of comedy CDs, you'll detect a distinct lack of originality here. The comedy is -- dare I say -- kind of predictable. Williams needs to talk fast, because there isn't a lot worth dwelling on here. The low point is ""The Grim Rapper"" -- a musical number where Williams' comedy is set against a rap tune. Its the kind of [stuff] you hear on morning radio."
2,Good-ish,"This is pretty funny stuff, but hunks of the material are ripped off from other sources-- specifically, David Cross' ""Shut Up You F-ing Baby,"" which is ten times funnier than this. My tolerance for Williams' alleged ""zaniness"" is pretty low. The Second disk, with the city names, is weak."
4,Surprising retro to his older days,"My initial response to this CD was of relative shock at the amount of profanity on these discs, but in comparing it to other albums he's made in the past, Robin has always cursed often in his standup; it's just been awhile since he was on tour. With all of the serious and children-oriented roles he's taken in the last ten years or so, it's easy to forget how he got started.All that being said, he hasn't lost the touch at all! I found that I was laughing despite myself at several points, and in awe of the raw amount of energy he still has. His format has not changed much, either, as he skewers politicians, terrorism, celebrities, and silly American practices and vanities.The double disc format is a good one, as the listener gets a feel for the different crowds and cities that were played to over the course of the tour."
3,Pretty good,"I thought the jokes were great on this album, but it falls apart somewhere near the end, probably when he gets in on the subject of Viagra. Maybe it worked better as a visual gag (haven't seen the DVD yet), but as audio alone it was lame. The regional jokes on Disc 2 were okay, but his rap song ""The Grim Rapper"" did nothing for me. So overall, the album was just middling, and nowhere near as solid as his ""A Night at the Met"" album from the late '80s."
2,"5 Stars for Robin, 0 for the recording, 2.5 Average.","If you love Robin's Live on Broadway DVD, Do NOT buy this CD. While the jokes are almost the same, this CD is not the live recording of Robin's Live on Broadway's Beacon, NYC. Rather, it is a collection of the almost same materials (many of which will be later perfected in Beacon as you see on the DVD) performed through out other cities, which neither have the right environment nor the spontaneous audience as in New York City."
5,Laugh your ... off funny!!! This man is a genius!!!,"To those of you who like Robin Williams, I'd highly recommend this disc to any fan of this comic genius, b/c that is EXACTLY what he is!!! This man is 50 years old, and it is scary the amount of energy that he still has!!! However, he had not lost any of that comic edge in the past years!!! On this disc, he verbally butchers everyone from Michael Jackson and George W. Bush to Osama bin Laden, in the most comedic way!!! If you have seen the HBO special, BUY THIS CD!!! Either way, BUY THIS CD!!! You will not regret it!!!"
4,Excellent Plush,"This ""Puss In Boots"" looks just like the movie version and my child loved it! It doesn't come with the hat, so I had to make one, but other than that, it's great."
2,Terrible Controller,This controller is not very good. The recption doesn't go anywhere near the 30 ft mentioned. If you tilt the controller while playing you lose connection. The responsivness is not very good. This product is not worth it.
4,Works like a charm,"Portable, wireless, no problem with connection, better control playing fighting game then a game pad."
1,Doesn't work with PS2 slim,"We were really looking forward to this and would have liked to use it, but it was not compatible with PS2 slim."
4,"Some funny stories about North Pole, Alaska","Over forty vignettes and stories of people/characters who have lived in North Pole,(yes, there really is a town of North Pole, located 13 miles southeast of Fairbanks). Lots of local flavor about living in the land of the Midnight Sun where it can get minus 50 degrees during the winter. North Pole is not a cosmopolitan town by any means and this book will attest to that fact, with a bit of humor thrown in for good measure!"
5,Calling,"This CD is soothing and very enjoyable. Its great car music or music for just listening to. I love it! I'm telling you these are fabulous songs and Geri Halliwell is a phenomenal artist. I guarenty that you will like it if you buy it and listen to it. The CD contains the remixes of Calling her newest hit song and a lovely, relaxing french versen. For more great music by Geri Halliwell you could her buy her albums Schizophonic or Scream If Ya Wanna Go Faster."
1,Don't buy!,This battery is just awful. It has a battery life of about 10 pictures or 8 seconds of video making. I would have returned it but it would cost more to return it than to throw it away.[...]
3,"There's a reason why they're called B-sides, people...","I picked up this album about a year ago. That it took me this long to write a review is about how memorable the album actually is, but it necessitates a mention at least.""Memory Gospel"" figures prominently in Oliver Stone's ""Any Given Sunday"" (albeit remixed), and ""Flying Foxes"" probably should have been left on ""Play"". The rest is strictly fair-to-middling pap that you'll probably find as uninspiring as I did.In short, if you were a fan of the low-tempo stuff on ""Play"", you'll probably find this worth owning. But for pure ambient soundscape brilliance, check out KLF's ""Chill Out"" or The Orb's ""Live'93""."
5,"If the Internet Existed in ""1984""","""I hereby relinquish all rights and personal information to the United States Government. You MUST agree to this disclaimer to access the Internet."" - Therein lies the opening premise of ""The Developers,"" the specter of a troubling Orwellian intrusion into our personal liberties told in a deceptively simple story-style that moves from technology to lust to relationships to black mini-skirts, a tale told through prose studded with pop-culture references that will leave you wondering if you remember the right words to the Brady Bunch theme song. Read it if you like to laugh, read it if you ever worry about surfing the internet, read it if you like black mini-skirts."
5,A Definite Must Buy!!,"This book is extremely entertaining!! It was a a laugh out loud read at all the crazy twists and turns. Though it takes you through their very tecnological work lives, he still keeps you fully invested in them personally, drawing you in and making you feel for all the characters. I couldn't put the book down once I started. Butch is the greatest :)"
3,By me,This book was awsome! I'm 18 and i understood most of the references to previous decades. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good book to read.
5,"From ""Superman"" To Man","this book is one of the best books i have ever read!! all people black,white, jew, muslim dont matter should read this."
5,The Deception is the Key,"I had this book for five years before I finally picked it up to read and to my surprise, it was magnificent...an exciting verbal exchange between a politician whose knowledge regarding people is neglegeable and a porter whose knowledge of people is extensive. The two strike up a conversation first as servant to customer then ending as teacher informer to student learner. Its very passionate, engrossing and will keep your interest."
4,Excellent ELO Documentry,"ELO was one of the great pop/rock bands of the 1970's and continued to make music into the 80's. It is very hard to find documentaries or concert footage of this group. This DVD has some great insight into the formation and early years of ELO. If you are an ELO fan, you'll love this disc. I wish this was a more complete look at the bands career instead of ending in 1973. Also, it would have been nice to have heard from the band members rather then just music critics and insiders (I can never find any interviews with Jeff Lynne). Even with these omissions, the DVD is well worth the price and is very good."
5,the real elo-roy wood,this is great just to see roy wood -is a treat in it self-hopeful-a move dvd will come out. great job guys elo first album is the best hads down-5-star dvd -this dvd is a must for elo fans/roy wood fans and the move fans give us more roy wood.
5,Turns your router into a mini jointer!,"I use this in my router table in similar fashion to a vertical jointer. It's razor sharp, and leaves a smooth satin finish on delicate pine. Would also be great for cutting deep rebates or tenons, although I have not done so yet with this bit, I'm certain it'd be up to the task. Another review mentioned using this in a handheld router... I wouldn't recommend that with any router bit over 3/4"" in length or diameter for saftey's sake!"
2,Factory Defective**********,"As an Amazon PRIME member, I ordered the bit knowing it would arrive in time to use over the weekend. After opening the factory sealed package I noticed that the bit had a small ship in the blade profile that will result in a flaw in the wood cut. Unfortunately I will have to use it any way as I depended on the product arriving for use THIS weekend to meet a scheduled deadline. I will not be able to return it after it is used. I'm stuck using a ""defective"" bit. NOT Amazon's fault as it was packaged correctly and even 100% protected by the factory sealed package. It is apparent that the damage to the bit occurred in the factory and was not caught by any sort of ""quality control"" on Freud's part. EXAMINE PRODUCT FROM FREUD VERY CLOSELY UPON RECEIPT. IT SEEMS THEY HAVE A QUALITY CONTROL PROBLEM. Sigh...its always something."
5,Quality Product,"I am very satisfied with the performance of the Guide Gear 5-in-1 Jumpstarter / Power Station. It delivers performance and capability as advertised. I purchased this item for two main reasons.1. A backup air compressor and emergency jump starter for cold Montana winters.2. A DC power source for various astronomy related electronic components.It works superbly on both counts. It is a very good quality, heavy-duty piece of equipment.The only negative comment I can make is about the plastic protective shield covering the instrument panel for gauges and ports. It tends to get in the way with regular nightly use. However it does a good job protecting the instrument panel during inclement weather."
5,loved it,Product was slightly used as described but the quality of the CD was great. It was a gift and I get calls almost every day regarding what a great CD it is.
5,Slaughter - The Faith Life,"""The Faith Life"" by Alvin Slaughter is just what I was looking for. I needed spiritual music/lyrics that would touch my inner being and draw me closer to God. I looked at the different song titles which drew me to listen to a few and convinced me to purchase the CD. A friend recommended this CD and I'm glad she did. Uplifting.....takes you into worship......sits you down Father God. Try it for yourself!"
2,"a good deal of Hope, but no",this book began nicely. boats had been disappearing. descriptions of gigantic sea-creatures. good descriptions of the places in questioning. i was somehow reminded of Burroughs. then it got worse. a little bit of melodrama. the rescue operation took too much time and was too detailed. i just got more and more disappointed.
1,Gene,The Ecco City Light shoe does not have the support that I have come to expect from Ecco. It feels like a slipper. This shows the major disadvantage of shopping on line. You can't tell the quality of a product from a photo and you can't tell if or how the manufacturer has changed the product.
5,A must for any reader of Ayn Rand,"Most people will read this book for the intriguing way Gaitskill unfolds the characters relationship to their own sexuality and self image. The excerpt from this book that wasy in the anthology High Risk even focuses there and those qualities are supreme in this novel.But truth be told what I enjoyed most was her treatment of the Objectionist movement - she did a marvelous job of parodying it and pointing out how some people's ego can obscure the entire points they are trying to make.If you haven't read this book, please do! It succeeds on so many different levels!!"
2,Not Worth the Time,"Although I did manage to make it through this dense, self-obsessing, semi-actual, novel. I felt cheated. It seems we should spend our time reading better books. I did come to appreciate the character developement. I learned a new world - coprophiliac. It was not worth reading. Read the newspaper instead. Knit a scarf."
1,Depressing and disturbing-not worth the time to read it.,"The contrast between the two girls was an interesting starting point, but the disturbing, graphic descriptions of their sexual abuse/abuse of others and the emotional detachment that followed was depressing and not worth reading. Even the thinly veiled references to Ayn Rand and her followers weren't enough to make this awful book worthwhile.Don't bother with this."
1,"Run, don't walk away from this book","This book was dreadful. I figured a book that got so many flattering blurbs from reputable reviewers couldn't be all that bad, but I was mistaken. Awful. Just awful. Aside from the passages on Definitism, which were just dull, the rest of this book is descriptions either of childhood cruelty, garish teenage fashions, girls' faces covered with zit cream and bad makeup, or hideous, numbing incest and sadomasochism. The only reason I kept reading was that the back cover suggested something surprising was going to happen at the end. Yet page after page the story line meandered along, not really headed anywhere. At no point was I surprised. Disgusted certainly, but not surprised. Two thumbs down, way down."
4,"Brilliant and well-drawn, but with a clunky resolution","Gaitskill is funny and heartbreaking, and her descriptions of the cruelty and sexual confusion of Junior High School struck (uncomfortably) true, but the ending felt forced and totally out of line with the overall tone of the rest of the story. I loved her treatment of Rand and loved the switches from first person to third"
1,Would not have purchased this if the sadism had been addressed by my fellow readers.,"The fact that Gaitskill poses in interviews and photographs as a former call girl and stripper is the tip off, to me, that what is being performed in this book is far from authentic.My fellow readers, whom I trust, billed this as a satire of Ayn Rand and objectivism, which I was excited to read.But the many tiny flicks and gigantic chunks of s'n'm bs, so well-burnished you know the author was getting off instead of writing, offended me intensely.I stopped reading at page 94 at the throwaway metaphor, ""like an animal with its legs hacked off.""No."
4,"Good, Clean Fun","These guys continue to be funny. I appreciate the clean humor very much. In a profession where fowl is the name of the game, this is a welcome relief."
3,Worthwhile to buy it & watch it,"All 4 comics were funny but I most enjoyed Michael Jr. The end of his act was really funny, how he worked in different elements to instruct a white guy how to walk like a black guy."
3,the clean stand-up comedy tour,"Was not especially funny, bought for teen age boys but adults didn't really laugh much watching it either, others might enjoy"
2,not very funny,I bought this for our family as a clean comedy for Christmas time . . . . there were a few funny lines but over all we didn't find it worth the time or money.
5,"The Seller was awesome, but the DVD was not that great.","The seller was awesome, but the DVD was just okay. There were some funny parts but for the most part it wasn't that funny."
4,Excellent Introduction to Excellent Composers,"Simmons' book is an interesting, and very well written, survey of the works of six neo-romantic composers: Bloch, Hanson, Creston, Giannini, Barber, and Flagello. Each gets a chapter and each chapter begins with a brief biography. The remaining text is devoted to an analysis of major compositions.I have only two minor quibbles with this book. First, Simmons loves to use the terms ""sensibility"" and ""temperament"". To my mind, these are vague concepts. At least, I was never sure what he meant by them. The other difficulty is Simmons' penchant for dividing each composer's working life into periods. I was rather surprised to find that in five cases out of a possible six (Bloch was the exception), a composer's work could be divided into precisely three periods. Surely, that is either a huge coincidence or else forcing a convenient chronological straightjacket where it may not fit well."
2,My review of Javascript: In Easy Steps,"I am not a programmer. I am a person who designs web pages. Since this book was only ten bucks, I thought I would give it a try. This book does an ok job of teaching JavaScript. It will clearly walk you though each of the basic JavaScript functions and give you one example of how it works. You can download all the examples used in the book from their web site. However, this book does not teach you how to use functions together to build applications. I wish the book had exercises using combinations of JavaScript functions. It teaches you about the pieces but not how to put them together to build a simple application. I thought that teaching you how to build simple JavaScript applications would give you a greater understanding of how the functions work. Overall, this book is worth the ten dollars I paid for it. However, I will probably look for another JavaScript book with more practical applications."
4,Fantabulous CD!!! A MUST BUY!!!,"know music, been writing music for years now. Music is my life; I also write music professionally.So here is The Run Down:I've known of Profyle for a long time coming now from the songs:*Every Little Thing*(Can We) M.A.K.E. L.U.V.*I Wont Cry*OverjoyedSo I bought both their cds and was more than impressed! Some people are saying ""change the lead singer"" those people just dont get it, so let me enlighten you a little.They wanted a more rough lead singer, it adds bass, monotone, yet quality and a soothing touch. They are an awesome group. Buy the Cd PERIOD!JUST BUY THE DAMN CD ITS AWESOME!--------------------My Rating System is based on Amazon's:* = Hate It** = I Don't Like It*** = It's Ok**** = I Like It***** = I LOVE IT!--------------------"
3,The title of the cd says everything.........,"Profyle came with a whole different style for this album. I never heard the first one but I liked the single from the first one that they had out last year. This one takes it a step back with liar liar. this whole album is more ""Street"" than the first one and even has a clean and explicit version. You might not be able to imagine what they could be saying to have PA on there cd but one listen to some tracks like ""addicted"" and you will know why. I read some reviews in here about the album version of liar being different but the only difference is its long and they have a skit with a guy telling his girl to get out.Overall the album was decent but could have been better. Liar Liar is the best single on the album but ""Nasty"" with monifah could be another hit. best songs: 1,2,3,5,7,8,11,12"
3,Nothin' But Okay,"I am the Fan from MD who is always short with the words. Today I still have no words. This CD is just like the rest of the things you hear today nothing new. Strong song on the CD, track number 9 ""Can We Make Love""."
3,"It's Okay, BUT ITS' NOT ""R. KELLY.""","HEY, THIS HAS GOOD SONGS BUT NO DEEP LYRICS TO HELP YOU FEEL ANYTHING. PROFYLE REVIEW R. KELLY'S WORK AND COME BACK STRONG. DON'T TRY TO BE R. KELLY BUT LEARN FROM HIS LYRICS AND SOUND AND CREATE YOUR OWN STRONG VIBE! GOOD LUCK."
2,Nothing But Drama Is Nothing New. 4/10,"Profyle's first album ""Whispers In The Dark"" bombed in sales but Profyle made a comeback and just like their debute their second album ""Nothin But Drama"" also bombed. The album only served up one major hit. I really enjoyed their debute album but their new cd I really feel is the same old r&b that is manufactured and written by anyone but the artists.Well the best tracks on the album are ""Liar"", ""(Can We) M.A.K.E.L.U.V."", ""Damn"", and ""Nasty"", actually all the songs are pretty good but this is your run of the mill r&b music. Liar is an extroidenary song but the album just didn't live up to the expectations of Motown records or my expectations. The guys can sing though and you should definetily check out their debute album it is much better."
5,Same Exact Item/Different Amazon Location/Lower Price,Amazon has this items listed in a 2nd place - the UPC is the same but it's only $14.99Homedics MAN-150 Style Spa Plus Rechargeable 10 Piece Manicure System with 8 Attachments
4,worth getting,This product works pretty well. Could use alittle more power but gets the job done. Works better than others I have tried.
4,How powerful is it?,"I purchased the kit. It's adorable, rechargable and has several head tips. However, the power of it could be stronger in order to really do quicker filing. I'm a long time user of such equipment. Not a bad buy."
3,Bought this years ago,"I got this product a couple of years ago. My only complaint is it never held a charge very long. I did follow directions on how long to charge it etc. It works ok but it definately doesn't deliver ""professional"" results."
1,Homedics Style Spa Deluxe,"Major waste of money!! I would not recommend it to anyone. Has no power. When you attempt to perform any of the tasks one would expect the product to complete, i.e. ""filing"", the unit slows down so much, or actually comes to a complete stop, that it is useless."
3,GOOD MANICURE KIT,"It is a Great Manicure Kit, BUT what can you spect from the price? It is good have for emergencies, BUT...when you apply a little preasure it will Stop and the attachments...Three of them feld Off the Main Power tool!It OK for $20 Bucks, but NOT for me anymore, I am planning to get a better machine in the near future from a price of $120.00 like Pedi Nova III Nail Care System and I saw it on Amazon. com!Sincerely,C.A. Saint Louis, MO"
1,"Bought this, return it",Simply wasn't what I was looking for in a product. The attachments were not well constructed and I actually injured myself attempting to utilize the attachments. The buffer (which is what I bought this for) does not buff at all. Was not satisfied and would not recommend.
4,Passion Personified,"This disc is my first CD of Al Jarreau. I came to like him very much. His versatility of singing style is very attractive and surprising. Not like current hip-hop-centric R&B scene, but his music is fashionable by his own artistic modulation. Sound is also clear-cut. Not an extraordinary album, but I can feel very rich and happy everyday with his music."
5,HEAVENLY,"AWESOME CD. This is also an upgrade - so I have known all along what a good CD it is and all the tracks are just heavenly and amazing. Al has the greatest voice and what he does with his voice is just excellent. I love this purchase. Have it on cassette, but you know the CD just makes it the best way to listen to music instead of waiting to rewind, fast forward or just waiting for it to come back around. I love this CD. It is truly a fascinating musical tribute to how great Al Jarreau is. LOVE IT!"
3,Not one of the best.,Sorry but I must disagree with other reviewers here as IMHO this record doesn't live to natural expectations from such a great singer as Al Jarreau.Except for the tracks 1 and 2 this record suffers from a lack of inspired melody heard on other records. The quality of the sound is a little too bright and artificially processed. Definitely not recommended.
3,It grows on you [Memories of Santa Barbara Salad Days],"This is the best album Munkafust has released since their initial offering, ""Way Too Much Inertia"" (still my favorite). The opener, ""Control of My Heart,"" along with ""Feel My Pulse"" and the title track, ""Down For Days,"" stand out among this ecclectic collection of songs. Some others (""Yeah Yo,"" ""Helmet Party"") are a little too schticky for my taste, but musically they are solid tunes. The chorus of ""Helmet Party"" is strong--unfortunately, it is dragged down by the subject matter.Overall, I gave this album three stars for solid musicianship (thank the Lord for that UCSB music education!) and a few standout tracks. Upgrading the intellectual level of some of the content might have made this a four-star affair.For the time being, I'll enjoy this album for what it is and keep listening to ""Way Too Much Inertia."" [keep up the effort, Evan]"
3,SANFORD DISAPPOINTED ME IN THIS BOOK.,"I WAS TRULY DISAPPOINTED IN SANFORD'S LAST BOOK. iN HIS OTHER BOOKS THE THRILL CAME FROM NOT GUESSING WHO THE KILLER WAS, BUT FROM KNOWING THE MOVES OF LUCAS AND THE KILLER UNTIL THEY MEET. THIS BOOK REMINDED ME OF OTHER TRITE WRITERS WHERE YOU GUESS THE KILLER. TO ME THE THRILL ALWAYS CAME FROM THE CHESS GAME BETWEEN THE KILLER AND LUCAS (I COULD SEE TOM SELECK PLAYING ALEX). DON'T GET ME WRONG SANFORD IS ONE OF THE BEST AUTHORS TODAY. EVEN HIS BOOKS UNDER HIS REAL NAME (WHICH ESCAPES ME NOW) ARE EXTREMELY WELL WRITTEN. I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE "" ""EYES OF PREY"" AND ""SILENT PREY"" MADE INTO A MINI-SERIES."
4,Satisfying Read,"If I were John Sandford I would be pretty peeved that a major error was let go into print. As other people have mentioned, in Chapter 8, page 114, they are conducting an interview and are using the wrong name for the victim!! They use the name Wilson McDonald when they are referring to Daniel Kresge. It was rather frustrating to have such a blatant error in this part of the book. Other than this and the fact that Del's name is spelled two different ways, I enjoyed this book. I wasn't surprised about the relationship change either, after all, Lucas has had a different lover in every book. (Maybe he is getting a little old for this.) Good mystery, don't mind the killer is identified before the end, most people have probably figured it out by then anyway. Hard to put down, hated it to end. Can't wait for the next one!"
4,A good read.,"I have read all the Prey books, and I was not disappointed with this one. I carried it around the house with me and read it in record time. Some of the later Prey novels had gotten a bit gruesome for me, but I enjoyed this one. I agree with other readers, I didn't like the relationship change either."
3,"Very Slow Start, Good Twist",This book starts slow but toward the end there's an interesting twist. Wouldn't be my suggestion as your first Sandford book.
3,Worst of the prey series,"I will keep this short and sweet. The worst of the prey series. Do not be discouraged when you read this book. I have read every prey novel and they are wonderful, this one just happens to be a bomb."
4,A bit of a mixed bag but still mostly exciting,"The story starts very fast with a murder and then proceeds's with the investigation and turmoil resulting from it. The 'issue's' discussed in a previous review i personally found refreshing, it makes Davenport more 'real' and multi-layed. There are some 'flat' spots but overall the clip is pretty darn exciting..."
4,Very Davenport -- Quite Enjoyable,"I can see why this book didn't do as well as Sudden Prey. There was less action and more detecting in it. Yet, I found it to be extremely satisfying. The series is moving right along. I found the story to be clever and believable. I'm not disappointed at all."
4,Lucas is back to his old self!,"I've read every one of the Prey novels, and while I don't agree that SECRET PREY is the best of the lot, it is engrossing with lots of twists and turns.Lucas Davenport is back to his old sexy self (I, for one, was supremely bored with his ""domestication"" at the hands of Weather), the criminal in question is yet another hard edged psychopath (something Sandford does very well) and Davenport's new ""partner"" is definitely my kind of woman!All in all this is a must read for ""Prey..."" fans."
2,secret prey,"this book went to my 5 yr grandson instead of me, so I had to go out and buy it elsewhere. the book itself was great!"
4,"9th for Davenport - slow start, better ending","If you sat at your Mac trying to write a novel, what names might you give your characters? If you sat there too long, you might name one ""Del"", and add ""Capslock"" as a surname. This is perhaps what Sandford has done, but if you can get away from the clunky names, chances are you'll find this an enjoyable book. At times a slow read, it picks up the pace in the second half - although it's not too difficult to guess ""whodunit"", the question remains how many more characters will be killed off, and why? Sandford leads the reader down a bit of a blind alley in the first few chapters, but any more than that would give the story away..."
4,Nothing like a good Sandford,"I think I sound like a broken record while reviewing a Prey series book, but here it goes anyhow. The rich and well to do have trouble in their sect and Lucas has his hands full once again. The start with the hunting, the stuggle for power in the bank, the suspense of who the suspects are make a good story. Lucas a has attacks on his loved ones as well. Through it he manges his usual affair with a fine lady, this time a co-worker. The cast, Sloan, The chief, Del, Loring, Sherril all live up to their billing. The ""Cancun"" ending had me laughing. Again I look forward to the two ""Prey"" series books I've yet to read."
5,ANOTHER GREAT LUCAS DAVENPORT STORY!,"I LOVE LUCAS DAVENPORT! THIS IS A GREAT BOOK IN WHICH LUCAS DEALS WITH THE MURDER OF A BANK CEO. LOTS OF SUSPECTS AT THE BEGINNING....WAS GLAD LUCAS WAS ABLE TO ELIMINATE MANY QUICKLY AND NARROW THE LIST DOWN TO JUST A FEW. INTERESTING CHARACTERS AND VERY GOOD PLOT...DEFINITELY A PAGE TURNER DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE BOOK. A LITTLE HUMOR THROUGHOUT. IF YOU LOVE LUCAS, THIS IS A MUST READ!!fla"
3,Not Great,"This was not that great. I just held on till I found out who the killer was, then I had to force myself to finish it. Do not let this be your first book of the Prey Series. Trust me, the other books in the series are much, much better. I only suggest this book if you get bored and there is nothing else to read."
3,Too Much Language,"Here is a book you will enjoy for a well composed story line, a competant ""whodunit"" cut in the Earle Stanley Gardner style. Not many of us can relate to millionaires, but the author shows well how unfulling and shallow their lives are. It's great fun to root against them. But the ""good guys"", the cops, have too much emotional ""baggage"" and seem incapable of communicating without the full range of obscene language and sexual innuendo, and it seriously detracts from an otherwise intelligent novel. I didn't particularly appreciate the killer's identity being revealed as soon as it was, but the author seemed to handle it well."
4,Far from the dud that some reviewers here have suggested....,".......but Lucas Davenport is not as wild in this book as he has been in previous installments. He is having some ""issues"" (which makes him kind of boring in this instance). However, the story is fascinating. It is a worthwhile read."
3,"A disappointment in the ""Prey"" series.","The ""prey"" series has been one of the more fascinating and compelling detective dramas in recent years. This one is the least satisfying by far as Sandford seems to have lost his focus. The relationship of the suspects is contrived and inane and the police procedures, usually done well be Sandford, are uninteresting."
4,Another Great Lucas Davenport Mystery,"I believe this is one of the most underrated mystery/action series out there. John Sandford has given us another great situation for Lucas Davenport to work his great detective mind. The plot involves greed at many levels and the depths that people will go to get to the top. Meanwhile, Lucas deals with some of his personal demons as he tries to solve the case. The only negative to the book is that it tips us off with 100 pages left who the criminal really is. We know Lucas' will save the day. Can't wait for the next book, or for a movie to be made from the series of books."
3,"Good, not great","This is my third time into Sandford prey series and unfortunately they seem to be getting worse. I loved Mind Prey and was hoping that the rest of the Prey series were written in the same way, but Secret Prey was not.This crime thriller sees the reader again with Lucas Davenport trying to solve a murder of an extremely wealthy businessman - there are a number of possible suspects and one by one they get eliminated during the course of the book. Halfway through the book the reader finds out who the killer is, but it still takes Lucas a while to get there.I enjoyed this book, but it certainly didn't 'wow' me like Mind Prey as I felt that the last half of the book really didn't tell us anything new, it just made us follow Lucas' trail to the killer. I read this book in a few hours & I recommend it if you are looking for time to kill.I don't think that this is one of Sandford's best, but it is still entertaining."
1,Very Boring!,"As anyone who has read a few 'Prey' books will tell you, the first 50 pages are ALWAYS spine-tingling and terrifying. In this Prey book, we spend the first 100 pages going over all of the characters situations to encourage the reader to guess the killer's identity. This is done in a very slow and useless fashion. I don't think Sandford actually wrote this book, I think he had someone under 14 ghost-write this for him. By far, the worst Prey book."
2,"Sandford Misses with ""Secret Prey""","You'll spend more time learning how the Corporate hierarchy works than being entertained in this latest installment of the ""Prey"" series. However, Sandford does have a way with climactic description, namely the prelude to the altercation between Lucas and the hick cop, and then the final confrontation with the killer. An unbelievable prelude to his new relationship also detracts from the reading experience. But hey, he was due for a dud."
2,Return of a great character but a boring case.,"The best reason to read this book is to keep up with the latest developments of the central figure in the ""Prey"" series: Lucas Davenport. The ""Secret Prey"" villain generates no excitement, and is never a real threat to Davenport or the reader. Here's hoping the next ""Prey"" book brings back the active Davenport and an exciting and credible villain to interest us. This was just tedious and boring."
2,I hope the others are better than this,"This cannot possibly be the standard fare for an author so popular. Boring, slow, stupid, dull...I will try another one, One other one."
3,"""Prey"" series is becoming overly formulaic.","Although I enjoyed the latest installment of Davenport's adventures in the Twin Cities area, I am growing tired of the villain-who-will-strike-at-those-closest-to-Lucas's-heart. Not every perp has to be ultra-smart, but not brilliant enough to fool Davenport. Secret Prey was predictable and formulaic. Sandford should spend an extra couple of days editing the next in the series - or better, kill off Lucas and begin a more compelling storyline."
3,Chosen Prey,"Another very good book from Sandford. A good read, but not quite as good as some of his others. Would recommend it to a John Sandford fan.Chosen Prey (Lucas Davenport, No 12)"
1,Yaaawwwwnnnnn.....,"Well, this is my first attempt at reading a ""Prey"" novel. I really could not get much farther than the character ""Del Capslock""....I found that such a repulsive name for a character. Why not ""Tab Esc"" or ""Alt Shift""? How creative can the author be? And Davenport.....so many mundane issues...depression...all quite depressing really."
1,No Go,"Normally I don't review this way, but because so many people are venturing into the wonderful world of the Ipod I thought I give the heads-up. I can't get this program to run on my Mac. Yes, I have the right system requirements, and I promise I'm not a total moron who forgot to turn the computer on or something. Also, being a woman, I did read the instructions. No dice. I tried it on another one of my Macs, nothing. So either some copies of the program are flawed, or it is me, in which case beginners beware because I am not a beginner and the only way I'm getting a crunch out of this program is if I eat it."
3,"Crunch is Functional, But Limited","Roxio Crunch works okay for what it is intended, but most people are not going to want to pay for a program that can be found on the internet for free. The installation process is simple and, like I said, the program is functional, but it is not good for what I thought it should be able to do, which would be to burn backup copies of personal dvds. I already have an ipod video converter, this product is just not worthwhile unless it is upgraded to do more. This product lacks purpose."
3,Easy to use but too slow,"I agree with most of the reviewers here so, I won't go into much detail and I don't see the point in rehashing what others have already eloquently states. The product in question is relatively easy to use..on par with basic coversion softwares such as this. That is the end as far as positives for this product. The great let down and where this product loses major points is the time taken for conversion/backing up. I stopped one of the back-ups 1/4 of the way because I didn't have the time. I was a bit more generous and gave it 3 stars since this product has great potential to be improved."
1,"Won't convert commercial DVDs, others take forever!","The front of the box states this is ""The Essential Video Converter."" The first sentence on the back says ""Roxy Crunch helps you easily convert your DVDs, movies and TV shows...""Ha! I was really excited to get this product. In my work, I often have to study cartoons and movies, and being able to store them on my Mac would really save me time. Installing this software was easy, and it was easy to learn how to use. But then... it wouldn't convert ANY of my DVDs. Yes, it does say it won't convert copy-protected material, but that information is in small print on the bottom of the box.I finally found a DVD it would convert, a promotional freebie. However, just one 30-minute segment took over an hour to convert! Not exactly SAVING me time!For what it's worth, I have a dual processor G5 with 2G of memory."
2,Roxio Crunch for My mac,"I used this item a few times; however, it didn't function the way I hoped it would. I have since used other more funcional and professional items that I like."
1,Roxio Crunch too Slow,This product is too slow to run on a normal PC with Windows XP. The processor usage goes to 100% or the PC crashes. I have tried several PCs with lots of memory and with no other applications running. But... still the PC crashes. I contacted Roxio tech-support. They opened a trouble ticket but then closed it without resolving the issue. Further communications to Roxio have resulted in no replies. So... do not buy this application. Go to WinX DVD and evaluate their solutions. These solutions are more reasonably priced and in fact deliver the promised features. The definition of quality is... it does what it is supposed to do. Roxio Crunch does not do... what it is supposed to do.
3,Video converter for the iPod,"I just recently installed Roxio Crunch on my computer. I am running this software on a PC. It installed without any problems, although it does make you restart your computer after installation.I haven't had a chance to use this program very much, but it seems pretty simple to learn. This program allows you to convert video of various types (such as DVD video, AVI, QuickTime, H.264, DivX, etc.) so that you can watch them on an iPhone, video iPod, or an Apple TV."
2,Other products are better...,"I have to add my agreement to the other reviewers that this product doesn't do the one thing I wanted - convert a DVD for an iPod. I'm guessing it is an issue of copyright, but if I own the DVD why can't I watch it on my iPod? Plus, it is extremely limited in what products it is designed to work with.People who make home movies or personal films may find value in this software for converting those for the iPod, or uploading to youtube, but otherwise it is a complete waste. Other software programs do more for the same or less cost. It appears Roxio was so concerned with not stepping on copyright toes, they didn't bother giving consumers a useful product. Though I do not recommend Crunch, the new Roxio Creator Suite 10 is an excellent product for managing and manipulating multimedia."
2,not happy times,"I hate having to reboot my pc after installing a program, and this requires it. I couldn't convert any of my DVD's, and the only thing that would work were self-made movies of the dogs chasing a laser pointer. That tiny movie took what seemed like forever to convert, and made the computer run pretty slow... I really don't think this is a good program unless your sole purpose is to watch your home movies on your iPod... so unless you have really precious pets/kids or like to video practical jokes and such, I really don't think it's a good buy."
2,Better Choices Elsewhere,"It is indeed unfortunate that this company, which is known for its reliable software, would put out a product that is not an improvement of the video converter programs that already exist. Unlike some other users, I did not have any techincal problems converting various types of files. However, like everyone else, I did experience excrutiatingly slow conversion of files; much longer than the videos themselves. Moreover, I thought the user interface was not very intuitive and did not allow the user much in the way of customization. Look into dvdclonemobile or other programs mentioned in the other reviews. This company needs to demonstrate in a revised version why this program is necessary."
2,Not Worth The Price,"As far as paid products for compressing and ripping this just isn't up to snuff. It doesn't give you any idea on progress. There is a bar at the bottom when you are ripping something - but how long it will take is never known. There are free softwares that do a much better job of this. It is easy to install. Easy to understand. But doesn't do movies or music that is protected (which is like 99.9% of all movies). I wouldn't spend the money to buy this software, I'd download something for free."
1,The best part about crunch is that it's easy to un-install....,"What is it about media converters? No one can make a stable, fast one-click converter. I had my hopes up about Roxio, because I've used some of their software in the past, and it was decent. So I'll give it 1 star for Roxio the brand, and easy installation/un-installation.However, as other reviewers noted, the rest of it stinks. It's an absolute system hog, even though I'm running a 3.4 Ghz computer with 4 gigs of RAM.And then mid way through, my computer locked up and I had to reboot. Well, time for the uninstall.I wouldn't touch this with a ten foot stick, even if you gave me the stick."
1,Wish I'd read your reviews before buying . . .,"then perhaps I wouldn't be so disappointed! Roxio product description is pretty misleading, as I can't convert any of my movies to play on my ipod. What a waste."
1,Crunch by Roxio,"Roxio Crunch Win/Macworks, as far as converting video to an iPod formate--however, it can NOT rip DVDs that have copy protection, which most movie DVDs have. You will not be able to transfer your movies from DVD to your iPod.I was very disappointed that Roxio did not make this clear in their product description."
4,A great addition to an interesting war,The Seven Years war was a devastating time for France and Jonathan Dull tries to explain what happened in this great addition to the literature. It is a quick read and at times gets very heavy into the statistics. The basic problem of the French is they are outgunned and towards the end of the war outmaneuvered almost everywhere. Dull does a wonderful job with clear prose of illustrating this and it is a great book for someone who wants to learn more about the Seven Years war. This is not a good intro book to the war but once you have a basic sense it is a great way to expand your knowledge. It is highly recommend for colonial students that want to learn why the colonies shaped the way they did and how the dominance of France was replaced by an empire where the sun never sets.
3,Mistitled,"While purporting to be a book specifically about the French Navy during the Seven Years War, do not be fooled!! There is VERY LITTLE about the French Navy per se, but a LOT about the convoluted series of negotiations regarding the conduct of the war in Europe, and the actions and activity of the warring factions on the American frontier. While this has some interest in its own right, this is not why I bought the book! If you are looking to gain some insight into such NAVAL matters as the organisation of the French Navy, its logistics, operations, command structure, training, warships and warship designs of the period, you will be VERY disappointed!"
1,Not a Naval History,"This book is more about the colonial empire of France than it is about naval history. Great if that's your interest, but it was't mine, and it's not what I bought the book for. It is written in the dead hand style of academia, not even worth the one star the computer requires me to give it."
4,Easy to use,"I bought this product so I could do my own edging. I love it! No gas fumes, no cords, just gets the job done. I am able to do all my edging before it needs recharging. This was a great price for a great product!"
4,AFS is a disappointment..,"I really like going cordless and gasless with this trimmer, but the ""auto feed"" system is very poor. Most of the time the user actually only gets about three inches of trimming cord to use. Too bad they don't offer a ""bump-feed"" system, that would make it a great machine!"
1,Cheap case/trigger assembly,"Used my cordless trimmer twice and the switch case / plastic assembly fell apart. I could not get it back together because the screw holes joining both sides of the case were stripped out, almost as if they had been put together at the factory with a power tool. Not happy with the quality of the case of this product and would not buy it again."
3,ATT No Longer accepting New CallVantage Customers,"ATT is no longer accepting new CallVantage customers so confirm before you buy this product. Oct. 15, 2008"
3,AT&T Discontinuing CallVantage in 2009,Per a letter I just received AT&T is discontinuing this voip service sometime in 2009. Best look to another ATT product or to other voip providers.
2,Does not work well with others!,"My initial experience was very good, until I added a wireless internet video camera to my HOME LAN. Evidently, remote access to your HOME LAN is impossible with the D-Link DVG-1120M connected between your Cable/DSL modem and your router.Despite the information obtained from the AT&T; Call Vantage Support Web site(see ""Full Installation Guide"" identifying an option for connecting the D-Link DVG-1120M off of a router connected to your cable modem), you will get no support. My request to activate the AT&T; CallVantage D-Link DVG-1120M T/A in this configuration was refused, since it is ""not supported"" by AT&T; CallVantage.If you have no additional plans to take advantage of the many applications available for broadband internet access, then this should work fine. Otherwise, go with Linksys."
4,Quality Blade,"Well made blade. Holds up well and sharpens nice for a longer life.Others cheaper, but you pay for what you get!"
5,Get the ORIGINAL MASTER RECORDING version from MoFi!,"This is a cool album, but if you care about optimal sound quality, pay the extra bucks for the Hybrid SACD version from Mobile Fidelity Records. It totally rocks & even the CD layer is remastered using their GAIN 2 remastering system."
4,"good, not great","The place to start for the casual fan will be the double disc greates hits (a collection: not another band from east LA). Then, if you like the rocking songs on that collection with emphasis on good fret work, check out this cd. It is a quality cd, with no real duds at all, it just isn't great enough to earn five stars (what is these days?) give it a try..."
3,VERY AVERAGE,"This one is nothing more than mainstream rock, and while thatin it's self is not inherently bad, I've come to expect muchbetter from this band. I would recommend KIKO or BY THE LIGHTOF THE MOON instead, especially if you are a new comer to LOSLOBOS. THE NEIGHBORHOOD would also be an excellent choice. Ienjoy this band very much, but not this release. I hope theirnext offering sees them returning to form.Thanks,Tom"
3,Good Disc by A Great American Band,"This album stands beside such Lobas discs as This Time and Colossal Head. Not their best work, but damn solid. If you are a fan definitely worth it. The fidelity on the Hybrid SACD is superb,, but BUYER BEWARE - this is a stereo mix, NOT a 5.1 mix."
3,Excellent but not Great,"Wha?!? Well, across the greater span of Los Lobos' studio recordings others such as Kiko and The Neighborhood contain compositions that showcase this band's command of classic forms while demonstrating its penchant for fresh inventive interpretation within the rock-n-roll idiom. (Long sentence there; I know, sorry.) Ah-hem ... GMA offers glimmering performances of material that's mostly lost in the glare of its own high gloss finish. Still, there isn't a recording I can think of that Los Lobos fails to make remarkable."
4,WOW keep your significant other close by,What a book you will need help cooling down. This book has it all and it is not smutty (girl/girl;group;threesome;boy/girl).I have re-read this several times and each time it gets better.The only down fall to me was the control freak Katherine meets in the library and several other times. Katherine is in charge and knows what she wants throughout the book except with this guy. Seemed kinda wishy-washy. I would recommend this book to anyone
4,Three big hits and some undiscovered gems,"This 1983 disc produced two big hits: ""Almost Over You,"" a classic ballad that showcased Sheena's tender handling of sensitive material, and ""Telefone (Long Distance Love Affair),"" a poppy, new wave-styled number that was a bit of a departure for the Scottish singer. This was Sheena's first album recorded with American producers, and it features a more ""West Coast"" sound than her first three discs.The disc is solid on ballads, particularly Sheena's moving reading of Randy Newman's ""Just One Smile."" If some of the rock-oriented songs aren't particularly strong, including ""Let Sleeping Dogs Lie"" (a Pat Benatar clone), the sassy ""Best Kept Man"" and technopop ""Sweet Talk"" make up for it. Not her best effort, but solid all the way around. And the bonus tracks are first rate: Her smash cover of ""We've Got Tonight"" and a powerful reading of ""Wish You Were Here Tonight,"" also recorded by Ray Charles."
2,"Cute at first, but doesn't wash up","I LOVED the look of all the girly amy coe crib sheets when I first got them, but it only took a couple washings to figure out they DON'T HOLD UP! I bought this design and the plaid one, and not only do they shrink, but they've faded so badly you cannot see the design. I've only had the sheets 4 months, and I'm going to have to buy new ones for my daughter's bed now! Too bad -- it's too cute!"
3,Not bad.,"Its ok, but the new ""Fashion TV: In the mix"" is better. I was getting a bit bored with this one. Some of the songs really arent dance tracks or anything. More chillout or lounge music, but its still good."
5,Great buy!,"Love it. This is somewhere between a true red and a burgundy. It has a simple pulley system with a metal peg to adjust how open you want the umbrella. I've had it outside for about a month in a climate that changes from sunny to damp and rainy. The color has held up nicely and there are no signs of mold. For the price, you can't do much better. The pole is a cherry color that matches the wood feet and arms on the Camano Strathwood line. It goes great with the other Strathwood furniture I own."
3,"Rod and ball just fits my Moen, but not the thread.","Note: No o-ring was included in my kit, and it's not in the pic so I think the description may be wrong.If you are fixing a Moen:The ball is bigger than the original on my Moen. What I did was re-use the old threaded gray part, which was still on the sink, with the new rod and ball from this kit. In this way, I could only just screw on the plastic part, but it did go on and works fine.Before you buy one of these, if you still have the old ball and its rusted rod, see if you can push the ball further along the rod. You might not have to get a new one.BTW - does NOT contain the o-ring. (I had an o-ring assortment kit and got one to work, but keep this in mind.)"
4,Amazing debut,"I bought this album when it was released in 1991 on the advice of a friend who worked in a record shop. 11 years later, I still don't regret the purchase. Some of the interludes and sampling on the album border on the bizarre (Wilson, Etienne Gonna Die) but most of it is terrific, 60s-inspired pop. Spring and Nothing Can Stop Us are absolute classics....I still love those songs 11 years later and they always pop up on any CD compilation I burn, and their cover of Only Love Can Break Your Heart is fantastic. Incidentally, though many people compliment Sarah's vocals on that track, it is not Sarah singing, but the singer she replaced."
4,Good debut,"''Sarah's dreamy vocals is different from her opening number and this is the essence of her voice.''Daniel, the reason the vocal sounds different is because it's not Sarah Cracknell singing on that track.It's Moira Lambert from UK indie band Faith Over Reason.Apart from that,I bought this CD in 1992 soon after it came out. Tracks such as Only love can break your heart, Carnt Sleep, Spring and She's the One still sound fresh 15 years later."
5,Memories,This brought back memories that I had forgotten about. A great set of tunes although pricey...
4,not oasis,"not necessary to gush about this ingenous little band. At times I think that I listening to the Supremes....excellent choice for those that are looking relive the otherwise, musically bleak, early ninties."
2,Audio tampered,"The ""Sound Enhanced"" claim at the bottom of these TV GUIDE sets are warnings.It doesn't mean the existing audio track has been spruced up or filtered. In this case, the so-called enhancement is ovrrdubbed modern music that's used for titles, end credits and anywhere there's no dialogue.This sort of tampering is unforgivable!"
5,SOLVES dehydration and headaches!,"I love this unit so much that I bought another one so I am not having to switch it out between my regulator rigs! I used to get dehydrated, have cotton mouth and get nasty headaches when especially on long dives, and the Apollo Bio-Filter has solved all that! If there were a spot to give a unit 10+ stars this one would get them!"
3,When Mack Came Back,"I rate the book When Mack Came Back 3 stars because it did not have very much action but, my favorite part was when he heard the ghostly sound. Other than that the book was pretty boring exept when Maury`s brother Ben told that he got shot in both legs during World War II."
2,The Downhill Slide Continues...,"It had been going south (in a different way) for a little while, but this one sped up the process. It's not unlistenable (see""Hog Wild"") but it is a pale shadow of his earlier work. Don't go out of your way to get this."
4,"Not bad, but not the best of Bocephus","Although the 90's weren't the best of the Hank Jr. albums this one is decent. The biggest hit on this album by far is ths song Hotel Whiskey(feat. Clint Black) which talks about Hank's life as a ramblin' man and his times on the road, all the others songs are ok so for $5.98 you get what you pay for. And for those who gave this one star? It went gold back in 1992 and hit #7 on the country charts!"
4,very good band that no one has ever heard of...,"A really good band that no one has ever heard of. I could find very little on the internet. This is their only album. They played Lollapalooza '92 with Pearl Jam, Metallica, Ministry and the Peppers (I think I was there) and they played on the '97 tour under the name Illness. The guitarist has played with Herbie Hancock and Maceo Parker. That's it. But for 1 penny you can't go wrong!"
2,Unique typeset,"Unsure why, but the portions of this book that contain Will Allen's notes/letters were all garbled, as if they were typeset incorrectly - an example would be the phrase ""I am feeling sad today"" came out looking ""Ia mfe elings adtod ay"".I know the author, and this most definitely was NOT how she sent it to the publisher, and other copies are printed just fine.Someone should tell the seller that the result is, that more than half the book is unreadable.Rick S."
4,captivating,I found this book very captivating and absorbing. My heart was full of tears reading this book. I would recommend this book to anybody especially people like me living in states and not fully aware how events took place in this sad story of Pakistan
1,on - off switch,Second time used the on - off switch fell apart. Not a good design.Spray pattern is so -so
1,Junk,"Worked great the first time.....day 2 it would not start/no power nothing! double checked everything my outlet fine, circut breaker fine, cord fine. Never again will I but Black/Decker!"
1,total POS and bad service,"The GCFI plug was bad from the get go.I requested B&D; to send a new plug but they wanted to play BS games instead of sending me one.I find it hard to believe that they would treat what presumably is a electric shock hazed in such a cavalier manner.The deal is this!: When a customer request some cheap part to effect a repair on your crappy product, just send the guy the FN part.Black & Decker chose to take the chicken sh!t course, so be it, I will not be purchasing anything with their logo on it.""Black & Decker is English for caveat emptor"""
2,Not for everybody,Too much money for a home made video!Art ist using professional gunsmithing machines - the amateur uses what?
4,Good IEEE-1394/ Firewire / DV cable,I whish it could be less stiff but it is robust.It's works great to transfer my DV camcorder movies to a DVD recorder.I loved the prompt delivery.
4,Inexpensive Cable,I bought this cable to connect a Cannon ZR850 Camcorder to laptop PC through IEEE-1394 Firewire port. The cable is strong but flexible and easy to use.
5,Good cable,"The product is good, and i was able to transfer my videos to computer.the only negative i noted is that the cable is little stiff and need a bigger turn radius."
3,It works,I'm using this item to connect my Canon Mini DV camcorder to a Panasonic DVD Recorder and it works fine. I would point out the connectors are not gold plated as they appear in the picture.
1,Works at First then Dies Quickly,"This product works immediately out of the box. However after about seven or so uses something happens and the cables don't work. As if there was a burn out of some sort. I have purchased two of these and it was the same result. You never see the problem coming. I'm a video journalist for a major NY newspaper website and it is the worst thing in the world to have a story due then have a cable suddenly just not function. You get what you pay for. There's a reason why the price is the price. Take your chances if your work doesn't matter. If your work means anything, invest in it."
1,Do not buy - poor quality,"What you pay is what you get. This is a cheap cable with very poor quality video/audio transfer. fuzzy lines and constant flicker on video. Used same TV set, same recorded footage from the same camcorder, same miniDV tape, and same DV recorder device; plus, used another cable of same type from Frys. Equal comparison - I am getting far better quality with comparable cable from Frys and better quality with my regular cheap AV cable. So, I will trash this cable."
1,dropped frames galore,"I bought this cable because it had so many good reviews. It worked the first few times I used it, but now when I capture video from my hv20, I get hundreds of dropped frames, in even 1 or 2 minutes of footage. Now I have to buy a brand new cable ... Ugh."
2,connection sometime lost,"The price for the cable is good. But during recording, sometime it lost conection, the recorder can not recognize the camcorder the cable connected, so I have to pull out and reconnect again."
1,cable did not fit in the camera socket,I disappointed with the cable pins did not fit in the digital camera socket but can fit in the DVD-recorder player's socket for DV-input. It's disappointing.
1,Not Good. It's cheap. Oh well. You get what you pay for.,"I thought I would try and see if this very, very, very cheap cable would work for me. It did work for about 5 or 6 transfers and then it stopped and was acting up and I couldn't get it to work again. Oh well, I guess the adage is right on."
1,Firewire Cable,"Was not compatible with iMac. Too expensive to return for an exchange, so was of no use."
5,"excelent product, excelent seler, worth for the money","I purchased product in time , excelent product, worth for money, excelent seler"
5,It works great!,I bought it to connect my old Canon digital video camcorder ZR100 to my new Song Vaio computer which as an i-link port. It works perfectly! Transfering video to my computer has never been so easy before! This is a cheap and easy option.
2,Works ok but Mis-representation,"After 2 years of my purchase I still see ""The item shown on the Amazon.com is different than what they deliver. When I contacted the seller last time he says its Amazon's problem and the wrong image still shows on the site, its disgusting and I am shocked that neither seller nor amazon is bothered about their falling customer service quality."""
1,Mine didn't work.,"My computer didn't recognize any devices when I used this cord, so there goes five bucks."
3,Good for the price,Good for the price. Shopped around and felt this was the best combination of price and performance and buying from Amazon was a safe bet.
5,works good!,got this to use with a canon camcorder for digital download of video to computer. transfers without dropped frames and is solid construction.
3,"Did not work and was not 2 Meters long, refund immediate",I gave this a 3 star rating only because the refund was immediate and return of defective cable not needed. The cable did not work and was not the correct length. The description was a 2 M cable and it was about 5 1/2 feet long. The cable did not work. If I did not have a working cable this would have been a puzzle.
4,good product,"I am using this to replace an older cable, and it works right away. Good product, and it doesn't cost a lot!"
1,Very disapointed,"After paying $8 for this 4-pin to 4-pin cable, I thought I would receive it in the mail, since it is what I happened to buy. Little did I know that crooks are everywhere and you can never be too certain of who is honest or not. The truth is, it never came in the mail but I choose not to complain about it (except for this review) because I simply do not have the time. I hope the thief is satisfied with his $8 and I am certain that I will never buy anything from the same seller again. I hope enough people read this review so they will never buy anything from this untrustworthy seller."
5,4 Pin to 4 Pin IEEE-1394 Firewire Cable-2 Meters,"Came quickly, got it for a replacement and works for the purpose intended. Very good value for the price. Would buy again."
3,Not sure if it is the cable or my camera,"I purchased this cable to transfer dv video from my camera to my laptop. The cable (once it arrived) was well packaged, and I had no issue with the external aesthetics of the cable itself. After I started digitizing the video, the result was less than expected and I cannot use it for my final output. I do not know if it is the cable itself that is affecting the quality of the video, or if it is the camera itself. I have never had any issues with the camera previously and it has been stored in its own bag since it was purchased 7+ years ago. When I find a different cable, I will try again and post my findings here."
5,Excellent for the price,"These cables were so inexpensive that I bought 3 when I only needed 1. I thought they might be cheaply made so maybe 1 out of the 3 ought to work. It turns out all 3 cables worked fine and the quality is what you would find at your local retailer (with the exception of the big brand name cable makers).All in all, a good deal."
2,"It works, but...","Works great and transfers well. I am using it for to connect to my JVC GRD-73US to my laptop. Nevertheless, the one I received was not 2 meters. It was very short. Just a little warning for those who need it to be 2 meters. (It was more like 2 feet, not 2 meters!)"

5,coloring,Great for the price. I may buy a second. My daughter even keeps up after it putting it away properly at 4 since she likes it so much.
1,DO NOT BUY,"The birth bone charm is junk and is not worth the price. I am in the process of returning it. The item they sent did not match its picture, should have been all pink, instead it was pink with opal white stones. I let my dog wear it for a few days to see if it would grow on me and instead it has lost several of its stones. For close to $30 it should not loose any, ever. Save your money and get a $0.50 toy for a gumball machine as it will be better constructed."
3,No instruction for customizing iron,"The description does not say what is in the iron, like ""Handcrafted by yo name"". Better provide detailed procedures. Otherwise I have to cancel the order after checking what is in the iron. And in worst case, they may not accept the return because it's customized item."
3,good unit but,Everything is OK with the woodburner but the ends of the flat brass are too long; it would be nicer if these were cut off close to the words; it would be easier to see under the head when using it.
2,still waiting for head piece,"received in about a week from amazon. then there's a form to send into wall lenk to get the customized head. that's supposed to take up to two weeks. called 'em after two weeks; machines are down and will be fixed in a few more days. i am coming up on the fourth week after sending the form to wall lenk. just called and will be receiving the custom head after 4 weeks of sending in the form. i have two projects that have been sitting and waiting to get branded. for saving a few bucks... you make the call. approximately 5 weeks lead time after ordering from amazon. once i finally get it, i am assuming it will work properly."
2,For therapists and serious problem cases only!,"This book not only shares the horrifying tales of several unhealthy mother/daughter relationships, but it also examines the process of actually sharing those stories -- how women remember and retell the tales. A therapist might find such analysis interesting, but the average reader will not. Also, the stories are WAY beyond what most of us think of as struggles with our moms or daughters."
4,Shows in wrong order,"It's a good set. Picture is clear, but there is one odd thing. The shows on Disc 4 are not in the correct order of when they aired. The synopsis on the box is correct."
3,love/hate,I am A HUGE FAN of Will & Grace and I honestly think that someone was spying on my life when they were writing Graces character. HOWEVER season 2 DVD is awfully made. The Font and the photo-shopped pictures are not attractive at all and I was SO DISSAPOINTED whenever the season finale did not include the the 2nd part!!!
5,Will and Grace Season Two,Great DVD. Even though I have been a fan of the Will and Grace show for years it is fun to go back and watch the earlier seasons again. I bought this product from Amazon and it was received in excellent condition. The mailing was very prompt. The whole buying experience was very easy. I was extemely pleased with my decision to purchase through Amazon.
2,False Advertising,"This DVD is a case of false advertising. Even if you disregard the promotional hype that the Second Season Edition contains ""Outtakes"" and ""Commentaries"", the cover of the box set proclaims it is ""Loaded With Extras"". It is loaded all right, but not with extras. It is loaded with mistakes and printing errors. And no ""Commentaries"" or ""Outtakes"". There is no excuse for a DVD Video company to be so careless with their product. Indexes and menus are intended to help the viewers navigate the programs, not hinder them. Criticism aside, I bought this box set because I am a fan of the show. The episodes are funny and entertaining, even if the final product is not. Shame on NBC Home Entertainment. You are a disappointment."
2,Not what I expected,"The Season 2 DVD box set of ""Will & Grace"" was released on March 23rd. The 4-disc set includes all of the season 2 episodes along with 12 featurettes. Previously specified outtakes and commentary tracks were not included. The set also contains numerous print errors and mastering errors. Errors include: mis-aligned cursor graphics in the menus on 16x9 televisions; incorrect episode order (particularly Disc 4); featurettes are spread across all 4 discs - not on disc 3 as printed; one-hour season finale split into two episodes rather than shown as originally aired (and are the first 2 episodes on Disc 4); episodes not on the disc specified in the print; episodes missing content aired in the original broadcast (""Ben? Her?"" Part 1 is missing a line, while Part 2 has a rather large edit at the beginning); front cover is mis-printed with ""Loaded With Extra Features."" On a positive note, the season as a whole has many top-notch episodes."
2,The box listing does not match what's on the DVDs,"This is either a case of sloppy copyediting or rushing in production. The DVDs do not contain the episodes as listed on the box, which makes finding a certain episode next to impossible. Disappointing."
5,Favorite show,It was really good seems like new i really recommend it plus Will n grace is my fav show.Im collecting all the seasons
1,Did not receive,I did not receive this item. I emailed the seller through Amazon.com and I got no response. This is all very unfortunate to me because I have never had any sort of problem when buying stuff through Amazon.com
3,Alright!,"Will & Grace was pretty funny. Their best season I believe. The first and second seasons are the only good ones. Half way through season 3 it got bad, really bad. And today in the Will and Grace world, season six, it is still just tastless and stupid. Another thing is I have a problem liking any of the characters besides Grace. They are all too flat or something. Anyway get season one & two and forget the rest of Will & Grace seasons ever happened."
1,If They Keep Saying It's A Classic Long Enough....,"I've seen enough of this show--because it's in syndication more than MASH--to realize that I have never laughed once at anything on it. They're even running episodes on airplanes after the movie, so I can't even get away from this ""I Love Lucy for the New Millenium"" thirty thousand feet off the ground.When I say that WILL & GRACE is a lame sitcom, you should see the way some people react. I'm not saying it doesn't have a right to exist, that the cause of civil rights needs to beaten down to the ground, that internment camps should be built. I'm just saying that this show is NOT FUNNY.And, folks, it's not a hate crime to dislike this show.Calm. Down."
5,Lot's of Laughter,"Great laughs in this season, you will enjoy this season.I can't wait to collect all 8!"
3,Some things are a little off,First of all I would like to say that this was a great season. Just about every episode has numerous laugh out loud moments and the cast had really found their tone. That is probably why this season won Emmy's for Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally and over all Best Comedy Series. However the DVD needs work. First of all the themed featurettes are cute but they are a little repeatitive. It was advertised that this would have a blooper reel and commentary which I was really looking forward too. Unfourtunatley the only thing we have for special features are the themed featurettes. At least season 1 had an interview. Another thing on disc 4 the episodes are all out of order and there are episodes that are on one disc when according to the cover they are supposed to be on other discs. Great show but the DVD needs work.
2,Fine season in awful DVD presentation,"While many have observed the Season 2 finale, presented in this set as two parts, carelessly appears at the *beginning* of Disc 4 rather than the end, no one has pointed out that the original broadcast of the Season 2 finale was NOT in two parts at all: it was an hour-long episode. The two-part division was made for later syndicated reruns. More importantly, substantial cuts were also made, totalling three missing minutes. As I read on this site, this shameful situation is the same in all of Seasons 5 and 6 (probably 7 and 8 as well), where the cut, syndicated versions are used--the same ones people can see for free in daily TV reruns. We buy TV shows on DVD to see them in their original form, so with many Will & Grace DVDs, we're getting cheated."
4,W&G Season 2 BEST!....but where are outtakes?,"Will & Grace is one of the best comedy shows ever done on television. I have Season One on DVD and bought Season Two the day it released. The DVD is great, but where are the commentaries and outtakes as promised? Did I miss them? I can't find them but I did find the themed featurettes as in Season One which are great. If anyone knows about why the outtakes are not on there or if they're hidden please email me. Thanks!"
5,"Great Episodes, Mediocre DVD","This is some of the best Will & Grace of all time! I'm getting hours of enjoyment out of this DVD set. Others have been complaining about the fact that some episodes are out of order, and that is true. However, this is still an outstanding set with a wonderful value. You'll be a little confused at first about the fact that, due to the mix-up, Will magically teleports from the Caribbean island to New York, but that's a very small detail. Buy it!"
5,Will & Grace - Season Two,This was a great way for me to watch one of my favorite shows over and over again.
5,WAG DVD's,WAG DVD's are a classic and will never go out of style. Does not matter how many times i watch it - it feels like i am watching it for the first time. Rock on WAG.
4,Excellent,Love mac & cheese - it's definitely better than the kraft/velveeta stuff. More fun/easier to eat rotini pasta than shell pasta too. :-\
2,salty,"very sad to say that this is salty, no I mean SALTY! Will try something else for my son. Annie, please make these less salty and I will try them again."
1,An absolute piece of garbage,"It lasted about 10 months before getting screwy (sometimes wouldn't turn on, sometimes turn on but no video) and now after about a year it is dead a sa doornail."
5,"GWAR's 2nd Heaviest, GWAR's 2nd Best","America Must Be Destroyed is a very underrated metal classic along with many other GWAR albums but this album every metalhead should give a listen to. Every song on this album is good but stand out tracks include ""Ham on the Bone"", ""Crack in the Egg"", ""Gor-Gor"", ""Have you Seen Me"", ""Blimey"", ""Gilded Lily"", ""Rock N' Roll Never Felt so Good"" and the less heavy but amazing ""Road Behind"". This is their second heaviest album and in my opinion their second best. If you're into metal I recommend picking this album up. You won't be dissapointed"
5,THE #1 GWAR Album!,"GWAR is ridiculous and disgusting...and I love them! This is the album that got me hooked. I had heard Hell-O and Scumdogs previously, but this album is far superior. Their music is somewhere between metal and punk with lyrics that would send your parents into shock! Nasty stuff! GWAR has inspired my music alot. Especially this album."
5,An Experience Not To Miss!,"I was shown the true nature of the beast long ago at the Maquerade in Atlanta. GWAR on stage. I came out of there looking like a bruised Smurf, all red blue and green. The music was great, and the excitement level could not be matched. This album is my favorite, with great lyrics, and a surprising variety of tunes. Buy it!"
1,It's absolute GARBAGE!!!!!,"Listen I heard this album and it was terrible! It doesn't even deserve 1 star. All this band is guy's dressed up in plastic viking costumes screaming at the top of their lungs about death. If you wan't a good album, get Korn, Limp Bizkit, or the Beastie boys! Don't waste your money on this one!!"
5,"inexpensive, accurate, no batteries required.","Didn't want the hassle of changing batteries, but wanted accuracy. This does the job and price was right. Accurate readings 99 % of the time."
2,Scale,It stuck at one weight and could not get it to go back to 0. no matter what I tried. Not happy and returned it.
2,Foot area too small,"The first one of these they sent was completely broken. All the spring loaded pieces inside were disconnected. The company easily and without question sent me a new one. Great.Bad news is the foot/standing area is too small for a man's size 9 foot. You have to stand on the dial which is completely unnecessarily large. If you try to squeeze your feet onto the platform, you run the risk of having them be too close to the edge which will render your weight a little low.This thing is all around poorly designed. Would not recommend this to buy."
1,Completely inaccurate,"This scale is horrible. The building quality is good, but it's off by zero to twelve pounds! I thought my weight was staying constant, but I was actually gaining weight. This scale destroyed my diet. Zero stars."
3,ok,"every time you get off the scale it's changed by 2-4 lbs., which leaves you wondering what the heck you really weigh. i don't think it should move/vary that much."
2,Not good.,I returned this scale. Each time i would step on this scale my weight would fluctuate between 2-5 pounds. I would have to reset it to zero most of the time.
2,faulty scale,Scale did not work when I received it. Had to send it back and have not received credit for it yet.
4,Much more accurate than a digital scale,I was looking for an analog scale as my mid-priced digital would give me a different reading every time I stepped on it. This is a nice unit which is consistently accurate.
2,Professional Taylor Bath Scales,"To whom It may concern,They are extremly nice in appearce and the abillity to see your weight if you are old is excellent.My only complain is they didn't last long, They are weighing wrong and no way to ajust them , not even the roller in the front will ajust them.Your truly,Upset and Madp.s. Upset because I really like them, and mad cause when you are on a fix income you don't have the money to send them in for repairs."
4,easy to read,"Nice scale. Light wieght, Very easy to read, has four seperate markers to remember your last wieght.Im happy with it"
5,Great Product!,"Works great, price was awesome. I had a high tech digital scale that fluctuated terribly. This scale is extremely accurate! Everything i wanted it to be"
1,Poorest Customer Service Ever,"Ordered 1130T scale and a week later a box containing two scales of a different product style arrived from Taylor via Amazon. Customer service announced they'd made no error. Well I responded that's pretty interesting as I have two scales here neither are what I ordered. We can't help you as we show no error they replied. The scales I have are cheaper model with no colored indicator like the 1130t offered. My response, don't but from Taylor furthermore don't but from dealers thru amazon. Buy direct."
2,small feet and light people maybe,"I weigh about 220 and have size 13 feet....not huge...just on the large side.The scale is already creaking and losing accuracy after 3 months of use about 5 times a week.ALSO, I get a very different reading if I keep my feet off the window.The only accurate reading is when my feet are over the window portion.If you are over 150 LBS or a size 8 shoe or so, I would find a more substantial unit."
5,"loved it as a child, buying it for a grandson.","I loved these stories at ages 9 and 10 (almost 60 years ago) and they led me to interests in history, archaeology, and many other kinds of books.My grandson (turning 9) loves modern versions of myths, so it is time for him to have this treasure."
2,Not for play--too delicate,"This item is unique and enticing for a young boy, but it is very delicate and breaks easily. I would not purchase if it is meant for play or use."
4,Sumerian Laments,"Oh Angry Sea, by Raphael Kutscher, is a well-organized treatise on the purpose and form of the Sumerian lamentation genre. He carefully analyzes the various surviving tablets of this composition and offers helpful and insightful suggestions regarding obscure words and variant readings. Included are several well-shot photographs of the major tablets. Some of the photos are clear enough to actually read the Sumerian. This is a difficult achievement and Kutscher is to be commended for his effort. In addition, a concise and well researched Sumerian-English glossary is provided at the back with documentation as to where each specific word is located in the lament. This book is well-written, carefully researched, and presented in an appropriate format. Excellent and worth owning, particularly if you are familiar with the Sumerian language. I have not regretted purchasing this book at all."
5,Creme Savers,I am a Type 1 diabetic...I am subject tolow blood sugars...I always carrie a plastic sandwich bag of thewe in the car and in my pocketbook and whenever I felt I might be falling bloodsugar I would eat about 3 of them about 1 carb. Not only did it bring up my slood sugar but I enjoyed every mnute of them...Alas they stopped making them...I used to order them by the carton from Amazon!!!
1,Creme-Save your Money,"I love the original flavors, rasberries strawberries and oranges and creme. They are extremely rich in taste, and you only need one...or two..okay i will eat the whole bag, Anyway the tropical collection is a big nasty yucko. Mango and creme just tastes ""off"" I love mangos it just taste like a bizarro version of the fruit. The Banana and creme is the best of the three but again its that strong fake flavor. The Pina Colada.....is well, its like sucking on a vat of coconut oil. Nasty. I would recommend sticking to the originals."
5,In Christ Alone,Mary did you know? and in Christ Alone! warms the heart and moves the spirit. I beacame familiar with his ministry while watching the Trinity Broadcasting Network. His praises to God is felt in every song. Keep up the God work Michael.
1,Not Very Good,"Yes, it is cheap but it doesn't work well. Corks don't set well and corker has only one setting.Corks are too high above bottle rim.Also requires two people to use.Addendum: Bought a floor corker for less than $80.Great product well worth the money."
4,Double Lever Corker,"Actually I have two of these--one I bought years ago (and is in a different location, so it was easier to buy a new one than go and retrieve the old one). The older corker is built a little better than this one, but this one works okay. Simple to operate. It does require a bit of strength, but not unreasonably so.It's best to work near running water since the corks and the barrel of the corker must be wet when the corks are inserted."
4,It'll do...,"I helped a friend bottle wine this weekend...he had an older version of this corker. Since this current version doesn't have an adjustment to keep the cork from being pushed too far down the neck, maybe a Zip Tie applied to the top of the piston will help. I've ordered one of these, and some of the comments almost made me want to cancel the order, but I will use Zip Tie to keep cork from going too far."
3,Pumpkin Sed Oil,"Indeed, as the first reviewer stated this is a wonderful, fragrant oil and it does come in a glass bottle, which is a plus. I just wish the oil was be organic but it isn't!"
2,VOR: Island of Power,"This book was so-so at best.Most of the novels failed to stick to the VOR setting they were portrayed in. This novel accomplished that which makes it better than every other VOR novel than the Playback War in my opinion. Though it gave good depictions of a setting in the Vor: The Maelstrom it lacked a compelling plot. This novel isn't a mystery, not a romance, no great tales of heroism, camaraderie, or anything else. The whole story is summed up in a group of people race against undead aliens to the center of a mysterious island then race off before it vanishes, The End."
3,Phone,We had bought this for our 9yr daughter last Christmas. We just had to get rid of it. It no longer works which is a bummer. The Caller ID screen was a great idea if you could see it. The night time was the best. Any light and it was hard to read. My daughter loved it. We now have gone cordless.
4,"Funny, inspiring and heartbreaking...","This CD came out during my formative years and spoke to so many of my adolescent feelings, and I've loved it ever since. Meryn cuts to the quick on tracks with her fierce, piercing lyrical genius. From funny anecdotal spoken word tracks such as ""Flight Attendant"" and ""Job Application"", to haunting melodies on ""I Say"" and ""Barbie"". There's so much more here than the quirky ""The Sweater"" that's worth listening to. I hope the re-issue can speak to those coming of age now like it did when when originally released."
2,Not Great for Kindergarten Prep.,"This is a great book to give moms a programmed way to spend time with a 3 or 4 year old preschool child. I bought this for my oldest as a substitute to paying for preschool the year before kindergarten. Now that I he is a 2nd grader, and my next oldest is just finishing at a professional preschool, I can see that the book is seriously lacking in explaining how to prepare your child for kindergarten. A good preschool will mimic kindergarten by having a routine with the children where weather, numbers, handwriting, reading, fine motor skills (cutting and gluing), large motor skills, and structured play are built in every day. Typically with stations to rotate through. The themes are added in to give meaning to each practiced skill. Each chapter in this book has themes and ideas for exploring that theme, but very little about these valuable routines or what will be expected in kindergarten."
2,NOT ORIGINAL GROUP,This doesn't sound like the original recordings. Always buy the Mercury / Universal recordings. You vcan't beat the original group. Sounds like just another fake band. The only legal group performing are called The Buck Ram Platters based out of Las Vegas.
2,"DON'T TAKE IT WITH YOU,","There are good maps of the subway system in all Metro stations, this map is so big unfolded that it's very inconvenient. You might use it at home to get familiar with what's what, but it's not useful when you're actually on the subway system. better to buy a Good Guide book like Dorling Kindersley Travel Guides: Barcelona and Catalonia, it has a metro map in it, and lists subway stops for major tourist sites. Subway maps are available online from the Official Barcelona metro authority. Download a nice 8x11 map that will fit in your pocket. Free."
1,Save your money,"For my recent trip to Europe I purchased this map and another for Prague after seeing the high praise for them. Was I disappointed! I was in Prague for four days and Barcelona three. These so called maps only confused me. I would not have purchased them if I had been able to preview them beforehand. Unless you already know the layout of the streets like the back of your hand, these maps will only serve to confuse. Many tourist kiosks sell much better maps with metro info and street layouts for less than a dollar. Again, unless you already know the city very well you would have to have another city map just to help you figure out Brein's map. After my miserable experience with these maps I can only say that the high praise I've seen for these maps is more than a little suspect. Calm down now, Polly, just changing your cage!"
2,"Outdated 1999 info, including Metro map","As with the Madrid guide and map, this product is way outdated--1999 publishing date. No way of knowing how much is crurrent without crosschecking other guides/sources."
2,Porch Swing,Swing looks good but is cheaply made. On arrival one of the back slats was broke. I guess you get what you pay for.
4,PRICED RIGHT,Seems like its a very nice swing for the price. Very easy to put together and the chains are very nice also. Super fast shipping.
2,Poor quality,"We had a good experience with quick delivery and quick pick-up with no return hassles. Unfortunately, the wood is not very thick which means swing is not very sturdy. One of the seat slats actually came loose easily when I pulled at it to test the strength of construction. Was concerned it would not hold our weight and returned it."
4,Great for DIY'ers,"I bought this for my GF's birthday. I would recommend giving it a nice quick light sanding and then painting or staining it how you would like. I made the mistake of assembling it first. The quality is a about what I would expect for the cost. I am satisfied with the purchase for the cost, it's definitely not a $100+ swing."
2,Broke the second time we sat on it,It sure looks nice-but the wood is so cheap.My 200lb hubby sat on it and the wood snapped in one corner-we willmost likely have the handyman try to reinforce it-It would be great if it was just for kids-
1,Cheaply made and not very good,This is a very light duty Poorly put together swing. It might work as a decorative item but as a usable swing it fails. I ended up returning this item as it was falling apart as it came out of the box. Amazon did give me a full refund but I would stay away from this item anyway.
3,Cheap,"I bought this 2 springs ago and have brought it out for its 3rd year. However don't let that give you the idea that its built to last. When I recieved the product set up was easy however the arms were VERY flimsy I had to get some wood screws to sturdy it up a bit. I then had to stain it to avoid it falling apart after the first rain. When I sat down on it its comfortable however if you have any weight to you, you may start questioning if you want to sit on it. I gave it 3 stars because its lasted longer than i expected but keep in mind I have taken it down during the ""off"" season. If you have no where to go with it you will have 1 or 2 seasons max out of this item."
3,Great price...,"This swing is perfect for the price. I used it to attach to an old swing frame. It is sturdy enough to hold 2 small children & hold up after being knocked down in a wind storm; however, I wouldn't trust it to hold an adult for any length of time."
2,Very Nice,"I ordered this to use while my Woodworker II is sharpened, and wow, it is a very very nice blade. I've been cutting some poplar and cherry today, and the cuts are just as smooth as the Woodworker's when it's sharp. I will probably keep using this blade even when my other blade is returned. Highly recommended.**EDIT**Yea so, the teeth started falling apart after only a few days use. I had no choice but to send it back. Very odd. It was really nice while it lasted, but now I'm scared to try another."
5,Great Blade!,I am pretty much a begginer at woodworking but have been at it for about 5 years now. I had always bought the cheap blades at home depot for my projects but I got this blade for Christmas and have to say it is amazing. It even runs quieter than my other blades. Everything they say about it is pretty much true. I just used it for finish capentry and I didn't need to sand the edges or anything. Of course I had to align the table and everything like the instructions say but it just cuts so smooth and quick.I will definitely buy more of these Freud coated blades.
3,outsidetime,This is a great blade for cross-cutting and angled cuts. puts an edge on the wood that you could shave with. If you want to rip with it then buy a different blade. it is Awful.
4,A good combo blade,"I was given an old craftsman tablesaw by my dad probably with the original blade. I replaced the fence and aligned everything but was still frustrated with the lack of power of the saw. Changing to this blade did make a dramatic difference. No, it didn't make the saw perform like a delta or jet tablesaw, but it did make my 1.5hp saw usable for a weekend garage woodworker."
3,Limited Therapeutic Benefit,"I'm not sure what Sigmund was thinking when he designed these blades but they seem to have limited therapeutic benefit. Its not that its not a awesome blade. Its the quality control. If you get a good one it will deliver good mental hygiene. If its a bad one you will rue the day you bought this blade. A good one -- smooth cuts, strong and straight. Lasts forever. A bad one will show itself really quickly. I've owned many of these and would put your odds at 10:1. 10 good to every 1 bad. Recommended --but good luck on the lottery."
3,Works good on chop saw,"this one gives a nice cut on my chop saw, but didn't work good on my old 10"" craftsman table saw"
4,Very Good Blade,"I bought a 10 inch Amana blade (number 610504) and had some problems with it. Please see my review under the Amana product. I sent it back and I purchased this Freud blade.The blade cuts well, very smooth, and I have experienced no kickback problems. The carbide tips are substantial and the blade itself is a heavy piece of metal. There is nothing flimsy about the product.I knocked off one star because I have not used the blade for very long. After I have used it for awhile I will try to remember to update the review. If you read this several months after September of 2012 I probably forgot to update the review; thus, little will have been found wanting in the blade. At that point consider this review to be five stars.AD2"
1,Burns Oak,"Bought this blade in September 2012. First time I tried it, it left dark burn marks while ripping oak. Put my old Lifetime blade back on and no burns. Both blades are the same design i.e. 50-tooth ATB Combination Blade. Tried it twice to make sure. Same results. New Freud LU84R011 burned the wood again while the old Lifetime blade left no marks. No way it could be the alignment or it would have burned using the old blade. Either the new Freud blade was defective or poor quality. Either way I'm looking for a different blade manufacture."
2,"Go with ""THE ALBUM""","The original Jive Bunny mixes are on a disc called ""THE ALBUM"", also available on amazon. The import discs have weird alternate versions of the samples in the medleys. I've been a DJ for 9 years, and after listening to the real Jive Bunny mixes, it's painful to listen to these substitutes. Go for ""THE ALBUM"", much better."
3,Kane and Durning carry sequel,"Carol Kane and Charles Durning reprise their roles from the original film, with Kane now a counselor who befriends a young stalking victim, and Durning is on the scene to protect his old friend. Film follows it's predecessor's format, with a great opening sequence that peters out before coming back to life with a scary finale. Interesting premise; our stalker is also a ventriloquist, and he can throw his voice so we're never quite sure where he is. Kane and Durning make a good team together and I'd welcome a third installment."
5,SCREAM is NOTHING compared to this truly creepy sleeper....,slip this one in the vcr or dvd player after dark and turn out the lights...ok folks you want a movie that will keep you up all night? THIS IS THE ONE!!!! you want a clever psychopath? THIS IS THE ONE!!!!you wanna get totally tripped out afraid of your own shadow? THIS IS THE ONE!!!! I REFUSE TO GIVE OUT ANY DETAILS>>>>except that youll see that now youll have to not only look under your bed at night before you go to sleep-youll have to have a full house inspection. SEE THIS FILM and you will know what i mean....
5,Awesome Blade!,"I purchased this blade to cut 3/4"" laminated MDF to make shelves. I wanted to use this material so that I didn't have to paint them. I was worried about chipping, so I bought this blade. Both sides of the laminate remained chip free on both rip and crosscuts. The cut lines were extremely smooth. The blade is whisper quiet too. I'm sold! I'm tossing my 40T blade that came with my saw and I'm purchasing the Freud 50T combo blade."
1,Product Failed,I received the Sony DCC-E345 DC adapor and put it to use to power a CD player in the car. Product initally worked for a short time then started to work intermittently after a couple of uses. After a couple of days teh product stopped working altogether. I would not purchase another DC adaptor from Sony.Sony DCC-E345 Car DC Adaptor with Selectable Voltage Switch
2,Read Passionate Marriage instead,"I had read sex-starved marriage prior and there was very little new information that I learned in this book. The author definitely takes a much more clinical approach than Sex Starved Marriage but in the end he is basically saying the same thing - increase desire through more physical arousal. It's not a bad ""introduction"" to the subject and it (along with Sex Starved Marriage) will help couples when the low-desire partner is motivated to work on the problem. This is rarely the case.It wasn't until, I read Dr. Schnarch's Passionate Marriage that I discovered the ""real"" dynamics at play in our relationship. Passionate Marriage has a completely different approach to it. If you could only buy one book, I would recommend Passionate Marriage instead."
4,Good to spark thoughtful conversation,"The McCarthy's book is helpful to get the conversation started about low-sex marriage. However, it requires two willing or somewhat willing partners. Throughout the book he recommends getting a sexual therapist involved which is helpful if you live in a mdetropolitan area with that sort of resource. Their exercises are somewhat helpful but are not a menu of step by step. It is more of a conceptual exercise on how to assess where you are at and what the next steps might be to make things better between you both.Recommended"
4,Rekindling Desire:A Step Program to Help Low-Sex and No-Sex,"I am a sex therapist with over 20 years of experience in the field. This is a book that I was eagerly awaiting and am using on a daily basis as an adjunct to my work with couples. It is clear, repetitive enough to ""make the point,"" and gives couples clear steps that they can read and evaluate on their own, as well as in the therapy sessions. I fell very positive about recommending this book."
4,Useful advice,This book gives practical advice for happily married couples who need to spice up their sex life. I liked this book because it focuses on sex-related issues rather than fixing troubled marriages.
5,Will Order From Again,The product was in excellent shape and was delivered and packed in great time and in great condition.
1,...,"I read both this book and its carbon copy, The Sex-Starved Marriage by Michele Weiner-Davis, hoping to find some help for my own low-/no-sex marriage, and found absolutely none at all. They did not even begin to address my situation. They deal strictly with sexual techniques and completely avoid the deeper relational and emotional issues that drive couples, like me and my wife, apart. I would not recommend these books to anyone."
5,Excellent book,This is an excellent book to help understand how to resolve no-sex or low-sex relationships. It also provides very good insights into how each person in the relationship thinks about the situation and the internal effects it has on them.
1,Worse than useless,"All the theory in this book is dead wrong. There is little by way of practical advice. The book is mainly a collection of amateurish paintings by Ms. Van Wyk that are supposed to illustrate how to use various tubed colors. You should aspire to paint much better than Van Wyk ever did.To date, there appears to be no good book on mixing color. Instead, see www.handprint.com. It's about watercolor, but the color theory and mixing sections apply equally to oil paint. Also give a look to www.wetcanvas.com"
1,Not Super Useful,"I wouldn't call this a bad book, but as a self-taught painter, I didn't find that it added any value to my studies. It discusses basic colors, one color at a time. So one chapter will be on Burnt Sienna, which is great if you're painting an entire painting in Burnt Sienna. If the book were more unified, i.e. it went through all the colors individually, then showed you how they work in tandem to create a painting, it would be much more useful."
3,Corey's Rhythm and Blues,"Corey Hart is known by mid 80s hits such as NEVER SURRENDER and CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU. His sixth album in 1992 may be hard to come by mainly because it was not well promoted back then. It is purely a rhythm and blues album a bit different from 80s pop style and I feel as if I were listening to Paul Young titles.Third track BABY WHEN I CALL YOUR NAME is an outstanding slow ballad track reminding me a bit of Paul Young's EVERY TIME I GO AWAY. 92 DAYS OF RAIN, however, is the reason why Cory's fans should still stick to this one. It is indeed typical 80s Cory style and my top favorite from this album. WITHOUT YOUR LOVE is a moody yet touching ballad also my favorite. SONNET FROM THE PORTUGUESE is something like STING's ENGLISHMAN IN NEW YORK.Verdict: Cory tries blues. A nice album for a change.Rating: 75 out of 100Recommended for: Cory Hart, and some of Paul Young and Hall and Oates fans."
3,"Not bad, but not his best either","In the mid-80s, Corey Hart was a handsome young pop-rocker with a distinctive, emotional and highly melodic style belying his punkish, spiky-haired appearance. He had big hits with songs like ""Sunglasses At Night,"" ""Never Surrender,"" and ""Eurasian Eyes."" When he made this album in 1992, his distinctive voice was still well-intact, but the overall robustness of his signature sound was starting to wear thin. A few selections, such as ""92 Days Of Rain,"" ""Always,"" and ""Poster"" stay true to the roots of the above mentioned hits from the 80s, but as a whole, this album is more tired and less fresh-sounding than some of his earlier efforts."
4,"""Of Great Attitude & Virtue"".","This is a great album by this talented canadian underrated artist. Interestingly, compositions & singing style are different as compared to ""First Offence"" or the more famous and most successful,""Boy In The Box"" albums. Despite this change, he manages to pull it off magnificiently with hits, ""Baby When I Call Your Name"", ""She's Everywhere"" , ""Always"", ""Poster"" & ""Without Your Love"". This certainly proves his versatility as singer-songwriter who is good at that! A highly recommeded listening."
5,Very Cool,"Now, this album is not better than the original 2 however it IS a must for real Nilsson fans. This C.D is definitly a supplement to any Nilsson fans'collection. Sometimes I want to hear Pandemonium Shadow by its self there were songs on that C.D that aren't included on this C.D like ""Ten little indians"",""She sang hymes out of tune,"" and ""There will never be."" However sometimes I like hearing the alternative versions on this C.D. ""Walk right back"" is definitly awesome. I truly don't think Nilssons' nod to Phil Spector (River deep-moutain high) ever goes out of style. Nilssons songwritting always reminded me of songwritting by Jimmy Webb. They (to me) always had alot in common as far as their songs' tones go."
5,i only love her songs!!,i can't say something more than she is butty woman i love this song very much but also i love (look at me)and (mi chico latino)singls i wish if her still sing with the spice girls and also solo! if anybody read this go and bye all geri's cd's and have a fun! (calling) is romance song and keek you relax i bye all geri cd's and i think that she have something make any person love her and i want to say we love you in the arab world and i'm from (Dubai) i wish to her a nice life.
3,The wife loves it.,"What more can I say, the wife wanted it for her birthday and that's what she got, it was easy to assemble, just like it says in the instructions. It's been on for a few months now and everything seem to be just fine."
2,Hampered by Windows CE,"This unit has some great features and ergonomics, but Whistler's choice of OS makes this unit annoyingly unreliable. Having to completely exit the GPS program before shutting down the system is a huge pain in the rear."
1,Junk!,"This GPS is complete junk. Mine had repeated software problems after just 4 months of use. I had to reload the maps twice and it finally crashed for good. Customer service was no help - telling me to reload the maps both times only masked the issues. It's cheap, overpriced junk. Mine ended up crashing totally and is unusable. '''''For $260 i expected better and I suspect the company knows it's pedalling chinese junk at western-made prices because they stopped returning my e-mails after I told them it broke again. Don't buy it unless you like $260 paper weights. Junk Junk Junk Junk Junk."
3,Whistler WGPX-550 GPS,"This is my first GPS system. My first impressions were great. Easy setup, easy to figure out how to use it without even using the PDF manual. I like how it quickly recalculates a route if you miss a turn. I really only have one complaint, but it is major. The maps are so out of date that even major roads that have been in for 3 to 5 years and in at least one case 20 years are missing from the map completely! I have emailed Whistler on this but have not recieved any comments back as of yet (only 1 day). On my very first use of the GPS it told be to Turn on to two different dead-end roads to get home. I understand that this is not a fault of the unit or software itself, its just that the maps are OBSOLETE. If there is a way to update them to where say, Mapquest or Google maps has their maps I would be completely satisfied with the unit.I expect that using it on major highways or freeways would work flawlessly.Regards, Dave C"
4,"easy to start, easy to use!","as a women i was looking for a tiller, that was easy to startand as my soil has lots of clay, it had to be tough. the ryobi is everything i was looking for and then some. it's light weight and easy to use, which is a big plus with me."
1,Ryobi - Junk,"I purchased this machine from Amazon, used it for an hour, doing a great job. Then I stopped only long enough to refuel, tried to restart, could not get the rope to pull out of the machine.My first thought was excessive fuel was creating a lock, so I removed the spark plug, no help. Called Ryobi Customer service suggested I take the machine to a Warranty center to repair or return to Amazon, but would not allow to be returned to manufacture. I took it to a authorized repair center, unit was there over one week. Today I went to the repair center thinking my machine has been repaired. It was not, but the technician told me the gears are defective. Technician has left several messages with Ryobi to get authorization to repair, but get no return calls from Ryobi. Also Amazon states that gas powered products are not returnable. Buyers beware of Royobi and Amazons policy."
2,Ryobi Cultivator,this is a nice machine until the wheels stick in the mud. the wheel assembly is way to small and flimsy for this type of machine. a bad design in My eyes.
4,Brilliant!,"An impressive album, which will amaze anyone who has never seen Kenny White live, and live up to the memories of anyone who has. Like many of the great singer-songwriters, Mr. White defies easy classification, moving at will between cool jazz, intricate folk, and classic rock styles. Do not miss this album!"
4,Info on the VHS version,You might want to know that the out of print VHS (I happen to own one) is recorded at LP speed instead of SP. It has a mono soundtrack & is not recorded in VHS HiFi. Also it's pan & scan instead of widescreen like the DVD. You want widescreen? Then go get the DVD. Otherwise save a few bucks (if you have a VHS machine or a DVD/VHS combo) and get the tape.The movie is still very enjoyable even in this version....
3,"Better transfer than the ""Terminal Pack"" transfer","As hard as it may be to believe, this being a ""Good Times"" release, the transfer on this DVD is better than that included in the ""Terminal Pack"". Yes, the ""Terminal Pack"" transfer is anamorphic, and this one has SLIGHTLY more grain....but this transfer is in the correct proportion. Tires are round and the actors don't look like stick people.My recommendation...buy this disk to supplement your ""Terminal Pack""."
3,"The best of all the ""Airport"" sequels!","In my mind this sequel should have been the only one done after the success of the original.The script utilizes what material was not used from Authur Haley's novel in the first film and expands on it.The film is quite suspenseful but slightly dated. It features some hair raising moments when a pilot is attempted to be transferred to the pilotless plane.All in all, it's the best of all the ""Airport"" sequels!"
3,Disaster Indeed!,"Everything that Charlton Heston appears in annoys me to no end. Only because of Karen Black could I give this as many 'stars'. A disaster flic that more resembles a comedy, Airport '75 is yet another in a long line of disaster films beset with poor screenplay and lack of imagination. Yet, it mananged to hold my interest. Heston's usual over-acting, dull cliches liberarly used throughout, unbelievable story - all combine to make this a mediocre film that might have been good in another time and place. Check it out if you have a couple of hours to kill and nothing else to do."
2,Airport 75 Lost Power,"Airport 75 lost speed because the plot is only as good as a car wreck. You wrecked and now go home. Kare Black tries to fly a Boeing 747-100 on her own with a gash in the cockpit blowing winds up to 500 mph (yet her hair is almost still!). Charleton Heston makes his way into the plane via hole in the cockpit. Plane saved and lands on 3 engines and one engine takes out a shack on landing. The inflight movie was ""American Graffiti."""
2,A comic treat,"AIRPORT 1975 is a must-see for the disaster connoisseur, although mostly for the comic value of the terrible script and the mummified performances. Strictly speaking, it's not as amusing as AIRPORT 77 and not as terrible as the relishable AIRPORT 80 - THE CONCORDE. But, the last half hour is silly enough to make the likes of AIRPLANE completely redundant. By the way, Heston fans can look forward to him wearing shades and saying ""Bay-bee"" a lot."
4,Gloria Swanson's final film,"I saw this movie first run in 1974 and never get tired of watching it. Karen Black is amazing and very believable as the stewardess that is left to fly the plane. It is rare in disaster films to see such a strong female character that is not nasty or demanding. She really carries the film. Charlton Heston, plays his normal stoic self. The disaster itself and the photpgraphy is very good. Most of the all star cast are passengers; Gloria Swanson looks fabulous in her last film. She's very classy playing herself, Susan Clark, Linda Blair, Sid Caesar, Augusta Summerland (who was Heston's co-star in Planet of the Apes billed as Linda Harrison), Nancy Olson (Miss Swanson co star in Sunset Blvd), Martha Scott, Myrna Loy and Helen Reddy. Also stars George Kennedy (who starred in all 4 Airport films), Dana Andrews, Beverly Garland, Roy Thinnes and Erik Estrada. It is ashame they do not make films with such stellar casts any more."
1,Good Times Home Video ruins another DVD in Airport 1975.,"I purchased Airport 1975 because this is an enjoyable film with a high tension rescue and excellant special effects. The sound isn't close to the usual DVD/CD quality. The picture shimmers throughout the movie which is very distracting. The DVD doesn't look sychronized and the hesitations and shimmers throughout the film spoiled the picture for me. DVDs are advertised as the best way to see and hear a picture. I would agree with that statement, but not Airport 1975. This is the second DVD I purchased through amazon.com by Good Times Home Video. I have felt cheated by both purchases and couldn't even watch the other DVD due to its poor quality and sound. I will never purchase another DVD or Video from Good Times and will be sure to check the technical information to determine which company put out the DVD and the customers who watched its comments. I would suggest that the readers of my comments do likewise."
3,Decent Sequel To The 1970 Megahit,"Charlton Heston does his best here, in the 1974 sequel to the original blockbuster ""Airport"". Good visual effects are on hand this time (beating out the 1970 Airport effects by a large margin), with lots of excellent aerial footage of the stricken Boeing 747-100 aircraft in flight, after a collision with a small prop plane. But this version lacks the crisp, witty dialogue so prevalent in the first Airport flick. Still, this one is worth taking a look at. My rating would actually be 3-and-a-half stars."
4,Airport 1975:,"Airport 1975: I do enjoy the acting in the movie but the 'Plane' is the Star! However, I was disappointed that the video is in the LP mode and not SP; from my experience, LP recordings break quickly, and are slightly fuzzy.The seller was prompt and courteous."
1,Nearly useless.,"This is probably the worst book I have read on C++ to date. The author does not clearly explain the details of the C++ language or how to implement them. Contrary to some of the other comments, I believe this book is NOT a good choice for someone learning data structures and algorithms for the first time."
1,Nice cut and paste job!,The author has done a fine job of replacing every instance of the word Java with C++. Keep up the mediocre work!
4,Great C++ refresher for professionals,"Although I did not read much of the content about data structures, I can say that the other half of the book is great for those in the field that have studied these topics previously.The concise lists of C++ gotchas are worth the price alone. Many of the topics from the Meyers' 'Effective C++' series are touched on (much more briefly) here. There's also a short chapter that very briefly highlights some major design patterns. I was pleasantly surprised to even find descriptions of pointer arithmetic efficiency in an appendix! This book really had exactly the scope I was looking for while job hunting; it's broad and concise.I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because it might be too difficult for someone just starting out to follow and because its STL coverage is a little out of date and thin."
3,Lots of interesting topics but poor explanation,"This book was required for a data structures and algorithms class. At first it seemed interesting. By looking at the table of contents, lots of topics were covered. But the problem is that each chapter lacks a good introduction context or example. That is, when you dont know anything about hash tables or binary trees, this book starts by telling you what are the rules and types of binary trees or hash tables, but does not tell you really why they exist or how can it be useful in the first place. But the most frustrating part is the examples after each chapter that does include any answers, it is nearly useless.Please excuse me for my poor english, it is not my primary languange."
1,Makes a Nice Coaster,"i really wanted to give this book a good review since i actually paid for it. unfortunately, the author doesn't provide enough explantion to go with the theory, proofs, or code fragments included within. the problems and projects at the end of each chapter come from left field, and leave you wondering if you missed something along the way. the introduction to algorithm analysis and Big Oh notation is quite terrible, and i would suggest using a discrete structures book as a supplement. the code fragments are tight and sparse, which adds complexity to an already complex set of algorithms. if you can find this book used, purchase it used. save your money for a book that goes into more detail regarding algorithm design and analysis, as opposed to the idiosyncrasies of the language. too many assumptions are made on behalf of the author. maybe programmers shouldn't write books on programming..."
3,"""NOT AS GOOD---THATS FOR CERTAIN!!!","This it the first Prey book I have nearly put down before I finsihed it. I have read them all in order and really liked all of them until this one. The character of Carmel Loan is so unbelieveable it is unreal, in my openion. She is an Attorney and then all of a sudden a killer who enjoys it. No way, happended to quick. From nothing to a professional in an instant. Lucus is his usual self, a good character, I missed the Nun and Del. Sloan and Franklin did not have as big a part. The ending leaves me to believe we are not through with the killer. If this is your first Prey book, please read another one as any of them will be better."
3,"""Fair to Good"" at Best","While Certain Prey is a fast read, the story is too farfetched to be believable and the characters are not well-developed and are somewhat cartoonish. Given you know the killer(s) early on, there is not as much suspense as I've come to expect from John Sandford, especially from the early Prey books in the series. I'm afraid that Sandford is running out of credible plots and interesting, believable villains, and it might be time for Sandford to consider retiring Lucas Davenport. While I'm not ready to give up on this series, I'm going to need to see a lot of positive reader support before I buy another Sandford book. Bottom line is that Certain Prey is a book that holds your attention but does not live up to expectations."
3,"Not the best in the series, but still a good summer read.","What's Lucas' problem with women?! First he loses Weather (a wonderful character), and now he's finished with Sherrill (although she obviously isn't finished with him). Ironically, this book features two strong female characters, Rinker the Hit Woman and Carmel Loan, one the coldest women on the planet. In fact, Lucas becomes a minor character in this story. The banal conversation between Carmel and Clara is right on in it's own way. These two discuss murder as easily as they do the latest fashions! The lack of suspense with bother some long-time Prey fans, but Sandford can still spin a story, and his police characters (and ""Feebies"") are well-written and engaging. Let's just hope Lucas gets his love life sorted out and gets back to solving some serious crimes."
1,Unconvincing,"This plot was shallow, far-fetched and there was not one character in the book to root for. But there were horrific murders with no motives, poor character development, and corny, (no, not corny, but stupid) dialogue."
3,"Not the best, but still a good read","Again, I wait and I wait and at last it arrives. A whole year has to pass before the new Sanford is out. I get it and read it overnight because my friends are all waiting.This one is okay, and parts of it are excellent, but there is something missing. Perhaps as others have written it's the fact that Lucas ought to have an excellent sex life and be able to get and keep a woman, but that doesn't seem to be happening. Perhaps it is because I couldn't wait for the movie treatment to be released and it was definitely a disappointment. Eric LaSalle is no Lucas Davenport, although he is a fine actor.I will wait for the year it takes for the next Prey to be released and hope that whatever it is that is missing from this one is back in the next entry."
3,Just okay,"This entry in the Lucas Davenport series starts out great, with a professional hit-woman coming to town. And, for the first half of the book, the pro killer and the crazy lawyer who hired her make a good pair. By midway, the story has collapsed in on itself a bit, and becomes plodding. It tries, but never quite pulls itself out of the slump.There aren't any real pieces of character development, in terms of the main characters, in this book, and that felt out of place. If the author had replaced Lucas and Co. with another set of generic characters, this one would have worked quite well as a stand-alone."
4,A worthwhile read,"This was the first book I had read by Sandford, and I clearly enjoyed it. The plot was a bit cheesy, and he took some liberties to develop the plot, but it was interesting, enjoyable, and captivating. What I liked most was the fact that the main detective does not come off as the superhero who can do everything beyond the powers of mere mortal detectives, but is rather a good officer, facing tough challenges, who does a good job. He even succumbs on one occasion to violating the law to catch his suspect, rather than let her go. The book forces you to pay attention, due to the great amount of detail which becomes critical, so if you are looking for a book that you can half-heartedly read and enjoy, without paying much attention, this may not be your book. If you want to take your time, enjoy the book, and think about the developing facts, you hit the right one. I look forward to picking up another from this author."
2,Disappointing! Davenport deserves better!,"As a John Sandford fan, I found this book to be a little thin on plot, thinner on character development, and clearly an effort that John Sandford ""mailed in."" The other books in the series crackled with tension, suspense and excitment -- Certain Prey certainly fizzled. Clara Rinker and Carmel Loan could have been electric, much like Becker and Carlos (?) in two of the other Prey books (titles escape me at the moment!), but the desire wasn't there on the part the author -- although I hope Clara will be back for another go 'round with Lucas. It would be nice to flesh out her character a little more. But I'll wait for paperback for that one -- Certain Prey has cured me of buying hardcovers! Overall, this book was almost as disappointing as the casting of Eriq LaSalle as Davenport in the TV movie."
5,Just as engaging as the other 'Prey' novels.,"Davenport is a little older, and a tad more laid back in the latest entry to the 'Prey' series, but he's no less entertaining. Sandford creates two new and intriguing villians in Carmen and Clara that will keep you laughing and in utter shock all at the same time. There is more dialogue and detailed character description of the villains than I remember in previous 'Prey' books, and that really added to the overall flavor of the novel. I found myself feeling almost, and I do mean almost, sympathetic to Clara. Carmen, however, is the epitome of evil. Although Lucas has aged and evolved over the course of the Prey novels, he is his same old self hunting these women down. If you enjoyed the previous 'Prey' books, you'll love this one too."
4,My First Prey,"This was my first John Sandford book and I really enjoyed it alot. I will buy more of his books. If you put aside the fact that the main character is a ""erotic dancer"" gone ""hired killer"" then you will do just fine. I had a tiny problem with that BUT all in all I couldnt put the book down and really enjoyed all the characters and will read some more soon!"
3,Actually 3+ stars,"This was a 3+ star book. The villians were different than the typical crime novel which made them more intreesting than usual. The book had a Pulp Fiction feeling. It as a fast read, good mindless entertainment."
3,"decent story, too much of not enough","the book starts out fast, with good characters and story but deteriorates into a maybe, what if, how did she do it, hit the nail on the head every time I guess on a clue unthriller. It beats some other summer reading but definately not his best. Reads fast like all his novels."
5,"Best ""prey"" book EVER","I like John Sandford. Some of his books were ok, some good, but this one was great! I loved the women characters in the book. Don't miss this one if you like the Prey series."
2,What happened?,"I call this review ""what happened?"", because let's be honest, is John Sanford getting tired or just figures he can put anything into a book and sell it? Well the last is certainly true, but I found myself very much into this book until the part where the husband of the woman who was ""hit"" decides to go and pay a visit to Davenport as though they were old buddies and then proceeds to tell him things no one in their right mind would and this after Davenport tries to have him tried for murder! And from this Davenport figures out the whole thing. Talk about straining our disbelief...Helloooo...John you reading this? There are better plot devices than this. From that point on, I read because I had bought the book and no other reason. Not a good attempt John, do better."
2,Didn't Live Up To Expectations,"I have enjoyed all the previous Prey books, so I readily bought into all the hype surrounding this one. I was looking forward to a suspenseful page turner. A book I could lose myself in. It didn't live up to my expectations. A farfetched plot without Sanford's usual spark. The character, Clara Rinker, was a good one but not strong enough to carry the story. I had the impression that Sanford came up with the Rinker character and tried to build a story around her. It didn't work."
3,"surprisingly, a mediocre outing from sanford","I agree with several of the reviewers that this was not his best and I judge it to be mediocre at the best, which is disappointing, in that so many of his books have been excellent. This book, with a transparent attorney, a likeable hitperson (hooker with a heart of gold comes to mind), was almost predictable from the beginning. I hope Mr sanford/camp will re-examine his works in future and not follow ludlum/patterson and several others into the halls of mediocrity."
1,Do not buy used library audio books!,The audio book I purchased was unusable. It skipped at least 4 units on every disc. Very disappointing and I learned a great lesson.
1,Not for me,This book was filled with offensive language. It was much too intense and graphic for my taste. I found the story line to be disturbing.
2,"Not good, not good at all","After I read the phenomenal global war novel, The Triumph and the Glory, Sandford's Certain Prey came off as feeble indeed. I found his earlier books terrific, but this new one just fell flat. Maybe Triumph was a tough act to follow, but I don't think that's the real reason, I think the real reason is that Certain Prey lacks pace, lacks effective characterization, lacks a believable plot, and lacks a good beginning, middle, and ending."
3,Was this novel written by a ghostwriter? Give me Lucas..,I have read every Prey novel and I was disappointed in Certain Prey. Sandford has been so successful with the Prey series because he developed Davenport throughout the years into a believable human being even surrounded with serial killers. This book was about Clara and Carmel with a little of Lucas thrown in to classify as a Prey book. I would have enjoyed the book if it had been classified with a cameo appearance by Lucas Davenport. It is too bad that the software company and his friends including the nun were only briefly mentioned in Certain Prey. She was an anchor of goodness that kept him human. The Prey series has been a great run for Sandford and I hope that he is not tapped out.
3,OK,"The Triumph and the Glory was better, so was Havana Bay and The Eleventh Commandment. I agree with the earlier reviewer who thought the earlier books were also all better than Certain Prey. Sandford just seemed to be going through the motions on this one."
3,I expect more from this series!,"For Lucas Davenport fans, I don't think this one will do. We have little or no details about his life, his relationship with Marcy Sherrill is off but we're not sure why, and we haven't even gotten over the breakup with Weather yet! The story is pretty silly, and countless individuals are wasted unnecessarily, including an innocent bystander at the end while Lucas is chasing down the ""villain"" - a female lawyer he previously was attracted to. There is only a glimmer of the great dialogue and fooling around among Lucas' co-workers and staff, although the FBI duo are a bit interesting. The only character gem is Rinker, and I'll admit she's engaging, but it's hard to really enjoy someone who tortures folks for a living. We want more of Lucas, though, and less silliness. PLEASE!"
2,Certain Prey is a disappoint to Lucas Davenport fans.,"I was so looking forward to this latest in the Prey series. Unfortunately, Certain Prey isn't up to the standards of the others in the series. Sandford's villains usually give me the creeps and I root for Davenport and his cronies to get the bad guys. I disliked Carmel Loan from the git go. Disliked her to the point that I was bored spending time with her. I didn't care if Davenport caught her. I just wanted her gone. The other hit lady, Clara Rinker, was plain dull. I was disappointed in this novel."
2,Too confusing,"I didnt like this book so much. I use to love Davenport and in this book he was a blah character. The characters I just couldnt get into, they were ""choppy"" at best. This was not one of his greatest works. I love the Prey series but maybe Mr. Sanford is getting tired of it!"
4,Hooked,This is the first book I have read by John Sandford and now I wish I hadn't because of the money I am going to spend buying the rest of his books.
2,John...John...What happened?????,"A big...even huge...fan of the Prey books, I was so disappoined in this one that I didn't even finish it. About three-quarters of the way into it I realized that the two women protagonists were so one-dimensional and uninteresting that I just did not care whether Lucas caught them or not! It seems that all the typical Sandford police department banter and wit was missing from this book, and Lucas was as bland and boring as when what's his name from ER played him recently in a forgettable Prey movie on HBO or one of those networks. Come on John! I know you can do better than this! I think you need to sit down with your very first Prey book (since the one right before Certain Prey was awful too)and read it. Maybe then you will be able to make the comparison. Let's get Lucas back to his borderline psycho state and let's get some real nasty bad guys! It's tough to finish a book when there's no one to root for or care about or really hate!"
3,B Minus...C Plus range.,"With a complete suspension of disbelief this can be a pretty fun read. Give the author a lot of latitude in credulity department and enjoy. The two villainesses are almost cartoonish and stretch the imagination.This was my first ""Prey"" series read and I will take the advice of an earlier reviewer and read the initial entry. I liked Lucas Davenport and would like to fill in the blanks on him.The first hundred pages flew by and then it sputtered and sped up a couple of times. There was some great cop dialog and some interesting characters on Davenport's side of the law. Interesting twist on the cat and mouse genre.It's fun, but not too likely."
3,"Not as good as his earlier ""Prey"" books","I have read every single entry in Sandford's Prey series and this one wasn't quite up to par. His first few books were filled with menace and I thought his villains were outstanding. During that time he developed Davenport as the excellent character that he is now. However, this latest book bothered me. I liked Rinker, an unusual hit'man', but found Carmel totally over the top. Her actions, given her successful background as a top, hard-nosed defense attorney were inexplicable and made no sense. It was as though someone had done a brain transplant on her at the beginning of the book. I don't usually write reviews on books that I think are only average, but when it represents what I regard as a decline, I think it is noteworthy."
3,Davenport is losing his edge,"While I enjoyed the first few 'Prey' books a lot, I have felt that subsequent books suffered, among other things due to the change in status of Lucas Davenport. When first introduced in the series he was an iconoclastic cop who read poetry and, occasionally, took the law into his own hands. As the series has progressed, he has moved up in the police department hierarchy, become a millionare through his outside software business and generally lost the hungry edge that made the character work. I miss that guy and don't much care for the rich and self centered persona that the books present now. Time for a new hero or a dramatic change of fortune for Davenport to bring him back to human perspective."
3,My favorite author,"I have enjoyed reading the 'Prey' books, my favorite being Silent Prey. 'Certain Prey' didn't hold my interest for many chapters. I felt there was too much profanity in the book but I did complete the book, though. I enjoy reading of Mpls. as I can identify with the names of the streets, etc. John Sandford, keep up the good work but keep Lucas Davenport in your theme as your character. You are a good author & my favorite! Signed: a devoted book fan."
1,Murder novel? More like bored to death!!,"I have read every Prey novel and this one was such a let down. Not enough Lucas Davenport, to much Thelma and Louise. Where was our tough guy Lucas? The one who is sensual, intriguing and smart? Instead all the reader gets is the very boring story of a women who has been treated badly by men who then turns to a murder for hire career. Give me a break!!! A real yawn fest!!! The only humor was the fact that the hit woman teams up with a lady lawyer--to much!! If you have yard work to do that you hate or a chance to read this book----- get out the mower!!!"
2,Phoned In,"Davenport is one of the better lead characters alive in the genre today, but the reader can't help yawning most of the way through Certain Prey. The writing almost sounds as if Sanford has lost his way and his will just as Davenport has on the pages of this series.In this genre the reader has to be prepared to suspend disbelief from time to time. This novel, however, requires far too many lapses of reason. Characters act out of character. Much of the scenery is black and white. And, Davenport goes way outside the lines of the law, which is a luxury a private detective has, but a public one does not. Too much to overlook.If you've never read a Lucas Davenport novel, don't start here. If you're a Lucas Davenport fan read this book, but be warned that this is far from the best we've seen in this series."
4,A book review,"A priori it looks to be entertaining. Unfortunately I have yet to find time to read it due to work schedule; however, I'm looking forward to doing so over the Christmas period."
2,Disappointing--lacks believability we expect from Sanford,"This new Prey book seems shallow and not well-thought out as if Sanford were under pressure to make it to the market. Accustomed as we are to his usually on-the-money characters, this book is peopled with characters that don't fit their own profiles. A successful lawyer that doesn't manifest any psychopathic behavior prior to becoming an out-of control serial killer?? A shrewd, career criminal who compromises all her own self-preservation standards?? Sanford needs to retake Psych 101."
4,Lovers and snipers,"This Lucas Davenport novel is one of the better ones. Well, they are all great, but the main-characters apart from Lucas Davemport and his team, are criminal women. And they are as hardcore as the male villains and serial killers we have met in other Davenport novels. Carmel is a high profile lawyer falling in love with a married man. As Carmel is used to get whatever she wants, and also is a sociopath, she is quick to put a contract out on the man's wife. She is recommended the female hit-woman Carla. Carla quickly takes out the wife, and Carmel can start her affair with the widowed man. But pretty soon things start to go wrong, and Carla is forced to bond with Carmel, and from then on, one killing takes another. Not only is Lucas Davenport on the look-out for them, the FBI is also trying to find them, and the book is a pageturner, an exciting and quick and satisfying read."
4,"A ""Killer"" novel!","This is the first John Sandford book I have read, actually listened to on audiobook, and was surprised to find that I really enjoyed it and will look for the other books in the prey series. I'm not usually a fan of the ""murder, mystery, cop"" genre, but this was very entertaining. The two women in the story, one a professional hitwoman and the other a lawyer, meet as the result of the lawyer wanting the wife of her ""boyfriend"" out of the way. Things don't go quite as planned, and the two end up killing anyone that threatens to expose them. Along the way they get to be good friends, and neither seems to have any qualms about killing people. The lawyer, Carmel, even finds it satisfying and commits a few murders of her own. (The knee-drilling scenes were very graphic...ouch!!!!) Surprisingly, the reader starts to root for them, at least I did. The police detective manages to right on their tails which makes for a great, fast paced story."
4,A Great Read,"I've read most of Sandford's books, and I think they continually get better. The most recent book, CERTAIN PREY, was immensely satisfying for me to read. I enjoyed the suspense, the direction of the plot, and the characters. Sandford gives you a feeling of familiarity to all the characters and you feel what they are feeling. I liked the way the book led up to a climax and loved the way it ended. It was deep and enthralling. The finale left me thinking. It was a great read!"
1,ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT FROM SANDFORD,"As a big Prey fan who was extremely disappointed with Sandford's last novel (Sudden Prey), I held hope that this would be more along the lines of his earlier novels. No such luck. Boring, boring, boring are the three words I would use to describe this book. The only reason I finished it at all was because I was on a trip and it's the only book I had!! Don't waste your time...read one of the earlier ones instead!!"
1,Who likes brutality?,I'll be brief. This is the most brutal book I have ever read. I guess I'm not into brutality and torture. I quite reading at about page 150 because I'd had enough. I didn't really care if the two psychopaths described got caught or not. I don't see any reason for books like this in a country that should be interested in psychological improvement.
1,disappointed sandford fan,"I only recently began reading John Sandford's ""Prey"" novels and was addicted until i read this one. I wouldn't go so far as to say I would not read any of his new works, however, this one was almost a waste of my time. I found the characters very difficult to relate to-I never felt I knew them, as I have with past books. Lucas did not seem to be the same person, the person I had come to expect. While reading the other books in the series, I found it extremely difficult to put them down; this one was difficult to finish."
2,Not up to first Prey novels.,"I liked Lucas better when he was with Weather. He showed more depth of character. I felt sorry for Sherrill who still had feeling for him. His killers are getting very BORING! Bring back the psychos please. I enjoy when Lucas is stalking his prey and delving into their minds. Eyes Of Prey and Winter Prey, now that's a true Sanford experience. What a disappointment!"
5,Spellbinding,It has been awhile since a book has held my attention as this one did.I hiaghly reccommend it to anyone who likes a very bleveable thriller.
2,Disturbing,"I have read and enjoyed several of John Sandford's books and was looking for another enjoyable experience with Certain Prey. I didn't get it. The hit woman and the murderously jealous psychopath who hired her were painted in such a light that I found myself sympathizing with them. I find this disturbing. I would have given it zero stars if I had tossed it out after the first couple of chapters. However, as with all of Sandford's books, it was intriguing and kept me reading to the last page."
5,Great book...John has another winner,I love the Prey series! This was a great book with Davenport playing his usual sneeky self. Rinker is a great character as a women hit person she is amazing! Loan plays a great psychotic killer-wanna be. Very easy read...literally couldn't put it down!
5,Life saver!,"I have arthritis in my hip and am awaiting total hip replacement. In the meantime, I can't bend ... if I drop something on the floor it stays there until my husband returns home from the office (so something can be on the floor for up to 12 hours). The ""reacher"" is a wonderful help. I can not only pick up dropped items, but can retrieve the mail which is dropped thru a slot in my front door, and I can even get pots and pans out of the lower cupboard. I also use it to get food from the lower shelves of the refrigerator. Best of all, I can now feed my 3 cats by putting the food on the plates and then lowering to the floor using the reacher. I'm delighted!Connie"
5,Great Helper,"I have wrist, shoulder, and back problems. The EZ Reacher has been a great help to me, especially when I drop things."
4,"I'm 5'3"" . . .","I'm 5'3"". This EZ Reacher is too long for me! 24"" would be better for me personally.It picks up well. In that regard it delivers. I gave it to my 91 year old father. Heis 5'10"". His arms are longer to get whatever is in the grasp of the Reacher. He caneasily pick up the mail that is on the floor after being delivered through the slotin his door. It helps him, so it is worth the purchase."
3,"32"" EZ Reacher","32"" EZ Reacher - LockingI bought it because a reviewer touted it as the best on the market. It does a fine job BUT if dropped on the floor the casings seperate and do not fasten back together tightly. I bought it because I am on crutches and not allowed to bend. I have two other brands of ""reachers"" and they all fall down at least once a day. This is the only variety that had case-seperation-issues. It is well designed for tough reaches. The wrist support is helpful for large cans. It can also do light work. It ""broke"" the day I received it and put it in service. Time will tell if the casings hold together well enough for it to continue to be functional. Feature rich, but not so durable. Best for heavy jobs, but does light work as well."
4,Great Sound Great Price,"This unit is beautiful and really has the sound definition I require from a system. The two-way (my preferred speaker) speakers are crisp and have a punchy bass. I've owned an earlier version of this same unit for 3 years without a hitch. Only drawback: the opening for the CD and the Cassette are a little plastic-y. Of course they are plastic, but my other Aiwa unit has more metal on the face of the unit and feels more substantial.JMc-"
3,A little more editing,Janelle Denison always puts out a good romance. I loved the tension and chemistry between Paige and Josh. My only complaint is all the typos in the kindle edition. It was enough typos to take away from the story at times.
2,92 Pages?,"And that is not counting the blanks before each chapter beginning. I bought my copy from an Amazon reseller for considerably less than the $35 hardback sticker price. A somewhat charming diversion, not up to her best work. Would have been better if she had posted it on line for her her fans gratis or as a one or two dollar Kindle download. Three stars on content downgraded to two for ridiculous price."
3,Cute Story!,"It is a little short but I always like Connie Willis. I agree that it does not have the complexity of her other books and that it is a little short. Other than that, it is a good, quick read."
4,Beware spoiler!,"Being an H.L. Mencken fan, I loved this novella by Connie Willis. The premise is simple, Mencken, long dead, seems to ""channel"" himself into individuals with views abhorrent to him. Then, he uses these individuals to spout classic Mencken views in public forums, surprising all attendees and, most of all, the person he uses to channel himself. The only hitch is by using this technique, Mencken is proving channeling to be authentic, an activity that he debunks as fraudulent. A real dilemma!"
4,In typical Willis style,"Another lovely novella by the queen of modern science fiction. It was such a quick, fun little read, very much in her regular style. She gets a little paranormal fun in there along with her trademark screwball love story. She is, in my opinion, the greatest science fiction writer still producing new work, and one of the greatest writers ever to meld science fiction and comedy, and this little book is just another example of her fun side."
4,Where is H.L. Menken when we need him?,"This book is about the fact that we do need H.L. Menken. Right away! Yes, it's short. However, in case you haven't been watching the news there is a new attempt to get creationism taught in school (now it's called ""intelligent design""). And there has been recent debate over how much of a scientist's background should come out with his scientific findings. People who respect science need a champion these days. For my money it's Connie Willis. Always entertaining, tried and true, and skewering the ridiculous. I loved the book."
5,Amazing recipes!,"I love cooking, but I can sometimes get bored with it. I received this cookbook as a gift and LOVED IT! It has nutritional facts for each recipe, tells you how many servings of dairy/protein/fat/vegetables/fruits each recipe has, and general ""healthy eating habits""I get excited about cooking this stuff because I know it will taste good and be healthy for me. BLACK BEAN BURGER IS TO DIE FOR!!!!"
2,Recipes too complicated for daily use,"This is a good cookbook to use if you are cooking a special meal or something. But doesn't do much for you as far as recipes to use daily if you are on a diet. They require so many different ingredients that it will cost a fortune just to do a few meals from this book a week. Also, it doesnt' tell you preparation time. Not useful for what I wanted it for."
3,The recipes looked great but...,"Everything was written to serve 4-6. I know it's simple enough to just cut everything in half. Never got a chance to try anything because our puppy found the book to be more delicious than the recipes, but what I skimmed through looked great before it was torn to shreds."
1,Not worth half the cost.,"I bought this thinking that the Mayo Clinic (here in MN.) would have recipes that I would enjoy. WRONG! The book is written for the elite. Most of the ingredients you won't be able to pronounce (even if you have heard of them before.) and you certainly won't find them in any of the local stores.If you own a Lexus and want this for your cook, it may be fine -- if you work for a living or live in the mid-west, forget it -- it is a waste of $$.I wish I could give it no stars because it isn't worth a thing to me.D.Barrows"
2,Doesn't look good,"I bought the ""Mayo Clinic Healthy Weight for Everybody"" book because I didn't want a ""fad"" diet, I wanted a healthy eating plan. I fell in love with that book so I bought ""the New Mayo Clinic Cookbook"" to have additional recipes. I haave to admit that I have not cooked one single recipe from it. I've looked through it several times and haven't found anything that even looks appealing. I DO like that the recipes have the pyramid on each page so you can stay on track with the healthy eating plan without any extra work. What I don't like is that there isn't anything I want to try."
1,Not worth the price,"This cookbook received rave reviews and is from a world reknown hospital. Sounded great but what a disappointment! A handfull of recipes, nothing new or exciting or even inspiring. I felt I wasted my time and money on this one and returned it. I would have given it 0 stars if that was an option."
4,Good that I am not so old.,"If I was any older i might have gone to god.It took eight days to deliver,when i was told by phone it would be three to five days.Please put BY THE PLANET IN ORBIT.NEVER AGAIN. Four Stars for the product."
1,Never Got it !!! Store isn't worth it !!,"I will really like to review this product but I NEVER received it, after sending 3 separate emails to Eforcity and waiting 22 days AFTER the delivery estimate I decided to buy another one so I foundSony Ericsson W810 LCD Screen Protectorand this one arrived on time and has proven to be a great product since.Don't get anything from Eforcity, it's a waste of money and time.You have been warned !!!!"
4,w810 screen protector,"this is a great product, i wanted a quality product and this is high quality, this product keeps your phone looking brand new, i highly recommend this product to everyone, this product will protect your screen from scratchs"
5,A gem of a release,"I've been hoping and waiting for a release like this for a while, and they finally did it. 1980-81 is one of the most electrifying periods for the Dead, and Go to Nassau beautifully demonstrates why. The playing is clean and crisp with tight vocal harmonies that were never duplicated as well as the '80's wore on. The recording is a stunningly vibrant mix that provides an excellent balance of depth of sound and clarity that brings out the liveness of the show in a way that many other soundboard recordings fail to do. To top everything off, the song selection is exciting with excellent variety. The standouts include the Franklin's Tower, Feel Like a Stranger, and a rare '80's Lazy Lightning>Supplication."
2,This is beginning to get boring!,"Nothing new to report here, except we have yet another live release[are we up to 50 live cd's now?] of Grateful Dead music that offers nothing new and is only intended for hardcore fans who want to hear ""Franklins Tower"" or ""Good-Lovin"" for the 80th time. When Mr. Garcia passed away that was truly the end of the Grateful Dead as an active creative group. What we have now are record companies, who continue to cash in on their library of stored away live grateful Dead music. Compare ""Europe 72"" to this garbage and you will see what I am talking about! Let the Dead rest in peace and stop these ridiculous Bi-monthly live releases."
3,"GO TA NASHOO,BLESS YOU","IT IS ALWAYS NICE TO SEE A DIFFERENT SHOW FROM THIS YEAR 1980,IT IS IN THE SAME VEIN AS GO TO HEAVEN BUT LIVE LIKE DEAD RECKONING,AGAIN LIKE THEY SAY EACH SHOW HAS ITS OWN UNIQUENESS,THE SETLIST IS GREAT AND A LIVE ALTHEA IS ALWAYS WELCOME HEAR ALOT OF PLAYFUL GUITAR FROM JERRY AND A VERY CATCHY RYTHEM AS WELL,THIS SONG REALLY STANDS OUT FOR ME.I RECOMMEND THIS TO THE NEW DEADHEAD,CHECK OUT THE NEW BOOK ""DEADHEADS TAPING ADDENDIUM VOLUME#4 COMING OUT SOON YOU'LL GET A FULL FEEL FOR WHAT THE DEAD DID,HOW&WHERE ECT.,DEADBASES ARE A PLUS,IT WILL FILL THOSE VOIDS.~LARRY/TAPETRADER/DEADHEAD :},:},:}"
4,Nassau Coliseum 1980,Great sound...recording...jammin'...Feels>Althea is nearly 20 minutes in length...Could almost qualify for a Dick's Pick's???Check it out...
3,,"Veterans of the death metal genre, Grave, has unleashed another cool album that isn't afraid to add groove to death metal and make it sound good (which usually isn't the case). Thankfully, we have no melody, no nice moments, no keyboards, this is straight ahead death metal that still sounds lethal in the year 2006. Grave are great in creating headbanging moments through catchy hooks, while the brutality of the music remains intact. The only downside to this disc is their cover of Alice in Chains' ""Them Bones"". Why? Not that AIN were a great band in the first place, but that song is simply horrible and giving it the death metal touch doesn't help its cause. Aside from this, the album delivers what you'd expect from Grave."
3,Looks like a TV pilot because it is,This is a fun movie to watch however it has the look and feel of a TV pilot.Joe Keyes (Michael Beihm) is hired to find a missing husband and help him kill someone. He does his job too well and finds himself involved a mystery that involved indestructible ice-cream men and only gets weirder from their.However you will recognize the mystery and the bad guy (John de Lancie) from Star Trek. And the dialog as a substandard Sam Spade.
2,too much red for me,"this whole movie was.... well...about red.The concept sounded interesting since I like sci-fi and fantasy movies. Deep red is a substance that can make you immortal. A little girl has it in her body, and there are evil scientists who are out to get her. Even this simple storyline could have been made so much more interesting if (1) they did not spend a major portion of the movie just using the word ""deep red""... it sounds cheesy after a while (2) the action scenes were better shot (3) they added some sidelines to the story rather than continuing with the monotonous main thread."
1,"Spanish explorations, missions of Edwards Plateau 1582-1700","Very little information on the native americans of the region, mostly describing the various mission, friars, expeditions, travels, of norther Mexico and the southwest central portion of Texas (edwards plateau region). 90% about early European travels, 10% about native americans. Not recommended."
2,I did not receive my item,"I did not receive my item. As u can see, you have my order but I did not receive my product please inform me of any where abouts of my order. Thank you for your cooperation."
2,Not one of Hoff's best,"Sorry, this book reeks to me of late-career ""cashing in"" on the D&tD; legend. For me, Hoff's original ""Danny and the Dinosaur"" is a classic work, a brilliantly simple book, with a lovely fantasy story and exquisitely simple, highly memorable illustrations.Unfortunately ""Happy Birthday"" was drawn by Hoff in his eighties, and the illustrations barely resemble the characters I know and love. Sad to say, it looks like the poor guy can barely control the pen. I can't deny that Hoff (and now, his estate) deserves every penny he could squeeze from his beloved characters, but the characters (and the readers) do deserve better than this weak sequel."
1,Not Good,"The title pretty much says it all. In my opinion, this is the worst album that they put out."
4,Second disc is superb.,"I like the second disc much more than the first one (the ""The Chateau D'Isaster Tapes""). The second disc offers a good sample platter of many of the musical and vocal styles that Ian Anderson created over the years. The first disc is for hardcore Tull fans, I believe (I like it, just not as much...). The second disc had more broader appeal."
4,A toast to Tull for a treat!,"The first CD is nonsensical, but in a Very Good Way. It's much more playful than its cousin (A Passion Play), though it is quite interesting to listen to the two side-by-side just for the sake of comparison.The second CD leaves me, like many other reviewers, wondering why some of these songs were left off of the regular releases. My particular favorites: ""Silver River Turning"", ""Man of Principle"", ""Rosa on the Factory Floor"", ""Lights Out"" and ""I Don't Want to Be Me""."
4,EXCELLENT MIX OF PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED MATERIAL,"This was a wonderful find for me, a long-time Tull fan, because it contains so many songs from earlier Tull periods (when the group was best, in my opinion). There are some alternate takes on some familiar compositions (the pieces from the PASSION PLAY era are instantly recognizable), but mostly, these CDs contain previously unreleased material that is of excellent quality. An absolute must for anyone who has enjoyed Tull during the many phases of the group's distinguished career."
5,A classic,"Every girl will love this book. Have you ever had a domineering friend you can't help but idolize, and you end up doing things that you normally would not just to impress her? That's Victoria.The story takes place at a girls' school and it is seen through the eyes of Victoria's slightly shlumpy friend, Dilys,who thinks that Victoria's life is so much more interesting than hers.This book has all the elements - secret clubs, that stomachache you can get when you're excluded, and the mysterious, glamorous Victoria, who is the ringleader of all the girls and goads them (sometimes not so nicely) into doing things to remain in her secret club.It is so satisfying, I really give it my highest recommendation."
4,Quite nice for the price,"I bought this with an Xbox->USB adapter for use with my livingroom based computer and arcade games. Windows recognizes it as a native game controller right away without any special drivers. Fired up Ms. Pacman and immediately felt much more at home vs. playing with a gamepad. The controls are a little squishy compared to a true arcade stick, but this is probably due to the analog capabilities. Tried a few other games, the buttons are nice and crisp.Overall it's a very nice addition and it works quite well. Worth the $30 for sure."
1,Poor quality,"Purchased for my wife to play Ms Pacman on Xbox. Worked very well, but only lasted 15 minutes before the down control stopped working. Played around with it for a while, but could not get it working again. Returned and got another one, hoping that we just got a bad one. Unfortunately, the replacement only lasted a few minutes longer before it no longer worked to move right. Could actually hear noises coming from inside the controller when moving the joystick to the right, so I assume that something broke in the inside. Now my wife is not a big person, and most teenage boys are much stronger than her, so I doubt that this joystick could last the abuse that a teenage boy would give it. Would definitely not recommend this item."
3,Cheap and cheaply made,"This was about the only arcade stick I could find for the xbox. It seemed cheaply made when I first unpacked it, but it worked flawlessly when I started playing with it. After about an hour of Metalslug something in the joystick broke. It still works, but there was previously some push-in action with the stick. Now it is just loose and slips in and out. Not really an issue if you are just playing arcade games with it, but it makes me wonder what is next to go."
4,Superb collection,"I loved this collection and think that it is a very complete Greatest Hits album. Although I pass right over everything by Spooky Tooth, I do like Lou Gramm's solo efforts. This Greatest Hits collection speaks for itself."
4,It's the best there is on foreigner.....,"The first pressing of the anthology had at the end of disc 1 two Spooky Tooth songs on it. Now just recently they took the song ""All sewn up"" off and replaced it with another track of the best selling album ""4"" which makes sense since this is a foreigner anthology not another bands. personally im glad they made the change. but overall all the hits and next best songs after the hits are here in better sound than ever. good liner notes and nice packaging make this an essential purchase for any rock&roll fan."
3,"Good, but could be better.","I bought this compilation so I could take all of Foreigner's hits with me without lugging all of the CDs. Unfortunately, many of the songs are edited to AM radio length, giving this collection a ""Foreigner Lite"" feel to it. ""Hot Blooded"" which is a short song to begin with, has been reduced to one verse and the solo. I would have been willing to lose the Spooky Tooth songs, as well as Lou Gramm's solo stuff to make room for the full length tracks. For the casual listener, it's probably fine."
3,You Can't Keep a Good Caine Down.,"BULLSEYE. Leonard Maltin, my video guru, rated this a ""Bomb.""Well, usually he's right - but in this case you might be surprised howsilly-good this dvd is. Michael Caine and Roger Moore playdual roles - bumbling thieves vs. renegade scientists)- aided and nodoubt ""inspired"" by the always voluptuous Sally Kirkland (check her out inthe equally screwy COLD FEET, where she rides, chestal area bared to theprairie winds, atop an RV!). Caine, Moore & Company keep the pace going.I can't sum the plot up in a sentence; but I know I laughed - a lot. LovedMr. Caine fighting himself on board the Orient Express: not quite James Bond vs.Red Grant in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE; but it'll do.Sorry, Leonard."
1,This emperor has no clothes,"Wow--did I read the same book the reviewers read? ""Don't the Moon Look Lonesome"" just earned the dubious honor of worst book our book group has read in over ten years. Crouch's thin and unconvincing portrayals of Max and Carla reflect a deeply rooted racism that would be unacceptable coming from any white author, and dropping a few names into the mix doesn't make it a book about the jazz scene. The ""Don't the Moon Look Lonesome"" that I read is misogynistic, homophobic, and profoundly antisemitic. To top it all off, Crouch's prowess as a journalistic writer isn't reflected here: his prose is alternately turgid and cliched, the book rambles badly, and it takes him far too long to say what he has to say--he could easily have offended as many people in half the number of pages. Where was this man's editor?"
1,i tried to like this book.,"honestly, i did...i spent over a month trying to get into it, even skipped some chapters. sometimes i think crouch tries too hard to show readers that he can write, by utilizing multiple voices, flashbacks, etc. it left me confused and it made the story very hard to follow. i tried to stick with it, because i loved the subject of interracial love, but the convoluted telling frustrated me..i may go back to it later...sometimes, less is more, stanley..."
3,The title is accurate,"40 lessons cover the topic, but it is simplified, basic and its practical use may be open to interpretation. I am glad I read it, not sure I would spend time with it again. Piston and Rimsky K. should be read on this topic."
3,Comprehensive,"This is a very comprehensive study of the New Testament. It thoroughly covers the historical context of the Gospels as well. The only negative aspect I noticed was that it has a secular viewpoint which isn't necessarily bad, only at times rather than explaining the New Testament writings the author seems to denounce them. Overall it is a well researched yet slightly pessamistic view of the New Testament."
3,One sided,"As a student of professor Ehrman, I think that he does a terrific job of explaining *his* view of the NT documents, their context, and their importance. What it does not address is the opposite side of the issue such as a new book due out called ""The Case against Q."" Much of Ehrman's view is based on this Q source theory...and when/if it falls, then so do the claims in this book. Also, many of the claimed ""contradictions"" in the book are not actually contradictions. Some are paradox, and some are ""contradictions"" that have long ago been cleared up. However, if you are looking for an interesting read, I highly recommend this book...just not from a theological perspective(which was clearly not his aim). I would, however, take it all with a grain of salt. Make sure to read books on the other side, because you will not find the other side's views here."
3,Book condition,"Except for several marred pages at the beginning, the book was in satisfactory condition. This was my first expeerience purchasing a used item, so I was not sure what to expect."
4,Qualified Very Good,"Dr. Ehrman gave me a good review/update. I needed this very much as I earned my degree from seminary in 1958 and so much has happened since then. The book was very readable; it was in tended for his students. I appreciated his bibliography. As an historical overview it does not cover all the material that is necessary for a rounded education. Sometimes his conservative Christian theology creeps in to his evaluation of material. I find his insistance that Jesus is an apocalyptic prophet is unconvincing, and it pervades a good deal of his findings of other New Testament books. That John the Baptist was apocalyptic and that the early Christians had among them people who were apocalyptic is not proof of Jesus' position. I feel it is possible, but nopt probable. Read Crossan or Funk for another view."
2,"Beautifully laid out, but as with with most textbooks it has many preconceived notions that don't give both sides of the argumnt","Some very interesting pictures and information however when it comes to the detail of authorship of books included in the canon, it's arguments are presumptuous without giving a reasons why some lie on one side of the argument and why some are on the other. Instead it uses words like 'most scholars today agree...' Which is in effect is a false statement. My guess is this book is a textbook for the author and colleagues of like mind that would like to emphasize a way of thinking upon unsuspecting freshmen."
3,Black Nationalism at it's strongest and wildest,"Carlos Cooks was something of the mid-20th century version of Khallid Muhammad. Think Minister Louis Farrakhan can get outrageous? You ain't heard nothing yet! Carlos Cooks (a Harlem Street Speaker of the 40s thru 60s) used a lot of wild humor and shock theater to get his message across. His speech on Adam and Eve and it's relationship to Black people must be read to be believed! It seems that there were very few leaders that he really liked. Nkrumah, Haile Selassie, Fidel Castro, and many others take their lumps here along with any Black person who diverts from his dogmatic view of Blackness. Recommended for the most hardcore of militants and Black history fans only. This ain't Martin Luther king by a longshot here, so be warned!"
2,80's Regional Rock,"""See the Light"" is the best cut on the CD. A slow building to a climax yet compellingly driven song. The main reason I bought the album back in the 80's and why I tried to source the CD. Otherwise, their writing - production - direction and overall selection of music is highly overrated!!"
1,Hard to Follow Hadrian.,"The author is scholarly, and her work shows a great deal of thought--but little joy. This is a difficult read! Instead of being a purely scholarly presentation, it was 50% conjecture, mixed with the idea that you would know some of the scholarly research. There were multiple times where the author assumed the reader knew things no one but a student of Hadrian would. And fully more than half of the book dealt with Antinous, not Hadrian. (The author theorizes that Antinous was a homosexual lover of Hadrian, whose death an a trip to Egypt drove Hadrian insane.) What reading this book did for me was teach me that Hadrian was a fascinating individual--and I'd like now to read something about him. Previous to this, my only knowledge of him was that he commissioned a Wall in Northern England. Now I know that he commissioned thousands of projects all over the Roman empire. It is a pity the author didn't more than mention a few. Hadrian was fascinating; this book about him isn't."
3,Surprisingly dry,"I read the entire book, but never felt like the author had gotten into Hadrian. I don't think this was the book she really meant to write."
3,historical,Following Hadrian was interesting historically and kept my interest through the story interwoven through it. It gave an interesting perspective on the influences that made Hadrian act as he did.
2,Disappointing,"This disk delivered a whole lot less than I was expecting. That may be my fault. It consisted mostly of period still photos with a voice-over of a man reading a script. There are some color clips of the site today, a tourist attraction. All the prisoner barracks and other important buildings are gone. One gets little sense of how Buchenwald looked back then.As for the central character, the villainess, she is a slightly cleaned up version of what I had read about her. According to this, many of the crimes of which she was accused were never proved, i.e., of having lampshades and other items made from the tatooed skin of slain prisoners, of hhaving shrunken heads, of having sex with prisoners and then seeing them killed. It almost feels as if she were not really an ogre at all but a somewhat misunderstood victim of her time. Perhaps it is true, but if it is, the disk doesn't make that convincing."
1,I found this incredibly BORING BORING BORING,waste of my time and money. Fell asleep the first 3 times I tried to watch. Finally made it through. BORING.
3,Better than DVD,"All in all the picture quality is better than the standard DVD. The sound is where the big difference is really noticed. This is a definite upgrade. However, the way the discs are packaged back to back makes them difficult to remove from the box set without bending them. Also, the menu on these discs leaves something to be desired from a blu-ray format. It comes up from the bottom and can't be accessed until you are past the introduction of the show, strange. The options are somewhat limited as well. Hopefully this will be improved on season 8."
3,Smallville Watcher,"I love how you're given a booklet on each episode with their original airdate, the extras, and the price is right for online purchase."
2,why cant he fly yet..... and wheres lex....hmmmm,"eight seasons later and he still can not fly, plus when he fights its one stupid hit then its over. and not having lex in the eight season is just nuts, he made the show, the only other good actor in the season eight in the green arrow/ queen... but i gave up watching its, getting lame!! dont waste your money!!!"
4,Smallville - Seventh Season,"I really like the series, but I thought that season seven was a little weak. I didn't really care for Kara and was disappointed that Lana wasn't in it for half the season. Even though Lana could be annoying, I liked it when they let her be bad. As always though, love Chloe!"
5,great series,what a great show! love to watch with my husband and it definatley keeps you wanting more. Helps that most of the actors and special guest are so great too!
4,Almost there!,"I love Smallville. I'm a huge Superman nerd and when I stumbled across Smallville, I was hooked from day one. Season 7 was great with Supergirl showing up. Still left a lot to be desired."
3,jeez! put on the cape already!,"WHY OH WHY HASNT HE LEARNED TO FLY YET!?and whats up with doomsday comming way too early! whats with thesedirectors they know nothing about the characters or villians entryor exits they just throw them in when they feel like it i belivelex is building the ""legion of doom"" and is green arrow the founderof the justice leauge? bring on green lantern already lets justsscrew up the entire history of heroes and villians but i cant stop watching for some hipnotic reason!"
5,Smallville The Complete Seventh Season,thank You so much amazon.....your estimate time of arrival was on the dot!! product was great!!
4,Smallville 7th season,"Smallville - The Complete Seventh SeasonI bought this to continue my completed ""Smallville"" collection. It was good, everything as described. Would have liked there to have been a ""gag"" reel though, I really enjoy those."
3,"Sean Pasek is spot on, but too high score","Sean is right, too many highly anticipated moments were a let down by poor disjointed writing. I too am a great fan since season 1 and would rate most seasons a 5, unfortunately this season fell short of its usually stellar performances, especially Lana's character. A few great shows saved this from being a 1 or 2."
4,Another good season,"This season introduces Supergirl and Bizarro and includes the return Pete Ross. Another good installment in the Smallville mythos. One drawback: due to the writer's stick, it is only 20 episodes, not 22."
2,Not very good.,"Smallville started out with such promise. But somewhere along the way it got derailed. Maybe it was the repetitive nature of each episode. Maybe it was the hokey dialogue, 1 dimensional characters or uninspired plot lines. All three? I was hoping when they finally pushed him out of Smallville and into Metropolis that the show would get more interesting, but alas, that never happened. Unfortunately, this show is best enjoyed for free. I kind of wish I didn't spend the money to buy this set, but the OCD guy in me wanted to complete the collection."
5,Smallville Season 7,"Great Season, I have come late to the Smallvilee Party and just catching up! very pleased with the show!"
2,Frequent sexualization of youth,Superheroes were first scripted as holding to high moral standards in all areas. They served as good role models for kids. That has all changed. Too bad. Smallville otherwise has much going in its favor.
3,The least-favorite season of smallville,"This whole season wraps up the ""teenage-like"" years by getting rid of all parental figures. The whole time giving it an empty feel to every scene. The ending wasn't as strong as season 6 and is lacking a lot from the whole crew.Hopefully Smallville can recover from this and clean up and become slicker in the future."
3,time to fly tom,"good season shame its the last we see of lex, time to fly tom its getting annoying, happy to see green arrow back one episode not enough, and the episode where lex kills lionel ive watched that over and over a tv show cant get much better than this ,hope season eight works should be interesting without micheal and kristin, still green arrow will be a regular, will season 8 be the last???"
5,Smallville Season 7,This is a great series. The stories are able to pull you in and keep you interested and the little nods to the characters previous presentations and the entire DC Universe are great. They're a fun thing to look for- And Supergirl is awesome and hott.
5,Smallville Rules!!!,"Smallville is, by far, my favorite show on television. I recently purchased a 37"" HDTV and a Blu-ray player and to be able to buy my favorite show on Blu-ray just makes the experience so much better. I have all 7 seasons available, so far and when Season 8 is released, I will purchase it on Blu-ray, as well. The only thing that threw me off about this purchase is that the Amazon description says it's 6 discs, but it's only 3. This should be fixed to exclude any confusion, but other than the confusion, this product is perfection. I recommend this show to anyone who is a Superman fan, as it is the only successful Superman show to air."
4,Yes!!!!,"I am a big Superman fan. I absolutely love Smallville. There are so many mixed reviews about this season, I don't understand. I am such a loyal fan, I simply love the fact that new episodes are available. If it were up to me, the show would continue until its 15th season. Hahaha"
4,Most Enjoyable,"We have gotten every season of Smallville since they've come out, and have thoroughly enjoyed the series. I believe after watching this season that this has been the best season so far.A lot of twists and turns, introductions to new characters, some old faces, and a lot more development of Clark Kent into Superman. And let's not forget Supergirl...So all in all, if you're thinking about buying this set, don't be afraid, it's worth it...probably more so than most of the others."
3,Mistake in first episode,"Once again Warners can't be bothered to check these things before they sell them. Much like the repeated scene in Justice League Unlimited Season 1, there's a glitch in the episode Bizarro. During the final fight with Bizarro there is a scene where Clark heals his wounds in the sunlight. In the broadcast version Clark's hand heals then he looks into the light before the cut on his face heals. The DVD skips this and plays the face healing scene twice. It's a small gripe but quite annoying given it's happening more and more with Warner releases, especially since they refuse to fix such problems and continue to sell the defective discs."
4,Bad Blu-Ray Episode Menu,All Smallvilles are fun and well done. The previous Complete Seasons were easy to skip to individual episodes and sections within. The latest Blu Ray interface for this set is inane ... no episode menu that I can access using PS3 DVD player. One is forced to treat Season Seven Blu-Ray like a VHS and scan linearly. Retrograde.The generating studio's technical staff should be upgraded or re-educated to modern User Interface standards.
4,Could be clearer.,"The picture quality was a little grainy at SD, but when I checked back in to watch the rest of the episode, it seemed a little clearer."
5,Seventh Season,"I'm re watching the smallville series. I realize that I missed a few episodes, its like watching for the first time. Great series!"
5,Smallville,"I've been a Smallville fan from the very first episode. To be honest you almost have to be kind of a nerd to love this show. This season is sooo good and intriguing. I love how the writers and directors of this show are really consistent about keeping their audience interested. The actors are also really awesome. That makes this show one of my favorites. If you like superman and like DC comics in general, why not try it. Start from Season 1 though. Hulu is always playing Smallville. And if you really like it you'll want to start collecting."
4,Good Season,I have all the seasons and like watching all of them but this is one of the weaker seasons out there a but the story really gets good in some of the later episodes. Still love it!!!
1,disappointment twice,Smallville - The Complete Seventh SeasonPaid a lot returned got a new one still does not work I believe there a fault in all the 7th season dvds
4,The Series is only getting better!,Smallvilel Season was amazing. Much better than Season 6 for sure. Cant wait for Season 7.
5,Smallville: The Complete Seventh Season [Blu-ray],received the item super quick. unopened like it should be. very happy with the service.
5,Special K,"This is a good series, if you enjoy Superman. Can't wait till the next season is available. Please hurry, I am in suspense."
5,Reinventing Superman,"Long overdue, this clever retcon of Superman has been consistently good for ten years. New wrinkles and textures have been added to the Man of Steel's character, giving viewers a glimpse into what makes the world's greatest hero tick. In this season, Clark moves beyond his relationship with Lana and Lex becomes more and more of a dirtbag."
5,great gift,"Got this as a gift for my husband who used to troll the channels trying to find Smallville on the syndication networks. Imagine his surprise when, on Christmas morning he opens up a box with all 9 seasons in it!!!"
4,New blood Cousin not Lasting Long,"When the actress playing Lois came to the show she was sassy brilliant beautiful and a new spark for the show so I actually hoped Clark's cousin would at least be Interesting. NOT! The shows been nothing more than a soap opera anymore and the new blood just does not help. At least use a girl that's had a few acting lessons & not just a nice body. She has 3 expressions. Does everybody know this Is the last season for the Original creators ""Alfred Gough"" & ""Miles Miller""? I give this season 4 stars liberally and BECAUSE of the Blu Ray quality!!Non-Blu-Ray gets 3 stars. With them leaving they had the rules Clark never flies, no cape etc. What will change now?"
2,Very weak season,"Very weak season fellas...Seasons 4, 5, and 6 were each better than 7.Spend a little more time on the plotlines, huh?D."
4,Good not Great for this Season,"I love this show and have never missed an episode. This season you can tell they are trying to wrap up the show. I do believe that Season 8 is the Final season for Smallville. It is a season of amazing episodes then some real flops. I still suggest anyone to watch this show, it is still one of the best shows on TV."
1,The decline and fall of Smallville,"This show was one of television's stars a few seasons ago. Unfortunately, the plots have descended into trivial shells of stories told on earlier seasons. The cast either has struggled with the weak storylines or left the show. Outside of 9 to 12 year old pre-teen fans, I don't recommend this DVD set for anyone looking for quality entertainment."
2,Adoption and Recovery review by mary,"The first half of the book was mainly about grief in adoption, and how to cope. The second half was a question and answer from various people. I really liked the second half the best. Until the author says all adoptions should stop because of the grief involved. She means no adoptions ever. Well of course I was totally throwed by that view. The author doesn't say what to with children if they don't get adopted. What a nut case I thought. I threw the book in the trash. The author is a birthmom, and I think because of her pain she had in her adoption plan, she thinks its best if all adoptions stop. I wouldn't pay much for this book. Better yet e-mail me and I'll dig my copy out of the trash and give it away. from mary"
5,Lewis Taylor Seriously Gets To You,"What can I say? I love this album. It's been on random shuffle in our office for the past couple of days and every time I hear a track from it I think: ""I love this, who is it?"" It was Lewis, of course, the unbelievably talented brit creating some of the greatest Soul ever made. So last night I went out and bought a copy for myself and now it's everywhere -- my car, my computer, my ipod. Who'd a thought? Taylor's gotten under my skin -- in a really good way."
2,Best CD ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am a music expert & this CD is simply AMAZING!!!! Play soft or LOUD you will not be disappointed I tell you!!!! I owned Stoned for about 5 years, I play it to death."
5,Freakin awesome,"Actually not my favorite of the Lewis Taylor arsenal - but that doesn't mean it's not Freaking Awesome - because it is. It's just that the self titled ""Lewis Taylor"" is drool worthy, and the ""Lost Album"" is blow-minding. Not to mention, Stoned Part 2 (which is hard to find) has versions of the same songs which are just as cool but different enough to be different songs. You just can't lose with Lewis Taylor.So the fact that this album is Freakin- awesome.. isn't a knock in the least. In fact, it's the album that got me totally and plutonically infatuated with LT - which I still am and always will be. Buy this album... too slow! :) Buy it again :)"
5,"Refreshing, Shocking, Gorgeous","What a refreshing shock this album will be to music lovers and musicians alike - it certainly was to me. Take the one-man arranging/recording experimentalism of Stevie Wonder, the guitar bravado of Hendrix, pop cheekiness of 80s Prince, and the musicality of The Beatles - and throw in Taylor's own unique ethos - and thus begets an album that has an immediate richness and 'listenability.' Describing music is a strange exercise, and I don't enjoy it. I'm posting here so that you listen to clips above for yourself, and if you like it even a bit, take the risk of buying this album - the rewards are great. The album is a freeing, effecting opus."
5,Perfume of the South-West,"Here is the perfume and visuals of the South-west.'Kiko' is to Los Lobos what the Brown album was for The Band. And it has a generosity, a scale, a warmth of compable magnitude, doing for their region what the aforementioned Band disc did for the East coast. The music is at once old and progressive. It's the perfect soundtrack to Sayles,'Lone Star' film,'Three Burials'(though Doug Sham's there and no argument with that), or even,'Big Lebowski'. The side project, Latin Playboys, is for me their only other set of similar impact. But, to continue the Band affinities, it's like 'Stagefright' after those 60s works of genius."
5,Kiko,"We heard a song - Kiko and the Lavendar Moon - from this CD on the radio. As soon as I got home, I ordered the CD. It was good as expected. I have a friend who is an avid Lobos fan. I want to add myself to that list now."
2,Disappointing,"When I first bought this album, I was disappointed by how far Los Lobos had strayed from the wonderful styles of their earlier work. They didn't sound like the same band, and the songs lack force. Some might call it innovation, but to me the songs on this album lack the intensity of early Lobos. I submit this to honestly counterbalance the usual overwhelmingly positive reviews one sees on Amazon."
4,Smooth music,"Quality music with quality musicians. Love the music, especially Kiko and the Lavender Moon. and best place to buy music is here."
5,Los Lobos' Sgt. Peppers,"I've got a half dozen of these guys' albums, most of which are great in their own right, but this is hands down, their absolute best. It got all kinds of accolades when it came out back in 1992. Sometimes, critics go goo-goo-ga-ga over some record, and later you wonder why. That's not the case here. This album has stood the test of time.They're doing this album live in its entirety in a few cities right now, but there's a chance they'll expand the tour. Not to be missed."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this thermometer to monitor temperatures in my backyard greenhouse in NYC.Although the outdoor probe is placed in an area sheltered from direct sunlight and rain, it simply stopped recording any outdoor data after about 1 week. The indoor function worked until our first Spring heatwave. I watched temperatures soar in the greenhouse upto max 119.6F without ventilation. The next day, the screen just blanked out. When I checked it again the following day, it was working. We again had a heatwave forecast at 95F with a 100-105F reel feel temperature, and the screen blanked out again. This time I had ventilation running in the greenhouse, which should have brought the temps down. I'm very disappointed I now have to seek another product."
1,Also failed,"Funny that I had to Google to find this in Amazon (I guess stuff that's sold out doesn't come up in the Amazon search) and then when I do I read the ""Failed in One Week"" review. Well, at least that reviewer got a week out of it. Mine failed in about 3 days. Several different batteries later and I determined that its the unit. Ditto ""how much trouble will I go to for a $15 thermometer"". Guess its the trash heap for this one."
1,Not accurate,"I bought this after reading the reviews here, thinking that this would be a value for money item. The thermometer failed the calibration test- the indoor and outdoor readings did not match up even though the sensors were in the same place. Further on, the readings were inaccurate and not consistent."
1,wrong temp!,"On my way to return this right now. I just unpacked this, and put a battery in it. The thermometers are totally off! One reads 70 degrees farenheit and the other reads 40 degrees farenheit! (the unit and the sensor are right next to eachother.) More frustration. Now I have to pack it back up, drive to return it and lose the time and gas money."
1,Disappointing All Around,I ordered this for my husband and was very disappointed when we went to use it that it was DOA. We tried several different batteries but it was def. not working.We returned it to Amazon only to find out that they no longer have the item available.I won't know if it was just a fluke or a bad item because I can't exchange it.
4,great product,"my only gripe is that the top of the three displays is either the indoor temp or the time. so close but so far, why hot have an option to have all 4 displayed. otherwise it's great. i use it in my camper trailer. and therefore i'd like to have the time and both temps available."
4,Cheap and reliable,"I've had my unit for 7 months and it has worked flawlessly. Hope that isn't the kiss of death. No problems, arrived quickly, set up was easy and is sits there telling me the humidity, outdoor temp and indoor temp. Actually, as far as I can tell, it's really pretty accurate. Very satisfied."
3,"Not backlit, difficult to see in some light","This seems to work (numbers are about what I expected) though I have not calibrated it to anything else. While the screen is large and the numbers clear, readability is poor in many light situations. Set up is easy and only 1 AAA battery required. It would be perfect if it could be read in all light situations."
2,inconsistent,"In a stable temperature environment, the temperature displays continually vary about 2-3 degrees every few seconds. Even with the external probe right next to the main unit, the temperatures reported are different by about 3-4 degrees. This unit is getting returned and I'll look for better one, even if it costs a few dollars more."
4,thermometer,This unit allows me to see the tempature in my pump house and my cabin temp at a glance.
4,works great,"I bought this for my baby's nursery to keep abreast of the humidity level in her room so I know when I need to turn on the humidifier. It works great- it also tells the inside and outdoor temps which are useful, and has a clock.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is b/c the sensor to measure the outside temp lost it's stick quickly, so it won't stick to the window anymore like it is supposed to- now i just shove it in this little catch on the window screen and it works fine. Th cord also doesn't allow you to shut the window completely, so if you want to lock it, you're out of luck (that is, if you want to measure the outside temp- you don't need to use this feature if you only want to measure the inside temp and humidity)."
2,Mine Is Junk Too!,"I refer to this unit as my random number generator because that is its only function, apparently. Both temperatures are off and the humidity reads about 5% high - the only thing consistent about it. If you decide to go for it, check it closely upon receipt. You might get lucky and get a good one but be prepared to send it back. First, test the two temp readouts side-by-each both at indoor and outdoor temps (or in home, fridge and/or freezer) and against something you have some confidence in.I suggest that when you run the outside thermocouple, mount it to a non-conductive surface or, better yet, just let it hang loose - away from the house and sunlight. Good luck!"
1,Doesn't work,"This item is very unreliable. I suspected the humidity readings were off because they seemed awfully low, so I finally learned a way to test it and discovered it was 8% off! That's quite a lot. An accurate hygrometer is very important to me so I can monitor the humidity in a room where I keep sensitive musical instruments. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed to purchase something that doesn't work very well. Next time I'd pay more to get a better product."
3,bedroom thermometer,"got this product to regulate the temperature in my bedroom. its an ok electronic thermometer.Pros:- big display screen- sleek modern look- easy to use buttonsCons:- very basic functionality ( for example the biggest negative for me is that the screen is divided into 3 and one cannot toggle the various functions between the 3 screens - ie upper side of screen is for indoor temperature and you can toggle the clock on that screen, middle screen is for outdoor temperature and cannot toggle anything, and bottom screen is for humidity cannot toggle. So if i want to see the time, inside temperature and humidity at the same time i cannot do this)all in all for the price its a decent product"
1,Don't buy it. It is as bad as everyone says,"I received this as a gift and they should have read the reviews before they bought it for me. It is way inaccurate! We shall try and send it back, but I am not sure if we can. The temperatures are off and the humidity is way off and usually does not even read when there is a 50% humidity."
5,Works great,"Great product, we use it here in Kandahar Afghanistan to ensure our equipment receives constant temperature updates for accurate operations. Very easy to set up, took less than 5 minutes. Only took a little over week to make it to our small FOB in Afghanistan by standard shipping."
1,worked for only 3 hours,This is the 2nd one i've owned-my puppy chewed the 1st one that worked great-i had it for 2 years. This one i had only a few hours and it stopped working. Sent back to amazon for a full refund-i bought a different brand.
2,Off,"It works fine but the readings are about 4 degrees off. When the outside sensor is placed next to the unit, both readings - in and out - should be the same yet there is a 4 degree difference. Which reading is correct ?????"
5,Perfect for monitoring pet tanks!,"I have two reptiles, a boa and a gecko. For both of these guys I have to keep an eye on the temp's on both sides of the tank and the humidity. this product is absolutely perfect for doing that. The screen is large enough that I can read it clearly from across the room. It has different settings, one for viewing the time inside temp and humidity, the one I use shows inside and outside temp's and humidity, and I think there are like 2 or 3 more. Both of mine worked right out of the box (with batteries of course). I would definitely recommned this product for anything with an exotic pet."
3,Overall good,I didn't have any kind of problems with this thermometer and it seems to be working well. The only weak point is that you can't simply unplug the wire to the external sensor. That means that it can't be simply moved from a room to another without removing the wire.
1,Temperature range is a fail,"Note that this only goes down to 32F on one of the thermometers and -4F on the other thermometer. This makes it useless in a northern climate. It gets down to -45F here in Vermont. Any thermometer should have the full range that might be experienced, indoors or outdoors, -90F to +140F. I was puzzled why it bottomed out at 32F until I came back and read the description here. Fail."
2,A few degrees off.,"I like the Timex TX5170. It's easy to read and simple to set up. My complaint is that the readouts, though consistent, are not accurate. On my unit the indoor temperature reads 2 degrees lower than the actual temperature andthe outside sensor reads 4 degrees below the actual temperature."
2,Cool for the few days it worked.,"This seemed to be a quality item until it totally stopped working after a few days. Kinda cheap quality. Maybe I got a ""lemon""?"
1,WTF was he thinking here?,"I really wanted to like this. I even read it a second time and I still felt like something was edited out as it's disjointed and missing something to make the story workable. There's some parts that are good but the lingering thought remains that it's either too long or not long enough.Satire? The joke fell flat.Parody? It's not clear what it's mocking. ""Reality TV"" is too easy.Feel free to disagree but the ending and the characters aren't compelling. I also read his first novel afterwards and I liked that but wondered what went wrong with this effort."
1,Worst book I've ever read!,"No plot line...need I say more? Do not, under any circumstances, read this book!"
3,"Black & Decker CST800 8"" cordless string trimmer",I was disapointed that power was diminished after 1/2 hour. I had recharged the trimmer over a 48 hour period.E.L.
2,"8-15 minutes run time, 24 hours to charge between uses!","I bought this elsewhere, but it went back to the store unused when I discovered (through calling Black & Decker, as they didn't include this little detail at the store OR in the product manual) that the device requires a minimum of 24 hours of charging between uses!That wouldn't be a big deal, except it only runs for an advertised 8 to 15 minutes on one charge! I figured, trim, let it charge for a few hours, then trim more if I need to. But I'm not going to build my whole weekend around having enough time to get in an additional trimmer power charge!"
1,Trimmer Product Review,"This product, which had been discontinued by B&D had been sitting on the shelf for a number of years, allowing the shelf life of the dry cell battery to pass. The result is I can't get a full charge and only get 20 minutes of run time between charges (should be 1 hr.) This is a problem that both whosalers and retailers almost always overlook."
4,Good value,This is the second one we purchased. We wanted two because the battery power doesn't last long enough to edge the entire yard. Other than that- it is a great edger.
3,Black & Decker cordless electric stringer trimmer,I am not sure how to answer this. Do not know if it is my problem orthe Stringers. Have trouble with the string breaking. Glad it is easyto reload. Is light weight and easy to use for the most.
1,Don't buy it!,"The .065 trim line just doesn't hold up, and I had to open the feeder and redo the trim line almost every minutes.I am gonna return it this weekend."
2,Dissapointed,"I am very dissapointed in this product. I've owned it less than 2 years and it has already fallen apart and I need to buy a new trimmer. I have less than 1/8 of an acre and the battery only lasted long enough to do the inside or the outside of the fence, not both. So it would always take me 2 days to do the yard. The line jammed a lot and had to be refed constantly. I'm not buying another black and decker."
1,Don't Purchase even for small jobs,"This product should never have been placed on store shelves. The cord breaks approximately every two minutes. I have a tiny yard and just wanted a trimmer that could work for five minutes. Sure, it holds a charge for that long and is light weight but with cord problems it is no fun to use. My experiences has proven over and over again, that B & D makes bright colorful disposable products that aren't meant to be used!"
2,Disappointed,"I had one of these for years, worked great, then bought this one, and only lasted 1 1/2 years, with little use. Switch went on it."
1,Not good for Mac users,This is a terrible collection. Bought it and couldn't actually get to the images. I am a Photoshop user and have some experience with image manipulation etc. and am a long time Mac user. Contacted technical support via e-mail and they told me they couldn't help me. This collection was created by a PC person and adapted to Mac. Don't buy it. Save your money and buy a good Mac collection. Returned Clip Art 2.5 Million and only got back 15 of the dollars that it cost me in the first place.
1,There should be a software LAW for BUYERS,"This is a bundle of junk. Unless I installed it wrong (and my husband and I are not computer/software idiots) there is no user interface. I couldn't even find the free subscription for a year to clipart.com. What a bundle of crap. Buyer beware, the only good side of this is that it was only $30. But I could have bought my children some Amazon.com books with that $30. By the way, I have Windows XP. And what really sucks is that I had to give it one star. It deserves a ZERO RATING."
4,Saves more than $100,"The software itself has little value, the value of the product lies in its one-year free subscription to [...]. The first year I bought it I found the free subscription key on the bottom of the box and subscribed successfully to clipart.com, which saved me more than $100. I bought it again, the second year, but it came without the box, but the company I bought it from (Cyber City Software) were kind enough to send me the key number, which has again saved me more than $100."
5,great system for a college student budget,"being a college student and a home theater fan, i wanted to purchase a system that would fit in a small space yet still give me the sound for a decent price. This system is perfect for that and I recommend to anyone. Only thing i have to say that is bad is that it doesnt have an s-video output. but other than that it is awesome"
4,"Good creeper, rolls easy, could be a bit lower.","I am 6'1"" and 200 lbs and the size of this roller easily accommodates my size. My arms are completely free to work on my vehicle.It could be a bit lower, but in general is exactly what I wanted. The rolling is *very* easy."
2,Raw,"My first reaction to Live: What You and I Have Been Through was - is my hearing failing? The album sounds like what I would imagine a bootleg recording to sound like. If that is what you are in to, then plunk down the change. If you are expecting a full range of sound and a well mixed recording capturing nuances that make up for not being there, then buy another album. If this were the first exposure I had to Blues Traveler it would have been the last. Don't let this be the first BT work you buy."
5,Best commercial release by the Travelers to date,"Okay, I gotta say I did not hae high hopes for this album. The almost lack of segues and heavy ladling of bridge tunes didn't sound all that appealing.I was wrong. To put it another way, the members of Blues Traveler have once again proven that they are collectively god.This album really captures the new, looser sound of the new band members in a live setting. Good job BT!"
1,Has a troubling diagram,"The book does an adequate job at teaching the ""how to do"" celestial navigation, cookbook style. The ""theory"" section on ""how it works"" bothers me because it uses a diagram where the earth is shown as flat and the star so close to the earth that it erroneously explains the difference in angle (as you move away from the position directly under the star) by simple trigonometry. In reality, stars are so far away that light rays from them are essentially parallel no matter where you are on earth (the sun and moon are closer and need a parallax correction, but this is a minor adjustment), so the difference in angle is due to the curvature of the earths surface. Understanding that the difference in angle is due to the curvature of the earth is so essential to understanding celestial navigation and why you need spherical trigonometry to solve this, I think the book does a disservice to the student by over simplifying it."
3,"Light, compact....but a little too, too...","This is an amazingly compact sleeping pad--really does compress and roll to the size of a half-liter bottle of water...But it's only 19 inches wide! No adult is that narrow...so, since it's inflated, you really notice when you ""fall off."" On the other hand, for a mature (read pushing 50 8-) adult with aspirations to back packing, this is the ideal item...perhaps bring two, and mate them? Alas, a little duct tape might do it! A well-made product--unusual in quality and weight.Beautiful product for what it is...an air mattress which compresses to the size and less weight that the average water bottle (for a bike.)"
4,Underrated,"Poorly recieved upon release due to a hopless marketing campaign that portrayed it as a comedy! One of Costner's best performances, lots of extremely entertaining pulp action and a fun sense of self irony from Russell. This one was clearly missed by the critics. Thank you very much."
4,Action Packed,great moving full on action...lots of guns and shooting! i like the vegas theme of the movie which made me like it even more! Viva Las Vegas!!
3,Awesome with Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell but Everybody Else...Eh.,"Viewed: 12/04, 3/06Rate: 53/06: 3,000 Miles to Graceland is an aggressive, thrilling violence machine but gets very boring after a while. The film works when the attention is on Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner but fails to be entertaining when it's directed on somebody else. I like the story and the cult feel of this film, and it works well to the taste of Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner. I am suffocated by the irritating appearances of David Arquette, Thomas Haden Church, the boy, John Lovitz, and Kevin Pollak. 3,000 Miles to Graceland...I am not sure if that's a good title. It doesn't make any sense. Perhaps it is too bad that the characters of Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell were wasted on worthless everything else in this film. So, 3,000 Miles to Graceland is a good ride for several reasons."
1,This Movie was goddamn AWFUL,"From the 3-D animated fighting heavy metal scorpions at the beginning to the gunslinging music video at the end, this film was the stupidest piece of cinema to be shat out onto American screens in a long time. Like originality in your films? Good dialogue? Characterization? Basic coherence of plot and structure? Yeah? Then stay away from this [film]. And how can a movie so bad be so long? 3000 hours to Graceland is more like it, or 3000 hours to the poor plot device they made up to give this thing a title. It begans dumb and cliched, and then gets worse and worse, snowballing more thin characters and weak plot coincidences and poorly staged action scenes until all the stupid characters meet up and blow each other away. And then Ice T shows up.Pretty damn funny, though.J"
3,f**k elvis.,"hollywood can't help but produce movies from a craphole. they try to make them all edgy and cool to attract a younger audience with a cheaper taste in films. i was actually excited to watch this movie at first. the storyline was somewhat interesting, so i ordered it from amazon. but i was heavily dissapointed. i ignored the cheasy opening scene with those 2 cgi scorpions... but that little kid was annoying as hell. i think him and the whole cheesy attempt at being cool killed the film. plus elvis is a joke. but i give it 3 stars for Ice T's cop-killin performance."
3,o.k movie,"I thought it was funny with the elvis look alikes, but I liked the scene most when Courtney Cox gets bunked on the bed."
3,Thank You! Thank You Very Much!,"This movie is an intoxicationg blend of violence, sex and gold lame. If you like alot of mayhem in your movies then this one is for you! Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner have given much better performances (which is hard to admit because I am a huge fan of Kurt Russells) but Courtney Cox gives a standout performance as the trashy, hoodlum raising Cybil Waingrow. I don't think this movie is a necessity for your DVD collection but Courtneys performance makes it worth the rental price alone!"
1,A steaming pile of dung,"I thought to myself, I'm going to ignore the critics on this one. I like Kevin Costner, I like Kurt Russell and guys robbing a casino dressed like Elvis sounds fun. Well, sometimes the critics get it right. This movie is, in a word, awful. Kurt Russell tries his best with his part, but he can only do so much with the horrible script he's given. Costner's part is written even worse and he chews scenery like he's channeling Pacino. There are bad edits, scenes that make no sense and have nothing to do with the plot (what plot there is), and violence just for the sake of violence, sex for the sake of sex and nothing has anything to do with storytelling. I don't know who the writer/director is but someone stop him before he makes another film."
5,Stunningly Good,"Wow! I watched 3000 Miles the other night and was shocked by how good it was. I would have thought that Tarantino filmed this one. At turns humorous and nasty, fun and funny, the movie keeps you guessing right up until the end.Its also nice to see Courtney Cox actually playing a sexy woman for a change, getting mean and doing the nasty. Interestingly, her husband has a cameo and is quickly killed off. That was worth the price of admission alone."
2,Hunka Hunka Burnin' Doody,"I imagine Elvis Presley alive somewhere in North Dakota, perhaps going in disguise to the video store, purchasing Frito's and a Surge Cola and renting this movie. He chuckles to himself and takes delight in seeing Kevin Coster appear in more putrid roles than Colonel Parker ever made him do. The movie hints that Costner was Presley's illlegitimate son, who knows, who cares. Ensemble casts are a great indication of a bad movie and this turkey delivers on all levels. All the characters (with the exception of Kurt Russell) are totally un-likeable, the plot is as thin and weak as a balsa wood airplane, and the characters that may have provided some comic relief were all killed off at the beginning of the movie. I see Elvis returning this DVD to the store 5 minutes before closing time, glad he is in disguise so that nobody will know that he rented this train-wreck of a movie."
3,Not a bad action film,"I wish I could give this 3.5 stars, but I can't give it 4. I love Kevin Cosner in this movie, but many of the actors didn't really do to great. I actually liked the story line about a group of guys dressed like Elvis who rob a casino with some awesome shoot 'em out sceens. The movie was very bloody so it's definatally not a movie I would let my kids watch, but for most adults this would be worth the watch. I would recommend this show as a good ONE TIME WATCH."
4,A dark drama/action film with an unusal buddy story in the back ground,"Like my title says this movie is dark, mostly due to Costner's character. Costner plays an evil bad guy very well. This bad guy is so uncaring about his actions and completely unpredictable. Russell plays the good guy that does illegal stuff like robbery but won't cross the line to the dark side where Costner's character lives. Both guys do their jobs well and show they are quality actors. The movie was good enough to buy it second hand and I will watch again over the years."
4,Let yourself be entertained - I like Costner as a bad guy,"This movie is one of those hardcore action movies that never slows down. They have three sex scenes (no nudity though), violence and language throughout. Hardly a fine cinematic endeavor, but I was entertained nonetheless. This was THE first time I've seen Kevin Costner as a vile, loathsome, foul-mouthed character - I liked it! He's usually too sensitive & perfect to be credible. I also can't remember when I last saw that much ammo expended. Another noteworthy aspect of the movie is the emphasis they put on the ""code of honor"" and grudging respect between cops and criminals - namely outlaws.Overall, 3000 Miles to Graceland is a must-see for all cops and robbers action fans."
1,What a stinker!,"I watched this on HBO in a hotel room. I almost went to the front desk to ask for my money back.What a awful movie! Definitely made for the short attention span, violence obsessed, completely brain-dead set. If that describes you, you will probably enjoy this movie. Otherwise, don't waste your time. If you want to see a good movie about a Vegas heist see Ocean's 11. If you want to see a good movie about Vegas, see Casino. If you want to watch stupid violence and waste two hours of your life, see this movie!"
1,As bad as it comes,"I was very excited to see this movie, but could not have been more disapointed. This movie doesn't know if its serious, funny, dark, dangerous, emotional or exciting... and as a result its none of the above. This movie may be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The action is fantastically ungripping, the dialoge is [poor], the plot is everchanging in its non-existance, and the ending is aweful. Save your money and two hours of your life by doing anything else except watching this piece of waste."
1,Pure Bunk.,"There is just nothing redeeming about this flick. I was so excited for it, too-- I haven't seen Kurt Russell in anything for a while. It started out good, and could have been a whole lot better, if only the director and screenwriter hadn't decided to flush it down the toilet. From the unnecessarily bloody slaying in Vegas to Ice-T flying through the air hanging by his feet, ""Graceland"" is a series of images that pop into a 14-year disturbed boy's head during an algebra test.Unless you're into drivel, skip it."
3,Thank You! Thank You Very Much!,"This movie is a intoxicating blend of voilence,sex and gold lame. If you like a lot of mayhem in your movies then this is for you! Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner have given much better performances (which is hard for me to say because I am a huge fan of Kurt Russells) but Courtney Cox Arquette lights up the screen! She gives a standout performance as the trashy, hoodlum raising Cybil Waingrow. This movie would make a fun rental but is not a necessity in your collection. It's worth at least one watch for Courtneys performence alone!"
1,Hated it,"Words cannot describe the agony I felt while watching this film.Hey, wait a second - it had a really cool trailer! That's what pulled me into seeing this mess'o'celluloid.So, buy it for the trailer."
4,Pretty Good Movie,"Even though this movie wasn't in theaters long, that does not reflect the great acting and story in this movie. Most people have all but written Keven Costner off, but this reaffirms his ability as a leading man. In probably one of his best roles he plays and Elvis worshipper who with his friend, Kurt Russell, conspire to knock off a casino. The heist goes as planned but Costner tries to off everyone on his team to keep the money for himself. Fortunatley Kurt Russell lives to hunt him down and try to take the money back.. The rest of the movie is a cat and mouse game between Costner, Russell, and the authorities. Hang on for the chase!"
4,"A great movie mindless entertainment 4 stars, reccomend","First this is not a drama. Second - it is very new in visual and style concept. You may like it or not, but it is very novel.3-d - they used Fujifilm instead of Kodak and they knew what they were doing - the image is very snappy and ripe.And 1-st again: it is pure entertainment, well done.The actors are a dynamite set and they perform exactly like they should in that movie. Russel is great and Coster is fantastically authentic. There are certain flaws in editing so I take one star off the 5 rating.You would not nominate this one for an Oscar yet will probably like it unless you are a movie critic or pretend you are one."
4,Watch with Low Expectations,"Wow, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by '3000 miles to graceland'. Sure, it can be violent at times but the action scenes are very cool and the plot is filled with twists and turns.Reading all these negative reviews, I almost didnt watch it. Goes to show you have to make up your own mind on these things."
1,"Boring, Stupid and Ridiculously Unrealistic","With the bulk of the better action sequences crammed into about 10 minutes in the beginning of the movie, the rest of this movie is about as interesting as watching the Garden Channel.Sold on trailers and previews as a movie ""about"" robbing a casino dressed as Elvis impersonators, instead they decide to rob it in the very beginning and skew the movie as something totally different. The movie is an average length of two hours, but feels like a 4 hour long journey from Vegas to Seattle, with bodies piling up about every hour just to make the audience think this terrible cinematic failure is ""fast-paced"". And there is a certainly a body pile up, since Kevin Costner kills a person in practically every shot he's in. ""Waterworld"" is more interesting than this movie, so maybe he should stick to making big-budget movies that don't make any money instead of moderate-high budget movies that don't make any money."
3,Good mindless entertainment,"I thought the movie was pretty good, really liked Kevin Costner's Mr. Mean Guy. I would consider this great mindless entertainment. Don't overevaluate, just go along for the ride."
3,Good Buttttt,"Good movie,but yet why did they have to put like a sence's like the kid is with the KC(Kurt Russell).They had to make all dramtic, but it's action packed im sure you will enjoy"
1,Watch a REAL John Woo film instead,"Heck, ""Black Arrow"" looks like ""Hard Boiled"" when compared to this film. How can you tell right off the bat that a movie is bad? 1st clue - Kurt Russell is in it. Even Goldie Hawn would'nt sit through this awful movie. 2nd clue - Kevin ""Postman"" Costner is in it. That is a warning sign that should NEVER be ignored. 3rd sign - it was directed by a bad music video director. There are so many good action flicks out, why subject yourself to this homage to ""Harley Daividson and The Marlboro Man""? Do your sanity a favor and take a pass on this one!"
1,"Nope, Not Quite Tarrantino","Costner, Russell, Ms. Arquette, and Lovitz have all been in better things. Why did they decide to work on this one is beyond logic. This highly unpleasant film is a wanna be Quentin Tarrantino clone. The story is very violent, with a few shots of humor, but no class."
3,25 Word Or Less Review,"Enjoyable, cutesy B-movie. Solid late night basic television viewing. Helps if you like Elvis and hate Costner. Pity the Elvi left so soon."
3,Nothing to do with Elvis,"The title of this movie is pretty misleading although you'll get the joke at the end. If you're expecting lots of Elvis related plot twists based on the movie's trailers, you'll be disappointed. There's a small portion of the movie that hints at some Elvis related plot twists but the film doesn't do anything with them, leaving you asking ""Why include them to begin with?""Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner are both pretty good and the beginning and ending action sequences of the movie are pretty entertaining. But the middle of the movie just becomes random and disorganized and prevents the plot from going anywhere.When I think about it, 3KMTG really is like most other action movies with some shootouts and some thrills and spills. Its entertaining but doesn't really stand out in my mind against similar action movies. I'm not a big Elvis fan but I was looking forward to more Elvis related plotlines.You may or may not like it. IT'll depend on how picky you are about action flicks."
2,Costner shlumps this one,"Costner is way over the top and his character is way annoying and I didnt like that about this movie. Kurt Russell's second Elvis film next to Elvis the TV movie which he played Elvis and that was better then this one. You also got some dumb supporters like Jon Lovitz, Ice-T, Dave Arquette, Bookem Woodbine and Christian Slater for god sakes(though I liked when Costner shot him dead, made him shut the hell up)Courtney Cox's character is like sexually active in this one"
1,This movie is feels like 3000 minutes!,"OK..this is the worst movie I've seen since Sand Lot. This is the last time my husband is allowed to pick a movie it was so bad :-) I really hated it! It was completely needlessley violent and appeared to be completely out of plot, so ""let's shoot our way through 2 hours and show blood flying everywhere!"" Also what it says is, it's OK to kill, steal, cheet,& lie and feel really good about it sailing off in the sunset. It really...! Don't buy it! In fact, don't even rent it or waste your time even if it's free ou on HBO."
1,Should be 3000 Hours to Graceland,"What a piece of crap. The main robbery scene was pretty cool and Costner did a nice job of being the heavy in this one. However Kurt Russell is his usual self and Courtney Cox (while HOT) did not show off any acting prowess.The plot was also horrific. The kid in the whole thing was just too much. This movie seemed to drag on and on and needed to stop about 40 minutes sooner. Terrible performances by Howie, Courtney and Kurt although we haven't seen him do a lot in the last 10 years anyway."
1,Why?,"Why do so many film directors these days feel obligated to follow the MTV music video style of direction? Why do so many films these days have chaotic music scores that have no central theme? Why do so many films these days have incomprehensible plots? Why do so many films these days waste good money and special effects on CGI titles that have nothing to do with the film? Why do aging actors like Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner feel that violent films that glorify criminal activity somehow guarantee boxoffice success? And last but not least, why does Courtney Cox think she can act?"
5,3000 miles of Rock 'n' Roll,Kurt Russell kick's ass in this great movie. I never get board of watching this movie. I give this movie A++Long Live the King
4,what are you on about?,"I can't believe why, or how, some people bag this one? I looked at the cover, saw the cast that included COX,KOSTNER and RUSSELL and thought ""hmmm,might work, might not"".From the scorpion fights at the start right through to the end, this movie was very entertaining. Ok, so it didn't show up the acting talents of the stars, but all were in it to have great fun, and I had fun watching them. I own heaps of DVD's and this one is in my top 30. Love it"
1,Please tell us a different story.,Please no more stories about a heist gone bad. And I am sick of every movie producer or director who thinks they can boost the production and artistic value of a picture by showing us scenes of Fremont St in Vegas. And how many times do we have to pay homage to Jim Thompson's the Getaway? Is there any writer out there who has a spark of originality?
1,What a fantastic actiozzzzzzzzzzzzz!!!,"Talk about bad. This movie flat out sucked. Kurt Russell as a good guy lead, I dont mind. But an over the top Kevin Costner as the bad guy just makes for bad movie watching. The plot is simple with some twists, but the movement of the movie is too slow and watching Kevin Costner in his god like elvis frame of mind was just irritating. Dont waste your time or money on this garbage."
2,Pretty Bad,This movie pretty much sucked. The only reason for two stars is I saw it on TV so I was able to stop the stupidity and bad acting at no cost.
1,Big Names ... Big Bust ...,"I had the misfortune of seeing this movie in the theatre. I was not sure when, but I would guess shortly into the movie (like 15 minutes) I was ready to leave. There is a lot of violence and shooting, but even that is not well done. It was one of the worst movies I have seen. The action scenes / violent scenes seemed to be not only a bit extreme, and I don't mean that it was too intense as much as out of place and overkill, but the plot was pretty poor as well. It just seemed that they were throwing a bunch of special effects (shootouts and explosions) and some big name actors /actresses at the movie and figuring that would be enough to carry the movie. It didn't work ... add this one to another Kevin Costner flop. Right up there with Waterworld!!"
3,Not Oceans 11: Costner doing the Terminator?,Kurt Russel and Courtney Cox do a pretty good job of making a bent love story out of a bloody gangster kill them all movie.The movie leaves you with the question:Who is the real Elvis illegitimate kid?The actual big winner here may be this kid actor who plays Courtney Cox's boy who steals everything he lays hands on as he also steals a lot of the scenes.
3,Hit&Miss Film,this film is interesting in different spots but like so many films out nowadays it starts off way too slow&the pacing takes a while to catch on.the Film never holds up well enough for me all the way.Costner does a Decent job in it.but overall this is a Basic Rental not a Repeat watching.
5,Decent film you might find something you like in it,"I saw elements of ""Out of Sight"" and ""Honeymoon in Vegas"" in this action movie. The film deals with a heist pulled off by thieves posing as Elvis impersonators during a convention, and their following dillemas afterwards. The film becomes fairly predictable and unbelivable in the ensuing chaos, as most of the action takes place in showdowns between Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner's character."
2,"Good performances, poor direction","The first 1/3 of this movie was really good. Some great action scenes, great chemistry between all involved..... and then all of a sudden, most of the cast is killed off and what we are left with is; Kurt Russell and a child actor who really never work, a relationship with Coutney Cox that was never believable, hot potatoe with a bag of money, and Kevin Costner in a Wombat suit. How is that for a mental image?This could have been a great movie if they would have done the following; take more time with the build up to the actual ""heist"". Since that was the highlight, to have it happen within the first 20 mintues leaves the rest of the movie gasping for air. By doing this it would have given more screen time to ""the crew of Elvis's"" plus given the audience more of a shock when Costner goes renegade.All the pieces were in place for this movie, it could have been great but as it stands, it's just another in a long line of almosts."
3,something to be said for low expectations,"I hadn't heard one good thing about this movie, so I had nothing to be disappointed about in this movie's silliness. Just sit back and enjoy. Kevin Costner was HILARIOUS as the bad guy. If you're in a ludicrous movie, be ludicirous...why not? Kudos to him, and I can't stand Kevin Costner. The standoff scene with the highway cop was my favorite."
2,Low grade action--semi typical storyline,"I was expecting a more mysterious movie, but in the end this movie was just a collection of cheap lines and impossible situations. If not for the cool cars, the cool sideburns and the gorgeous Cybil, I would have given it one star. It is really a pretty mindless movie not to mention quite impossible. I also believe that Kevin Costner really had to 'stretch' his acting efforts to play this character. Kurt Russel on the other hand does a fine job as his role is well suited to him.I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
4,A wonderful treat after 30+ years.,"If you grew up in the 1960s, and remember being blown away by The Music Machine's single TALK TALK, this CD is welcome and a real treat. Many of the completely underrated and almost totally overlooked Sean Bonniwell songs are real gems. This compilation is a road map to how the band got its start and also shows where it tried to go, but lack of commercial success doomed the band. HOT here are an early, rawer version of the powerful TALK ME DOWN, the politicially-sharp and awesome rockers CITIZEN FEAR and POINT OF NO RETURN, the never before heard WORRY, which is in full bloom on the 2-part, longer CD version, the Beatles-flavored TWO MUCH, and the strong, thoughtful ballad CHANCES. Get this one. Bonniwell and the MUSIC MACHINE were rocknroll genius at work."
1,"Short and boring - I felt cheated,","Lynn sets all her stories in Australia which is refreshing. But her stories are short and just like her book 'Gold Fever' the story needed more! More scenes between the characters, more love scenes, more interaction.""Fliss comes out and everybody is happy"" - I wish!I don't understand why her books are so short. Is the publisher forcing her to push them out quickly?Most authors grow and expand in their writing I didn't feel this was the case here. I doubt I will buy anymore of her books."
2,This is EZ lo-fi sigh,"Pop master, singer/songwriter, historianall thatBUT! does that have to mean poorly recorded? Does the love of '50's rock 45s '60's punk '70's new wave mean fuzzy background and needle stuck grit? Let the song out! Let the vocals shout/whisper as should be.Marshall Crenshaw is perhaps the finest singer/songerwrite with the worst production ever. WAIT! look at the producers; T-Bone Burnett Steve Lilywhite Alan Betrock etc.. are ya kidding me? This is as muddy as boot-steppin after a hurricaine in LA swamps;meaning both L.A. tar pits and Louisiana gator pits.Live, Marshall jumps and beats back the recordings. Do that instead."
1,overrated,"This album is touted as a 5 star compilation, and the jacket notes wonder why Marshall Crenshaw never achieved the great status he deserves. I wonder why he got the praise he did get. 3 words describe this album- bubble gum pop. Like bubble gum, after the first couple of songs you are left with a toothache and the flavor becomes dull. It is not surprising to me why Crenshaw never made it big outside of elevators. This is syrupy music that dulls the senses. I feel cheated and mislead by the other reviews listed here. Listen to samples before you buy this incredibly dull, sleep-inducing album- you may well want to save your money. I wish I had."
5,22 great songs,"Crenshaw's been writing and recording great pop/rock music for so long and has gotten so little press and radio airplay that when you hear the songs on this compilation, if you're hearing them for the first time, you'll feel that you've been let in on this cool secret music club. His songs are kind of a combination of rockabilly, Beatles, soul, and jangle, and every tune on this compilation is over too soon.Even if you already have his CDs or albums, this CD collects his best songs and adds a couple you might not have (Something's Gonna Happen, You're My Favorite Waste of Time). The remastering sounds great, the programming is chronological (though it doesn't really matter because these songs are pretty timeless), and Crenshaw's contributions to the liner notes are fun to read."
4,Almost perfect,"This is two songs short of being a fantasy compilation. ""Whatever Way the Wind Blows"" (a Crenshaw original) would have been much better in the place of the no-big-deal John Hiatt cover (""Someplace Where Love Can't Find Me"") and ""Fantastic Planet of Love"" should have been included in place of ""Better Back Off."" Too bad."
5,So cute:),i love this case it's so cute and very feminine...and it's so small i can take it anywhere like holding a purse...i love it for long lines at the bank...just pull out my ds and play:)
5,Great book for kids and parents to share,"My daughter picked this book out herself in the bookstore because she was attracted to the colorful cover with all the Sesame Street gang. Since then, she asks me to read it to her all the time. She loves turning the pages and finding the different illustrations and styles on each page. She loves reading this book more than watching the show! This way, she can skip to the parts she likes the best. I can't wait for the publishers to publish some more editions! I will definately buy more in the series."
1,Too much text for reading aloud.,"Ms. nearly-2 is a big Sesame Street fan,and likes the pictures. But there is too much text on each page for reading out loud - she gets impatient before I can finish the page. Probably this book will be good when her attention span is a few years older."
4,Incompatible worlds: faith and atheism,"This was a very interesting and quick read. The book is set somewhere like Mallorca but not Mallorca at a time similar to when the Inquisition was at the height of its zealousness. The story is about an atheist, who after a shipwreck, finds himself stranded in an island where lack of belief is paramount to a hideous crime. The characters are well developed and the discussions which the characters have are believable (a rationalist at a similar time could have similar discussions with believers). These discussions are still relevant today and thought provoking. This is a provocative novel which depicts incompatible worlds: the world in which people can be good without faith and the world where faith is the only good. The protagonist is likable, though perhaps a bit too optimistic. Over all, I recommend this book to those interested in debates about faith, to those interest in atheism. Lastly, the book is a warning to the pernicious effects that blind faith has."
4,Faith and reason,"An excellent book about faith and reason, and what it means to be human. Imaginative, yet philosophically and theologically tight."
5,"A must read for religious, atheist & agnostic alike.","Walsh's skilful writing is such that the reader is left wondering whether the book advocates the integrity of atheism as a viable response or whether a faith beyond reason's reach is an appropriate response for a believer. It is a book that can be read by believer and atheist alike and provide both food for thought. It would be interesting to know Walsh's personal view on the question of religion and atheism. If atheist, then this book is, I would suggest, the atheist answer to other greats of religious fiction such as C S Lewis, The Narnian Chronicles. If religious, then Walsh probes the religious reader with unsettling and critical questions."
3,Knowledge of Angels,"Our book club review. Most of us liked it. The characters could have been filled out a little more. The style of writing was very good, some of the arguments were well thought out and worth reading again. It made us think about respecting principles and beliefs of others and of the benefits of education."
3,"Good novel, poor philosophy","I have always been fascinated by novels of ideas. I do not think that putting ideas into a narrative is easy and ""Knowledge of Angels"" is successful in bringing back to life the lively debates of the Medieval theologians. However, when it comes to philosophy the story is weak. It builds on a now somewhat outdated Enlightenment idea of Reason being natural and self-sufficient. Here we have a Prince who comes from an unknown place (a sort of rationalist Utopia of the 18th century) and ends up disputing with Medieval scholars. It is as unbelievable as a story where Plato is tele-transported to the British Library in the 19th century to have a discussion with Karl Marx. On the whole, however, I recommend the book as it is well-written and a good read"
5,Philosophically stimulating...it may change your life!,"As an A-level student studying this novel for my English Lit qualification, I read this book with a degree of suspicion. Afterall, why should I study a book about religion when I could have done an RE A-level? After the first few chapters, however, I realised the actual gravity and social importance this book can play in our post-millenium society. The actual theological content will have you thinking about the role an omnicsient force and play in our life, and may even lead you to question your very own moral code. The allorgorical ties were also very stimulationg, as was the attractive narrative of Amara - the wolf-child. Paton-Walsh gives her characters such an intellectual and ethical grounding that we don't even realise the sometimes damning consequence of their actions. So, if you want a severe moral stimulation, coupled with the lush imagery Walsh is so highly regarded for, then buy this book!"
3,they are just OK speakers,"if you are looking for an OK speaker, you may wanna consider this logitech. im not a picky person and dont know nothing about sound and stuff but the sound is sketchy when i turn up the volume just a bit and hear the static noise when no music is playing."
1,No happy dancing,I bought this set of speakers and loved the sound I was doing the happy dance for about a month when they suddenly stopped powering on. I contacted Amazon and they replaced them right away which made me do the happy dance again until I plugged them in and they would not power on either. So I have had 2 sets and both were broken. I am not sure what the odds are for that but I am no longer doing the happy dance.
2,Low-quality low-end speakers.,"These speakers look fine upon installation, but the sound quality can only be called pathetic. The static noise is constantly in the background. The treble is weak and inaccurate. The adapter does not work with iPod Touch. About the only redeeming feature is the loud bass. Unfortunately, I am a classical music guy, so the bass is quite irrelevant to me.In short, a good option for heavy metal fans, especially those who are hard on hearing already. Otherwise, one should avoid it like plague."
2,You get what you pay for.,"Well, these speakers are cheap, no doubt about it. And they do work. But that's about it in terms of positives.They really sound lousy. They sound like you took a pair of decent speakers and smothered them with a pillow. The sound is very muffled. No highs, no punch or presence whatsoever. They are also very underpowered.I think this was a penny-wise and pound-foolish purchase. If I had it to do over again, I'd spend some more money and buy something that sounded decent. I recently bought a set of Klipsch 2.1 speakers for another computer that were twice as expensive but sounded great.Don't buy these unless you are really pinched for cash."
2,It all depends,"Well,Lets say this. If this is all you can afford, then get them. Not bad for the money. However, if you are really an audiophile then these are NOT FOR YOU!!!Sound delivery was not manageable even with a equalizer. Again, if you just need sound to come from the computer...then these are for you. If you want TRUE SOUND..the way that your ear is meant to hear it...spend a few more dollars and get something better."
5,PC Speakers,"Very nice sound. The remote on-off switch is a great feature. Great value for the money! You should know that the IPOD/ZUNE/MP3 dock isn't really a dock in the sense you think it is. It is just a place to mount your IPOD's PC conector cable. I was planning on putting these speakers on a shelf and docking my Zune to it. But it doesn't work quite that way. You can do it using the 1/8 inch jack, but not the ""dock"" like you think you can. That's because these are really PC speakers. No big deal. But I use them as ""stand-alone"" speakers using the 1/8 inch jack. It works and sounds great for the price."
4,Good for Money,"This was a good deal for the price. The ipod dock part is pretty lame, but the cable has a good reach so whatever you are importing sound from does not necessarily need to be right next to the speakers."
3,Logitech 970285-0403 X-240 2.1 Speakers (Black),"These are not the best speakers, but they are very good for the $[...] bucks I spent on them. If you are looking for speakers to listen to music on, then I would look for different speakers. If you are looking for everyday speakers just to browse the internet they are great."
2,Constantly picks up radio frequencies,"The sound these speakers put out is pretty decent for the price, though nothing special. The real problem, however, is feedback. Not only are there loud pops and clicks, but they constantly pick up radio frequencies. As long as the speakers are on and the volume is low, you will hear various radio broadcasts in myriad languages (sometimes more than one at a time), and if you turn the volume up to avoid this, you get the pops and clicks. The voices made me curious at first, then it was kind of amusing. Now it's flat out annoying. This seems to be a frequent problem with Logitech speakers in general, not just this model. The Mp3 player dock is certainly nice, but does not outweigh the annoyance of the incessant feedback. Even for such a low price, these speakers are not worth it."
2,Good & Bad,"I Purchased Logitech X-240 2.1 Speakers, They sound Great but it also has a Mp3 Docking Port Wich in the Advertisement say it fits all Mp3 Players, Not So!"
4,Great product at a great price!,Great for a dorm room. I use it for my dorm and its more than enough to get the music banging. Great price. I havent seen a better price/product combo.
4,Very good for the money,"We purchased these speakers as an upgrade to the anemic speakers on our Sharp LCD TV. And what an upgrade! You just don't realize what you're missing until you hear it. Deep, fairly powerful bass, that doesn't get muddy. Crisp, clean, bright highs that never really sound tinny or jangly. Obviously, for this kind of money, not the best I've ever heard, but very good nonetheless. The only reason why I dinged it 1 star was the awkwardness of the MP3 connector setup. Very fiddly and cumbersome, though the sound quality was consistent."
5,Great speaker system for ipods,"I bought this for my daughter and she uses it all the time, it has great sound and is so easy to use."
4,Clear Sound!,"Even though this is only a 2.1 system, the subwoofer is pure and the two front speakers are very crisp. The setup was 95% easier than i had anticipated. I'm no sound expert, but wow. I think anyone would be able to find true satisfaction with this set.The ipod-port is a pretty neat add on! All ipods and mp3 players should work since it operates thru headphone jack.4 out of 5 stars ONLY because you cant control the volume when you have headphone on. Otherwise, TOTAL SATISFACTION."
2,X-240 Sattilite and Subwoofer...,"Disappointed. From the looks here I thought I'd be giving my 20-year old panasonic small reference speakers a run for their money; but unfortunately,no matter how I configured the pc's sound card settings w/window media player etc. - the sound from these X-240 satellites and subwoofer was...just plain bad. And the sub control itself is wack. At least mine was. Volume control dial is cheap. Other logitech 2.1 sets I've heard sounded good though, just not this here one."
4,Pretty Sweet!!!,"Good full sound...no hum at all. Nice balanced subwoofer. Very happy, My Linux box now has some bass!"
4,Feels Like War,"This product is great, especially if you are just into getting a basic sound system for your computer. Easy to hook up, multiple accessories(iPod/Mp3 player holder), and sounds great. I have watched multiple action films on this computer using the sound system and I feel like I am really there. I have watch real battle footage from Iraq on the internet, and put the volume up to see how ""realistic"" it sounded, obviously no bullet were whizzing by my head but the sound was impeccable. The small arms fire to the mortar rounds, to the low bass of the .50 cal. Very nice."
3,"Sound good, bad cable management.","Sound is good, though I have a set of Altec Lansing ALS44's from about 2001 that sound as good if not better.The ""dock control center"" is really just a power button and dial volume control on a ""dock shaped"" thing-a-ma-jig. The left and right speakers are hard wired to each other via the plug, the dock is hard wired to the subwoofer, etc. It was impossible to run the cables where I wanted to because of this.These are my first ""slightly more than basic speakers"" from Logitech, and likely my last. Though the sound quality is decent, the cable management options really frosted me."
2,"Cheap price, cheap sound","I'm not any kind of speaker expert, but these were fuzzy and won't play with any volume. I put in an audio card which helped slightly on the quality of the sound, but they are still pretty soft. I will probably buy some better speakers."
4,Nice Speakers....Normal sound,Easy to install and good for normal sound..cant expect too much from these ones at this price..Cheers
4,Easy to use,Product was ready to go out of the box. If you looking for an inexpensive and easy to use produt this is a sure bet.
3,Good Speakers for low price,"These are personal speakers, that is, they will not fill a room with sound but a small area in front of the PC. (Which is what I was looking for.) The cables between the volume unit and the sub-woofer are directly attached and cannot be replaced. (This is bad if the cable breaks, or you want to use different lengths.)At high volumes the small top speakers start clipping.So, the short of it, if your need is small personal speakers which to listen to music, or games at medium volumes, this is an ideal low cost solution. However, I may already have to upgrade because I would like better sound at higher volumes."
4,Good system for my desk,"It's a nice system. It hooks up easily with mp3/walkman/computer. There is some static noise that's a bit annoying though, otherwise can't complain."
3,"Great style, decent sound","This speaker set is indeed a sleek looking, fine sounding option for listening to music on computer. The sound isn't as rich as the $30 Harmon Kardon's I got with my standard issue Dell desktop in 1999 which finally gave out this summer, but it is adequate. I may need to play with the settings on my computer, perhaps, but I was surprised that in 8 years the sound quality couldn't be somewhat more improved."
2,Poor cabling quality!,"The sound is good, however I struggled since day one with the volume device and how it affected the sound. Half of the time the right speaker will not sound and there is a constant buzz that is difficult to take away. Really poor quality. I am very disappointed."
3,They're just powered speakers.,"Speakers sound fine, but I was disappointed by the iPod ""bracket."" It's just a stand and does not charge your iPod, which is what I was looking for. Had to buy that separately."
3,Not That Great,"I got these to replace an older set of Creative MZ0005 (I paid about $[...] bucks for them several years ago). When I first set up this set I thought it was OK but definitely wasn't impressed. I then alternated between listening from this set and my old set and the difference was huge. These speakers had far less range. It's probably because these only have one driver per speaker (my old ones have two - one for treble, one for mid-range). I ended up returning these speakers."
2,Underwhelming,Wow - not impressed at all. I guess you truly get what you pay for. These produce a really shallow sound that's either tingy or over-bassed (depending on your bass volume setting). After 15 min. trying the bass volume at different settings I just couldn't find one that was acceptable. Something about the sound of these speakers irritates the crap out of me! I'll probably return them and upgrade. If you're going to use them a lot for music and movies - i highly recommend throwing down some extra bucks - I'm returning these!FYI: the ipod holder?? are you kidding me logitech? that is the cheesiest gimmick i've seen - can't believe you even wasted your time producing that flimsy POS.
1,Does not work any longer,I loved the sound when I first got it. I am very disappointed as I haven't used it in a couple months and now there is nothing. I thought spending more for these that it would last a long time as I only use it when I get emails that require volume.How do I get it replaced AMazon?
3,Pleasing sound for the price but annoying background hum,"These produce a pleasing sound (may require playing with equalizer settings to get adequate mid-range) but if electronic humming noises bother you these will drive you nuts.I find I must power them off when not actively using them as the hum is distracting. While listening to music the hum isn't noticeable. Other reviewers have noted this so I don't think it's a defect with mine; it's a design flaw.The extra ""ipod dock"" is a silly design. Too light weight to stay standing up. When looking for the volume or power control (on the side of the dock), the 3rd device on the desk gets overlooked by people searching for the volume control.I got a pair of altec lansing vs2521 speakers for my wife's notebook that I like better."
4,Great value for the price,"Plug it in, connect to your computer or MP3 player, turn it on - decent quality sound comes out, and that was all I was looking for. It doesn't take up much room on the desktop, the cables are long enough to allow me to place all the components in convenient places, and the sound quality is good enough for me (at age 61, my hearing may not allow me to notice any sonic shortcomings).My only comment is the cheesy MP3 player ""holder"" on the control unit. It's not a real dock, it's a little platform that you can rest the player on, and there are little adapters that let you attach the player cable so the player can charge or sync while it's sitting on the platform. You'll need to plug the speakers into the player's headphone jack. At this price point, perhaps a real dock isn't possible."
3,ehhhh okay,so i rated this 3 stars because it honestly is okay as like laptop speakers but no if you wanna jamm to itultra loud then the sound gets really choppy but theres a way to get around it and is by buying a lil cord like the green tipone but better.. but overall if i were you i wouldnt get it if you love playing your music loud but if you just want it to watch moviesor to listen to medium volumed medium sure this is okay. id look at another one or maybe even go to bestbuy and try it outthen hop on amazon and get it a few bucks cheaper=) enjoy
2,They hum!,"They are going back.- speakers they hum whenever turned on, even at the lowest volume.- the remote control is hardwired into the subwoofer. Remote is big enough and I can't push it into the opening for cables at the back of the desk."
1,If you like interference...,"These speakers are incredibly good at receiving interference. If you like hearing fuzzy local radio stations mixed over your signal, this is for you."
1,Buzzz,These speakers are horrible because of the constant buzzing sound they emit. If you turn up thye music loud enough though they sound good. I will be replacing these with a better set of speakers. Probably Monsoon.
1,Pass.,"Bought this set at Fry's today. Plugged them in and got a terrible hum sound from the sub. Played with volume, plugged in the sound jack, unplugged, tried a different power plug in the house - still had the hum. I've read other reviews on the web that reported the same problem. Logitech missed the mark on these. I'm returning the set tomorrow. I recommend you look for a different solution, too."
2,Logitech X-240 Speakers End Up Not As Good As Said To Be,"The X-240 Logitech Speakers were reviewed and said to be great speakers over-all. So, I bought these after reading many reviews and listening too them at a store. After 2 days of having them in use, they started having problems. They started to pick up radio stations- VERY annoying. Also- they make a popping sound when there is a surge in the house power. So, other than these two main problems- which are Big issues- at least the radio station interference is, they are so-so speakers- in terms of sound quality.In summary, I would not recommend these. I also had problems after purchasing them and trying to return under warranty to Logitech. What a run around and headache with that Co. !!"
2,Hum is very annoying,"These wouldn't be bad speakers if it weren't for the hum that the subwoofer emits as soon as it is plugged in, whether or not it is hooked up to the computer. I would not recommend this set."
5,great sound!,Logitech X-240 2.1 Speakersjust opened my item and tested it ohhhh love the great sound! its nice coz it has a mp3 player cradle. just attach your ipod and start listening to your fav music! the black finish and design complements my hp desktop. and its really easy to assemble i did it in a breeze. i couldnt ask for more.....
4,Nice,"the speakers sound amazing for how cheap they are. there is sometimes a bit of static that comes from them, but it usually lasts a minute or less and then goes away. i'm not sure why they do this, but other than that, the speakers are great."
3,They're okay,"These speakers are just mediocre. The bass is AWESOME!!! (for the price anyway) Despite the awesome bass, however, the desktop speakers sound muffled. This may be because of my sound settings, but I think I would like them a little more if they sounded tinny rather than muffled. But, of course, I really like treble so that might be why.Pros:The bass is AWESOME for the price.Even with the control unit, they take up very little desk real estate which is really nice.They look very nice on the desk. Style is really nice. Even though they are tall and skinny, they are really pretty stable standing up (i.e. not as easy to tip over as some speakers I've had.Cons:Small speakers sound very muffled (hopefully this is just a setting that I can change on my puter somewhere.Overall, for the price, they're not bad. I'm just not as impressed as I thought I would be based on other reviews. (again, if I can find a setting to turn up the treble a bit or something, perhaps I'll enjoy them even more)."
2,ehhh...,"this seems like it should be the best thing in the world..maybe if you buy it new, but i don't know. i bought used and left channel doesn't work, volume control doesn't work very well(scratchy and poor control) mp3 dock kinda nice but not a dock like i thought it was going to be. its just a place to set it on and then run a 3.5mm aux cable. the woofer really drops bass notes nice though. like i said earlier, ehhhhh"
1,these speakers SUCK,"whatever you do, don't buy these. cannot handle any music with out breaking up. total waste of money"
4,every time,"every time I listen to it Ilove it. dramatic, produced wonderfully, a step above the ex-bands , not a bad song. buy it, i promise"
3,18 inch HDMI cable,This cable does what it is supposed to do. It is short and was a reasonably inexpensive cable for a rebuild
3,A BETTER LIFE PART 2,"In Fatou: An African Girl in Harlem readers learn that Fatou is a very strong person who could be mean. Believe it or not she has a soft spot in her heart and even through all of the cruelty she faced, she was able to forgive. But would she ever forget the past?While dealing with drama, Fatou is trying to maintain her empire. Fatou: An African Girl in Harlem could have had a more explosive ending to hype readers up for book #2."
5,The Best,"This is a very good compilation of JGWs funk work. It is ideal for anyone who wants the best of his various funk albums. There is a lot of humour in his lyrics, underpinned by some very tight and funky grooves, laced with lots of blues and jazz guitar licks. Excellent liner notes on an extensive inside folder with colour photographs. This is an all time favourite for me. I highly recommend it."
5,Funk Beyond the Call of Duty,"I'm gonna keep it brief and let Johnny do the talkin'. Don't hesitate, this is a must have. Some people might look at this dude as some kind of gimmick, but I'm here to say JGW is for real. Funny, passionate, creative, the man lives up to the name ""Guitar"" and so much more. His live performance in Bremen, Germany (1977) on YouTube is also a great introduction."
2,good electric trimmer,"Bought this as a replacement for the exact same model - we liked the first enough to skip right to it. light, powerful,easy to use (auto advance feature nice), inexpensive... just make sure you wear long pants..."
5,BEST TRIMMER EVER,"THIS IS THE BEST TRIMMER EVER. NO NEED TO TAP. YOU GET THE JOB DONE IN NO TIME. ONE COMMENT FOR BETTER OPERATION. WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF STRING, MAKE SURE YOU WIND NEW STRING VERY TIGHT AND NEATLY. OTHER WISE THE TRIMMER WONT WORK PROPERLY."
2,2 stars is generousFirst,"This trimmer functioned exactly twice for me. While the "" no bump "" feature sounded like a good option, it was really slow to advance the string. But I was getting a good cut, so I kept going. That is until the machine completely stopped. No amount of cleaning, or rewinding the stringcould bring this thing back to life. I never even used up the spool of string which came with the trimmer. Fortunately, I have been offered a full refund which I will take advantage of. Don't waste your time with this trimmer. Sadly this lack of quality seems all too prevalent with Black & Decker home products. So why 2 stars ?? Well, when it worked it did the job."
1,Inexpensive and Cheap,"Used this trimmer 10 or so times, and the first time I replaced the spool line, t6he motor gave and had to get a new one. I did like it when it was working, enjoyed the swiveing head adjustment, but quality lacks."
4,great product,"Once you get the hang of it the product works just fine as both an edger and a trimmer. Pretty versatile and helped me edge the concrete pathway and trim near the walls and fence which are spots that are hard to get a mower near.Pros:- Lightweight- Very effective and helps with heavy edging/trimming operations- Easy assembly/operation/conversion from edger to trimmerCons:- Poor power cord retention. Cord keeps getting pulled out- Edging works best in one direction, edging in reverse direction casues the mudguard (black shield at bottom) to work loose- Limited instruction on use and you need to experiment a bit to figure out how to use it as an edger"
5,Gets the job done,"Only once before did I even have a weed wacker and it was a piece of junk. I didn't realize that not all of them were like that. Due to a lot of rain, broken lawn mower and my work schedule, my yard was awful. I bought this baby and a new mower and went to work. I couldn't believe how quickly it did its job. It is almost fun to do yard work with it. I did find out I need to be more careful though. The first time I used it, it took out a small chunk of my house siding on a corner. My fault, I got too close and underestimated its power."
4,A great trimmer/edger for the price... BUT,"My experience is that this Auto Feed trimmer IS indeed a string hungry monster. I would have given it 5 stars otherwise. Fortunately, hand winding a reload is a fairly fast & simple proposition. I cannot recommend highly enough to buy the largest roll (for economy) of bulk string refill you can find. The reason I probably gobble more string than some other reviewers is because I do use it as designed, to edge along concrete as well as clear flora from along the foundation of my house. This brute actually breaks up loose cement with a loud ""Ka-chunk!"" (there goes a bunch of line) and keeps on whacking, so for heavy-duty operations it does garner the 5th star. Maybe with more experience I'll edge precisely and never hit the concrete at all - but in the mean time it's winding and whacking (and relaxing and admiring). I now have the best looking driveway, sidewalks & curb on my street."
2,Line Hog,"I bought this trimmer/edger thinking how great it would be to just trim with the auto-feed feature. I have had the most difficult time with this trimmer. I used over 75 feet of line in an area smaller than 250 sq. ft. of mainly grass and some weeds. After using the spool that came with it which lasted 10 minutes, I constantly had to stop to re-wind the spool (yes, I read the directions and did it properly - 5 times). It continuously cut off pieces of line and threw them close to 100 ft. through the air. This is not safe in a California neighborhood. I would not recommend this trimmer unless you like fiddling with your trimmer."
3,B&D Trimmer/Edger,"The package arrived quickly, although I was surprised to find just the item--no packing material whatsover. It wasn't difficult to attach the one loose part, but as yet I haven't been able to use the trimmer. I'm not sure if the problem is with the trimmer or with the outside electrical outlet, but I haven't been able to get the trimmer to turn on."
5,FINALIST FOR THE 2000 GREAT LAKES BOOK AWARD!,"The poetry in this edition is especially strong this year, butdon't miss the short stories! The next Voices of Michigan mightpossibly be a children's volume..."
3,good enough,"The canisters aren't very thick nor heavy so I don't really think it will last a very long time. It's not really airtight as well. Dropping them would certainly cause some dents. Stainless steel looks good and the design of these canisters make them look good on top of any kitchen counter and for the price, they are good enough!"
4,Overall Nice Band,"The shipping was very quick. The band was pretty nice for the price, however when I compared this with a 6mm band from a jewelry store it was not quite as thick. But overall it is a nice band."
4,Very nice.,"My husband loves this ring. He says it's very comfortable. The sizing isn't to accurate though. It was off by I think 1/4 which was just enough for the ring not to fit. We had it sized rather than return it. This was the second time I had to buy the ring. The first time they sent me a size 12! I had to return it & buy another ring & wait for my money to be refunded. VERY frustrating. I didn't want to have to do the return/buy thing again, that why we just went & had it sized. I figured it would be easier that way. Besides, what if they sent the wrong size yet again? BUT, it is an attractive ring. My husband wears it every day & never takes it off, unlike his old ring. The end result was what we wanted despite the initial headaches. If if wasn't for all the sizing issues I would have given it 5 stars."
3,Looks great and is worth the money,The ring looks good and is definitely worth the money. The ring is not that comfortable but you get used to it. It is slightly thinner than 6mm but hardly noticeable. It looks great though! You wont find anything better for the price. A good buy.
1,not quite,"I received the ring in only 2 short days ... fantastic. However the ring was advertised as 6mm, and falls a full .5mm shy of the 6mm band I'm currently wearing."
1,hazardous?,"A search just now of Cosmeticsdatabase (if they can be believed; but they do seem diligent) seems to list this product or a similar product as ""Moderately Hazardous"": the listing at that dot-com is:""Curel Daily Moisture Therapy Lotion, Original Formula"".(You too can go there and do the search.)In contrast, some other skin lotions being sold on Amazon seem better: they are listed in Cosmeticsdatabase as merely ""Low Hazard""."
3,replacement,"Replacement for the origonal which the threads stripped out. Good price (cheeper than new crankset) Riden by 6'4"" 260lb rider."
3,DOESN'T DESERVE NEWBERRY HONOR !!!!!!!,This book was not up to Sharon Creech's usual standards. The book was boring and silly. I hope her next book is better. Walk two Moons is fantastic though.
3,Good for Younger Readers,"I read this book when it came out when I was in fourth grade or so. I liked it then, but that was probably because I was a total bookworm.""The Wanderer"" is basically a little kid book, in a sense. Anyone under the age of twelve will enjoy it. After that, all of us in high school and up can only read about a page of it before coming to the conclusion that Sophie is psychotic and suffers from PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder).Sophie's nearly insane babblings can get quite annoying after awhile, and the whole Bompie thing was a little too drawn out. The word ""pie"" was used far too frequently throughout this book.In short, I would only recommend this book to a primary-school-aged girl that likes to read longer books. (It's really not a guy book.)"
4,"Not as good as Sharon Creech's others, but good nonetheless","This book was a disappointment after others such as Walk Two Moons, Bloomability, and Chasing Redbird, but it still draws you in and is a story worth having."
1,"No likey, no likey, no likey","THE WANDERER ... is very similar to the author's WALK TWO MOONS. If you like Creech's style, which tends to be a bit cutesy, then you'll like this book too. If you don't, stop reading here.Sophie is meant to be humorous and quirky and sensitive, but she simply comes across as annoying. Her cousin Cody is uncomfortably odd -- it's not clear what his age is at all -- but at least he's more likable.The storm in the middle is the best part. The rest is filler."
5,The Wander: A great book,"""The sea, the sea, the sea. It rolled and rolled and called to me. Come in, it said, come in."" At the beginning of this story six passengers are about to start a paralizing journey. They will face fears and life in ways they would have never imagined.The six crew members of the boat, The Wanderer, are all facing their own personal problems. At first, no one will get along. When they head out to sea they have to learn to be alert and to watch out for each other.Sophie and Cody are two members on the wanderer. This book consists of their diary entries. This book shows their personal views on things that go on, on and off the boat. Sophie and Cody learn to get along together. They get to know each other inside and out.When I read this book I was whisked away into the life of these two characters. Sharon Creech created a lifelike tale that will realate to peoples lives. I highly recomend this book to any readers who like to be sucked from your world into another person's life."
4,Waves and the Sea,"An orphan named Sophie, her two cousins, and two uncles sail on a journey and face many challenges on the way in ""The Wanderer"". Wanting to see her grandfather, she rides with them, not to mention she loves sailing. Across the ocean is a long way and will take a lot of time. So why not try to get better acquainted? Each of them searches deep inside and finds their talent, trying to teach or tell the others how. Sophie knows so much about boats, and everyone thinks she doesn't because she's just a little kid. Sophie couldn't ignore the sea: the calling waves, the wind in your ears. Sharon Creech's style of writing captured many people's imagination because she wrote this very vividly. It captured mine and kept me enjoying reading The Wanderer. The Wanderer won the Newberry Honor Award medal and makes you feel sad toward the end. Creech's daughter actually journeyed across the ocean and inspired this story. It is a great book for all ages."
4,Good Book,"The Wanderer by Sharon Creech. It was about a girl who wants to go on a boat ride with her uncle. So finally he says yes. On the boat was her cousin Cody, Brian, Uncle Stew, Uncle Dock, and Sophie. Sophie is a girl who is spontaneous, and outgoing. She is willing to do anything on the boat to make sure they survive. Brian is her cousin who is a control freak and his father Uncle Stew is the same exact way. Cody is her other cousin who just does what ever he wants to do. Uncle Dock is Cody's father and he likes to paint and doesn't get along with Cody or anyone on the boat. The boat ride was pretty scary, a few big waves aboard, rainy weather and they lost their only radio. They finally made it to there grandfather, who lived in England."
4,so so,"There were really deataled discriptions about the journey, you felt like you were on the Wanderer, but the end of the book sort of disapointed me"
1,the wanderer,"i thought that this book sucked so badly. Why cant you write something that is interesting. sharon creech,you need to stop writing books if your gonna write this garbage.how did this book win an award, it must of won the award for the book that puts you to sleep the fastest, honestly i think that this was just a stupid corny book that shouldn't have won a award. if i was sharon creech I would slap my self for making such a piece of crap. READERS if you want an exciting book that will keep you on the edge of your seat then I promise you, DO NOT read this book. NOW if you want to go to sleep fast then READ this book.From Josh Mahoney. Canton"
3,K.A's book review,I like the way the author had delevolped the characters in the story. She put the characters in a lot of situations that they needed to handle. There arealot of adventurous things that happen in the story and I like stories that are like this. Sophie is my favorite character because she is always in charge of a situation. The story started out slow but it got better. They stopped in many places because Uncle Dock was looking for Rosalie and it was the stops along the way that made the story intresting.K.A.
3,Brooke j.,Looking for a good book to read!Then check out The Wanderer If you like adventure and some comedy this book is perfect.It's about a girl named Sophie who was adopted into a family. She goes on a boating trip to England with her three uncles and two cousins.On their trip they learn how to survive on the ocean and what a family really is.This book is told in two different point of views Sophies and her cousin cody's
2,The Ocean,"This was a great book but the closer you get to the 5th chapter it starts to get very confusing. I really couldn't follow along because it kept going back and fourth back and fourth like a tide and it made me very dizzy. One minute Sophie, the ocean girl,was tallking about her life then she was talking about her cousin, the one she might love. Not that I dislike these ""things"", boats, the ocean, and love but with so many things going on, I was confused. That is why I stopped reading this book."
2,the wanderer,"In the book l liked it and then I hated it. I hated this book because all they did was talk. Then I liked it because it was exciting and cool in some parts. Then it got boring. My favorite character is Cody. I like how they were on a boat. That was one of the only resons I liked it. The reason I hated it is because it had no excitement. That is why I hated it partly. I also hated it because a lot of guys never talk. The reason I like the book is because they are out in the sea. I also like this book because they get to go to England in the town. I think you should read this book because people have different opinions. Read this book, The Wanderer."
3,"Same Idea, Different Setting","This book is a variation on the theme introduced in Creech's book Walk Two Moons: a girl, through telling someone else's stories, comes to be able to acknowledge and accept her own. Both girls suffered an extreme loss, which they couldn't come to terms with. Both girls take a journey with others and thereby come to be able to accept their own tragedies and get on with life.This book is enough different that it does hold the reader's interest, but I rather wish that it didn't have so many similar echoes to its predecessors."
2,Rehashing Walk Two Moons,"Walk Two Moons is a beloved book, but I am disappointed in The Wanderer. If I hadn't read Walk Two Moons, I probably would have enjoyed The Wanderer more than I did. Like Walk Two Moons, the storytelling is well done and the writing is solid. Sophie is an interesting character and the growth of her and her cousins is enjoyable. What I don't like about The Wanderer is that it is essentially the same story as Walk Two Moons -- a girl on the cusp of womanhood is taken into the protection of colorful relatives who allow her the space to discover the truth about her past and her parent(s). Like Walk Two Moons there is a grandparent who needs the love and support only our hero can supply. Like Walk Two Moons, there is the moment of harsh realization.If you can read only one of the two books, read Walk Two Moons."
4,Book Review of the Wanderer,"The book I am writing this book review on is The Wanderer by Sharon Creech. The book is a realistic fiction novel.The Wanderer is about a girl who goes on a journey with her 3 uncles and 2 cousins. They don't think she can make it but she proves them wrong. Everyone on the ship has to teach the others a different, special thing. The girl, whose name is Sophie, tells them all about their grandfather, Bompie. They don't know how she knows this, but she does. They are traveling to go see Bompie. Everyone learns how to work together and get along with others.I thought that this book as very interesting. It wasn't my favorite fiction novel, but it was good. It can appeal to all ages who can read chapter books. This is the end of my book review."
5,cute book,"this is a neat little book. my daughter likes the pictures and enjoys looking at them often. she asks for this book a lot. it's a good way to introduce the Lord to children, but it in no way replaces the Bible. but is neat to read a bedtime book to a child having to do with God instead of just any old thing."
5,READ CAREFULLY!,"ATTENTION .THIS IS AN ALBUM FOR THE COF- FANS NOT JUST FOR EVERYONE.DO NOT COMPARE IT WITH THEIR PREVIOUS WORKS,CAUSE IT'S NOT AFULL ALBUM.BUY THIS ONE ONLY IF YOU HAVE ALL THE OTHER COF-CDS.ONLY THEN WILL YOU UNDERSTAND ITS VALUE..."
4,Lots of fun for the little animal lover.,"Bought this for my 7 year old a year ago for Christmas, he's played it several times since and loves it. Very user friendly since he can play it by himself once we get it started. Good questions for his age group. He learns from it so nothing I mind him playing. Would buy again."
5,No tiene cancion mala.. Espectacular,"Cuando ordene el CD, sabia por la cancion que estan pasando en la radio ""Todo Cambio"" que por lo menos una cancion buena tenia, pero cuando lo escuche completo...me impresiono que es uno de los pocos CD's que no tiene cancion mala; todas las canciones son espectaculares, las letras y la variedad de ritmos, hacen que sea un MUST HAVE!! Sencillamente ESPECTACULAR!!"
5,Interesting how they sing in 3 languages,It took me a long time to get around to purchasing music from this group but it was worth the wait. I can not say enough as to how WONDERFUL this group is. I first thought (by looking at them) that they were hard core rockers and their music may be the same way. Heck no!! It's like R&B and soft rock with a little hip hop (which is not the best) and a lot of romance. I am in LOVE with the last song. They actually sing it in an indigenous Mexican language. All I can say is WAY TO GO GUYS!!!!! This is a great buy.
5,Great!,"Sometimes you think that you are going to get some wierd songs in between the hit tracks, but I really enjoyed this album. Mario really has a good ear for music.Aveces los artistas tienen canciones raras entre las canciones buenas, pero en este caso, realmente disfrute de todas. Mario tiene excelente oido para la musica"
1,powerless state?,"the author¡s argument move away vague, impressionistic and general arguments about the supposed powerless state which globalization is meant to have induced. However, the concept of state capacity in his book is so vague that will weaken his argument. On the other hand, the states that the author select to support his conclusion cannot represent all the states in world. With the development of globalization, the capacity of multinational corporations is obviously more and more stronger than small states in the world. In Asian financial crisis, some individuals can destroy a nation¡s economy and make is backward about 20 years. From this point, the state become more and more powerless instead of what Weiss think in this book."
2,a coloring book,"This series of books is highly overrated. These may be the premiere wildlife guides but they are intensely irritating. This wildflower guide has some colored plates but a large quantity of line drawings leaving one puzzled as to what the plant might actually look like, even approximately.An outline drawing may be useful to discriminate between very similar plants, but as a field guide one needs a quick way of seeing a plant and finding a reasonable visual match. After a coarse selection a fine selection would then be appropriate.Why books of this nature are not in full color is a mystery. Are we expected to color-in the illustrations ourselves? The publisher is lazy -- excellent color printing is available nowadays."
5,Hysterical laughter at a great price,This compilation of McCall's humorous articles has great laughs on every page. I recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor.
1,"Sorry Crosley, but this music box is garbage!","I see that this particular music box is currently not available and maybe that is because Crosley realized that they were trying to sell junk at an expensive price. I'll still post this review, just in case it reappears for sale. The ""faux"" wood of the box had blemishes that would not come off, and the ""canned"" pseudo music box sound was distorted and did not even come close to sounding authentic. I sent it back the same day and I will compliment them on their efficient and fast return/refund policy. In truth however, if this ""music box"" cost me only 10 dollars, then I could have expected no more than what I received, but that is not the case.Avoid at all costs should this product re-enter the marketplace!"
2,Looks better from a distance,UGLY. the detail is very ugly the coloring is of low quality. the figurines are not proportioned. the kids not on horses are as big as the horses. I did not like it. it was for a present but i could not give it because it was so ugly. The underside of the wooden box is cheap plastic and the music is fuzzy and unclear. It would be more entertaining to burn a 50 dollar bill than to give 50 dollars and own this box
3,"For a new DVD, I expected wide-screen not full-screen",I don't know why they even bother making full-screen DVDs for new releases. My son of course loves all Thomas related material.
2,Charlie is annoying,"My 2yo loves Thomas and friends but this is one of the most annoying videos we have. The stories all involve Thomas getting in trouble intead of being helpful or friendly and the new train Charlie is so annoying I stopped letting my son watch this one. He much prefers the older style stories and loves ""The great discovery"" movie."
3,Correction to earlier review,"I have not read this book, yet I felt that I should still make a correction here to a mistake in an earlier review posted here. The person stated that THE GRACIE ALLEN MURDER CASE had not been made into a movie. There indeed was a GRACIE ALLEN MURDER CASE movie. It was released in 1939 and here is the Internet Movie Database entry for it, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031389/ . One thing worth noting is that George Burns was not asked to appear in the movie (I assume that he wasn't in the book either). It is one of the few (two or three?) movies Gracie Allen appeared in sans George."
2,brittle material breaks easily,THe pastice is a brittle and borke easily leading to sync and charge problems.
3,Treo 755p Sync Cable,"Good price for the cable, however, there is a connection problem with the cable. Is does not seem to fit into the slots of the 755p snug. Sure you can plug it in but when you pick it up, the connection is lost. If you're wanting a sync cable at a cheap price this will do the job. Cable is about 6 feet long and includes a sync button."
1,Charging cable only,"This cable will only charge the Palm Treo 755, but it will not allow for any syncing of data. A little misleading to imply it would allow data syncing."
3,Can't get it to sync with my computer...,"Its great for charging my phone while at work on my computer, but I get error messages everytime I plug it in. It won't sync up for some reason or another. Ive tried it on 3 different computers. My computer says I need the instalation disc, but nothing came with the cable except the cable."
2,The Art of Fashion Draping,"Good information in general, but there a lot of instructions that are unclear and/or EXTREMELY poorly edited (spelling/grammar mistakes etc). The book itself is not good quality and pages are already starting to fall out of my barely-month-old copy."
2,Book was covered in grease/oil,"The product itself is just fine. The book came in on time, but as soon as I opened the box I realized the outside cover of the book was covered in some kind of grease or oil. It's disgusting and incredibly unprofessional. There's no way the grease/oil got there after the box was taped up, which means the shipper missed something."
4,"Rare, early Elton songs, make this collection a must!!","EJ & Taupin prove that their early '69-'74 partnership was capable of producing excellent songs. Some of you may have heard a few of the tracks which have appeared on his ""Classic Years"" re-issues as bonus tracks. But there are some new ones here too! Outstanding!"
5,"Prada, the way to a women's heart","Got the Tobacco sole one for my girlfriend for Valentines day and looks identical to the one advertised. Comes with a certificate of authenticity and smells like genuine leather. It's hard to see from the pictures but, it does contain 5 card slots, a billfold, and a coin pouch built into it."
4,Zydeco Fun,"If you are looking for a CD that offers entertaining, lively, toe-tapping fun music you will love Mel Melton & the Wicked Mojo's new CD. They offer wonderful instrumentation, a great variety of songs and a CD filled with Louisiana Dance Hall Music sure to entertain and delight."
5,Great One,"I am thrilled that these ""War between the States"" songs are on a CD. I bought Songs of the South over 30 yrs ago on a 33 1/3 record. I love this album. Glad that Songs of the North were added to this CD.Ole Ernie's recordings still sound good.Civil War fans will love this one.D.G."
5,good history music,ernie ford did a pretty good job sing these old songs and i only listen to the southern songs .if your a civil war historian you must buy this cd
5,Wonderful,"Always loved Ernie Ford. He does a great job on these songs about the Civil War. Listen to it often and use it at our ""UDC""meetings..."
5,"Montague! How, could you give such a fantastic album 3 stars?","It seems like Montague knows very, very, little, about Bear Family products and such powerful, brilliant music. These two albums, are one of Tennessee Ernie's best. I own all of Ernie's albums and have them all on my computer and listen to him frequently! He is, without a doubt., one of the world's most powerful singers of the 20th century. These are very meaningful. Love it! Stonewall Jackson's Way is very catchy!"
3,Montague,"I was excited about ordering this item, but after receiving it and trying it out, I found only two selections that suited me. Both ""Lorena"" and ""Rebel Soldier"" were presented in sweet strains with Ford's great vocal ability. I also would give ""Vacant Chair"" a passing report. However, I wish I could have heard a sample of each song before purchasing. I probably would have selected something else by Ford.The accompanying booklet gave some explanation for my let-down. It indicated that the selections were performed in a time and circumstance that allowed the CD the greatest marketability. Therefore, the musical arrangements may not incorporate the authentic sound that the songs probably deserve.It's good, but not as good as I expected. And it was pretty expensive."
3,"Ok, but a bit simplistic","The book is correct for very novice student, but no more. It spends a lot of time explaining very basic facts and ideas (eg. the author justifies at length why learning a programming language, but does not discuss any other language apart from VBA). There are many examples, but they are often mere variations of each others."
1,Might Be Useful As Door Stop,"The experience reading this book is painful. It is clearly written, but shallow. Save your money, look around there are other more books worthy of your money."
5,The Best JCS,I love this recording I bought it and I am not normally a fan of JCS but being a collector of CDs I bought it anyhow. It's my favorite now. Its has weight and soul.
5,This may well be the perfect JCS.,"I had the honor of doing Jesus Christ Superstar at a summer performing arts school a couple summers ago and thus was able to hear many, many different recordings of the show (as the directors searched for concepts and styles to model after). This recording is by far my favorite. Every last member of the cast is absolutely incredible (""Gethsemane"" is to DIE for) and the orchestrations are even better. This album is cutting edge. A couple years before RENT even, this recording had a contemporary hard rock edge, with the influences of new digital technology (drum machines, studio effects, etc). The only thing I don't like about this recording is that it's not COMPLETE. Still it deserves five stars, for giving Webber's finest musical the best treatment it has ever had."
2,"Wow, what a mess.","This is really very bad. Jesus Christ Superstar is one Andrew Lloyd Webber's best scores, and this recording really ruins it. The orchestrations remind me of some really bad '80s music. I do not recommend this to anyone, those new to JCS will not understand how amazing this score really is, and old fans will just be confused as to why something so great was ruined."
2,jarring,"If you want to hear how John Raitt might do Jesus, this is the album to get. I love John Raitt but I know he never would have been caught dead doing JCS. Pass this up."
1,Terrible...what were they thinking....?,"terrible...what the heck did they do to this soundtrack...the dance routine stuff is awful. I just don't understand how they could take such a great piece of music and ruin it...but well...they did. I don't want visions of the ""fly girls"" dancing when I listen to Simon's song.Awful and nothing is better than the original London version and the 1973 movie version......."
1,Don't waste your money!!!!!,"I am a huge fan of JCS, I have several other versions and the reason I got this was from all the glowing reviews that I read here. If you are considering getting this version, DON'T!!!!!! It has to be the worst recording of Jesus Christ Superstar ever. The only ones worth getting are either the original motion picture soundrack or the 20th cast recording. I could barely listen to this recording. The only reason I am giving it 1 star is because of the gentleman that does Judas, otherwise the singing is 3rd rate if that and the music itself is arranged so poorly it's not to be believed. Save your money and go with one of the other recordings!"
4,BASE STORY LINE EXCELLENT!,"The base story line of the injured Marine, Brock Armstrong still living while Staff Sergeant Rob Newton, his buddy did not make it after a mine explosion tugs on the emotions of the reader.Rob's last request was for his wife, Callie, ""Don't let her crawl back in her hole and hide. Don't let her be a hermit!"" preyed on Brock's mind.He feels guilty when his body responds to a strong attraction to her. He practically knew all about her from listening to Rob and may have been half in love with her before he even met her.The story develops wonderfully along with their increase interest in helping each other heal. But despite their feelings of guilt they eventually give to their [or should I say her] hormones. [Too much for me]Sex is used as a cure-all?Wonderful story - excellently written - just too much. --M"
1,BEWARE OF AMAZON,THE PRESSURE WASHER PURCHASED FROM AMAZON WAS TWO YEARS OLD.IT WORKED LONG ENOUGH TO WASH ONE CAR.I WILL NOT BUY FROM AMAZON AGAIN.
3,"Good, not great","As other reviewers have said, the box came damaged although the machine didn't seem to be affected. Assembly was not difficult but disassembly would be very hard because of hidden screws. The PW181000AV has good power and the turbo nozzle works very well. After about 1/2 hour of use, pressure falls off significantly and I have to stop using it for about a 1/2 hour, presumable so the motor can cool down. That's annoying."
4,Campbell-Hausfeld Electric Power Washer 1810,"This is a great power washer to have around the house. I've cleaned the porch, porch swing, tools, the cars and lawn furniture and love the results!"
1,avoid this POS,"I bought one of these on sale at WalMart. This POS worked at first then it started leaking from inside resulting in reduced pressure. It was near impossible to open to repair the leak. And even once we got it open, it was a leak that could not be fixed. It was past warranty, of course, and now I have to go find another pressure washer."
1,Campbell Hausfield PW1810 - Junk Unit,The unit was very good for general cleaning of our deck and camper without tearing a hole in everything until it quit working within the 1st year. Called Customer Service to get help. They sent a call tag for the defective unit. Repacked in original packing and sent back. Received refurbished unit back in October 2009 and did not have time to test it. Put in warm basement for winter. Used 4 times in spring/summer 2010 and it worked great. Last time I used it I could not get pressure. Had to slide the adjustable nozzle all the way forward and let water run like a stream then slide back and I would get pressure. However after letting go of the trigger I would have to start all over again. What a joy when you need to use this. I have emailed the company again to see what's up with this POS. I will never buy anything from Campbell Hausfield again if this is there quality
1,Washer Fails After One Hour of Use,"1800 PSI ELEC. PRESSURE WASHERThis top rated machine worked for one day (one hour). The next day the motor would not start. Customer service and technical support could suggest nothing other than taking the unit to an authorized service dealer. The nearest one is two hours away. If you buy this unit (or any power washer), you had better make sure there is a nearby authorized repair service. Or buy from a store instead of online."
1,Failed within 1/2 hour of out of the box,"The QC on this product must be terrible. I've experienced the same failure as the reviewer above. Power washing a bike the unit just quit and would not come back on. In spite of a positive review from a ""consumer review"" web site this unit cannot meet that positive review's standards if it fails outright within one hour of being removed from the box."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought Model PW1810 - what a dissapointment! After the first use it would not start. Tried different sequences of on/off, reset, trigger, etc. and it sometimes worked so I did not return under warranty. Now after not using for 6 months it will not start at all and I am beyond the 12-month warranty period; Campbell Hausefeld will not extend it. Tells me to drive one hour for repair on my own.Wish we had read the user reviews before I purchased. The on-line ""expert"" endorsements must have been paid for by the manufacturer because the machine is junk. Next time I will stick to Sears or other well-known retailer (Lowes, Wal-Mart)."
2,Disappointment,"I purchased this to replace my tired unit that was several years and hours old. This unit has been over engineered and made less powerful while adding alot of weight. The water connection is on the wrong side and is very vulnerable to breakage, the extra length of cheaper hose swells up and absorbs pressure. The turbo wand is less powerful. They have even reduced the size of the wand holder holes so you have breakdown the wand to store it. Overall quite a disappointment."
5,Love this Skillet!,"I have been so impressed with this 10"" skillet. You can't beat the quality especially for the price. This was one of my first Cuisinart pieces and as a ""cook-in-training"" I wanted something that would help boost my confidence. Cuisinart cookware does it! I've never burned anything in this skillet and everything I cook in it has turned out right. I highly recommend it and am even considering getting another one myself!"
5,Great Item!,"Product came fast, cleaned up pond, scuffed areas with holes, then I did a final cleaning with brake clean. I applied the patches and they stuck to the liner very well. The adhesive is extra sticky and I had extreme confidence in the product from the begining. I filled the pond to the top rechecked this am still filled to the top and no peeling of patches! You can see them but its better than replacing the liner. Once the aquatic plants fill in you will never notice."
2,I didn`t received the control remote,I didn`t received the tv remote controlI have tried in diferents ways to do something and nobody help me to received itI don't know how to operate that tv without the remote control
3,There are better!,"Well,disapointing! below average picture & endless adjusting does not make it much better.Look elsewhere for a 19"" lcd."
4,good TV for bedroom,"i bought this TV about one month ago. it is good to me. i believe that it is a good choice as bedroom tv. if you wanna play game or watch movie, it's not a good opotion."
4,Samsung HDTV,The picture is very good with side angle view excellent. It does take much longer than comfortable to switch betweeen inputs and aquire the new signal. It is a little annoying. Otherwise it is a very good set.
2,Not the same Samsung Quality,"Worst Samsung of the bunch. We are Samsung lovers: my mother has a 32"" samsung LCD, my son a 40"" LCD, and I have used a Samsung 19"" Monitor for three years. All have been and still are spectacular. So why not go with the 19"" LCD for my kitchen set? Good idea, bad product.This one doesn't have the same color even with lots of tweaking. The field of view is good for only 30 degrees then it washes out. Look elsewhere."
2,I'm not happy.....,"After reading all of the reviews, I figured that this Samsung LCD would be a great TV. Most Samsung LCD's I've seen have been great. This TV is a below average product from Samsung. Picture quality is average, off-axis viewing is poor (common LCD problem) and sound is average. I paid a little more money for the TV to get a solid Samsung TV, this wasn't worth $400. YMMV (your mileage may vary)"
2,Sub-par,"The contrast ratio on this set is simply too low, making it nearly impossible to see dark areas. Tweaking the settings helps a little, but not much. The biggest drawback on this item is the white halo that other reviewers have mentioned. In darker scenes or in low light, the halo is extremely distracting, and simply unacceptable for a television of this price. I plan on returning the item to see if I can get one without the white bleed around the edges, or I may simply request a refund and keep shopping."
4,Good HD LCD TV,Bought this for my son to use in his dorm room at college (with cable connection). Works very well. Great picture and color.
1,Don't buy this TV if you want a good looking TV,"I own a repair shop and I have been repairing TV for years. This TV is great only for it's compact format. On the other hand, the image is just awful. White will shear and bleed at a higher contrast ratio. The high and low lights are also wrong (blue high/low lights). The sound is not great but good for the size of the speakers. Obviously, when there is movement the focus goes way off (common in all LCD, Plasma and DLP) and the image looks even more awful. You can also see the smear(lag,trail) when there is fast movement ( caused by slow LCD response time in the miliseconds). In the end, I have seen 1986 RCA 14"" TV's who had a better image quality. Mitsubishi 37"" TV 1992 beats this TV by about 10 times and has a response time in the nanoseconds. End of line, this LCD TV has a very poor image quality. I give it 1 star since the menus and remote are very easy to use and the TV has a very compact design."
5,"Excellent reception using the 29"" Samsung","With using only a roof top antenna, I get excellent reception of HDTV. I am very pleased with the picture and quality of this 19"" Samsung TV."
1,Great features but poor picture quality,"Everything about this TV is great, except the most important thing - the picture. Everything on the screen had a glowing outline around it and the motion was jumpy. Thought it could be something about my cable, or damage during shipping, so I went to a local store that carries the same model. The one they had was just as bad...but the Toshiba sitting next to it had a great picture, so I bought it and returned the Samsung. And the Toshiba cost less, even after paying tax!"
5,Very clear picture,Very clear picture. Glad we bought it. Only problem was that we ordered a black one but received a white one. We would have preferred the black one because it went better with our other electronic pieces. .
3,Not bad for background HDTV,"Picked up one for the bedroom. Not a bad TV. The built-in HD tuner is nice for over the air HD service. The black finish looks sharp. It does suffer from the small ""white band"" at the top and bottom of the screen as other reviewers noted, no doubt due to the LCD backlight. Samsung could have done a better job trying to shield this. Also, the low contrast ratio makes the color sort of ""red"" and not as vibrant as what you might find on some models with a higher contrast ratio. All-in-all not a bad LCD for a small place in a bedroom or kitchen."
2,Picture quality problems.,"This TV has very low contrast ratio of 800:1. Most mordern TVs are 6000:1 and above. Low contrast manifests itself in low brightness with less detail and redish skin tones.I guess you get what you paid for... I have returned this set and bought Sharp LC20D42U 20"" for extra $200, but picture quality is superb."
2,Another Dud,"We bought this for the kitchen. After much research and waiting two weeks for it to ship from Amazon, we were very excited to open it up and get going. The first problem was apparent before we even plugged it in--no remote in the box. Then, we plugged it in and proceeded through the setup. There was a two inch green stripe running vertically down the middle of the tv. No amount of adjustment to the settings would make it go away. We had to send it back, but Amazon no longer had them. I will give it one more try from another supplier, but if it has the slightest problem, I'm buying something else."
1,2 Samsung TV's Die after only 3 yrs of use,"Samsung reliability is terrible and completely unacceptable. My following 2 Samsung LCD TV's LNT4066 & LNT1953H which I purchased in fall of 2007 both died within a month of each other. They were built in 4/2007 and fell victim to Samsung using cheap power supply capacitors.....No product which cost as much money as a TV cost should fail after only 3 years of the same issue. Samsung TV's have great pictures and the past performance reviews have been very good, however I cannot and will not ever buy another samsung product again!!!!!I have a Samsung PN50A650 Plasma also. Everytime I turn it off now I wonder now if it will ever work again. Way to go Samsung!!! Good business practice scimp on Quality and lose another loyal customer!"
3,Not bad for it's price,"I bought this tv mainly for playing my xbox 360 video games in HD. And it was worth every cent. While it's not top of the line by any means it's price can't be beat for the quality of the product. As for watching regular tv on it it's not so great, the images are usually too dark and you have to do a lot of adjusting but I don't subscribe to hd tv so I can't say that the images wouldn't be improved if I did subscribe to it. As for gaming on it I love it. While once again it is a little dark, I've had no trouble with ghosting and the audio is great. So my recomendation is that if you're a gamer who has a very small space to game in and want to see your games in HD then this tv is a great buy."
2,Not quite...,"I bought this version for the HDMI port because my previous 19 inch Samsung didn't. When I started setting it up, I noticed a white blurry light bleeding from the edges. I didn't know what it was but I thought as I continued the setup, I could make adjustments to get rid of it. But I didn't find anything. The picture quality for this wasn't what I expected either, my old Samsung had very crisp images, this had a very noticable graininess to it. It was like that with my Xbox360 for both games and DVD. The PC connection wasn't any better. No matter how I messed with the settings for both TV and computer, I couldn't get a fine, clear image. I think I'll look for a bigger version. Pity, I had such high hopes for this one."
4,Great little TV,"I purchased this TV after buying the 26 inch version. Both TV's have been great although with the smaller version it is not possible to turn off the little chirping sound when the TV goes on and off and the smaller one doesn't have PIP. This TV is extremely easy to set up and use. I only use the basic functions but they both have a lot to choose from. As some of the reviews have stated, the smaller TV does or can have a little strip of light at the top of the screen; I fixed this problem by changing the view size. Overall I have been very happy with these models of Samsung HDTV's."
4,Good product... good Amazon service,"The product is ok... I knew that there was a leackage of white light in the upper border and in the bottom. But it is a little bit more anoying that I spected, also there is a little bit of that at the left and right side of the screen. The colors and the image quality are great. The sound is also great... Recomended for the price"
1,Power connection problem,"I purchased this TV in March of 2008. Just in the last month or so, I started having problems with the power connection. From what I can tell, it isn't the cord, but the connection on the TV. I was able to jiggle it around and get it to connect, but any bump to the TV and the connection is gone. I have a new 40"" Samsung that is working great, but I'm very disappointed with my 19""."
3,INTERPOL DRAMA HINTS OF JAMES BOND?,"From 1957. When his sister is murdered, an Interpol agent (Victor Mature) swears vengeance on the drug kingpin (Trevor Howard) responsible for her death. By chance, he is assigned to do just that! The pursuit leads to London, Rome, Athens, Paris, and New York where Kingpin Howard finally meets his unexpected but just demise. Nice international flavor of what is a changed but familiar landscape. This is a film very much of its era. A kind of precursor to the yet unborn James Bond franchise with Mature assuming a license to kill on a globe-trotting mission against an evil organization that threatens the values of the west."
4,Doug Mcclure + The Lost World = High Adventure!,"I loved this movie as a kid and I still love it now. Despite not having Harryhausen quality dinosaur effects, for the time, the effects are generally pretty good. Definitely better than the effects featured in many other movies of that type of the time and way above those in ""At The Earth's Core"". The acting is pretty good all around, especially the German captain and his sneering first mate, Dietz. And of course, no film of this type would be complete without the incomparable Doug McClure!This movie really imparts an excellent sense of adventure as both a war drama and a fight for survival in the lost world of Caprona. They aren't stingy with the dinosaurs either as the sequel, 'The People That Time Forgot' is. All in all, this is a fun movie that really captures the essence of what dinosaur films of the current period like the Jurassic Park sequels are missing - a sense of adventure and a soul."
4,Flash back to those heady days...,"Fun movie. It is a flashback for me and I wanted my son to see them. They all acted so seriously while guys with big foam dinosaur heads were bashing them - as seen on the box cover. Doug McClure made a few of these movies and they were fun. And for no discernible reason I could see other than some cool special effects, they shot (er, blow up) some dinosaurs using the submarines cannon.The three species of humans was fun too, this idea of rapid evolution. Sounds painful though.Anyway, great fun and even younger kids can watch it as it is not like many gore filled movies seen today."
2,This movie's effects are outdated by Jurassic Park,"It can be said that the day, Jurassic Park was made, every other film that had ever been made about dinosaurs became outdated in the special effects department. This is true here. The dinosaurs look so fake, you can tell they are models and people in phoney rubber suits rather easily. The acting is very poor and the characters are very one-dimensional. This film is better left forgotten."
5,A real classic,"Whenever I read reviews in movie guides I am saddened to see this film is given a hard time. Alright, so the dinosaurs aren't Harryhausen/Jurassic Park fare, but they're certainly a lot better than most other low-budget dinosaur/monster movies of their time (or since then, for that matter). A group of shipwrecked WW1 navymen board and take over the German U-boat which sunk their vessel. Before long, however, they are hopelessly lost, are forced to co-operate as they come across a lost island.What really makes this film stand out is its superb atmosphere, its sense of drama, its believable characters, its well-staged battle sequences (both human and prehistoric), and its storyline involving an island as a living thing. A real classic, and one in the eye for those who scoff at the British film industry."
4,Exciting Family Adventure,If your kids love Jurrasic Park types of movies they will love this rousing fun adventure from the 70's where a group of explorers find themselves on a remote island full of creatures including dinosaurs. This tape is also inexpensive. Great saturday afternoon fun! Highly Recommend!
1,None of the 3 DVDs will work on Apple DVD players!,"WOW!What a disappointment! The DVD I ordered (M1A/M14 Rifle Cleaning & Maintenence for Improved accuracy will not play in any of the three Apple computers I have.My G5 Power Mac, as well as my Mini Mac (both with IBM style processors) as well as my MacBook Pro, will not play these DVDs. All three computers have Apple's DVDplayer, and I tested all three with other musical & movie DVDs which worked just fine. I phoned the producer of this DVD, and since then they have sent two more ofthe M1A DVDs, the last of which they claimed to have tested on an Apple computer.At this point, I am ready to take these DVDs to the Grand Rapids Apple Store so they can certify these DVDs DO NOT WORK in Apple DVD players.I guess I'm just out twenty some dollars at this point."
3,old school,This is old school music and not for the novice listener. A great overview of the blues music roots. I would not buy again.
5,ahhhhh memories,This game is a lot of fun. Combines puzzles and strategy memories come back its amazing and it even works on xp and win 7
5,"Great Shoes! Not so great service from ""Shoes on the Web""","I love the shoes! This is my second pair of New Balance MR 859. I have flat feet and I over pronate so finding a shoe that solves both issues is not an easy job, but this shoes does it! The service I reiceved from ""Shoes on the Web"" was disappointing. My shoes took 28 days to be delivered. They said it was because my shoes were returned to them from Canadian customs but they didnt advise me of this until I emailed them to see what the delay was. They offered no compensation in any way for the inconvenience and literally just said ""we can't control the post office"". I would buy these shoes again in an instant but I wouldnt buy from ""Shoes on the Web""."
2,Cuter in the picture,"I saw a friend wearing similar and thought they were cute, but they didn't have the same impact on my larger size foot. Because of that, but not because of style or comfort, I sent them back. Did not keep long enough to comment on other."
3,Cannot review,"Sorry that I cannot review this. It was bought for a person in Mexico who asked me to get it for him. But,he was gone when I returned, and someone else brought it to him.I have heard nothing."
1,inconsistent sizing,Either the design sizing or the quality control of these shoes is inconsistent - the size I ordered based on the prior year shoe does not suit me in this years model. Sizing does not appear to be dependable.The shoes cannot be returned once tried without re-stocking fee and shipping costs. Perhaps I should go back to buying running shoes in a shop where a proper fit can be confirmed.
4,Altogether a pretty good pair of running shoes,"New Balance reliably makes shoes that fit my slightly wide feet. It is one of the few brands that offers wide half-sizes, and that's why I buy them."
5,Wonderful little find,"I found ""Paranormal Ireland"" at Barnes & Noble for a very reasonable price. I decided to give it a try since I've always been intrigued by the supernatural, and have familial ties to Ireland. It sat on my coffee table for about a year before I read it. It's a terrific book--full of facts and theories on interesting phenomena, presented with a distinctly Irish character. The author doesn't try to debunk the stories, nor does he try to convince the reader. He leaves it up to the readers to decide. ""Paranormal Ireland"" is a wonderful book!"
1,Everything but what you want,"If you were hoping to see the Price is Right so-called Barker's Beauties, then this is not the DVD for you. Whether due to contracts or personal peeves, the beauties appear only briefly on the disk which, devoid of them, is quite monotonous."
4,About time!!!,"A huge shout-out to the folks at Fremantle Media and BCI for FINALLY bringing one of my all-time favorite Goodson-Todman game shows to DVD!The episodes contained in this collection are priceless indeed - starting with the four black-and-white shows with the beloved Bill Cullen, right through the early episodes (great trip down memory lane when contestants were attired nicely).For me there were a couple of drawbacks - great to see Bob Barker's final week included, but disappointed that no episodes from the 1980s and 1990s are represented. Also, it would have been extra nice to include special tributes to two men who preceded Rich Fields in the announcer's podium - the sorely missed Johnny Olson and Rod Roddy.Overall, the packaging is superb. Let's see more in the future!!!"
2,Not The Best,"As a long time Price Is Right fan I was eager to see The Best of The Price is Right. Unfortunately it is not on this dvd set. I did find the Bill Cullen shows interesting, and those old dark haired Bob shows were entertaining, but a little goes a long way when you are eagerly waiting for the best to begin. I expected to see the Price Is Right that I loved with the beautiful girls Janice, Dian, Holly, and the adorable Johnny. Those shows aren't anywhere on this dvd set. I was expecting The Best of The Price Is Right but sadly it's not here."
1,"Not the ""BEST"" of TPIR","As a life-long fan of the show, I am very dissapointed. Fremantle would be better to put together a disc set of bloopers, set mis-haps, behind the scenes (showing the entires soundstage) and cast/crew interviews.I have a problem with this being promoted as the ""Best of The Price Is Right"". This is in fact a compilation of what seems as the first season of The Price Is Right, their move to 1 hour episodes and the last week of Bob Barker.I have seen better episodes on the Internet. I wish I could get my money back, but I would not be able to."
4,"Price is right with ""Price Is Right""","Many have harped about the DVD set ""The Best Of The Price Is Right"" for its selection of its earliest four years of the CBS show and Bob Barker's final week as it excludes some noted show models. Others, who were born way after the CBS show began, think the Bill Cullen shows shouldn't have been included (""It's not in color!..."" ""it doesn't have pricing games!..."" ""the contestants aren't crazy!..."" ""we can't psychoanalyze the lettering font in a game display!""). Cry me a river, all of you. Cullen's show was TV's top game in its day and Barker's version probably wouldn't have made it on the air without it paving the way. As for the selection of Barker episodes, let it stand as a testament, a litmus test, of how it started as a ""Let's Make A Deal"" ripoff and became TV's longest running game. If anyone's to blame for not having a wider spread of shows, blame either CBS or Barker himself and his beef with the excluded models."
2,"Barker's DVD, with Cullen Only Along for the Ride","The DVD set is chock full of early Barker material, as many have mentioned here, which is usually the point of these DVDs. So, if your a fan of that, this should be a good purchase. However, being more a fan of early TV, the first of four discs offers just four shows of the Bill Cullen years, which is sadly not enough. The most interesting part of looking back @ such a show as this is for the history of our economy, specifically our cost of living: boats, cars, Hi Fis, Americana, etc. I've seen the early years on the Game Show Network and it's by far the most fascinating. I mean, this is how we lived in the 50s & 60s!!! However, this is just not the DVD set for that! So, beware!!!"
1,Waste of money!,"Total waste of money! Definitely not the best of the Price Is Right. The best was the mid 70s to mid 90s. None of that here. Just really old shows before my time, and Bob Barker's last week...seen it, not worth seeing again. Kept waiting for it to get good. Yawn. Misleading title. Waste of time and money."
1,A WASTE OF MONEY,"""The Best of the Price is Right""??? HARDLY! I bought this collection for my kids who grew up watching The Price Is Right but not one of the shows from their childhood are on it. It's only old shows from the early seventies and before. I'm returning it tomorrow. I think if you are a game show enthusiast and you think that really old episodes and the black and white years of Pirce is Right are ""the best"" then this would be interesting to you. Otherwise it's like watching a really long PBS documentary on the early days of tv gameshows...BORING!."
1,BORING DISAPPOINTMENT,I bought this for my brother who was a huge fan and I thought he would enjoy it. He didn't. He said it's just old shows he never saw and none of the good years he remembered were in it. What a disappointment.
3,Who thought it would be a good idea to put a game show on DVD?,"A real nail biter for sure. I watch it over and over. I know who Johnny is going to call on to be the next contestant, I know what prize they will bid on, I know the actual price of the prize before they bid (you will too after watching this just once), i know which grocery item is between $1.75 and $2.15, I know what prize they are playing for and if they win it before they even play the game, and i know who is going to be in the final showdown round, and whether they go over, before they even place their bid. I just can't stop watching this. Here's the fun part, invite your friends over for a Saturday night, play the DVD, and shout out the answers before the contestants actually say them. This dvd will most certainly answer the meaning of life for you."
2,Duplicate as last DVD collection. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I love The Price is Right, but was disappointed when I received my, what I thought was a collection of different shows, DVD's in the mail. They are the same shows as in the first DVD collection. Someone at Amazon should make a note for future buyers that this is the same collection as the previous one.So, if you already have the first collection then DON'T buy this one!!!!"
5,The best of the best !,"I LOVE the Price is Right ! Even traveled to the show and was in the audience ! Great fun ! The best part of the Dvd were the episodes from the 70's. How wild ! The fashions,hairdos,housewives,cool cars and the retro prices of merchandise ! And lots of Bob Barker,the finest game show host in history,in my opinion ! I enjoyed this dvd so much and hope they release more episodes in this time period. I would love to own them all !"
2,Dupicalte DVD - Purchased by mistake,I bought the new DVD it is the same as the last one. It was just redone in a new package. Unhappy with the purchase.Best of the Price Is Right: 26 Episodes
3,Reprint,"If you're expecting new material for this edition, you will be disappointed. This is merely a reprint of the 1st ""Best of TPIR"" set BCI Eclipse released a few years ago."
4,be careful--VERY best is same,VERY best of price and the BEST of price is right are the same identical shows---stick with this one-the best--packaged better---others paper sleeves-same shows different header--its a shame they get away with just changing the name
1,Wrong bit in package.,"I received this bit, the package was labeled with the correct part number, but the bit had only 2 cutters, not the 4 that were described in the description. Close examination of the picture shows a bit with only 2 cutters.I don't know how well it works, since I sent it back."
2,I gave it away..,I just didnt find it all that appealing when i got it. My mistake for ordering it. You would be better off buying a small cooler and the board game.
5,101 Uses,"I love this item. I've used it as a hamper, a cooler, a purse hider, and so much more. My dad used it to hold his sleep apnea machine when he went camping with me. It was the perfect height (he slept on a double raised air mattress). The only con I found with this item was I couldn't fit it back in the box. I'm a box saver. I find puting my camp stuff backin the box makes packing my trunk easier."
4,Great for camping,"Bought 2 of these for camping trip to elevate my feet. And to my surprise they are comfortable and have many uses. You can put snacks in them, use it for trash, seat for kids 3-8yrs, foot elevation and Im using them as makeshift barstools under a small table in my tent. I like them Oh and you can put ice and drinks in them also. There is even a video on You tube showing how great they are check it out!"
4,SACD My First Purchase,"The sound is great but keep in mind that SACD only output from ANALOG ports on your CD/DVD player. I found out that this is because Sony, who owns the format, is paranoid about people copying a perfect digital replica so they output in a less perfect format. Beyond that, as I stated, the audio is great !"
1,Don't Waste Your Money and Time with This Title!,"This title creates needless confusion for any MTEL candidate. It seems to this poor soul who made the mistake of purchasing and trusting this book, that the publisher has issued a generic literacy skills test book and therefore a volume of NO VALUE IN THE MTEL test. Example: MTEL readings are not the writings, as shown in the book, of Thomas Hardy or Sigmund Freud (excuse me, Freud in translation on an ""English test?""); MTEL includes writings of modern authors and current textbooks. Please, do not in any circumstances buy this title. If you happen to purchase this, you will undoubtedly want to return it to the publisher with a letter of indignation. Kindly include in your letterenclosure of the one star I had to give this book in order to review it!"
3,too much info,"This product covers too much info--grammar, vocab, etc., and is not an excellent product. It does have some helpful sections, however."
4,Great Book,"I like the book very much even though I haven't start reviewing yet, but I already flip pages.. look like it better MTEL reviewer book than the one I buy from Kaplan. this is really the one that I had to study for my morning test. I will order another book for my afternoon test later on."
5,Great practice for the real exam,"Basically, this book is just like the real exam. If you do this book in its entirety and follow the study guide, you should be well prepared for this exam. Make sure to study those vocabulary words!"
5,Mtel Comm. & Literacy,This book is the only book I used for test prep. for the Reading and Writing parts of the MTEL. It covered everything that was on the test. I highly recommend this book as a study guide.
2,Poor condition.,"The advertisement stated that it was in ""average used condition"". This book is full of practice tests and quizzes, and every single one was filled in. Spend the money and buy a new one, as I did after tossing this one."
5,must have,"This is a must have book to prepare any educator in Massachusetts, it helped me pass! It was not too hard either!"
5,If you are taking the MTEL you need this book,"I am trying to make a mid-career change and enter teaching. In order to become a teacher in Massachusetts, you must pass the MTEL Communications and Literacy Skills test. This test requires very recent knowledge of comprehensive English grammar/reading/comprehension skills. The last formal English grammar class I had was more than 25 years ago and I did not know how I was going to prepare for this test. Then I found this book! It was a very accurate representation of the test material. I would not take the test without using this to review-whether you graduated from college 1 year ago or 25 years ago."
1,Outdated,"Despite the 2005 copyright, this book has outdated test information, particularly for the writing subtest. It refers to a no-longer included dictation section and has other inconsistencies with the current test. If you use this book, make very sure to read the test bulletin provided online very carefully to make sure you are studying for the test you will actually take. I found this book to be no help at all studying for the test."
5,Old fashioned blues-soul-gospel singer,"The best of Mighty Sam McClain is the best of a superb traditional musician. His rendition of the gospel number ""Lord Will Make a Way"" is equal to any recording. [For those unfamiliar with gospel blues this has been recorded by Marion Williams, Sister Ernestine Washington, Blind Boys of Alabama, the Abyssinian Baptist Choir ... i.e. there are many great recordings.] Whether speaking of love, heartbreak or religion the emotion of the vocals comes through as if the emotion comes from the very core of Sam McClain. The backup band remains true to McClain's traditional blues-soul-gospel sound - the sound is not ""retro"" in the sense of trying to sound like its precursors but is a natural accompaniment.If you like blues you will love this album."
2,"Stick to Novels, Mr. Levithan","I was really excited to read The Realm of Possibility. I'm a fan of Levithan's many other works, and thought this would be on par with his other writing. Character development is a personal favorite feature of novels, and with 20 different characters featured, I thought we'd get to see plenty of that. Unfortunately, 20 characters ended up leading to 20 disjointed, messy, incoherent stories, to the point where I was confused about the very purpose of the book. It read more like an outline for a book than a finished copy. It was a good start, and could have been executed better, perhaps in using short stories rather than poems, but there wasn't much cohesion between the 20 stories being told. The writing itself was classic Levithan, full of Big Life Truths, and it did not disappoint. I can't say the same for the book as a unit, though."
1,Not worth buying,I do not like the theme or the way it is written. Couldn't finish it because it was that bad.
1,"A good performance, bad recording","This is a good performance, but on my CD the climaxes are terriblyoverloaded, verified by ripping the CD to computer and looking at thewaveforms. This is quite audible. I have no idea if this appliesto the same performance in the multi-CD Bis compilation albums."
