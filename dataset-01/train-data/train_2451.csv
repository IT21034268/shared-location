2,Disappointing,"I had high expectations for this book given the ratings - and found it was predictable, nothing special and adolescent. If the main character fell or stumbled or needed to be picked up by her love interest one more time - come on - even pregnant women in their 8th month can walk without stumbling.Overall, it felt like a teen romance with older characters. Very disappointing."
2,Not as good as other Karen White books,"There are many good books by Karen White; this is not as good. I do like Folly Beach, the Beach Trees, and the first two books in the Tradd Street Series. I like books with multiple points of view, and several plot lines that intersect. I also like books about ghosts and mysterious happenings. However, this book was a little slow for the story, and predictable. It might be one of White's earlier books before she learned more about writing, because that's what it reminds me of. A little too sugary sweet in places, and the hero/heroine don't have enough flaws to be believable. In fact, there was a lot of this book that made it unbelievable--and I can't exactly describe why."
5,Their best,"This is the best of the Uncle Tupelo albums. Not a bad track on here, but the highlights are Gun, Still Be Around, Watch Me Fall, True to Life, Postcard and If That's Alright. Definitely worth a purchase."
5,Buy this,"I've been on a UT kick for eight years or so, and this is still the best of the four. All four are great, I'm just mad that I missed them live. I could listen to ""Gun"" forever.This band is up there with The Replacements, and this album matches ""Let It Be"" for energy. Enough said there. Enjoy."
4,What about the extra tracks?,"Often it seems like the first cd you ever get by a band, the one that makes you a fan, that'll often be your favorite, for nostalgic reasons if nothing else. That's the case with STILL FEEL GONE for me. Even though ANODYNE is more mature and impressive, and NO DEPRESSION is more intense, somehow this is still my favorite.It's a bit of a sluggish mess, though, sonically! I wonder if anyone who has this remastered version can talk about a) any changes in the sound and b) the quality of the bonus tracks.[If you're curious about Uncle Tupelo and don't have any of their albums, get their ""greatest hits"" collection for starters. They only have 4 real albums, though. Note that ""March 16-20"" is a VERY acoustic album, the others all mix acoustic and electric instruments.]"
5,Buy This CD!,"What a shame that this group never got their due while they were together. The first song ""Gun"" is the closest to pop that they ever got. It should have been a hit single. I used to hate country music but after hearing UT I realize what I really hated was and is the glossy gutless country music of today. This cd has some country elements on it without the gloss and it rocks like hell also. I would give it 10 stars if I could. Pull out the credit card and buy it!"
5,"still feel gone, indeed...","a month or so ago, a buddy burned me a copy of some UT bootleg from the mid 90s (it's unofficially called 'Last Call') and though i had most of the songs, it came across as a revelation. the only missing cd i had was 'still feel gone' (i got into the band just as they were breaking up), and now i have it. the buddy who burned me the live cd said 'y'know, that band never should have broken up. those two guys brought out the best in each other, and while there are some good wilco and son volt songs, those first three albums were the high water mark.' alas, after listening to this, and going into the back catalogue to hear anodyne and march 17-21, 1992, i sadly must agree. these guys were BEYOND great; the best thing that american music produced since Gram's Flying Burrito Brothers... what fine, fine music..."
1,It melted!!!,I don't know how a company could possibly mess up making a mousepad...but they did it. The LEDs beneath the pad melted the surface the mouse goes on (which is just a thin stuck-on piece of plastic). Now there is major deformation on the surface and the pad is useless. The worst mouse pad I have ever had happened to also be the most expensive.
5,A concise and elegant review of economic development issues,"A concise and but detailed review of the most important issues in agricultural development. The text includes new and important perspectives on issues in development. Topics covered include dualistic development, domestic financing of development, external financing of development, human resourses, industrialisation and agriculture and trade/development. This is an excellent reference book as well as a very interesting read. It is uptodate and enables the reader to quickly grasp the main themes. Also includes comprehensive references for futher reading. Very good value!"
2,Unsatisfied,"The product was a very old edition (1980) so it was lacking much of the more contemporary material, including issues on gender."
5,Detailed and thought provoking,"I am impressed with the level of detail that the author went to, in order to paint a complete picture of Du Bois. Du Bois himself lived in a remarkable time in American history (being born a few years after slavery ended and dying months before Dr. Martin Luther King's march on Washington) Lewis captures the evolution of the time and the character of the day with his detailed portrayl of Du Bois' life, and the major events that captured the nations attention during that time."
1,Incompete & not as advertised,"For a book that claims to be a ""complete"" book on wild boar hunting, a lot has been left to be desired. The author leaves nearly everything unsaid. For example, he goes into detail about the importance of finding sign, but there is not one picture of a wallow, a hog track, scat, etc. There is zero information on field dressing hogs, where the vital areas are for shot placement, etc. This book is generalized, explaining the importance of most things but falls short of explaining HOW to do them. I was very disappointed with book, which is really nothing more than a photo album of the author with a bunch of dead pigs."
4,A Good Read,"Pictures in this book are not good, as otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. Author discusses use of a range of weapons which is interesting as my only experience is with rifles. Good review of equipment and clothing. Recommendations for Florida probably most appropriate for us in Australia. Overall a very good read."
4,Good book for newbies,The book is great for beginners like me (I had killed hogs before and after reading). The portion on stand hunting helped me select my next stand after reading the book and guess what; I killed a decent boar from the ground at 50 yards using what I had learned in the book. Definitely worth the price.
4,first time hogs,This year was my first time hunting hogs.I found this book very helpful.Yes hogs are very smart it has been hard hunting them here in FL.
3,Decent book for beginners.,"I am new to hunting and I did get a lot of useful info out of this book. The pictures are some of the worst quality I have seen in a book. Overall though, the price was good and I like hard cover. I would recommend it."
1,?,"LET ME WARN YOU, HOT PRODUCTIONS IS SELLING ANOTHER CDRYES I SAID THE MANUFACTURER IS SELLING CD-R's INSTEAD OF ORIGINALSTHIS IS A FAKE CD"
5,12 Men of Christmas,"I watch this every year on TV, I decided to buy the movie. My husband and I find the interaction between the characters EJ and Will hilarious. We find Ms. Chenoweth adorable in this movie."
4,12 Men of Christmas,One of my favorite to watch during the holidays. I saw it last year and decided I wanted to add it to my personal collection.
3,Very entertaining,This movie rates 5 stars for entertaining but it comes in lower because of the premarital sex and sexual innuendos through the movie. The couple is charismatic (except when she wears that silly looking helmet) and it's easy to get caught up in the romance.
3,Made for TV,If you are Kristin Chenoweth fan you might enjoy this but this is a rehashed story with an obvious plot line. The characters are predictable and the acting is minimal. The Montana scenery takes center stage.
5,OleMan,I liked the movie very much . It like a romance movie that is very enjoyable . I cliked thew way that the movie unfolded to help out the rescue team to get what they needed .
5,12 men of christmas,"Fantastic movie,arrived quickly and in great condition.Good for the whole family, but I'm sure we ladies appreciate it the most!12 Men of Christmas"
4,cute movie,12 Men of Christmas is a cute romantic comedy. The cast was great and the scenry in the movie was beautiful. On a different note: I bought the movie and got within a couple days. Seller was fast and the item was in great shape.
4,Christmas and Beautiful scenery.,"Cute movie. Kristin is really sweet and funny in this movie and plays well off the men in it. The gorgeous scenery is a wonderful bonus, not to mention the calendar guys! I've been watching it after Christmas too."
5,"Just a FUN, happy midless movie that doesn't disappoint!",I have this movie and I love it! Super predictable... but so much fun! I've watched it a ton when I want something just plain fun and mindless. If you are wanting something of that nature... this won't dissappoint. Enjoy!!
4,12 Men of Christmas resurrects Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy,"As an avid Jane Austen fan, I am constantly alert to movies that resurrect the plot of Pride and Prejudice-my favorite Austen novel. I was pleasantly surprised to revisit Darcy and Elizabeth in this lighter Christmas movie. While it won't take any literary prizes, it is a cute retelling of my favorite classic of all time. The similarities are evident in the relationships of several of the characters--clearly the best friend has the same Bingley adoration and respect for his friend and won't pursue a love relationship with the heroine's friend as a result of well-meant but wrong advice from him. The delicious verbal sparring is also Darcy-esque. And of course there is the bad boy who seems sterling but lacks morals, preying upon women--especially rich ones. This was fun!"
5,Profound for dance music,This album is kickin. I dig the songs and the vocals are smooth. The production is tight and the songs have meaning. Rare for dance music to actually say something profound. I recommend this to all ages.
4,"Nice, but rolls","I bought two of these bras - two different sizes since I measured between the two. Both fit fine in cup, and one fits tight around the ribcage, the other fits slightly loose. The downside to this bra, regardless of the size I prefer, is that the bottom band rolls continually. Every private moment I can find throughout the day, I am unrolling the band around my ribs. I like the 'posture' benefits -- very good support, but I don't care that the high criss-cross back shows through my tops (pure vanity - I feel like an old lady with that look). The straps stay in place -- no slippage, but I find the straps show more than I prefer when I'm wearing any scooped neck top. I am searching for another style, but if I can't find anything I like better, I would return to this bra -- it was truly that good for posture-support.Glamorise Women's MagicLift Front Close Posture Support Bra #1265"
2,Not Much Support!,"This bra was a little pricey, but I ordered 2 of them anyway because of the front close feature. My sports bras give me more support than this bra does. Too.... stretchy for any real support. If you are a C cup or more look elsewhere for a front closure support bra."
4,Very nice bra,Soft and comfortable bra that fits and supports in all the right places. I'm happy I was able to find such a nice bra at such a nice price.
3,it okay,the band rolls under and the cups are too large. the only i was disappoie part of the product that fit were the straps. I was disappointed over all.
4,Great bra...Back Support???,"I love the comfort of this bra. I'worn it twice and washed twice. It washes well.The only problem... It was advertised as a back support bra. The back support is minimal. It needs a little more structure in the criss-cross and in the straps to make it back support. Also, if the straps had a lttle wider strap at top.I will keep it because it is so wearable."
1,ugly,why do larger bras have to get soo ugly?! big boobs should be in pretty lovely bras not these awful hooks and ladders s****.
1,Bad Bra,Oh lord....if you have sisters that need taming don't buy this bra. It may be fine for smaller gals but...40DDs need not apply. Not even close.
5,Great price on quality bra,I have worn this style of bra for years and was happy to find it at such a competitive price. Great support for large breasted women. Runs a little bigger than expected.
1,Pointy Breasts,I really would like to see a full-figured bra that does not give you torpedo breasts. This made my breasts look like Madonna's in her pointy bra. Terrible!
5,My wife loves these!,"When your married you learn from your wife bras are not all the same. My wife is a G size. While that's great for me, she has back probloms due this size. These bras give her great relief. I love these bras because I love my wife."
4,comfortable,"Wife writing review.... bought this bra and always has trouble finding one that fits right. Ordered 3 different sizes and sent 2 back. After never having a bra that fit right finally went with the European way of measuring and what a difference. Straps don't cut in her shoulders, band fits right! Bra takes a bit to adjust to front closure but once you figure it out it's fine. Band rolls up a bit, but that could be because of me being overweight, not the bra. The top middle does poke out a bit up on top, but I don't really care as the rest fits fine. Yes I would buy again."
2,It's Ok...,"The fit of this Bra is bulky, it does not fit true to size but seemingly bigger. I order a different style in the same size and the other bra fit perfectly. I will not order this design again."
3,Runs big in band and cup!,"Which is kind of unusual for Glamorise bras. Unless I received a ""lemon"".I ordered 3 Glamorise bras in the same order and 2 fit perfectly, but this one was huge! I ordered my usual 44C but need to exchange this one. I am hoping a 42B will fit."
5,COMFORTABLE,For the first time in over 5 years i finally have a comfortable size 38J bra. I actually sometimes have to remind myself i have one on.
3,"Functional, and fairly comfortable","This bra fit well, but it is pretty high in the front so you can't wear it with anything even slightly revealing. The bottom elastic rolls up a bit, so it isn't as comfortable as I'd hoped it would be. Shoulder straps don't dig in, so that was a definite plus. All in all, it works fine, but isn't the miracle I'd hoped it would be."
5,Glamorise bra,"this bra doesn't slide off my shoulders and has hooks in front, which is nice. My boobs still aren't perky with it, but it is a comfortable bra, and Amazon has all the sizes and colors and was about $10 cheaper than the bra store. I support brick and mortar stores, but the last time I went to a bra shop, they assured me they had my size - 56 G but when I got there, they had only a 52G and a 58 H. this was in Oct and they told me I could order a bra and it would arrive in January = only 4 months later!"
1,No Support:(,this bra is ok for sleep or hanging out at home. I would not go out in public with it.it has no support at all.
2,Most oddly fitting bra ever...,"This has to be one of the most oddly fitting bras I've ever tried. There is nothing that allows the double hook front to rest close to the breastbone and its bulk is obvious under all but the thickest tops. The bottom band, while thick and approx 1"" wide, rolled almost immediately. The cups tend to ""flatten"" and shift tissue towards the ""side-boobage"" area which is perhaps a contributing factor to the center hooks not lying flat against the breastbone. I ordered my normal size and the cups fit properly, the band is the correct size but the bra results in the uni-breast look. Very unflattering.The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of one is because the bra IS actually comfortable, it just looks bad under clothing and requires more tugging and repositioning than is desirable. This one is going back."
1,Glamorise Bra,I bought three different bras and they did not fit. They were so tight that coiuld not even close the clasp. Terrible! I do not recommend Glamorise.
1,disappointed,"I was so looking forward to getting this bra. I need one that will give me great support but this did not work out. I know my size and cup size and this bras was HUGE, way bigger than the size i know that I am and the inside of the lower bad was all discolored and if someone had worn it and then returned it. Not happy at all. So if you are going to order this bra I suggest ordering at least 1-2 sizes smaller if you want it to fit."
2,Old Style and Not Terribly Well Made,I don't care for this bra. The fit is true to size but it is thin and not particularly well made. I wore it a few times and then donated it to charity.
5,"A ""must"" reading for anyone interested in Durkheim","I have first read this book several years ago; I have now came back to it and my first impressions have just been reasserted: it is a ""must"" reading for anyone interested in Durkheim's work. The reason is simple. This is one of Durkheim's early works, published in the same year as the monumental ""Division of Labour in Society"". However, contrary to the latter monograph, Durkheim here addresses the precursors of nineteenth-century sociology, trying to identify the antecedents of modern social sciences. In a word, if you want to fully understand Durkheim's influences and aims the careful reading of this early book is unavoidable."
1,Avoid,"Got this game many years ago. It's extremely difficult, and often breaks the rules of actual chess. Ended up beating one round of the game by mistake when a power surge in the house triggered a glitch.Virtually NO music and the graphics are very bland. I've seen Atari games with a wider color pallet than this.Save your money, DO NOT BUY!!"
5,The Truth In Money; 4th ed.,"Recent MBA graduate from Xavier with whom I work read this during his studies then recommended it to me. Upon finishing the book readers will posess a thorough knowlege of: the US monetary system; the mechanics of our money system; the extent to which our money system controls our lives; the inherent problems with our money system; and the solutions that would dramatically improve life for every American.Best of all: the book is exceptionally easy to read, written in a narritive format with effective examples that make our seemingly convoluted money system seem down-right intuitive.BUY IT, READ IT, PASS IT ALONG."
4,Super GameBoy,"If your'e like me and got gipped by buying the GameBoy which has lhe smallest and worst overall screen possible, then this is the prehipheral for you. Play GameBoy and GameBoy Color games on your SNES. See all the things not possible before.Even play 2-player games without a second game cartridge, just plug a second controller into your SNES.A must have for GameBoy lovers."
4,microwaveable bear,I love the premise of this bear. My son loves to snuggle up on cold nites with a stuffed friend. The only thing that he doesn't like is that the scent is very strong to begin with. I'm hoping with time it will fade a little. The bear seems very durable and well made.
3,Fine Supplemental Reading,"This text provides a brief overview of macroeconomic issues such as purchasing power parity, adjustments to money supply, and an analysis of spot and forward rates among other topics. This text appears to be a nice supplement to a formal global finance course. However, the text is not sufficiently comprehensive to provide detailed lessons on the topic of international economics. Another source will be necessary along with this one."
2,I broke the handle! :(,"I bought one locally, hoping that the handle would not break, but then SNAP! Maybe I put too much pressure on it, but I did expect better. When the stem goes into the tang, the trowel goes from solid to scrawny, and that's where it broke. And, uhh... metal really should not snap. If anyone made a trowel with good metal, metal with ductile strength instead of the brittleness of magic snapping metal, I would buy 2 of them!P.S. I kept my receipt, so I got another one."
5,Bullet Proof!!,"The fiskars 7074 big grip transplanter is bullet proof. If you are looking for a transplanter that will last longer than you will, no doubt, get this one. In addition to is serrated edge, it has a nice sharp point on it to aid in penetrating compacted soil. The only down side is that this transplanter is nearly 12 inches long and the handle (at the end) is as big as a golf ball. I was (and still am) going to use this in stead of an E-tool for camping."
3,Maybe just as good as the dollar store one,I went with this hoping it would be more durable then the ones you can get for a buck or two at the dollar store. Its good but I may have over paid
3,"It's OK, there are better....","This visor organizer is only average. The visor doesn't have a stiff backing so it will sag and require frequent tightening. The zippers do not have ""zipper parks"" (a place to stuff the zipper pulls when the zippers are closed), so they will dangle in your line of vision at times. Granted this is minor, but it is something that I find annoying. The mesh pocket is nice, but there is only velcro in the center, for closure, so the edges hang down (into your vision). The material is nice and does look like leather. Stitching was good, although a little crooked in places. The sunglasses pocket is nicely padded but is too small to actually fit my sunglasses.I replaced this model with a unit that I found locally with a stiff back, zipper parks and better pockets (and was less expensive)."
4,Keeps the car neat!,"This visor organizer is fantastic! It is keeping our new car's console neat while still allowing us to have our ""stuff"" at our fingertips. The only thing I don't like is the mesh pocket holder for garage door opener - hard to push the opener button. We'll program the car to open the garage and do away with the opener. Then we'll have a neat mesh pocket for other necessary ""stuff""."
3,It's alright but not stellar,"No place to store CD's - unless you unzip the portion you see with a map sticking out of it and put the cases in there. I was replacing one with individual felt slots to store DVD's without the cases. Can't do that here.The zippers open very easily though, and the mesh works great for a garage door opener. I use the sunglasses spot for my gas card and gift cards.I like the adjustable straps since I have slightly larger than normal visors on my 2012 Nissan Juke and the one I was replacing was elastic straps that barely fit over it. I kept waiting for them to snap and fall off.So as long as you only have a few things to get out of the way, this works alright."
3,Practical and functional,"It is a very practical and functional, the material is of good quality, and can be used in a variety of vehicles, and also at a great price"
3,Delivery was extremely slow,"Overall, I am pleased with the item. Room for registration and insurance card, a pen and note pad, lists and directons, and a larger place for maps. The slot for sunglasses too small."
4,it does a job,"This works well but the one thing that makes it a 4 star is that sunglases won't fit in the area that is designed for them. It does hold many other things insurance cards and such and works well for small things, keeping them in one place."
5,Visor sitter,"I had no idea how hard it would be to find another visor sitter, in stores. Needless to say I had to order one on line, after getting past my frusteration...But I found that I had made a really good choice when I chose to check on Amazon.com. And found this particular visor sitter. Perfect size, really the perfect fit, for what I needed."
4,Visor Organizer,The visor organizer is a great help expecially for items I use a lot. It allows me to access my information without having to pull out a wallet and searching for what I need.
3,okay,"Not bad for the price, but note that it will shift over time and can cause some consternation when it shifts and you can't hook it back in your sun shade hook keeper thingy. Other wise every one that got these for xmas liked them."
4,Inspiring book,This is a short essay on the real location of happiness. Pieper writes this book in a sofisticated way (perhaps is the translation) but his ideas are clear and deep.
3,"camera decent, customer service bad","I loved my old coolpix and hoped to replace it with something similar and inexpensive. After a week, I thought I was doing okay with this camera until it stopped taking pictures. It wouldn't focus when turned on, gave me an error message and then turned off. I took it back to the store because I had purchased a warranty package on it, and it's been 8+ weeks now and no camera. Being a picture fanatic, it's upsetting to have to ""steal"" cameras at weddings and family gatherings and then beg for the owner to email me the pics. I miss my little coolpix 2500."
2,8 months later it's broke,"Well, at first I was impressed I got my new snappy camera with all the cool features and wow I could use AA batteries.. wait a sec.. 25 pics and I need to change batteries?!?! omg! You sooooo need rechargable batteries for this one or you will go broke!There is sluggish focus on zoom, although it does zoom tight you have to wait for it ... wait for it.. wait for it.. I got the camera because I needed to photograph small jewelry items for my eBay store.. yikes.. this one is horrible in low lighting situations either you get flash glair or the image is too dark...Print out and monitor displays ok.Guess what it's 8 months after I bought this and the thing will not focus at all, the lens won't open and it is useless to me now.. Granted I use it daily.. Maybe let it rest on Sundays..SO now I am searching for a new camera.. I'll just go pluck some more 100.00 bills off my tree...PASS ON THIS ONE!"
5,Camera,Easy to use. Sharp pictures. I love being able to use AA batteries. I can use rechargable batteries. No battery packs to worry about.
4,I had bad luck at first....,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a problem with my camera. For the most part, it took great pictures. However, if I took a picture of a light object, a white wall for instance, there was a dark circular spot in the center. It looked like a dark shadow. So I had to return the camera and I bought another one and it works fine. It takes great pictures and love it. It's easy for a beginner. Good luck!"
1,Good but minimal Flash,"Flash system isn't up to the job. Indoor pics over ten feet are dark(black even) & all are mostly red. Maybe i got a bad one, seemed like the shutter and flash don't work together. Outdoor pics are fine."
3,A little disappointed,"What I like:Size, simplicity, SD card, AA batterys, movie capablity, outdoor picture quality,What I don't like:Flash system is weak, red eye reduction doesn't work well, low light picture quality, length of time for flash recharge, outdoor fill flashThe biggest problem with this camera is the flash. Previously I owned Sonys and was expecting similiar performance but was very disappointed. I've tried serveral settings and still can not take good indoor or outdoor pictures where fill flash is required."
4,Probably Pasolini's best,"Pasolini's first film in his ""Trilogy of Life"". It tells nine separate tells from the book ""The Decameron"". All have a very ribald sense of humor and has a surprising amount (for an R rated film) of male and female nudity. Not for anyone who is easily offended but a fairly good film for those who are interested. Also there are a few really huge swipes at the Catholic Church--one story has a convent of nuns using a man to sexually satisfy all of them--and this is shown in a positive light!"
1,just vignettes,took the sleaziest of bocaccio's tales and turned it into almost funny shorts. too bad there were few attractive performers and a shortage of directorial competence
4,decomerone-veduto 1971,saw it in italy when it first came out and surprised at how much i remembered. helluva lot more fun than reading.
5,"Funny, earthy, good adaptation","Irony, satire, ribald humor. good medieval earthy Italian peasant, church folk, nobility caricatures of getting one over on the next guy. Lots of twist backs.Modern day: Roald Dahl (no n)The stories don't segue, they just start and end.Blunt, upfront, in your face tales of human nature that has survived the centuries since the book was first written during the time of the plague.Lots of sexual innuendos, body parts shown so not recommended for kids. Or for the up-tight.The book is terrific, short tales, 100 of them, that can be spread over days so as not to overdose. turn it off, do something else, watch over several nights.Really terrific makeup gives a glimmer of dental health back in those days."
4,No beauties parading,"What makes Pasolini's movies different fundamentally is deploying the average-looking artists to perform, as cinematography is a parade of beauties customarily.Very average looking near pimply teen-actors play sex-peppered middle ages Italian stories perfectly, but a viewer supposed something more from a scandalously famousSalo - Criterion Collectioncreator.Probably, an Australian-produced DVD is short of something."
2,"8, 10, whatever...","It is very odd that we can just lose parts of films into the ether. People who have nobley gone out and done their research, seeking out Passollini with a sincere curiosity are being rewarded with a misleading, partial work, presented as the whole. Is this the work of the prudish puritans, insensitive capitalists or a natural disaster? Who knows.What we do know is that the DECAMERON was clearly based on the number ten, not eight. Ten stories, as the original book has ten narrators, each telling ten stories. Passollinni even divided the film up three and seven to relflect the three men and seven women who told the stories in the book. Important? Maybe not.What is significant is that part of the movie is missing! and Passollini's statement, and of course he was making a statement, is incomplete."
3,not in English... subtitles only...,"I am too lazy to read subtitles... Also this is NOT The Decameron... it is merely a few selected stories from the book. The back story isn't there which is a shame. I do like it though, but I have to watch it several times to get the whole thing since I am reading the whole time!"
1,Was Pasolini Really Necessary?,"Like most of Pasolini's self-indulgent, grotesque, largely pointless, and badly made films, virtually any five minutes of The Decameron is sufficient to induce a raging migraine. But don't have pain killers on hand when you view it. You could easily O.D. before the first half-hour is out."
3,mediocre,"This CD sounds like a good idea, but on hearing it I was disappointed. The string quartet doesnt seem enough for a lot of these songs, maybe with a few more instruments in there it could work. It also seems, like many other string quartet tribute CDs, that these people playing the songs are not fans of the band, they don't seem to get into the music, or understand what makes it great. This CD is only nescassary for hardcore smiths fans that already have their albums."
3,a little odd,"Uh, this is wierd. It is like Morrissey and the Smiths covering Metalica. It just doesn't fit. Even so, for the hardcore Smiths fan it is worth the buy. Back To The Old HOuse was enjoyable, but I would suggest that you listen to the versions of other artists. And who chose the playlist? Crappy at best."
3,Worked for The Cure tribute not for The Smiths,"The String Quartet's tribute to The Smiths doesn't quite work as well as the tribute to The Cure. Maybe it's because the music from The Cure is much more colorful and has more layer and works wonderfully well with string instruments. However, without Morrisey's voice the string music doesn't work well."
3,"Not too bad, if you like this kind of music","First, it should be noted that most of the songs in this album sound similar. In fact, the final track (""Triple Dutch""), sounds like snipets from ""Double Dutch Bus"" cobbled together with a few transitional chords. The one exception to this rule is the title track, where you hear the singer in what one might call a normal singing voice.That having been said, if you like this style of music, ""Children of Tomorrow"" is a decent album. Most of the songs have a nice beat. Needless to say, ""Double Dutch Bus"" is the best song on the album."
1,Terrible Experience...,"I purchased this flash and used it ONCE before it stopped firing completely. I contacted the seller and they exchanged it for a brand new one. After using the new flash TWICE, it did the exact same thing - except this time it stopped firing right in the middle of a friend's wedding I was shooting. Seems to me this thing is a P.O.S. ... I have contacted Sakar and hope they'll remedy the situation, but I won't trust this as anything but a back up flash in the future ... maybe not even that!"
2,linhminy,"This product for Canon hum!!!!!!......realy I can't talk, some time it's hard to use.sometime not enoug light, the pics I took too dark.sometime too much light, even I set it autofocus.if I have more money let go up pick Canon light,I hope it good then it many many.......time."
3,3 and 3/4,"This is my first Laymon novel which I picked up on a lark at the book store. From reading reviews, I probably should have started with something else to get his very best work. As for this story, I thought it was good. I have read a lot of horror novels, and this one falls pretty much in the middle of the pack. I read through it easily, the characters were interesting enough, and the ending was a bit flat. It was enough to make me enjoy it, but it won't be one I'll want to pick up and read again and again. I think I will search out The Cellar and The Traveling Vampire Show so I can get a real idea of what Laymon was all about."
3,LAYMON FAN FOR YEARS,"I am a big Laymon fan and having just read this book has renewed my thirst for his work. I found this novel to be weird, suspensful, gory but the ending is truely lame. Throughout the whole story you are on the edge of your seat wondering who will be the next victim and where the villan will appear next. The last couple of chapters spoil it all though. This is yet another pulled from the ""unpublished"" box and put in print after Mr Laymons death. Unfortunately after reading it you can see why it wasnt published. It has an unfinished feel to it and I am sure if he were still alive the ending would be completely different. So although the ending was lame I feel the novel is worth the read."
3,Strange Laymon,"This is such an odd book. It reminded me of a printed version of one of those Shlocky low-budget horror movies from the early 80's. But in a good way. It's got charm. It's got character. The story deals with an awkward, nerdy outcast named Melvin, who calls himself the Magnificent Melvin, and even has a shiny satin robe with that embroidered on the back! He is obsessed with resurrecting the dead. He tries dozens of rituals and potions and scientific experiments, until finally...you guessed it, it finally works. It's kind of a twist on the Frankenstein story, mixed with concepts of Haitian voodoo zombie myths. The power goes to his head and all hell breaks loose in the small town where he lives. Finally Melvin must face off against the girl he loves but has rejected him.This is early Laymon. Minor, but fun. Some of the dialog is quite funny."
3,Not Among the Best Laymon,"Being one of my top 5 all-time authors, this Richard Laymon book isn't one of his better ones. In fact, it ranks among his worst... which is actually better than most other horror authors. However, the villain is not very interesting and the ending is very rushed. If you want classic Laymon that is currently available in stores, try IN THE DARK or ISLAND. The other thing that bothered me is the copy editing. This book has been re-released numerous times so there is no reason for all the spelling errors. This isn't Richard Laymon's fault. The guys over at Leisure Books shouldn't be giving this material to the interns to edit."
2,Hit? Miss? Miss...,"A man resurrects a lady, repeatedly has sex with her and wishes he were with another woman. I suppose I only made it as far as I did with this story because I wanted to know what made this guy tick. Not the character but the author. He's supposed to be the best horror author ever. To me he's ""shocking"" to the degree that he takes things out of the ordinary and places it into everyday life as any good horror author should be able to. But it's not something that's entertaining or that I'd want to spend days trying to finish. It's just not for me. I've given enough to Mr. Laymon."
2,Better Off Dead!,"Not one of Laymon's best efforts! It's difficult to care about the ""live"" characters and the ""resurrectees"" are a joke! I have enjoyed the other Laymon books I've read, but this one is a stinker! I give this book 2 stars only because even at his less than best, he still writes a readable book. If you have never read Laymon don't start with this one!"
1,Too vulgar for me,"should have read the reviews better. This was my first Richard Laymon book. Personnaly I don't care for books that use vulgar language. Read to the 2nd page of the story, ""F*** Dexter Pollock"" stopped me cold, trashed it. $7.99 wasted."
5,VERY POWERFUL,AFTER READING THIS BOOK...WE KNEW WE HAD TO HAVE THE AUTHOR ON OUR SHOW THE RANDALL REPORT.THE BOOK TAKES YOU INTO A WORLD OF A WOMEN FINDING HERSELF AND DEPENDING ONLY ON HER SELF TO MAKE CHANGE IN HER LIFE.THEN ON TOP OF THAT....HER STORY OF SURVIVAL COMING FROM HER OWN MOUTH.......HAD LISTNERS OF THE RANDALL REPORT IN AWE. MORE THAN A HALF A MILLION PEOPLE DOWNLOADED THE SHOW. THAT SHOWS YOU THE POWER OF PASSION FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN.GOD BLESS THE CHILD WHO HAS GOT HIS OWN.[...].BRJ / THE RANDALL REPORT
3,Slippery When Wet,I think this movie was pretty good for a guy of 20 Bruce Brown his first film and only $5000 to get it done good on you well done.
1,wrong 'Slippery When Wet!' :-{,"Y is this the wrong movie? Because I was looking fo the one staring SONNY LANDHAM aka 1} Bill Ashley, 2} Tex Miller. A porn movie made back in the 70's ! ! I'am a big fan of Mr. Landham's and am trying to have all of his movies. Will keep trying!"
2,Doesn't fix the errors of the first edition,"When the first edition of this book came out, it was a breath of fresh air. It carved a niche in the market by covering not just baseball players but baseball people. But it also had loads of mistakes. I had looked forward to the second edition hoping that the factual errors would be fixed. Unfortunately, very few of them were fixed. Incredibly, this book still clings to myths such as the story of Ford Frick attaching an actual asterisk to Roger Maris' home run record. Dewey and Accocella's writing is certainly more consistent than that of competing volumes, so it is unfortunate that they didn't take advantage of the opportunity a second volume presented them to fix the mistakes that are almost inevitable in a first edition. Also, some of ther additions/subtractions are puzzling - why was Dusty Baker in the first volume and not in this volume when his baseball career has only gotten more significant since the first edition?"
2,It doesn't hit for average.,"Ok, I didn't have any high expectations when I purchased this book. After all, any project with Jerome Holtzman involved is going to be hit or miss. Unfortunately, this one misses much more than it hits.I've always heard that some of the greatest stories don't come from the superstars. Sometimes, they are found in the lesser stars or the ones who had just a brief moment in the spotlight. Unfortunately, many of these players and their experiences are sacrificed for long-winded accounts of players that had been written about in excess over the years.Don't get me wrong -- there is some interesting information here. However, I've found a number of errors in dates, statistics and references. In addition, the book seems to have been rushed to print without the benefit of thorough proofreading.The good thing? It's fairly inexpensive. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for here."
4,Great Sound Cd's,"I was waiting for this album on cd but HOT PRODUCTIONS RELEASED IT, I think in 1994, but one of the best songs (to me) Together, comes EDITED (shorter than in Lp)WHY ? WHY ? I DON'T UNDERSTAND, so when I saw the cd from GETDISCONNECTED Company I thought It has to come as in the long play 5 min 27 seconds long, what a big surprised is the same edition of Hot Productions, well the only difference is the bonus track (hold your horses 12""). It's too bad because we hope to hear the cd as the album COPLETE. Anyway I already have this song from the Original Long Play, as say the others buy The Best Of."
3,Amusing Sherlock-Holmes-style mysteries.,"Charles Darwin's grandfather Erasmus Darwin is the protagonist in this collection of three separate stories. In them, Erasmus uses deductive reasoning and his powers of observation, a la Sherlock Holmes, to penetrate three mysteries which at first blush appear to involve the supernatural. At the same time, matters are not so simple, because Sheffield's backdrop is a fantasy England where supernatural explanations cannot necessarily be ruled out . . . The first episode is not so great--Darwin comes off as only slightly brighter than average. But the episodes which follow are engaging and interesting, well worth the read. Sheffield is a skilled practitioner who holds the reader's attention. I enjoyed the book, but wound up feeling slightly disappointed that Darwin, billed as ""arguably the greatest Englishman of the 18th century,"" is not even more witty and brilliant."
3,Marsh Madness,"I picked this book up on the ""new"" shelf at my library knowing nothing about it or the author. I was delightfully pleased with this light mystery. I enjoyed the down-to-earth cousins who wrestled with everyday trials and tribulations. It wasn't compelling, but the characters were delightful. It was just fun!"
4,A Sense of Place - Marsh Madness,"If you like stories set in the South, you will enjoy Marsh Madness since the descriptions of coastal island life and culture are ""right on the money"". The trio of authors, writing under the pseudonym of Caroline Cousins, really are cousins who grew up on a coastal island in or near Charleston, SC, and their feel for the people and the dialogue show their love of the South. The mystery itself is fun, has a few twists in it and there is a satisfying ending; however, the sense of place appealed to me more than anything else. If you want a quick read, one worthy of taking to the beach on a hot summer day - or conversely, curling up inside on a snowy day - then I think you might enjoy ""Marsh Madness""."
3,proofreaders please,"The book is fun, but sections are out of place. How hard can it be to get the pages in order? I would love to have a corrected copy. This carelessness has dampened my enthusiasm for the third book."
4,good detailed game,"When I first played this game I couldn't figure anything out. It may take a lot of playing but eventually you will figure it out. If you like games that get into a lot of detail you will love this game. This game is a ""sit down and play for weeks"" kind of game. Graphics are not good but it was never made for graphics it was made for you to think."
3,STANDARD HILL/SPENCER STUFF,"This is a funny film. But truly not the best of Terence Hill and Bud Spencers careers. The plot is about a truck driver (bud) and his brother (terence) who is a navy lieutenant have to stop a group of local hoods from taking over miami in and organized crime. Many funny moments....like when it shows bud spencer dressed up as a baby in a ""moomoo""! But its too bad for americans who think Crime Busters, Go for it, and Odds and Evens are terence and buds best films because they definatley are not! thier best films are Altrementi ci Arrabbiamo (Watch out, We're Mad!), Io sto con gli ippopotami (I'm for the Hippopotamus) and of course Porgi l'altra guancia (Don't Turn the Other Cheek.)"
4,One of their best!,"Along with Crime Busters and Go For It, this is one of the ""musts"" of Spencer/Hill's modern films for their fans. As usual, Spencer is involved in a convoluted set-up by Hill, eventually recruiting him (he plays a famous but retired gambler) to help capture a group of swindlers. All the expected comedy elements are here--many episodes of funny slapstick adventures and fights in diverse settings, including Hill and Spencer fighting each other, and a drunken Spencer COMPLETELY destroying a bar. We also meet Hill and Spencer's ""father"" and get a hint of how Hill got so conniving! A must for fans! Card playing sequences are on a par with the classic scene from Trinity is Still My Name."
2,Not much of an Hill/Spencer film,"I would only recomend this film to very serious Hill/Spencer fans. The story itself is OK, but Hill & Spencer arn't half as funny as they're known to be from other films. 2 stars."
4,"If your an Iz fan, you can't go wrong!","I love Iz, and anything he does is going to be great, I just wish that there was nothing that repeats on his other albums."
5,Alone in IZ World,"Knowing the history and hearing the beautiful renditions in his clear and poignant style, I cried."
4,Over the rainbow,"Ordered this for just one song - Over the Rainbow (from 50 First dates) - but really enjoy the whole cd, even though most of it isn't in english. The melodies are great and very calming"
1,Dissappointed,"Don't know why this guy was so lauded. I purchased two cd's of his and they are not inspirational or fun to listen to at all. Plus, he is so big that you can hear his labored breathing on some of his tracks. Tried listening twice to each cd - what a waste of money. And the songs are blah......."
4,"Wonderful Music, Amazing Man.","The main reason I bought this albumn was the YouTube video sent to me of ""IZ"" sing ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"". This collection shows he was so much more than that. Do yourself a favor and enjoy this Albumn."
5,Alone in IZ World,"Alone in IZ WorldGreat CD, This musician has an awesome approach to his style of Hawaian music"
4,Beautiful Music,I visited Hawaii for the first time and learned about IZ. His music is unique and so easy to listen too. I would give this CD as a gift and would recommend it to friends and family.
5,awesome cd,"I love the music on this tape. We used Over the rainbow at my mom's funeral, and it was lovely."
5,Unlike anything you have heard before,IZ's music is beautiful and unique. You don't have to be a big fan of Hawaiian music to love this album. An appropriate gift for anyone or a treat for yourself. You will fall in love with this music.
4,There's that rainbow!,"I love the style of music and listen to it while I'm just pantering around the house. HI find it very relaxing. However, when the song ""Over the Rainbow"" comes on, I have to sit down and focus on it. I think his version of that song is beautiful. I just sit and listen and enjoy!"
4,Listening to IZ in his world,"Iz' version of Over the Rainbow was used on TV shows, etc.because it is just so different and wonderful. I bought theCD just for this song. I like the rest of the CD, but I justplay OTR over and over. Its the best. His voice was just sofull and perfect."
4,Happy Valentine's Day,pretty cool ... was listening to Pandora and IZ's version of Somewhere Over the Rainbow came on. Remembered my girlfriend loved it so I clicked on Amazon and have a nice extra valentine's day gift for her :)
4,Wonderful Music,"I bought this CD with only one intention and that was for 1 song. ""It's a wonderful world"" (somewhere over the rainbow) Israel does a great job on the remake from Judy Garland's original song...If you are familar with his music I highly recomend buying this peaceful CD!"
4,Over The Rainbow/Wonderful World,"I have not heard the entire CD, but I will be searching for it.I'm writing this because I live in Phoenix, but have the computer on to ""The Fabulous 690"" out of Los Angeles.They played this song of Iz's. It was beautiful. I stopped typing an email to a friend, just to enjoy it. I'd never heard of him before.It was sweet, gentle and rhythmic. I admit I kind of got a little teared up listening to it. I've not heard this kind of version of ""Over The Rainbow"" before.Look, if this one cut is that good, the whole CD must be good!"
3,only reason,I bought this cd because I loved the rendition of Over the Rainbow...love it...the rest of the music is not to my liking but did not know for sure if I would like any other songs...so I did purchase with that in mind but wanted the CD anyway..
5,Great but please translate/explicate/elucidate the lyrics,"Of course this is a great album, no doubt about it. I have one request, though. Because most of the songs, including their titles, are in Hawaiian, it is very hard to know what Israel is singing. In order to learn more about Hawaii, preserve the fascinating language, and make this album more than just melody, there should be a little translation offered. I suggest maybe a link to a website with the lyrics in English, or a simple word list, or something. I suspect that the embarrassing reality is so few people speak Hawaiian that even the producers don't know the words Israel is using. What a shame! I, myself, would like to learn, but this album does not teach. Perhaps there are those who would say one must simply ""feel"" Israel's message, rather than interpret it via a dictionary, but come on. This is a dying language. Let's bring it to the masses and keep it alive!"
4,brings tears to my eyes...,"we bought this cd while on vacation in hawaii (maui). i was familiar with ""over the rainbow"" and knew we would enjoy it. what i wasn't familiar with was the power that ""bruddah iz"" would have to make me cry. his voice is so beautiful and i was just blown away with the simplicity of the entire cd. our children (ages 10 and 7) liked ""the big man's"" music as well. i'll treasure this one always; it's hawaii!"
4,Smooth voice,"Unbelievable smooth voice. Have this & ""facing the future"". The wife & I love it and have had family & friends looking for it."
5,Alone in IZ World,"IZ touched the hearts of so many around the world with his beautiful music ... his mana (spiritual power) was the greatest! There is no one song that stands out as all of his music is mezmerizing. No matter which cd you puchase, you will love them all. IZ said at a concert we attended while living on Kauai ... ""the Hawaiian music is aloha (love) that comes from our heart from God through our hands and our mouth and out to you in songs."" Listen to his music, and you too will feel love in your heart. By Sharon Miller"
4,Alone in IZ World,"I really enjoy this music in this CD, however I wished that there was alittle more backround music with his singing. I really enjoy purchasingfrom amazon for the quick and accurate handling of this product. I give amazon a 5 star rating for their service."
2,review IZ,"The music is great but some of the quality is lacking the CD has several skips on it,even on the first play."
2,Alone in IZ world,"I have rated this cd with 2 stars just for the song Over the rainbow. The other songs on this cd, are songs that don't knock me of my feet. The hawaian songs are just not my thing. The two other English songs [ starting all over again and In this life ]are ok but really, deserve no prize. I've heard the song Over the rainbow for the first time because of a commercial here in the Netherlands. And this version of Over the rainbow is so special and beautiful that I was willing to buy the whole cd, just for this one song. Greetings from Martin"
2,Over The Rainbow,This music is good for the soul. How sad that this great talent is no longer with us but what a legacy he left.
1,Major Disappointment from The Mountain Apple Company,"The music is terrific. However, the music will ONLY play in an old-fashioned CD Player with the CD mounted in it. The music will NOT PLAY (the files cannot even be found!) on a PC or MP3 player. (I had to go sit in my car to listen to it!!!)I believe The Mountain Apple Company is part of Apple Computer, and I am really surprised (shocked, actually) that they are selling music that cannot be played on the most popular media players of all time (personal MP3 Players and PC- or Mac-based media players)."
1,only a rainbow,"The Cd isn't worth the money -liked only over the rainbow.he has a beautiful voice, bad selection of songsCD was in good shape, seller OK also"
5,Alone in IZ World,"This man has an abosolutly amazing voice, one that allows you to sit down, relax and drift into a world of thought."
1,Not worth it.,"I bought this book so I could freshen up my geometry skills for the GRE. It is full of mistakes! Nothing like trying to check your answer to a problem and finding that the key is answering a different question. This was not a mathematical mistake. The problem restated in the key was different than the practice problem. Also, I found mistakes in some of the if-then exercises. Looked over it for about 20 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong, rereading the lesson and looking at the example. The example was wrong! They showed the correct answer, but the work to get to it was not completely correct. Awful editing. I finally quit using this book and used my ETS GRE prep book and focused on their math review."
4,Geometry for any idiot is true,"This book is perfect, it has simple explanations, good diagrams, and lots of samples and problems to assist in your learning and development of Geometry.Worth it if you need a refresher or if you are about to start studying geometry."
1,Another defective disc...,"As said in previous reviews, a lot of the discs are defective, including mine. When used with a normal DVD player, it won't let you watch the show... it just keeps taking you to the trailers section. However, when I viewed the disc on my Playstation 2, it worked fine for the most part. The only problem is that it repeatedly asked me to confirm the parental controls whenever a new menu or scene loaded. This is a great show, but I would suggest waiting until Bandai fixes the problem before buying this. Until then, .hack//Legend of Twilight can be viewed on Cartoon Network Friday nights starting at 1:00 AM (yes, unfortunatley, its at an obscure time slot)."
4,Welcome back to the World!,"It is a safer, kinder place. Yeah, right. Shugo and his twin sister, Rena, are new to the game and have won two legendary characters, Kite and Black Rose. They meet and make many friends but also run into dangerous monsters. High level monsters that seem to be appearing in low level areas.Is it a bug or is something more happening behind the scenes? The two characters they have won are not your run of the mill characters. And as the ununsual events continue to happen more and more people are starting to notice.Maybe it IS just a bug in the program? Right."
1,Uhm... yea...,"This was a very...very...very... uh... well... interesting DVD. Let's see... how can I say this uhh... IT SUCKED. I'm the type of person who usually loves everything I watch, I love almost every genre and its easy for me to like things. Especially anime. If I say an anime is bad...its pretty dang bad. This anime is about 2 siblings who win 2 legendary skins for the online game, .HACK. They won the skins of 2 legendary characters who beat the game. Even though the sister is excited (her skin is Black Rose, yea, you know who I mean .HACK video-gamers), the brother (he has Kite's skin) well... isn't excited. It's just a pretty lame show that insults the amazing video games and the OTHER .HACK anime which is a masterpiece. If you really--and I mean REALLY--want to check out this series, I reccomend the manga; it's MUCH better."
4,Oh So Cute,"This is the first .hack// series I've watched and so far I really enjoy it. The character designs are adorable, and the animation is pleasantly bright and colorful without ever looking garish or overdone. The upbeat opening and soothing closing music go well with the general feel of this series. Each episode has a good amount of action and comedy mixed in to keep the viewer entertained. I found the story fairly easy to follow even without prior .hack// knowledge. Overall a very cute, pleasant, and easy to follow series. I found it to be a nice break from more intellectually heavy and dark anime series."
3,"Show is good, dvd features were lacking.","mediocre rating, not b/c the show was bad. i have enjoyed the .hack series. but i was expecting more out of the dvd version. the english voices are poor (typical) i favor the Jap w/subtitles. there arent any decent preview trailers for other shows. and it didnt have storyline or concept art feature that i enjoyed on the .hack/sign discs."
2,RENT IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT.,"The Charactors and story have potential but rent it first. If you can't watch it, it doesn't count for much. The discs don't play on all machines, some problem in the coding. Bandai knows of the trouble with the discs but hasn't said anything about it or if they'll be doing anything about it. So be warned."
4,Soulful Williams at the Smithsonian,"Joe Williams here performs with a supportive backing trio at a Jazz at the Smithsonian event in the early '80s. Fine production values, and the singer is smoking hot on the primarily bluesy up-tempo tunes, and enticing and poised on the few ballads. Highly recommended."
2,Jane Misunderstood,"Lev Raphael's review said it best, so I'll add only this. Jane Austen didn't write this novel as a romance novel, but as a parody of one. This irony escaped the screenwriter as well as Gillian Anderson. In the book, Tillney's feelings for Catherine remain ambiguous to the end (note to readers: a spoiler comment follows) -- does he propose because he loves her or because his father forced him to court her and he now feels bound by honour to marry her?Jane Austen was so much more than a romance novelist -- why do adaptations insist on reducing the complexity of her? I agree with other reviewers -- for the real Jane, try Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility, and the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth. Other adaptations fall too far short."
4,Northanger made understandable,"I have been a Jane Austen fan since I was a teenager (I am now retired), yet never enjoyed Northanger Abbey until now. Finally, someone has made this story pleasurable. At last the heroine, although still somewhat foolish with her overactive imagination, is believable."
3,Great Re-telling,"I loved this re-telling of Northanger Abby. I first saw it on television and was amazed and how well I loved the charcters. The only small problem I had was that the video version cut out small parts. However, they were not important scenes and would only be caught by those who had seen the 'full' televised version. Still a great movie were I completly loved Cathrines' innocence, and Mr. Tilneys' charisma."
2,Disappointing,"It was a decent attempt, but it left out too much of the book to make it worthwhile. A Jane Austin production should never be done in 90 minute episodes; too much is lost."
2,What?,"Just not well put together, chopped in pieces, story lines lost....... keeps you wondering, really what's the point??? Characters were good though, I commend them."
3,Not the best Jane Austen,"This is a very good movie for everyone who like Jane Austen, but I really prefer Pride and Prejudice or Sense and sensibility."
3,Interesting,"For someone who has not read the book, the movie was very interesting with an unexpected twist! And as always, Jane Austen delivers a happy ending!"
3,NO SUBTITLES!!,"Of course this movie is awesome and well-done. I have it on VHS and wanted the DVD version so I could turn on the subtitles, but, even though they say they have them, subtitles are missing. Grrrrrr. I'm thinking these might be bootleg copies."
1,sound quality poor,"This movie aired on my local PBS station Sunday night (2/14) and I found that I was unable to view it. Again, the music drowns out the dialog (I have found this in previous PBS adaptations) I found myself straining to hear the words and wishing the music would just stop. I wonder if anyone is viewing the film before it is released to the public. Is this poor editing or just someone who is enamored with the musical score? I don't intend to purchase the DVD for this very reason."
2,i do not understand what your asking me for,the dvd had many bad spots where it would say no signal it also happened on other dvd i have purchased through you mostly i have to wash them
2,Northanger Abby,"Wish, I hadn't wasted my money on this. The characters were so shallow and at the end I was waiting for the story to have something more. So disappointed. Would not reccommend this version."
3,"Beware, this is a cut version of Northanger Abbey (2007)","Of the 3 adaptations produced by ITV in 2007, Northanger Abbey was the best (or the least bad to be honest). I have received the DVD now and I notice to my disappointment, anger and outrage that PBS is cheating its public by selling a cut version of the adaptation. PBS had acknowleged it was going to broadcast a cut version, but it had also promised that the full and complete version would be in the DVD, and that is NOT true. They are selling the cut version only. So beware, do not order this DVD unless you want only an incomplete version. Furthermore, it is advertised as close-captioned, and that is not true, there are no subtitles nor close caption in this DVD"
4,Missing scenes?,"I absolutely love this adaptation, but I am disappointed that there are missing scenes in the DVD such as Mrs. Allen and Catherine in the tearoom, Catherine's bathtub fantasy, and Miss Tilney and Catherine's conversation to name a few. Though they were short scenes that don't take away from the overall plot, I expected to get the entire movie for what I paid for. I still love the DVD, but I didn't expect to miss parts from the movie."
1,PBS Cut Version in US DVD Release-Lost 7 Minutes (or more?),"i very much enjoyed this film. the actors were great, the production well done. i've purchased many austin film adaptations, but on principle, i won't purchase this because the dvd released in the states is cut by 7 minutes (or more?), as compared to the british dvd release. who knows what we've missed because some idiot at PBS has some power to abuse and thinks they know better. (the new film adaptations are generally too short as it is to do justice to the novels, except maybe the new sense and sensibility which seemed well done in this respect.) but i find this so infuriating. i hate this practice. thus, no purchase. hopefully some other executive at PBS will do their job and correct this stupid error."
3,Disappointed! Cut Scenes,"I join the other reviewers who were disappointed about the missing and cut scenes that were un-aired on PBS, but a part of the original airing on ITV in the UK. I purchased Persuasion, which is a part of the same Masterpiece Classic series, and the un-aired scenes were included on the DVD. Therefore, I fully expected this adaptation to include those scenes and I am unsure why the few minutes were left out.Overall, however, the adaptation was quite good, if a bit rushed, especially at the end. Northanger is a hard book to adapt for the screen, as the past BBC version exemplifies. This version is very enjoyable with the two leads capturing the spirit of the roles, and the atmosphere a good balance between the ridiculous and the mysterious."
2,Danger alert: 30 minutes cut!,"Just a quick note -- I went over to Amazon.com.uk -- Northanger Abbey is 120 minutes in UK -- in US, only about 90 minutes.... No wonder it felt a bit clunky in the Masterpiece Theatre version!"
4,Northanger Abby,I always enjoy differing versions of Jane Austens novelsand this one was very good.Acting was good and story line is very close to the book.
3,Very mixed results,"This version is very well cast and well acted. Unfortunately it struggles in two ways. First, it is very abridged and seems so. Second, the cinematography frequently devolves in to stupid, ""reality""-show-style camera waggling. There is even one point near the end where the camera strangely vibrates. What are things coming to when Masterpiece Theater abandons the principles of visual beauty and coherence? We truly are in a dark age of cinematography."
4,Too short,"The movie stays pretty much true to the book. However, I would have liked to see the relationship between Catherine and Mr. Thorpe develop a little more. He is a lot more crafty and persistent in the book. I would have also liked to have seen more time alloted to Northanger Abbey. I was just getting the feel of it when it was time to move on. The ending was a little abrupt. However, all in all I liked the movie and would recommend it to friends."
4,Closer to the book,We have two copies of the video from different sources. This copy is truer to the book and much more agreeable. It still has some seens that did not happen in the book.
2,boring for Austen,"I have loved all the other Austen productions, some better than others, I could not get ""into"" this. It was too fast and yet quite boring to watch..will not be watching this time and time again as I do the other DVD's.....the casting was not great for some of the main characters and I think that had a lot to do with the negative opinions I have of this movie..thanks."
2,No Pride & Prejudice,"This movie was poorly acted and does not compare to Pride & Prejudice, Emma, or any of the others. I would skip this."
2,Okay version,I don't think this version was as good as the version with Peter Firth playing Mr. Tilney. There wasn't a lot of chemistry between the main characters.
1,Disappointed,"Although the acting was good enough, Jane Austen's original story is so cut down in this movie that you feel rushed through the plot the entire time. I kind of regret buying this movie because I don't know if I'll watch it again."
4,"Northanger Abbey, Masterpiece","I liked this adaptation pretty well, The fantasy scenes where Catheriine imagines scenes from supposed novels she is reading is a little overstressed and doesn't really add to the story or characters. They could have taken those scenes out and included more of the actual story. I really enjoyed Mr. and Mrs. Allen's characters. it's a fun, though not very deep, representation of Jane Austen's novel."
3,Good,Enjoy all Masterpiece productions....this one I had missed so glad to have it in my collection..worth the watch....keep them coming....
4,I am sorry to hear it's a cut version,"I really think this is one of best Jane Austen adaptations ever. I was sorry to hear that it is cut from the original. Unfortunately, none of them ever compares to the books because the books are, of course, masterpieces depicting the truest truths of human behavior. I highly recommend listening to unabridged audio versions that give them life but don't take away from the beautiful language."
5,Excellent!!!,One of the very best of Austen's movies......got to watch and see the movie. You will not regret owning this video.
4,VERY GOOD!!!,A VERY GOOD MOVIE AND ENTERTAINING. I AM A BIG FAN F BBC MOVIES . WOULD DEFINATELY WATCH AGAIN . WOULD RECOMMEND.
3,"OK, but not great","This should have been 2 hours long rather than 90 min. That way the producers could have put the whole story in it--as is, it ends rather abruptly."
2,I couldn't understand what this book was about,"I thought it was a monster book about giant mutant gars. Instead it was about some weird sentient toxic cloud that comes out of the lake, turning the gar into monsters before threatening the people.Terrible characters, especially the main character who is a jerk."
2,Max Factor on Amazon is getting Cheesy,"First, they charge an arm and a leg for the stuff, when you do get it, it's old and out of date, not creamy. Get the Maybeline, much better!! Didn't know they had it in white."
1,"it was old, hard as a rock",it was old and hard as a rock.............called number on product and it was OLD.MAX FACTOR ERACE COVER UP 221 white
1,Not what I expected,"When I ordered this item, I expected a gun-type accessory to use with certain games, like in the picture. What I got was a game. I was VERY disappointed when I received it. Now I need to know how I can get a Super Scope gun accessory. I feel misled although I admit I was not very knowledgeable in the first place of what I was buying. My son hasn't played it yet so I can't rate how fun it is."
5,Best Book Ever,I am so happy with this book. The pictures are fantastic and the information is very helpful and thorough. I will be buying more titles by this author.
5,Detailed Reference for Carving Wood,The author has done an excellent job to give detailed information critical for art. Floyd Sholtz is no doubt a perfectionist!This purchase was great buy!
1,This was the practice run--save your money,This DVD is of shows they did when they obviously were developing the material they later used for the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. The camera work is horrible and it's the same material for the most part. These guys are great and I love 'em...but they received bad advice when they were told to sell this. It just hurts their credibility.
3,Not bad but unoriginal,"All the Ron white jokes, most of the Jeff Foxworthy jokes and about half the Bill Engvall jokes I've seen on Blue Collar Comedy Tour 1-3 and/or their own comedy specials, and they had better delivery than what's on this DVD.I recommeng looking into those DVDs rather this one."
4,Not enough information,"As it turns out, the description of the item could have been clearer. The included mounting bracket doesn't, unless you happen to have a bike that's designed for this specific mount.It took me a while longer than it should have to figure this out. There isn't so much as a half-sheet of instructions or a picture of what the reflector looks like mounted. So, which side is ""up"" and which end of the bracket is supposed to go on the bike-- well, let it be a challenge to you....now all I have to do is get a mounting bracket for the mounting bracket, and I'll all set. Ack."
1,TigerDiect ships an inferior substitute,"TigerDirect does not ship a ""Cables to Go"" brand product, but rather a cheap knock-off. Do not buy from this merchant."
5,The Best Console Turrican!,"Without a doubt the best Pc/Amiga action series of all time arrives on the snes in top form with an entirely new game and graphics engine to boot, if you have a snes you will NEED this and I mean it.This game is up their with Donkey Kong Country, Super Mario World, Super Metroid and all the other classics.By it now though because it is and was very rare."
5,Super Turrican 2,"This is a last generation SNES game made by ocean. Pre rendered graphics and awesome arcade voice for item power ups add to the games action packed arcade style of game play. It doesn't really follow traditional Turrican titles as the levels differ in style such as mode 7 flying levels and vehicle rides, while the other Turricans let you free roam. It still has the same high quality sound track as the other titles. In a chronological order this Turrican falls last in the series. Super Turrican 2 is a must have for SNES collectors or someone wanting a very challenging and very well put together action game."
1,Terrible phone holder,My phone had to have fallen out of the clip about 15 times before I finally lost it completely while hiking in the woods. Get something that will secure your phone better than this.
4,"Funny Stuff, but peculiar","Two older movies wrapped in one dvd. How can you go wrong with John Candy, Chevy Chase, Dan Akroyd and Demi Moore? Well, these are quirky movies with alternating funny and stupid. Maybe these won't both be your cup of tea, but if you don't laugh at either of these, there's something wrong with you."
5,Great 80's Flick,I really enjoyed these movies when they came out in the theaters. A great cast and cameos. A great way to spent a night in front of the tube...
5,An Memorable Book For All Ages,"This book, ""The Relatives Came"" by Cynthia Rylant and illustrated by Stephen Gammell, was a delight to read. I found myself smiling as I read the words that made the artwork come alive. Likewise, I found myself recollecting over the memories of the past when my relatives would come to visit. And, I felt as if I, too, were a part of this book. Having experienced growing up in a small town where you don`t see that many people, I believe that when relatives come to visit, it almost seems like Christmas. As a result, when the book expressed the joy, laughter, and celebration of family, it stirred up these memories of the past. Unquestionably, almost anyone, from children to adults, could find themselves reminiscing and longing for the fun they had when their relatives come to visit."
4,The Relatives Came--picture book,"A picture book for ages 4-7, and perfect for adults of any age, the story of family visiting brims with positive energy, and is vividly descriptive of the sights and sounds the visitors brought. ""The Relatives Came"" provides material for discussion of family roles and expectations. I sent the book to my sister after our family had come through some intense time together."
4,Great Story starter,"Can be the inspiration for many writing ideas- character sketches of family members, preparing for guests, positives and negatives of having company, missing those who live far away, family traditions, what do you all do when you get together, etc.I use it for a writing springboard for my 4th grade class."
2,Not close to Stove Top in taste,"Product is very dry if prepared as directed. Need almost twice the amount of chicken broth to get it moist. Stove Top is much better tasting and uses water, not chicken broth."
5,Kellogg's Stuffing Mix,"This is the best stuffing mix ever....those who agree, please go to [...] and sign the petition to bring this product back!! Thanks!"
3,shipping was a little slow,i cant rate the product as i havent been on the regimen long enough to make any claims. I expected to recieve the product sooner than i did.
1,Is this a case of - you get what you pay for?,I have purchased this same product from my local Whole Foods prior to this purchase which is my basis for this complaint. I have opened and tried my 1st of 6 bottles from this seller and have noticed the difference in taste and quality. The one that was sent to me was a lot thinner (dilluted) and sour tasting (like it is about to go bad) than the ones I purchased from Whole Foods. I checked the best before date and it says it does not expire until Aug 2011.
1,Lacks product information.,"I read the reviews, and the product information, but no where does it mention how many ounces are in a bottle? Or how many ounces they recommend that you take at a time? Without this information how can you decide if this is a good buy or not? Some of the powdered Acai lacks the same info. One of the top rated brands comes in a 3.5 oz zip-lock bag for about $26 inc. s/h. If my math is correct, and you take 1 teaspoonful a day, that would be about a 2 week supply. I think I am going to shop the local stores first for pricing and info."
5,Actress Uses Body Ecology,"Length:: 0:34 MinsI'm Lulu, a young up-and-coming actress. Adopting The Body Ecology Way of Life led to a radiant complexion...even helping to clear up persistent, embarrassing acne!"
2,Inconsistent,"I was initially very happy with the first 6 bottles (two batches)of this product. When I ordered and received my third batch (three bottles) a few months later I found out the liquid was severely ""watered"" down. It also didn't feel as powerful to my body as the first two orders. I really felt the difference in the first two batches.The distributor claimed it was because of the variable weather conditions in Brazil but I didn't buy that explanation. If you happen to get a bottle that contains thick liquid then you got the right batch. I won't order anymore bottles till I know I'm getting a consistent product."
3,Oh Meeeee....Well,"My wife (the Admiral) was so excited about the ACAI 100. From our investigation it's the best ACAI juice out there for the money but... but... after drinking the much (not really so bad tasting) for over a month I could not honestly see in pain difference in my joints. I always think of this type stuff as Snake Oil but tried it with good hopes! (I know there's other benefits of the Acai berry.) Good luck maybe it will work for you. If you are going to buy ACAI juice, look at the percent some of the cheaper stuff is less than 10%!"
5,Far more than I expected,"When word got around that Jay Farrar had taken a hiatus from Son Volt to complete a solo project, the first rumors made it out to be either a live album of strictly solo gigs, an album of deep-South country tunes, or even a rip-roaring rock album (he does an amazing cover of ""Born to Be Wild"" live).Happily, it's none of those things...it's as melodic and rich as the best of Son Volt and Uncle Tupelo, surreal lyrics intact, but taken far more personal. The arrangements here are pure Farrar, with keyboards and other odd instruments added by Steve Drozd (the Flaming Lips' drummer). There's honestly not a bad song on here; every time I listen to it, I find new levels of richness and beauty.I expected a quickie bedroom-recorded album, not the best CD of the year."
5,Jay is the man,"If you like SON VOLT, Whiskeytown, Uncle Tupilo, Lucinda Williams, Gillian Welch...etc this CD is a must. Jay is the man and you must bow at his feet brother.........."
4,it's a crime(a),"He has a voice ... and writes songs that can be rated among the best of them... but. Son Volt or not, there's still not much difference. Don't get me wrong, i love this, but i just felt it was lacking something, not sure what though. It's a great listen, powerful songs of social and lifestyle disenchantment and interesting arrangements, but it just lacks an edge. Maybe it's the sequencing, but when it's over you feel unready. If you're a fan you'll want this, if you're curious then it's a great buy. It's great, but should have been genius."
1,I'll Pass On This One,"Another example of an original artist misguided by corporate greed.Check out ""No Depression"" by Uncle Tupelo instead."
4,Remarkable!,"I didn't check to see, but I expect some No Depression Junkies to be a little unnerved by this open, modern, Rock sound, but I think it's great! I love Trace, but the songs deserved more space. On Sebastapol the production is clear and the playing is sparse and even funky. Sort of a modest mouse or flaming lips (Lips drummer is present here to great effect) crossed with Son Volt. I don't know yet if the songs will play into my subconscious like earlier Farrar songs, but right now it's hard to beat Barstow and Damn Shame. 4 stars for now working on 5. Barstow deserves 5."
2,A Disappointing Solo Outing,"Jay Farrar's first solo release is, unfortunately, a bit of a disappointment. There are some catchy songs, true, though nothing you haven't heard before from Farrar. The main problem, though, is that the production seems to be attempting to set Farrar's lyrics against an epic, semi-cosmic backdrop--not necessarily a bad thing, as Farrar's tourmates Varnaline demonstrate on their latest release--but what results is a muddled, over-produced mess, heavy with instrusive string arrangements and the sorts of sound effects that you thought were really neat coming from your Yamaha keyboard when you were fifteen. This is definitely one to avoid."
2,An Incredible Talent Lost in the Fray,"Nine times out of ten when groups split it just means more great music. Example Ryan Adams and Catilin Cary. Evidently this is not so with the split of Uncle Tupelo. It's all artist's license, but I know what I like. With exception of track four, ""Barstow"" with Gillian Welch, Jay's unique voice and poetry are lost on Sebastopol behind keyboards, drums, and a tambura? He seems to be desperately trying be a rock star with a voice and style that's far above the rock scene. Why can Tweedy pop toasters and ring clocks with Wilco and it seem right, yet jay's direction seem all wrong, I don't know."
3,a bit disappointing,"I don't like this album very much.Although I'm a big fan of Jay Farrar (uncle tupelo and son volt) this album is a lot like ""Farrar goes pop"".It's a shame that many, in their essence, good songs are destroyed by shrill elektronic noises.In general I reckon Farrar to be a better songwriter than his former bandbuddy Jeff Tweedy, with songs that easily match those by Richard Buckner and Ryan Adams.But these songs simply don't work for me.There are still a few marbles: ""barstool"", ""outside the door"", ""drain"" and ""dead promises"".That's a less than average score and in fact the overall rating should be 2 stars.However: these songs still are a lot better than the average popact.Popact?That's right.Anyone looking for alternative country should listen to the records Farrar made with Uncle Tupelo and Son Volt."
5,listen in bulk,please listen to jay's.....ryanadam's....spiritualized's...remyzero's......all taken together give a feeling of comfort from west to east to west coast.....look for casino-7's saloon songs....coming soon......laketahoe/barstow/slots/stateline/cigs/drinks/desert/luv
2,whiskey bottle?,"This is watered-down version of Son Volt and bares no resemblance to the great Uncle Tupelo. Studio musicians and fill-ins quash any continuity. Farrars singing voice has become progressively worse since the break-up of Tupelo and on Sebastopol, his nasal, rangeless drone varies little from track to track leaving us searching for a melody or hook of some sort among the seventeen tracks. Unfortunately, there is little here. This album plays like a dirge and is utterly depressing."
1,Please don't let those two write anymore books!,"Bad. Very, very bad! Worse, even. This could be a very good bird-cage lining material. The writers' ridiculous obsession with opals, which has stretched for several books now, is making me think they're in serious need for help. Letting them write more books like this one is NOT the answer! (and now they've added a fascination with salt and crystals, too!)I won't even go into the content of this poor excuse for a book. Enough is to say that it has nothing to do with the Krynn we know and love.Buy it if you must, but be warned! This is a series-killer"
2,Worst Dragonlance I've read thus far.,"This book was pretty weak. I didn't like the way that I was the least bit interested until one half way through the book. But I pushed on. Some of the characters were decent. I liked the elven interpreter and the mute slave. After that it was the same old same old from the Williams'. I especially couldn't figure out who the hero or even the main character was supposed to be. Granted, the book was about Takhisis, but there is not a whole lot of chaeracter development that can go the supreme being of evil. But I couldn't even figure what Sargonnas was doing. I didn't want either side to win. I also didn't like how the author referred to the irda raiding parties. In every other book the irda are a race for good. Especially in Lost Histories II. I also didn't like the conclusion. I understood but I was confused by the inaccurate telling of the reason for the cataclysm by the incredibly long lived mute human."
1,Not Worthy of Takhisis,"First things first, the book draggs; chances are, after reading the first two chapters, you'll put it down and not return. The information in this books seems as if it was pulled out of thin air, because it is completely inaccurate to Dragonlance history. With such a interesting goddess like Takhisis, it's amazing that someone could write such a horrible book. And believe me, it is horrible."
1,A terrible piece of writing.,"Boring. Writing of the darkest of all the gods is no easy task, but what has been produced is a travesty and a shame. This is a weak book with boring characters. I could never sympathize with the rebels and none of the characters clicked with me. There is nothing to be gained from reading this book, although if you have a copy of it, since it's apparently out of print, hold on to it!"
3,Ummmmm,"Well I haven't read the book, but lets put it in perspective. We have a book that deals with the blackest foulest creature in the Dragonlance, there isn't a lot of room for plot and character development. And another thing, if you are evil, a good aligned raiding party is bad. And one more thing, some of you must not know DL very well, the Irda, are what OGRES(an evil race) used to be before the gods cursed them. Sure they are good NOW, but NOW they have ISOLATED themselves!"
1,wtf,ive bought 3 copies of this cd collection and all 3 have turned up blank. so be werry about this cd
3,Great book,Very funny. I wouldn't suggest this for very small children especially if they are impressionable. Also it mentions Mickey mouse not being real.
1,Not in my house,"In the first 6 pages of the book you will find the word ""dumb"" used 3 times and the sentences, ""How'd you like me to bash your brains in, you big fat Jim?"" and ""And don't say that again, or I'll knock you on your can.""My 1st grader brought this book home from the school library - it was the first Junie B. Jones book she's ever chosen. She reads so much that I don't always look through the books she brings home, but I'd heard about these books from other parents so I decided to check it out before she read it. It only took the first several pages for me to decide she won't be reading this book."
1,Glad we didn't buy it,"I got this book from the library to give me something to read my kindergarten for her daily reading. We got through about half of it this afternoon and won't be finishing it. I'm already constantly correcting her English so reading a book where the main character uses poor English may be realistic, but not helpful to young kids. I also found I had to constantly skip over or modify words like stupid, hate, shut up, dumb, etc. Junie is just not a very good example to children her age. Even my daughter mentioned during the book ""She's not being very nice."" So at least she gets that! But we'll be looking for a book where the main character is a better example."
5,Junie B. is quite a character!,My whole family enjoys reading these books! Can't wait to read her First Grade adventures. Junie B. is a graduation Girl in May!
4,junie b. jones and her big fatmouth!,i really liked this story because it is just a good story and it shows that she opened her big fat mouth and she said something that she really could not do and she lied and could not do all those things so she went home and ran to the nursre and her mother was in there tring to get her brother to sleep and junie b. jones went in there very loud and woke up her baby brother and her mother could not find her brothers paseyfire and junie b. finds it and her mother is sorry for screaming at junie b and the next day when she went to school she was wearing three jobs and i think it is a very good story and i liked it because it teachs you not to open your mouth when you know not toi hope i did a good job on my book report but it needs to say more at the end like it needs to have at the end of the story it need to say THE END in all stories it needs to say THE END but on some booksthey all have THE END but some people they just don't do it and that's okay. THE END!
1,Inappropriate book for young readers,"While the concept may be ""cute"" for older readers, we do not encourage our 6 year old to use words such as ""hate, dumb, stupid"" or engage in name-calling. Nor do we appreciate having to define ""drunk"" to our daughter. The language is difficult for an early reader trying to grasp a barrage of new words - when the majority of the text is slang and misspoken words it is confusing. After two chapters I had to tell my child we would be returning the book, as it was inappropriate."
4,Childhood in a cartridge,I loved this game as a kid and it honestly hasn't lost anything with me. I still enjoy it. No SNES game collection would be complete without it.
4,The second set is indeed one of the GREAT Dead sets!,If you were only to hear the opening 2 tracks on the album you would not beleive how good this show gets. Garcia does not have much going on on Picasso Moon and with Mississippi Half-Step: let's just say there are much more stylish readings on many other shows. But Feel Like a Stranger is great here and the 1st set has a few real highlights. Set 2 is 77+ minutes and is MUST OWN Dead. Lots of high tech that does not exist in previous Dead. You gotta hear it to it. The sound is better than any Dead album I've ever heard.
3,Tired and Listless,"Nice collection of songs, But sloppy playing and flubbed lyrics are a little to much to say this is a must have. It just feels uninspired."
1,Seller sold me used cd when i expected new,This is one of the best GD shows of all time. A must have. 5 stars for the show. 1 star for the seller. I expected a new cd and got a used one.
2,Very weak,"Why does the Dead organization keep releasing [poor], sub-par shows like this one? They have so many great shows on tape, I really don't understand why they release lackluster, sloppy, boring, mistake-laden junk like this."
4,Quite the trip...,"This show is far better than I remember it being at the time. As I type this, it's Halloween '12, and let's just say the mood was right to take this one off the shelf and give it a spin.Try it, you won't be disappointed. Surprisingly, the ""core jam"" is not in the Dark Star, but rather in the UJB>Drums. Jerry is at the height of his tranportative powers, here.It's good stuff."
3,disappointing,"Having read many positive reviews & seeing the song choices & sequences I thought it was a can't miss. The sound quality is indeed five stars but there were lyric flubs (a common flaw) & many of the changeovers in the 2nd set were ragged, especially the closing of ""playing In the band""."
4,Good n hot,"I have not been a fan of kettle style chips in the past, but for these I'll make an exception. 2-3 chips in and you've got a burn going on. I have looked for a truly hot chip for some time, and most fall seriously short. For those not ""appreciative"" of the heat level of these chips, they are overwhelmed with the hot, and say it covers up the taste. Not for me! Actually, I could use them somewhat hotter, but they are not a disappointment. Good heat, great with beer."
5,Repeat!!!,"Bought these wondering how hot they'll be.. The habanero flavor is hands down the hottest potato chip I've eaten. I'm one who lives for the spice so ive grown madly in love with them. Definitely would recommend if you like the spice. For those who thinks products like Tabasco or tapatio or siracha is hot, this product is not for you. Very nice blend of heat as its actually a bit sweet if you get through the bag."
3,"I bought this because, I like spicy foods.","It's really hot (and I'm used to spicy foods) but it doesn't hit you until the 5th chip from that point on it's almost numbing which caused my nose to run. Not much flavor, just plain hot. I recommend Doritos 1-3rd degree burn flavored over these. Also, 14 bags was hard to get through ended up giving half of them away."
3,Ridiculously Hot,"I consider myself able to consume very spicy foods. These chips are excessively spicy and can't be enjoyed after approx 4 chips as your mouth is on fire. What's the point? I wouldn't recommend a 14 pack as it will take a while to finish them. On the upside, they have a great flavor, just toooooo spicy."
2,Not so great,"I first ordered the Chipotle flavor. I didn't enjoy the flavor very much, but the texture was crispy and the amount of flavor was perfect. There was plenty of flavor there but it wasn't overwhelming like some brands are. It was because of this that I decided to give Blair's a second chance. I ordered the Habanero flavor next. I was extremely disappointed. Gone was the perfect amount of flavoring the chipotle chips had. Instead the chips had so much seasoning it was darn near falling off the chips. I've had a few brands of habanero before, but this one tasted nothing like any of them. It has almost a sweet flavor to it. I personally didn't care for it at all. On top of it all, the chips aren't even very hot. I was very disappointed in how hot both chips were considering the brand is called Death Rain. If you can find them, try Poore Brothers Habanero chips. THOSE are some hot chips, with a fantastic flavor."
3,Meh,"I love kettle chips and I love spicy food. This is decently spicy but I don't think the flavor is that great. You definitely taste the vinegar in these, which I don't like. I want the vinegar taste to be mild and subtle but it is a bit strong for me. It's not overwhelming, just not how I like my buffalo flavor."
1,not good,"I like spicy food, most of the snacks labeled as spicy don't cut it, this snack has a good spice level, spicy but still edibleI tend to not like kettle cooked chips, the lays and capecod namebrand I don't like, the only ones I do like are the kettle cooked name brand spicy thaiThat said, these chips are grossThey are thick and stale, the 2 things I hate about kettle cooked chips, the texture is way offThe spice level is perfect, but the taste? bleackhThe taste is what I imagine chewing on moldy cardboard is likeThese chips are nasty grossI wish I could get my money back, they were expensivenot worth it"
5,Great album!!,"I have listened many times to this cd, the music selection is very good, and the recording and playing first rate."
5,Great Bag,"I was very satisfied. High quality fabric with nice features. Bigger than I expected. I was able to use this for a four day trip, including swim wear and gym clothes."
5,Overrated maybe a little,"Not to say that Earthbound is a bad game I don't think it is by any means, however lets think about a few things is the game replayable yes and no. Yes because you could have missed something or maybe for you no because the game was kind of silly in the first place. Dialogue, game play, interesting game play mechanics and strange story is what makes this game! Is this game worth 80-100 bucks with no manual or anything? That depends would you could you ever play an RPG more than once also if you buy the game most big time gamers will give you decent money to buy it from you after you beat it. So honestly it's hard not to play the game or own it when the game is so well recycled and is a pretty fun experience. If you haven't played it consider trying it you can always sell it to one of your gaming buddies after you beat it."
5,What a great Rpg!,What a great Rpg game! A classic. Everyone who has Snes Should get it! I have played it but only on rentals. I want to get it but i dont think i am willing to spend 60$ on a game thats 7 years old. But if you are willing to spend that money then go ahead!
5,This game is sooooo Great!,"I've beaten it and loved it all the way through! Its awesome,you start in a small town and you have to go through it fighting The sharks(the local gang)Stray dogs,crows that drop cookies,Ants and slugs! And all this is done with suff you can go to the local stores and get! No not potions but more like Hamburgers and BaseBall bats!Okay there is an evil alien that takes over the world ten years in the future from the time your in,A metorite hits your town A Bee flies off of it and tells you your the chosen one and you must Go to eight sanctuary spots around the world. Then you chanel your power with the earth then beat Guigas! It's very Fun!"
4,....a awesome classic for RPG lovers!,Of course everyone in Japan refers EB to Mother 2 one of the greatest games there it sold extremely well. That is why Ness is in Smash Bros. and Smash Bros. Melee the reason it sold not poorly but not great here was because of the odd storyline. Sorry just telling details of all of the above now to the game itself. This game has a great plot although it is kind of odd but I would give the plot a 4.75 out of five. The graphics for that time it wasn't that bad ummmm... i would give it a 4. The Sound has some very good music especially the boss battles and towns I'd say a very good 5. It's a little easy to catch on to how to use the controller I'll give it a 4.25.The last and final rating how much fun is it VERY FUN a awesome classic for RPG lovers! The rating for this is 5 stars. And overall a 4.75
5,THE BEST RPG OF ALL TIME!!!!!!,"Well, I must say this probaly is now my favorite game! It's a great RPG and anyone who gets their hands on it will just love it! This is the best classic SNES game ever! So play it! The music,graphics,storyline etc. is great! Did I mention it's SNES? So just play this game! you'll love it and it's hard not to like!"
3,Earthbound Rocks,"Earthbound rocks. When I first played this game, I had finger blisters before I put it down. It has good graphics for a Super Nintendo. The gameplay was simple yet fun. I was only able to rent it from my video store but now I want to own it."
5,Performs as advertised,"We use this power supply to run a VHF radio in our home and it works very well. It keeps us In touch with other islanders, boats and planes"
5,best ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is an amazing system!!!!!!!! I play this all the time! One of the best games for this system is Earthbound! I played this system years ago and now began playing it again and loved it!!!!!!!!! I have many games for snes (super nintendo entertainment system) and i love them all. snes is the best system ever, i have played almost every other one and this is still my favorite!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,SNES,I love SNES! It is one for the books. However mine broke down after 3 years so I wasn't very happy
2,Waiting,I ordered my SNES over two weeks ago and still have not received it. I am beginning to wonder what is going on.
1,Bad service,They sent the product dirty with out the power cord. Is not like I expected.I can not used the console because I dont have that cable.
1,i havent even got it yet,where is it? i ordered it like on christmas and i still dont have it i will change my rating as soon as i get the thing... i hope i get it soon becuase i WILL get my money back!
1,"A Great Console, BUT THE PRICE?.....","The Super Nintendo was the first system I ever got, and I got it when I was really young. It was easy and fun to play for me, and it still is a great console. When N64 came along, I set my SNES aside, but sometimes, when I got bored, I still played it."
2,Disappointed,"I love this system..its from my childhood and is great to have again. However, The system has to be set upset down and in just the right position for it to even turn on....It's a bit disappointing being that it was supposed to be in great condition."
5,Old School Fun!!!,"I've had a Super Nintendo ever since I was 5 years old. I still have it hooked up, and I play it every once in a while. I have a lot of classic games like Super Mario Bros. and Donkey Kong. If you want old school fun, you'll love a SUPER NINTENDO NES SYSTEM!!!"
3,ok,"I was glad to find a Super Nintendo! It works, but it has problems starting games. I almost always have to reset it a few times to get any of my games to play. If it weren't for that problem I would have given 5 stars."
4,Thinking about purchasing a snes?,I recently bought a Super Nitendo to add to my videogame collection. I truthfully say it is not one of the best systems of nitendo but has it's strong points. The system was not mainly about graphics but gameplay. I suggest buying the following games if you are planing on getting this console:Wolfenstien 3dZelda A Link to the PastFinal Fantasy 3Chrono TriggerThe Super NES is a definate if you wish to have a good videogame collection and is one you should not miss. It can be very difficult to find.
4,I like it but the Genesis is better,"Don't get me wrong , Nintendo is a great company. The sound chip is amazing. Its just that the animations are a bit choppy,CPU games are a little sluggish and most of the games are slow. The Sega Genesis games play better and faster. I rate this system 4 out of 5 stars."
3,Slow Shipping..,"I waited two and a half weeks to get my order, And, It barely works, you have to turn it on and off a few times for it to come on, but then it freezes. Faster shipping would have been better.. Horrible."
5,...,"I miss playing my Nitendo! I used to have one when I was little, but my mom gave it away! Along with my Donkey Kong, Super Mario, and Zelda video games. =( Aw, I miss it!!"
3,Dirty but working,"I must confess that I do not actually have the game system because it was a gift for my older sister. However, I asked her to let me know how it was so I could write a review. She told me that you could tell it was used because of a crack and that it was really dirty! But it still works, which is the most important part."
5,Classic Video Gaming,I bought this console because all the games they're making for newer consoles like XBOX and PS3 are just too quick paced and confusing for me. I grew up with an SNES and Gameboy so thought I'd give it a shot again. It was so much fun rediscovering classic games like Super Mario World and Contra. My fiance and I can spend hours a night playing. We love it! And the games are challenging but not impossible and frustrating. It's so much fun!
5,I LOVE it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This whithout a doubt is THE BEST SYSTEM EVER CREATED! Sure mabey he grafics are outdated but, who cares? Not me! Of course a system would be a pointless peice of junk (like Xbox) wthout good games, and in the games catogory the Snes has it all! I onley to think of a few titles like, Super Metroid, Link to the past, Yoshies Island, and MegaMan X to assure myself that the snes rules over a video game systems! If u are tryin to chose between snes and any othe r nintendo system (alhough the rest are great) get the snes! I guarantee youl love it! Buy NOW!!"
5,no doubt,"came earlier then expected and in perfect condition, sweiss is a great guy always trust him <333 i was in doubt at first but whenever you want something go to sweiss ^__^ thanks a lot for the snes :D"
4,gaming fun,"if you like the sega genesis, or liked playing mario on the nes, youll love the snes(or super nintendo) it has video games for every type of gamer, some of my favortites are zelda, adventures of kid kleets, yoshis island and illusions of gaia.the consoles are a fair price, but replacement controllers can go up to $15 so make sure it comes with controllers."
1,machine that does not work right,It does work right.it has lines running through it . is there any way we could get a new or get money back.
5,snes!,"I missed it so much, and it was so worth getting this game and getting to playing all my childhood games again"
4,Best system ever!,"This system represent the golden age of video games. It got the best games like Mortal Kombat to Donkey Kong. Brilliance, sheer brilliance."
4,Power cord gives me a hard time,I love being able to play the games I still had left from my childhood on this system. The power cord gives me some problems but what can you expect from such an old console. Thank you
3,super nintendo,The system was as described. it was in good condition and working well. The games was excited but the problem is that the adapter is not working well because of the vollt difference.Thank you
4,another gem from Chinaski Records,"This is another great Bukowski CD from the Chinaski Records line (the other 2 are ""King of Poets"" and ""70 Minutes In Hell"") Not quite sure what the previous reviewer was expecting from a 30 year old recording made on a tape recorder. Personally, I found it to be quite clear and audible. Bukowski reads some good ones here and his interaction with the German crowd is quite enjoyably. Highly recommended."
3,Slightly Overrated,"This is another episode where I am baffled by its popularity. I personally think it is kind of hard to watch. Also, why did they try to do so much character development in one of the beginning episodes? This should have been attempted late in the first season because they character were still getting used to each other. There was almost no chemistry between the actors in this episode.Also, it was said that the virus spread through perspiration. Then why didn't Kirk and Spock get it when they touched sweaty Sulu?"
5,Humorous,"This episode shows that even Star Trek has room for laughter. Nothing beats Sulu wielding a rapier like D'Artagnan. Truly a collectible, because this is on of the few episodes where Spock's emotions show as he actually cries."
5,I hate Richard Curtis.,I hate him.This author has recklessly produced a work so magnificent that it will leave other writers on this and any other nearby planet feeling depressed with the self-loathing of inadequacy.How could he inflict such perfect dialogue on other innocent scribes?How could he perpetrate such incredible humour?Doesn't he realise that people with weak hearts could literally DIE of laughter?Sod him.
4,Overview with gorgeous photos,"India is a place where you'll miss A LOT if you don't have some understanding of the religious traditions. This lovely book covers the great religions--Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, etc.--with an admittedly broad brush, but it's enough to give you a taste of what you'll see and hopefully whet your appetite for more. Not quite a coffee table book, not really a guide book--but Lonely Planet generally does a good job of conveying culture as well as travel facts. Would also make a nice gift."
5,Tom Principato Band At Its Best,"The situation the previous review mentions has been corrected. The MP3 sound files you hear are now from this CD. This is one of my favorite Principato Band recordings. There are no studio tricks here, just great songs and arrangements played by a tight touring band of world class musicians. If you like it live, the way this music is meant to be heard, this one's for you. This is killer trio R&B."
5,Mind-Blowing!,"I saw this when it aired on television and am excited to see that it is now available on DVD. Like a lot of people, I suppose, I struggled at times with my faith; particularly as a student in college who gets hit all the time by my ""well-educated"" professors with all the reasons smart, scientifically informed people, like Laplace famously said, ""don't need the (God) hypothesis."" This program does a great job of showing how truly smart, unbiased scientists who study the cosmos are relying upon the ""God hypothesis"" more and more."
2,Good but could have been so much better,"The fact that I only paid about $4 for this is the only reason I'm not disappointed. This is very short, and does present a few good points by some qualified scientists. But when it ends, it feels abrupt, and you are left thinking, ""That was it?"" I would have appreciated a little more depth and detail, as well as more scientists in different fields. I'm not sure I'd recommend it even for the attention span challenged. As noted in another review, the host gets on your nerves and makes you want to fast forward to the real content. These two DVD's (The Privileged Planet / Unlocking the Mystery of Life 2-DVD Set) are much better. I would recommend those instead."
1,Disappointing,"This is based on the ""Intelligent Design Theory"", so for Christians looking to deepen their understanding of the role science plays in their faith...you are left very disappointed. The tile is ironic, because they do not refer to God, rather calling Him an ""Intelligent force/designer""."
2,A Dud,A real Dud... the commentator gets on your nerve real fast... and only has about two minutes of real content. A missed opportunity to do a meaningful program.... don't approach getting your money worth on this effort.
5,I agree.,"I agree with Cjay Swanson's five star review; found ""Beyond the Foothills"" in a thrift shop in Nashville; somebody was crazy to give it up."
4,Better Than Competing Product,"I tried this oil for the first time and it was delicious! Next I tried a competing brand called ""Argan Culinary Oil"" by ""Elbertai"" (the label says: ""Pure Argan Oil"") which appears to be MORE expensive (but is less with shipping) -- this Mustapha's brand is a MUCH better deal (but a bit more expensive). It is more tasty and has a great nutty flavor and amazing aroma. The price appears to be LOWER than the other brand (but not if you add shipping) but the quality is higher and the packaging is better. Buy this brand over the other since they are within $5 of each other in resulting price."
5,"So old, but still very actual",That's one of my most favorite books ever! It expands your meteorology knowledge and helps you to get closer to the instrument flying principles. Personally for me it was also very interesting to get familiar with all these vintage instruments and navigation methods.
4,The Original,"this is the original one, and not the Follow up [ field of screams ] this one is FAR better than the sequal"
2,Ignores the nuts and bolts of wired home networks,"Maybe wireless is the wave of the future but I was looking for information on pulling wires in walls; finishing wires and connectors in sheetrock; I'm back on Amazon looking for a book that will help me wire up our house as its being built. However, the book seems to do a good job addressing the operating system set-up side for a network although its tiresome to have to wade through Windows 98 and Windows Me references."
2,Only covers hardware configuration,"This book does not cover managing a home network after it's set up. It only walks you through hooking up and configuring your hardware. It contains nothing on workgroups, file sharing, etc. I found the ""Missing Manual"" book on home networking to be much more thorough in this regard."
2,Old technology,Good advice for the early 90's.Technology has changed. So get a more up-to-date book.
3,American Blues Debut,"!967-68 was a good year for blues rock groups:The Rolling Stones released BEGGAR'S BANQUET;Cream was conquering both the US and UK;Canned Heat steamed up the place;and,in San Francisco,the Gollywogs had changed their name to Creedence Clearwater Revival and recorded an album.What an album for blues lovers.John Fogerty has a voice that rises from the mud of Lousiana 'gator country ,yet he is Californian born and raised.From this release on it was clear that Tom Fogerty had been replaced as the group leader and singer/songwriter .This album is not quite the Creedence we grew to know and love,but it haS enough brilliant tracks (SUZIE Q PT1,PORTERVILLE,I PUT A SPELL ON YOU)to place CCR on the road to rock immortality."
3,CCR Plus,"I enjoyed the original album as well as this remaster which adding a few songs is cool but with the space on a CD much more could have been easily added. I really expected the CD to padded out with much more but was dissappointed in the final product. I mean The Pretenders re-issued their first CD with a second CD! This one comes out with just one with a few added tracks, geeze record company personal, whats next, a bailout of the record industry because your not making the money you should have on these re-releases. I give it a three because half of the experience of a remaster is the added material to the original.Visit my site ""Judemac Forever"" google it sometime and drop by for a while."
4,Includes a couple of classics,"CCR's first has two standout songs, two very good songs and a couple of good-but not great songs. Susie Q is one of my all-time favorites. It is a moody, almost stalkerish, love song. Lyrically it's quite simple: ""Oh Susie Q, baby I love you, Susie Q"" for example. But its the music that drives it to be memorable. A brooding, grungy drum beat layered behind Fogerty's great guitar work. ""I put a Spell on You"" is an excellent remake of an old classic with Fogerty's gruff voice adding urgency to the lyrics. ""The Workingman"" and ""Ninety nine and a half"" are good bluesy rock songs. The rest are decent, but not as memorable. Overall, a very good rock n' roll CD."
5,Made my day! Love Creedence,I grew up enjoying Creedence Clearwater~this brought back many good memories*that's what life is all about. I enjoyed it once again after the years have gone by.*I have several of their CD's.Amazon gives great service as well.
5,Every car in Indiana should have this book,"A fun & light-hearted book with just the right amount of info to make you want to take that side trip and search out the highest spot in Indiana, the best ice cream store or an animal preserve. Dick has a great way with words. Every car in Indiana should have this book!!"
5,"Wolfsie's lighthearted, witty style is perfect for this topic","Indianapolis TV personality Dick Wolfsie is well-known in Central Indiana for finding fun, interesting human-interest segments for his station's morning show. Wolfsie continues this theme by digging up oddities from all over the Hoosier state that would interest any traveler who wants to stray from the beaten path. Wolfsie provides a description of the curiousity, organized by region and alphabetized by the town in which it is located. The book covers five regions and includes a map of that region that labels every town mentioned in that section of the book, no matter how small the town.Examples include the RV museum in Elkhart, a jar museum in Muncie and the site of John Dillinger's first official crime in Mooresville.Wolfsie includes addresses, phone mumbers, websites, e-mail addresses and contact names (some are only available through appointments). Rough directions from Indianapolis are included."
3,A retract in search of a section,"There is a wonderful course in category theory for high school students, just begging to be excavated from this multi-layered book.Please don't be put off by the disjointed and uneasy combination of materials that cluster around certain themes. You know you will have a lot of work to do when the same definition (of monomorphism) is presented both on page 52 and also on page 336.With all the elementary themes covered in many varying ways, it would be best to consider this book as having been structured as a retract for which your job will be to construct the appropriate section."
1,Superficial and errorneous,"I thought this should be a good book. I read it through within 45 minutes and got really annoyed. It glossed over too much stuff, even for a management-type book. Some of the terminologies were incorrect. He even said that Gordon Moore is called ""George"" Moore. You can learn more by grabbing any magazine and start reading an article on these things (Web Services, Nanotech, Security, Grid Computing, Linux, Wireless Tech, XML, CRM, J2EE, .Net)."
2,Mixed formats spoil the package,"I almost ordered this double feature, but I saw a copy in a store, and... contrary to the product information here, ""Showdown in Little Tokyo"" is full screen (while ""Bloodsport"" is wide-screen). Why do distributors mix movie formats like this? I admit, however, this double feature is still a good deal, since I have only seen ""Shakedown"" available in full screen (even though it's theatrical release was wide-screen). Still, I'll hold out. If you like this disc, you might want to check outMartial Arts Collection: 4 Film Favorites (Rumble in the Bronx / The Corruptor / Showdown in Little Tokyo / Bloodsport)before making your final decision."
5,Wow,"You can't go wrong with this DVD you have Jean Claude Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren, and Brandon Lee. You have two great martial art movies here..."
4,double pleasure,"both movies have plenty of action,Bloodsport is a true story followingFrank Duxs to hong kong to fight in the martials arts"
3,The sizing of these boots is unbelievable,"I ordered a M size 13, but the boot sole looked like a 16. The boots were MASSIVE. Strangely, the ankles seemed appropriately snug. Bottom of the sole was stamped with a 13, so I know the size was correct. If you order these, you will most likely have to ship them back as they will not fit. Aside from sizing problems, the boots were exactly what I wanted. Nothing fancy, just simple, functional, waterproof rubber boots. I removed two stars for the unreal sizing of a 13 being at least 2 sizes off, if not 3."
1,"One star, because it doesn't get any lower","I bought this kicking net for my 17 year old son. He used it three times before the side bent and the net ripped. It frequently fell apart when he was using it, and then he would have to stop and put the legs back on. Now it is completely broken. I would not recommend this product for anyone out of elementary school because it just doesn't hold up or stay in place."
4,unexpected sound spectacular,"Being a Sneaker Pimps fan... (era Kelli Ali), I did expect her solo effort to be a little darker than Tigermouth. After the first listen I was a little put off, but after giving the new sound a chance, I realized that this is a really good cosmic POP record. The lyrics are very sunny and smooth, and at times at times schoolgirl-ish. The sound is lighter, and more layered than the sneaker pimps sound. Bottom line, If you lower your expectations, and pretend that the Sneaker Pimps never existed, this can be a fun summertime driving record. 4 stars is generous, but the album cover gets a star on its own!"
3,Easy cheap chaise,"It arrived so fast i didn't remember i ordered it.It arrives in several pieces (4 legs, a back and side panel- along with the base.)the instructions only clarify what you are looking at.building it myself i wish i had a helper but i did it.It is firm and the storage cubby is great. once together it feel sturdy and as good as any thing else in the house.it seems to be better together than in pieces as the quality control is not CNC or computer perfect- but we got it for 300.00 US dollars so we didn't expect Room and Board or Sundance furniture.it fits great is the right size for our room and house.nice buy it seems like it has always been there.I am Five foot seven. it is just right for me, i read and pass out on the thing all the time.it is not an extravagant and large piece, it is smaller is proportions than lots of stuff (Z-gallerie or Louis XIV for example.)"
5,Easy assemble. Good looking and nice and firm.,Came well packed for a big item. Easy assemble. Good looking and firm.The drawings for the assembly could have been much clearer. when assembling the back support i was about to make a whole in the fabric but my friend found out the velcro in the fabric.
5,A Great CD,"While I have enjoyed Jim's music, I must admit I have never owned any of his CD's until this one. I am a huge fan of Rebecca Lynn Howard and when she recorded his title track, I bought the CD. I enjoy listening to the entire CD everyday and have recommended it to several friends. Adding vocals to some of the tracks on his CD, brings new fans to Jim's music. Those that are only interested in his piano playing are truly missing out on Jim's total talent along with the talent of those that participated in making this a great CD."
5,Inspiring!,"If you love relaxing with piano music, this is the musician for you!! It is not neccesarily for sleeping, but great for background or slipping into your own thoughts...you will love this album...my favorites are 11) Serenade, 4) Night Rain 1) The Promise 7) Waiting for You 8)Journey....all of his music is good, but some really stand out....not a huge fan of the ones with vocals I must say...just doesn't seem to fit his style and after listening to several tunes that is just music, then you don't expect vocal tune, makes it a bit weird....I do love the vocal one ""The Simple Things"" though...anyway, he is a master at his talent and we get to enjoy his music!!"
5,Wonderfully melodic,This is a wonderfully melodic album and makes a great masterpiece for a romantic evening. A definite must-have for all Brickman fans!
3,A Brickman in Transition,"Brickman continues to make his transition from the solo romantic piano genius that made him famous. Simple Things makes things more complicated. If you like Brickman for his first two albums and the pure solo piano, you likely won't like this one."
3,"Good, but the same ol' Jim","Don't get me wrong, I like Jim Brickman. But I'm just waiting for him to get out of the same 3 keys and play something that shows more skillful playing. Maybe I'm just a little tired of the ""simple"" sound. I've recently come across a new artist by the name of Josh Kramer, and I really like his sound. It combines the simplicity of Jim Brickman's style with a little more depth and complexity. There are no vocals however, so if you like those, don't buy it. But if you like good instrumental music, consider this album. It is called ""Stepping Out"" and I actually found it here on Amazon."
3,Useless book,"This book just contains an old list of historical novels and a brief summary of their story. So, tell me again why I bought this."
2,Poor sound quality,I had the opportunity to listen to pieces of this CD before buying it used at a reduced price. The sound quality was so bad that I declined. This is basically a very poor quality bootleg.There are many live Gentle Giant CD's available and almost all of them have poor sound quality. I don't know why. We bought some bootleg Gentle Giant LP's in the seventies that had very good sound. Can't they find the sources of those recordings?
5,CLASSY N' VERY DIVA,"This scarf is just beautiful. The style is classy, and it is extremely soft to the touch. The colors are natural and conservative, but at the same time this scarf is very stylish and it says, ""hello, look at me, I am stylin' a gorgeous Georgio Armani Wool Scarf!""I bought this for one of my best friend's for her birthday and she just loves it. She wears it proudly with practically every piece of clothing she owns.The other great thing is that this scarf is not expensive for the quality it provides. This is a great gift for a great price. I highly recommend giving this to a close friend for xmas!Thanks,Toni"
4,Great value!,I have always loved Cats Don't Dance. It is comic gold and the music is superb when compared to most Disney or Bluth films. Great plot and fun for adults and children alike. Quest for Camelot is... well it's a movie. It has an all star cast which as usual sets up for a rather mediocre plot. I would not purchase it by itself but it turns out my daughter loves it so this set was an excellent buy for me.
5,Best Christmas Gift,"The songs are great, and i always wanted to own a copy of this animated movie but could never find it in stores.Its got a good theme behind this story. So its a great movie to watch with kids and family."
3,Very songful,"The main reason I purchased this item was that there are several songs by Steve Perry. I was disappointed, however, not to get the music video of him singing ""I Stand Alone"" which is clearly listed on the packaging. I have learned since then it is supposed to be on the ""Special Edition."" I feel kind of cheated that I did not get this.I have not yet watched ""Cats Don't Dance."" I would recommend ""Quest for Camelot"" for ages 10 and up."
4,Didn't get the ending.....,"This book geniunely spooked me, and I thought it was a great escape read with lots of twists and turns. However, I had built myself up for a great ending, and when it did end, I was confused. Who did she end up with? Was Greg an evil something? I just did not comprehend what happened, even though I've gone back and re-read the ending. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the rest of it, even if I felt like a ninny for not understanding the ending!"
3,Midnight is a Lonely Place,"Kate Kennedy has broken up with her boyfriend and is left without a place to stay. She is in the middle of writing a book and decides to rent an isolated country cottage. Once there she is plagued by mysterious and supernatural events. Out of all of Erskine's books that I have read, I probably enjoyed this one the least. What I've enjoyed in the past was her characters in the present day and their connection or experience with historical characters. Although some of that was present here, it read more like a ghost story than an historical novel."
3,didn't really 'grab' me,"This is the 4th novel of Barbara Erskine's that I have read. And this is the one that I like the least. Unlike House of Echoes, this did not scare me, and unlike Lady of Hay and Child of the Phoenix, this book did not transport me to another time and place.I can't place my finger on what it was, but the story just seemed a little flat. Maybe there were too many characters and they were fairly bland and cliched. I didn't understand which of the two male leads I was meant to like, and decided on Greg who was fleshed out better than Jon.It was still an interesting story and it won't disuade me from reading more from this author."
1,merely a pamphlet,"This book was a major disappointment after just having read two dozen books on the Manhattan Project, beginning with ""109 E. Palace"", ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" by Richard Rhodes and including ""American Prometheus"" ""Day of Trinity"" ""Oppenheimer Shatterer of Worlds"" and ""The Manhattan Project"" by Kelly."
3,"Collectible, but too long.","I understand why David Lynch took his name off. The pace is just too slow. As a fan of Dune, I appreciate the extra content from the book that was missing from the theatrical release. I appreciate this version as a collector, but I feel the 2001 version of Dune was a better movie."
3,Duna - Import,"This film is an attempt to put The Book -- Dune to film. I felt that it falls short of the production made by the Science Fiction Channel. It was also fairly expensive for what you get. I enjoyed viewing it, but it's not the kind of film you would watch more than once a year."
5,CHISTES EXCEPCIONALES,NO te imaginas lo que te vas a repir con estos chistesísimos !Son los mejores que he leído !
2,"At best, FAIR","A large majority of the information presented in this book can easily be found by using popular search engines on the Internet. It seems that the author simply rehashed documentation he created in the course of his job and made a book out of it. There is no clear direction or any attempt at explaining his methods and/or techniques.While he has an impressive area of letters following his name (CCNA, CNE, etc), none of them have anything to do with a security related certification. Where is the GSEC, GCFW, GCIA or the default standard for security professionals, CISSP??? Granted, industry certifcations usually don't mean a thing unless they can be backed up with experience but if you are going to use certifications in an attempt to sell a book, at least choose some that have something to do with information security!!"
5,Pet Safe doors are the best of them all!,"This was my third Pet Safe dog door. I previously had two of the sliding glass door inserts, and they were perfect. Once I moved to a different home, we got this one for our standard mud room door, and it was superb as well. ""Was superb?"", you ask? We got a German Shepherd, and she wasn't going to be fitting in a medium door. We made a poor choice going with a different brand when we had to up size the door. It's cheap and crappy, and in hindsight, we should have gone with Pet Safe. Our cheap replacement won't be lasting forever, and we'll have the sense to replace it with a Pet Safe one!"
3,Good - but needs some serious copyediting,"I thought the book was good, although a bit uneven. What really caught me by surprise, though, was the very obvious misspellings and grammatical errors.""Carmen Diaz"" for Cameron Diaz, ""Marshal"" law, and ""Berkalounger"" were only a few. It really detracted from the book because they pulled me away from the story. Some of the plotlines seemed as though they were dropped, and the ending seemed a bit rushed, but perhaps that's because there's a sequel?In any case, it was a good read, and I would definitely check out the sequel."
4,Have you ever made love on a Harley?,'Good Girls Do' by Cathie Linz is a fun romance novel. This novel is based around a small town somewhat like the 'Gilmore Girls' TV show. Julia works at the local library and Luke is the local bad seed that returns to town to run his father bar. The supporting characters are scary real. Forget the bad reviews - if you are looking for light enjoyable romance - I would read this one!
5,Great Movie,"I have been waiting for years for this movie to come out on DVD. I ordered this movie on VHS years ago, but now I don't own a VHS player. I love this movie. It is my favorite Dorcas Brower movie. I was excited to watch this movie since my Mom is featured in it. Now I can share this movie with my children."
3,Ice Palace,"I liked this film because it goes through family generations and conflicts. Despite the fact the main characters fall out - the offsprings have other ideas and we can learn from this - if someone in your family ""falls out with another"" and you are not involved then carry on as normal I liked this film when I saw it many years ago and wish it were available in the UK or that some of the TV stations here would play it as it is a really good film."
2,The best parts were left on the cutting room floor,"I lived in Fairbanks when this was filmed. The population turned out to recreate the statehood parade down 2nd Ave, and the recreation parade was better than the original. But this was apparently cut out of the movie, and only about 30 seconds shows the real Fairbanks. They might as well have saved the cost of filming on location and used a sound stage."
5,Surprise for my Wife,"I bought this as a gift for my wife, it's one of her favorites and she didn't think it was possible to buy it anywhere. She was very happy and very surprised."
4,Good story........:0),"Compared to today's movies, may be a little corny..........but still has a lot to say...........Worth the price to me, for sentimental reasons.........."
5,Ice Palace (vhs).,"Wonderful movie, I have viewed this movie many times. Found this movie with no problem, on Amazon. This movie came in excellent condition."
3,Shuttle Attache - too small,"The product seems to be sturdy and light, but there is no place to carry the charging cord and transformer, which is pretty much essential for a laptop."
3,Were's THE LP MIX??????,"THIS CD Version of Celi Bee's FLY ME ON THE WINGS OF LOVE is the 7:50 Version,NOT THE LP Mix(13:11.....Fly Me On The Wings Of Love(Act 1,2 & 3)....Plus THE 7:50 Min Version is not even the REMIX Vinyl I Have,I Thought THIS WAS THE LP Version WHICH I WAS LOOKING FOR,ANY WAY if your Looking for the LP Mix...this Ain't IT....I'm still NOW Seaching FOR THE LP Mix......I Notice That Most of the Tracks Listed here on AMAZON has NO Time After Tracks Which Sucks,Cause U don't Know if Your Getting Single Mix or Long Version!!!!It's A crapshoot!!!!!...Here Are The Times OF The TRACKS ON This CD!!FLY ME ON THE WINGS-7:50BOOMERANG-4:23CAN'T LET U GO-5:33YOU'RE THE BEST THING-4:39"
1,Original LP Release Purchased 4/1979,"The original Celi Bee "" Fly me on the Wings of Love"" did include three Acts. I have the LP in front of me..The totaltime was 12.56 minutes. It included Fly me on the Wings of Love,Act I Higher,Higher, Act II Love, What You've Done To Me,Act III Midnight Passion then Epilog...It would be nice to replace with a CD version duplicate.."
5,DISCO ROCKS!,"Maybe not so well known or remembered but playing againon Sirius, my brother ONLY has the BEST ORIGINALS and thisis proudly a part of his DISCO collection!!"
4,Fly Me...,"With the variety of songs on this disk, I must state that it's the fastest 39 minutes I've ever listened to. It's disco, dance, pop and a tiny bit of R&B Dance. I paid $19.99 through Amazon and had to wait two months to get it. But, it's a pleasant surprise (and really easy on the ears). I really like the disc. Four stars!"
5,Smart salespeople sometimes wear plaid,"I ran across this book by accident but the content as well as Barry's insights motivated me to purchase 10 more copies for my salespeople. Barry shares a rare blend of facts, insights and motivation- as well as pertinent quotes from classics to underscore his subjects. I want his future book on sales management!"
5,another great release,"First off the Andy Sneap production is on the cd is outstanding. The songs aren't as angry as the ones from ""Hit for Six"", but still very good. This is a must have for fans of ""Strung Out"". I highly recommend this cd. Consumed are one of the best bands out there right now!"
2,Leather Good...Personalization Bad.,"The leather product is decent with a slight overprice; however, the personalization is worthless. I was expecing my initials embroidered, but instead got my name stamped on a metal strip, then glued to the leather valet. It looks pretty cheap, so would not recommend paying all the extra cash for personilzation."
2,This book is a scheme for getting your money.,"A poorly organized collection of author's publications and maybe somebody's Ph.D. thesis introduction.Even on subjects that I am familiar with, I had problem to trace the thoughts. It seems that book is a few days copy-paste enterprise.This highly overpriced book cannot be used as an introduction. Neither can it serve as a review of the topic becauseonly author's and, sometimes, his near colleague's results are included. The latter are often not central and usually represent onlyspecial achievements among a number of remarkable results that are completely missing from this book.Book arrives in a plastic cover, which opening prevents the owner from returning it. I would give 3 stars for the topic onlyif it were not for the price that I payed."
1,NOT WORTH YOUR TIME!,"I purchased these skates thinking they would be ok. I wore them ONCE.....ONE TIME.....at the skating rink. Within the first hour, the bearings in one of my wheels fell apart. The skating rink employee that fixes skates said that the bearings used in these skates are the lowest quality available. He was nice enough to replace the defective bearing at no charge. Also while skating, the bottom of my boot continually hit the front outside wheel in my turns causing me to stumble and/or fall no matter which direction I was skating (Clockwise/counterclockwise). If I were you....DO NOT PURCHASE THESE! Spend a little more money and get a better pair. I definitely got what I paid for.....CRAP!"
5,Amazing Skates !,"I Love The Chicago Bullet Speed Skates ! They're Really Worth The Price . I've Had These Skates For 7 Months Now &' It's Time To Get New Skates . The Toe Stoppers Are Pretty Much Gone But You Can Easily Buy New Toe Stoppers . &' In The Front Right About The Toe Stoppers , Both Skates Are Starting To Get A Hole . They Have Really Good Padding &' Are Very Comfortable . The Wheels Are Amazing . I'd Defiantly Recommend These Skates For Beginners . I'm Intermediate"
1,Fail,"They sent PINK ones instead of black, and they were in womens size. I started skating and fell and sprained my wrist."
2,Not The Best Skates,"I bought these skates for my son as a gift. First problem is that they run very small. He wears a men's size 10, and these 10's are equal to a men's size 8 & 1/2. Secondly they are advertised as speed skates, and even though my son only tried them on our hard wood floor in the hallway and kitchen, he said they were very slow."
4,I havent gotten them yet,I haven't gotten them yet but the reviews are worrying me!!! ahhhh!! Are they really bad?? will they work on a 140 pound women??
2,Disappointed,Not very happy with this. My 12 year old son wanted to try the new skates out the next day after we received them. Went to the roller rink to find out that one of the wheels was totally different than the other 7. The are all grooved and the one is smooth even slick in texture which my son says it makes a difference. Also the velcro strap came apart and I had to sew it back together.
4,Very nice for young kids,I purchased the skates for my 6 year old nephew as a birthday gift.When the skates arrived I really excited about the design of the skates.Fits him perfectly the skates are the perfect height for him as well.Good buy my sister saw them and will be purchasing a pair for my other nephew.
1,terrible product,"Please, Please do not purchase this product it is awful. I purchased this for my daughter's birthday and gave her a skate party and would you believe the things broke 30 minutes after putting theme on for the first time. My daughter fell and was injured because the wheels completely broke off."
1,Poor Quality,"I would not recommend this product to anyone. First of all they're described as ""unisex"", but when I received them, they were in a mens size. The second and most important reason I would not recommend these skates is the poor quality. I ordered these for my daughter and two friends as Christmas gifts. It is now only two weeks into January, and two of the three pairs ordered are already broken. Some of my daughter's other friends received the same brand of skates for Christmas as well, and most have broken as well. Save your money!"
3,Good as a base product for price,"I am very heavy into skating and have very expensive skates but I needed something for my daughter as she grows. If you spend $100 on good wheels, bearings, and suregrip double action cushions you can move these items from bullet skate to bullet skate as you child grows out of their shoe size. After you have good wheels, bearings and cushions all you have to spend is $40 on these bullet skates when your child grows into the next size(get rid of the wheels and bearings that they come with the skates because they are junk)and they react and roll like a more expensive skate."
4,Good Skates,"So far I've used these skates once and they worked well. I don't know much about roller skates so I can't say if these are high quality or not, but I do know that they're good for beginners. And they're a good price! I like my pair, and even if they bust on me someday, I'm still happy I bought them."
2,you get what you pay for,"I bought these to use in a a community theater production that required very little use of the skates. I didn't expect much out of these since they were cheap. And I guess that is the real finding. These are cheap. They worked for a few weeks of light use before they broke. The fit was ok, the performance was ok, and I could have probably fixed them but didn't want to chance them breaking again in a show. I ended up buying a more expensive pair to replace them. If you want to go cheap these my work for a while, if you want something of quality you just can't get it at this price."
4,Roller Skates,These skates were for 2 of my grandaughters and they love the look and the speed of them.I order 2 pair for Christmas and they both arrived on time.The only problem was the size 4 which I had ordered was too small and the return for a size 5 was real easy and fast. They are enjoying those skates..Thanks
2,Chicago Bullet Men's speed skate,"When we received these the nuts and screws were not on the one skate!!?!? We had to go to Lowe's and purchase them, then take it to the skate rink to make sure they were safe for our son's use. Very disappointing!"
4,Great beginner skate,"Bought this skate this past year for my son who is 7. The skate fit true to size, and is very comfortable. Great for beginner! We are getting ready to purchase our second pair for him for Christmas this year. Wouldn't go with any other brand."
4,Great for the price!,I've been using my new skates a lot lately and I must say I am satisfied with the feel and quality of this product. The original wheels are good for grip on indoor surfaces and the bearings + (softer) wheel combo don't roll for super long distances but that's to be expected. Slightly loosening the wheels allow for longer roll and slightly loosening the trucks (both with the tool included) allow for better mobility. The boot fits secure and is true to size.
1,How can anyone wear these???,"I purchased the size 3 mens. The length and width of the shoe part of the skate appears to be correct for this size. The problem is the height of the inside ""toe area"" is inadequate. The front 2"" of the shoe part has only 1/4"" to 3/8"" verticle clearence for the toes. In comparison the average shoe of the same size has about 3/4"" of clearence for the toes. Impossible to wear!"
5,Great,This product was exactly what I needed to be able to hook up our Nintendo 64. Yes old game console...but younger kids still love to play with it.
5,Wow,"Good price. Good qulaity. Don't be fooled into spending more money on another product. Works for: SNES, n64, Gamecube."
3,Disappointed.,"I specifically ordered this item from this seller because the listing title gave the impression it was a ""Nintendo"" brand original cable, It was not. Does the cable work? Yes. Is this cable poor quality? No, but it's not as good as the original. Then what are you complaining about? The principle. If I wanted an off brand av cable, I could have bought one from Ebay for a dollar. The listing should be properly titled. I want what I ordered, and at the three dollars I paid for this it's not even worth my time returning."
1,Cheap,"I purchased this because our old AV Cables broke after years of use. 2 days after I got these, they broke. My 2 year old was simply shaking them when they were connected to the TV. The metal pieces broke off inside of my TV and I can't get them out. I would definitely NOT buy these. Now even if I wanted to get new ones, it wouldn't be any use. Very upset."
1,Not A Nintendo Product,"This cord is not made by Nintendo. It is a flimsy, unbranded knockoff. The advertising is very misleading. Avoid this product."
3,It works...,"I have been using this cable to play my old Nintendo 64 games for about 4 months now. It works just fine, although I have noticed that the wires are a bit loose and the cable itself could be longer. But it's a good product overall, and sold at a reasonable price."
5,Just what i needed!!!,This was just what i needed and it came two weeks sooner that it said it would. I am very pleased with the cable and it worked really well with my nintendo 64.
4,Nintendo AV Cable,The cable works great. It was very inexpensive (even with shipping) and came quickly! My son was happy to be able to play his old nintendo game console again!
3,S-Video produces a far better image,"This is same type of AV cable that came bundled with the SNES, N64, and Nintendo Gamecube. The build quality is of course the best you'll probably find if it's an official Nintendo product, however I would highly recommend buying the S-Video version of this cable. Even if you can only find 3rd party cables, you won't regret purchasing one, as the video signal will drastically increase compared to composite. Two leads on the S-Video cable carry analog color and contrast information to your display, while composite video does this on one lead. The result is a much sharper image (just look on youtube for comparisons. S-Video has very little pixel bleeding, while composite video blends the colors together, producing a very poor image)."
3,okay,"its a cheap knock off of the nintendo brand but it does what you want it too, picture is Not what it is scam."
4,Does what I need it to do,Seems a little cheap and flimsy but works just fine and does what I need it to do. I would recommend this item so far.
1,Doesn't work.,"I got the cable sooner than i was expecting, but when i try it in my nintendo it didn't work. The audio works but i couldn't see the image."
4,Equiment,Thank's for the information on this product great detail's. And look forward to doing future business in the future. Thank's
1,Item does not work. cable is very cheap and thin,This item did not work with my SuperNES. I wanted a backup cable for my system but this item did not render any video picture at all and the audio was very poor with lots of static.
5,Mario Kart Tournaments to Resume,These cables have allowed me to play some of my favorite N64 games again. They shipped quickly and work really well.
2,It didnt work,the cable rattled when i first recieved it and didnt work so i cant really give a good review m
1,cheap quality product,these av cables are really cheap. i used them on my super nintendo playing dkc and they worked for about 30 seconds before the screen went black half way through a level. i reset the console and tried hooking the cables into another port on my TV and nothing worked.now ive had problems with my snes before so i tried these cables on my n64. all i got was a blank screen. these cables are definitely not worth the money or time.
5,received in perfect condition! couldn't be happier with service!!,product came within a week to two weeks. service was quick and easy. will definitely use this seller in the future!!!
4,SATA Data/Power Combo Cable,"This is the second one I've purchased. Both work fine. The combo style of cable is the only one that is mechanically stable enough for my taste. Most SATA data cables jiggle, but when combined with the power cable they're very stable. Those with retainer clips are also good but, at least for my application, not as good as the combo."
4,All About Sam by Lois Lowery,"Have you ever wondered what your little brother or sister was thinking? Well, if you have, then All About Sam is a good book for you.The book is about a family told from a baby's point of view. The baby's name is Sam. He has one big sister named Anastasia. His father's name is Myron and his mom's name is Katherine.This book is very humorous. Sam is curious about everything. He takes a smoking pipe and lighter off his dad's desk and brings it to school for Show and Tell. He also goes into his mom and dad's bathroom and gives himself a punk haircut. He goes to his older sister's room and takes her pet fish Frank and flushes him down the toilet. He expects it to rain pet fish because his mom once told him that whatever is flushed down the toilet will come down as rain a couple of days later.I understand this book because I have two younger sisters and a younger brother . If you like to laugh, you'll enjoy what this funny baby does, and I suggest you read All About Sam."
3,All about Sam,"This book is a good book that I will read again. Sam is nice and he has a sister that is crazy, she does this thing with a code that I think is weird and so did Sam in the book. You should be sure to read this book!Maggie H. 4th grader"
5,This book rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This book is really good! I feel like reading the book again! In this my favorite part is how he gets older and much smarter!By John M. Holland P.A.
4,Sam rocks!,Do you like funny books? If so all about sam is the perfect book for you! Sam is a very curious boy that takes everything sirious. Like when he asked his sister how to get big muscules. She told him to pump iron. Sam took his mom's pumps or shoes and ironed them! Read all about Sam! Kyle age 9 Holland PA
4,All about sam is great!!!!!!!,I like this book because Sam is funny and I also like the part when Sam gets a new friend named Adam. And I like when Sam gets a pet worm. He named it King of Worms. That's what I like about All about Sam.Colin L. age 9
5,all about sam,All about Sam reviewI think all about Sam is a great book it is fabulous. I love it!! My favorite part was when he had show and tell and he brought his dads cigar. It was really funny. I think children 9 and up would find it good.(...)
1,mater clock,horrible product...impossible to set time...a huge waste of money and time...disney should be taken to task for putting their name on this piece of junk
3,"Great clock, if it would STOP TALKING!!","Okay, it's a great looking clock and it's funny!'Wake up sleeping beauty'!, in Mater's voice. HA.Unfortunately, though it is set for 9AM, it goes off every HOUR."
5,pioneer,"this game was the very first ever of its type. think of it like an on-line rpg, with 20 people(each controling a group) all under your command. By broadening the focus of the game so that individual battles are mostly pretty minor, you get to focus more on character developement and strategy. great game"
2,It works but....,The game is functional but the case looks nothing like the picture. It is very dirty and miscoloured. The label is worn and torn in many places. I thought I was purchasing a better looking game. Be careful when purchasing from this seller - the picture is not what you will receive!
3,Bait And Switch,I was offered free shipping but could not buy enough of the item i wanted to get that.tryed to rebuy buy couldn'tfeel like I was given a deal and then it was taken awayreal upset that i could not buy as many as i needed!!!BAIT AND SWITCHAS IN INCREASE THE PRICE BEYOND WHAT I BOUGHT THE FIRST ONES FORSORRY!!!
5,BEST RPG EVER!!!!!,"This is defenatly the best Rpg ever made, even beter than the Final Fantasy Series. Altough it lacks in Graphics compared to wahat we got today it has a very rich and thick Storyline. I played and beat this game 58 times in one year and it never gets boring. This game has nice Music but not as quality like as the newer Square Games. SOOOOOOOO!!!!BUY THIS GAME!!!BUY THIS GAME!!!If you dont like this game you are out of your mind!!!!"
5,Best rpg ever made!,"I played this on an emulator and snes and it's awesome! It's the best rpg ever made and it's on the super nintendo. Good storyline, music, characters, and everything else. Get it!"
5,Simply the best,"Can't really say much more than that. The combat, the movement, the plot, the magic system, the items, the maps, the vehicles, the NPCs, everything just fits together perfectly and the final boss fight manages to be exciting and challenging without being impossible. Still the best game ever."
5,MASTERPIECE!,"words can't really express, MASTERPIECE is only thing I can say! Box is great, game is breath taking, and manual is beautiful. I was a tiny bit disappointed that there was no poster but oh well, overall its great!"
5,one of the best games ever!,"this game has it all, and i mean everything! great graphics, gameplay, storyline, battle system, maps and 11 endings! this game is a must buy so, if you don't have a super nentendo than get one, or get a PS2/PS and buy final fantasy cronicals."
5,"In a pinch, can be used for other similiar grills.","My grill isn't a Webber, but I was still able to get it installed by cutting the top of the metal covering the electrode to make room for the burners.Lights the grill everytime."
5,Works as Stated,Weber product replacement was easy to install and is a bit better than the original.
5,as easy as a push of a button,"Easy to install, works perfect. Took 10 minutes. Definitely better than the ""universal"" ones"
2,Weber Ignitor,"The first things to go bad in my Weber Genesis were the flavorizer bars. It was a little over two years. The porcelain burned off, and they rusted through. I replaced the bars with stainless steel bars so they would not rust out again.Now the steel box on the ignigtor is rusted out, and the grill won't light. The cheap tin electrode enclosure rusted so bad that half of the enclosure was gone (vaporized ?!).Now my grilling grates are begining to rust through. The porcelain is burned off and the grate is rusted through.It's costed me over $150.00 in replacement parts already.I would not reccomend that you cover your grill if left outside. The cover will keep the moisture inside the grill and the components will rust out."
4,Worth the replacement effort,"Can't say too much for a replacement ignitor system but it works. It installed as easily as expected, and appeared to be of a slightly better quality than the part that it replaced. If the previous part is any indication, it should last about 5-7 years, hard to believe in this time of designed obsolesence."
3,Its.......ok,"Mega man X3 is an, how can i say it? an ok game. It's fun but the part with the chip that you can only put in one of mega man's armor parts is really annoying? Why can't you upgrade all of mega man's stuff. Kind of boring but its mega man so its not all that bad."
2,Overrated game and megaman at his worst,"why is this game so expensive???!!! It was by far the worst megaman game ( along with x5 and x6). And i beat them all might i add. But x3 had nothing new. The only two things new is u can play as zero. BUT if u die with him, he is gone for the rest of the game. And there are 8 capsules. But 4 are the normal armor and the other 4 are extras. But u can only get one extra. Megaman x1 is alot better and so is x4. Get those two and u are set."
5,sweet but there is a way to get it better,"its great and all but the price is super highbest bet is to get the mega man x collection for ps2...usually 7.00$ new and has the whole x series, sadly x3 has the psx music instead of the snes music, (however x2 and x1's snes music still remain)other than that, this game pwns, i would get this instead of metroid any time"
3,Decent game,"I much prefer the original Mega Man series to this, but the MMX games themselves have been fun, with enough similar game elements as the original series. Basically you're Megaman X hunting and bringing down maverick robots, but in this game you can also play as Zero."
3,"Good game, but not worth the price of admission","First off, I would like to say that finding a new, factory sealed Mega man X3 costs over $200 (even a used copy costs just under 130 bucks), so unless you have a lot of money to burn, or absolutely need this game, avoid it.As far the as the game itself goes, it's not too bad. It marks the very first time you get to play as Zero, and it has more capsules to discover. With all standard Megaman fare in the game, it makes it a solid side scroller. But it also brings us back to reason why this game should be avoided: THE HUGE PRICE TAG! Being standard megaman fare, it just isn't worth the money to shoot bad guys and beat a boss. After all, it is still just a standard side scroller.All in all, the game is good, but I just feel there should be a better reason for a game to be so expensive."
3,Biofeedback stress reliever review,"This device didn't work the first time it was sent and I had to get it replaced (which was done VERY efficiently, I might add). The new device works, but it is complicated to do anything but the basic breathing exercise. Also, I have difficulty getting the ear piece working. However, even the basic breathing exercise has been very helpful. In fact, I am now able to simulate usage of the device while on the golf course (and other times of stress) by breathing and imagining the read-out on the device. It calms me down and is definitely a stress reducer. I just need to take the time now to figure out all the other things I can do with the device. NOTE: It could use better instructions. That could help quite a bit."
1,Very expensive!,It seems to measure the pulse and heart variability but not very exactly. The price is quite quite high. There are other products that offer more for a similar price (like Relaxing Rhythms by Wilddivine).
2,"Disappointing, plus there's a learning curve","If anyone thinks that buying something like a personal biofeedback device will allow them to short-circuit all the training in mind-control and meditation, they are in for a let-down. This device is nice enough, though the lack of an LCD read out and the necessity of deciphering all the weird colored markings is something only a Klingon could understand! For $180, I think this is a very disappointing device. Plus, the 5 difficulty levels are a joke. I ""mastered"" levels 1 and 2 in the first sitting, if the green color is to be trusted. The higher levels didn't take very long to ""master"" either so where's the challenge? Maybe if I spent a lot of time with it, I might get something out of it. But so far I am very underwhelmed."
1,Poor quality,"I bought this product a few years ago and, sadly, didn't use it much. I probably got about 30 uses out of it before I put it in a drawer and forgot about it. I just pulled it out of said drawer to find it ""dead."" I thought it needed to be recharged...it melted.It is out of warranty so is now headed to the garbage. The manufacturer has offered to sell me a current model. After this experience, I will not purchase any product from this company.Save your money and take meditation classes. This product is an overpriced piece of junk."
1,emwave personal stress reducer,"I bought this item and boy what a waste of money. It is simply lights to tell you when to breathe, I already knwo this and probably half the population of the world knows to regulate breathing when stressed and slow your heartbeat, this is a gimmick and a sorry one at that. I am thoroughly disappointed and will not be using this gimmick item with flashy lights. thats just about all it does. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!emWave Personal Stress Reliever (Silver)"
2,Very Pricey Toy,"When not stressed I could get the ""GREEN"" (best) light all the time within the first ""session"". After a fight with my husband I tried it and even though my breathing followed the lights perfectly I couldn't get past yellow and kept going back to red. Thus, I'm not sure if breathing always contributes to lowering your heart rate. In fact, I was getting more frustrated that I couldn't get to green even though I was breathing accordingly. No doubt keeping my heart rate higher!Also, I never use it. I used it a few times when I first got it. If you have a lot of time and patience this might work for you. If you're a busy person, save the money and get yourself a massage instead."
1,Not a Medical Device,"From the Box ""This is not a medical device."" I found no difference after using it. The only thing it relieved was my money."
1,Toy,"I bought this Toy, I mean device to help out with some stress in my life. I can tell you there is nothing magical or scientific about this. If you have to much money and need to throw some away, this is your golden ticket."
4,A very good comprehensive portrait of Tony Kushner,"Actually I would rate this item a bit higher. Perhaps 4.5 stars? It's very well done, full of important information, detailed, and, the most important aspect, intelligent. I am also very happy because that's what I really wanted and needed, that's the thing that I expected when I ordered it. And I'm definitely not disappointed. A real comprehensive portrait indeed. Proper for scholars, drama and theater lovers, well, everybody, who's interested in Tony Kushner's works."
3,For experts...,"This product probably would work great for an expert or someone with some experience in glass cutting. I had no experience with cutting glass and was trying to cut off the bottom of wine bottles for centerpieces at our wedding (have candles underneath). Anyway, it worked great for etching the glass like it was suppose to but with the thick wine bottles it was hard to keep a straight line and have a clean enough edge to sand down. It really just came down to my lack of experience or perhaps the application was trying to use it on."
2,thumbs down,"I guess I expected more of a breakfast sausage taste. these are very like the hotdogs (which I like very much). So, if I am buying ""dogs"", I will just buy ""dogs"" in the future. I do like the other products just fine. It's great to have veg options for a quick meal!"
2,Saucettes are OK,"After reading the reviews on this site, I purchased a whole case of Saucettes off of Amazon.com. I was a little dissapointed. I was expecting them to taste just like the frozen Morning star Farms links. But, the flavor was MUCH milder than them, and I was dissapointed. They have the same flavor, but are not as spicy nor as flavorful. I tried breaking them up and using them as taco meat and they weren't so bad that way. If I could do things over again, I would have bought a can at a health food store and tried them out first. I would reccomend that others do the same since some people really like them."
3,good price on Amazon,"I bought one can at a Safeway grocery store and it cost me almost $8.00. However I am glad I just bought the one can. As a carnivore, it is definitely NOT anywhere NEAR as good as the Morningstar Farms frozen veggie sausage (which is AWESOME!) Kelloggs makes Saucettes and Morningstar Farms stuff. My son wouldn't touch the stuff. However, as a SURVIVALIST it would definitely come in handy as a somewhat decent tasting protein source with a respectable shelf life. My advice is to try a CAN of it first before deciding to buy $66 worth of it."
4,Beechwood Coaster set.,"This set of coasters is a very good value. I believe it to be the largest set of coasters available(if number is important to you). They aren't fancy, but nice, and very durable. They certainly fit the bill for my needs and I would highly recommend them to anyone."
3,Middle of the road quality,Not a bad set. we have used it about a year and 1 of the coasters has warped and cracked but they get a lot of use.Glass does not stick to coaster which is the main reason why we bought them.
5,"Real Men, Real Music","The playing on this cd is come of the finest I have ever heard. Tone, sensitivity, interpretation, lyricism, rhythmic power and sense of humor... It's just about everything you could hope to hear from the instrument. But the effect of this particular cd is not limited to the sound. Somehow this artist achieved the effect of extending himself and the composers directly to listeners as if he were in performance. The humorous, personal descriptions he's included in his liner notes bring this experience to life in a unique way that has been extremely successful with my students. I whole-heartedly recommend Passionately Unstuffed and look forward to Mr. Finkelmeyer's next project."
5,One of the Best Ever,"I bought this book used, as it has been out of print for some time. It was recommended by one of my wife's friends, and it ranks among the best books I have ever read. If you want to get a feel for the Catholic and the Jewish views of each other at the end of WWII, this book will be enlightening. I'm really disappointed that I can find nothing on the internet (or anywhere else for that matter) about the author Robert Lewis. It would be a shame if this is the only book he wrote, although this brilliantly written novel would be enough to place the author among the greats of the 20th century."
4,"Michel, Michel","""Michel, Michel"" is an amazing book. I consider it my crowning jewel as far as reading is concerned. It took me a while to get through, and it's a very in-depth story, but one worth reading. This is a must-read for any serious literature lover."
3,Interesting Piece of Americana,"While vastly inferior to Jane Austen, who followed a few years later, Rowson does stand out as one of the better early-American writers. In a style foreshadowing Harriet Beecher Stowe, Rowson shows how life punishes vice. The second book, Lucy Temple, is less pedantic and more entertaining. This book is best for enthusiasts of early American Literature."
2,"Interesting, But Not Objective.","I don't think this book is intended for the spiritually curious or for those looking for an objective comparison of belief systems. While it does share a good bit of history and interpretations from one branch of the Christian faith, it also comes across as rather contemptuous of other belief systems. If the purpose was to educate, this is not a successful piece. Rather, it seems to cause those of an opposing or curious view to reject this author's stance out of mere self-protection and escape from insult. However, if the purpose was to further validate those already on board with the author's philosophy, Congratulations."
1,AWFUL,"This was the worst book I've ever read. Using the Bible to prove that Christianity is the one true religion is like using the Koran to prove Islam is the one true religion. In other words, you make your agruments ""relative"", i.e. related to whatever scripture you happen to follow. If truth is absolute why would it need the Bible, or the Koran for that matter, to make it's arguments? Wouldn't absolute truth transend them all? Is God so petty as to allow only one way to reach him? All rivers flow to the ocean, no matter in which direction they flow. Is God any smaller than the ocean?This is a great book if you're already a believer (and therefore it's worthless). But if it's goal is to convince people with doubts, this book is a total and complete failure (and therefore it's worthless).I wish someone could recommend on this site a truly worthwhile book on Christianity for me.(A book I would recommend to others: ""The Perennial Philosophy"" by Aldous Huxley)"
3,Room Service/At The Circus,"You just have to love zany and discombobulation to like this type of movie. If you are a Marx Brothers' lover, you'll probably enjoy. I cannot even explain the zanyness of these to films. They had me going and coming and seem to never get there. Lucille Ball was a highlight though in Room Service. She's always a delight to watch. :)"
4,Classic Comedy!!!,"Room Service- This is a really funny movie! Groucho is about to be evicted, so a playwriter puts on a play to help them all with money. The problem is, the manager wants them all out that day, which is the day before the play. The Marx Brothers pretend the writer is sick and can't be moved. During the play, the writer pretends to be dying and stall until they make the money. If you love the Marx Brothers, and classic comedy, you'll love ROOM SERVICE!!!At The Circus- This was a pretty funny movie! It wasn't as good as other Marx Bros. movies, but it's still alright. Jeff Wilson is robbed of $10,000, and Tony Pirelli hires Detective Loophole to solve the case. Loophole, Pirelli, and Punchy use all sorts of wierd, wacky, and unorthodox methods of getting the money back. if you love classic comedy, and the Marx Brothers, you'll love AT THE CIRCUS!!!"
3,Room Service awful/At the Circus amusing,"Far from the heights, these two Marx Brothers movies are, respectively, at the very bottom and near the middle of their achievements. ""Room Service"" is painfully flat, utterly devoid of whimsy or humor. Perfunctory appearances by Lucille Ball and Ann Miller do not improve things. ""At the Circus"" has some grand moments and while it's no ""Monkey Business,"" it's got some nice Dumont/Groucho stuff and the ""colored music"" scene is not as racist as I'd remembered."
3,I love the Marx Brothers!,Room Service is so funny and a classic. Too bad At the Circus is on the other side - but - I would suggest that you forget that it's there and just enjoy Room Service.
3,New SNES Controller wire length,The new controller works like a charm. The length of the controller wire is too short.
2,not too good,"The shipping makes it way over priced for its quality. The buttons are really stiff, and in no way is as good as the original. Though it works. Also the color and shape is not as good, duller and uglier. Compared to the original I wouldn't recommend, but I also do not know where to buy the original."
1,knock off,"decent attempt at a knock off, but its bootleg as hell. they should be selling these with crack so you can get something worth the money being spent."
5,Fantastic!,"Given the age of the hardware, I had low expectations for the controller. However, these expectations were blown away. The d-pad and buttons are tight and responsive, and the product was well packaged.Would order from this seller again."
1,"Sellers selling SNES pads claiming ""NEW""","I had doubts buying a game pad from sellers stating this and i was right.Be aware of sellers using something like this for a description.""BRAND NEW IN BOX! *****NOTICE**** CONTROLLERS HAVE THE OFFICAL NINTENDO SEAL OF QUALITY BUT OUR NOT MADE BY NINTENDO ANY MORE. (IT IS THE ONE PICTURED ABOVE)""I ordered one of these and........1.Cable was torn.2.Packaged was not sealed and looks like the box was just reused to repackage extremely cheap knockoffs.3.Cord is only around 4 feet.4.The button labeling is a soft rubber sticker.I honestly cant believe nintendo seriously licensed the game pad rights to a company that would create such a cheap thing.Your better off buying a used pad,other than risk getting ripped off."
2,knock off,"not the official snes controller, no way its licenced by nintendo like it says on the box, says its new but its got these scratches all over it, buttons are a bit hard to press down. It works but it defently doesnt have the same feel when it comes to the buttons. Go ahead and buy if you dont mind the whole button thing and dont mind if its not in perfect shape"
2,Short,"The buttons feel like new again, i was still using the original ones from when i first got the snes in '95 but the start button wore out, the only issue i had with these was that the cord is at least a foot shorter than the originals which i didn't like because old school game consoles all had longer cords than the new ones."
3,Snes controller Remake not so bad,The super nintendo controller you are looking at is not made by nintendo whoever it is licensed to be made so that aside its not the original lokks a hell of alot like it feels like it but it has a much shorter cord other then that its fine it plays the games and even says nintendo on it how bad could it be. by the way i have sold hundreds of these in our store and even more then that online and we have recieved 4 back the entire time i have been selling them call it luck but thats pretty good considering other things we have had returned ie wii motes
2,"Dpad is horrible, the rest of the buttons are ok","This is an Ok controller if you never need to duck. For some reason the down direction on the Dpad acts as if you tapped it when you're holding it down. This basically makes it useless for most side scrolling and top down games. The rest of the buttons work, but are pretty stiff. I wouldn't mind the stiffness if the dpad functioned correctly."
2,This sucks,This controller is NOT like the original. It is very stiff and hard to use. Also the cord is much shorter than the original. Very dissapointing.
1,snes is awesome. knock off controller is not.,if you like any games like mortal combat or street fighter it is impossible on these controllers. d pad is very weird. kind of stiff and just different from the original. for instance. i use sub zero in mortal combat. move such as Down Forward B dont work because the controller gets stuck between down and forward and you cannot perform the action quick enough.
3,A must-have for the snes console,It serves its purpose. You just can't play any video games on you snes console unless you have this controller.
3,Doesn't hold a candle to original,The pricing is good on this item until you add in shipping and once you get the controller you find out that the cable is a little over half the length of the original SNES controller. Definitely a cheap imitation of the original. Caveat emptor. It does the job but it's a faint shadow of the original.
3,SNES controller,This was a good product and there was fast communcation between the seller and the buyer. I appreciated the good exchange time.
4,A replacement for our Nintendo clone,"We used to play Nintendo in college, so I figured this a clone Nintendo game console would be a good nostalgic Christmas present for him. Overall it seemed to work pretty well, except my room-mate reported that the buttons weren't as responsive as he remembers. It's hard to know if that's true or if he's romanticizing his younger days. I went ahead and got this original super nintendo controller and he seems to be complaining less. :)"
3,No box but good.,"You don't get what the image shows but i did get an official snes controller, not a knock off so that's good. We'll see how it works... it's a gift for someone else."
2,don't by this controller....,"it has hard press buttons, it directinal pad is all out of wack when u are trying to clibe up ladder etc."
1,Copy,"It's not the original and it doesn't work, it looks cheap. I thought it was the original from 1990's but it feels like cheap plastic. Don't buy."
1,Not very good,"I got this when i dug my snes out and started playing it. But when i wanted to play super mario world on multiplayer i could not find the second controller. I looked everywhere. Anyway when i bought this one it looked great. But it was not. When u start to use it u notice that the cord is way shorter than the original controller, it is not even the same as the other because it does not say snes on it it just says nintindo but that does not really matter, and the worst of all the buttons stick and they r really stiff and hard to use. So now when u play multiplayer u r not even close to as good as u r with the original. Save ur money and buy the original one."
2,disappointed,"I bought this so I can play some retro SNES games...the controller stopped working completely after a month. Not sure what to make of that...It was a used controller, so I imagine something was wrong with it to begin with so this is really on the seller"
2,controller,This controller SUCKS. I used it for about a month before it stopped working. I had to buy another one.
3,"Works well, but arrived used & dirty","The controllers (I bought 2) work great. The buttons do not stick. However, the condition was worse than the advertised description led me to believe. The controllers were scratched all over, and grime had settled in the scratches."
5,Entertaining and Informative,"The book was entertaining and if you are planning to do the Pilgrimage it is informative. I saw the movie ""The Way"" and was curious about the book it was based on. The movie is not a word for word adaptation, but you can see the elements of the book in the story of the movie.As usual the book goes into more depth and more of the feeling the author feels than you would get in the film. The book has a main plot that does not center on a character outside of the author as much as the movie does. But there are characters in both the book and the movie as well as quotations.The book is well done (though a bit wordy) and is a good read even if you have not seen the movie. I enjoyed the book and recommend it, and especially so if you are planning the pilgrimage of Saint James in Spain."
4,A great companion to The Way,"For anyone who has seen The Way and read the book the Emilio and Martin wrote together, this book is a must read in order to get all the background information you need to fully understand the movie. I highly recommend it."
2,A road I wouldn't recommend,"Save this book for a very long plane ride going nowhere. Its---Ok. Yeah, Mr. Hitt is very detailed about his pilgrim's progress, yeah, he doesn't tell us why exactly he is a pilgrim---thats good---but.....I just was not impressed with this book. It wasn't a life changer. Was this journey a life changer for the author? If you are looking for a read that gives you----something----an insight, a little education, a little relief from boredom....look elsewhere. Its not entirely too clear to me why this book was written in the first place. Its as rambling as the many pilgrim roads his feet trod upon. Read it if you're a relative or a friend, but my advice would be to skip and reexamine Canterbury Tales.....again......"
4,with critical humour,"For my recent compilation of pilgrimage quotations (""Ultreia! Onward! Progress of the Pilgrim"") I read all 40 or so contemporary English journal accounts available about the various routes. Hitt's is clearly within the first grouping of 8 or so best such books (i.e. largely those written by established authors and/or academics). This was the third or fourth pilgrimage account I read and after plowing through another couple of dozen of such I remained impressed by both the sense of humour and critical eye that Hitt brought to describing his trip. One finds much here about the various characters that one is likely to encounter along the route and Hitt is accurate in his portrait of the moving circus that the camino has unfortunately become."
2,Off the Beaten Path,"I honestly must say I was disappointed with this book. The author writes well, very descriptively, and he provides much history in relation to sites on the path. However, the author does admit that he is not a religious person and is quick to point out many of the odd and not really good practices in the history of the church. This is ok, I guess, but I would be more interested in his inner journey which he keeps at bay from the reader. So I found this book to be a description of events on a walk which is meant to be a pilgrimage, a spiritual journey. It is my own fault for expecting to read the effects of the journey but all I know is he met strange characters, got very tired and sometimes afraid of wild dogs and some people but otherwise it is oddly a soulless journey of what is historically a spiritual journey or a journey within one's heart at least. I was disappointed but read until the end hoping for a glimmer which i never found."
1,Las horas del dia,You send the wrong DVD twice and finally you decided that it was better to give me a refund since you did not know when the movie was going to beavailable.
1,Not a good invention.,"As much as Nintendo comes out with fabulous products, they come out with some really bad ones too! This was something that you put into your cartridge slot, and then put the game into the X Band. Then you would plug a phone line into your X Band, and play your game with people everywhere in the world that are using the X Band. Pretty simple, however as the other review stated, the X Band service was discontinued six years ago."
4,Sock Monkey :),"This guy is just the right size. The kit comes with two large socks, felt, pompom for the hat, buttons, everything you see, except for the thread and stuffing. Even though it comes with a needle, it doesn't include the thread, which I found frustrating since I didn't have off-white/tan thread. I ended up using white, which wasn't as nice looking. But, this is an awesome set, and at a great price. The shipping is what does you in though (mine was 5.95). Overall, great buy and a lot of fun. This is simple enough to make, even for a fairly novice sewer like myself."
3,Brings back memories.,"I dont see why so many people hated this game. Yeah, the fighting style is nothin like mortal kombat or the street fighter games of the old. But, come on were could you get superman the flash and batman in one game, fighting it out?, back in the day. This game brought back a lot memories for me when I was a kid. I recommend it for the fun of it."
2,Fair,"I agree with the other reviewer--the installation was extremely difficult. I have done others in a matter of 15 mins., this one had great difficulty due to the brackets and their inability to go into the cabinet properly. Also, the fan is loud, but has zero power. It does not have enough suction to make a paper towel stick to the filter. That was very surprising and disappointing.The unit looks great, and the microwave action is ok."
4,rockin' and rollin',"Mellow and Jazzy.Tracks 4,8 and 9 stand out.Picked this album up after a stereolab concert,this album is a solo project from the lead singer of stereolab.They are excellent live (they had about 10 people wedged on the stage jamming)"
1,don't waste your money!!!!!!,"amazon shows picture of item with 14 pieces. I opened box,only 5 pieces were shipped. I now have to drive 40 miles to hardware store to get missing parts.will not buy from this vendor again..."
3,Down disco's memory lane...,"To restate what some have said: This CD reflects the original vinyl release sequencing with no breaks between songs on ""Side 1"" or ""Side 2"" (only a natural break between the two sides themselves). I almost didn't pick this up after reading complaints that gaps had been inserted between songs. Thankfully, that's not the case here."
4,Disco goes on holiday,"This is a fine concept album that takes your imagination on a bit of a journey away from the usual disco themes centered around the dancefloor, shaking your thing and being in/out of love. Musically it blends a few ""exotic"" influences that make it a little more diverse sounding than your average disco themed LP. The last song on the first side with the ""tahiti style"" disco number is the most obvious example. However it remains firmly ""disco"" in spirit suggesting good times and an escape from the everyday. I listen to a lot of electronic/dance music and I am quite entertained by it whenever I put it on."
5,Excellent!,"Nowadays unifying the increasing number of disciplines could be the key to reveal the secrets of those aspects of nature which remain incomprehensible to us. Following this line and containing some very original hypothesis, this book is an attempt to board immunology from a different perspective, a perspective that turns to be attractive not only for the specialized immunologist, but for anyone interested in the subject."
1,Puhleeeze!,One of the great hoaxes of the last century. Satan himself marks Michelle with his tail to her neck? Puhleeeze!
1,A dangerous propaganda work,"The author himself has denounced the work as untrue. It was this book which started the SRA panic of the eighties which destroyed the lives many innocent people. SRA is an urban legend now attributed to false memory syndrome, and to continue its propagation is folly. If as many people as these myths state have been victims of SRA were in existence, half of the US would have MPD. As it stands now, the psychiatric field is questioning the existence of MPD at all! Only the staunchest Fundamentalists still believe in it. How many more people must be persecuted because of ignorance and lies?"
1,Does anyone out there NOT know this was faked?,Open your eyes and read the truth:http://www.witchvox.com/whs/kerr_pazder1.html
3,THIS BOOK IS PURE TERROR,"I read this book around the time it came out when I was 12 years old. It had a tremendous effect on me. Not only was I nearly paralyzed with terror at the descriptions, but I began to wonder if the same thing had happened to me. I wondered if I too had repressed memories. I see people have written that this book started a whole wave of SRA confessions, but all I can say is for many months, I would lie rigid in my bed waiting for the devil to take me away. Its intense power, whether fact or fiction, cannot be denied. Yikes!"
4,scary stuff,"I read this book in 1985, I was 15 at the time. I have to admit that when I first read it I found it difficult to beleive these horrors could be true. A few months later I went to Victoria to stay with my aunt for a few months. During this time I met some people who at one time belonged to this satanic coven that Michelle speaks of. I asked them questions about things that I had read in Michelle's book. I was expecting them to say that she lied or over exagerrated. Much to my surprise they confirmed her testimony. I was also told that many people who work in Victoria parlaiment belong to the church."
1,Never Received my Order,I ordered a used copy of Michelle Remembers from Amazon. I never received my order. I won't be using Amazon again. Last time I used Amazon my order arrived over a month late in tattered condition.
1,Metaphysics for Dummies,"It's not surprising that there are literal-minded, dichotomous thinkers who like this stuff. It is more disheartening that people with doctoral and medical degrees and board certification in psychiatry fell for it. For example, the top psychiatrists at the Rush-Pres. St Luke's Dissociative Disorders Unit in Chicago (before it was sued out of existence) perpetrated SRA on people who should themselves have known better.If you like easy answers (devil causes all evil, childhood abuse causes all emotional discomfort) this is the book for you. The miracle here is how Michelle, Dr Pazder, and the incompetent ghost writer managed to make lurid tales of abuse so deadly dull."
1,Mighty bad.,"It's not that I don't believe Michelle's story, necessarily--it's just that her telling of it is UNBELIEVABLY boring. It's hard to imagine a story about being victimized by a Satanic cult as a child being dull, but this one is."
1,Only one good thing about this book,"There is only one thing surrounding this book that is any good.... The five star reviews on here. I suggest reading them as they are filled with delusional and hilarious posts. On a side note, yes there is a Church of Satan, you can even visit their website, but they just worship another make believe entity. What's the difference?"
1,Witch Hunt,"Yes, this book is a work of fiction. There never was a Michelle. There has never been a case of Satanic Ritual Abuse in North America. Real Satanists do not believe in a literal Satan, but as an archetype. Anton LaVey founded Satanism in 1966 in San Francisco with a bunch of hippies. Today the group remains post-hippie fallout and counter-culture members, none of which really believe in Satan. This book sparked an intolerant and bigoted anti-Satanism movement that ruined people's lives. This book is like McCarthy's list. Support this book and support bigotry. With hunts happen today, and this book is a leading cause.... If you value freedom you will not enjoy this book."
4,"Fact or Fiction, Who Cares?","Alright, everyone who has reviewed this book is caught up on whether or not it was a true story but why does it really matter? Even books and movies written about real occurences are edited a little to make the story more intersting, and the special effects more exciting.If you are reading this book purely for pleasure and don't care whether or not it was true then it was a great book, and I would suggest it to any unbiased reader. But if you are reading it purely because you think it is a ""Real Story"" then you should be shopping for a Biography or History book.All I can say is that I thoroughly enjoyed Michelle's story and I think most readers will too."
3,page review,"I cannot find a single bit of information on this product and I do not want to order till I have some information to see if this item will work for my application. I need a sending unit and a 3 1/2"" - 3 3/8"" tachometer head for a 3208 CAT diesel natural aspirated 210 hp marine engine. Thank you."
5,This product made running fun again!,"I recently signed up for a half-marathon. My dog can only run a few miles, so once he gets tired, I just toss him in the stroller. It's made running fun for me again! It feels like I have a partner and seeing him curled up, enjoying the fresh air and the scenery, makes the run even more enjoyable. There is also plenty of room to carry water for both of us and any other items I might need (cell phone, etc.). This product is very sturdy and easy to put together. One caution: be careful not to over-inflate the tires. I've blown 2 tubes already."
1,Thumbs down,"Very judgemental in tone, and the author seems to confuse quantity of scripture quoting with quality of writing. I had mental whiplash trying to follow the stream of a paragraph amidst all the quotes. There are better books on this subject, don't bother with this one."
4,Works for me,"I've had this puppy about 3 months now, and i'm very satisfied.It's simple to set up, and works fine. The TIVO portion works great, and the DVD player works great too.I agree with some folks below about recording HDTV. You can't do it. That's the only bummer. I'll deduct one star in my rating for that. But I didn't want to wait a few years for an affordable HDTV/Tivo/Dvd Burner.This is so easy to use, even my kids figured it out in no time.The burner is very cool in my opinion. I've transferred some TV recordings for friends super easily. If they miss an episode of Smallville, I'll burn it for them.I've moved a lot of old Camcorder Tapes very easily to DVD with this unit as well.Niceness"
4,disappointed,"The RS-TX20 DVD Recorder works well and as advertised. I especially like the free TiVo Basic and don't see a need for the advanced features. However, this unit was shipped in the original box without benefit of a shipping box. Also, the instructions indicated that I was entitled to 1 month free TiVo advanced but the unit said that I had only 6 days left. This led me to believe that this unit was previously used. Since I did not receive a return shipping label, I was not able to return the item to the shipper. Rest assured -- I will never buy from this seller again."
1,nothing but problems,"I purchased this as a gift and the first time we used the DVD player, the menu was all pixillated. You couldn't see anything or play the DVD. I tried several different DVDs and none worked. I returned it and received another Toshiba RS-TX20 DVD recorder and it had nothing but the unit. No cords, no instructions, nothing. I returned it and will never use Amazon again."
4,Brenda Lee better than ever....,"I was never much of a Brenda Lee fan in the 1960s, but favoured Shirley Bassey, Connie Francis and Kathy Kirby, but times have changed and I now am a great fan of the lady. I love all her old hits and wonder why the magic passed me by for so long. Brenda Lee has such a distinct voice and this CD is no exception. All the songs are good and are known by all. My favourite is ""In The Garden"" This CD is nt everyones cup of tea but if you like songs well sung, and are in the mood for something uplifting and in the gospel line then you will enjoy this little gem."
1,JUNK!,"I agree with the other reviewers who rated this a one star toy (since 0 stars isn't an option). But I just want to add one more point to their comments about how this toy leaks and deflates easily, which was also my experience.When my son hits this bag, unlike other bop bags that bounce upright to be hit again, this one lays on the floor. He has to put it back in an upright position in order to hit it again!If this toy rated 0 stars, that would have been my rating. You might as well hold a match under your money!"
2,Not as good as I hoped.,I was really looking forward to reading this book and didn't even finish it all the way. I don't know very much about the author and I am not sure where he gets his information but it seems very outdated and not some of the information seems wrong. I am glad I didn't pay full price for this book. I am sure there is a better book on hypnois then this one. My advice is to not waste your money on this book.
2,"Hypnosis: Theory, Practice and Application","I obtained this book from the local library. The copyright date is 1950! That may explain why it seems so dated. It is! On the other hand, that very fact made the book interesting. While I don't intend to purchase this book, it was worth a quick scan--especially for the inductions-- to see how hypnosis was viewed over fifty years ago compared to today."
4,Great family film,This is a good film for the whole family. Enough fun adventures for the kids and some funny cameo appearances that the grown-ups will enjoy.
3,starts dull but ends well,"I thought the movie was pretty good; it started slow-and dull-but ended up being an interestingly funny and adventurous movie.Jackie Chan was the big name for this movie, but Steve Coogan and Cécile De France really brought it to life for me. I especially loved the childish romance that sprung up between Phileas Fogg and Monique La Roche.Some adventure, some laughs and a little romance..."
2,Family Fare = Bland,"If you have NOT seen the extrodinary Oscar-winning David Niven (1956) version or the ""period"" authenticity of the Pierce Brosnan (1989) version, you will enjoy this light hearted romp. It's fun, contemporary, but ultimately forgettable. If you have seen the the previous films, you will find this to be lightweight ""family fare"" that will neither offend nor enrich you in any way. This is a walk-through for most of the fine talent wasted here."
2,"Nice Action, Boring Story","I hesitated getting this movie after reading some of the reviews, turns out the reviews were right. The original story is fascinating and exciting, if you enjoy reading. This movie only vaguely follows the book, frittering away its great potential while thoroughly boring this viewer. Jackie Chan's fight scenes are good, which provided me an opportunity to stop snoring enough to watch a bit of the movie. I have not viewed the old classic with David Niven, but just might since this movie was a complete (almost, thanks to Jackie) waste of time and electricity."
1,get the David Niven movie instead!,"An astoundingly stupid movie, only vaguely based on the Jules Verne novel. Loud and expensive, full of unfunny jokes, dull, loud action sequences, and poor acting. Spend your money on the splendid David Niven version from 1956."
1,An Old Guy,I saw the movie today and was very disappointed. I thought I'd get to see somehting of the world and its peoples and the various modes of transportation which were actualy used at that time. Instead most of it was Jackie Chan knocking out bunches of bad guys in unrealistic fights. I saw the original many years ago. This should not even have the sam title as the Mike Todd production.
3,O.K.....But not that great.....Very Disappointing!,"I actually want to rate this movie with 2 and a half stars. When this movie came to theaters, I wanted to see it so bad! Unfortunately, I didn't get to, but I'm glad I didn't see it in theaters. I saw this movie on Starz. The beginning of this movie gets very boring, I had a hard time paying attention during the beginning. The rest of the movie gets a little more exciting, but not all that exciting. Remember when critics said that this movie was funny, well, I maybe only laughed once or twice in this movie. Heck, those two times combined, I probably only laughed for ten seconds. The action scenes in this movie weren't that great. Jackie Chan did not show his full potential in this movie. Overall, though, this movie wasn't that bad, but did satisfy me like I thought it would. I would rent this movie before buying it."
1,Rent the original.,"Around the World in 80 Days was just as bad as it looked. But you don't watch a Jackie Chan movie for plot or acting, or anything like that- you watch it for fight choreography. Unfortunately, there wasn't even enough of that to redeem this lame Disney backwash.While some parents may like the brief history lesson infused in this clean family flick, discretionary viewers will be left bored and wanting."
5,Funny!,"Thought itd be corny but it was really good, lots of twists, some jackie chan fighting, and lots of random jokes and actors appear"
4,Great movie,Streaming is sometimes interrupted. Not sure if its the Amazon server or the Internet connection in use.Bought this to show my 7th grade Social Studies classes. They loved it
4,Four Stars for Fun!,"Too the nay-sayer who said Disney bad, I say ""Pooh""! I've seen the Niven and Brosnan versions both incredibly dull. I mean how many times can you tell the same story and have it be interesting? Well this version with Chan and Coogan was terrific! It's really a vehicle for Chan's abilities, but this version injected humour, action, fighting, an interesting sub-plot of a stolen jade buddha and stars with more than quck cameos (Arnold as Turkish Hapi was hysterical). Whoever thinks this wasn't funny had their eyes closed while watching it. For some good clean fun check this movie out!"
3,AROUND THE WORLD is Worth the Trip,"Never having seen any of the previous versions of AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS, I have nothing to compare to. I'm sure that if I was a steadfast fan of the original, this new version would probably seem like a sorry excuse for a film. However, by itself, the film entertains and is definitely worthy of a rental. Jackie Chan tones it down for kids, but his playful antics keep the fun flowing and your two hours won't be wasted."
4,"Fun, goofy family version of great classic","If you want something all your family can giggle at ... this is a good choice.Yes, it's slap-stickish ... it's supposed to be. No, it doesn't closely follow Mr. Verne's version ... it's an adaptation, as are many children's versions. (Compare movie and original book for ""Mary Poppins"", ""Chitty-Chitty Bang-Bang"", ""Peter Pan"", ""Wizard of Oz"", and many other movies we think of as ""classics"" ... the differences might surprise you.)The things that give it a PG rating are relatively slight (there's much worse on ""kids"" TV programming), there's enough action to keep children on the edge of their seats, and we all (parent and kids aged 6 and 3 1/2) left the theater with a smile on our faces. So as we walked out, my husband and I looked at one another and in stereo said, ""We've gotta get that when it comes out on DVD."""
3,Not up to the David Niven original!,"Not that I expected a masterpiece, but the acting was wooden and the characters unbelievable. The martial arts fight scenes were fine and Chan was, as ever, very funny. Glad I watched it with my 9-year old grandson, watching him enjoy it was worth the 2.00 I paid for the DVD."
3,A Swashbuckling Good Movie,"Any movie with Jackie Chan has got to have lots of humor, as this one does. Although the story line is based on the original ""Around the World in 80 Days"" book, it migrates far past the original by trying to make this version appeal to children and tweens (ages 5-13). It is funny, but on a kid's level. It is cute, but I have seen better movies that Jackie Chan is in. However, any fan of Jackie Chan would definitely want to add this one to complete your collection. Good, clean fun; appropriate for families."
4,80 days,"Pretty much what i ordered, used in good shape. had a small scratch on disc, wish they would of said that. other than that good job."
2,A glossy and unfunny disaster,"This is a highly glossy, effects-filled movie as befits its $100+ million production budget.Unfortunately, as also befits its total box office take of about $24 million, the film, loosely based on the Jules Verne novel, is saddled with a stilted script, many jokes that fall flat, uninteresting cameos (except for the Brothers Wilson - Luke and Owen - who had a certain charm), and unoriginal fight choreography.Those wishing to see Jackie Chan in better form in an American production are advised to see ""Shanghai Knights""."
1,Warning: Only appropriate for 12 years old and younger,"Disclosure: I did not sit through this entire movie. The tedium and boredom won out after 60 minutes of abuse inflicted by watching this horrible film.This movie is so poorly written and acted that only viewers younger than 12 could find enough enjoyment to warrant their attention. There is nothing here that is fun, entertaining, exciting, funny, or remarkable in any way; except for its awfulness. That is remarkable."
1,it sucks!,"this movie sucked.this movie may just be out in 1 month.it just was plain boring,dumb,& a waste of money!"
4,Nice presentation of introductory material to maps,"The book uses a modern layout, presenting a number of maps that are representative for the history of chartography. After each map a double page present historical events related to that map or other information relevent to mapmaking or to the history of maps. The book is full with excelent ilustration of famous maps. This is a perfect introduction to the history of maps."
1,Would give it less than one star if I could,"This ""camera"" is a horrible disappointment. My daughter received it for her 7th birthday and as a 40 year old I was just as frustrated with it.First, it is to small no matter how they hold it there fingers are over the lens - which they can't see because the view finder and lens are not connected.Second, the bead necklace is also always in the way.Third, it takes forever between pictures to let you take another picture; it actually turned off quite a few times we had to wait so long.Uggg I can't get rid of it fast enough!!"
1,This Camera is the worst (...)I've ever spent in my life!,I bought this toy for my daughter's 7th birthday as well. It sucks. Here's why:1. After charging it for countless hours it still cuts off .2. You need the light of God to see anything in the pictures you take.3. You have to hold the camera at an awkward angle just to take a picture.4. And after all that ....It still won't take pictures.Im going to try and send it back to the company it was really a waste of money. Im going to just buy her a simple digital camera. Please don't waste your money on this toy. My 9month old could've used this as one of his toys it was so bad. I would give it 0 stars if I could.
1,You've got to be kidding,I just received this in the mail and without even opening it I can tell you it's going back tomorrow. It's about the size of a plum and thats being generous! There is no way possible for any child to take a picture without getting their finger or hand in the way of the lens. To recharge the camera you have to do it through the computer. I'm not even sure why they call it a princess as it has no princesses on it. It seemed like a good idea but the design is impossible for anyone to use. Too bad. Seems like everything I buy with Disney princess is a piece of junk. You think with all the money they are making off of this fad they would be able to make something of lasting quality!
1,Wasted my money!!,I was going to buy this for my 5 year old sister but lucky I tested it out before I gave it to her. I couldn't figure out how to take pictures with it and when I finally took some I couldn't even see what I was taking. When I tried putting a picture in the little locket it kept falling out because you have to open it up to connect it to the computer. I didn't care that it wasn't going to be that great of quality because I know it is only a kids camera but for $30 it was a waste and I don't believe I got what I paid for. It's cute but that's about it. You can buy a webcam for only $20 and it works a lot better and my sister would have more fun with that then trying to figure out how to take pictures with the camera. A little girl shouldn't have to only take pictures in the right lighting and making sure she's holding it exactly right just to be able to see a picture that is crappy anyway.
1,Huge disappointment,"My 8 year old daughter has loves to take photos with our camera so I thought this would be ideal. The problem is, the photo quality is so horrid that you can't even tell what you've photographed. We tried different lighting, different distances, different locations and still haven't gotten ONE photo that we could recognize had we not been there when it was taken. This is NOT a camera....it's an overpriced plastic necklace."
2,collection: really rosie / music / tapestry,not what I expected one out of threee is not a good return on investment
4,WOW! what a good movie!,"WOW! this was a REALLY good movie. i was a bit nervous to watch it, but I am so glad I did. You definately don't need to be a mountain climber to enjoy this movie. It had everything drama, suspense, romance. really well done great cinematography. Great store. I highly recommend this movie, very moving"
5,Great mountaineering movie,"This movie was much better than I anticipated. Genuine emotion, suspense, just a well done movie. Unexpected ending and story line as well, I didn't know what I was in for."
5,Very intense drama,Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Everyone who watched it found it intense. Wish it did not have a sad ending.
5,Simply a Magnificent Movie,"I am rarely inspired to comment on movies. This one is simply too good to leave hidden. On every level this film excels and is memorable.From the very first frames, the cinematography shows careful framing of every image. The landscapes are so spectacular that you cannot communicate them in words. Everything is vast and yet made intimate. You are really made to feel like you are scaling the mountain.The film communicates a sense of culture in a very intimate and realistic way. You feel as if you are a witness to Germany and Austria in 1936. These are very believable 1936 Germans. You don't feel you are watching actors.The tragedy is enormous, but there is also a cautionary tale here about hubris and decision making as well. It is a tough movie to watch, even for a hardened adult. I don't recommend this one for young children. But for those who can stomach watching the cruelty of this kind of alpine environment, this is a truly magnificent movie."
1,German Cheese,"Imagine every cliche in Hollywood vomited onto a mountain. We have the ""underdog"" dynamic (that's the one where the 'anti-NAZI' brothers beat the NAZIs). We have a sordid love affair with a blithering bimbo who decides to go ice climbing in high-heels. Then there is the ""bad guy"", a NAZI of course, who just wants to drink wine, eat veal and sit by a warm fire while our courageous brothers risk their lives trying to climb a huge ice cube wearing pajamas and tennis shoes. In the end the brothers all die and the ice-bimbo moves to New York to take pictures of black musicians (presumably to prove her open-minded anti-NAZI bona-fides). But, of course, she'll never love like THAT again. Blech! This movie is trash!"
3,Gets bogged down,"This newish German film is interesting to see how Germany today treats its Nazi history. Here, we cheer two half-hearted Nazis in 1936 when they were urged to conquer the Eiger face in the Alps to help Hitler drum up excitement for his Berlin Olympics. I was surprised to see in the special features that most of this is digital special effects, but they are well done. The 'romance' with the girl newspaper photographer and one of the stoic climbers makes no sense: he shows zero interest in her, yet she climbs out on the mountain to try to save him? Absurd. The cutting back and forth between the drama on the mountain and fat and happy Nazis in the mountain hotel detracts from the action. The inevitable tragedy is gripping."
1,"content good, delivery bad","The content was very good, however, the video was plagued with static, stalled transmission (or some such...I know nothing about technical issues)."
3,North Face (2008) - Blu Ray,"The movie itself is great, but the Blu-ray version does not have the extras that a regular Dvd would have. On a Dvd, they show the helicopter view of the Eiger which is beautiful. The blu-ray doesn't have that. Also, on the interviews with the actors, the blu-ray only has the interview written with no video of the actor. If I had known that I would have purchased the regular Dvd instead of Blu-ray."
5,My hands are still sweaty!!!,This is truly a cliffhanger! I could hardly watch the last 20 minutes of the movie - I could not handle the suspense. If you've ever climbed this movie will leave you wanting more.
5,Great Movie,"If you want a movie that will move you, buy this one, I was still moved by the movie days later, it is a very gripping story and true. Sad but true!!"
4,I understand the high reviews but it's too sad,"*Spoler alert*I don't want to spoil anything. The movie is for themost part pretty decent. It seems kind of short and just overall like a short brief tale that hurts the heart. I found the to be a very sad movie with a sad ending....Good storie of comradery , team work , and doing the right thing! I give it 3 and half stars."
1,Great movie... too bad I can't play it....,"I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out. Love the movie, and was excited to have the dvd with all of the bonus features.Unfortunately, this dvd is ""coded for a different region, and cannot be played"" in my region (ie... the USA). I'm a little unhappy about this, and with the disc coming from the UK, exchange is going to be difficult. It'd be nice if Amazon would sell items which would actually be usable here."
1,Correction,"Note the info contained in this bio is many years out of date. For current info, see Lesch's webpage at Trinity University (trinity.edu)"
3,The Wonder Child,"I was disappointed in the book; perhaps I was looking for something different than was there. I had read Marion's Tambourine and enjoyed it as an anthology of Jewish folktales. This book included fewer of them and just seemed less meaty. Frankly, even to a child I would think the book I named firs-- Marion's Tambourine-- would be the better book even if there were no pictures."
1,This company SPAMS,"How did I first hear about this item? Well, someone was nice enough to spam me with a link to this exact page. Wasn't an affiliate, so it must have been someone associated with the company.[].That's reason enough for one star."
5,Cop This One,"Considering his initial worldwide popularity. Every song on this album is contemporary R&B at its greatest and deserves to be on vol. 1. I totally recommend this album to any new or longtime R&B fan.Cop This One!He is diffenently one of the Hottest ProducerEver in the R&B, Hip Hop/ Neo-Soul Genre.BANGIN! BANGIN! BANGIN! The Boy is HOT LikeFIRE!"
1,Ridiculously Bad!,Avoid at ALL costs. Got this album from a friend. I will never speak to that friend again!
2,CAUTION: This CD is aight--much better artists out there....,"Might I recommend going to CDStreet and buying either SEAN-GEMINI or KEITH WOLFE instead? ""G"" has good production, but you'll see the difference when you hear their stuff--no contest. They both have great CDs available and they didn't use spam to get it to the public"
1,spammed,"I just got a newsgroup spam for this. It is now the year 2004, and this was released in 2001. Why promote something three years old? How about you release something new with some audio clips to check out. The song titles sound cliché"
2,Not the greatest,"Don't buy this book expecting alot. I could get much better tips for FREE from somebodys webpage.This book in my opinion is a waste of time if you plan to read it, and a waste of money if you plan to buy it. I hope if you read my review you will be smart enough not to buy this book."
5,Definately HOT Cinnamon Candy,"This candy is listed as HOT and it's not false advertising. If you really want HOT cinnamon candy, this is it. This is closer in heat to atomic fireballs than to cinnamon imperials."
4,Great game. Too bad it goes unnoticed.,"Excellent old-school RPG, and by old school I mean don't go expecting this game to push the graphical limits of the SNES. The gameplay is great as long as you don't expect it to be something fancy. It's a very basic - almost NES era - style RPG, but that's a good thing.I had this game for a while, but I sold it along with most of my SNES collection a few years ago when I was in need of money, but I nabbed it from Amazon's marketplace for $12, so I'm happy :)If you can find this game for like $10-$15 definitely give it a try. Who knows, maybe it'll end up on the Wii lineup someday."
4,A sourcebook for the thirteenth century,"This book studies the historical context of the life of Charles of Anjou : Economics, Geography, Warfare, the different provinces of the Angevin Empire... This is not a biography of Charles of Anjou, since different point of views are adopted in each chapter, not necessarily in chronological order. For the story of his life go for Runciman's Sicilian Vespers. Read this book if you want a more detailed description of the Mediterranean in the 13th Century."
4,Great book but different from what was expected.,"I was somewhat disappointed in that the author seemed to focus more on times before capture than times inside the prison camp and mine. The book seemed to jump around alot and the writing styles seem to change from chapter to chapter which detracted from the stories the auther told. Over all though, he went into great detail in describing to the readers about what made each man unique. The author shows an incedible talent in portraying each man's stengths and weaknesses. He shows how even the Japanese guards that tormented them had human and good qualities that kept him from hating them outright. This book seems to focus more the human soul than the life of a prisoner."
2,skates,The skates themselves were great comfortable. The wheels and stoppers needed to be replaced as well as the barings. For what I spent on all that I could of bought better skates.
1,no way!,"I was looking at this TV, but after reading the reviews here, there is no way that I'm paying all that money for a TV that I have to drill holes in. Anyone that drills holes in a new TV must have a hole in their head."
5,Folklore of American Weather,"I like Eric Sloane's books but lost the whole set in moving. Yes,the truckers do steal you items.I came into a little money so decided to rebuy the books."
4,Great lens wtih a great price with only minor flaws,I love this lens. I really wanted something faster than 3.8 for my portrait work. This lens gives me zoom with the speed I need. My only complaint is that somtimes it seeks for the focus and I have missed a few shots because of this. If you can take your time with what you are shooting this is not a big deal for you. Great Lens!
2,A new twist on a cool oldie,Nice change compared to the original. Excellent beat. Would be better with a real voice singing.
4,Classic fighter for SNES,If you enjoy fighters and like Marvel Comics you'll love this. It's similar to Maximum Carnage but it's two player. Pretty fast paced. I beat it fairly quick with a friend. The replay factor is pretty high too.
1,LARGE PRINT BIBLE!,"Purchased thru Amazon.com, I ordered a LARGE PRINT Bible and I feel very inconvenienced having to go through the process of returning this Bible. When I received the Bible it had normal size print and a large margin...not what I ordered! I ordered LARGE PRINT!!! I spent a considerable amount of time looking online for this Bible...and to have received it with normal size print, which I can't see, is unacceptable!When ordering in the future I will make other arrangements! Thank you!!!"
5,"bible, best translation",Experts have thoroughly used the most appropriate words in researching the original Greek and Hebrew originally were written.This version is frequently called the best translation.
4,almost everything,"does have:margin is about three times as wide as a normal margin. so still not big enough to write on the side, but the bottom and top of the page have Plenty of room for notes with the bigger margin.paper doesn't bleed through when using a regular ball point pen. also not onion-skin thin. thin, but durable.font size seems to be about 1 point bigger than the biggest font size in my two other Bibles, so bigger but not giant.different binding, lays flat when open.lifetime warranty according to the back cover.does not have:red letters of Jesusannotations for Old Testament references in the New Testament.warranty information in the Bible or packaging. haven't checked the manufacturer's website though."
1,Missed Expectations,"Having previously read Bernard Fall's book, ""Hell In a Very Small Place"", and recently, Martin Windrow's wonderful account of this battle in ""The Last Valley"", I was hoping that this DVD would allow me to get a visualization of those accounts, in a tactical sequence of events, perhaps associated with maps. For instance, I was hoping to see some of the strongholds and accompanying footage of the associated engagements. There is very little of this and in fact the majority of the DVD focuses on the political aspects of the conflict. I think my expectations were to high with regard to the availability of filmed resource. For the most part, a lot of the battle footage appears to be shot from a Russian perspective, collocated with the Viet Minh. The only way that the terrain is viewed is from a sweeping view of the valley. There is a complete lack of tactical flow. I was very disappointed and ended up by throwing the DVD in the trash."
4,An excellent resource for students,"I had to respond to Mr. Garnero's review. Yes, the film, at an hour long, is very short on tactical details, but it is strong on the politics and strategic thinking surrounding an important battle that is given short shrift in American history classrooms. I would highly recommend this film for those classrooms as the perfect introduction to any discussion about the Second Indochina War (America's Vietnam). And the next time, dear reader, you are disappointed with something that has educational value, please consider contributing to your local library, instead of the dump."
2,dvd's,"Disappointed. This dvd seems more French bashing than history. The space dedicated to the Vietnamese is also small and stay in the ""coolie yellow men ability category"". Few time dedicated to strategies and history and depiction of the Vietnamese towering figures like Ho Chi Minh and Giap."
4,How funky is your chicken?,"Spasm jazz in the best sense of the term, coming to grand fruition in concert. Eminently danceable tunes from this Vermont collective. 'Lap Hen' is living prook of just how funky humans can be in the post-bop world. Talented musicians having fun in the most natural setting."
4,Pretty Good DVD and CD,I like this set because it offers a behind the scenes DVD and a mixtape-like CD with cuts that you won't get off any album. Its enjoyable for all Mobb fans. Recommended!
4,Good Enough,"The reason why I say this is good enough because, it comes with a CD that has exclusive tracks that are fire; like track(s) #3-Clap Me, #8-Gun Sling, #16-Taste This, #18-I Want You, and my favorite #11-Three Stories. The DVD starts off as if it were going to be a movie but, turns into a documentary. Okay!"
4,M.O.B.B,"this is a good dvd/cd. since when was the last time mobb deep released a wack mixtape? i cant think of anything and you probably cant either. bottom line is this: cd is good and kinda brings you back to the murda musik days thats what the tracks sort of remind me of. production on it is fair (even though on the last track they used a 50 cent beat and sort of bit the hook but hey its a mixtape and the song was good anyway. i think on some tracks they used other ziggins beats to but i cant remember them off da top, maybe they didnt i dunno) and lyrics and flows r gangsta as usual.dvd is fun to watch, but some scenes take patience to be enjoyable.overall a good buy."
4,"Juicy, but loses steam.","Max Phillips writes beautifully. He knows how to describe feelings, sights, and smells so that the reader is right there with him. He will take you on a ride of obsession with a crazy woman. But at times you might feel like: why is he still harboring on this girl? She's unlikeable. She's inconsiderate, an alcoholic, and unreliable. She's a flirt, but she's ma"
3,"Great Show, Flawed DVD","Bobobo has been one of my favorite anime for a while and I'm glad to see that it's finally getting an unedited DVD release. It's not for everyone but if you like extremely weird, wacky, and random humor Bobobo is for you.Now about the DVD itself. First the good news, it's unedited, has good video quality, and the english dub, while heavily localized in spots, is very good. Unfortunately, the lack of proper subtitles to accompnay the Japanese language track is a huge problem. Instead we just get the closed captioning text for the English version. Plus, they don't even stay on the screen long enough for anyone except a speed reader. These problems, and a few other more minor flaws knocked two stars off my rating.If you don't mind sticking to the English dub or can speak Japanese the problems won't bother you too much. And, short of imports or illegal downloads this is the only way to get your hands on an excellent show."
3,Bobobo-Bo Bo-Bobo: Bo-nafide Protector,The video is good but the sub-titles are timed so briefly that we cannot read them. This is a gift for a hearing-impaired individual so it is challenging to watch it when she cannot read much of what the sub-titles say. I watched it with her and I could not read them and I am a fast reader.
4,very crazy xD,"i first saw this show as a kid on toonami it was so funny, weird, and wacky!! also when i heard that it came on dvd i was so exited, this dvd was great and came in awesome condition! 4/5 i would give this because the japanese subs werent right:( also i wonder why illumitoon stopped making these dvds:("
2,Agreeing with previous reviewers,"The subtitles that are in this DVD are those for the english script. Which, unless you speak Japanese, you're not going to understand anything in the original Japanese dub. However the 2nd DVD to be released DOES have subtitles that match up to the original Japanese script."
4,DVD,"I love this DVD because it has japanese, japanese with english subtitles, and dubbed english. At first the menu is a bit unorganized but it was not an inconvienience. I do not think the english subtitles for the japanese moved too fast. The dvd came with a hologram cover thing that peels of so I put it in my locker. :)"
1,Bobobobo bobo is pure randomness,"This series is pure randomness. I don't know whether this is supposed to be a parody or comedy anime. Though I don't think that matters because either way you slice the bacon Bobobobo bobo fails as either a comedy or parody.Say it with me people randomness doesn't always equal a successful comedy or parody!Predictably the anime purists cry watch it in Japanese the Japanese version is better.I doubt it!This series is so nonsensical that you don't even need talented actors or screenwriters to adapt this series. As far as I can tell this show is just one big ad-lib only not nearly as funny and enduring as White Chicks, Airplane and Monty Python's Holy Grail."
5,The Best Breath of Fire to date.,"Now people however Bof3 got a better review is beyond me. Breath of Fire 2 is on par with Final fantasy 3!!! This game is definitley worth buying and playing over and over. The translation I don't really notice as being so bad. The Lod thing I didn't notice. The story is not that badly translated. In closing, if you can't choose between 1 2 3 and 4 get 2."
4,Taking the Law outside of the Big-Meg,"After enjoying Bad Moon Rising, I decided to pick up a few of these novels. This adventure is an exciting romp across the Black Atlantic, exploring new territory that has barely been touched upon in the 2000AD comics.Dredd came across perfectly this time, in his gruff, no-nonsense manner. The story fit well with the lore of Judge Dredd and the characters were distinct and consistent.This is mostly set outside of Mega-City One, but Dredd still manages the impossible in the name of the law, and he explores brand new areas of the bizarre future world.A very enjoyable read that I honestly recommend to all Judge Dredd fans, and even those that are not fans, but enjoy a good adventure/investigation."
5,Delta Does It Again,"We decided to remodel our bathroom. We had brass fixtures and decided to go with brushed stainlesss. We have always had single handle faucets, so that was a no-brainer. Every person at Lowes, our contractor, etc. all said to buy Delta. We looked on line and found that the best prices and the exact style we wanted could be had so much cheaper than through Amazon than from any other source. Lowes had to install them because our new cabinets came from there. They noted that one connection piece was too short (sorry for lack of technical terms) but I had already read about that on other reviews. The faucet operation is smooth and the water flow is perfect. We are glad that we took the plunge with Delta."
3,Very Short Hoses,I installed this in a rather standard bathroom. The hoses come pre-plumbed from the factory and cannot be replaced with standard hardware store hoses. They are very short and I had to redo the wall plumbing so the faucet hoses would reach. I would have returned it but I sent it to my dad's house to replace his while I was visiting across country.
5,very nice book just what I wanted,I really enjoyed this book just what I wanted and all of my friends have enjoyed it also.
5,THIS WORKS,"I HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS BOOK FOR ALL CLINICIANS AND PATIENTS. CLINICIANS LEARN THIS IF YOU ARE NOT ALREADY DOING THIS. I HAVE BEEN CLIENT CENTERED AND FOLLOW SIMILAR GUIDELINES, CLIENTS CAN READ THIS AND TELL THERE CLINICIANS HOW THEY PREFER RECOVERY OUTCOMES"
4,Required Reading,"....if you are into Crystal and want further indepth information, this is the book to have in your arsnal. Easy, qick informative read!! Excellent for quick references."
1,does not touch her new material,"Roni Griffith has just come out with her new release ""Only You""Its Great!!!!! [...]She has come back so much stronger. Check it out. Evie"
3,TWO TERRIFIC DANCE CLASSICS DROWNING IN 80'S SYNTH FILLER...,"... Roni Griffith, you were such a sexy babe back in '82, where are you now? ""Love Is The Drug"" and ""Desire"" are absolutely top-notch 80's dance classics... the rest is bubble-headed bimbo fluff."
4,electorodisco classic,"Electrodisco classic music. It is not bad, but there is not the music that I excelled in especially."
5,Roni Griffith beats Kim Wilde.,"I found out about Roni when I heard ""Desire"" a couple of years ago. She somewaht sounds like Kim Wilde, but Kim Wilde never made it out of ""Kids In America."" I thought Roni was in the group The Flirts. I knew, however, that the singer of the song had a much more sensuous voice than that of the Flirts. Then I heard ""The Best part of Breaking up"" and I was hooked. The songs in this album are truly 80's jewels. ""Your love is the drug,"" ""Take me out"" are just hypnotizing. As for her new religious material, I don't care about it much. Another of her best material is ""Hot Lover,"" ""Heart on the Line"" and ""Spyes"". Check this cd out, you wont regret it."
1,The Blue Book is now a CD,The CD opens in a web browser (I really thought we'd ordered a book!) and has less information than what we could find on an internet page. The only information of value is a link to the a website of that resort (which we already had).Don't bother. I'm returning ours.
5,Clear and succinct,"I found this book because I wanted to learn Squeak (a dialect of SmallTalk) and I bought it because it rated so high on Amazon.com. This is the best technical book I have ever read. It is clear and succinct. Its IBM SmallTalk examples ran fine on Squeak (GUI component examples excepted) and its clear style made me understand a lot of concepts that were taught to me years ago, but that I never really understood until now."
1,Don't Buy This Book!,"This book is poorly put together. There are several typos and it is not at all helpful. I wouldn't pay more than 4 or 5 dollars for this book. Find a different publisher, not XAM!"
1,A joke of a publication,"I could not believe that this book was actually published. Compared to the official website examples for the test, this book would never prepare you for the Cset Spanish test. The book is highly overpriced."
2,Not very fun,"I bought this game for my son and its not very fun, even for super nintendo. Too hard to get anywhere without cheating"
3,Toy Story Nes Supernintendo,"It is a fun game, a little time consuming, redundant, and not very many options for controls or features. Of course its a game that my kids will enjoy when they are about 10, so I wouldn't expect an adult to be too amazed by it."
4,Superb Reading About Forgiveness,"The author has done a scholarly work that is quite readable and shares a number of case studies about the importance and process of forgiveness. He dispells a number of myths which surround the subject. The overarching theme of forgiveness is emphasized because ultimatly the forgivness extended benefits the offender, but even more, the one who has been hurt. Have no regrets in your relationships."
4,Provides a good workout!,"I've been a member of a gym for years, and have only used really high end ellipticals. This feels different than a professional elliptical. It took a little getting used to...but once I did it was fine. It provides a great workout and the convenience is great! I would recommend this product."
4,Vary good,It's like evry ather Harvest moon game.Thar are some things that are diffrent about it.The graphics are diffrent like old nes graphics.I one ever Harvest Moon game that has came out in us and this one is one of the better harvest games.This game has more up's than dawn's.
5,Disco Heaven,I'm so old I remember dancing to the original versions in the early 80s and have it on vinyl. Sounds awesome on CD!
5,Perfect,"This product does the job like it is suppose to. I personally needed one of these things because I was missing one for my tripod. Bought it, shipped to my house, and tried it on. It fits perfectly on my Velbon Videomate 607. Does exactly what it's suppose to do, screw your camera onto a tripod. The cork on top also helps keep the camera snug and put. I thought this cork would look weird on the tripod but it looks perfectly fine once its on. Definitely recommend this if you need one (or are missing one) for your tripod."
4,Works Great,Works good as it should. Functions as you would expect at this price point. I would buy again if needed.
1,The question is hard,The question is very hard you have to be educated to play this game. It gives you ten seconds to read the question and 1 minutes to write down the answer.The up and down button doesn't move very well. To place a bet you have to careful push the start button or you can lose your bet without typing your question. I like the newer games that give you multiply choice.
3,Mediocrity from Frank Black??!?!? Believe It,"I was disappointed with this album. As a huge fan of his work with the pixies (all 10 star albums, on a scale of 1-5) and more recently of his work with the catholics I couldn't believe this when I heard it. It's not that this album is bad, I would gladly listen to this over any radio airplay/MTV crap, but I would rather listen to any other album associated with Frank Black than this. The problem is that he sounds like he ran out of his normal brilliant ideas for this album and gave us one anyway. Granted some songs are good (Punk Rock City, Jesus Was Right, Men In Black) but some are plain stupid and sophmoric (kicked in the taco). I can only reccomend this to Frank Black fanatics (of which I am one), but I think anyone else will be even more disappointed than I was"
2,A Step Down,"With a few exceptions on the album, ""Cult"" feels like a lazy composition that relies too much on quirky lyrics. This could be a disappointment to Frank Black fans expecting a continuation of quality and fervor generated in Black's first two solo albums."
1,It's A Shame About Ray,"As you may guess from the title, Black is a cult favorite. After leaving critical darlings The Pixies Black set out to pursue his dreams of weirdness on his own. He's an artist only a critic could love, his music is dissonant and difficult, his vocals are at best annoying and his lyrics are bizarre. Probably will be liked by Indie fans, if that sounds like your cup o tea, BUY. Otherwise, SELL. That's what I did."
2,Woefully disappointing,Just not on the level with his first two solo post-Pixies efforts. I couldn't find anything I liked about it. The Cult of Ray is rotting in the depths of my catalogue.
2,Problem in the quality control dept,"Some good tracks such as Marsist and The Men In Black (very Trompe Le Monde Pixies) but the album is crippled by inferior tracks such as Cult of Ray and Creature Crawling, which sound like songs looking for a melody.After the first two amazing albums this unfortunately where the cracks started to show.""I don't want to hurt you"" is a pleasant but plodding ballad that showed the signs of the tepid songwwriting that followed on albums like Honeycomb.Oh well I still love Frank !"
4,"Frank's ""Rubber Soul"" . . .","but without the stringy guitar love sounds. He diverges from his previous solo work. This is probably why many of the ""not his best"" reviewers said such. CoR takes us to and from Mars, plus all over our own planet. Granted we still hear Frank's loudness and slowed down heavy bass/drum beats. But the mystic interplanetary theme is just too unusual, even for him. Maybe this is why CoR is my second favorite of his solo/Catholic recordings. The most Martian instrumental ""Adventure and Resolution"", the painful-aimless-catchy ""Kicked in the Taco"" and the double-oriented face poster contribute to an unordinary but enjoyable experience. Do not buy if you're not willing to let your mind roam or if you're seeking typical tunes. But astronomers and connoisseurs of unusual music should enjoy listening to CoR. Not five starts only due to inferiority to ""Teenager"", but this far-out recording receives my stamp of approval."
2,anticlimactic,"I remember buying this album the day it came out. I had loved the Pixies and really enjoyed Frank's first two solo albums. I knew this was going to be a masterpiece along the lines of Dolittle or Surfer Rosa. Damn was I wrong. I haven't been this let down by an album since...well Bossanova, probably. All of the wild experimentation and genre-shifting was gone. What was left was mediocre bar rock. Only ""The Creature Crawling"" and ""The Last Stand of Shazeb Andleeb"" really stand out as classics. The two instrumentals are completely unnecessary. Frank seems to value a gravely-voiced style of delivery in place or his spectacular falsetto. It's a shame, really. The album serves only as a reminder of how great he once was. He later partially redeemed himself with Dog in the Sand and parts of Pistolero, but this album remains where it all went terribly awry."
3,2nd Merrick mystery isn't quite as good...,"Mary Jo Adamson manages to tell an entertaining story in her ""Elusive Voice"" about a suspictious death of a Harvard professor, and the Spiritualist seance at which it happened. Michael Merrick, a skeptic and recupating police reporter, is asked to look into the mystery and into Syvlie, the medium at the seance. Adamson wrecks the contuinity of the story by making this story set in the early 1870's, while refercing the first, which seemed to have been set in the 1840's. This is one reason why I couldn't rate this as good as the first book. Merrick eventually does uncover the death as a murder, as he tries to protect Sylvie from danger, and solve the mystery. Interesting twist at the end, as we discover who the ""Spirit Killer"" is. It does capture the early 1870s well, and I did like what Adamson had to say, so I will give this 3 stars, and recommend it."
4,"Great, rocks out.","Having seen Bruce in concert with and without the E-Street Band, this tape is the cloest available video media to the type of non-E-Street concerts he's been performing over the past few years. Great rendition of ""Red Headed Woman""."
1,Terrible service.,"I placed order on June 16th considering the fact that this item is ""In stock. Processing takes an additional 2 to 3 days.""Just today (7 days!!!!!) ""June 23, 2009 Shipment has left seller facility and is in transit.""I think it is absolutely inappropriate to mislead buyers..."
1,Large Drawstring Backpack,The first day my son used this string bag it ripped right down the whole front of it. I bought the same bag last year for school and it was much stronger and lasted months before it started to show signs of heavy wear and tear.
4,Great Bag!,I was pleasantly surprised with this bag and the quality of the materials. It really holds quite a bit and that's great--one less bag to carry! Very pleased with my purchase and have had several friends ask where I got it. They were shocked to find out where and for what price. Great purchase!
5,Works perfect,This is apparently the 'in' backpack in my child's middle school at the moment. He finds the size of this one to be a little large -- but the price is right and you can actually get a couple in different colors. It's not at all bulky and will fit well in a child's locker and it seems fairly sturdy. he's been using his for a couple of months with no breakage so far.
2,Not Very Helpful....Oversold,"I purchased this book among others prior to my recent trip to the ""Big Apple"". I found this book full of rather impractical and unuseable ideas and really a ""come on"". Wouldn't recommend it. Other guides were much more helpful. This was a waste of money."
5,excellent purchase,This was a great purchase!! It came in good time. I'm not sure about the content because It was a present for a friend but she hasn't had any complaints so as far as i know excellent!!
2,Not for Me!,"Didn't care for this book, not the information I was looking for about cheap things in NYC."
4,Pretty Good Even For Tourist Purposes,*Very* glad I came across this little treasure - will be using it during my upcoming trips to New York. Appears to be *quite* helpful. (Also just buy a good used copy).
2,"Useful in parts, outdated phone numbers","I do not think I have ever returned a book after I bought it (grad school books don't fall in this category). But sadly, I had to return this book to Barnes and Nobel a week after I bought this particular book. The mistake was mine. I did not check to see when it was printed. The copy that I bought for close to $15 in Oct 2006 was printed in 2004...it was 2 years old! No wonder I did not find it useful. For starters, quite a few of the phone numbers were incorrect, and then from there things went downhill for me.Two years ago, this must have been a useful book to have, but today with the Internet, and specifically Google a reader's patience and threshold for incorrect information is very low. And, I clearly fall in that category.If you happen to see it in your local library or a book shop, do browse through it for there are useful nuggets of information to travel and live in the Big Apple."
3,Good Job,"Well done Cheap Bastard!! You could take some of the ideas in this book and do them anywhere!! Some of the things you'd have to actaully live in New York but if you're trying to stick to a budget I'd recommend this book for sure, however...you NEED to plan!! Some things need to be booked at least 2 weeks in advance and if you leave a message be prepared to follow up...give yourself enough time to plan on some of the free tours!!"
4,D'OH!,"This is a great guide for finding entertainment on the cheap. Most of these tips are well-known, while some are not. Personally, I found some of the suggested itineraries not very interesting, but hey, maybe someone else may find them useful. This book does not discuss how you can get the really good stuff like free movie tickets to current hollywood films--it offers tips for other types of films--or free tickets to Carnegie Hall, etc. I guess I have to write my own book :^D"
1,havent got to read it yet and im angry,"I just received my copy of this paperback, and It came packaged with no protection whatsoever! If your a comic collector then you know that its ridiculous receiving a NEW Comic that has a Big crease or wrinkle straight out of the packaging! And its the Sellers responsibility to see to it that whatever was sent WAS sent with responsible packaging,. It should of at least had some kind of thin hard board, and not just an easy bendable bubble wrap envelope thats surely to arrive to the consumers door damaged! Its like ordering bad food, -would you still want to eat it?- maybe if your hungry enough, but it certainly wont be enjoyable! ""DO NOT ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE UNLESS YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT DAMAGED GOODS"""
3,"Old Game, Good Playing","This game is similiar to a role playing game, but is more geared for the younger crowd. It also is like zelda in some aspects as it has that ""platformer"" game experience. It has a corny story line, but I played this a long time ago and remember how fun it was. If you are nostalgic for old SNES games, I reccomend purchasing this one."
4,Very promising,"This was great!Certainly takes a chance by exploring dark themes along the lines of Edgar Allen Poe, and it feels nice not to be mollycoddled and spared from such disturbing ideas as it just intensifies the eroticism.I find it good that the author uses cold language occasionally, it serves to keep you slightly distant from the action so you get drawn in even more to the scorching encounters between Nik and Elizabeth.The undercurrents that lie between the family and friends are captivating. Surely, this book works so well because it is shaped by it's characters, not what happens to them. Far above many other paranormal romances, you shouldn't regret spending your well-earned bucks."
2,High hopes dashed...,"I had such high hopes for this book, as it combined elements of all my favourite genres: gothic, paranormal and historical romance. My hopes were dashed, however, early on. The heroine, Elizabeth doesn't seem to have read the Heroine Guidebook, which clearly states that gothic heroines must be somewhat retiring (even if it's a facade), reluctant to be seduced (even if they really want to be), willing to entertain the possibility of the supernatural (even if it is against her will), and able to put two clues together (even if she comes up with the wrong answer).I plodded my way through page after page, trying hard to like this book. Even the sex scenes didn't make the going any easier. (And these were very detailed, which can seem odd when phrases like ""delirium of sensual delight"" are the norm.) Though not a total waste of time, this book is not a keeper, either; it will be passed on and quickly forgotten."
3,Not for hard-core play,"You get what you pay for. I wanted a cheap pad to play DDR on as a workout. I'm not very good at the game, so this pad is okay for my needs. However, if you plan on playing on the higher difficulties, DO NOT ORDER THIS! My fiance is a hardcore DDRer and the pad slips around really badly. The up arrow is very touchy, so it misses at least half the time when you're going really fast. You can tell the pad is really cheaply made. It's very sticky and the edges tend to roll up. The hilarious Engrish in the manual was enjoyable, though."
2,Buy Konami pad instead,"This pad is a cheap knockoff of the pad which comes bundled with the game. It's much worse. The game itself is great- but this pad, and it's horrifically written instructions are not worth your time. The pad slips, buttons are unresponsive, and the material is cheap. Just get konami's version instead."
2,"Bad Smeel, Bad Connector... Bad Quality","This Dance Pad smells like pipeline glue.my dance pad came with one of the connection pins twisted i had to fix it myself because it didnt work when connected to ps2.it works ok but the quality is very low, u better buy the official one this one is not worthy."
5,Dancing down the house,I purchased this replacement PS2 non slip Dance Pad for my girls because they wore out the original one! The first replacement pad didn't work correctly but Amazon replaced it and the new one works perfectly! The girls love it and it gets them some exercise and they really enjoy it!
1,Cheap and Cracked,"I order these online because it's almost impossible to find DDR mats in stores. They arrived in plastic bags inside the Amazon box not in any product packaging. This may have been why one was cracked in a number of areas (along where it had been folded for packaging) and the other had small rips in the same areas. I must say that the return process was Very simple. I was dreading the process, but I just had to print out a mail label from home, tape it onto the Amazon box and include the shipping receipt that came in the box and then take it to the P.O. I was refunded in less than a week as well. Good Amazon, bad mat."
1,PS2 Dance Pad Non-Slip,"The description on this product is incorrect. I used the four non slip stickers on the bottom of the pad and the pad still slipped around on the floor. To top it off, it was not functioning right. I would not recommend this product."
1,"Don't buy, came in broken","I decided to buy this dance pad though Amazon.com authorizes sellers because i though it would not come broken, but I was! So don;t buy because even though it says ""new conditions"", it's probably broken."
1,Don't order from them!!,"I waited a month for this dance mat to come. It never came. When I emailed the company, they said that they had shipped it two weeks ago. They did not have a tracking number and did not have another dance mat to send me. Supposedly my money is being refunded through Amazon, but i have not heard anything more about it. My advice, do not order from this company."
1,Doesn't Work,"Received it in the right amount of time and in good packaging. But opening it up and plugging it in with my game I find that it doesn't work in the slightest bit. It isn't slow to respond, it looks perfectly fine, but it doesn't work at all. Not even slowly.I've checked to make sure it's not the DDR game and plugged in my controller which scrolls through the game and such things just fine. It is the pad that is the problem.There is no reason it shouldn't work, but it doesn't.Simply; Doesn't work, don't get it."
1,Do these mats work with a PS2 or not?,"I pull out the mats only to find a USB plug at the end of the cords. I plugged them into the PS2 and nothing happened. Did I miss something? I googled this mat and it only showed videos of people using this for PC use but yet when I looked at what platform this product is for it said PS2. It did come with a CD but my PS2 didn't recognize it and my laptop nearly froze trying to read the CD and then it couldn't extract the files when it finally did open. If anyone can help me fix this problem I would be greatly appreciative because I bought two of these mats and checked the mail everyday and until I got them... so you can assume I am RAGING right now. I planned on using this with my PS2 for DDR Extreme, Extreme 2, Max 2 and Supernova 2"
3,DDR,"My sister and I had been looking for this product because they no longer sell it in the game stores in our area. We found this one for a reasonable price. The only issue we have sometimes with this is that they arrows when pressed don't allow you to complete the current song because nothing happens, I think it may be the type of material because the other mat that we have doesn't have this same material and we have had no issues with it."
2,DDR pad,"Product came on time and looked new, however it was folded up so tightly into such a small box that apparently the wiring got pushed around within the pad. As a result the top arrow on the pad only senses your step about 30% of the time. The game itself is a blast, but we were very disappointed that the pad doesn't work correctly."
3,Loaded with information,"Impeccably sourced, this book provides insight not only on the history, but the culture and civic institutions too. Starting with Visigothic Spain, the book plows through a 1000 years of Spanish history. A tough read for pleasure, but as a research tool it is magnificent"
1,Inadequate,"O'Callaghan's history of the Iberian peninsula, though exhausting in its detail, falls prey to typical western biases and employes the fallacious traditional historiography of Iberia, emphasizing the ""Re""-Conquest and a supposed ""move towards unity."" This approach is woefully inadequate for understanding the events of Medieval Iberial, and fosters an unfair appraisal of the Muslim culture that flourished there for centuries. Additionally, O'Callaghan has managed to, through his exceedingly dry prose, completely emasculate this otherwise exciting and vibrant subject. In all my years as a history student, I have never read another text from which I retained so little; my classmates concur on the matter. Therefore, I wholeheartedly denounce this text."
2,Battery Life is poor,"I got this for christmas this year. The software is easy enough and doesn't really need anything else. I don't see how anyone could use this as an actual keychain though because the exterior gets incredibly scratched up from your jeys and looks terrible, they need a leather case or something. Also, I am no longer able to charge the battery. I left it charging for 10 hours or so and once I unplug it all I get is a quick flash and then it shuts off. Anyone know of any replacement batteries? I've hardly used this one, I showed it to about 5 people for about 7 minutes total viewing time and its dead already?"
5,Lenten meditations,"""Were You There?: Stations of the Cross,"" set in an African village, is a book of insightful Lenten meditations by theologian Diana L. Hayes. Accompanying the prayers and reflections are paintings by Tanzanian artist Charles S. Ndege who incorportates typical scenes along the shores of Lake Victoria to add impact to his powerful images. Impressive work. Marcia Maguire, UMC church librarian"
4,At Last a Contemporary Commentary!,"I was asked to lead a mediation on the Stations for 20 Episcopal church women. In my research I found only one other female source. The ""other"" was archaic as all get out. Diana is fresh, totally in touch with today's world, women's needs and strengths! The illustrations were a powerful accompaniment."
2,Terrible sound quality.,"These were remastered from the records, not the master tapes.The sound is terrible, everything has a strange ""tinny""quality, and some of them have an excruciating amountof echo. I give it 2 stars because there's some songs herethat aren't available anywhere else, specifically the Fordduets, and a number of obscure Capitol singles. But the soundquality is a lot to overcome. Really, a cassette of theoriginal records would sound better."
5,Operation Takeover Accomplished!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was the original Cd that came out in 1996. I bought it at Showtime Music in Fillmoe. It is a classic for those who bumped the GLP at the time. It is still pretty damn tight. It has the laid back rhythms as well as the ""Mobb"" beats. This was one of the first times Messy Marv hooked up on a GLP album. The rest is Bay Area Rap history. Also, check out the Gamblaz song ""Filthy Surroundings"".... still one of my favorites. So if you like San Quinn, JT the Bigga Figga, Messy Marv, The Gamblaz, Playa P......you should definitely get this CD....if you can find it.....if not just get the newer version."
3,Poor Rebate Policy,The product itself is fine the rebate process is a pain. It required proof of purch from each container. I don't always use the oil right away so not even sure if I will be able to get rebate.
4,"Just because you're paranoid , doesn't mean nobody is out to get you.","Conspiracy Theory DVDThis movie reminds me of Bird on a Wire where Goldie Hawn is the lead female, a lawyer, here it is a red-headed Julia Roberts playing a Justice Department lawyer with Mel Gibson being chased by Agents.Bird on a Wire was made in 1990Conspiracy Theory made in 1997.Short memory.Just because you're paranoid , doesn't mean nobody is out to get you.I enjoyed both films.Recommended for fans of Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts.Gunner February, 2008"
5,Good Decisions Require Good Communication,"Kudos to Bennett & Gibson for a well written, understandable book with eye opening ways of problem solving. As they point out, ""Do not squander the power of a good decision by failing to communicate well"". In looking back at my working days as a problem solver and developer of standards, rules, regulations, policies and procedures, this model would have been invaluable. It will now assist me in making personal decisions as a retiree."
5,A Field Guide to Good Decisions: Values in Action,I was looking for material that would help me professionally in the area of ethics committee decision making. This book filled that expectation and then some. It moved decision making into the wholistic realm. The material presented is applicable to the professional life as well as personal decision making. The material is presented in a concise yet thorough manner and in an easily understood method. I definitely recommend this book.
5,Perfect Jigger,The perfect jigger for making cocktails. Better weighted and more durable than the plastic version. You won't remember what you used before...
3,1) less precise than plastic; 2) scale markings are somewhat dim,"1) Because it's opaque, the only way to read a measurement on this cup is by the scale on cup's interior. By contrast, the plastic version of the mini-angle cup (which I also own), can be read from an interior scale, or an exterior scale on its exterior, through its transparent plastic.The interior scale of both the metal and plastic versions can be difficult to read accurately because it must be read while held below eye level, resulting in parallax. But the exterior scale of the plastic version allows reading a measurement with the cup held at eye-level, which averts parallax, and consequently yields a more precise reading.2) The scale markings appear dark grey, not black. The scale markings could even be described as faded-looking, although my two cups are new."
2,"Good product, bad description","Nowhere in the description does it say that this only has a 2-ounce capacity; the description says ""cup"", but it is not a cup, it is a 1/4-cup."
2,Far less useful without a metric scale,"This is a sturdy, thoughtfully desigend measuring cup, but it is marked with two scales: tablespoons and fluid ounces. Since one ounce is two tablespoons, that is not useful. The metric scale, used by 95% of the world, is left off completely. Unless you plan to use this along with a calculator, buy the plastic version instead; that one is correctly marked with ounces and milliliters."
1,Terrible Design,"1) Rust: after a few months of owning it, I have to scrub off the rust spots every other time I wash it.2) Stickers: I still haven't been able to remove the labels.3) Markings: hard to see when measuring anything other than water.Don't bother."
3,Three and a half stars.,"I use this for measuring cocktail ingredients. I also have the same product in clear plastic. It's much easier to read the measurements on the plastic one in low light, however, I prefer the look and feel of the stainless steel. Hopefully Oxo will make a third model made of glass someday."
3,Not as good as expected,Purchased this along with the 2 cup version and the same thing applies: Measurement markings are too faint and barely visible from some viewing angles.
3,"Glad, but not happy","I love the half gallon size, it's perfect for me. This is the second one I've owned, but the lid on this one leaks constantly whenever taking a drink. I've got the perfect jug, but you get wet whenever you take a drink! I've no complaints all about the jug itself!"
1,Disappointed,"This jug leaked from the day we purchased it. I was very disappointed in this item. The best part was the insulated jacket it comes in.The opening should be larger to accomodate ice cubes without a struggle. I sent back and did not reorder. I accept the fact that this may have been a reject and that others may not leak, but overall I was unhappy with the plastic jug, but liked the insulated jacket."
1,jugs,"I am very disappointed in the quality of the this product. I have had 3 jugs in the past which I bought at a sporting good store which I have enjoyed for 6 years. The quality of the jugs are cheap and the plastic are much thinner. What a shame this was my favorite jug. I am president of a ladies tennis club and I had suggested that we order 200 of these for our women tennis players, the board gave me the go ahead to order. But I have decided that it was not worth it. So I won't be ordering this product again.Marie nations"
3,Jugs,"I have owned this product before. The new ones the inside doesn't fit tight and the spout is easily knocked out of alignment. I always insert a small straw so I can drink out of it easiler, and the new ones have to small oF an opening to do this. I am an older lady ad hate holding the jug up so i can get a drink out of it. Thanks for hearing what I had to say."
3,2 Out of 3 is Just So So,I ordered 3 of these jugs. 2 were fine & 1 has a defective spout that leaks.
2,Very expensive and my hair still went to the red side :(,Not as great as you would expects as I love Bumble products. My brown hair still went to the reddish side and i was NOT too happy :(
5,"Great purchase, great price",The book was in excellent condition and arrived quickly. The price was reasonable and affordable based on price comparisons. I am very pleased with this item.
3,Good for young girls.,"This is a game for girls age 5 - 8 pretty much, because it is very easy for everyone else. This is a bunch of matching games really. The game first starts off, as Barbie thinks of her first apointment, then you go driving off in your corvette to the appointment. You get there, then you must match Barbie's clothing and color to a magazine cover that is shown to you briefly. Then another car ride to Barbie's arobix, which is pushing a different button combination, like Y, down, Y, left, X, up, X up. Yada Yada, basically helping girls improve their memory with Barbie as the teacher."
1,Incomplete..........,"Be very careful if you order this item, as mine did not have the rack and cable in the box. Called amazon and was told that it was not in stock, so why ship it!"
4,great product tricky install,Nice product once it was in... the steering is very smooth. It was a very tight fit under the dash and difficult pairing the steering column with cable system. On scale of 1-10 on funess I give this one an 8... Hard install.
2,Not what I expected,"So I just got these in the mail and I must say that I am disappointed. The first issue is that these glasses are quite a bit bigger than they appear in the picture. I don't have a very large face, so they really don't look that great. So if you are like me and have a face that's on the small side then beware.The second issue is that these glasses feel rather cheap, more akin to something that you would buy at Target for $25. There is just no sense that this is a $60 brand name item or most definitely not the $99 claimed retail. Of course it remains to be seen how they will hold up after several months/years of use, but my prediction based on the quality and sturdiness of the frame that it will be more like months rather than years.On the small plus side, they are polarized; if you have a large face, they probably wont look terrible; and they do come with a neat little carrying case.All in all, I am disappointed with this purchase and will probably just use them only for driving."
3,NO LONGER AVAILABLE,"Just wanted to let everyone know that Phillips has discontinued this Model Intelliclen system electronic toothbrush. They no longer have any supplies for the toothbrush nor can you find any in the stores, except maybe replacement heads. The warehouse clubs are selling Phillips and the replacement heads for the newer models but NO toothpaste. So beware before you buy any of these products unless you make sure you can purchase the toothpaste replacement. So, grab them now through Amazonbut beware most expire next year. Don't know what happens after the expiration date. I could only purchase a year's worth not knowing."
1,This is a ripoff!,"Don't think of purchasing this item, unless you enjoy being ripped-off. The Sonic Intelliclean system works well. However the manufacturer has abandoned the product and is no longer producing the replacement head tooth brushes. They are currently available at a cost of $99.95 for a package of two, four times the previous price.Although the tooth paste tubes are a cute gimmick, you get excellent results by just applying your own toothpaste to the bruch.Might as well look at another manufacturer's product line."
2,Toothpaste,it's fine but for the price I can buy 3 large tubes of toothpaste. will go back to doing that to save money.
3,Disappointed about no longer available,I have a son with a disability. This was the perfect toothbrush/toothpaste combination we have found. Now it is no longer available. Not sure what to get to replace it. More toothpaste in the sink and not in the mouth I guess.
4,HD aquarium on TV,"I wish it was better,,, its ok, but it could have been better.The fishes are small, and the natural sound is a bit exaggerated.Music could have been better.but its a great view after all, pretty relaxing,, Kids are crazy about it!"
5,Better than other aquarium blu-ray that costs more.,"If you expect anything more than a couple of aquariums stationary shot you probably should Go to iMax.If you goal is to make your TV appearance of coral aquarium ""fish tank"" then this is very good. We play this all day on a 42"" LCD in our wait area and everybody is always commenting about it. Your eyes are glued. The fish are relaxing and colorful. The music is good but we just play the sound of the filter.I'm not expert on fish or on blu-ray but I'm very satisfied with price and quality of product. Shipment was fast too."
2,concept is very good,"received the dvd promptly, and thoroughly enjoyed was little i was able to view on my BR DVD player. regrettably, the recording was very unstable and sporadically ""locked up"" during play-back; this occured for all three (3) fish tank themes or ""scenes"", so i will have to return the dvd.clarity of recording is quite good. realism can be improved by hiding any/all man-made features of the aquarium. for example, the return-flow turbine in the upper left corner of the screen should be hidden during recording. Also, ""cropping"" can be improved a bit. for example, location of the ""free-surface"" of the acquarium could be deduced with ease. also, the water flow/interference wave pattern formed by the aquarium is easily seen in one of the scenes (scene 3)."
4,It gives your TV the look of a colorful aquarium.,"Like some other reviews I got these as part of a bundle promotion.I don't know much about fish or coral. I'm a graphic designer. The fish on this disc look sharp and vibrant, and while it's not 3D (somebody should make one!), it gives you the feeling that you are looking at a tank full of fish. You can see very fine details.I would have given 5 stars if the disc also included information about the fish and maybe some instructions for people who are new to blue ray. As it stands, it's very pretty eye (and ear) candy, which aptly fits the product description. The whole set of discs was very relaxing. If you have problems looping or turning off the music you just need to use the pop up menu button on the remote."
2,Skip it,The quality is not that of an HD irrespective of what camera they used. The bright areas are burnt out. If you adjust your TV's brightness the dark areas become really dark. I may still play this disc during a party but am not thrilled with the quality.Will like to appreciate the offer from the producer/cinematographer to refund the cost of this purchase but the cost of shipping it back is more than the cost of blu ray. And it's too small an amount anyway.My search for a perfect HD aquarium continues...
2,Drab,"Nice try, but not good enough. Colors are drab in some areas and over-exposed in others. There is even one track where a mangy algae-covered background is featured. This really seems homemade, even if it was shot with a Red camera. It doesn't seem like 1080p HD at all."
1,You can do better yourself than this blu ray disk,"This Blu ray disk is not worth the money. Some one just put a camera on a tripot and kept shooting a tank, the same tank. You can do it yourself. You don't need to buy the disk. Very boring. The quality is like a home made one. I wounder why I would have spent nearly $14 on it. For what?"
3,My Bad!,"Evidently I did not read the information close enough for this product when I ordered it. It is a Blue-ray Disc which I do not have a player for. I thought that I could play it on my regular Sony DVD player. The most inexpensive player for this disk is more than I can afford, so my fault. Arba L Lubke (Mr) - 380 Gaviota Pl - Oxnard, CA - 93033"
3,IT'S AS ADVERTIZED. SHIPPED FAST.,IT'S LIKE PUTTING A REAL SALT WATER AQUARIUM ON YOUR TV. I GAVE IT 3 STARS B/C THE FISH MOVE SLOW AND ARE RELAXING AT FIRST. THEN A SCENE POPS UP THAT LOOKS LIKE THEY SPRINKLED CRACK IN THE TANK. NOT RELAXING AT ALL. VIDEO QUALITY WAS VERY GOOD THOUGH.
4,Nice ambiance,"Great color, great scenes. Does not seem as sharp as I would expect but who knows what transcoding was used. In any case worth the few bucks to add some ambiance to the room."
3,Just OK,"Picked this up to be a nice background while showing off the HD TV. I suppose it accomplishes that. We have three different aquarium scenes. The option to continuously loop, so you can put the disc in and forget about it. Each tank has three soundtracks - music and tank sounds, music only, and tank only (tank is a combination of filer and bubble sound). But while it was a nice HD image, the tanks themselves didn't impress me. Rather than a controlled lighting scene like you might see in a store or aquarium. These tanks look lit by sunlight, which caused some problems for me. The first tank is a bit bright, with the top of the image too sun bleached. Another tank has ripples on top, so the sunlight pattern is constantly changing, which I found a bit distracting.It's a decent enough disc, but it wouldn't be my first choice."
2,Just okay,"Seems like they took an HD camera and simply pointed it at a fish tank. HD, yes. Stunning blu-ray colors and clarity. No."
1,Waste of money! Don't buy it!,"These magnet keys are very poorly made and fell apart after just a few hours of use. It is really a case that holds a magnetic ball, but the case opens - easily! Fortunately, I found one of the magnetic balls after it came out of the case, super glued it in the case and super glued the case shut. Might last just long enough for me to order a better product."
3,"Good pass card for cats, but be carefull","I purchased a few of this magnets and my cats are very happy, the only problem is the magnet its very power full and can attract nails and another danger objects.I found one of my cats with a spoon on the magnet and a nail.Thanks!!"
3,Poor follow up,"I bought this game after playing Kirby superstar, one of the best super NES games ever, and was expecting the series to follow a similar development. Kirby's dreamland 3 is [very similare to] super mario world 2, yet not as creative or imaginitive. It moves slow and tediously, and we have none of the fast paced excitement, story features, or extra games that made superstar so awesome. The only thing that was kept was kirby's abilities to absorb enemies powers, but even this is second rate, seeing as he cannot do any of the powerstunts like before."
4,Good teach-yourself German course,"I'm enjoying this conversational German text. It builds on words taught in lists, recycling them into coversations at the end of each unit. It seems relatively fast moving to me, but I am a first time German learner and it keeps me intersted. Commendably it uses words and phrases in rich, multi-layered social situations which make the language more memorable. I would recommend this course."
2,hastily put together,"This German course is cheaply put together, but not altogether awful. The audio on CD is worthless without the course book. The audio goes along extremely fast. The coursebook is a 460 page paperback novel-sized. I am on page 56 and have spotted around 4-5 errors already (duplicate sentences, sentences that don't match up with the audio) which indicated the cheap editing. The small dictionary that comes with it is good for beginners. All-in-all, you get what you pay for. I would recommend buying a PC based course available for the same amount of money."
1,Bait and Switch,"I ordered a specific version of a German language program and Amazon switched the order to a similar but different version, which was not useful for my class. Neither the seller nor Amazon took any responsibility. Beware.John Bliss"
4,Great for the Money,"I bought this for my girlfriend after reading the reviews here, which were very accurate. I had no problems with missing or damaged hardware. I thought I did, but some of the screws are just a bit longer than others, and it only goes together one way, so double check before you panic. It took about a half hour to set up and the instructions are clear. This is not one of those tall drafting tables. At the tallest adjustment, it is just barely over normal table height. This is no problem, but I bought it together with the chair Amazon recommended, the one with the circular foot rail, and the chair does not fit under the desk with the (optional) circle footrest extension in. No big deal, but just order yourself an adjustable height task chair and you will be fine. It actually exceeded my expectations at this price point."
5,Perfect fit for me!,"I wasn't sure this was what I wanted, but once I got it unpacked I was pretty happy with what I saw. Assembly was pretty straight foreword and even though I am not able to move my lower body a whole lot, I had no trouble putting it all together in about an hour. Had my wife help me set it upright as it is a bit heavy once it is assembled, and that's because it is well made. Very happy with it except for the drawer system which is functional but cheap. Probably the best they could do though and once I retightened the screws that hold it together I'm satisfied. Probably better tables out there, but not at this price!"
4,MUCH nicer than the plastic ones,This unit is considerably nicer that the plastic units. It is much more durable and much better looking. It will still have the same problem of the screw portion needing to be replaced on a regular basis (wax kills the Teflon coating). This thing will last forever!
1,nice idea... waste of money,"This was our SECOND ""rabbit""... indeed, like the first one, it broke after a few months... we're back to using the old-fashioned corkscrews... eventually they break, too, but at least they're not nearly so expensive to replace!"
3,"Great, but . . .","I have loved my copy of Core Power for almost two years and bought Journey into Power thinking that it would be great to have another short, effective Baron session to alternate with it. They are almost identical, except Journey is truly for beginners. Journey is a wonderful tape for those new to yoga, but if you have some experience go with Core Power. And if you have Core Power, for don't bother with this one."
5,Best commentary on Joel,"After preaching through Joel, I feel like my experience with commentaries may be helpful here. This was the clearest, most accessible, most helpful commentary on the book I've seen. I also used Hubbard (TOTC), Dillard (The Minor Prophets), and Stuart (Word). Of these Stuart was next most helpful, but Garrett was the clear winner.The thing that stands out most is the clear-headed reasoning in the conclusions on a book where there is a great amount of disagreement. The excursus on interpreting prophecy attached to chapter 4 (ch. 3 in the BHS) is well worth reading for anyone preaching on ANY prophetic book.If you're preaching on Joel, this commentary is the best place to start."
5,Leupold is it,"When you need to mount a solid piece of glass, don't skimp on the base. Installation is easy, just make sure you have the right torque settings. These bases are built with high manufacturing tolerances. You won't be disappointed."
3,Ambitious but rambles a bit,"His concept: to tell a mystery through the interlocking stories of several people connected with a conspiratorial entity, looking back over an event. It's ambitious and tackles many ideas and hypocrisies within our society, which was inspirational to me, but is LONG and is doubly burdened with lengthy discursive passages and character explication that takes awhile. This is one of the most ambitious mystery novels I have read, and somewhere, I think Agatha and Dashiell are cheering. If you can handle a slightly longer and more complex read, this is a rewarding story without the whiz-bang effects common now."
5,Great?,I guess this thing works great! My husband uses it ALL THE TIME!!!! :)He got it to play Tecmo Bowl on the old Nintendo and apparently it is exactly what he needed. If I ever get to talk to him again I will let you know how it's working out.
1,Do Not Buy This!,"This item claims to be machine washable, but if you were to wash it, it would just fall apart in the washing machine."
5,One of my favourites,"Classic sword and sorcery done RIGHT. Just finished the trilogy and I can now say that it's become one of my favourites. It's got everything - bad ass warrior babes, norse mythology, werewolves, witches, vampires, zombies... it's just a pleasure to read from start to finish. Just like the blurb on the back says ""The heavy metal of fantasy adventure"" just AWESOME."
2,spoilt by Leonora,"This is really not an advisable recording because of Floriana Cavall's Leonora. A pity, in view of the presence of Bergonzi, Ghiaurov, etc.i"
2,Poor camerawork ruins a good concert,"One more concert DVD ruined by cameramen who think they are the star. They cut from one shot to another so fast that you have to feel sick to your stomach.It's a shame, because Girls Aloud are terrific."
3,UK Made Blu-ray DVD's do not play on US Blu-ray Players,"UK (United Kingdon - England)made DVD's do not play on conventional DVD players. They will, however play on your computer (when equipped) The same thing with a Blu-ray DVD. It will not play on your conventional Blu-ray player, however will play on a Blu-ray Player DVD ON A COMPUTER."
1,Doesn't yet play,It isn't playing on my Sony BD-s360. I'll post if/when I get it working.Looks like this and other G.A. BDs aren't supported by Sony BD players.
5,Love it,I love it. It's like I'm there watching them live. The only thing I dislike is how much sarah talks through the whole thing like everybodys there to see her when in reality they're there to see the girls. The performance and costumes are great. Love Girls Aloud <3
5,Just what I needed,"I was looking for some great snes games that I played when I was a kid and this was one of them!! Just what I needed to refresh myself on what I enjoyed when I was younger , great condition and great game !"
3,"Ok, but difficult","It was an alright game. I bought to play with my son, but it was too hard for him and he wasn't very interested."
1,VERY POOR QUALITY,"While this is a ""Bargain"" CD it's really not worth the price.The CD is mastered very poorly and the songs are all radio versions. There has yet to be a definitive CD on Mr. Wells and only ""Hot"" productions has released material on him.Hot productions CD's tend to have very poor quality and as of late are releasing CD's that are transferred from vinyl!Not worth the money."
2,Not the Best,"Found this book somewhat of a disorganized read and lacking in continuity. The combination of constantly changing typefaces, different content/writing styles, and pages which were just way too busy (bordering on the messy) made reading this book less than enjoyable. I got nothing which conveyed the charm, history, or intrigue of the Valley. A much better and superior read is the Valley of the Kings chapter within Thomas Hoving's book on Tutankhamun. Basically a textbook or resource for quickly checking facts and figures. Book does, however, contain beautiful photographs and drawings."
4,Racism is still Real,"This book chronicles the experience of a black man who is a priest in a church that is White. While the book is somewhat dated today, it still captures the racism that is faced by black Catholics in a church that is still mostly White. This book would invite you to ponder on the possibility of being black and Catholic. The book is easy to read and the author is transparent as he shares his feelings. The book needs a revision."
1,Hillerman has nothing to worry about,"Comparing this book to Tony Hillerman is like comparing apples to wilted spinach.The main characters have nothing in common and are as grating on the reader as they are to one another. Descriptions jump around, making the story harder to follow than it should be. Had Emmet and Anna been more compelling and likable, I probably would have stuck this one out to the the end, instead of abandoning it when I couldn't put up with them anymore."
5,There's a new badge in town...,"If you're a fan of Indian Country whodunits, Kirk Mitchell is tops. I could go on, but I'd just be repeating myself. This is a terrific read."
4,Cry Dance - Mitchell,This book arrived promptly and in like-new condition... thank you. Let's do business again!
3,Not bad,This book is pretty good but it is not an easy read. The first section of the book seems to just try and convince the reader of all the parallels that exist between Adlerian Therapy and every other form of popular current therapy. If you can get past the first part it gets better.
2,Too easy,"This game only has two levels and both play backgammon pretty poorly. If you're halfway decent at backgammon, you'll have a hard time losing against the computer which takes away from the enjoyment."
4,not bad,"This is not going to lift your work from mediocrity to genius, frankly there are some quite bad illustrations in here; but, there are some good ones too. The photo reference section is really well done, and in my opinion should have been expanded. the character development section is not very well done or in my opinion very useful. All in all, the book has a certain charm, some good reference and advise, and no book is going to answer everyone's questions"
4,Fantasy Anatomy is a good aid,"if you are trying to have a better handle on how to sketch the human figure in action, this book is helpful. You don't have to be a cartoon or dungeons' n dragons fan to use it. In the middle there is a section of poses with real people with various action poses to illustrate the figure and principles discussed earlier in the book."
3,Okay stuff,"This book is okay and has some good information, but some of the artwork isn't very awe inspiring. Not too bad though."
2,2 stars at best,"Awful, awful book. I am a student enrolled in an art school and wanted to improve in my anatomy and digital painting skills so I picked up this book. Luckily I did not have to put out any money to buy this book. I borrowed it from a friend. He too thought it was awful. The drawings in this books are amateur and crude at best. I went through pages after pages of anatomical errors. The only good things in the book were some of the fantasy picture the author borrowed from other great fantasy artists. Trust me, stay clear from this book!"
4,Anatomy for Fantasy Artists: An Illustrator's Guide to Creating Action Figures and Fantastical Forms,This is a good book if you want to learn how to draw action figures that are real life people not creatures
4,Mad jack is mad fun,"Flaming Mad jack is a very fun toy . Heavily articulated and comes with a good amount of accesories . He even has a light in his that turns red when his left arm is raised or the button is pressed . the 2 pumpkin bombs are really big for his hand and have a specific groove that has to be just right for him to hold it . the glider doesnt fit my figures feet tho , so i bend the toes up to keep him held in place . The price is great and he isnt easy to get a hold of . a very fun figure for your spiderman collection"
1,Junk,Has never been used more than a few times without deciding not to start and requiring a repairman. My worst purchase ever.
4,The ugly duckling,"My previous Hitachi 16 gauge nailer served me well for over 25 years. Sadly, when the driver rod got so warn that it started jamming frequently, I took it to my local tool repair guy only to learn that Hitachi no longer provided parts for that model. My hope is that I can get half the service life out of this new one. So far so good. No problems to report. My only complaint with this tool - as with so many of the new Hitachi tools - is the ridiculous looking plastic and rubber decorations that make them look more like athletic shoes than serious tools. I wince whenever I look at it, but it gets the job done. I took away one star out of five for UGLY."
5,Feels like part of your arm,"This is the most comfortable gun I own. So far I've used a little more than half a box of nails, no jams or double shots. I actually used it for deck work yesterday. I had no framing nails, but I wanted to replace the top of all the railing on my deck. Well the best I had was 2.5"" galvanized for this gun, so I used them to tack up the new planks. I expected some nails to sit high, but nothing. The gun shot through all the treated lumber like butter.Hopefully I can find some framing nails this week. While the 16g tacked it down just fine, they're not a solution.Oh yeah, when you actually use it for its intended purpose such as moulding and other trim, nothing beats it."
1,Not worth the money,"I brought this nailer a month ago and I used it on a few remodel jobs. It wasn't what I expected. The depth gauge wasn't setting the nails deep enough, so I tried to adjust it and the adjusting nob barely spun. I oiled the nob up and I still got nothing. I couldn't take pliers to it because it was made of plactic which would brake or strip. I even turned the pressure up on my compressor to 110 psi and the nail head was still exposed."
5,"Beautiful book, faithful re-telling","Beautiful book, full of details. The story is a faithful re-telling of Andersen's story, so the story is not dumbed-down like so many re-tellings of this story are, so it's a bit lengthy and scary. Not for the youngest readers."
1,Ugly is bad and pretty is good,"As an adult, I now understand the meaning of this book; but as a child I actually understood the story to mean that being ugly was bad and made you unloveable and that being pretty was important and made you loveable."
5,"Nice looking, works with command hook strips","I'm very happy with this rack. If you are worried about damaging the cabinet like we are, the base of this rack is wide enough to use medium command hook strips. We got some strips from amazon:3M Command Medium Mounting Refill Strips, 9-Stripand used 6 strips just to be safe. I suspect 4 strips would do the job just fine."
4,Time to buy another,"A good choice for most any decor. This rack fits discreetly under my counter and helped solved the problem of where to keep our increasing collection of glasses. I bought 1 for Christmas to fit our current wine glasses, and my husband bought new rd and white wine glasses at the same time. Time to buy another rack! It fits 3 white and 2 red wine glasses comfortably per slot. To fit 8 glasses, I will need another rack."
5,"Works great, decent price","Installation is straight forward with just screwing the fore corners into the bottom of the cabinet. The spacing of the tracks is perfect. This can fit 3 larger wine glasses (per track) or 4 flutes. Note that it does not come with screws, but that is no big deal since you will probably have them around the house."
5,"great product, simple, strong",I used this on the inside of my kitchen cabinet (not under it as the picture shows) with about 13.5 inches of space to play with. Fits great & is very sturdy.
5,"Super cute, easy to install, good quality",This rack is great. I can add about 3 full-sized wine glasses to each row. It's sturdy and stainless steel so it looks classy. It attaches to the underside of cabinents with screws that feel secure so I'm not worried at all about the rack falling!
5,PERFECT!,"I bought my lady a giant wine decanter/glasses set for Christmas, and it used up all our counter space storing all that swill! So I bought this, installed it with nothing but a screwdriver in 2 minutes, and problem solved! Simple, logical, effective."
5,Simple and effective,"Well, there's not a whole lot to say about this product. It didn't quite fit all our large wine glasses right next to each other, but we tend to drink a variety of wines, so we have 3 champagne glasses in the center, 3 of our smaller wine glasses to the left, (somehow) 3 of our large glasses on the right. Fits in kitchen well. Solid construction and easy installation."
5,Perfect,"This went in my new cabinets and is a second one, as I already had one. It's exactly what I need and does exactly what it says. I set my cabinets up with my adjustable shelves so that I can hang glasses upside down and still have space underneath to put other glasses. I've already had envious looks from people who come and see my new kitchen."
5,great,"Very good, and easy to install. Holds big or little wine glasses. and looks great and out of the way."
1,Deceptive premise,"This film may be a good purchase if you can find it in a bargain basement sale, but, for $25.00, it did not deliver. The 2 disk package is comprised of a brief ""hollow earth"" theory and presentation by a mumbling lecturer. Many of his comments were inaudible. Also, there was little evidence to substantiate his claims. Though i did not time the first segment, it seemed to be less than an hour. What follows is a boring expose on the Artic and Antartica. This very long segment finishes the first disk and runs well into the second. We see ice, polar bears, many penquins, walruses and ancient footage of early explorers.There is no UFO subject matter. The final segment, an old black and white docu-drama,was more than i could sit through. This DVD was deceptive as it was marketed as UFO exploratory research.Don't waste your money,,,this one's a dud."
1,Ouch!,"This is likely the poorest quality DVD I've purchased. It frequently froze screen and skipped sections when playing on a high quality DVD player; there are no menus. However, it played better on the computer's DVD.The information is out-of-date, and poorly filmed. Several very old newsreels on Iceland, the antarctic, and historical sailors do not have much to do with the title."

4,Death in the Islands,"Susan Morrow's A SEASON OF EVIL written in 1969 is romantic suspense with a strong female protagonist. Espionage in the Virgin Islands as Midge Thorton uses a commission to create a pirate puppet show to aid Ramsey Quinn and Joe Emmett. Joe is a man she has unwitting fallen in love with and Quinn has rather vague connections to prevent trouble.The U.S. Virgin Islands have a population of 85% black and are on the very edges of resort development. The Islands are perfect for a power taker over that could force their development back forty years. Susan's job is to discover who is the master mind behind the plot.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS."
1,Lovers in Prague...,"I was disappointed watching this. Acting okay, actors ugly and storyline pretty boring. I really enjoyed Lovers in Paris and i thought this one will be better since theyre from the same producers.i dont recommend watching this series cuz its pretty boring and i just cant stand watching ugly actors playing the lead role. It doesnt make u fall in love with the series itself."
1,Not worth it,"Allison's work does manage to avoid postmodernist jargon, but not the rest of the pomo tendencies. His Nietzsche is an irrationalist with no contributions to knowledge or philosophy worth remembering. The book is tiresome and the prose tends toward moralism, pedantry and saccarine pride at being a postmodern moralizer. The industry review supplied here at Amazon is innacurate: the chapters are on Birth of Tragedy, The Gay Science, Zarathustra and the Genealogy of Morals ONLY! There is no chapter on Beyond Good and Evil, not on The Antichrist, nor on Twilight of the Idols, nor on the autobiography. I disagree that Allison has covered the principal works since he ignores so many of them.If you want another Heideggerian-Derridian ""reading"" that is more about living people than about Nietzsche, then maybe this is for you. But if you want to learn about Nietzsche's ideas and what he means for the real life of the mind today, this book will not assist you."
4,This is now my most reached for Lingo reference.,"After living with Lingo Dictionary 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0 the layout of Lingo Prog Ref has been a real welcome. Unlike the dictionary that ships with Director, the authors here have wisely arranged commands by topic first, and then alphabetically within the topic. This simple act has led me to numerous new understadings of Lingo mermely by having related commands right there and with sound examples. The level of explanation for the commands does vary quite a bit. Some go into more depth than others. Some of the examples are shy on depth. This a reference book even makes good reading. It has been a wise purchase."
5,An indispensable Lingo reference.,"It's what the Lingo Dictionary should have been and much more. Every piece of Lingo is thoroughly explained, and put into ""real world"" context. Numerous code examples help to clarify tough points. Buy it. I guarantee you'll wear it out"
3,Misleading name.,"""Not street legal!"" is a bit dramatic. It may be that doesn't have an API rating, but the Oil Police aren't going to stop you and give you a ticket if you use it. Instead...use Valvoline's VR-1 racing oil which is SH rated if you're paranoid about being an ""outlaw""."
4,It's the coolest game ever!,"Its the best game I ever owned! It has cool music you won't stop and there is a easy to hard level and there is a total of 8 Fighter'S to pick from ryu,ken,chun Li, and more it has nice music that makes you want to fight more!You gotta own this game!"
1,Mortal Kombat blew this away!,"Street Fighter II was a crappy fighting game that was completley unplayable.The gameplay is awful and the cartoon graphics just made it even worse.Mortal Kombat had it ALL OVER Street Fighter II in ALL of these areas.Mortal Kombat really shines in the graphics compared to this heap of crap.Playing as realistic digitized characters was just so much better than playing with animated cartoonie looking dorks like Ryu or Ken.Pass this up and get Mortal Kombat instead.I know Mortal Kombat 1 for SNES did not have the blood and gore,but it was and STILL is better than this.Bottom line is...ALL Street Fighter games suck and Mortal Kombat is better in EVERY WAY...MK ALL THE WAY!"
5,Awesome!,This has always been a great game. It's so much easier playing it on this platform than XBox and all it's buttons ;-)
4,Can't kill the classics,"Excellent classic fighting game, brings back the old days just playing it again. Of course, in my opinion SF2 Turbo was a little more fun having all the characters and smoother action. Still, great game."
1,Don't watch this if you actually have taste in movies,"This movie is as pathetic as teenage life itself. There is no plot, climax, or resolution -- Lola claims to learn something at the end, but there was nothing to be learned in the movie. It's a pointless series of events capturing melodramatic and ""glorified"" (that is, exaggerated) teenage angst. I can't stand the idea that sixteen year old girls will be watching this movie and believing it to be worth their while. If you value your time, money, and sanity, DO NOT watch this film."
1,Lol-ing at the amount of suck.,"Very creepy bathtub/ shower/ bed cuddling scenes between Miley Cyrus and Demi Moore. Unfortunately, for perverts, they're pretty PG. It's just a compilation of cliche teen scenes (ex: passing out flyers, taking a school trip abroad, giggling in bed with a boy, your mom reading your diary, arguing for no reason, spooning with your mother?, going to a rock show, a love triangle, a solid clique of friends... you get it.) Unfortunately, for teens, none of it makes any sense. I could say more, but that pretty much sums up the film."
4,Good for teens,"Good movie for teens, this was funny, different a bit refreshing and enjoyable for the girls [pretty much only] It's a girl movie."
5,Good chick flick,"I love miley cyrus and demi moore was really good in this movie. SO a chick flick though, my bf thought it was stupid"
5,dvd movie,"if your looking for some good dvd movies, from new to oldd, then i recomend this place, they have a good selection"
3,Better than I expected,"The movie LOL was better than I expected. Lionsgate didn't do justice to the Miley Cyrus film by failing to give it a proper promotion. I enjoyed the movie. For myself, I could relate to the trials and tribulations of being a teenager and experimenting with my friends. It was totally believable. I recommend this for anyone 13 years old and up. Thank You, Richard."
3,Fun and entertaining,"I wasn't expecting a lot from ""LOL"" the new Miley Cyrus movie. It was panned by the critics everywhere and it was a box office failure, but I still watched it and I'm glad I did. The story is refreshing, the music is great and it stays to reality; also the characters are very relatable to anyone's friend circle: the two best friends, the ""bitchy"" girl, the guy friends and the good-looking guy.I also liked the fact of the use of technology, which is a thing that moves teens nowadays and that's the way everybody stays in touch and it was well used for the plot.I also liked the fact that they also gave Demi Moore some minutes for her character because it's so typical that in teen movies you only see the parents when they are home and you never get to know about their story, it's always about the teens, but not in this one.If you're looking for a good teen movie, try LOL, it's not really something new, but you'll have a good time. Give it a chance"
1,Yawn,"This was a total snooze fest. I guess it was supposed to be a comedy, but I was not amused. Miley and Demi were both not believable and I would think that the only people who would enjoy this movie are 15-18 yo females."
1,Terrible,The story structure and acting were terrible. The movie itself was all over the place and awkward. The music was the only thing that was ok.
1,yikes,this movie was about as good as i expected it to be. but i needed a chick flick to watch while the hubby was away. wouldn't recommend it (and i'm a miley fan)
1,Absolutely terrible!,I do not recommend anyone to see this movie. Poor story line and unpleasant acting.I advise no one to watch this movie.
2,eh,"It's not the worst movie i've ever seen, the issue's in this movie definitely are some teenagers go through. However I think the plotline wasn't very good and the acting wasn't phenomenal. I like the friendship between the main characters, but that was about it."
4,"Love Miley, this is a really awesome lil flick, & diff role for Miley to do.","She is like every other Teen, in High school. Texting, she learns how to deal with life & her situations with boys, her girl bffs.& other BS that she faces, all to reach Paris thru the French class trip she & her buds equally are looking forward to.Demi Moore as Miley's mom, was perfect casting.Film was just fun, but you feel for poor Miley & the need to be herself, have a self identity, despite her mom's own depression& fear Mlieys character Lol will turn out like her.If you love Miley no matter what, you should give this film a chance.Forget cute, & silly Miley from the past, & watch this with open mind & eyes. Enjoy- Lov BB"
2,Boring and unoriginal,This movie just lacked so many things. The storyline isn't original and the set-up just didn't hold my interest. Definitely wouldn't recommend.
3,Marlo Thomas is terrific!,"I guess this movie is okay for teens. As an adult, the flow was sloppy and the script lacking, however, Marlo Thomas really makes this movie more enjoyable. I mean, Marlo pretty much gives this movie the punch for adults. But, as a teen, I can see why that group would like this film. Demi is great, and Miley is, well Miley."
3,"Real and fun, but not really fun","We rented this on a whim with our daughters, who have been fans of Miley Cyrus. However, this is pretty grown up for fans of the old Hannah Montana.I will say that it's a pretty realistic coming of age film depicting real issues affecting teenagers and families today. The problem is that I didn't find much plot here, though it was well acted by Miley Cyrus and Demi Moore.Not an unpleasant film, but also not very memorable. And definitely not a feel-good movie."
3,Pleasant piece for fans of Demi Moore,"I was able to catch this movie in it's very limited theatrical run, and happy to do so in order to catch up with my favorite actor, Demi Moore. She was the only reason why I went.I enjoyed the movie. I think the acting was very good, I appreciated most of the twists and turns of the mother's and daughter's lives, a good supporting cast (all the guys cast as love interests are just fine), a terrific soundtrack, and the whole package was good to look at. I know very little about Myley Cyrus, and I did not see the movie to specifically watch her; she was fine, I guess.I wouldn't have missed this movie. It's similar to Demi's recent ""Happy Tears"", and like its predicessor, she gets nearly 50% of the screen time. If you like her in these types of family dramedies, it's a pretty good way to spend an evening."
3,Great or Eeeeeeep?,"Despite this sounding like HANNAH NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, I know this will be a competent presentation with talented people like Miley and Demi. I guess I'll understand its (non)marketing when I see it."
1,Sound?,I did not like this movie. For some reason all I could hear was music. No words. I could have lived with it if there were captions. I've watched one other movie on Amazon and had no problems but do not plan on watching another Amazon Instant Video. A movies not a movie without words.
4,Fun,"It was fun, though I am one to live vicariously through movies. It's obviously geared toward the teenage crowd, but fun."
2,Not interesting!,"I just didn't find it interesting. I don't think kids need to watch this kind of stuff, there's enough out in real life. It kills me how there's always a kid crying about not being trusted by their parent and then they prove why they shouldn't be."
4,great movie,i choose this rating because alot of people can relate to this film [meaning teenage girls]and it has a familar face
2,Uninteresting,"The French version was sort of cute, the Americanization not even that! Very young teenagers or teenage adults maybe would like it!"
1,Not as good as expected,"Wouldn't recommend to anyone. There was no plot whatsoever and the whole movie was just drama. It was such a boring movie to watch...I kept thinking, ""It will get better, something is going to happen..."", but nothing ever did. Just a long string of arguments and a teenager acting out."
3,The movie was good but not great.,"I watched the movie, it was good but not great, but was worth the cost. It was a movie that I thought would be interesting and enjoyable to watch. Although I did not think the movie that great it was equal to what I paid."
1,Slow,"Never got going into anything interesting. Hardly held my attention. It was very slow. Disappointing. Could have been very cute, but the plot just wasn't good at all."
1,bad generation to worst,"wow, how low has the career of demi moore sunk that she has agreed to this? a bunch of immature adults and vacuous teenagers thrown together with no discernible plot whatsoever. the only point that that i could make from this debacle of a film is that if this is the worst american generation the one preceding it wasn't that far off either."
5,"Mild and Gentle, great for sensitive skin","Finding a face wash that didn't completely dry out my face has been a challenge, but this product fits the bill nicely. It doesn't have much of an odor, and doesn't claim to be antibacterial, but it leaves your face feeling smooth and clean. I ordered this variety and got the sensitive skin instead of the extra gentle version, but it's only a little bit stronger. Local stores have quit carrying both, so I can't complain. This product probably wouldn't cut it if you have very oily skin, but it'd never caused me any kind of irritation, unlike Nivea's non-sensitive skin products. It doesn't have any acne preventing chemicals such as Salicylic acid, so if you require one you'll need a separate product, but for a fresh clean face, this works great!"
3,Different bottle than advertised,"So this bottle and brand used to be my favorite brand of face wash. However, they have since done away with this brand. When I ordered it, I ordered 6 bottles of it, and I received 6 bottles of a different kind of Nivea face wash, in a white bottle instead of the grey. I do like the white bottle face wash, but not as much as the grey. Keep that in mind before you purchase."
1,Not Ms. Walker's Best...,"Unarmed with the language and depth that is an earmark of Alice Walker's wonderful body of work, this novel was an unexpected disappointment.The ambitious title left me anticipating a memoir with the strong character of You Can't Keep a Good Woman Down, deftly weaving the fictional with nonfiction. Rather, I found the introduction staid and the remainder of the novel difficult, rambling, and not fulfilling, lacking the strength I admire from Walker's other works.What is redeeming about this book is the tone--the very apparent importance to Walker herself in the telling of her story leaving the reader with an appreciation for the effort if not for the work itself."
5,peace with the changes life offers,"alice walker weaves her ideas very subtly into her stories. her books contain a philosophy but it manages to inhance not detract from the novel itself. The short stories in the way forward is with a broken heart are her most successful yet. She explores emotions and reactions to love so deep you can't imagine it going away. Her narrative is natural, you can taste her discriptions. The stories can be absolutely heartbreaking but they feel peaceful too. a wonderful book, I fully recommend it."
3,Nothing new here,"Everything Alice Walker writes and talks about in this little volume, she's written and talked about before and the ""before"" texts such as The Color Purple and Possessing the Secret of Joy along with essays such as Am I Blue? say things a heck of a lot better than her latest work, The Way Forward is With a Broken Heart. A disappointing read overall."
4,"Five stars for the opening, three stars for rest","First of all, Alice Walker is one of my favorite writers - she's probably in my all-time five favorites, if fact. This book is not her best, but it is very, very good.The opening section, ""To My Young Husband,"" is wonderful and beautiful and brilliant. The rest of the book, unfortunately, is not quite so good - some of the stories are excellant, but some of the others are, at least by Walker's standards, rather mediocre. Still, I'd definitely reccond this book to any fan of Alice Walker's books."
2,For Walker Devotees Only,"Because Alice Walker is deemed ""important"" for American fiction, I guess her part-memoir will have some place for some scholar at some point. But it's not literature and does not even rank very high as part-memoir. It reads like a journal, not a great writer's journal, but an often shallow woman's musings on the ups and downs of her life mixed with a little fiction. I'm not sure it would have been published at all if it weren't authored by Walker."
1,Waste of money,"I regretted purchasing the hardbound book from the 3rd page. I found this book barely tolerable to finish. It is saccharine, written like a junior high school love letter, offers no depth or insight."
5,"Lyrical, uplifting","This is my first Alice Walker book -- I saw The Color Purple several times, but had not read any of her work. Two weeks ago, this book spoke to me from the shelves of a Seattle-area bookstore, and so I took it home. I read it this past weekend, in an introspective mood due to the death of a friend and my spouse's move back to PA later this month.It was a beautiful book - lyrical and matter-of-fact at the same time (the casual mention of a gun in the bedroom in the 60s in Mississippi). As a southern woman (about a decade younger than Ms. Walker), I appreciated seeing my home from another perspective. I felt more kindly towards my own eccentric relatives and laughed at the thought of taking my own mother and her sisters to see ""Deep Throat""! (no way am I that brave - or foolhardy!)I laughed and I cried and felt reassured that wisdom is possible with perseverance. And I was inspired to read more Alice Walker - plus I'll share this copy with my friends. Highly recommended."
1,"not eligible for a ""good"" gift","I received in the mail today and am very disappointed. It is pretty cheap. Note the weight of the item. It is less than four ounces. Also, the barometic needle is stuck at the very bottom of the dial. While looking for a nice gift, this is not it, and if it is broken or not, it is not distinctive in any way."
4,Dad loved it!,"My father loved Dominos and he has really enjoyed this game. Just wish it had arrrived as promised, before Christmas."
5,Amazing!,"Some of the earliest memories I have are of hanging out in my family's living room listening to this album loud enough to wake the neighbors (my parents were party animals even then!). Then I had a radio show in college a couple of years ago, and so I dusted off my parents' old LP of this album and played it one night. The response was immediate and enthusiastic--""we want more!"" So, ""House of the Rising Sun"" became the disco anthem of the 1990's for a small, sleepy southern college town, a phenomenon which is proof that great music really does stand the test of time."
2,nice but not comfortable,"The shoes look nice, yet they are not comfortable because sling would constantly slip off, which keeps you busy putting it back all the time and also looks ugly when it is not in its proper place. For this reason the feel more like flip-flpos or slip-ons rather than the elegant sandals they look. Also, after the first and only time I wore them I had blisters on my toes."
4,Good find,"Highly recommend both cd's. Excellent band with a great vocalist!I missed this band when they were around, But thanks to the Internet another cool discovery for me.Will they ever release another cd?????????"
2,"Great picture, poor quality","I am on my 2nd set in 5 months. The first set's fan assembly went out, and the parts were back-ordered for 2 months. My 2nd set has lasted about 4 weeks before it started having intermittent problems with a loud buzzing and a random shutting off of the TV set. Still jumping through hoops with Toshiba to get this sucker fixed or replaced....Having said all of that, the picture of this set is fantastic. So, if you're feeling lucky, go for it. Just make sure you buy an extended warranty, and have another TV set available for those long weeks when this puppy is in the repair shop.Needless to say, I will never buy Toshiba again..."
4,pretty good,"the main reason I bought this TV was the price. 1080 and 62"" for about $2,200. As another reviewer stated, the bulb on my TV exploded about 1 month into use. The customer reps didn't give me much hassle about sending a new one out. I've been using the new bulb for about 6 months now with no problem.I think the picture is great. I use a HD cable box and upconverting DVD player, both via HDMI cables. I have no problem with either yet.2 reasons for not having 5 stars is the bulb popping, and the sound is subpar. I know it's expected to use a home reciever, but Toshiba still should have made the sound better then they did. You will have to buy a reciever with this TV. The lack of sound quality will annoy you after a month or two, like it did me."
4,"Good Picture, Short Bulb Life","We have had the Toshiba 62HM195 for about two years now, and we are on our third bulb. To Toshiba's credit, the first bulb was replaced at no cost to us, since the bulb which came with the television was defective. The next bulb lasted about a year and a half. A replacement bulb ran around $200... I can not imagine they will go down in price from this point on.When it is working, the picture looks great. We have used it with High-Def cable programming, video game systems, HD-DVDs, and Blu-Ray discs, and it performs well."
4,Good condition but very late arriving,The book was in good condition and well wrapped but was so late arriving it was a bit ridiculous.
5,Great Ragged Rocking Record,"Verlaine's best records are the first three Television albums (the second and third are underrated by many people), and this one. It's got the same ragged glory to it, swinging hard, just awesome. This is probably his loudest record, for whatever that's worth."
5,Spinal Injury & Diabetes,I have a spinal injury that happened in the year 2000 and I have type II diabetes. This Resistance Chair works wonders for me. It helps me keep my muscles from tightening up and it helps me keep my diabetes under control. I will be ordering the overhead accessory in the near future to help with my shoulder mobility and the exercise pedals to help my legs. I also like the ease of moving it around and storing it. I also use the non skid seat cushion as it is very comfortable.
4,Nice Accessory for Chair.,I purchased this cushion at the same time I purchased the chair and it came in the box with the chair. The cushion is no great thing it is just a seat cushion with a little non-skid cover but fits with the chair nicely and does offer a little added comfort. It is not really necessary for the chair but if you are really heavy or have issues sitting upright then this is a nice accessory.
1,VQ Action Care -Non-Skid Seat Cushion,"I found this seat cushion very uncomfortable on the resistance chair. As you can see I gave it one star. Wanted to give it no stars, but it wouldn't take it. I would have returned it, but figured it would cost me at least half the price of the cushion, so it's just in the closet. Just wish I had tried the chair first. It is so comfortable, no need for a cushion."
2,Thinner than store-bought variety,"I bought this chair cushion online b/c of the convenience and was disappointed when I compared it to my store-bought variety. It is at least 1/2 as thin and not nearly as effective. It does stay put like I wanted, but it simply doesn't cushion enough."
5,It's worked well for me,"While it's true that this keyboard does not have an action equaling a fine piano, I've never the less been using it live for several years, and no one has a problem with my playing. I like the heavy action, and I fell into playing it quickly and easily. Firstly the amount of midi control that this has is almost overwhelming. Complex splits can be managed with ease, and with 17 buttons, 24 knobs, and 9 faders, you can control just about anything. The buttons are in a straight line right above the keyboard for easy access, I can bring loops in and out without missing a beat. All of the controls, including the transport controls, are thoughtfully placed with the performer in mind. The bottomline is, if it broke, (knock on wood), I'd get another one. I love my pro 88.Oh. And the price. The price."
2,No Repairs from M-Audio,"We have this keyboard for about 18 months and one of the keys is non-responsive. Just learned from M-Audio's support line that they will not offer repair - only parts. Assuming we can repair the product ourselves, I find this a bit disconcerting. Hate to sound old and cynical, but there used to be a time when manufacturers actually stood by their products."
3,Good but incomplete,"I have not yet read the book so I cannot say how the movie compares with it. I like the movie for what it is, however some important scenes have been cut out of this version, such as several times when Aunt Norris treats Fanny badly (telling Fanny she must always be last and have the lowest place, even before her own birthday picnic) and the scene when Edmund asks Fanny her opinion of Miss Crawford. I wish this DVD had all the scenes I remember from when I first saw the movie. It is still enjoyable, though."
2,"Dull, dull, dull",A poor production of an excellent novel of Jane Austen's. No comparison to the other movies I've seen such as Sense and Sensibility.
2,Don't waste your money or time.,"Something throughout the entire movie was lacking, no chemistry and the actors just didn't embrace the parts. It stuck fairly close to the book but left out so much you felt that you were watching the story in fast-forward with no time for character development. Everything about the movie is lacking something."
3,I'd like it better if I didn't know the book,"It's hard to reconcile a well-known novel with its on-screen adaptation.I don't think MasterPiece Theater tried very hard to produce what the novel was -- they just made their own way.For what it's worth, this movie is a nice love story with a little intrigue.Quick summary: Widescreen version, no subtitles, Fanny's hair and bodice were distracting."
2,What a contrast?,"I have a book of the script forMansfield Park (1999).I found this version at a real contrast in which Billie Piper who is at homein Dr. Who is really out of place and never seems to comb her hair.In fact the hair styles in this version are completely out of character for 1820in a manor house?The plot shapes up differently for Sir Thomas with no mention of any affairin the Indies with his black slave mistress.Fanny never goes back to her family in this version either.I ,now, think that neither movie does this famous novel justice.In spite of the many flaws in this version I likedthe movie better than some modern versions of period novelsthat I have seen."
2,Back to the drawing board,"I've seen three versions of Mansfield Park including this one and none of them quite cut it for me. On one the acting and filming was attrocious. On another, the actress playing Fanny Price lacked a look and presence of innocence that the character should have held. In this version, Fanny runs around with her hair scraggly and long--I want the true style of Jane Austin's time period! It is missing far too much of the plot also. I'd like to issue a challenge to a filmaker out there somewhere to make a really good quality Mansfield Park, that has good casting, acting, directing, filming, music, AND costuming, as has been presented in A&E's Pride and Prejudice, the Gwyneth Paltrow version of Emma, both the BBC and Emma Thompson versions of Sense and Sensibility, etc."
2,"Boring, rushed, and ubelievable","If you love Jane Austen, you probably won't like this film. It is rushed, and I don't think the actors play their parts very well. I wasn't convinced that each one WAS the character they were playing. Billie Piper is a lovely girl, but she just isn't Jane Austen type. Her portrayal of Fannie was just...weird. Fanny wasn't the kind of lady you'd expect to see in Jane Austen's time, that's for sure. Even the romance elements of the film were downplayed and rushed. If you're looking for a good period romance, watch ""North and South"" with Richard Armitage. If you want a good Jane Austen film, watch ""Pride and Prejudice"" with Colin Firth, ""Sense and Sensibility"" (either one, but the BBC is more accurate), or ""Northanger Abbey"" by BBC. If you're looking for pretty much a waste of time, watch this version of ""Mansfield Park""."
2,disappointing,"I was very disappointed. I hated the lead actress, Billie Piper. She's awful and just ruined the movie for me. She is so homely and awkward that it's really hard to watch her. My husband refused to keep watching the movie after the first 15 minutes. I finished it because it's one of my favorite stories. This version was better than the 1999 one with Hannah Taylor-Gordon, which butchered the story and misrepresented many of the characters horribly. The only accurate portrayal of this story is the old BBC version with the cheesy staging and bad filming. This version is pretty true to the story, but a lot of detail is left out. I read the book and loved it, so I'm still hoping for a good movie."
2,Readers Digest Condensed...?,"I am a long time fan of Austen's books and movies. However, Mansfield Park is my least favorite J.A. book. The main character, Fanny Price, is the long-suffering poor relation. She is sooooo humble and good that I had trouble believing that certain rakish characters in the book could ever fall in love with her. That said, this new movie adaptation chops a large book into a mere 90 minutes. Characters, locations, and key passages have been completely removed. Mansfield Park wasn't merely condensed - it was crushed. As some earlier reviewers have said, the best way to watch it is to forget the original book and pretend that it's a brand new story."
1,disappointing,"While Mansfield Park is not the most appealing of the Austen novels, it deserved a better effort than this latest version. Most fans of Austen have read the original books, so we understand much of the manners, custom and dress of the times, and have certain expectations. Other reviewers have pointed out the problems, and I agree with them. I also could not get past Fanny's appearance (which was more like a bar maid than even a servant) to have any empathy for the character. I did not understand the director's decision to dress everyone else in the piece for the period and not the main character. Keeping every scene in one spot and mostly in the same room might have been cost effective but hardly does justice to the richer world that Austen was so adept at portraying. Although I own most DVD versions of other Austen productions, I know I will not want to see this again. My recommendation is to watch it on PBS or rent it before you buy."
1,"Yikes, Ms. Austen, look what they've done to Fanny this time!","The sheer unadulterated awfulness of this absolutely amazes me. Fanny Price as a flirty, pouty, bosoms almost falling out, bottle blonde with bed hair and an acting style straight out of ""Tom Jones"" pretty much ruins the whole thing singlehandedly. The intended villainess, Mary Crawford, looks downright demure by comparison and a far more suitable match for a clergyman. Then there's the inconsistent uncle who starts out Simon Legree and ends up Father Knows Best. And the otherwise adequate and attractive actor playing Edmund who's given about 15 seconds of close-up across the family breakfast table to show, with just his face, the aha! moment when he realizes it's Fanny he loves after all. That scene alone may end up earning this movie a place in the so-bad-it's-funny pile. I don't think Jane Austen is turning in her grave; I think she's laughing herself silly at the ludicrousness of it all."
2,Under false colors,"This is not Jane Austen's ""Mansfield Park""--it's another story altogether, from another place and time. The first, and establishing portion, of the novel has completely disappeared, the themes of the Austen book have vanished, the language is pure 21st century, and the characters, their bearing and their manners bear no resemblance to the originals--the actors just happen to be wearing Regency garb.I would have no objection to, and would in fact enjoy, watching a good melodrama decked out in 18th century costumes--just don't try to tell me that this is ""Mansfield Park."""
2,Glad I didn't buy it,"I love Jane Austen and this version of Mansfield Park, well, who ever decided on the costumes should be fired. Through the entire movie I kept telling Fannie 'put your hair up'. The Bertram's would have had her put her hair up and have her be presentable. For her and all the other women, I kept wanting to tell them 'cover your chest'. The dresses weren't even from Jane's time period. The only thing I LOVED about this version was Edmund's discovery of loving Fannie and his mother's awareness to support it."
2,Dissapointing,I was not impressed with this version of Mansfield Park. It seemed stilted and not up to the standard of the Jane Austen novel.
2,my review,i viewed this CD and found that the roles of edmund and fanny have been carved out pretty nicely. the entire of the story takes place at Mansfield park and this blocks the part where fanny was pushed back to her home in the original story. All in all was an enjoyable piece to watch out for as a Jane Austen fan !!!
2,Masterpiece Theater: Mansfield Park,"When I saw this on TV, it was referred to as simply ""Masterpiece,"" possibly the producer's name. It was not presented as Masterpiece Theater nor was it a BBC production. I thought the script and the acting were sub par. I note the cover picture only states ""Masterpiece."" I believe you are in error referring to it as ""Masterpiece Theater."""
2,Not good enough.,"As a fan of Jane Austen's novels, I've been thrilled at the wonderful screen adaptations that have been made. I was disappointed in this one. It was boring, miscast and too short to do the plot justice. One of these days, somebody will make a great miniseries of Mansfield Park - or we can hope."
2,Some small merit,"This is a rushed, abridged version missing many valuable componants...Fannie Price's family and it's influence on her character, the childhood of the leads, and clearer views of the family scandals. Ms. Piper is the Belle du Jour, but a poor fit here. There's nothing really wrong with her acting, but she's too modern looking and whoever dressed her made her look like and ill kempt farm girl. The whole time I was watching I wanted to part and comb her hair.The rest of the cast was good, especially the cast of Edmund. But this is a lightweight peice not destined to be a classic. Poor M P will once again have to wait for a better adaptation."
2,Masterpiece Theatre disappointment,I expected much better for Masterpiece Theatre. It is based only loosely on the novel and leaves out many important scenes and characters. So far the best video of this novel is put out by BBC.
3,Why Must Modern Movie-Makers Make These Things Politically Correct?,"While this movie did not bother me too much and was quite enjoyable in some places, I will never understand why modern movie-makers feel like they have to make politically correct comments in movies from this time period. I do not recall when Wilberforce started his anti-slavery movement in England, but if Austen didn't make a reference to it in her book, is it likely that Fanny would have questioned Sir Thomas's slave-owning tendencies? Both this movie and the '99 version did it, this one thankfully MUCH less. Yes, we all know NOW that slavery is wrong, evil, etc., but back then it was a way of life, and I seriously doubt that meek little Fanny Price would have said anything about it."
1,So disappointed!,"I was so looking forward to a new version of Mansfield Park. Most of us were disappointed in the 1999 movie. This version turns out to be disappointing for much the same reason as the 1999 movie.1. Most of the characters in the movie don't resemble the characters in the book. Did the director ever read Mansfield Park?2. The story line has been completely changed. For instance, after refusing Mr. Crawford, Fannie doesn't go to visit her family. This is a major part of the story. Why on earth would they right this out of the plot?3. The acting seems lifeless.4. If you are fond of Jane Austen's work this version will make you mad. If you want to watch it, rent it before buying it.The original BBC production is still the best."
1,Disappointing,"I had high hope for this series and particularly this installment as I so love the book. Thusfar each of the first three episodes suffer from the impossibility of condensing a rich period novel into 90 minutes. There is no real chemistry between Edmund and Fanny--- and since there is so little time for any real character development that is crucial to making this piece work.The concept behind the series--- creating collection of Jane Austen films-- was wonderful. But why not full blown, authentic, quality productions instead of 90 minute tv movies?"
2,Not Realistic,"I had trouble looking at Fanny Price as a bleach-blond with dark eyebrows. Those features just don't go with the character in the book. Also, this actress looks hard when Fanny is supposed to be the picture of demure and delicate. I bought the DVD version so I could turn on the subtitles, but, even though they say they have them, subtitles are missing. Grrrrrr. I'm thinking these might be bootleg copies."
1,hm,"A rather dry and lifeless retelling of one of Jane's most sexually charged novels. The screen writer managed to purge all the wit and style out of the novel, leaving the lack luster cast to strole about the screen with no real sense of tension or connection."
2,Disappointing,This production suffers from being too short to fully develop the story and from poor decisions in casting and directing. Fanny is presented as a disheveled hoyden of no particular charm while Mrs. Norris is too pretty and too passive. Miss Austen would not recognize either as the women about whom she wrote. I had hoped for much better from BBC; Austen fans are still left without a top-notch film version of this book.
1,Don't even bother!,"As other reviewers have already said, this is Mansfield Park in name only. The movie cuts out so much of the story that nothing is left except to wait for Edmund to have his ah-ha moment, which fortunately doesn't take too long. Billie Piper does capture Fanny's sweetness, but the movie is so rushed that it doesn't really make much sense."
1,Please don't waste your time,"This production is awful and an embarrassment. It is far from accurate and, in addition to lacking important aspects of the book, truly lacks the tone and feeling of the book. Moreover the leading actress has little to do with Fanny Price as she is and looks and acts in the novel. Austen would have been seriously displeased."
2,terrible hair,"I prefer this Mansfield Park to the version with Frances O'Conner,I just hated that.This was definately intertaining and I found Fannie likeable,where as I didnt like the Frances O'Conner protrayal of Fannie.But OMG the hair,it truely was distracting and took away from the feeling of the era.What were they thinking......?All and all the movie I found watchable and intertaining although not very Jane Austenish.If you want to be slightly intertained and amused watch it,but dont take it to heart."
3,Faultless acting; faulty script,"Although this version of Mansfield Park was well acted, I don't think it delivered. The characters were not developed enough for my taste and that may be the fault of it being only 90 minutes long. Having been spoiled by 6 hour and 4 hour miniseries, such as ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""North and South,"" this version left something wanting. Although it is pleasant enough to watch, I wouldn't put it at the top of my ""must-buy"" list."
1,Jane Austen and Masterpiece Theatre fans beware,Like many Jane Austen fans I was excited at the prospect of this newer adaptation of Mansfield Park by Masterpeice Theatre. I had viewed Persuation and Northanger Abby and was pleased with these versions-although they should have been longer. However I was thoroughly disappointed with this version of Mansfield Park. Don't waste your time and money on this one.I suppose that Materpeice Theatre is allowed to produce a dud film once a season-just once please for the sake of your loyal viewers.
3,Entertaining But Not Good Enough,I have no idea why Masterpiece on PBS is giving us these truncated versions of Jane Austen's novels. There is no reason trying to adapt Austen's novel into a 90 minute movie. Too much is left out and there are hardly any psychological nuances touched upon among the characters. The cast of this version is very appealing but there is no enough dramatic buildup or tension. We will have to wait another few years for a definitive film version of Mansfield Park. Supposedly the best adaptation in this series is the new Sense and Sensibility and that is in two parts.
1,Skip this version,"Having seen the two previous adaptations of this book I was interested to see what kind of a treatment this book would get. Needless to say I was absolutely shocked to see how Fanny's character had changed. For those who say the writers didn't read the book...they did. I watched a behind the scenes of the entire project and what the director and writer had to say about Fanny was that she was really boring in the book. One of them said something about the character that got bleeped out. Here's what they missed Fanny may be scared of her own shadow, but she is the moral compass of the group. Personally I think while it was a rather ambitious project to have all five new adaptations out last year...I would have rather waited and have Andrew Davis be the one doing the screenplay for all of them. At least he stays true to the story."
4,Pleasntly Surprised,"I had just recently finished reading Manfield Park, by the great Jane Austen, when I started to look for film adaptions of it. When I came across this one, I read all the reviews (most of which were poor) and quickly went the other way. I first watched the 1999 version, it having better reviews, and I liked it quite a bit (aside from thinking ""Where is William?""). But, still curious, I came back to this version, having always liked the adaptions this group put out, and was astounded that it could recieve such bad reviews. I loved it. Some things are missing, if you are considering the book to be the supposed script. But, I thought it flowed very well even with those pieces missing. If you enjoy the book, you will most likely enjoy this movie. It is not word for word in line with the book, but there are many key quotes that make their way onto this film adaption of Mansfield Park. I recommend it."
2,Fanny? Where is Fanny?,"I read this book for the first time just before I saw the movie, so I mourned them ignoring the heroine Jane Austen wrote, and creating their own. The book made me cry for poor little Fanny, the movie made me violent toward bounding big ""Fanny.""I have tried to re-watch this movie many times, pretending Billy Piper is playing a different role than Fanny Price, but I cannot without grinding my teeth. Her hair, Louisa! Her dress! Three inches deep in the bust, I'm sure of it!Also I did not read Edmund as being this spineless and ... insipid. I watch him in this and want to yell, ""Stop being such a wimp!"" I like him much better in the previous version (though not a version I like either).This movie is Snoresville and too many liberties with history and Jane's wonderful work were taken for it to be good."
4,Classic,"Austen, of course it has to be a classic. Add Billie Piper, can't go wrong. Love it. It had been a long time since I had read the book, so was really excited to get this one."
1,They Should Have Read the Book...,If the directors had actually read the book and not just copied word for word the script of the other movie - it might have been a good and different adaption. The acting in this movie was also very poor. I would stick with the 1900s version.
2,What were they thinking?,"Why Billie Piper? There are so many gifted actresses who would have made this role believable. Blake Ritson is new to me, but I really enjoyed him as Edmund. But how to get past the glaring miscast of Billie Piper? What were they thinking?I own and enjoy the version from the 1980's starring someone with the improbable name of Sylvestra LaTouzel. She's just right, in my opinion."
2,Bad cinematography,"Like so many have said before, I bought this movie sight unseen with high expectations of finally having a good version of Mansfield Park, but instead was horribly disappointed. I won't go into the bad hair or missing scenes, because that's all been covered, however I will mention the bad camera work. It had to of been hand held, it jumped all over, why on earth didn't they use a steadycam? It made the film look bad! When it was steady, the shots were done so awkwardly; the angles were wrong and close ups were used when it would have been better to have a wider angle. I noticed the camera work was practically the same with Persuasion. I don't know what Masterpiece Theatre was thinking, I know they can do better."
2,Too Different from Novel,"I saw this version on PBS before I read the novel. I bought it to complete my Jane Austen collection. Although it's well done, it's too far from the novel and if I would've read the novel first, I wouldn't have bought it. It's a feel good movie, but it isn't Austen."
4,Billie Piper,"I think this is the sencond DVD that I ordered in error. I like Billie Piper the ""Fanny"""
5,Good deal,"Had trouble finding these locally, so was happy to find them here. Probably more than we'll need in the long-run, but it's still a good deal."
5,Fresh and talented execution,I listen part of this disk on Juan Gabriel's Web site and I liked very much. So I decided to buy and when I listen all the tracks I discovered that he is a really talented musician. I also found the web site of the author ... with some other examples... Amazon should have some other albums here... It is really good music.
1,A SCAM!,Beny More is wonderful. To represent him like this is fraudulent and disgraceful! This is the worst cobbled-together piece of drivel. Don't let the cover fool you. This is poppy/remix garbage. THERE ARE SO MANY BETTER ALBUMS FROM MORE OUT THERE. Buy one of them instead!
2,REDESIIGN IS A MISTAKE,I OWNED A RETRACTABLE DRYER FOR 10 YEARS WITHOUT A PROBLEM. I EVEN INSTALED AN INLINE PULLY THAT ENALED ME TO DOULE THE DRYERS USE ON A SMALL TERRACE. THE NEW DESIGN INSTALLED THE ROUND TIE OFF ON THE MOUNTING BRACKET RATHER THEN ON THE DRYER ITSELF. NOW IT TAKES FOREVER TO POSITION THE LINE SO THAT IT HOLDS TAUGHT.THIS IS UNFORTUNATE CHANG TO A GRAT PRODUCT. I JUST HOPE IT DOESN'T LAST AS LONG AS THE LAST ONE.PAT
3,Household Essentials 40' Retractable Dryer,"Household Essentials 40' Retractable Dryer - Well made with a good metal support bracket. Chord is Vinal coated and is strong enough for my use. If reeled up after use, should not crack and break down in the sunlight with normal use. Possibly some protectant would keep it pliable. Reels in slowly at end of line."
4,not bad,Well as you all know czw is known 4 its ultraviolent action.This dvd is no exception.This dvd features extremely brutal matches which is what you would expect from an ultraviolent company.Unfortunently it has extremely bad quality.It is still a great dvd for hardcore lovers out there like myself.Czw should put out more dvds because they are the most hardcore wrestling promotion that ive ever seen. This dvd will not let you down.Buy it!!!!!!
3,Will not fit Dodge Ram 1500,"The holder is not wide enough to fit in my 2011 Dodge Ram 1500 window. Can get them to go on, but they pop back off. Trying to figure out a way to make them work."
1,Biased Book about Media Bias,"Media Bias & the theft of the '92 election is the supposed topic of this book, which interested me enormously. Unfortunately, the book only works if you're so anti-Clinton that you blindly agree with the biased view of the authors. The so-called ""facts"" and ""figures"" are indeed numerous, and meant to beat you into bleary-eyed submission. I don't doubt there's a great book to be written on media bias & politics, and I thought that's what I was buying here. But it's just standard Clinton-bashing, with selective research and shoddy leaden prose as well. I'd love to see a companion volume by the same crew on the 2000 election, and compare their reporting. But if you just want to rant & rave like an uneducated toddler, this will probably make a tasty pacifier. Otherwise, I'd say save your money."
4,Stripped Down Sound,"""B Sides and Confessions"" is a very appropriate title for Jeff Black's latest album, for depite being a collection of new material, it has the bare, stripped down feel more often associated with demo recordings. That doesn't mean, however, that it isn't any good. In fact, Black may well be one of the best artists walking the singer-songwriter beat these days. The accoustic sound suits his voice and his style very well.The highlights on the album include the sweet ""To Be With You,"" the catchy ""Gold Heart Lockett,"" the angry rant ""Bastard"" and the lengthy closer ""Higher Ground."" The album is short only an additional catchy hook or two of being in true five star territory. Otherwise, it ranks with Patty Griffin's ""1000 Kisses"" as one of the best singer-songwriter albums of this past year."
4,Party Deluxe!,"A resplendent 28-song collection by a unique and versatile '60's British rock band, ""Viva Equals"" holds plenty of clever, three-chord slammers guaranteed to galvinize a party. Yes, this is Eddy Grant's old band, but the surprize is Derv Gordon's whiskey-throated lead vocals--righteous!"
5,Multifaceted web of connections,"Stillbird is a multifaceted web of connections. As we watch one generation to the next, the effects of one evil deed washes across several families and numerous communities. Sanchez has done a frighteningly wonderful job of showing how the past is rarely truly gone as events ripple through time.The writing is subtle but the message comes through loud and clear. This is a work that makes you think as you feel the characters' pain. A must-read for those interested in the effects of sexual abuse on resulting generations and fans of compelling writing!"
2,Visually beautiful + Some substances in the plot but overall it's not good..,"The copy I bought was titled ""Joongcheon"" with English subtitle. It's visually beautiful. It also has some substances in the plot but overall it's not a good movie. It's because relationship between the 2 main characters are not touching at all. The fighting scenes are not good as in other Korean-made movies such as ""Shadowless Sword"" or ""Warrior"".It's worth watching once."
5,One of the greatest fight scenes ever done,"The last Battle of this spiritually powerful Martial EPIC has the hero taking on a literal army of dark spirit-demons to reach the one he loves. The emotion of this film in the manner that the characters interact MAKES THE MOVIE outstanding. That awesome last battle makes you believe one man alone can stand for something higher against staggering odds....and prevail. The Restless is, hands down for plot, martial skill and special effects one of the greatest Action films of all time."
4,Trails from Railbeds,"This book made me immediately drive to the Smokies and search out the many logging camps described in great detail. Bill Hooks makes this book a ""must have"" for the Smoky Mountain Hiker types. The information on the ancient town of Elkmont was fantastic. I will be using this book along with my trail maps to find the many 'turn-of-the-century' archaeological spots tucked away in the National Park."
4,Good Basic History,"This is the only book I've found that covers the history of the LRL Co and the LRRR. It's what I would describe as a basic history and not an in-depth overly detailed history. Maps could use some improvement. Would like to have seen more old photos and fewer line drawings and sketches.The price I paid was $36.95. On the back of the book it had a price tag of $22.50. In this case FREE SHIPPING didn't mean much. Still, I'd purchase the book again."
2,Luma Lighted Tweezer Review,"The light was very good, the magnifier (very tiny) made of plastic which was optically difficult to look thru if you already wear glasses. But the worst part were the tweezers in themselves. They were difficult to squeeze togeter because of their placement on the handle. Also, I am used to sharp tweezers that come together tightly over the hair. These did not. So they do not tweeze well at all. Wasn't worth all the bother of a return. I just threw it away. It was a good idea for a product, just poorly made."
2,Luma Tweeze Review,This product may be good for something but it is not good for plucking your own face. I was very disapointed in it. The tweezers were hard to push together. The light was too narrow to be helpful. The product was hard to position is a way that the magnifier could be used. I tried to use it several times and always got frustrated.
4,great book for new music students,"i found this book easy to understand, and quite detailed. Its a great book for beginers who'd like a lil history to music. Recommend to buy the cd's rather than the tapes that comes with it."
1,Do not waste your time or money...,Gamesharks from the first one have been totally worthless and this one is no exception. They screw up the data on the games (saved games etc). They screw up the game itself (missing levels etc). They are overpriced and gameshark doesn't release half the codes they find. They can even screw up your whole system and even if they don't they make it so the system will lock up if it is moved at all. DO NOT buy this you will be very sorry you did.
1,Gameshark doesn't work!?!,"I agree with the other reviewer that says that it doesn't work. I put it in and keeps saying that the gameshark is not detected. If you want to take a chance and buy this thing off ......, be careful."
1,Got jynxed,ok firt the first one i had didnt work it would tell me to insert a PS1 or PS2 disc format. we took that one back an exchanged it for another one and that one told me the same thing. so we just took that one back for our money back.
3,Not The Best...,"OK now, I liked this alot! And it helped me get past this part on Final Fantasy 10. And well it did last for about five months or something like that. Now its a reck! It wont play now! It freezes up! I hate it. Now I think its in my closet. So dont buy this! Uhh...thats all I want to say."
3,gameshark getting old,ive been reading reviews on how bad this product is i bought my game shark when it was new and it was great had some codes that ar max and codebreaker had only problem with these products with online update is after they become old the companies no longer support the software and move on due to the new systems coming out another problem is game shaks that were made by interact are no longer supported to online updates since madcatz now releases game shark so updating your old versions is no longer available the info is on there website in the support section tab i hope this review helps
3,bittersweet,"stuck on several games, i bought one of the first versions of the Game Shark 2...) only to find out Interact [messed] up and you then had to order an updated disc + S & H ...I hear it's since been repackaged but it still [stinks] they released an unusable product and then screwed you for their mistake...otherwise the codes are still hit or miss depending of the release version of your PS2 and/or the game...but codes are always being updated on their website...if you can't beat a game...it's a solution...otherwise save your $...towards a new game..."
2,Buy The Code Breaker,"The Gameshark 2 only for a year. The first few months its ok, but than it has a hard time reading the GS2 memory card, a.k.a. the bungle. It freezes after you save a code. Finally the bungle damages your memory card port. This is not worth your money. I recommend the codebreaker instead. It doesn't come with the special memory card, but it way better and more reliable. It can also use your favorite GS2 codes. You can save codes on your regular PS2 memory card. For info on the codebreaker visit cmgsccc.com. For info on the gameshark 2 visit gameshark.com"
2,Get Gamshark Version 3,"I will start off by saying that, when it works, the Gameshark is VERY cool. However there have been many times that a game wouldnt load when I was trying to use Gameshark codes on it. (I have version2) Then, there is the question about why version 3 codes wont work for version 2 (as posted by a previous reviewer) The problem occured when MadCatz bought Gameshark, the previous owners retained the rights to the first two versions. Basically making it illegal for MadCatz to create new version 1 & 2 codes. Long story short: if you get a Gameshark, be sure it is a version 3 by MadCatz. While I dont think this is a good excuse, it is the reason."
1,Piece of junk!,DO NOT BUY THIS!!! My first gameshark died after having it for three months. The code screen just scrambled up and you can't read any thing intelligable. On top of that it won't save anything if you enter in a new code. Interact refuses to fix it. A friend of mine just got a extra one and gave it to me. It worked for four days before the thing died. SAVE YOUR MONEY! I know some games are frustrating but it's better trying to finish them on your own rather than buy this piece of junk that will probably die on you in a week.
1,HELLO! EARTH TO GAMESHARK!,"Let me just say this once...RIP OFF! Games can be hard at some points, and its sometimes hard to get the most coolest weapons, items, etc. Well, O.K. but, thats why there are strategy guides. Gameshark gave me alot of codes to get my HP and MP higher, also weapons, items, and I finally killed Evrae on Final Fantasy 10. But listen to this, I had this game shark for about 5 to 6 months and yeah that does seem along time but...1.) I put the gameshark disc into the PS22.) It started to load...then said DISC READ ERRORAfter that I took the disc, cleaned it and the PS2 but still didn't work after that.SAVE YOU MULA ON SOMETHING ELSE THAT W O R K S for your lifetime!Oh, excuse me I left something else... it ERASED my important battle skills and my peoples HP. And when I tried to beat this one boss, it had more HP then its suppose to be. Like the bosses HP was suppose to be 100,000 when it turned the HP into MAYBE atleast a million!"
2,wellllllllll,"It has helped alot but I have gotten 4 errors before.sllowage, drain, unbalenceness, and stalling.BUT, when I was toggling with the system I put the speed & proformance (quality) to high and changed the version to 9.0.and I haven't had a problem since.If you don't know how to do this I suggest you don't buy a gameshark 2."
1,good your ps2 is just geting mest up,i live here in the uk and i own about every single syestem there is i have the game shark for the most of them it is not the game shark it is your ps2 you ps2 is dieing not becaues of the game shark. in the states the ps2 dies in about 6 years but starts dieing after the thread year or if if you lucky and play it 24/7 it will die in 3 years
1,AWFUL!,Gameshark 2 is Awful. More than half the time you use it it will not read the disc. You have to replace it like every year so that it might work better!
3,Gameshark 2 for PS2,"This is a really cool product for those who like to play through a game without having to worry about dying and having to replay an entire section. Its also a great tool for getting past very challenging parts of a game. The only drawbacks for this item is the fact that some of the newer games` codes might not work.I retrieved some codes for a fairly new game and took the time to input them manually, only to find out that the codes didnt actually work. Very disappointing. Other than that, this item is fun to use."
1,DO NOT BUY!,DO NOT buy any type of gameshark! I will tell you what happaned to it. I wanted to get some cheats for my Final Fantasy 10. So I found this on amazon and wanted to buy it. I couldnt wait so I could defeat this guy on here. So it came and it worked for a couple of weeks and then later on it said disc read error! It got me mad thinking about it! It was NOT the PS2 it was the stupid gameshark. Wasted $19.00 . What a rip off. Just get some cheats or hints from the internet. Its called www.cheatplanet.com and THAT will solve your problem. Its not amazon's fault its the creator who made the gameshark!
2,This major bull...,"I have to say, since I have a Hih version PS2, my gameshark works well all the time, but hears the main flaw, I have a gameshark 2, and codes for the games I want only work on gameshark 3! Games like Splinter Cell(Which I really need codes for, badly), Xenosaga(So I can play it again, and have no trouble), and a lot of other games. This is major BS!! I brought this in december, now it's like a useless piece of garbage! Why can't I upgrade this or something?! Well one things for sure, I'm not spending another 40 bux for another gameshark, just to play my new games. I'd rather beat it on my own. If you don't have a gameshark, and need one, get version3, but then they'll screw you over in the future when version 4 comes out. Interact is just too greedy for their own good. Well, their not getting their grubby hands on my money for a long time, or maybe never."
2,Warning!,"You all may think that this is perfect, but it's not, Gameshark can mess up your Playstation 2. Much of the time it disables your Playstation 2's ability to read CD roms, it will only be able to read DVD roms, so great games like Tekken will be disabled on your Playstation 2. You have been warned. Actually it's not all bad, there are still some really good cheats that are available out there."
1,Gameshark-Overpriced and Useless,"I should've saved my $[money]for something more useful than this piece of garbage. It had lots of glitches (game codes would erase, gameshark wouldn't read slot 2 on my PS2), and even if these problems could be solved it would be a waste of time if you want codes for only a few games. Buy a Pelican PS2 Codebreaker instead; it's a product that actually works all the time when you use it."
5,GAMESHARK CRAZY,I just love this gamshark for my Playstation 2. It comes in great for games like Gran Turismo 3. This is bomb. It also has a disk for PS one games too. The only bad thing is that you have to spend eight bucks extra for the updated disk. oh well i think any gamer who gets tired of irritating levels should get this. its worth it. and hey its a great deal at this website too.I've seen this for 50 bucks at other websites and stores. get it from amazon.com
4,Waste of money,"I bought this thinking it would be similar to Game Shark for the PS1- it's not even close. Half the fun with the PS1 version was hacking into the game myself and developing my own codes. This version is dependent on the web site to get new codes. So if you like a game that isn't widely popular, you're out of luck. Save your money."
1,[Worthless],"So far I had 2 gamesharks, both of which were defective. However, I was lucky enough and my PS2 din't mess up, but if you do use this [terrible]peripheral you'll probably end up buying a new PS2.As far as the product itself it's ok, but it will mess up soon enough. So, if you want a cheating device, I'd suggest code breaker, it's better and has a better (and wider) variety of cheats, and if you can't find a cheat for that use one for the gameshark, and it will work!I am very dissapointed in Interact, I lost all faith in them....If you already have a gameshark go get your receipt and hold on to it, and when it breaks take your money back and go get the Codebreaker."
4,Well Worth It,"I have heard terrible stories about problems, but I have not found any issues. I am using version 2, that may make a difference, but so far I have had no problems with lock-ups, booting problems or any thing else. I recomend this highly."
2,What's going on here?????,"I got my Gameshark for Christmas 2001. And by March 2002 it had died on me. I've noticed a lot of other reviews saying that it's done the same thing to them. It must be a big scam. Oh, and the Playstation 1 disk that comes with it still does work."
1,Didn't work!,"The CD for the PS2 failed to work. I never got a menu screen--just a notice asking for a Playstation or Playstation 2 format disc. Gee, and here I thought the CD for GS2 WAS a PS2 format disc....Silly me."
1,Don't Waste Your Money-Buy codebreaker,"I used to think that the gs was the ultimate cheat device. I was dead wrong. Another cheat device called the ""code breaker"" is thousands of times better. The code breaker not only lets you use game shark codes but also enables the use of other codes! GS is payed off by game compaines to not release many codes!! and check out codes for phantasy star online. They only have one code! But if you check out underground sites they post many many more. The code breaker is only $30.00 and works better and does more. And the code breaker can be found here at amazon or many other mainstream videogame shops. End InterAct's reign of terror now dont limit your codes get codebreaker now!"
2,gameshark for playstation2,"this is no good to the latest playstation2. if you have just got a playstation2 the ps2 gameshark disk won't work. you will have to also get the upgrade disk ... . you do need the gameshark ""memory card"" thing to make the upgrade disk work. stuck between a rock and a hard place. well worth it other than you feel like you have been ripped off when you get it home and it doesn't work. then you can make it work if you are willing to spend just a little more money. the reason is the sony changed the format on newwer ps2 systems so the original ps2 gameshark disk won't work. that's why you need the upgrade disk. marketing you have got to love it."
1,PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"DO NOT BUY GAMESHARK 2, Five of my friends that have tried it in their PS2 have had fatal errors and sony will not help out, unless you fork out $120 bucks. It works for a good month then seriously messes up your PS2. My PS2 will not play non-dvd games or playstation 1 games anymore, some games that are non-dvd are madden 2002 and fifa 2001. It will only play dvd's and dvd rom games. SO I BEG YOU DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I'M WRITING TO THE COMPANY AS I WRITE THIS."
2,I'ts OK but..............,"Well, I'm only 80% sure of this thing. I am on my second one now and will have to go to a 3rd.It has it's good points. It does give you many options of what to do with your games. 10x the horse power, new items not in the game, or new players. I don't have the time to play the games as much as some gamers but wanted to get to some of the good parts. So using this it did help me get more out of games. When it is working it is great it gives you the things the codes say and you can save it. I had my first one work for a month and then it just contined to freeze when installed. I returned it for another one. It worked fine for about 6 months. In between this I bought a GamePort which you can download game saves from the site, other players on various sites, and other memory cards to your memory card. It is a little limiting but cool. ...Again when it works it works great."
2,I got it working... AFTER 2 MONTHS!,"Well after 1 last try I finally got this thing to work. Okay first off the info movie at the beginning isn;t as simple as that.Wheny ou enter your codes and try and play the ga, whenever I insert it, and press X nothing happens.I found out a complicated way on how tod o it, but it shouldn;t take me 2 months on how to figure out how to use this thing.Plus the technical support is c**p. They always say their open on some day and when I call them their open on some other day. Yeesh!Yeah sure ""THE BEST VIDEO GAME ENHANCER AROUND"" give me a break."
4,junk!!!,"Piece of cr#p isn't even good for target practice. it is riddled with bugs and it shouldn't even have left the factory. and i have a version 4. after 4 tries you think they could have gotten it right. well thats now 4 strikes and your out, i WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT FROM YOU AGAIN. also i own 2 madcatz controllers pure cr#p!!! i suggest you start a protest against all madcatz product because i think they are being made by the taliban or something, they suck!!!"
2,Lameshark2,"I havn't had much problems, but on the side that you have a 50% chance of it not working, Wait... there is a word for that, It's called a SCAM!You can't enter your own codes for the PS1 disc you have to buy a stupid upgrade disc that doesn't even have the codes you want!For example I have a code for Spyro the dragon to ""Fly instead of glide"" now I can't get that on my PS2 now can I?!?!? because I can't enter it in or get it on the upgrade disc!Save your PS1 GS it is 100 times better!"
1,GAMESHARK IS AWEFUL!,"I only gave it one star because I couldn't go any lower. The gameshark for PS2 has way to many bugs in it. When I first got it, it took about 50 tries to get it to work once and when I entered my codes it froze. Then, after trying again it worked, or so I thought. It deleted my memory card and even after I just decided to start a new game my system overheated. If you want to cheat, buy a Codebreaker. They save codes onto your original memory card and they don't take up very much room. After saving over 500 codes it only took up 100KB's of space. They can even use Gameshark codes. I have never had a problem with it and will continue to use it."
3,Listen Up,"I got the gameshark for my PS2... my PS2 was working fine until I stuck this thing in here. Go to websites to get cheats... almost as good. I don't care what anyone says. This thing is NOT good for your systems. I spoke to a professional and he said the reason my PS2 stopped working was probably becuase of the Gameshark.... there could be no other reason... beside the fact that it is a poorly manufactured system (which I seem to disagree with).Take a risk and this is still good to have. If you're lucky, it might not wreck your system. Look into it before buying it.Anyway... to review it:It has all of the cheats known to man. It is really cool, but remember the risk.Good luck..."
2,Faulty Hardware,"I got the game shark when it was nearly brand new to the market. I was very excited to use it, but the first time I went to turn it on, and look for the ""pre-loaded"" codes, I could'nt find any. This was very disapointing, the codes were not there. I don't know if all of them had this glitch or if it was just mine, but its not somthing that I would put past Interact Acc.,. When they first released PS2, there was only a DVD remote control on the market by Interact. That contorler had a glitch and was recalled. The replacment worked OK, but the Sony remote was much better. I do not have Pelicans version, but others say that it is a better alt."
3,OK for accuracy,It works fairly accurately as long as the vehicle is in open area. Tends to lose its way when passing through bridges. Light stopped working almost immediately
5,We have raised 5 boys and this is the book we always turn to,"Skousen truely knows what boys do. We have had So You Want To Raise A Boy on our shelves for over 20 years and refer to it regularly. When times are tough and I can't figure things out with my son, I go to ""The Book"" and Skousen helps me understand the characteristics of my son at his particular stage of development.Year by year he tells me about the traits and characteristics of a baby, boy and then a young man. His advice is right on and has made our life much better.Four are grown and beginning families of their own and we are still good friends."
5,Best racing game on the Super Nintendo,"This is quite possibly the best racing game on the Super NintendoUnlike most Super Nintendo Racing games, when you press left or right, you simply go in that direction. It controls much better than F-Zero or Mario Kart.The graphics are colorful and they have a lot of charm. Plus, this uses Sprite Scaling instead of Mode 7, so it's a lot easier on your eyes than most Racing games on the Super Nintendo.The game itself is basically a Lotus Turbo Challenge game (also by Gremlin Graphics) for the Super Nintendo. As a result, most of the music is from the Lotus Turbo Challenge games for the Amiga. A lot of these songs sound EVEN BETTER (Something I thought was impossible)!Overall, if you want a REALLY good racing game, this is one you should pick up!"
1,amazingly crooked,"Heard it was good so I ordered it. Got a great deal at 539.20, but miraculously when they processed my bank # it wouldn't go thru.No problem just reorder they said. So I tried. In one day the saw went from 539.20 to 799. Oh yeah and now is uneligable for free shipping. Sounds alot like the old car lot bait and switch act.F*** amazon .com"
3,rush to market,"I believe this is going to be a good saw for my purposes, but am at this point in time fairly fed up with set up difficulties. The factory settings for the blade alignment were 3/64ths out of whack (which is more than enough to make a new premium blade perform like one with no edge at all) and the instructions for correcting it are lacking at best. The manual pretty much says that it is difficult and time consuming and have fun. I have several screws that are not mentioned in the manual and am missing some that are. I am also rather disappointed that as of yet, there are no zero clearance inserts available for this model from anyone.What we probably have is a new product that was rushed to market and there are still a few bugs to be worked out. I just hate being to one to work them out. I just want to build some stuff. I expected more from Delta."
4,How the Garcia Girls Lost Thier Accents,"""How the Garcia Girls Lost Thier Accents,"" was a very enjoyable novel that was easy to read. The story was about four daughters (Carla, Sandi, Yolanda, and Sofia) and their parents who lived in the Dominican and moved to the United States. The story showed how each of the daughters changed and dealt with the adjustments of moving to a different country. It also shows how the parents raised their children, while trying to keep thier original culture instilled in them. The novel moves from back and forth in time allowing the reader to understand their lifestyle throughtout time. Each daughter had a unique personality, and the parent's had stories about each daughther that helped to describe them as individuals."
4,Worth Your Time!,"How the Garcia Girls Lost their Accents was an extremely enjoyable read. While being quite entertaining, it also gave an excellent insight to traditional life in the Dominican Republic. The novel thoroughly delves into the controversial matter of being raised an extremely patriarchal society, adjusting to a more liberal one later in life, and difficulties one encounters when returning to his or her homeland. The reverse chronology the author used was primarily a bit hard to grasp, but became more natural as it progressed. When one usually reads a novel, he or she is always waiting to turn to the next page to see what will happen next, but here, the urge comes from the stylistic writing and intriguing character development. Overall, this novel is a fascinating analysis of what modern-day immigrants experience upon transplanting themselves to a new place and culture. Julia Alvarez has done a wonderful job with this educational yet delightfully fun piece of literature."
5,Required reading for writers,"Anyone aspiring to be a writer should read this book. I read it as a requirement for a creative writing class and was pleasantly surprised by how much I really enjoyed it. Alvarez has a unigue style that is simple, yet subtle and powerful, obvious and opaque. Definitely a good read and a good source for literary techniques."
4,Relating to the Garcia Girls,"In my own analysis of How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents I would first off like to say its brilliantly written, and has just enough humor to keep the book from getting old. This book is perfect for any teenage girl, especially one of Hispanic culture. The Garcia girls let you into their world. In each of their adventures you can on some level relate. The way the book is written from present to past is a amiable way of writing this story. Knowing how the girls turn out in their lives then retracing step by step how they got to that point is fulfilling. Having a different person narrate each chapter is a way to find out more about each individual character and how they look at things. Complying with the Garcia family and their struggle to be ""normal"" in this new culture is part of what makesthe book so genuine. Alvarez uses great detail in helping you to feel as though your in the exact setting as the characters. Overall it was an excellent book. I give it a 4!"
1,How the Garcia Girls lost their Accents,This book was confusing and vague with seeminly little purpose and a low grasp on reality. It starts in the future with Yolands in the DR and follows her and her sister's trail back into how they came to the US. It does not highlight enough the adolescence rebellion that most immigrants have with their parents and it also is just not very intresting. I do not recomend this book.
2,Misrepresented,"Perhaps this is a story of sisterhood or identifiable more to a female reader, but in no way can these be represented as indicative of the experiences shared by Hispanic immigrants to the United States and specifically those from the Dominican Republic. Coming from a Dominican family that made this transition at approximately the same time (c. 1960) I was intrigued by this book but found it hollow; barely scratching the surface of the fears facing displaced children and extremely shallow in regards to the conflict Latin women faced (and still face) within the context of their own society let alone adjusting to a new one. Moreover, portraying the privileged Garcia family, albeit victim of sinister political intrigue, as representative of Dominican immigrants is insulting to the majority of hard working peasants that came here simply to be able to provide food and educations for their children. Certainly, the author's intentions are noble, but the results are thin and off the mark."
3,"Nice Read, Interesting Format","I was recommended this book after I read ""The Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing."" I liked the beginning and I found it interesting how the author switched the plot so the beginning started at the end and worked its way back to when the girls were still in the Dominican. This technique reminded me of the movie called ""Momento."" However, this technique did not work with the book, because after the climax I felt like I had to slog through the rest of the material to get to the abrupt ending. I liked the author's use of imagery in her prose, because I could imagine myself being in the Dominican with the family. I also liked the well developed characters, although I do not have a particular favourite. Some of the stories are quite cute and others are more serious. This is a very interesting author, because she's willing to experiment and take chances and for that I applaud her courage and I am eager to see her develop into great author."
3,One-sided,"This story starts with some brilliant dialogue and sensative treatment of the early years, viz.,a longing to be accepted in their new country (aided, but not as much as they had hoped, by their European features).Initally I thought her treatment of Haitians was cold, showing them as a people locked in santeria and a willingness to do nothing but be 20th century slaves. Then I considered how locked forever the author was in her own Master/Slave attitudes (see Gilberto Freire) I accepted that. Also, after Papa and Baby Doc Duvalier, who did nothing to advance the Island's economic development, how could I really fault The Dominican Republic. DR has its own legacy of racial abiguity and overall desire to fit in. Who knows, the next Nobel Prize winner in Physics may come from Hispanola! And if she does, I would she would have something nice to say about her grandmother in the kitchen."
3,definately mixed feelings on this one,"Although the writing was excellant, I had some problems with this one. First of all, I didn't like starting in the present and moving backward in time. Also the stories themselves seemed rather disconnected and contrived at times. It seemed to me to be more of a collection of connected short stories rather than a novel. Overall I guess it worked but not as well as it might have.Much of the writing was first rate and many of the stories were excellant. I guess it all depends on what the reader prefers."
2,Disappointing book,"I have just finished reading this book and felt compelled to submit a review because it was so disappointing. The ending of the book is so hurried that one feels like an unwanted guest being shown the door. And when the door shuts behind you, all you can say is ""IS THAT IT?"" The author never really develops the characters and what could have potentially been a wonderful plot is just a series of brief glimpses into the Garcia family at different stages of their lives. Very unstatisfying, particularly given that there are ""so many books..so little time."" If this is representative of the author's work in general, you can be sure that I will not be reading any of her other novels."
2,I did not enjoy this book much at all,"There were a couple of chapters that I enjoyed and found humorous but the rest of the book was not very good, in my opinion. I didn't like the reverse chronological order of the stories. I don't think it added to the book in any way, in fact I think it made it worse. I finished this book and wondered what the point of it all was."
3,How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents,"This story to me was a little confusing at first because the stories are going backwards chronological order, but I got used to it and it was easier to understand once I knew that. This story is about a family from the Dominican that were forced to move to New York. The book tells many stories of how the four daughters adapted to the American culture, but still kept a part of Dominican with them. One distinct characteristic from all of them was their morals as woman. As you read, you learn about their many hardships growing up in a new culture, being made fun of, and not accepted. While each of them are trying to find their own identity, we also notice how they seem to become more ""American"" and less ""Dominican"" as they get older. I found this book very interesting learning about their lives and what it is like living in the United States as an immigrant."
2,Not Great,I had to read a multicultural book for my ninth grade English class. The librarian told me to read this book because other students had loved it. So I read it and I didn't like it pretty much at all. The book is very confusing becuase it goes back in time especially when they are in there home country it's confusing to understand it. When they were in the USA it was okay but could have been better. I wanted to quit reading it but I couldn't but I did not enjoy reading it at all. I wouldn't reccomemd this book to anyone to read.
4,How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accent,This is a great book to see how a culture influences ones identity. The author paints an elaborate picture of family and culture. Excellent and easy read.
2,Fair to poor read.,Did not hold my interest. Jumped from one character to another. Could have been written in less chapters and still delivered the point of the story. I was disappointed.
5,Great Read,Great summer time read or any time for that matter and I recommend to young and alike. Good for your time!
3,"Alright, not great","This book is pretty good. I did like the way it was told in reverse chronological order. Each short vignette was interesting but they didn't really seem to fit together much at all. The book is more like a collection of short stories, which is fine if that is what you're looking for. As one novel though, I kept waiting for something exciting to happen or some sort of climax but it never really came. Each chapter held my interest, but I wish the whole novel had been a bit more cohesive."
2,Too slow for me,"This was the first book I read by Julia Alvarez, it was not as good or exciting as I expected. It dragged in the beginning. It took over 100 pages to get interesting and it's not a long book. I bought another book by her at the same time don't feel like even reading it."
2,Stephanie (CURIE STUDENT),"The four Garcia sisters, Carla, Sandra, Yolanda and Sofia, enjoyed a fairly sheltered and luxurious childhood in the Dominican Republic. When their father, Carlos, got in trouble with the police for agitating against the military dictatorship, the family was forced out of the country. Now they have to move to America (New York). The sisters now have to change their language because they don't want to have the same accent they had when they were living in their country.To me i didnt like this book alot because the sister's had to go through alot of obstacles to change their life's just to fit into a new county."
3,Not a Fan,"I have read half this book and am having trouble reading the rest because the author is all over the place. It is an interesting novel but I just prefer a different style. It was chosen for a book club, I am more a fan of the sci fi and fantasy."
5,Delightful & Entertaining*,"The book, ""How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents,"" is a tremendous book. It is very comical, yet has some heart to heart moments. The story is one that you can relate to your family and find something from almost every character that relates to your life in some way. I enjoyed reading of the four sisters different adventures and how they were all very different but could come together and seem like they were the same person. It shows truths such as the fact that no family is perfect and has flaws. The parents of the story were very interesting as to you could see how important family was to them. They took pride in everything. This story was adventurous and very humorous. Definitely an enjoyable book!"
2,Had me there for a few chapters,"The book started off at an etremely slow pace, and builds up some emotion for the character Yolanda, a depressed young woman who can't find her niche in society,then too often jumps back in forth between the other sisters. We don't learn anything really about the other sisters, and if we do its a paragraph or two.The author can't hit our emotions with the other characters and the ideas seem a bit contrived and unorganized. The last five chapters are a complete bore. I was dissapointed extremely because the book peeked WAY too soon."
1,Waste of time,"Our book club chose this book, because it sounded intriguing and had great reviews. What a waste of time...A compilation of short vignettes is a great idea...but unfortunately, this collection went no where. The characters were dull, and the stories had no depth or interconnection.I thought I was the only one who felt this way about this boring book until our group met. Half of them didn't even finish it. We all agreed it was a bad choice, and wondered WHO in the heck could give it five stars???"
3,just okay,"I was hoping for more out of this book. This is the first I have read by Julia Alvarez, and I doubt I will read another by her. It just did not grab me and pull me in. I did not feel much of a connection the characters. It was simply a relaxing read, and nothing more."
2,"Frankly, I don't care how the Garcia girls lost their accents","I chose not to finish reading the book. I really liked ""Finding Miracles"" and was looking forward to another novel by Ms. Alvarez. I like to read cultural or time-period novels, I like to read of others' experiences and backgrounds, however- for me, I just didn't care about these people. Maybe I am naive, but these are lifestyles for which I had no appreciation (maybe I lack understanding). I wanted more of a description of life and culture, not poor choices, poor language and poor examples. I tried to plug along, but I will find another Alvarez to read.I hate to think this would be on anyone's high school reading list. This is not for teenager's consumption."
4,Very etertaining,"I was very impressed with this book. It is about the 4 de la Torre girls who talk about their experiences with their family and the United States. The gilrs were sent to the United States for school and there they had to deal with prejudice and trying to live in in both the US culture and their home culture. The girls would spendd the school year in the States and the summer back home on the island with their cousins. Instead of starting from when the girls were younger, it starts out in the present and works it's way backward in time. At first this type of format seemed odd to me, but you read about what they are doing as adults and find out later why they turned out the way they did. During the entire book, I was engrossed in the story because Alvarez does a very excellent job of describing the family. I really enjoyed this book."
5,De otra manera,"Resulta grandioso ver como J. Alvarez logra adentrarnos en lo magico que guarda cada nucleo familiar, en sus verdaderas historias, en las que todos y todas nos reflejamos de alguna manera; es poderosa la fuerza de sus palabras y el sentimiento compartido de educacion en dos culturas. definitivamente sienta un precedente como parte de la nueva literatura hispano-americana."
2,Good concept...lousy execution.,"Julia Alvarez tries so hard to make us understand the Garcia family, through the experiences of Yolanda(who is the best of the Garcias), Sofia, Sandra and Carla. She starts in the present with Yolanda or ""Yo"" exploring the island her family had to flee. Then the stories move back in time, and all are either too short, or spoil the mood by making you hate the characters. Alvarez does try to tell us the truth about the Domincan republic and the immigration experience, but writes a medicre series of stories instead."
2,Surprising disappointment,"I did not enjoy this book. The reverse order of chapters was confusing and unnecessary: more than once, the author mentions an event and then tells the entire story many chapters later. It was hard to keep track, and distracted from the story as a whole. My biggest gripe is that I didn't care for the sisters that much, I could barely tell them apart! They sounded the same, and I simply didn't get drawn into their lives and heads the way I hoped I would. The political events were interesting, and the social order in the Dominican Republic was a surprise to me, so I did learn something. However, the novel didn't flow for me and didn't hold my interest."
5,"wonderful, and delightful piece of work",the novel was set up in a backtrack type of way. the way ms. alvarez set up the book was wonderful and deserves all the praises.
1,Does it get any better,I am 1/3 of the way through this book and I am stalled -- I have read 2 other books since starting this work. It just isn't a rewarding experience for me. There is no driving beat in the book to drive me on.
3,Bititas Diary,Bitias Diary is a very interesting book. This book is categorized as a testimonial so it is very interesting to see how this girl grows into a woman and the challenges she goes through. Bitia is an African American child in 1915. She later in her childhood becomes educated. Through out her childhood she is not seen as a normal girl. She asks a lot of questions and demands respect from white kids. As a woman she goes to different houses and cleans to make a living. At one point she was working at a convent. She ended up leaving to find her self and to act her age as a young adult not wanting to be grown up yet. This book gives the reader a good idea of what African Americans at that time went through and the challenges that she went through can be generalized to all people.
4,Thoroughly enjoyed this story,The story was excellent. It begins in the present and works itself backwards. With every chapter you finish you learn more about how the characters lives were shaped. A must read!
5,Lost Accents...Found Selves,"This book is a completely readable amazing exploration of a family, it's journey to the USA, and its impact on all (especially one) of the daughters. I read this book on the heels of a book in which the author knew everything about why the characters did what they did but didn't bother to explain to the readers. This book completely made up for that by completely recounting the events. It starts at the present and makes a trek back in time stopping at high and low points in the Garcia Girls' lives. Eventhough I have lived in the USA all my life and am not of Hispanic origin, I completely identified with the Garcia Girls' experience. This book was a joy to read and one that I will quote from for a long long time."
3,Merging into a different culture,"This book presents the experiences of four hispanic sisters as they try to adapt to life in the United States. They soon realize much of what they knew and believed is no longer existent. Since the book is divided in several small stories that go from present time to the past, it does not really provide a clear picture of the different characters. The message is nonetheless conveyed, as one can integrate and recognize the experiences of the sisters as those of the hispanic collective in the States."
4,It's worth your time,"I read, ""How the Garcia Girls lost their accents"" for my "" Women of Latin America"" class. This book was very interesting. This book is nothing like anything that I have read before, but I was still able to gain something from reading it. This is a wonderful story of how the Garcia de la Torre girls acclimate themselves to a new way of life when they are abruptly uprooted from their home. The United States and its culture are difficult for the girls to understand. The book takes us in to their lives and tells of the trials and tribulations of starting over. The best thing about this book is how the author is able to write the girls so accurately. I have two sisters, and I felt as if the things that the Garcia girls did were things that I can remember, or picture my sisters and I doing. The book is very easy reading and it is worth your time."
2,Tries Too Hard,"How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents by Julia Alvarez certainly does give one an accurate idea of a Latin-American family. I feel that that is the only benefit of this book. This book is categorized as young adult, but there are many sexual situations as well as multiple expletives. I also feel that the author tries too hard to sound different and interesting. Many of her descriptions are forced and out of place. While I don't feel that this is a worthwhile read, it does give one a better understanding of a different culture."
3,So much racism,"I read Alvarez's In the Time of the Butterflies and I loved it! So, I decided to buy How the Garcia Girls lost their accents and it is far from what I expected. I have never read a book that had so much hate towards a race. As most people may know, Haiti and The Dominican Republic aka Hispanola share the same island. DR use to be run by a bad Haitian ruler and then by an evil dominican dictator Trujillo. In the book the family had a maid who was Haitian and the other maids despised her because she was dark skinned instead of fair skinned like the rest. Trujillo had ordered the execution of all BLACK HAITIANS on their side of the island to be murdered by dawn. They hid a Haitian girl and she became their maid. Maid or slave I ask? Then, a family member had stated pity for her, she won't get that far with that skin. Not interested in YO YO!"
3,Let me save you some time...,"Read from page 24-191 the rest isnt worth it.The ending is just boring and confusing, all you need to know is that the father gets in trouble with the government and they have to move to New York. Thats it."
2,How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents,"I did not care for this book at all. To me it was boring at best. It was a book club selection, and not one of their best to say the least."
3,I dunno about this book,"Well.... I read this book as a indidviual choose in my Honors English class.... I was really disappointed in how the book ended. I think that the most irritating thing was that I hated was just ending with a pointless story that didnt even end the book. I guess I was looking for more closure to this book that was so strongly opioniated towards the american race and religion. At the beginning of the book; the stories were really grabbing my attention. Then as the story progressed, the stories went back to when they were younger and confused me on what the story was actually striving for."
4,How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents,"The Garcia Girls was a very interesting book. It tells the story of four girls along with their parents that move from the Dominican Republic to the United States. The transition brings along heartache and happiness. The story compares and evaluates the two countries and their way of life. The story discusses issues faced by families that immigrate and the adjustments that become necessary. The family goes through changes and face uncertainties in this new land. The girls search for their identity, endure name- calling/stereotypes, and explore their new world living in the states. Assimilation,dissimilation, and transculturation are all present in the novel. The fear of lost identity overcomes their parents as the girls compare their traditional upbringing(strict) to the way of the wild, untamed United States. The book emphasizes the importance of family roots and not forgetting where one comes from."
2,I was dissapointed,"I devoted myself to this book, beginning to end. However, when it came to the end, i said ""that's it?"" I expected much more from the book. I think that Alvarez is a talented writer, for she did a great job with illustrating each one of the stories. I was on the edge of my seat just waiting for the climax. I feel, however, that there was no climax. Each story had it's rising moments, but there was no climax. You're left wondering what happened and by the end you feel as if you went nowhere. It was a little hard to follow who the speaker was throughout the novel yet it kept me attatched. I just feel that there should have been more resolvement or more understanding of what happened with the Garcia family. Or, at least, each character's stories should have tied together somehow."
3,A Gay Kid & His Psychopath Uncle,"The basic plot is that of a gangly, nerdy, kid named Dillion in his early teens who fails to fit in anywhere only in part to being gay. The uncle he never knew shows up (on parole which he violates immediately and consistently) and precedes to entrap the kid into all kinds of burglaries and other crimes. The kid winds up falling in love with his Uncle Max. Max is basically a psychopath who uses people. There is a lot of evidence that he cares a lot about the kid, but not a lot of care. There is one scene in which Max molests (statutarily rapes) Dillion and another scene in wich another character confesses to repeated acts of child sexual abuse that the reader ought to be warned about. Kenry's excellent sense of humor makes for great narration and dialouge but there is very little that one could call basic morality let alone justice in the plot."
5,Pack Your Bags!,"This film classic about two strong-willed con artists who are deeply attracted to each other but have other interests to pursue is a perfect blend of romance, suspense, and how the ruthless Barons of Industry ruled the railroads. It is truly worth the investment and everyone should see it."
3,"A Long ""Lost"" Cooper Film","Although tied-up in legal knots for years, this film was finally shown on NBC TV as a ""Saturday Night at the Movies"" presentation back in the mid-1960's. The film has a great train wreck sequence!"
3,Character actress saves the day!,"While I concur that English actress Flora Robson playing a ""mulatto"" is stretching things a bit, her studied performance, as well set decorations, is the only reason that this Cooper/Bergman vehicle is tolerable.Robson had an extremely long career on the stage and in film, comparable to contemporary Dame Judith Anderson. By portraying the role of Bergman's maid, she joined a rather short list, including Lord Olivier (""Othello"") and Ava Gardner (""Showboat""), of white actors ""passing"" as black.Hey, it was the norm, back in the day. ""Saratoga Trunk"" was no different from most era westerns or historical dramas in the practice of white actors portraying persons of color."
5,Saratoga Trunk,"It took a long time for this movie to make it to DVD, but worth the wait. A little offbeat for Gary Cooper and a brunette Ingrid Bergman, but this one is exciting and romantic and has an excellent supporting cast. The ""Trunk"" refers to a railroad line. Bergman has moved to New Orleans from Paris in order to avenge her mother, who was badly treated by the ""elite."" I've watched this movie several times on TV and I'm glad I now have it in my collection."
4,Pleasantly Evil,"The songs on this album are magnificent, heavy, and melodical. This is the first album I've listened to so far. My dad has four other album that I will listen to soon but I like this one to much. My favorite song is Atlantis Ascendant simply because it was the song that inspired me. One of my other favorite songs was the sixth song that sounded like a battle was going on. I noticed that Bal-Sagoth follows classical music because classical music will start off sounding like one thing, change it's melody and go back or change again. I have never heard a band do that. I recommend that you buy this CD, you won't regret."
3,S'alright,"Not bad, but there's too much reverb in the vocals and the single guitar thing seems out of place. The synthesized trumpets sound pretty cheesy too. On the other hand, many of these are great songs, and the lyrics give me chills every time I hear them."
3,Mud Guards,This is a very basic mud flap. Definite modding required to fit but install is easy. Nothing fancy but will at least make your lifted truck legal.
1,Does not work as described,After adding the product several times I have not noticed that it has done anything. I still have bugs floating on the surface of my pool and need to use the net to remove them.
4,ONLY IN A VIDEO GAME WOULD ANYONE WANT TO SAVE FLEAS.,"SO YOU'VE COME ACROSS THIS RARE AND HARD TO FIND GEM. WELL LUCKY US. FRANTIC FLEA IS A UNIQUE 2-D SIDE SCROLLER. THE OBJECTIVE IS SIMPLE, GET THE REQUIRED AMOUNT OF FLEAS AND LEAD THEM TO SAFETY. WHILE THE OBJECTIVE IS SIMPLE. DON'T LET THAT MAKE YOU BELIEVE YOU'LL JUST WIZ THROUGH THE GAME. IT IS A CHALLENGE. AS FAR AS GRAPHICS GO..FRANTIC FLEA IS A LIQUID SMOOTH 16-BIT ADVENTURE. I MENTIONED AT FIRST, THIS GAME IS HARD TO COME ACROSS. SO YOUR BEST BET IS TO PICK IT UP HERE AT AMAZON."
5,MR. CREEPO'S -SANDY HOOK LINGERIE PARTY MASSACRE,"THE OTHER NIGHT I WATCHED B-MOVIE FLICK ""SANDY HOOK LINGERIE PARTY MASSACRE"" & THOUGHT IT WAS VERY WELL DONE.THE WHOLE CAST DID A GREAT JOB ESPECIALLY SCREAM QUEEN DEBBIE ROCHEN WHO HAS SOME VERY GOOD ACTING SKILLS, AND OFF COURSE THE APPERENCES FROM MR.CREEPO HIMSELF MADE THE MOVIE ALL THE MORE WORTH WHILE. THE MUSIC SUPPLIED FOR THE MOVIE BY LOCAL NY ROCK BANDS LIKE ""SHOVE-IT"" WAS PERFECT FOR THIS FILM! SO IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A SEXY GORE FLICK THEN THIS ONE IS THE PERFECT PIC."
1,"It's called ""predictive programming"", folks","Staged mass murders, anyone?This film's name is no coincidence. As pointed out by researcher Jim Stone, in the movie ""The Dark Knight Rises"" there is a strike in a district called SANDY HOOK. In the premiere, there was a massacre in a theater. On the same day, someone posted a review about this B-grade horror movie SANDY HOOK Lingerie Party Massacre, which is about a serial killer who strikes after hurricanes.In November 2012 the demented elite created and named an (artificial, HAARP-controlled) hurricane SANDY that affected the whole Northeast of the USA, including both the town of Sandy Hook, NJ (where this movie is supposed to take place) and the village of Sandy Hook, in Newtown, Connecticut, where, a few weeks later, a serial killer (more than one - there is ample evidence) enters SANDY HOOK Elementary School to massacre kids....or make it look that way."
2,wireless routers give poor performance,I had an airlink g router that worked OK for 2 years then failed. The performance at more than 50 feet was variable and often dropped. I tried a trendnet router recently with the new improved wider N band. Same problem. For my distant computers I now use an Actiontec megaplug 85. Works great and it uses existing houshold wiring. I could not get a cable to some locations. Very simple to install - much more reliable than wireless.
1,Never got it.,Its been a whole month and I still haven't received it! Very upset. I would get shipments from Europe much quicker.
4,Only Color Problem,"I have to agree with the first review the paint is the weak point of this Venom figure. The paint is fading fast and turn into blue black Venom. But it's not a big deal, his size is very fit compared to my Spiderman at home. I enjoy this figure very much."
2,It's not that great,This is definetely the most attractive and most realistic Venom action figure you will find but after a couple of days I realized that this action figure is sensitive. The white paint on it is very capable of fading away.
4,Great book for fans of the Dallas Morning News,"As a big fan of The Dallas Morning News for the past 4 years, I always enjoy reading Steve Blow's column. He is insiteful, but he talks like an old friend. Plus, he isn't overly ""texan"" in attitude, which is refreshing being a Northerner living in Texas.I was so excited to see that his columns were made into a book. There are a lot of columns of his I had missed, so this is a great way of catching up. I only wish that this book was longer, and included more columns from the 97-00 era, but maybe the next one will have more. :)Even if you don't live in the Dallas metroplex area, buy this book for some humor, some old fashioned but still relevant views, and for a good read."
1,Skip It,"The writing is hackneyed, the imagination is limited and the intelligence is, too. This must be what happens when a midlist newspaper falls for a token hayseed whose sensibilities and consciousness is stuck somewhere in the middle of the last century. Skip this one."
4,Saucy,"this cd is tight...when these two came out on game recognize game, it was like they were the perfect compliment to eachother...on their various solo cd's, they still came cool, but this is the way i wanna hear these two...there is no way that anyone that truly luvz bay flowin can not feel this...get it..."
1,not exactly what I bargained for,"This is some show tune stuff. I thought it may have been a techno CD from an Old Skool DJ. NOT SO. If you're looking for show tunes this is your gig. If your looking for ""The Producer"", an old skool techno DJ, look elsewhere."
4,An o.k. product,I bought these weights hoping to be able to use them on my wrists and ankles. They are a little to bulky to use on my wrists better for your ankles.You definately will up your workout level.
3,ok-ish,"I have been using these weights for 10 months. About couple of months ago, the outer cloth-like material started to rip off. I had to put duct tape to prevent further damage. Said that, I still use them. I guess it is not that bad."
2,"Nice lights, some problems.","I ordered five of these for my living room and I have problems with three of them. On one, the metal cover on the temperature sensor was bent beyond repair. On another, the light socket was lose and unreliable. The third has a flakey temperature sensor causing the light to go off and on every 15 minutes. These are NON-IC recessed lights with no insulation anywhere around them so I have no clue whats going on.Three out of five is a bad failure rate. Unfortunately, I didn't open the boxes and notice the problems until after the return period expired so I am stuck with them. If you order these lights, check them as soon as you get them in case you have to return them!"
2,Beware if you want to use Halogen bulbs,"This kit seems like a good deal, and it is if you don't want Halogen lights...we now have 20 of these in our kitchen and the light socket is not adjustable, so the PAR 20 Halogen bulb sits about an inch recessed behind the provided trim - you see all the guts of the housing. We love the warmth of halogen, so do not want to get the other bulb option, incandescent R20, that fits in this fixture.We actually purchased the porcelain 1"" bulb extenders thinking that would be a cheap fix, rather than getting deeper baffle trims, but the extra 1"" lowers the bulb just to the opening of the baffle making it completely impossible to screw into the socket. Again, if you want halogen lights in this can - go for a different model - one with adjustable socket height."
3,Unimpressive trims,"I installed 27 of these without running into any majur issues. The box is a bit large which makes fitting wires and wire nuts easy but it you are using flex EMT, makes it a bit uneasy to squeeze through the cutout.My main disappointment is in the trims. The remodel cans have a lip on them and these trims do not have a grove inside of them to account for the lip so what you get is a trim that does not sit flush with the ceiling. The gap are smalls but my application was low enough for them to be seen during daylight.Some people mentioned that the trims do not stay in. To deal with this, I slightly bent the trip clips outward so they place more pressure on the can and du not fall out. Per instructions, for heat reasons, the rubber grommets need to come off the clips before installing the trims. They're just part of packaging."
3,trim doesn't stay in,"Install was fairly easy, though locking the main unit into place with the drywall clips is really difficult. The look was overall ok, though the trim was not a true white, and if people are walking around upstairs, they fall lose. I was installing hardwood floors upstairs, and everysingle one popped out, and damaged the floors on my first floor. Until then, I was thinking about getting some more. Not anymore."
5,Easy to do,"I got these fixtures from Amazon because they had the best price, better than the home improvement stores in my area. installed easily in my outdoor soffits came complete with bulbs and baffles really a joy to work with when things do what they claim and all the instructions are easy to follow."
5,Best deal I have found,"I am a industrial enginer and ave to say that this light at this price is the best eal you will find . I have used cooper lighting on many bids and specs for layout ,and for the price and quality you will not find a better light. I opened the bezzel to the max to except r30 series cfl flood light , but with the low heat and the fact you can purchase the r30 in a contractor pack for half the price. I also found that with the watt change you can run 3 of these compaired to a 60watt light and still save money."
3,A little slow at times...,"After being left at the altar, Lady Jane Welsham seems shocked, but less concerned than those around her. She sees this scandal as an opportunity to find true love and is ready to embrace a freedom she has never experienced. That is until the groom's cousin steps in to mend the ""wounds"" his cousin has inflicted. Grayson Boscastle, Marquess of Sedgecroft, is a notorious rogue, but is willing to court Jane in an attempt to boost her sullied reputation. Grayson assures her family and himself that he is doing this for Jane, but maybe he is trying to convince everyone a little too much???I didn't like this book as much as its sequel ""The Love Affair of an English Lord."" While the characters were well developed and there was chemistry, I thought the book lost momentum 2/3 of the way through. Grayson learns a secret about Jane and decides to teach her a lesson....I thought it took away from their relationship. Nice read though and I cannot wait for Heath's story."
3,"An entertaining romp, but ...","I enjoyed this, I read it all and thought it was fun. BUT, as an avowed regency fan, I was a little disappointed. Despite the fact that it's about a scoundrel and rake who meets the woman of his dreams at her ""never-to-occur"" wedding, the characters and dialog seemed more than a little contrived and unlikely. Enough so that it was difficult to get carried away by the story (e.g., a well-bred Regency lady would not visit a well-known courtesan -- in broad daylight -- without social ramifications)."
3,Nothing special here,"This was the first time I have read a book by Jillian Hunter and I was very excited about it because she received high praise but this was a hard book for me to finish. It is not bad for sure, but there is NO fire in it. Where was the chemistry between the two leads? I was halfway through and wondering what was wrong when it hit me. These characters have no depth. They are like drawings on a canvas-- flat and one dimensional. I have read that this is her first effort. Maybe her other ones are better and I will give them a try. But you can skip this one and save your money or borrow it from a library if you have nothing else to do."
5,The seduction of an English Lord,"This was a very interesting book. It had mystery, romance andamusement in it. It was one of my favorite of all the Boscastlebooks. I hope the author will write more about the family. Thiswas a very good series."
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!!!,"This product is cheaply made. In the picture it looks like rubber but it is not!!!It's hard plastic, there is no give to the material and it cracked when I was removing the tabs that secured it to the cardboard backing..... that were part of its packaging!!!Spend a couple more bucks and get something better."
4,A talent worthy of more respect and recognition.,"Best known for his #1 R&B hit ""Love Won't Let Me Wait"", Major Harris was a talented soul ballad singer worthy of more recognition. His subsequent albums were all quite good but (strangely) he would never again score a big hit single. Virtually all of his R&B hit singles are included here (as well as some LP-only tracks). If you like 1970s Philly soul, add this CD to your library."
2,"Same Book, Puffed-Up New Edition","Professor Pollack, a pioneer of feminist criticism and art history, has written a classic in Vision and Difference. This new edition has a cover with her surname in bold letters, Pollack, as if playing off her famous name. An unsturdy introduction adds a page to the length of the book.After careful study of both editions, one will find no textural additions to this edition.The title has been changed by juxtaposing words so that the first edition does not appear along side this version.The first edition is titled Vision and Difference: FEMININITY, FEMINISM and the Histories of Art. Two words have been switched."
3,Unique take on Disco,"The opener Got To Have Loving is a major classic, a tour de force of imaginative synth textures, rhythmic variation and hypnotic girl vocals framing Don Ray's powerful voice and bitter lyrics. The uptempo Body And Soul has a Latin-American rhythmic feel while Midnight Madness is pure 70's disco in the vein of KC and the Sunshine Band or The Ritchie Family. The influence of Eurodisco musician and producer Cerrone is evident throughout, especially on Standing In The Rain with its soaring synthesizer. The title track is unremarkable mid-tempo disco, although it has some nice flutes and other effects. Garden of Love is an interesting album from the disco era and contains one solid gold must-have track in the form of Got To Have Loving."
4,The Garden of Love,"Here's another disco classic. This CD, like ""Cerrone 3 Supernature"", has been resurrected from the original tapes. I can detect no sound diference from the original vinyl recording....except that there are no pops or clicks.Don Ray, although not as popular as Cerrone, did collabrate with Cerrone to produce some of the music on this CD. The track ""Garden of Love"" is perhasp the best song of all, (as far as I'm concerned), and it was worth it for me to purchase this CD just for that track."
5,Wild Trance Music from Lemurian Jungles,"A must own for all accordian freaks, polyrthymic, polytimbral, polyglossic exciting from the land of howling lemurs and creole peoples"
3,New Romantics?,"This is the story of a post punk hard edged band that turned into just another 80's dance band. I guess Mtv was too alluring for them. They weren't the only ones I mean PIL, Joy Division/New Order to name a few more to jump on that bandwagon. They had so much talent and they gave it up for predictable pop songs. You never saw American Hardcore, Metal or Grunge bands do this. I lived back then and to see this happening with all of the good British bands was very depressing."
5,The Master Game,"I had the book ""The Master Game"" since the hippie times of 70's. When a friend of mine wanted to borrow it, I luckily photocopied the important pages of the book. He of couse never returned it. Now, 30 years later have ""found"" the copies again and realized that the teachings are very much the same as Gurdijeff's- the armenian philosopher & teacher. Also the ""Guru"" of jazz musicans John Coltrane,keith jarret & Charles Lloyd. The two latter have works dedicated to Gurdjeff. The master game has since become the leading philosophy in my life, with all references to inner life, physical training and focusing of goals. For the right person, it could be the change of the course of his life."
3,Good service fast shipping,The fan motor that I ordered was shipped quickly & was a promised. I did however order the wrong fan but this seller supplied me with the information to send it back & they credited my account. Overall good experience.Thank You!
5,Manual for Understanding Insurgencies,"After reading Anderson's book, I felt that my knowledge about insurgency was about the equivalent of just a few pieces that were part of a big puzzle that Anderson puts together when describing the various factors motivating people to raise arms, and the common points between the various causes served by guerrilla armies in the world. Anderson lived with them; and shares his observations in his book as nothing more than a story teller and, at the end of each chapter, gives a brief analysis.Get the book!"
4,Nice chisel set but are already beginning to dull,"This is a nice chisel set for the price. My only negative comment would be that the chisels have already started to dull after only a few weeks of intermittent use. Granted, these were used to break apart rocks, but I expected the edges to stay sharp longer. Overall a good buy."
5,"When the race is done, is there room for one more son","All these things that I've done is so beautiful, you'll be moved and influenced even if you didn't like either Mr. Brightside or Somebody told me. This is the second song that Brendan Flowers (Lead Vocalist) used the gospel choir in, and it gives it a surreal almost surround sound in the background as he sings. Very unique and quite moving to listen too, its as though the song is being sung reverently by Brendan.In short love the killers, although I would say it's better if you just buy the entire CD Hot Fuss. At least for those of us that can't afford to buy singles all the time. Trust me, you won't be dissapointed or let down."
2,Not really sure why I bought this...,"Probably because I've become a Killers/Interpol/Bravery fanatic. The title track is an okay song, but not really up there with their other recent singles from ""Hot Fuss"". ""Why Don't You Find Out For Yourself"" is a nice track that sounds like a studio recording, not a BBC session live track. Again, nice stuff, but does any of this really add to the overall Killers experience? I say no. Stick with the new single of ""Smile Like You Mean it"" and the remixes of ""Somebody Told Me"" and you'll be a happier Killer, IMO."
1,Kindle edition line breaks in the middle of each line,"At first I didn't think this would be a big deal, and tried to read the book despite the line breaks in the middle of each line (there no matter what text size is selected) but after awhile reading this book became quite a chore. If a multitude of line breaks would bother you, better to buy a printed version."
2,Over Written,I have read books on mysticism and they are not so wordy with long sentences. She includes flowerly adjectives that are unnecessary. I have heard that people give up reading her books because they are too difficult to understand. I think it's because she really doesn't write well. I can understand what she is saying if I take time to translate it simply. Taking out all the unnecessary words as I am reading it takes time and not worth the read. There are a lot easier and better written books that have the same information.
4,Practical Mysticism,"This is a ""must read"" for anyone whose spiritual journey has led them to writings of St. John of the Cross, Therese of Avila, Thomas Merton, other books of Evelyn Underhill, etc."
1,Don't waste your money,"I'm a gadget guy and thought my wife would like this to carry around pictures of our kids. Pricey, picture quality is very poor, and after a couple of drops of her keys the casing split."
4,HO scale Cat is well detailed,"I bought this little guy to use in a diorama (scene) I'm building where new railroad track is being laid -- I'm a model railroader. I was surprised that it is well detailed and includes working parts for a very reasonable price. One hates to spend lots of money on the expensive models that collectors like when it will just be put on a diorama like this and perhaps given away. With only a little retouching, it now looks like several real-life units around town, mud splatters, rust and all."
4,smaller than we thought,"This is a very small toy. Equivalent to matchbox car size. We did not fully appreciate this until it arrived. It is a nice looking, well built toy, though the tread comes off pretty easily and could be lost or thrown out as they resemble rubber bands. The wire that attaches to the arm also has come out, and is not easily repairable. I think we were a bit disappointed at how small it was, though perhaps that was our fault for not doing a bit more research. It is recommended for older kids/ collectors, and it would probably be wise to take this advise."
1,This toy was a piece of junk.,"I ordered this toy for my 5 year old who loves diggers and was looking for ages for a backhoe with treads. He played with it for less than an hour. Instantly I had to replace the treads. Replacing the treads quickly escalated into putting the arm mechanism back together. Finally, honestly in less than an hour, the arm just fell completely off. My son is not a rough player. He was playing indoors and not in real sand or dirt and this toy was not at all worth the price."
4,More counter space,Works great just like the picture shows and it folds over the grill when stored. Does get slightly in the way of the wind breaker on the corners but there is still enough for the windbreaker to attach to.
1,HAAAAA,HHAHAHA DOESNT EVEN COME WITH THE DAGER? SERIOUSLY? WHAT A JOKE ITEM. ALMOST LAUGHED TO DEATH WHEN I OPENED THIS SCAM
5,An Amazing Good Read!,"I read Pop Co after it was recommended to me by a friend. It was the first book I read by Scarlet Thomas but now this book is one of my all time favorites and I have ordered ""Our Tragic Universe"" and The End of My Y."" My only regret was that I was not able to read this book in my teens. I think the central character, Alice, makes an intriguing and inspiring female role model for teen girls. She successfully emulates the confusion, awkwardness and mean-ness of teen girls and still manages to evolve into a smart, likeable, independent adult. I liked all of the characters presented and enjoyed their back stories and the blending of math, cryptology and mass market manipulation made me think about what I was reading. A great thought-provoking book!"
2,A Mess,"Remember late nights sitting around a dorm room discussing ""deep"" thoughts about life? No? Then this book MAY offer you something... but the ending is a absolutely ridiculous mess. There are likeable bits, but I can't recommend the novel at all."
3,Good cure for insomnia,"I don't understand how the other reviewers found a book about a geek obsessed with cracking codes to be a topic of interest. I was lured into it by the amusing title and quite funny observations about a toy manufacturing company, but only got a quarter of the way through it in the end, before giving up. The prose is monotonous and the story perilously low on plot. If I want pages and pages about the history of code during the second world war I'll buy a book about it. If you are a computer nerd or fascinated by (yawn) code cracking, this is the one for you. I was having trouble sleeping while I read this book and it did the trick of sending me off into the land of nod. So thanks for that Scarlett."
1,Not Engaging,"Unfortunately, this book was so poor that I chose not finish. I did not find the main character, Alice, likeable at all. The author went on and on about Alice's unusual habits, how she chose to dress out of style and didn't want to be part of any group or have any friends. It seemed like she was trying to hard to be different. But then she goes and has sex with a guy without even speaking to him first!In addition to the plot, there were pages and pages of math and information on breaking codes. Some was interesting, especially the part about creative thinking methods, but the rest was just monotonous. Very disappointing book!"
4,Way better than you'd think,It arrived on time and was very well packed. The quality of the material I would rate at 8-9 and I would buy it again.
4,Book Review,"This was a pretty interesting book. Timmy's family doesn't have a lot of money, and after a bad winter they lost quite a few animals. They cannot afford to keep their ranch. Timmy does all she can do to save her ranch, but she doesn't know how much she can do without much money. None of her family wants to leave the ranch, but pretty soon there isn't going to be a choice."
3,Decent Viola,"This viola is decent for an orchestra student. The strings and bridge are not very durable/strong, after a tuning one bridge cracked, and after a few months of use one string is starting to ""peel"" The bow itself had many loose hairs (when tightened) when it arrived, and weekly, some strings start to easily fall out. Another con is that the bridge is not cut, so you'll need to send it into a string shop to do so for around $30-$40. Overall it does produce a nice sound and is good for maybe a High School string student."
2,Waste of money,"Bought this item for a gift. Found out after giving the item to the recipient that it cannot be tuned because the tuning keys are loose and will not keep the strings in tune (they loosen and the string becomes un-tuned as soon as your finger touches the string to play). So, I wasted money on a gift that turned out to be worthless. I instructed the recipient to throw it in the trash and bought another elsewhere. Couldn't return the item because the time limit had expired by the time I had given it as a gift."
2,Losing the Plot,"After the success of ""10 cents a Dance"", The Flirtscame along with this follow up. There's nothing that comes close to a memorable hit on this album. Songs like ""I Was A Teenage Werewolf"" and ""Big Boys Don't Cry"" seem to hark after some 50's bubblegum drive-in era, but have such limp production values, that you will be hard pushed to feel like dancing. Only the single release ""Danger"" has any of the familiar Bobby O feel to it, making this the worst Flirts album, only worth buying if you have already got all the others."
2,Just a quickie,"This is one short album, clocking in at just over 26 minutes. At times, it seems longer. Most of these songs just sound like rehashes of ""Jukebox"", but less memorable. However, the sound quality is very good (which can be hit or miss when it comes to Hot Production releases.) What I like best about this cd is the album version of ""Danger."" It's not too long or too short, coming out to roughly 4 and a half minutes.Because this cd is now out of print, the price is very good due to sellers needing to get it off their shelves. It's worth that price, mainly for ""Danger."""
2,Re-issue does not improve this poor album.,"After the success of ""10 Cents A Dance"", The Flirts came along with this follow up, but sadly there aren't any hit singles on it, so unfortunately the poor material stands out even more prominently. Songs like ""I Was A Teenage Werewolf"" and ""Big Boys Don't Cry"" and ""Nice Girls Say No"" are among the worst that Bobby O has ever churned out in his bubblegum surf-party mode (the titles alone should really be enough warning!).Out of the others, they are mostly forgettable and only the single release ""Danger"" has any of the familiar Bobby O feel to it, so I guess that's just one good track for the price of 10, making this the worst Flirts album. At least the Unidisc version has again added 12"" mixes, and quite a few this time, but they don't really make the package that much more attractive. Only worth buying if you have already got all the others."
3,Disappointed,"Expecting more than 5% cashmere, I was a little disappointed in this product. The cuffs on the sleeves are too loose and frankly, too long; the botton 'pulls' when fastened although it is full lenough. Altogether, it is passable, but not what I was expecting. For the price, it was satisfactory, nevertheless."
3,"Not as nice as the ""crystal"" ipod covers, but serves its purpose","I bought an Apple Crystal ipod screen protector (so expensive) and it was amazing. These are just flexible, cheaper covers that get the job done but don't look awesome. All the bubbles don't always come out (make sure you follow the instructions cause I didn't the first time and it looked terrible). Also keep in mind that it's stretchy material, so if you push down hard when ""rubbing out the bubbles"" then it will stretch the cover and can be slightly bigger than you thought.Good temporary fix, especially because you get a good amount of them."
2,Charlie X -- a boy with super powers challenges the crew,"Charlie is your average teenager, but must come to grips with the problems of adolescence, while dealing with his super powers. Somewhat entertaining."
3,Better than expected,"I bought this on a whim and was going to take it back after reading the reviews. However, my son saw it in the bag so I let him keep it.He absolutely loves this toy! He would give it 6 stars if he could. But, he's only 3 1/2 so I averaged his rating with mine and it got 3.Our toy seemed to be in OK working condition and has not broken anywhere after 3 uses. The bubble accordion did make bubbles, and the color waterfall worked fine. The thing that churns the water to make bubbles doesn't do much.Here are my complaints:You really need to buy the color dots to go with this. It came with a couple, which lasted about 2 minutes. The bubble stuff was quickly gone as well. Luckily I had some red color dots we used, and just used baby soap to make bubbles.The plastic parts seem flimsy. While mine hasn't broken yet, it definitely doesn't seem like it's going to hold up over time.It was worth buying because of how my son loves it, but overall I usually like a better quality toy."
1,It stinks!,"All of the reviews here are right on. The color tablets dissolve in 1 or 2 uses, making the most fun aspect of the toy useless. The bubble making part is awful. Take what these reviewers have said to heart and do NOT waste your money on this product."
1,Not Durable,"This toy lasted through two baths. My two year old and four year old enjoyed it although it was difficult for my two year old to push the buttons. The bubble making portion didn't work very well. After the first bath, one of the buttons had stopped working and after the second bath, one of the cranks had broken off and the toy was thrown out. The kids were disappointed."
1,How did this one make it to the market?,"I usually only search for reviews on toys I plan on spending over $50 on. However, after this purchase, I've changed my ways. NOTHING works. I threw the toy away after the 2nd use only because I couldn't find the receipt to return it with. The other reviews are right on. Don't waste your money."
1,Horrible,I'm sorry I didn't read the online reviews and purchased this on impulse at the store. Nothing works right. The bubbles do not blow at all.
3,Visual FoxPro 5,"I was looking for something to help me make the transition. but this book doesn;'t do that. it appears comprehensive enough.. so comp[rehensive that it rattles me...The book that i would recommend would be Using Visual Foxpro 5 by michael P antonovich, alice atkins, marl atkins, richard i curtis."
4,Looks better than OPI,"Got this and OPI after I took artificial nails off. My nails looked so bad. This covered the icky white spots on nails left from removing the artificials. The OPI ridge filler accentuated the ugly spots on nails. Like it, good product."
5,Top Drawer,"I'm a professor and have been playing for two years (inexpensive mid-life crisis.) This book is fantastic in terms of accurate breakdown and analysis of the songs. Its best attribute is the CD instruction which provides slow and up to tempo versions of the songs. Some of the songs are not for solo guitar, but others (e.g. Blackbird, You've Got to Hide Your Love Away) are. Learning just one very well is worth the price of the book. Keep pickin' readers!"
4,Nice gift,Was on a niece's gift list over the holidays. she loved it what more does it matter. Hope to hear some songs soon.
2,Not for solo guitar,Buy this book if you're in a band and want to learn Beatle music. But none of the arrangements are for solo guitar--they are for 2 or three guitars and a vocalist. Buy the Beekman or Washington books if you want good solo guitar arrangements.
2,kindle version with audio does not work on a kindle,"The content of this book is excellent. My review is based specifically on the Kindle version which is advertised as containing audio. The fine print is that that the audio apparently works on the kindle reader for ipad. It does not work on an actual Kindle, I am using both a standard Kindle and the Kindle Fire."
5,They're MADE IN THE USA!,Good quality impact socket extensions made here in the U.S. of A. If you're tired of the TaiChino crap on the market then Buy American; get these.
4,"Great set, but red holder not included","I really like these balldrivers. The handles are great. I bought this set instead of other Bondhus sets because of the red plastic holder that is shown in the picture. However, my set came in a clear plastic bag with just thin cardboard to hold the drivers in place. Also, the plastic bag was torn.I'd have still bought them and I am glad I did. They should just be pictured differently."
