5,Great CD. Awesome Music.,I love this CD. There is not one song on here that I didn't immediately fall in love with. There is something about the way Collective Soul sings that is instantly catchy :).
5,Wow! Well Worth The Wait!,"This is the best disc since Dosage. The disc kicks off with ""Better Now"" and it rocks all the way through. The ballads are great, and there is not a bad song on here. My favorite so far is ""Home"". You will definitely enjo this album."
5,Their Baaack,"This is an awesome cd. CS has definately rejuvinated themselves and are ""perfect to stay"". A must have for a new fan or a diehard like myself."
5,Excellent CD,"I was beginning to wonder whether CS was going to release a new CD or not!On top of having an excellent cover, the CD itself is pretty!But seriously, if you liked Blender and Dosage, this CD is definately a MUST HAVE. I liked it better than Blender, but I'm not sure if Dosage can ever be topped by another one of their CDs.The songs grow on you fast, and are quite catchy. There are NO fillers in this CD, so it's pretty short, but it's still awesome and well worth the 4 year wait..."
5,Collective Soul has done it again,"Once again these guys have put together a collection of songs that all sound great. Just bought the new CD, put it in my car, and loved every minute of it. As usual it's a good collection of fast moving alternative songs and slowed down ballads."
5,Collective Soul quenches thirst,"After a long hiatus where speculations swirled over a band break-up, Collective Soul emerges from their slumber with a roar. This album gets this 5 piece band back to their roots. The album has the variety you like to see from your favorite melodic group. They have the touching ballad of ""Satellite"", the rawk of ""Counting the Days"", and the happy groove ""Him"" This album while back to their roots shows progression and experimentation. Ed Roland continues to lead the group down a great musical journey. We look forward to hearing about these guys for some time to come."
5,I love all of the songs!!!!,"This is the best CD I have listened to in awhile! I guess I have never paid attention to Collective Soul before, but once I heard the song ""Better Than"", I was hooked! I even have that song as my ringtone on my phone! I think all of the songs on this latest CD are awesome, and I love them! Buy their CD!!!! :)"
5,class of '70,"My 8 year old grandson requested this book for Christmas. I was hesitant to buy it for him because I thought this was a ""girl's"" book. My daughter is a 1st grade teacher and told me the Junie B. Jones books appeal to both genders. She was right....my grandson loved it!"
4,Junie B. Jones Is A Graduation Girl (Book 17),It's kindergarten graduation! All the children in Room Nine are excited when they get their bright white graduation gowns. Mrs. says to keep them in their boxes until the big day. But Junie B. Jones just can't help herself. Then - uh-oh! - an accident happens! Can Junie B. find a way to fix things? Or will graduation day be a spotty dotty disaster?
3,Oldies but goodies,This CD has a lot of songs I'm not familiar with but did enjoy it. The quality isn't the greatest but recommend it for any Sonny & Cher fans.
2,Help,"Help! I'm trapped inside a Sonny & Cher review and I don't know how I got here and I think I like it. A lot of time has gone by, kids, and there's not much left of the world that spawned this unholy coupling, but it is a suitable window into a certain side of Sixties culture that was so magnificently decayed and bankrupt, with music that is a precursor for, yes, the amazingly bad songs of the film ""Ishtar"" that . . . well, ok, I've said enough. You either know at this point to go forth or run, but I can say no more."
4,Baby don't let this CD go,"The duo really strikes a chord on this excellent little set of songs. You might be disappointed if you want any Cher solo material. All of these tracks are love songs between the then couple or statements on the world and are very convincing. The tracks are a bit rough due the their age, but they still stand up well. Highlights include ""Baby, Don't Go"", ""Living For You"" and of course ""I Got You Babe"" which has the original and a mellower version from the movie ""Good Times"". For any fan of those years inn pop music when Sonny and Cher's style riled the charts, you'll love this CD. I should warn that only there sixties material is on here and not any seventies tracks like ""All I Ever Need Is you"". Still very lovely music"
5,This is classic Sonny and Cher.,"The energy and sweetness of 60's Sonny and Cher are here in a great number of the tracks represented. The best cuts are ""Baby Don't Go"", and the classic ""I Got You Babe"". ""Have I Stayed Too Long"", competes with these tracks though never a real hit. The productions are Sonny Bono Spectorian, and the harmony is unique. The songs have a simple beauty that has long left the arena of opo music. This set includes all the major hits, prior to the 70's more slick output.This is Sonny and Cher in love."
2,Not a practical book,"This is certainly a complete theoretical book on revenue management.But for somebody like me who works on a revenue management system in a car rental company, it is not useful and can lead on the contrary to an overly complicated and impossible to implement system.In any field there is always the theory and how people adapt it to real world cases and there is often a gap between the two.There should be another book that shows the complete process (relatively simple cases should be good enough) of building a revenue management system starting from strictly real cases as related by the client, relating in particular the cost of the process and the benefit of the implementation as expressed by the client.But does the authors have the experience necessary to the writing of such a book?Jean-Jacques Laubl√© Eurli AllocarStrasbourg France"
3,Does job but too brittle,"I cracked one in half just screwing it in snugly. Then I ordered another one and it arrived smashed. They need to make these with MUCH better plastic. However, it does the job as long as you screw it in PERFECTLY."
1,Don't Buy Unless You Have $$$ to Throw Away,"I bought these, like a moron, and discovered that Home Depot sells them for $0.99 each. I thought I would save myself a trip and order them on here."
5,"UNintimidating, compact, concise","In one skinny unintimidating book that has less heft than an issue of TV Guide (that's physical heft, not literary worth), you get all the basics. Great place to start. Terms and equations are explained with simplicity. After reading just this book you'd be able to go do some time series analysis on your computer and have a clue what the output means."
4,Straightforward,If you wanna get an idea bout interrupted times series this is your best choice. If you are rather interested in an advanced and detailed explanation find something else.
4,True Navy,The oerson that wrote this book is a freind as I was stationed on the same ships. This is a true and funny account of what took place on these ships.
4,Wonderful spirited R&B Classic.,Unfortunately Chris Bender was unable to prove what we all knew to be true. He was a star and will remain a part of R&B history through times end. He is missed by his true fans and his music will live inside our hearts forever.
3,A Solid Vocalist That Struggled For Mainstream Acceptance,"Chris Bender's Draped includes more hip-hop/new jack flavored tunes, plus some slightly above average vocals and great high caliber production. Bender doesn't lack in originality, his problem is more so that theres not one STAND-OUT track to break him into the mainstream. The album hit No. 92 on the R&B charts, which is awful, but this shouldn't mean that the album should be overlooked. His two charted singles ""I Knew"" and ""That's Not The Way"" broke into the top-70 on the R&B charts, and the heavily respected (today) singles ""Kiss and Make Up"" and ""Who Will I Choose"" have the strong lead, which most the album lacks. Bender's death has nothing to do with the material on Draped, he was a good vocalist that struggled to break out of the pack."
4,"A combination of Hip/Hop, Rap and R&B!","I loved the movie just as much as I loved the movie. Great well known artists on this soundtrack, such as Jill Scott and Ginuwine. No complaints!"
3,Sound Track,"I like this sound track because Jill Scott has an incredible song on CD called ""Comes to the Light""! Go Jilly from Philly!"
2,Purchased this CD for one song only!!,"This CD is great for young teeny boppers that care nothing at all about the actual content of what they are hearing and just want some good party cuts.I purchased this CD ONLY for the Jill Scott song, ""Comes to the Light"" and anyone who knows her music , knows that her style is the complete opposite of everything else on the CD.This album is NOT for the Grown & Sexy!!"
1,Only the First Five Chapters!,"I bought this audio for my daughter to listen to as she read along, only to find out that it's only the audio for the first five chapters of the book. Completely useless! (The Children of the New Forest, Narrated by Laurence Kennedy)"
3,A good book!,"Children fed on the diet of Enid Blyton books will find the plot familiar, as that venerable lady stole the style and some content off this classic and established an industry of sorts! The story revolves around 4 children who spend their time in the new forest after their house is burned down. The plot revolves around Edward the eldest kid and his younger brother. However, author being a male chauvinist of the 19 century deems it waste of time to focus on females. He also treats Pablo, the gypsy boy as if were an animal and some comments about his race should be struck off. However the book is very easy to read."
2,Lenevo black leather carry case,"it's unexpected carry case,it's called ultra portable but it's not,they said : it's for 12 inch but I found it's for 15 inch so I'm not happy with this case."
4,Nice starter set,"I have had this product for a few years and I can attest that it is fantastic. It offers a great set of bits and the case makes access easy. You can set the case on a workbench with an included rear support (like a picture frame). My only issue is the drill bits. The bits have a rounded bottom that seems to always loosen up in my drill. I perfer ""hex"" bottoms to the bits stay put while drilling.If you can get this at the right price then its well worth it."
3,"Not bad value, not high quality",This is a cheap way to buy a set of drill bits but over time I have swapped out most of the bits for higher quality ones as they become blunt quickly. The gimmick parts in there are just that and very impractical when used.
3,Just ok,"I did expected something different, something really special that I can use in my everyday job, however the set is just ok."
2,not included,"my major problem with this is that almost half of the pieces are screws and whatnot, also they put a set of Allen keys and sockets which has nothing to do with a drill so its not really a 150 peice drill set more like a mix and match tool kit"
1,Don't waste your money,"You'd think the Black and Decker label would mean something, but this was trash. Bits broke after one use, the first time I used one of the hole saws, it burned out within 20 seconds. Drills wouldn't go through wood, one made no dent at all trying to drill in plaster. The Phillips-head bits stripped after less than a minute of use. Complete waste of money.Several reviewers commented on how much hardware you get for the money, how nice the case was. I would agree: there's a lot of stuff here, and a nice case, but it doesn't matter if the hardware is no good."
5,Good value for a basic Burner and Log Set,"Just installed the Peterson Real Fyre 18 Inch Southern Oak Log Set With Vented Natural Gas G4 Burner - Match Light. Relatively straightforward if you are a little handy and can connect natural gas fittings and line; you will need a couple of good size wrentches. The unit came with a pipe cap on the left and nozel on the right; using a pipe wrentch I needed to switch them for my particular fireplace. You will likely need a natural gas flexible tube kit (Lowes...about $24) and either some teflon tape or pipe dope. I also needed an extra valve to turn the unit on and off or I would have to go out to my garage to open/close the valve to turn the unit on/off, since it does not come with one. This unit required that you keep your damper open at all times when you it is in use. Instructions were adequate, but could use to be improved and streamlined. All in all, pretty good value for the money and I'm glad I purchased it."
1,Technically proficient but (bad) music,"This borders on elevator music. While I respect the playing and singing abilities of Simply Red, none of the songs on this CD have the same strong feel as their famous ""If You Don't Know Me By Now"", which I have just learned is a cover...""The Long and Winding Road"" by the Beatles is a good example of a song that has a softer touch, but still evokes great emotion.Regarding the lyrics, they're nothing special and nothing that hasn't been said before is on this CD.Given their skills, Simply Red should just take the greatest songs of decades ago and cover them."
4,husband loves it,"My husband loves this show! I think it would be a good gift for anybody who is into law enforcement reality shows like Cops.The show follows around a group of offices in the Newark NJ auto theft task force. Interesting how they get these guys. Sometimes, it's via a Lojack and other times, they'll leave a car running with the doors unlocked. If somebody takes it, they jump on him.If this sounds good to you, you'll like the show!"
5,A Classic Score,"This score is just amazing, very moving,very touching, this is a great score. I also recommend the Dr. Phibes movies. Watch 'em and get this score, it's time to remember what great films with great music are made of."
2,Broken Packaging,"Item's protective CD packaging was broken, disc rattling inside, however CD itself no marks or scrarches, worked perfectly well. Besides that the item itself, the soundtrack is what I wanted; however resorted to stroing the item in a different case."
1,disapointing,this book is just a rehash of the crafters recipe book-you would find that to be a much better resource-
1,Too much pig farming.,"This book has too much about motorcycles and pig farming in it. The horses are sway backed and are not at all like Kentucky horses. The messages contain bad values and the story doesn't make sense. The writing is not just ""plain jane"" but positively ill written. Read the ""Cat in the Hat"" instead."
1,We Didn't Like It,"My children and I didn't like the book. It was too long and too silly. They like books about horses and dinosaurs, but they didn't find this one interesting enough to finish."
2,Thomas Breaks The Rules,This tape is not so very good. All I can say is that James In a Mess is the only story worth watching in my opinion and Double Trouble is not bad either. If you plan to buy this tape you might want to change your mind.
4,Wilderness Survival Handbook,"Alan Fry is a Canadian woodsman with years of experience in the art of wilderness survival. His book is a concise and readable guide for the preparation and execution of a survival plan, especially in the extreme environment of the boreal north. Although its emphasis is on emergency situations in a particular ecosystem, many of his ideas can be readily adapted to any temperate region or contingency by the intelligent reader. Please note that this is not primarily a book for the recreational backpacker. Rather, it's a hard-core guide to survival under extreme circumstances in a particular environment. That having been said, it's still recommended reading for anyone who ventures into the outdoors. Useful, light-weight, and perfect for the field."
5,great dance music,You just can't beat the Almighty label when it comes to dance music. They will drag up a song from 30-50 yrs ago and make it new again. Thank God for the Supremes and Almighty
5,Seuss Fan,"I just bought the My First Leap Pad Bus for my 28 month old. She wasn't very interested in it at first and I thought I'd just wasted $25...... until we got ""There's a Wocket in My Pocket"" to go with it. She enjoys the story and touching the different Seuss creatures with the magic pen to hear their silly comments (we especially love the jertain in the curtain page). It's a great book and has encouraged my daughter to give some of the other My First Leap Pad books a chance."
5,"Very, very strong!!!","This band is really incredible. Their first album, was an impressive piece of melodic/death metal, and now came with this masterpiece in all proportions. Exquisite guitar riffs, amazing drums and incredible vocals. This album is absolutely on the top five albums of 2006."
5,it will not dissapoint,"this is easily one of the best metal CD's ever released. i swear, i get goosebumps from it on every song. i was a huge fan of their debut album symmetric in design, i found their lyrics to be thought provoking and their drum and guitar work to be a template for how metal should be made. since hearing their two albums i measure other bands up against them. easily one of the best metal bands to emerge out of swissmissland. the kaleidoscopic god will leave you slack jawed in awe and with the hair on the back of your neck standing up. the vocals are incredible, transitioning from a gutteral growl to one of the most melodic voices ive ever heard. the guitar and drum work is stunning and fresh. yes, i hear a lot of influence from other bands such as soilwork and dreamtheater, but only in the way of this is what soilwork and dreamtheater wish they sounded like. an amazing album from start to finish. GET IT!!!!"
4,"Comprehensive, but not specifically for Danes","This book was helpful with some tips on owning a Great Dane, but most of what it had to say was general and not exactly specific to the Dane. The majority of the advice was about dog ownership in general. In fact, in the section ""Is the Great Dane right for you?"" it basically said, ""if you are ready for the responsibility of owning a dog and have the room for it to live and the money to buy its food, then the Great Dane is right for you."" I was hoping for a little more that applied to getting a Great Dane. All-in-all the book did have some good tips for anyone who is looking to own a large or giant breed dog."
3,Good Info But Lacking Specifics,"This was a well-written general guide for dog owners, and I enjoyed the pictures of great danes. While it was a good read, I would have preferred information more specific to this breed. It was a little general for my tastes. While the name is mostly accurate (it is a comprehensive guide for your dog), it was still somewhat lacking if you wanted more information regarding this breed."
4,good book,"good basic book to have for Great Dane tips, and references for problems or situations you may come across while raising a dog."
4,Helped us bring our new Great Dane puppy into our house and family,My wife has consulted this book many times during the weeks since we brought our Great Dane puppy into our family. She (and I) have real confidence in this author's recommendations. It is open in our kitchen most of the time. I encourage you to consider it if you are in the process of acquiring (or thinking about acquiring) a friend of this special breed.
1,"Misleading Title ""Getting Started with the TI-86/85","I bought this book thinking it would give me a good start with working college Algebra on the TI-86. I was wrong! This book starts with instructions in Pre-Calculs and advances from there. The title leads you to believe there are instructions starting at the basic level which can be applied to Algerbra, but that is not the case. Unless you want to learn Calculus graphing problems, I do not recommend this book."
4,"Good stem, but pay attention to the clamp diameter","Seems like a good enough stem, but I couldn't find any notes anywhere that specified which handlebara area clamp diameter this was before ordering. I was hoping it would be 26.0 like most new threadless road stems but it ended up being 25.4 like most older road handlebars and mountain bike handlebars. Not a big deal as I had another bike I could use it on, but I figured I would post it here in case anyone else was wondering.Like another reviewer mentioned, this in combination with a stem riser does a great job of getting your handlebars up higher and back closer to you for a more upright riding position."
3,Too thin for my fat bar,"I bought this stem as I wanted to convert my trek mountain bike into a comfort bike, but trek handle bars are too fat for this stem. Luckily I have another bike I can use this on, but pay close attention to the measurements to make sure you get a stem that fits your bike."
1,Better quality from the Dollar Store,"If a middle school shop class was to make these knives, they would be at least a 100 times better!If you need a mirror to shave with, use the cutting edge of these knives.IF they were bought at the dollar store, they would only cost you $13 -- probably still too much."
1,in addition to previous letter,"Instead of the name of this set""14-Piece"" it contains only 13 knives and wood block"
1,finish comes off of the knife handles,I am unhappy with the finish on the knife handles as ijf you put them in the dish washer the finish comes off.
4,knife set,"I never valued good knives until i purchesed this set. knife sets are either very cheap or very expensive, this is the best set for the money i have come across. Skeptal at first i bought one set . After trying them i bought 3 sets for my Kids.David Mckool"
2,Poor quality steel,"At the greatly reduced price, I consider the knives ok. If I had paid the advertised retail price, I'd be calling an attorney! These knives are dull and do not sharpen well. I'm not a beginner when it comes to sharpening either -- I usually get excellent results from quality steel and I use a professional knife sharpener. I've not had a problem with rust because I wash by hand and dry just like they recommend. The weight and balance are what you would expect from medium quality knives. However, they arrive dull and stay that way."
1,Horrible,"I am used to buying Henkels knives and I fell for the gold box value for these knives. Believe me, these knives are for people who dont know how to cook or just need a set of knives in yoru kitchen. The knives started to rust and I have put them back in their package and hopefully never use them again. I bought a nice henkel knife that was missing from my collection and i'm all set...stay away from these low quality knives."
1,Don't waste your money! Does [web page] back products they sell?,"I am extremely disappointed with these knives! They are absolutely horrible. They are dull, awkward to handle, and already rusting, even tho I have taken extra care when drying them. I have used the paring knife a few times, more out of necessity than anything, and the wood handle is already discolored and looking as though it's ready to splinter! I have only had this knife set out of the box two weeks. A decent set of knives is something I have been wanting to purchase for quite some time, and I was so excited to see these on your site. This purchase leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth, (could that be rusty metal?) and makes me wonder about future purchases. Does [web page] stand behind these purchases?"
2,I should listened to the other reviews...,"How could this possibly retail for $225? The most expensive part of this set is probably the block that holds the knives. The knives can't be worth too much. Well, you get what you pay for, and now I have a 14-piece stainless steel reminder of this fact..."
2,Get what you pay for,"I was looking forward to a good deal/ a good Sabatier stainless steel knife set.What I got was:1) Thin blades that do not hold an edge.2) These are actually not stamped stainless.3) Lots of rust spots even with good care (within two weeks.4) Look like I spent money on garbage bag filler.Not a deal in my opinion.On the plus side, you can pay more money for worse quality sets if you look hard."
1,Junk,"Well, I have Sabatier set made in France and it is beautiful. I've assumed that this one is French-made as well and was wrong. This one is made in China and quality is really bad. It is well may be that this is not really Sabatier - even labels on the blades are not well stamped."
2,too dull,"straight edge knives were very dull, and they don't take a sharpening well or keep it past one good use.the steak knives are okay since they are serated. the kitchen scissors are kitchen scissors. wouldn't use them for anything else like sewing.take your money and but one good knive like a wustoff. you'll be far happier."
2,Poor quality finish,The actual knife quality is excellent but the wood finish comes off with the first hand washing. Would suggest getting the black finish unless you want to plan on splinters.
3,Middle of the road,"These aren't bad for the price you pay. You will need to maintain them and they do dull very quickly requiring constant sharpening. Have no illusions, you aren't getting world class cutlery for this price but, used and maintained well they will serve their purpose adequately."
1,Sabatier 14 piece knife set with 15 slot block,The idea of selling a 14 pc. set of knives with a holder that has15 slots is unreal. From day one it looks like a piece is missing from the set. In addition the blades are showing signs of discoloring and rust. Over all I am not pleased with this purchase.
1,You get what you pay for.....,You get what you pay for with these knifes. They have plastic handles. They rust.On the positive side - they cut your food!If I were in college (or you only need the bare minimum) - these would the great.If your a discerning adult - skip this item.
4,A great gift.,I bought this item for my mothers birthday and she has told me nothing but good things about it. I have not seen the knives ao that is why I cannot give it a 5. But I've been told that these knives excellent.
2,Missing the slicer!,"Knife set is a great value for the price however missing the slicer in both the sets that I ordered in December. So, only have 13 items. Not sure what to do next but wanted to share this information with potential buyers."
2,Does it's job,"I read many reviews of this product before we bought one. I'm not completely satisfied but what do you expect when it's relatively cheap in price.The facts with these knives:1) With moderate use, they dull pretty quickly.2) The sharpener is garbage unless you feel like spending all day sharpening your knives.3) Knives WILL rust. After washing, dry immediately otherwise rust will develop."
1,Don't buy cheap,"This set worked fine for a couple months then, the steak knives could only tear at meat. Save your money for a good set, I haven't found one yet."
1,There's a reason why these knives are priced so low,"I purchased my set of knives for [a pretty low price]. I've been using them for less than a year, and basically, they suck. They already have rust spots - amazing when you consider that we only wash them by hand! The paring and chef's knives are dull, and the scissors - well let's just say that they leave a lot to be desired. The last set I owned was purchased at a huge discount store about 12 years ago for all of $10. I unfortunately gave these to my sister when I got this ""precision"" set and they still work."
2,"rust, poor quality steel, poor quality wooden block","well, they're cheap, that is true.However, I would expect a little bit more than knives that rust after one week of use and that are too heavy to handle...I would expect a better finished wooden block, that even has missing spot!?I'm OK with my purchase because I paid a really low price for them, but if you need to get a good set of knives, don't buy this one."
2,Rusty,"I thought I was getting a bargin, nice sharp knives. But you better have plenty of Steel Wool to clean the Rust off if you plan on washing them. I guess I'll buy steel products that are made in the USA from now on, China steel just can't cut the Mustard. Amazon would do well by telling us where their products come from."
3,A little rust won't hurt!,Cheap$$ knives and cheap knives. Yes these knives will rust. The best thing out of the set are the siccors! They alone are worth 10 bucks to me! They cut great! BUYER BEWARE: IF YOU ARE ALERGIC TO RUST DO NOT USE
4,"Ugly Block, Value Priced Knives","Yep, the picture does not do justice to how ugly the block that holds these knives truly is.However, for the price, the knives are unbeatable. Each knife has a fine look to the blade and is nicely balanced. The cutting shears do good work and the knife sharpener is an added bonus.One curiosity with this set is the fact that there are 14 slots in the ugly block and only 13 knives (the block unfortunately counting as the 14th piece to the set). Is Sabatier suggesting that the buyer of this set go out and buy one more knife to gain closure for all the slots in the block? I wonder..."
5,I love these knives!,"I'm not sure what people are complaning about. The quality is great and the knives are sharp...even if they were made in China and not France. The knives are easily sharpened when they become dull, but I didn't find the need to do that very often. I'm not a professional chef, but I'm a happy homemaker who is very satisfied with these knives!"
1,Rusts,Very hard to keep from rusting. Not 250.00 knifes to begin with...dont know where they come up with that price. Also 40.00 is not worth it if they rust.
2,There's Sabatier and then there is Sabatier,"If you are expecting the reputation and quality of Sabatier France when you are buying this product, you will be very disappointed. There is more than one company named Sabatier making knives worldwide and they have nothing to do with one another. (This comes down to the complicated law of international trademarks.) So this is not a case of THE Sabatier manufacturing a less expensive product in China. It is a different company and you may just get what you pay for...."
2,Should have followed my instincts...,"Yes, this price IS too good to be true. I just returned them, and now I'm out roughly $... for shipping them both ways. The knives look impressive, and the block is fine quality. The handles were even comfortable, but they are SO DULL! I realize they come with a sharpening steel, but please... my cheap-o set came out of the box sharp enough to cut paper cleanly. I tried to cut a butternut squash and ended up having much better success with [something else]."
2,not so great,"I was quite disappointed in the knife set I received. I am definitely not a ""knife snob."" I currently use Chicago Cutlery knives and think they do fairly well. The Sabatier set is incredibly dull. I know how to sharpen knives and haven't put the Sabatier knives in the dishwasher. I was trying to cut a Granny Smith apple and found that it was incredibly difficult to cut with my Sabatier set. I pulled out my old abused Chicago Cutlery knife which has been through the dishwasher a hundred times, quickly sharpened it and it cut through the same apple with complete ease. My brand new Sabatier knives which were just sharpened with the same tool barely got through the apple. By the way there is an empty slot in the block, why? The steak knives are nice and the sharpener works well on other knives, so I'd say it's worth 25 dollars, but not much more. They'd be fine for your first ever knife set."
2,OK for the price.,"Not a quality knife set. This could be a nice affordable starter set for those who do not need a decent chef's knife. I bought this without reading any of the reviews. Although this is not what I was looking to purchase, I will keep this set as a reminder to read reviews before I purchase anything online. I'm sure I can find use for some of these LOW quality knives. I think I'll put a new high quality knife in the extra slot provided, I'm sure that's why it is there! And replace the steel too!"
2,these sabatier knives ...!,"Once a prestigious name in cutlry, Sabatier's name is nowused by importer of cheap knives from eitherKorea or China,Neither country has learned thefineart of metalurgy and the blades, though stamped (rather than forged) from ""stainless steel are both too soft to hold a lasting edge, too coarse to even acquire a ""razor-sharp edge and rust resistance is questionable( though handwashing and immediatedrying is always reccommended for finecutlery. ..."
2,You get what you pay for.,I thought I was getting a great deal here. I don't cook or use knives to much. But it would have been nice to have received the complete set. I got a 13 pieces instead of 14 -- I have an empty knife slot which doesn't look nice. Not too happy with this purchase.
1,Junk,I just bought a set and it turned out to be not useful. I'd rather throw them into garbage can.
5,"SAVE 88% ON KITCHEN WARE? check this out, can't beat it....",I personally have purchased and owned a set of knives with the wooden holder and was very satisfied with the purchase. The only thing is I spent alot of money for a GOOD set of knives. You can't pass this up...88% savings passed on to you.Customers have also bought some of the great savings listed.
1,They were sharp...,"I bought this set hoping to get a set of good quality knives. While they were sharp once they came out of the box, they have quickly gotten dull. I've had the knife set about 3 months and they are definitely not as sharp as they used to be. When I bought them, they could cut through meat easily, now, the knives just shred the meat and cutting is horrible."
5,WONDERFUL set of knives,"We bought this set for my sister in law. She needed a set, and this one looks to be of high quality. For the money spent, we couldn't have chosen a better set. And, it comes with steak knives, which is always a bone of contention with me. I can usually find good knives, but finding good steak knives is harder."
1,Extremly dissapointing,"I received my set of knives today, or rather, a partial set of knives. The knives I did receive looked worn and pitted, with the Sabatier logo partially worn off on several of them. They were also extremely dull. And the block is equally pitiful - rough, unfinished texture, with uniformly-sized slots which are too large for all of the knives. The old knives I was planning to retire are in much better condition than this new set of junk.It is not worth for the price."
4,"Good value, not very sharp","Good value for the money, if you know how to sharpen a knife this set is for you.I bought this set, and I was a little disappointed initially about how dull they were, I put in use my best sharpening skills and I am very happy with them now. For home use this is the best set you can get, yes they are not made in France as you might expected, they are made in China but this days with globalization we should not get surprised"
2,So So.....,"Decent construction, but pretty dull. I don't care for the empty slot in the block either."
1,Not worth the price,"I bought this after reading some previously glowing reviews about the set. It doesn't hold an edge, and if you are in a hard water area, it spots readily. Don't waste your money. I finally did what I should have done originally and bought three very useful Henckel's knives for approximately $100, that I will have for many years. You truly get what you pay for."
4,curious,"I purchased these knives a little over a month ago and use them every day. I haven't had a rusting problem, and my knives are quite sharp and cut fine, probibly because I know how to use the sharpening steel. I don't put the knives in the dishwasher! These knives have been at the top of the sales list on this web site for quite some time, I'm sure a lot of them have been sold and I suspect there are more people satisfied with them than some of the horrible reviews would indicate. I think the majority of average consumers don't write reviews on the internet, only the more sophisticated ones who tend to be more discriminating and critical . However, I am curious and have to ask this question, with such a wide range of opinions in the reviews of these knives, did we all get the same knives? In other words is there a consistency problem with the manufacturer? Some of the damming reviews here don't discribe the knives that I have, and I don't doubt the sincerity of any reviewer."
1,14 piece cutlery set,I rated this product one star only because that was the lowest rating available I could give it. This product does not represent the quality Sabatier product I have used in the past.I could not believe that I could purchase [an expensive] cutlery set for [so little.] If a deal sounds too good to be true it usually is. Such is the case with this set of knives. In addition the kitchen shears were missing when the set was delivered to me. Please do not waste your money on this set of knives!!
1,Dull and being returned,"I wasn't expecting much in the way of quality at this price but I thought it would be suitable for a rental property I own. I was surprised by how dull the knives were on arrival - I couldn't even cut through a tomato and slicing an onion was out of the question. My cheap, Taiwanese-made Faberware chef's knife, bought for a couple bucks at a retail outlet, beat the pants off the chef's knife included in this set. It's junk, at any price, and will be returned. Sabatier should be ashamed of sullying their brand name on this."
2,It isn't REALLY on sale!!,"I bought my sabatier precision knives 2 years ago, same price they have now! It's not a sale! It's a total farse and the product isn't worth the wasted time. When we purchased these knives I thought I was getting a 'steal' of a sale on some quality NAME BRAND knives. I was utterly conned. The knives don't stay sharp, they handles are cheaply made and let water in causing rust even if you hand dry the blade. The steak knives work well, as does the bread knife and scissors. But the rest is terrible. Our paring knife's tip broke off while trying to cut an APPLE. Alas, I am a cheapo and continue to resharpen and use these knives. Don't get fooled by the ""sale"""
1,"Cheaply made, dull...",I have a large set of the Sabatier Au Carbone (carbon steel) knives from France and decided to pick this set up for my second kitchen. I do a great deal of entertaining and cooking and thought these might be nice as a backup. What a shock when I opened the box and saw these knives. Sight alone told me they were junk. The Sabatier logo was poorly printed on the blades. I tried to slice a tomato and some cold chicken with each knife as a test. As dull as butter knives from the box. And no amount of work with a stone or steel could bring a decent edge to them. These are NOT real Sabatier and should not be confused as such. Don't waste your money on these. Buy one or two REAL Sabatier knives (Provence is a good line) for a little more and you will be much happier. It's a real shame that these knives continue to be sold and help to ruin the reputation of the real Sabatier
4,I've had no problems,"These were on sale for something like forty bucks, so it is hard to complain. So far I'm happy. The knives have an edge, they keep an edge, and no signs of rust... three months and counting. But I've been keeping them out of the dishwasher just in case.I could be happier with the handles (look at the picture, and you can see, you can't use the back of the blade without squishing your fingers against the cutting board.Complaints about the block are understandable... it is not as solid as some. But it is a minor compaint. It looks fine and serves its purpose.Overall, I'm pretty darned happy, and I imagine I'll be using these for the next ten years with no problems. Not bad for forty bucks."
3,ok,"i received this set yesterday and started using the biggest knife. It is dull. the rest of the knives are quite sharp and contrary to some other reviewers who said the blades are thin, the set i got are well made. Except for the 1 dull knife, i would buy the set again."
1,Please do not buy this set,"My friend bought an inexpensive set of Sabatier here on Amazon and likes hers just fine. I bought this set last year because it was on sale and seemed like a great value.I regretted the decision after about a week. They weren't ever sharp, they don't *stay* sharp, they rust and discolor. Terrible terrible quality. Will never buy Sabatier again, even the expensive lines."
3,MADE IN CHINA,"When I read the French sounding name, I assumed I was buying European goods. When I got the set, I see they are made in China. The Chinese workmanship is about what I would expect: Crude and semi-finished, unpolished, with grinding marks and nicks. The imporant honing steel item was broken.In fairness, this is a forged stainless knife set, but you get what you pay for. This is no way comparable to a $500 forged knife set."
3,Sabatier Review,"Great for the price, but must be handwashed;not stainless steel so will get a little rust in the dishwasher."
5,NOT Stainless Steel,"I have not bought these knives--just wanted to let you unhappy purchasers know that ANY high carbon steel knife WILL rust!!They MUST be cared for properly--i.e. washed and dried by hand after use. High carbon steel knifes will maintain sharpness better than stainless ones also.If you want knifes to just toss in the sink then buy STAINLESS STEEL ONES!!I will be buying this set, soon!"
1,The Wooden block is nice....,"The Chef's knife is terrible. I put it away and store my Henckels in its place. The knife is very heavy, unbalanced and doesn't cut well. None of them do, actually. I suppose the steak knives are acceptable....although I bought better ones at Albertson's years ago, for 99 cents each. The sharpening steel is terrible.... the scissors are okay. Even the paring knife could be better. Fortunately, I only paid 29.99.............."
2,rusty stainless,"The knives seem to be well made and balanced. However, they stain VERY easily. It looks like rust and is very difficult to remove, even with steel wool. I just bought them, but my wife wants to replace them"
1,"Cheap price, cheap knives","When I saw this set of knives I did think the price was too good to be true but let good reviews fool me into buying. The knives arrived and all were horrible, thick bladed knives that change directions as you're cutting! They couldn't even cut decently through a tomato.There are a couple of good things about this product though: the scissors are excellent and the block is handsome and sturdy.I've had my share of cheap dull knives as well as expensive professional ones and belief that when it comes to knives you really get what you pay for."
2,They Weren't Even Sharp Out of the Box!!!,"I kind of agree with everybody who gave these knives a bad rating. They came out of the box duller than a butter knife. I've been spending some time sharpening them, and hopefully they will hold an edge. I'm disappointed in them though. I thought they would be a lot nicer, but what do you expect for about [the price]? Next time I'll fork out the dough and get a nicer Henkels set. Oh well, live and learn."
1,Poor quality,"The price listed is $240. You have got to be kidding me. No person in their right mind would ever purchase thes knives for $17 if they were able to see them in person.These knives are not sharp or even balanced well. They feel and look cheap. I find the handles awkward and uncomfortable. I was expecting a higher quality product with such a high retail price. These knives are poor quality at best in my opinion, but you will be able to cut potatoes and carrots with them."
3,Again with the slots,"Just had to add, if you would read the description:Knives included: 8"" chef, 8"" slicer, 8"" bread, 6"" utility, and 3-1/2"" paring8"" sharpening steel, kitchen shears, and six 5"" steak knives in a 14 slot wood blockIt SAYS there is a 14 slot wood block, and if you COUNT how many knives are described there are only 13. So, you should have expected the block to have an extra slot. I've seen some blocks sold this way so that you can add another type knife to your collection later and have a spot for it."
4,You get what you pay for,"I bought these just over 6 months ago. The knives didn't bend or break but they get some few rust spots here and there after being washed. Well, considering I paid $13 for the set (it was on Friday Sale), it's well worth the money. For $24 (the price now) I wouldn't consider it just because I've seen this exact set at TJ Maxx for $16.Generally, if you don't necessarily want to be too ""cool"" but just need something that would do the job and look decent, it's not a bad choice."
2,BEWARE!!!,"Company says reason one knife is missing is because 14 piece set means 13 knives and 1 knife block. Therefore, one knife is missing and the block has a vacant slot. In my case, the missing knife is the 8"" slicer which I would probably use alot. I emailed the company and they said this had never happened to them before and if I returned the set they would refund my money. However, to return the set would cost as much as I paid for the set to begin with. It is certainly a case of ""getting what you pay for""!!!. Signed, Unhappy"
3,Ignorance!,"Learn to use knives folks!! A dishwasher will ruin handles, the finish, and the edge of the blade!! If you wash chef's knives in the dishwasher, your opinion on the subject is simply invalid! If you use Faberware as a standard for a ""good"" knife, you have something to learn. With proper care, and a knowledgeable user, these knives should work FINE for daily tasks. If you demand excellence, buy a set of extemely high quality knives for about 10 times the price!"
1,You get what you pay for,"These knives are terrible. The soft, poor quality of steel used will not hold a sharp edge for any length of time. I'm not talking about if you put them in the dishwasher (never put knives in a dishwasher...), I'm talking about if you actually cut anything with them, the blades immediately dull, and a dull knife is an accident waiting to happen. I bought some cheap Chefmate knives some years back which are getting ratty so I bought these to replace them, but the Chefmate ones blow these away. I ended up buying a couple of good quality knives individually because I couldn't use these.The up side is that the block is ok, the scisors are handy and the steak knives are serrated, so don't actually need to be sharp. If 4 steak knives, a wood block and a good pair of kitchen scisors are woth the price, then by all means go for it, and replace the other knives with something better."
2,"functional, but there is something missing","Firstly, there is an extra slot in the wood block. Don't go crazy looking for the missing knife and re-counting everything 5,000 times -- it's not there. There are 13 knives, 1 block=14 pieces.Second, I cut an onion with one, and it stained the blade! What is that all about?And now, 5 months later -- almost all the knives aer stained!The knives are functional at the price...but not for over...!!! I was disappointed as this was my first ever ""nice"" knife block set."
2,Not all the pieces were included,I purchased this for a gift and when it was opened one of the larger knives was not included. Now it is past the 3 month return window so it looks like an exchange is not going to be easy
1,I was misled!,The number of knives I expected to recieved was misrepresented on the details. Where are my other two pairing knives?!
3,understanding the cutting edge,wondering what describes the blade other than sharp...the price is g--r--e--a--t if it is all it is cut out to be
3,Seems Like Cutco only cheaper and not so good,"If anyone is familiar with the Cutco brand of knives, these have some features that they do. I will tell you now that I have never owned these knives, but the full tang/rivet thing is a good thing to have on a knife. I own (and used to sell) Cutco and I know what is good about these knives just from the picture. The blade looks like it will do good for a while but may derode. As I said before, I have never owned these knives."
1,This is the worse set of knifes I have ever bought,these were dull out of the box and they are all rusting. Very disappointed in this purchase save your money and get a better set. I am already looking for a new set.
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I bought this set based on the Sabatier name, the price, and the great customer reviews. My set has been in use for about a month, and none of the knives have ever been in a dishwasher. The two larger ones (which have seen the most use) have RUST! Unbelievable! They have spots on the blades that no amount of scrubbing will displace, and the chopping knife has a distinct line of rust where the blade meets the handle. Keep in mind, this is a virtually NEW set. These knives are made in China. The Sabatier name means nothing in this case, except perhaps a total loss of prestige in my eyes. These are cheap knives. My Martha Stewart K-Mart chopping knife which I bought around the same time is holding up better than these. Come to think of it, I don't recall ever having a ""stainless steel"" knife rust on me. This is my first Amazon review, but I really felt I had to put in my 2 cents here, in order to warn others not to make the same mistake I did."
2,Very disappointed!,"I am very disappointed with my set of knives. I boutht two sets, one as a gift to a friend, the other one for myself. What a big surprise I got when opened up my set and found only 13 knives! The 8 inch slicer is missing! And a bigger surprise, my friend's set is the same! With the 8 inch slicer missing!! I like the looks and feel of the knives, but there is an extra hole in the block!Besides, you have to sharpen the knives BEFORE you used them, because they are dull!"
2,Decorator Knives: Not the real Steel,"This a really great looking knife set! Unfortunately, knives are only as good as the steel they are made of. These knives neither take nor hold an edge. They fail the tomato test at their sharpest. Their balance is wrong because their steel is thicker than it would be if it were a higher grade. These are commodity knives with a designer name."
2,"Low price, low quality","You get what you pay for with this set of knives. The blades are dull and the steel is low quality. My package showed up with a couple of knives handles broken, which gave me a good reason to return it. Amazon first gave me only 2/3 of the purchase price back, but I complained and they refunded the residual."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!,Do not get fleeced on this product......I bought this six months ago and am now throwing it out. It is total crap!
2,Junk,"Believe me, it is impossible to get 14 decent knives for this price. It is impossible to get a decent knife block and 14 junky knives for this price. what you get is a junky block and 14 junky knives. the steel is stamped from a too-thin piece of steel. They do NOT hold an edge at all. Take the money you are thinking of spending on these and buy ONE decent 8"" FORGED chef's knife. You can get one for the same price as this set or less. I don't know why I believed the positive reviews of these knives. I'm usually a firm believer in you get what you pay for. These are junk and I'm now replacing them one by one. Don't do the same thing."
1,Sabatier Precision knife set,I would not buy this crap or tell anyone to buy this set. It does not stay sharp. I guess that is what I get for buying something as little at 10 dollars. I should have know better. Do Not Buy any of these Kniefs.
1,THEY RUST DON'T BUY!!!!,these things are cool to look at but don't wash them cause they rust after 3 washes!!!!they suck
2,Not what it appears to be online-,"I was disappointed and somewhat embarrassed with the purchase of this knife set. I gave it to my husband as a Christmas gift after buying it online. Online, the knife set was advertised as being something like 90% off the original price- I bought the set for $9.99. (I bought it for my husband because I thought it would be a great set to replace the various mixed matched knives that he had put together as a set.) After opening the gift, my husband asked me how much I paid for it. I was reluctant to tell him, but he then informed me that it was a fairly cheap knife set and there was no way he could replace his current set with the Sabatier one- and he hoped I didn't pay a lot for it. It is a BASIC knife set that is probably worth exactly what I paid for it: $9.99."
1,Garbage,"Those of you who said that these knives were garbage are right. They do rust and they are not that sharp. After hand washing them and drying them, I did not dry them off well enough and they did rust. Certainly not a product that I would recommend to anyone. You truly do get what you pay for. I was very dissatisifed with this product and am now very aware of bargains that are too good to be true."
1,not sharp at all,I bought these knives for my husband for xmas.They are terrible.Don't waste your money.
2,Rage and frustration,"Can you imagine the rage and frustration of the marketing guys when they started to get reports that some of the kits in the containers they had ordered from China were not complete! What to do with all that stuff??? The retail outlets wouldn't touch it! Sell it on Amazon.""com. Would have been nice if they had said that some of the kits might be missing a knife.I decided not to return it, I got ""my"" moneys worth"
3,Great beginner set for teaching knife techniques,"I am a professional chef with an extensive and expensive knife collection. I've been volunteer teaching culinary skills to middle school students and needed good quality, inexpensive knives. I ordered two sets of these knives primarily because of the unbelievable price and was surprised at the quality.You do need to sharpen them periodically but the weight and balance are good and they do hold up- even after use by over-zealous sixth graders!"
3,Okay for the price...,"The price is great for the quality, but these knives are heavy and not well balanced. The steel is fine, but I prefer a whetstone. Worth the price I paid, but I would never pay the full retail on these."
3,Worth the clearance price,"I ordered these knives and ended up reading the reviews afterwards. Most ofthe bad reviews have to do with the knives getting ruined in the dishwasher. I agree with the others -- Mama told me to never put knives in the dishwasher.They are definately not worth the retail price. I think the high price is there as a marketing ploy. But they are worth more than the clearance price. The funny think I noticed is that there's an extra space in the block. It makes you feel that a knife is missing but I did a count and all are there.The larger knives have a very poor balance -- but the small ones are good. This is a good starter set, or good if you cant afford a true high-priced set (which is why I bought them). Some of them are dull out of the box, but the included knife sharpener fixes that.you get what you pay for -- dont expect a set that the best chefs in the world use, but it's not too bad of a deal."
1,Why you shouldn't buy these,"I realize the price is cheap enough, but trust me when I say that you get what you pay for. I have had these for two weeks now and they are already rusting. I have had even cheaper knives for several years that didn't even think of rusting. With the name, I expected a fairly well balanced knife that would hold an edge, what I got was a set of dull knives from the factory that rust when you wash them in the dishwasher. Save you money and buy a little nicer set if you just have to have some new knives."
1,Better off with ...[another],"These knives stink. They are made of low quality steel and rust the first time they are washed.... Stay away from them, you would be better off with just about anything else."
3,"decent knives, pathetic block","These will be the knives you keep in the drawer, not on the counter for show. They seem decently sharp, and the handles look good for being plastic. ... Don't expect a lot. you'll get a few good knives that will do the cutting job. If you're looking for that sweet set you can proudly display to impress the neighbors, this set is definitely not it. The block is made from particle board and plywood..."
2,You Get What You Pay For -- This is No Exception,"Don't be misled by the Sabatier name, here. These are [low priced] imports trading off of a name license (note ""Sabatier Precision""). Why this fine knife-maker would tarnish its name with these subgrade knives is anybody's guess. In practicality, these knives are no different from the non-serrated sets one would see at ..other discount stores for about the same (discounted) price seen here. The materials are simply passable, the handles okay. The blades are made of thin, [low priced] steel that do not hold an edge. Forget the honing tool that comes with this set-- you will need a sharpening stone to repeatedly add an edge to these knives. Even then, this will not last beyond a few uses. This set may whet your appetite for the feel of a good, heavy, well-gripped and balanced knife, but you will have to look elsewhere for one that actually stays sharp and does what it is supposed to do."
1,I know it looks like a great deal- but DON'T DO IT!,"Based on previous reviews, I wasn't expecting the same Sabatier knives you would get for the 'suggested retail price' at Williams-Sonoma. But I also wasn't expecting knives that wobble on their handles, rust if they're not wiped completely dry after hand-washing, and lose their edge almost immediately. Save the $$ and buy some real knives one at a time, if you have to."
1,You get what you pay for,"Or, in this case, perhaps a little less. Cheesy block, and the steak knives rusted on my first use. If anyone figures out what the extra slot in the block is for, please let me know ..."
2,You get what you pay for....,"Hey, how much can you complain for a 14 piece knife set for [$$]? Technically, not that much I would think.However, these knives actually do not perform to the level of more expensive knives. They work fine as a [$$] set, but don't expect high performance from these...knives. So far mine have rusted substantially and do not hold an edge well.I'm not disappointed with the purchase at all-- I wasn't expecting a set of Henckels-- and as long as you keep your expectations low they are a fine value."
5,Excellent Value for the Money!,"The knives featured here are good, basic knives that are very good but require more care than some of their more fancy counterparts. I would advise oiling the wood handles before use and repeating on a regular basis. The steel is soft, so give the knives a good whetting before each use.I'm rating these knives five stars because of the value. They don't have nearly as many bells and whistles as most of the popular knife sets, but for one-person kitchens or for a starter set, they can't be beat! I can't think of anywhere else that you're going to find such a large set of basic yet reasonably good quality knives for the money."
1,"Sharp, but not very stainless","Knives are sharp, but they are not stainless as advertised. I bought them less than a month ago and they are already starting to rust. Also, the smooth finish on the handle wears out after few washes as well as the fastener are coming lose.don't get this knife set. Buy another, even if you have to pay a little more. It'll save you time."
5,Great knives for the price.,"These a really good knives for this price. Starting a new kitchen or just need some back-up knives and this set is for you. They are strudy, sharp, and attractive. I have read some of the other reviews about missing knives and think some people are miscounting. Perhaps they are missing knives I don't know that for sure, but I suspect they have forgotten to count the knife block as the 14th piece. Other knife sets at this price just pale in comparison. As a semi-recent collage grad and someone starting a new kitchen from scratch, I know because I have owned some of them."
3,More of for decoration than cutting purpose,"I waited so long to replace my old knife, so I finally got this set. It looked great, and almost like real deal to have all 14 pieces. But I got to keep my old knife as it chops vegetables better. If you need some knifes just to decorate the kitchen, this is the one."
3,Knives are what you'd expect,"The knives are what you'd expect for the [money], maybe a bit better. They aren't spectacular, but they cut pretty decently for someone who doesn't cook all the time. They did not have rust spots when I received them; however, they show a marked tendency to develop rust spots if left to soak in water for a short time, or if left to air dry!!! I would not recommend buying this set if you don't want to hand-dry knives after every wash."
1,Dont waste your money,"The set I purchased was sharp enough for the price, but stainless steel is NOT supposed to rust inside a month (which it did). When it sounds too good to be true...it probably is."
3,One week review,"I read some of the reviews posted by Amazon.com before I ordered. Iconsidered it a crap shoot, but what the heck I've blown lots more the $30. on junk before.After a week, I'm not that disappointed. I read all the one wordreviews and how these things are next to scap metal.In reality you get what you pay for. Sure the $240 list is a jokebut $30. they are worth it. If your expecting $500 Henkels forget it but they seem serviceable. They haven't rusted yet orfallen apart. The staight edge knives are not very sharp and theshapening tool is not very good. I'll see if they can hold an edge from a stone. If your not expecting the bargain of the century orare a serious pro then they will do.Randy G"
1,[Poorly made] knives from china..better think twice,[Poorly made] product...knife can be scratched sponge used for dish washing. total waste of money!
3,Not too bad,"I expected better quality from Sabatier but what I got was what I paid for. It works okay with light preparations but very cumbersome for cutting meat or if you have a lot of preparations to do. If you're looking for a complete set without looking to spend a lot of money, this one is it. The weight is good but the handle design is awkward and the edges are not very sharp."
5,relevence,"In a time when being republican is associated with christianity, it is refreshing to hear a story of a democrat who stood for the christianity that upholds the downtrodden.This author does a beautiful job of using WJB as a symbol for how politics like religion is not black and white. There are different views and strategies by men on both sides. About WJB Lawrence Levine writes ""a liberal in one area may be a conservative in another not only at the same time but also for the same reasons.""This book was beautifully written and will make whoever reads it think twice about labeling people based on their political affiliations."
2,The Great Commoner?,"So.. While this book does have a great deal of very important and useful information, it is boring, and dry! The book is about the life of Wiliam Jennings Bryan, a 3 time presidential loser, who lectured on social reform, and free silver across the nation. He is said to be most known for helping the ""the little people"" but i'm still questioning what, if anything, of significant importance did he ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH for these ""commoners""? He may have planted the seed of some great ideas but i don't see much evidence of his helping their growth."
1,does not do what it say s on the tin....,"firstly i have not purchased this mat, nor would i. the company describes it as being 100% jute and in the next line says its blended with rubber ! how is this environmentally friendly ? it seems anything that someone can tag as being friendly to the earth is getting that way...... 'oh its biodegradable... well lets call it environmentally friendly, no it doesnt matter that we used chemicals to make it' !!"
2,Disappointed....not as much fun for my son as I had hoped...,"I was so excited to buy this, but my two year old son has not taken to it. I also bought the Little Touch animals book at the same time, and he has enjoyed that one immensely. But for some reason he ignores the Mr. Brown book.He likes funny noises, and Mr. Brown's noises are not that funny. Most of them seem to be spoken by a person, rather than silly sounds. There are not a lot of pictures to push on each page, so my son gets bored quickly.The story is good, so I think he may enjoy it when he gets older but right now it is a dud."
4,"A decent story, but needs more content...","Picked this up for my one-year-old daughter for Christmas. She enjoyed it insofar as her attention span would allow, which is about ten minutes a pop, but it wasn't her favorite LeapPad Little Touch. She also didn't have as much fun using it alone, so really it is something that she does with my wife or I.It is pretty faithful to Dr. Seuss, but as the other commentator notes, it doesn't go that extra mile. What's included is fun and entertaining, but there could have been a little more content given the money you're shelling out."
2,Lacking color,My least favorite game for the Little Touch. The story and features are okayish but has as much color on the book as the traditional Seuss books.
4,Fun!,"Now you can play your own guitar or piano to Laurie's songs. How fun is that? Great stuff!!!! Only one thing kept me from giving it five stars: The binding is really third rate on the book and the pages almost literally come out by just opening it up! ?? That really needs to be fixed...Otherwise, just great and thanks to Laurie for creating such fun songs for our kids (and the adults like the ""free time"" while they're watching the DVD or watching Noggin's music!)!!"
3,Not Updated for Recent Editions of Premiere Pro,"Despite claims in the product description and by the author, this edition does not appear to be updated for CS3 or CS4. Additional examples that there has been no recent update: there's no mention of Youtube and HD is considered a recent and very minor technology. Despite the lack of current information, the book is still very useful for anyone starting out with Premiere Pro. As others have stated, the book is written with the beginner in mind and assumes that the reader has little knowledge of video or video editing.For those with more experience, I would recommend that you skip this book and consider one from the ""Bible"" series."
3,Mistakenly bought,"I thought this book would be useful for the current version of Premiere Pro. It's not. IT was written for a much older version. This is my mistake, of course. I should have looked at the publication date."
5,Xtreme Xtreme release,This group is a must get!!!! I'd you love Bachata and or R & B. With a Cuban blend then you've got to check this group out...
5,The Simpsons season 10!!!!!!!!!,"I am an extremely big Simpsons fan. I own seasons 1 through 9, both the X-mas ones and Bart Wars. My favorite seasons, although its very hard to choose, would have to be 4, 5, or 6.What I dont like is how the simpsons now on fox has that ""perfect animation"" and childish humor. It's hard to discribe. The humor is still funny for season 10, but it doesnt have the good ole Simpsons feel like 1-9.It is definintly worth the buy thoughAnd this is abviously not the artwork for the cover. It's just a poster for it until the real artwork for the simpsons season Ten is released from the dvd people. I dont like the heads anyway, the boxes are more colorful and just look cooler."
4,Fan Of The Simpsons But Up To A Point,I like so many others have grown up with the Simpsons and while I still carefor them my love for the show has diminished somewhat.I have gotten all the seasons up to 10 and feel like a few others this was the pinnacle of the series you should let a show run only so long and I feel that this series after season 12 has lost it's way.I do not mean to upset any fans so that is why I say this is my personal opinion on this I loved the show up until the point of S12 where it seems that the writers just tried any ludicrous thing to keep the show running so all I say is if you are just getting into this series go for the seasons up to 10 than watch the other seasons on tv and see if those are worth you're choice of getting later on when they are released.
5,"Amazing at ten, still great at nineteen","This is another great season of the best show on television bar none (much better than Family Guy ever has been) This season features some great moments and memorable characters. From Homer adopting a lobster named Pinchy to Ned and Homer's Vegas wives, this season remains fresh and as hilarious as it ever has been. Make no mistake, this season is still in the prime of The Simpsons. It is not, as many indicate, the downwards spiral of the series or the last great season. Personally, I still think The Simpsons is still great at nineteen. Whoo-hoo for season ten."
5,The Simpson's Movie gift purchase,I can't personally review the movie since I haven't seen it but it was a gift for my son for Christmas and he loved it. He has watched it several times already.
2,It has begun,"As an avid viewer of Simpsons over the years, I find myself trying to pinpoint when my interest in the show began waning. There are many people who point to a certain season as the one that was the ""last good season."" I have purchased every season so far as they have been released and I must say this season ten is the first that I haven't watched completely through in under a week. I can't exactly put my finger on why; just that the quality of the episodes just hasn't left me with the urge to keep watching this season. I'll either pick up a magazine in the middle of an episode or just stop watching all together. Don't get me wrong, there are still some good laughs in some episodes, but nothing compared to earlier seasons, and for the price, I am just not compelled to highly recommend this season of Simpsons."
3,"Good, But Not Great","I own seasons 6,7,8,9 and 10 and 10 is easily my least favorite. The first four are amazing seasons and have watched each at 2-3 times. I finished watching season 10 a few days ago and I am not impressed like the others.The story focus is significantly altered in season 10 and involves mainly Homer and his stupid antics (much like the new ones) instead of stories that significantly include everyone in the family. The episodes' narratives seem much lazier than past seasons and feature amazing variety of characters less.I still enjoyed the set since I am a big Simpsons fan but much less than the ones I already own. If you are new to the sets I would go with any from 6-9 before moving on to 10+."
3,This is when things went downhill,"Since I was 7 ive been watching the simpsons and now im 26 so ive been watching the show way too long lol When I started buying the season dvds I fell back in love with the show, seeing some episodes that never seem to be on tv. Now that I own all 11 seasons you can see where the simpsons started to loose its shine...Theres 2 unwatchable episodes in this season, sunday cruddy sunday and monty cant buy me love, and a few other episodes that are funny, but the jokes were getting much more cornier and the stories werent as good. I remember this being the season that I stopped watching every sunday and since then i havent seen a whole season...but no matter what this show will always be my favorite."
3,The begining of the end,This is truly where The Simpsons took a sharp downturn. I loved all the previous seasons. Every episode from season 1 through 9 are gold. Season 10 however is a huge disappointment. It's just not funny. It's not witty or clever at all. It's sad because The Simpsons was one of the best shows on television and will always be one of my favorite shows of all time (1-9 of course). The writing is just not as good as it once was. Such a shame when a great show like this becomes so hollow.
2,Not that Funny,"Speaking as a die-hard Simpsons fan, this season just falls flat. It's like someone wrote a season of jokes and dialogueof what they THINK the Simpsons should sound like, but falls flat. The genius of the Simpsons has always been its ability to deliver the unexpected... even when you're expecting it. Here its just the opposite, the set-ups are obvious and the deliveries are clich√©d.Season 8 and 9 are MUCH better. I've watched them with my kids several times and I'm still laughing out loud... But not with 10."
4,Why only available with a Bart head?,"I see that the Bart head is avilable for pre-order, but I hope they release a box for this season as well. That's why only the 4 stars. PLEASE Fox, don't make us fans go through all this, again like with season 6."
4,Very Good,i loved this season of the simpsons its better than the other seasons but i'm still waiting for the forthcoming seasons
3,Simpsons is losing its touch,"If you want my opinion, this season isn't as good as the prior seasons. Yes, there are some funny moments, but, overall, it's just so-so. The jokes are dated, and the writers have slipped from clever jokes to political jokes, which are not as funny. I bought it soley because I collect simpsons, but if you're looking for a funny season, try seasons 5, 8, and 9."
4,Still making me laugh....,"I stopped watching television around about 1996, so all the Simpsons I've watched since then has been on DVDs that I buy, and yes I have been buying each season as it comes out. Season 10 was no exception, but I am only just now getting around to a serious rewatching of this season, having glossed over it when it first came out on DVD. The first episode is classic Simpsons, with the key moment actually being when Lisa and her friends go shopping at ""Donner's Party Supplies"", and the sign on the window reading ""Winter Madness Sale"". This is a great joke, and literally a blink and you'll miss it moment. That the Simpsons writers are still trying this hard and jamming so many many micro-jokes into each episode is pretty awesome..:-)"
2,"""Hey Buddy, How About Inventing Yourself a Pair of Pants?""","That line is from one of the few really enjoyable episodes in this set (""Wizard of Evergreen Terrace""), predictably by John Schwartzwelder, but even he seems to be phoning it in by midway through this season (""Homer to the Max""). If season nine was the first year where the number of lazy episodes actually rivaled the quality ones, this is the first season where you could argue about the existence of *any* classics. At least last year you could point to Homer's handgun adventure, Ralph Wiggum's big break, or Homer and Marge's kinky getaway. This year you can point to the exact moment where celebrity guest voices started writing the episodes (""When You Dish Upon a Star""), and Homer taking up virtually any new profession was a sufficient story idea."
1,"great cyclopedia, bad purchase","Hello! This cyclopedia is great but I am disappointed with the purchase, the book has broken the binding, this should not happen when you acquire a new copy, insead of a used one...."
3,A reader from Colorado,This book is execellant for pictures. For information about growing and other details there is little.
2,Seemed Like a Very Long Read,"Hi all. I have been reading this for months and it isn't getting any more interesting as it progresses. A big train buff, I usually enjoy this type of book. Unfortunately this one just seems like a very boring history book to me. Like my favorite train book, The Wreck of the Penn Central, this one moves through the personalities of those who shaped the industry and then overlays what is happening at specific points in time, giving the reader the essence of what is happening. It just doesn't read as enjoyably as the Penn Central book.I really want to finish the book but I truly doubt I ever get through it...."
5,The Rhino Treads Lightly,"Quammen is a delight to read. His writing is lively, clear, workmanlike (in the very best sense of the word), with that spring in the literary step that a writer has or doesn't have, but has to be born with -- and I speak both as a fellow writer and as a professional editor. There is no in-between: Quammen is a real writer. His work is always infused with delight and usually makes me laugh out loud at least once per essay. His books teach without being obnoxiously didactic. These essays are full of wonder, information, and delight, and they are a pleasure to read -- and it doesn't get better than that!"
3,Good Light Reading,"Having read ""Song of the Dodo"", I was slightly disappointed. This is a collections of columns originally written for ""Outside"" magazine. Quammen admits to writing many of them at the last minute before the Outside deadline, and sometimes this haste shows through. The short format doesn't allow him to do much more than scratch the surface of any one topic. But within the limitations of the format, the pieces are very readable, interesting and sometimes funny."
2,Disappointed.,"The song selection is great, the sonic quality is horrible. On several songs the horns are cut off and sound distorted. I love Bobby Darin, but this CD was extremely disappointing. The BD selections on Ultra Lounge V15 sound so much better."
5,Forget Sinatra!,"This must be the best CD I've ever bought. The music is simply captivating, and it makes a perfect listen anytime. It goes from very relaxed songs (though not lazy as the Lazy River song might suggest) to charming lyrics like ""Don't dream of anybody but me"" and quite amusing ouvres like Mack the Knife or Artificial Flowers. Maybe I exaggerate with the Sinatra comment above, but if you ever want to get romantic about a girl, this is the music for it. I just can't get tired of listening this CD once and again; its music suits every possible mood (Try ""Black Coffee"" or ""What a difference a day makes..."")"
4,A Great Selection!,"This is a great compilation of Bobby Darin's songs and it makes for really good listening. I do have to agree with another listener though, that the mixing is sloppy on a couple of tracks, especially Mack the Knife. The crescendo tops out at the end and distorts. But I'm picky, and someone else might not notice this, so I recommend this cd as being one of the better ones out there."
5,No-one swaggered like Bobby Darin,"Sinatra is my favourite singer in the big band/swing genre that Bobby Darin covers on this CD but even he didn't exude the confidence that Darin could. Some of the songs on this CD are simply all-time classics - Mack The Knife, Beyond The Sea - and I also enjoyed the fun Clementine. This is music that bounces out of the stereo and makes you smile."
3,"It has his swingers, but too many ballads, which Darrin","Daris was many things a 50's rock'n'roller teeny bopper, a rockon' cowboy, and a vegas swingin' lounger, but he COULD NOT sing ballads. He just doesn't do well with songs like Black Coffee, when he sings a 3 minute ballad it seems like 10 minutes of terror. This cd does however have his greatest swinger son one cd Artificial Flowers, Beyond The Sea, and Mack The Knife, with a few midtempos taht he handles well by rockin' and rollin' hsi way thru swing standards liek Bill Bailey, Down With Love and Clemintine. A good cd, if only there were no ballads and all swingers! Still a good disc!"
4,Need,I needed a good vitamin for my eyes and my eye doctor recommended this vitamin. I can't say it is helping but if she said I needed it I am sure it is very helpful. I will continue to take it .
5,21st Century Lutein,The eye doctor recommended that I add Lutein to my multivitamins and minerals for my eyes. And the 21st Century is a good brand. Thank you for the quality product.
1,Boring,"This book has over 300 pages.....to bad only 97 of them hold the entire information portion of the book. There is a few pages in the back dedicated to a lumberjack's dictionary. The rest of the pages are pictures, index and glossary. You could probably find those or better pictures online if you tried. Overall I feel that this book was a waste of money and of time."
2,"He can play, anyway","""Cool""? You mean like Fonzie in ""Happy Days""? Or like Chuckles the Clown in the old MTM show? Virtuoso violinists are coming out of the woodwork these days. So why tolerate a conceited idiot? Heifetz was conceited and he was a virtuoso and he doesn't ""bore me to tears."" I've heard Kennedy (where did he ever get a name like that!), he can play, but it's not worth the garbage that goes along with it. I gave him one star because as long as I don't have to look at him, he can play well enough. They all can."
5,excellent spoons,i already owned a set of these measuring spoons and loved them so much I had to have a spare set. Ingredients do not stick inside of the spoons and they are easy to clean. They BALANCE on a counter. That's soooo awesome.
4,measuring spoons,like these - good and sturdyclean up much better than plastic spoons. accurate measures. Would highly recommend to everyone
1,Amco Advance measuring Spoons,I ordered these spoons because they were rated very well. After the first time using and washing the spoons they were left with a spot that was corroded. It's too much of a hassel to return so I accepted a 20% refund from the seller. I wouldn't buy these again.
5,"Love these spoons, sturdy and practical",These are great all purpose spoons. not flimsy at all.If you don't like plastic and rubber these are for you. solid and earthy.
5,Great measuring spoons sit nicely on the counter,These are really well made. I think the quality is beyond my expectations.The design is well thought out. I like that they sit flat since sometimes I like to load up spices and set them on the counter so they are ready when I need them.
5,Perfect,"This item arrived perfect on time and works really great, amazing product, it is an exccellent product and i catch a lot of fish,"
3,Disappointed...,"I bought this adapter to boot FreeNAS on an old HP PC. I could not get this to work which I assume is due to the BIOS of this 7 year old machine. However, from the web site I assumed I would be able to make this happen. Perhaps I will be able to blow the dust from the box and use it in another project at some point in the future."
4,Magical music.,"I think I'm in the minority of people who like ""Stevie Nicks"" just a little more than ""Fleetwood Mac"". Maybe because I grew up in the 80's. Anyway, this is a great collection, and off the top of my head I can't think of any of her solo songs missing. This includes ""Talk To Me"", ""Rooms On Fire"", ""If Anyone Falls"", and ""Edge Of Seventeen"". Plus it has ""Stop Draggin' My Heart Around"" with ""Tom Petty"", and ""Leather And Lace"" with ""Don Henley"", two of the best duets I've ever heard. Another moving song is ""Has Anyone Ever Written Anything For You"", which makes my wife cry every time. Overall it's 14 wonderful tracks that sound as good as she looked."
5,The Best Ever?,Stevie Nicks as a singer/songwriter is probably peerless among women. Her unique voice and writing talents are showcased on this wonderful greatest hits album.
5,Stevie is one of the best female singers ever!!!!,"""Timespace"" is positively beautiful!!!! It includes all her duets and some new songs previously unheard. ""Beauty and the Beast"" is gorgeous and ""Desert Angel"" is sad. I remember dancing to ""I Can't Wait"" as a teenager, and I still catch myself dancing today!!!!"
4,Good but made me mad!,"Stevie Nicks did not include all of her hits on this album. Nightbird, After the Glitter and Whenever I Call You Friend have been replaced by some God-awful tracks, Desert Angel, Loves a Hard Game to Play, and Sometimes its a bitch. Plus, Whole Lotta Trouble does not belong on this album at all and could have easily been replaced with the song Enchanted, Kind of Woman, Outside the Rain, Sleeping Angel or the Wild Heart.When playing a greatest hits album, one should not have to skip past songs. They should all be good. UGGGG!!!!!!!"
4,A complete set of greats!!,"This a fantastic compilation of Nicks' best work. As always, with any greatest hits package, your favorites are left out, and the ""sales figures"" favorites are relished upon. However, this is a great mix of work from Stevie's post-Fleetwood Mac periods.Her new tracks, ""Sometimes It's A Bitch"", and ""Desert Angel"" are...okay. Together, they average out to about a C. For example, I give ""Sometimes It's A Bitch"", an A, and ""Desert Angel"" an F, and an F plus a C is...? Yes, it's a C.This is, all in all, a great collection and what first introduced me to Stvie Nicks. I highly recommend this."
3,Good - But Not A True Representation of Her Work,"""Timespace"" is a solid collection of Stevie's hits from Bella Donna thru ""The Other Side of the Mirror,"" but it omits some of the lesser-known album cuts that are superior to many of the songs here. Stevie is always at her best (at least in her solo work) when she plays the role of wronged lover and she is out to even the score. ""Stop Dragging My Heart Around"" and ""Edge of Seventeen"" are the best songs of this caliber but she misses the mark badly with the meandering ""Whole Lotta Trouble."" The remixed ""Stand Back"" is'nt as effective as the original and the over-produced ""I Can't Wait"" sounds like a dentist's drill gone mad. The hits ""Talk to Me"" and ""If Anyone Falls"" sound great but have'nt held up as well as one might expect. I recommend the ""Enchanted"" boxed set over this one: it is costlier but gives more variety and includes some excellent obscure tracks."
4,Totally 80's,"Stevie Nicks' solo work differs greatly from Fleetwood Mac. Like everybody else, I prefer Fleetwood, but her solo stuff is exceptional as well. First off, OK--we know a lot of it sounds like the 1980's, but that's acceptable now. On her own, Stevie crafts her great, raspy voice into a Janis Joplin-esque rock singer. Greats like Stand Back and the inimitable Edge of Seventeen attest to this. There are also great ballads like Leather & Lace and Beauty & The Beast. I enjoy pretty much every song on the album and I reccomend it."
4,Stevie's Best Compilation To Date,"This is Stevie's best compilation to date, though it's a bit frustrating that a few smaller hits are missing (""After the Glitter Fades,"" ""Nightbird,"" ""Needles & Pins""). Alas, these songs were not included in the updated ""Crystal Visions"" compilation, either. Still, this CD does contain all of her biggest solo hits and is still the Stevie compilation to buy (the newer compilation, ""Crystal Visions,"" is a waste of money due to the inclusion of live songs and/or remixes instead of hits). So, until a truly definitive compilation comes along, this is still the one to buy. Note: most of Stevie's solo albums are worth picking up, too, especially ""Bella Donna"" and ""The Wild Heart."""
5,a very good CD,"This CD is filled with great classic songs from the Queen of Rock and Roll of the late 70's and early 80s. Stevie Nicks has always had a sexy voice. I love her duets on this CD with Tom Petty and Don Henley which are Stop Dragging My Heart Around and Leather and Lace respectively. I wonder why Stevie's duet with Kenny Loggins Whenever I Call you Friend is not included here. Most of Stevie's hits are included here like Stand Back, I Can't Wait, and If Anyone Falls. Timespace brings back a lot of memories from my preteen and teenage years. I enjoyed it very much."
2,poor description,"I would rate the condition as poor, not as described. The CD case was broken in several places and scratched."
2,It would be great...if it fit!,"This hitch was supposed to fit on my 2009 Sienna, but it didn't.I'm not sure if it was made wrong or was dropped really hard during shipping, but the bolt holes DID NOT LINE UP WITH THE FRAME OF THE VAN!!!This is a serious problem because it makes it impossible to install!Another reviewer had the same problem and he solved it by enlarging the bolt holes on the hitch.I followed his lead and used a Dremel tool w/ grindstone to elongate each hole about 3/16"" on the outside.Doesn't sound like much, but once done it went right on.In summary - the hitch is inexpensive and doesn't stick out at all once installed. But plan on doing some work to get it on your van!"
3,Does not fit!,"This hitch came quiclky, but tghe pacakaging was very poor. IT was a tight fit, however the holes did not line up so I was forced to elongate the holes on one side to allow me to install.I would have sent it back, but I did not want to go through the hassle.The price was very good!!!!JT"
5,Bolts right in to my 2008 Sienna,"Good quality and fit, low profile too. You may want to look into an airlift suspension upgrade to keep from dragging on driveways."
3,"It works fine, but it will touch the ground","It works fine, but it will touch the ground if the car goes thru a bump or something in that nature."
2,Received without packaging,"The product arrived without any package, just with the shipping label taped to the outside. I've posted a picture of how I received it. No wonder the paint is chipped off the corners. I give 2 stars for Amazon return service."
5,calming effect,"Our female dogs suffer from separation anxiety when we try to leave them to go out to dinner when traveling. Because of the barking and whining that they could possibly make and fear of pissing off the tenants in the ajoining rooms we end up just eating in our room to keep them calm. They howl or bark like crazy. To aleviate the problem my husband stays with them and I go down to the restaurant to pick up the food and we just eat in our hotel room. With this product we were able to give it to them within 1 hour to going out and they remained calm and quiet. We left the hotel room and the girls just sat their on the bed. They were not groggy or sleepy just peaceful and calm. they did not even bark when someone walked passed the room window. I don't use it often but when I do, it is so nice to know we can leave them and they remain calm and don't freak out."
2,Not for puppies!,"We purchased this as a preventative measure for when we picked up a new puppy. Unfortunately, when we got it, the bottle said that it was not for puppies. This should have been in the advertisement - and now it is. Don't know if will work or not, but I wouldn't have bought it if I had this knowledge."
5,RC Capicator,Works very would recommend for anyone with high drain digital servo. Smooth out the glitches cause by high speed or high power drain servos.
5,Saved my Spektrum and Havoc Pro from shutdowns,I have a spektrum sr3000 and Novak Havoc Pro (original) would have shutdowns occasionally during throttle use. I added this cap to my receiver and the issues went away. Has not failed in a race since.
1,Twin-Size? Nope.,"This futon frame requires a full-sized mattress, even though it is advertised as twin-sized. There is an extra foot of space when I put my twin-sized mattress on the frame. Also, the picture does not show that there is a large black support along the underside of the front beam; when the futon is arranged as a couch, this support is visible and unsightly."
5,Amortization book,This amortization guide book is great. I have used this book a lot and found it to be very valuable when contemplating a new real estate loan or refinancing.
1,Softcore Horror Porn,"Absoulte waste of time. No redeeming quality whatsoever, bad acting, bad editing, sofcore porn used early into the film and often in a poor attampt to stimulate interest. The viewer would have to be brain dead for any of the films contant to be interesting. I wish I could give it ZERO stars."
1,"Bad, really bad.",I can't think of anything positive to say. It had a home movie quality. The acting was poor. The feeling of a group of high school kids who decided to make a movie.
1,Let's Look at Reality,"So I guess the bottom line is, if you are underage you get one free murder. referring to Jacob as a ""child"" is stupid. He was a young adult, adolescent at the time of his crime. How convenient that all this abuse surfaces when there is no coorborating testimony.lots of kids are abused,not many actually resort to murder. The fact that he would even consider murder is revealing.Look to other cases where juveniles commit murder, are incarcerated until they are 21 and let go. Usually they are in trouble with the law or become violent with others. If you are capable of murder at 15, what can you do at 21? Society needs to be protected from these people.It's shocking that there is no consideration given the parents.Let's all feel sorry for the murderer! This is a tragedy for sure but to give this guy a ""get out of jail free"" card solves nothing and puts society at large. Whatever happened to common sense?"
3,"Very good, but now outdated!","The 'Visual QuickStart Guides'(VQG) from peachpit press are my favorites when it comes to quickly catch up on basics of a new software (version). In most cases I know of, the VQGs are frequently updagted when new versions of a program become available. Unfortunately, this particular book has not been updated since it's initial publishing in 1998.HotDog Pro is now in version 7, this book however deals only with Verion 4."
1,Broken within a couple of weeks,"Didn't expect a lot of power, but this hardly threw snow 5 feet. I got more power out of my Murray bikes I rode when I was a kid.I quickly got used to avoiding the power cord, but after three uses, it slowed down and eventually stopped working altogether. I took it apart a bit, but I couldn't figure out what was wrong besides a damaged motor. There is a 30-day ""Normal Wear Parts"" Guarantee, so I'll have to check that out.UPDATE: Had to have the electric motor replaced, luckily under warranty, because the repair was more than the original price I paid. It took about 10 weeks to get it repaired, which even in New England was longer than was left in winter. So I placed it in my garage to await for the summer tag sale season."
3,Great product may suffer in shipping,"My toddler is hooked on these and they are lower in sodium than Goldfish or the other cheddar munchies. However, when we have ordered in bulk on Amazon, I have noticed that each box's contents have a high % of broken pieces and crumbs. Same great taste, but hard to tell they are Duckies!"
1,Formula changed--these are AWFUL!,"I tried the single-serving koala krackers, also sold on Amazon, and they were excellent. So it seemed reasonable to buy this case of what is supposed to be the same thing except six servings per box rather than one. WRONG! The ingredients are not the same as the individual-serving packages. These have safflower oil, whereas the single-serving packs use butter. The taste is completely different. Now I'm stuck with a whole case of these nasty things. I guess I'll take them to the Food Bank as a donation. I feel ripped off."
5,Wow,"This is a great album from a great sax player. Lots of play allready on the internet. You can get it at Morpheusmusic.com orvisit his website at www.georgeshelby.com. I just love Two smiles from home, and Those Eyes. If your from LA you probably already know about this great guy and his music, now its time for the rest of the world to find out about himIn Sax heaven....."
3,For Researchers Only,"If you are interested in communication research, this is a good resource. It covers social science, theory, statistical methods and data analysis. However, if you're just interested in mass communication--especially as a writer--you might find this book a littel dry."
1,No science worth its salt,"I am middle school science teacher at a christian school (as well as a past public school teacher) and bought this in hopes of showing my class when we were discussing creation vs evolution. The video was just hokey. It presented very little evidence about creation or evolution, and the characters were silly. I hoped for some interesting evidence to support creation, all I got was a yawner of a soap opera. Needless to say I wasted my money as I didnt bother to show it to my class."
5,Still Haven't Cooked with It...,This is a nice pot. I saw Jacques Pepin cooking with one and it was such a beautiful red color and the soup he was preparing looked great. The pot is supposed to be microwave & stove top safe.
2,Frustrating for a one year old.,My daughter received this for her 1st birthday and she was very frustrated that she could not operate this on her own. She really was not patient enough to let me operate the Leappad while she watched. She is now 16 months old and it still makes her frustrated that she can't operate it. I find that it is a lot easier to read to her. I love the concept and we keep coming back to it to see if it will work out but it has not yet!
3,Disappointed,"I love the idea of this learning system. But it definitely needs some improvement. My son is not at all interested in it. The age range is definitely off. I will sit with my son and read to him, and he likes the music. He is not interested in the buttons and games. I wish it worked out better, b/c it has a lot of potential. My son is only a year now, hopefully he will show more interest in it in the future."
5,Little fingers,"have fun with LittleTouch LeapPad. My grandaughter loves to turn the pages of the books and listen to the sounds made as she presses the images. The different settings have grown ""up"" with her. I especially like the ability to turn spanish letters etc off and on, what a great intro to a second language.I look forward to helping her learn with My First LeapPad. Give your little loved one a jump start on learning."
2,On its way back,"We just purchased this item for our 19 month old daughter. She loves the pictures and music, but I agree with other reviewers that the concept of pressing HARD on the go button and pictures is frustrating for her. Also, the go buttons on the right side of our keypad are not functioning all of the time. This is on its way back to the store!"
1,Not interested...not fun for my twins,"We recieved this for our twins as a gift when they were about 6 months old. Manufacturers say it is suitable for 6months-3 years. Well, they had no interest in it at 6 months, and now at 19 months they still don't seem to get the concept of it. Both my girls LOVE books, and will spend a lot of time sitting quietly reading. I would not say that my girls are BEHIND developmentally at all, I would say this leap pad is WAY off on the recommended age. My husband and I are both willing to sit with them to work on this, but they just don't seem to care about it. It is not fun for them at at all. Guess we will just stick to the regular old books around here!Im getting ready to sell it on ebay now!"
2,Not really for Babies 6 months....,"I bought this for my 10 month old for Chistmas and it does not keep her attention even at 16 months old now!This might be better for her when she is closer to 2 years old. It is too complicated for her and has too many functions for someone so small.I recommend My First Story Reader insead. Perfect for small little ones. Easy functions and they get to press the buttons. Plus the books I feel are better, stronger made and more fun titles for little ones. Also, the price is reasonably less expensive compared to the Little Touch.The First Story Reader has a set of three books for the cost of one of the leap pad books..."
2,Age range is a little off,"Received this as a gift for our 18 month old, and it really doesn't hold her interest at all (even if I sit down and try to read it to her). All she wants to do is rip the book off the holder and try to ""read it herself"".I will say that the pages are durable, and do not tear. I think the book is a little too advanced for the age groups listed. Possibly 2 or 2.5 yr olds would have a better attention span, and the knowledge to push the graphics to get the audio feedback from the book.One other thing is that every time you turn the page, you have to ""push"" the a green button on the page, so the pad knows what page you are on - I don't know how good any child under the age of 3 would be with this - so most reading would have to be ""with an adult"" - otherwise - the child just does not get anything out of the book.I personally like the pad (and it's books) and hope that in time, our daughter will get more out of it. Will write an update if she does show interest."
3,not infant/toddler friendly,the buttons arent very easy for a young child to press. maybe my 14 month old will enjoy it when older.
3,its ok,"This product is great if your child never plays with the books. As soon as they get ahold of them & start to crinkle the pages, the machine can no longer tell what page it's reading. My daughter likes me reading the books to her & the machines sits in the closet. The books are great & what they say is true about them. They dont tear & are ok for teathing babies."
3,I Have a Love/Hate Relationship with this toy,"First of all, to use this properly you must use this toy with your child. I see that as a pro.With that said, I don't see how it can be useful before age 1. From ages 1 to 2 the kids are annoyed that they cannot do it themselves. By age 2 or 2 and 1/2 they can do it themselves. But, by then, wouldn't it be easier to just read to them instead of being locked into overpriced leapster book purchases? This was a gift but I would not have bought it on my own."
3,Isn't really for 6 month olds!,We got this as a gift for our dd at christams time when she was 5 months. Although it says its for babies age 6 months in my opinion it isnt really. All she has ever wanted to do with it is try to eat the pages. And press buttons but getting her to acctually sit down while you help her read it hasn't happened yet and she is 15 months old now. I tihnk evetually it will be a great toy but I dont expect that to happen until she maybe 18 months or more. So maybe holding off on this one might be a good idea espcially if your baby/toddler is always on the go and to busy to stop ttp read like mine.
3,A little disapointed.,"I bought this toy for my 10 month old, she was not as interested as I thought she would be. I was disapointed in the books, I thought the pages should have been plastic instead of paper. I would probably not recommend this toy."
3,Great in concept...,"But I think it was designed for older kids. My daughter got this when she was 8 months from my grandmother and she had more thrill in ripping the pages of the books than actually playing with it. It's too hard for little hands to push the pages hard enough to get any use, so if a parent sits with the baby and does it it may hold the concentration longer. For the most part, I put it away until she gets older. I think after she hits 2 or 3 she'll appreciate it a lot more."
1,KEEP SHOPPING,"TOO HARD FOR KIDS TO UNDERSTAND, JUST NOT VERY DURABLE, NOT WORTH THE MONEY. I FEEL MY CHILD IS RATHER SMART FOR TWO, JUST NOT EASY FOR A CHILD TO UNDERSTAND, EVEN WITH ADULT HELP."
3,doesn't hold baby's interest,"I got this for my 14 month old daughter so that she would have something to play with while her 4 year old brother was playing with his My First Leappad (they always want the same toy at the same time, no matter what age it's intended for). Unfortunately, the First Touch Leappad doesn't interest her the way her brother's Leappad does; I even tried some different books (the one with the photos of animals seems best of the ones we tried, while my 4-yr. old likes the Little Engine one). Maybe she'll grow into it, as other reviewers have suggested. On the plus side, the pages are much sturdier than they seemed at first.Also, I've discovered that the backpack for the My First Leappad will fit the books and cartridges for the Little Touch Leappad, and makes for much handier storage than those big plastic ""sleeves"", so I'm going to order a backpack for my daughter now."
5,Great Book,I have had the great opporunity to hear Fr. Benedict Groeschel speak on several occasions. Each time had been a great learning experience. I have read several of Fr. Groeschel's book and he knows how to say things in simple terms - terms that the average person can understand. This book would make a good present for anyone. By reading this book you get an insight into several of the greatest religion thinkers and writers ever. I would recommend this book to anyone.
4,solid overview,"comprehensive and powerful grooves that keep the feet dancing endlessly. Could have used some harder core stuff, as well; but this does quite nicely."
1,Avoid,I bought this for the Shostakovich. I now regret the decision. Very poor playing and unacceptable SQ made this a very poor purchase.
3,"Old ""Zoom"" card ?","I had bought about 3 years ago, maybe more, a Zoom card. Then my laptop fell on the card and both broke. Got the same laptop (7 y.o. laptops are cheap :-) and wanted the same card. Zoom no longer available, but this one looks pretty much the same, maybe they sold the product line (Zoom was a U.S. based company). Can't tell if it's better or worse than the zoom card, since I upgraded the Toshiba stack. Did have some limited functionality with the old install of the stack, but I decided to do clean install. (as much as it is possible).May edit this reveiw in a couple of days, since I will be installing fresh on Win 7."
2,Attention Global 9 teachers (NY),"This video may be fine for personal use, but our school purchased it with the intent of using it with our 9th graders as part of their social studies curriculum. With that purpose in mind, I was disappointed upon viewing the tape. Although the voiceover and regional footage are useful, the many segments featuring the college professors are too esoteric--the vocabulary they use is well beyond any 9th grader's comprehension, and is frustrating for even a teacher to sit through! What captured my attention in purchasing this video was the overview of each religion and promise of period and region-related imagery. These are provided; however, I wanted to warn other teachers comtemplating this purchase that, in my opinion, it is a waste of money in terms of a junior high/high school level."
5,A very useful video for teaching World History.,"I teach 10th grade World History and I find this a very useful video in introducing the world religions. I do not expect the video to do my teaching for me. I introduce the basic ideas in the historical context, and have the kids start reading the basic info in the textbook and THEN I show the relevant 10 minutes of the video. What I like is the objective stance of the film, the emphasis on the connection and differences between related religions and how religions change over time. The visuals and the brevity of the segments are a great assistance.This is a very useful teaching tool! I use it every year."
3,Thin book,"Nice pictures and easy reading, but the book is a thin paperback; I was expecting something with a bit more heft to it."
2,"Cheap way, but disappointing to get two films.","I mainly bought this for ""Chairman of the Board"" and figured well I'll get another movie for a great price. I was also expecting widescreen transfers and extras, but beyond the two movies, the was nothing on this disc. Nothing. Not even widescreen transfers. This was disappointing and disheartening, but the two movies at least look good for full screen transfers and sound okay, but other than that, buy the DVD's separately."
1,IF I COULD GIVE IT 0 STARS I WOULD,"This game is horrible, if i could return this game i would. It is not worth spending even a penny on. Confusing and boring!"
1,Too hard for the normals,This game was too hard to learn. It took me 30 minutes just to figure out how to build a building and it took me 15 minutes after that to figure out what i did. dont listen to what anyone else tells you. dont buy. big waste.
4,Pros and Cons of Fast Food Tycoon 2,"Fast Food Tycoon 2 is more like ""The Sims"" than the other tycoon games I've played, so if you like The Sims, you'll probably like Fast Food Tycoon 2. You have to build up your pizza empire and outdo your opponent. I think the label in the genre is ""comic mischief."" The major drawback to this game is the total lack of documentation. However, there is a good discussion board ... If you get stuck and post a help message to the discussion board, other players can generally help you out. Also the name in the U.S. is deceptive, as other reviewers have mentioned. I understand that outside of the U.S. it is called ""Pizza Connection 2,"" which is a more accurate description. Pizza is your only choice of wares. Overall, though, I really enjoy the game. At first I was mad because I wanted to sell burgers too. Now I'm okay with the pizza thing."
4,Better than the first one,"This game was alot of fun. As the player, you have alot more control over the game than you did the first one. And the limit for how many people you could employ per restaurant is now gone. The graphics were more realistic. All in all, it is a much better version. Definatly worth the money. Alot of replay value."
3,Not What I'd Hoped,"I always thought a ""restaurant sim"" would be fascinating - preparing the menu, choosing the decor, hiring employees, expanding, etc. Fast Food Tycoon seemed to offer some semblance of that, but not with the depth I hoped for. It would be nice to be able to branch out beyond pizza - though the choices of toppings are somewhat inspired. The game game with few instructions other than a tutorial that you can play upon starting the game, and even that wasn't all that intuitive to figure out. I guess this game would be a good diversion for a while. I haven't tried the rest of the ""tycoon"" games, but I hope some of them are better than this."
3,Good Movie,Not as good as the book this is based off of but I did cry at Forest Whitaker's performance. Amazing.
3,Interesting movie,"The main reason I give this 3 stars is because the DVD I purchased would freeze up on certain scenes and froze up entirely towards the end of the movie. The vendor was notified and quickly issued a refund. However, of what I did see of this film, it is engrossing and well acted."
2,Slow movie,The story is one of those ones that you think will get better but never does. The concept was ok but the story just moved in the wrong direction and never really go going.
1,poor quality of paste,"I am 67 years old and have hung a lot of wallpaper in my day. The quality of paste on this product is extremely poor. I removed the old border because after 6 years it was beginning to tear and roll at the edges. This new product rolls before I get it on and no amtter how much paste I add, still rolls at the edges. I am very disappointed."
5,On second thought...,"A reader from Bend, Oregon On second thought, after looking more closely at Grossman's work, I see what a marvelous and spectacular book it is. I will recommend it to all my friends as a fantastic source on the Persian Gulf War."
2,Fact or Fiction ?,This book reads great like a fictional novel. Why ? Its sources are contradicted by many other books on the subject.
2,Below average on every level,"This series starts okay, but then continuously goes downhill, to the point where it makes you wish, by the end, you had the hours back that you'd wasted watching it. The last disk in the series is particularly bad, completely nonsensical and unsatisfying. It made me wonder if the producers were playing some sort of joke on the people who'd been suckered into watching that far. Perhaps they just couldn't figure a way to end the story. In any event, you have been warned, so my conscience is clear (except to add that parts of this series will seriously offend some viewers). Not recommended."
4,Very lightweight and unique,"I like these. They are very lightweight and unique. With the double wall you can't feel the temperature of the drink, and the glass doesn't ""sweat""."
3,Picture Justice,"It seems to me that the picture of the cups does them a lot more justice. Once I received the cups, the novelty wore off. They feel like cheap plastic and even tapping the glass sounds like i'm tapping a plastic cup. My wife complained that the glasses are too wide for her small hands. I would not repurchase given the option. Some of the glasses seem to sweat (build up condensation) on the inside. This gives the appearance that the cup is not dry and looks dirty. There is no way to get the water out from the inside. It'll stay like that for a very long time. I guess the only way to remove it is using the heat dry option in a dishwasher, I have not tried it."
5,Luigi Bormioli Duo beverage glasses,"Love these glasses! Light weight, durable, and they don't sweat. Plus they look nice on the table. Everyone who uses them at our house wants to know where to get them!"
1,Watch out for lead in paint. . . made in China!,I've seen this at Tuesday Morning I think for less and in other forms for other teams. I wouldn't buy it then nor now. No need for risk of lead paint. $13 is about $8 too much anyway. In my opinion. :)
4,"Cute, fun gift","This was a gag-gift for a friend at work who's a Rams fan, I couldn't resist.He did find it amusing. The music box plays a tune when you wind up the little horned rascal (Rams, remember?)The music box plays ""Twinkle, Twinkle little star"" or at least a close derivative thereof. Considering how the Rams are playing this year ""When You Wish Upon a Star..."" might have been more appropriate...Recommend this mostly as a gag/fun gift, not something to really give a child, not sure if I trust the paint on this since it's made in China, although I did research and there are no recalls on the product. Still better safe than sorry...Recommend for age groups that would not try to teethe on this product..."
4,Wonderful debut,"I thought that Men at Large made a strong first album back in 1992. It came at a good time too, since they were one of three R&B artists Gerald Levert produced that year (Gerald himself included) that had hits. But these big guys have some powerful singing voices! They were like the Ruben Studdards of back then in terms of strong singing talent. I still love So Alone, which sounded so good in the cold nights of winter 1992/93. They've got some funky numbers on here where they just party it up. But why they weren't given a stronger push on East West/Atlantic Records in the '90s is beyond me. They were one of the underrated R&B artists at the time, and I want to give their respect due with this review."
5,The Anatomy of a Hall of Fame Career,"Jack Buck was a splendid announcer, whose warm and friendly demeanor became his trademark. This was a truly humble man who cared about people; but he also wasn't afraid to confront those who were self-absorbed or shallow. His biography is a fascinating story of his humble beginnings, his slow rise to broadcasting prominence, and his remarkable ascension to the top of the mountain; very few have attained such greatness in his profession. It's no wonder he was such a revered part of Cardinal baseball folklore, and it's no wonder he's enshrined in the broadcaster's wing at Cooperstown.This story, in essence, is a wonderful anatomy of a Hall of Fame career; it's definitely a winner."
4,"I would like to give 3.5. Good stories and thoughts, but...","I would like to give 3.5 stars. Good stories and thoughts, but...seems a bit ""all over the place"". But, reading this bookis definitely a pleasure."
1,Hadn't used it for awhile ... and it died immediately.,"My Zip 250 USB sat in a drawer, unused, for about four years. Plugged it in today, and got the Click Of Death. Thanks, Iomega! It was brilliant of you to design a gizmo that has NO MANUAL EJECT. Drive dies, disc is stuck, and there's no way to pop it out. Argh."
2,returned it,"The zip drive didn't give any more than i already have with my 100 MB zip drive in fact it only would give me 96 MB. I was hoping to get 250 MB,"
1,"Warning!!!! Slow, expensive, miserable service from Iomega","All you need to know is that this drive is expensive, slow and that service and technical help when it goes wrong from Iomega is utterly miserable. Avoid this product unless you like spending hours on hold or you like your technical help from incoherent morons. Avoid this like the plague."
2,Iomega Zip 250 MB USB External Drive - Not a very good idea,"Would be very nice to have a back-up disk of 250mb anytime you wanned, but it is not as nice as sounds like. Not very many have this drive, what would make a lot harder to transport your saved files from one computer to another. Another thing is the fact that this drive is a USB External drive, what make the transference of the files very, very slow. I would not recomend this drive for anyone."
1,why would anyone buy a zip drive in 2011?,"anyone that even considers for a moment that they might want to spend money on a zip drive....well, lets put it this way: there is a 87% chance you are still paying for AOL. The very fact that a potential zip drive customer is reading this review is nothing short of spectacular. Your journey to this web page was probably epic in nature. It most likely involved help from 1-3 family members, using ""the google,"" and several hapless attempts at setting up an amazon username and password. this is probably news to you: you don't have to be at home to check your email. just let that soak in for a minute. I'll BE OVAR 9000"
2,A nightmare to use,"I bought this product after reading all the positive reviews. However, iomega has not done a sufficient job with the programming for the USB drive. You have to uninstall any and all previous USB devices on your computer to even get it to work. Zip 100 disks do not function half as well on the 250. You can't even full format the zip100 in the 250 drive. Customer support is so shoddy and not helpful at all. They take weeks to resond to your emails (if at all). And are impossible to deal with over the phone. Just look at the iomega.com customer support forum and you'll know what i mean. Avoid this product until they can iron out their USB problems. Avoid iomega because they don't take care of their customers!"
4,Caring for the wine AND the soil,"This is a great book for both, laymen and wine experts, on biodynamic winemaking. Nicolas Joly explains in a very simple way, why it is worth using all our senses at winemaking. Biodynamics respects nature's peculiarities in a positive sense and thus helps the vine to incorporate these specific characteristics into the wine. The origin of the so called ""denominacion d'origine controlee"". If all farmers, not only wine growers could respect their most cherrished input, the soil, as biodinamic wine growers do, what a wonderful world this would be! No more instransparent subsidies from States to the agribusinesses, no more hunger, and less diseases in the world.Bravo Nicolas! Welcome good wine, great wine."
2,wish I read other reviews before,"I wish I read the reviews talking about pseudo-science before. While it is true there is a lot of hocus-pocus there are also some good parts. I am sure the author means well but he probably does not have enough of a scientific background to discern what is valid in Steiner's methods and what is pure ""fertilizer"""
4,Freestyle at it's best!,This CD does take you back to the 80's with these dance club hits. Good CD to listen to while you're hanging out enjoying a good BBQ with Friends!
5,This is an awesome cd.,I have been a fan of freestyle music for years. I would definately recommend this cd to anyone who loves freestyle music. The cd has a good variety of artists that mix well throughout the whole album.
5,Great Old School Freestyle!,"This CD not only sounds great, but offers some hard to find selections that were even hard to find when the songs were released. Selections are from '83 to '91, and offer a nice mix of both New York and Miami Freestyle. If you're a fan of good Freestyle, then this is a must have for any collector."
1,who thought this one up???,"Easily the worst of the George books. The Man with the Yellow Hat takes George to an air show and lets George look around unsupervised (that man has to be the biggest bone-head on the planet, seeing as how George gets into trouble EVERY TIME he is left alone!). George climbs into the back seat of a little bi-plane and the pilot takes off, not knowing George is sitting back there. Once in the air, he notices George is there, and KNOWING THAT, decides to do a roll, dumping George out of the plane!!?!?! Luckily George just happened to be holding a parachute, which he manages to deploy before becoming a monkey splat. After previewing this book I decided not to read it to my 2-year-old, what a terrible story!"
2,Mediocre at best,"The graphics on this game are excellent as is the animation and movements.However the characters are extremely limited. In most contests I fought the generic computer char, and only fought 4 real characters in over an hour of playing.I like the concept of the game, and it could be more fun if it had more chars to fight, and more features. For example you earn money in the game, but the only purpose of the money is to travel to the next contest.It would have been nice if I could have bought new weapons, clothes, etc.Over all this is simply mediocre and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone other than those who can't afford better games."
1,WORST GAME EVER MADE,"IF YOU LOOK FORWARD TO A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME THEN BUY Kabuki Warriors.Kabuki Warriors bogged me out, I played it for 5min. then snapped it in half. I look farward to the day that Kabuki Warriors becomes illigal**********DO NOT BUY Kabuki Warriors YOU WILL BE SORRY***********I'LL SHOW YOU"
1,Bad bad bad,"Okay, Kabuki is a type of Japanese theater, but it's NOT ""based around a style of Asian theater where the actors used to actually hurt each other on stage"" - that would be (...) kids emulating WWF.This game is probably the single worst fighting game that has ever been released. It shouldn't have been released ANYWHERE. (...)(...)"
1,"Good title, terrible Game","I lost interest after the first game, i gave it the benefit of a doubt, and i was right about first impressions, the game is very outdated, and the graphics and performance features were below my expectations, reminded me of my atari days."
1,(...) WORST GAME EVER FOR ANY CONSOLE,"Man, this game is the worst game I had ever played. EVerything is wrong about this game. THe controls are aweful, TRhe graphics are outdated, the moves (...), the caractors look bad, the fighting is terrible. When I first rented this game because I am a avid game of fighting, after the first match, I returned it to blockbuster. I HAVE NEVER PLAYED SUCH A FAILURE!!(...). This game is abysmal. This game sholud have never been released because it is so(...) aweful. (...)"
1,Garbage!,"Every single thing about this game sucks! Without knowing what I was in for,I bought this at a local video store about five years ago for like eight bucks,and oh my god,I hated myself for planting down eight dollars for this complete waste.It's not even worth eight cents! I threw the game in the trash,because unfortunatly the damn video store would not refund my money,so I just tossed it right out.The game is terrible.The gameplay is god awful,the music and sounds suck and the characters are just a total joke. Hands down.Worst fighting game of all time.Even Shaq Fu isn't this bad.At least Shaq Fu has a ""so bad,it's good thing"" going for it. Kabuki Warriors is just bad period.Avoid this AT ALL COSTS!!!"
2,A whole lot of lying going on...,"First, I loved the concept and the game had some nice graphics (the textures and animations were really nice) It also was a really interesting concept (fighting game that isn't based on a bunch of guys and gals out to rule the world somehow by beating each other up). Unfortunately, the developers or producers were REALLY creative with the truth.First, there is nothing even close to 24 characters. There are 12 and there is no way to unlock more. If you hold down the trigger, you get to choose different colors of clothing.Second, the game states that each character has his or her own special power. Of the 12 characters, only 9 have special powers (one of those being invisibility that the computer can see through).Third, I beat the single player in about 20 minutes and didn't lose once.The only reason why I gave this game 2 stars was because it's cheap at Fry's ($$$) and I like kicking the heck out of my brother on it...."
2,"outdated, traditional corporate finance book","This book is outdated. The coverage was mostly corporate finance, not investment banking. In addition, I heard and confirmed that the materials covered in this book are close to 100 percent identical to another book by the same authors under slightly different title. A big disappointment."
4,Signature music from Maurice Jarre,"Recognizable orchestrations and the lilting, yet sinister, melodies that Jarre specialized in, are the trademarks of this score for William Wyler's engaging and effective film version of one of John Fowles most famous novels. The master music stems were used for this Mainstream CD edition, and it sounds particularly better than other soundtrack efforts from that distributor. A double harpsichord is a central element - adding the right romantic insidiousness to the score. As usual with Mainstream, they've added some unreleated film-music filler at the end of the score - more a mood killer than a necessity to lenghten the CD. Out of print, and generally hard to find at reasonable prices - but highly recommended."
5,EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I VERY TRULY LOVE IT BIG TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!VERY TRULY EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!VERY TRULY FUNNY BIG TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!VERY TRULY WELL MADE BIG TIME!!!!!!!!!!
3,Transfers need fine tuned.,"""Hazel"" was always a great show, but so far, all I've seen is episodes that look far from the ones I watched on TV. The color, as I clearly remember was the same quality as movie film. These episodes look ""washed"" out; they are too bright and a little distracting. I'm disappointed, because this was a beautiful show, full of excellent clarity and color.As far as the show itself: it presented clever story lines that made it a true classic."
5,Great,I'm so happy to be able to throw away my vas tapes and look at this classic show on DVD. My only hope now is that the final 2 seasons of the show will also be issued on DVD and soon!
3,Not the best video transfer,Season 1 was released by Sony. Season 2 and beyond are from Shout Factory. They do a good job and I appreciate that they take on releases that other companys don't consider worthwhile. The video transfer for season 2 isn't nearly as crisp as season 1 and it doesn't look like much was done with color correction. But its fun to watch and I'll take it for what it is.
5,a happy place,A happy place to visit. A feel good place to go. An innocent view of the world. Very uplifting. Wish i could live in Hazel's neighborhood!
5,MR.B,"glad to see hazel finally getting some respect. glad sony isnt involved with hazel anymore.if mr. b was my boss i would tell him off. he's very rude to hazel, she just wants to help him."
5,HAZEL Third Season looking great!,"Please allow me to add a few comments to the other reviews for Hazel Third Season. I am very pleased with the video and sound quality. There may have been a tad of a color saturation problem on the Season Two dvd release but it has been much improved for the Hazel Third Season dvd. And there are some very nice extras for Hazel's most loyal fans (like me) in the closing credits with a close up, front end shot of a 1964 Ford Fairlane used in the background and on one of the episodes we get a 1964 Ford Galaxie 500 rolling down the highway while the Hazel credits roll. It is really wonderful to see the closings as they were first broadcast in 1963-64. Thank you so much Shout for taking the time and care to add these special and meaningful touches. I am looking forward to the Hazel Fourth Season dvd. Does anyone know when Shout will release it?"
3,"Good, but uneven","This book does a good job as an extended discography of Zappa's work, but fails as a biography of his actual life, personal or professional. I enjoyed the detail that Courrier brought to Zappa's early life, especially the assembly of early albums from compositions and live recordings. But as Zappa got married and developed a family, it seems like his personal live was entirely minimized within the book. The PMRC trial hardly got a page of ink, although it was a large event in Zappa's life, and other events were quickly mentioned and then left behind. Meanwhile, each album had pages and pages of detail for each song. I did appreciate the play-by-play on the albums, especially the long appendix detailing the differences in the current CD releases from the original LPs, but I was hoping for more third-person detail about the man Zappa, aside from what was officially presented in his own book."
2,"Zappa is a god to Courrier, but not to me","Yes, the book does a decent job of covering the various phases of Zappa's career, but Courrier's admiration of Zappa colors the book and prevents it from being an even-handed view of his career. There's plenty to admire in what Zappa accomplished, but Courrier dismisses off-handedly legitimate criticisms of Zappa's role as bandleader, composer, purveyor of comedy music, panderer to the juvenile, and cultural icon that might have given the book balance. For Zappa maniacs only."
3,Take this book out of print,This program is so out of date that it won't run on any current machine. Take it off the list.
3,bootleg,"this is a BOOTLEG, but the vinyl sounds pretty OK even if it is most likely mastered from the CD release. The spontaneously improvised performances are excellent."
2,Photos unreadable,"Got this book on Kindle Fire and love the content. However the photos, which illustrate the text and are of great importance, are so small as to be unviewable. Tried different ways to blow them up to some reasonable size, all to no avail. Downloaded the book to a PC but the illustrations still stay stubbornly micro size. The rating of only 2 stars reflect this fact.Not having the photos, not only mars the pleasure of reading the book, but makes understanding the points the author makes difficult. Ramparts, city gates and other architectural elements cannot be visualized. Maps of settlement patterns cannot be discerned.Does anybody knows a way to see properly these illustrations? Did the author maybe place them on same shared photo site where they could be viewed. Without this I cannot recommend getting this book in the Kindle store."
2,condition of book,"The book itself was in decent enough condition for a used book, but the smell was very musty. Ordinarily never buy a used book if it has a noticeable odor. I put baking soda between the pages and let set for a couple of months, put it outside in the sun, etc. but most of the smell remains."
4,Catholic Social Teaching,"If your interested in Catholic Social Teaching and don't know where to begin, I'd say this wonderful encyclical by Pope John Paul II's is the place to start.Much is discussed in this small book, for example, in keeping with the vocation of the Vicar of Christ, he draws our attention to global problems by giving a broad outline of these difficulties. To these problems he presents basic theological arguments to the effect of a reminder of Christ's command ""love thy neighbor.""But what is most helpful about the book is the way he provides a framework for the goal of Catholic Social teaching. He proposes a few negative arguments for what it is not, as well as a few positive arguments to clarify what it does.For quite some time I've been curios about how to apply Catholic Social teaching as a layman and this book has helped me immensely with that curiosity."
4,bracket broke,"- Here is a nice link to compare the brightness of the Planetbike lights:[...]- The plastic mount for helmet was broken when I tried to tight it on my helmet...Good thing is they sell the replacement parts for $3: [...]. So, don't do the same mistake i made...- I mounted on the bike, it is definitely more than "" to be seen "" light. At the angle I mounted light comes to my eyes...you might consider to put an opaque tape to block the light or change the mounting angle- I didnt like the switch. It is a little bit too stiff and if you push it too hard you may break the bike mount.Make sure to counterbalance the downward force you are applying by holding the mount from the opposite side of the switch..Perhaps you shouldnt do this while biking."
4,"good product, just needs to be more water resistant","After getting my bike's light stolen a couple of times, I decided that getting a helmet-mounted light would ensure that no one would steal my light. This light is pretty effective and relatively cheap. Unfortunately, I left the helmet outside for a day, during which there must have been a light shower. Upon trying to use the light again, I found that it didn't work, and that some of the battery contacts were heavily discolored (like old, green copper). I tried scrubbing what parts I could reach with a q-tip, letting the light dry out, and using fresh batteries, but to no avail. Alas."
1,failed on first use,Looks good and works fine - once -The small on / off and selection switch failed with the first usage. It is far too fragile.
3,Head Mounts Light,"Handy Bicycle Light that can double as a cave exploring Light with Head Mounts. May cost cheaper than big name cave exploring Lights, although not as comfortable, powerful. Can also be used as a repairman's Light for under sinks, cars, or in dark sewer pipes. For Bike, it's better than nothing but not that bright."
3,What it ain't,"First off, what this light ain't. It ain't no 4 watt led light. It is a 4 led light. Big difference. It is just fine for what it is. If you are looking for a really strong led light, keep on shopping."
3,Not bedtime reading.,"Edgeworth wrote about the protestant upper class in Ireland around the turn of the 18th/19th century. At the time, especially in Rackrent, her most famous work, she wrote of the machinations of bad landlords and how their families died out. It is interesting that she was writing about the demise of these bad landlords, suggesting that things had improved in this more enlightened age, at a time when the Irish Peasant was worse off than ever. Edgeworth wrote of a society that was on the brink of extinction, but she was not aware of this, since she was part of that society. This book is noteworthy for what it is not. It is not Irish literature. It is poor british literature and would have no merit at all if it did not serve to contrast with the high quality scribblings of the uneducated and unwashed downtrodden masses. Like the protestant ruling class it is sparse, stilted and haughty. Not a fun read."
4,A most excellent work!,I love this book! Very thorough and gives lots of practice overall. There are only two things I wish it had: an answer key and more practice with the script (reading and writing).
1,learning yiddish,i did not realize the book was not in english i thought it was english/yiddish there was no where to find that out until i purchased the book. It should have been more informative so i would not have purchased the book
4,Advanced Practice Nursing Education,"As nursing textbooks go, this one is a keeper. The amount of information in this book is incredible, especially the Internet site information. The only thing preventing it from being a 5 star book is the overall presentation. The writing style is very dry and somewhat redundant. This is a required text for my graduate program so I have to read it but I'm keeping it for future reference."
3,Adequate purchase,"Product was received quickly. There was more writing and highlighting in the used text than I expected, but overall the book was in good condition."
2,not satisfied at all,"I was very disappinted with this book because I was expecting something spectacular, with great advice and tips. In reality, this is merely a book of lists, such as what is on a playgroud, what clothing kids wear, etc. If I just open my eyes, I can see these things for myself, and save the money on this over-priced book. Writing is about creativity, and Suben and Amoss say taking elements from a list will make better writers."
2,The lists don't work,"The idea of the lists is a good one, and a few of the lists in the front of the book worked for me. (This is probably what sold the publisher on the idea of a reference book.) But as the book continues, the lists become more and more inane to the point of insulting the reader. Toward the end of the book, the format morphs into a paragraph or so on a subject followed by a page of lists of such hard-to-know things as the colors of children's eyes and hair. Also since each word in the list is a dot floating in a sea of whitespace, some pages in the book don't have a 100 words on them. If they removed the lists and reduced the size and price of the book by half, it would probably be worth buying.I really get the impression that the authors lost their way on this list concept."
3,Used Book - But Not Much Else Available,"If you need a book to help with the older computer language of COBOL then this book is helpful. I doubt you will find this book ""NEW"". The one I purchased was in very good used condition and I knew what the contents would be as I had seen the book prior to purchase."
3,An Overlooked Gem!,"Big Bub's solo debut is one of the most underrated urban releases of 1992. At a time when the dominance of new jack swing started to escape the urban contemporary scene, Big Bub's incorporation of the outdated genre at its departure may have proven to be its biggest fallacy.Even with all of its deficiencies, Big Bub carefully balances the outdated genre with a smooth set of romantic tunes, which many consider to be the saving grace of the album. The highlights include the seductive ""Simon Sez"", the soothing ""Tellin' Me Stories"", and the romantic ""Work It Out"". Other noteworthy tracks are the funky ""I Don't Mind"", and ""24/7"".Commercially, the album bombed, mainly for an insignifcant lead single. Big Bub would correct this problem with his second time around and receive favorable reviews. However, this album is not needless filler. There is enough memorable tracks to merit a purchase. Therefore, this album is for new jack and smooth soul listeners."
5,r and b in its truest form!,"i bought this on cassette when it came out in the early 90's i felt so greatful to find the cd on amazon! even at 20 years old it's pricey but they say you get what you pay for this one is a classic! from beginning to end no filler! first side head bangin' i dont mind, touch me and hitting skinz!... fire! hip swingin' side put it on for your love session and be careful you might make a baby! LOL! but 24/7 is the masterpiece plus the smash tellin me stories, this far surpasses anything bub did with today and you know they went hardbody! all new jack swing fans will appreciate this one if only we could be blessed with real music like this now a days...treat yourself add this to your cart now!"
5,Miles of Wire Sets a new Course,"I learned of this band through KDHX's weekly Thursday show called ""Fishing with Dynamite"" hosted by St. Louis's own Fred Friction. This band rocks, it is passionate and absolutely confused and demented. The band is tight and pushes the edge of acceptable topics in music, but who can relate? Your mother is a domineering freak, your friends rob your chances and love and alcohol and access to big pharmacy takes your will? It is all here and highly recommended![...]"
1,VTech 9122,"I'm returning this phone after only one week. The static on the line and interference are horrible. The phone continually misreads phone numbers I input and the LCD indicates there is a ""message waiting"" when there are none. I was trying to get by buying a cheap phone--you get what you pay for."
2,"Some nice features, but poor sound quality","The 9122 is comfortable and has a nice feel, an easily navigatible keypad and a nice LCD screen, but the overall sound quality on the phone I got was terrible. All conversations exhibited a weird ""etherial"" lingering of the voice coming through the earpiece, and I heard the same thing as I spoke into the mic. It's hard to explain. It's not the voice echoing typical of 2.4GHz digital phones...more of a hissy lingering of words. People on the other end said I sounded fine, but what I was hearing on my end was really annoying. Incoming volume wasn't even as good as an old VTech 9211 I have. The one feature I DID like is when another phone on the same line is being used, ""Extension In Use"" is displayed on the LCD. But that certainly doesn't justify wasting money on this phone.I returned it and got a Panasonic KX-TC1703B with more features for the same price, and it's been fantastic."
1,NEVER AGAIN,"Joan Hohl must be the unhappiest person alive........nothing but anger and hatred coming from her pen. This is my first of her books and, needless to say,will be the last. I like to read for enjoyment. How can two people who obviouslyhate each other expect to marry and have a good relationship? THIS BOOK ISPURE GARBAGE!!!!!!!"
3,Not an unpleasant read but a bit outdated,"Courtesy of A Romance ReviewThe plots and characters of the stories in I Do are similar. The heroes are rich, handsome, successful but arrogant. The heroines are hardworking, successful but weak. The only excuse the heroes have in marrying the heroines is to solve the heroines' financial problem but actually they are desperate to make them their wives. Although the heroines fight hard to support themselves, they finally concede to marry the heroes under different circumstances. I Do isn't an unpleasant read though the stories are a bit outdated."
2,Poor manufacturing quality control,"The bowl is mechanically interlocked with the lid. There were molding spurs inside the lock area and I had to carve them out with a knife before we could close the lid so that the motor could run. Considering the price, this was inexcusable."
4,great,"it was delivered quickly and it was a direct replacement for what i had. this was keeping me from using my food processor, so it was great to get back to using it."
4,Works good,I have a 12 + year old KFP580 11 cup food processor. This bowl does fit that food processor. Like others have stated its a little stiff with the new cover I purchased with it. I think it's the cover that's the problem. To remedy that I can lightly file the offending piece down. The only qualm I have with this item is the handle. It doesn't come with the white grip part on the outside as pictured. I'll take the one off the old work bowl. I don't know if it is meant to be replaced that way time & again as eventually that part is going to fail.... I would think it would come with a new handle grip piece as part of the handle assembly. ???? Overall very happy to even find replacement parts for a still perfectly good food processor. The cover was the KitchenAid 4176263 Bowl Cover.
4,Don't listen to the negative reviews,"This game is a little challenging, but what would be the point of playing if it wasn't? It's a little slow on my dinosaur computer but that was expected. If you read the charts on the walls (CMEs) the game is a lot less challenging. The game is almost impossible without reading the charts. I love disaster strikes and life or death, they are my faves. ER2 leaves a little to be desired, but it's older and different. The game is fun and makes you work hard and think. It's fun inserting IVs and drawing blood. This game is a must have if you want to be in the medical professions in the future. I am 16 and am not an video game player, so I'm a beginner at any kind of game, so if I can do this than probably any one with a little experience with games can."
3,okay,It's okay. It would've been better if the store sent me what I ordered. I wanted it all black but what I got was black on the top and beige(cork looking) base.
4,True Island flavor-----,"This CD is fun for everyone. It places you on a beach in the sunny Bahamas, despite the fact that you are listening in a plastic patio chair from Target in your stateside, boring backyard. Who would believe that these same Bahamen would go on to record one of the most hideous pop-nightmares some ten years later: ""Who Let the Dogs Out???"" This is far from that. I don't know the story behind the band's transformation.....I won't say they sold out to the demands of pop culture/music, because I dont know that to be the case, but this CD is pure fun and authentic island music. I dont think anyone could argue that Dogs Out is. Regardless, no trip to the Keys, Bahamas or Carribbean would be properly anticipated without this in your cd player. Great, if you can find it!"
5,I LOVE THIS CD!!!!!!!,"This CD is a MUST for those Bahamians living away from home for any period of time. As a born Bahamian, I feel that these very talented, Bahamian musicians have done an excellent job of combining the Junkanoo beat with Bahamian vocals. I reiterate, I LOVE THIS CD!!!!"
1,This is calipso trying to be passed off as junkanoo,"There is no voice or harmony in junkanoo other than an combined shout admidst the percusion, bells, whistles etc. The bahamas have annual contests for the best Junkanoo Band. This group does not qualify for Junkanoo period. If you want to hear real Junkanoo, go to the Princess Casino in Bahama and go to they're show. I don't know if they're still there, but at the end of the show they have a Junkanoo band that will make the hair stand up on the back of your neck. I think the head of the band was named Robbie."
1,Item not as described!,"I had to return this because although the item description said it was a set of 5 busts, I only received one.Very frustrating to have to find time to return and reorder at a higher price!"
1,DANGEROUS - skip it.,"This same thing is sold under other brand names - bottom line, the design is flawed. The push angle and down-pressure is a great idea, but unfortunately the notch is a little too shallow, allowing the 'heel' to slip off the work as you push forward, making it more dangerous than no push stick at all! Mine went in the trash after the first cut almost put me into the blade. You don't need this - cut a good 'down-pressure' push stick out of scrap plywood or MDF. There are tons of patterns online."
1,Why not ship the tape with the tools and drawings?,"Santa brought this tape for my daughter, but in the video lesson several different items that were required to perform the lessons weren't supplied with the tape, and so it was very disappointing. At least two drawings that are needed are missing and further on some other things that are called for were not supplied with the tape either, and the middle of the lessons. Apparently as a surprise, you need the workbooks and the tools too, which cost extra."
5,Fantastic,This is a great product. When we received it we assumed it might be alittle complicated to put together but we were wrong. Everything is in the bag just pull it out and in 2 easy steps it's all together and this is just as easy to take down. Very comfortable and sturdy. Made with good quality fabric that will last a long time. I can't stress how affordable this was. We received our shipment earlier than expected. You will miss out if you don't purchase this product.
2,Elbows,"The hammock folds out flat but, after a person lies on it, one sinks between the folding elbows and one is cramped between the protruding supports."
5,Adventures of Tom Sawyer,"I'm not going to rate this movie b/c I want to see it on DVD. This is the classic version of Twain's novel. It's out on DVD region 2, why doesn't Amazon have a copy for region 1?"
4,The best film adaptation of Twain's novel ever done,"The book and this movie became the staple of my childhood, Growing up less than 50 miles from where all this took place, I was enthralled with the museums, the cave and the other houses in Hannibal..This movie truly captured the romantic boyhood of Tom Sawyer (Sam Clemens). It is hard sometimes to know where the book stops and the movie takes over. Other Hollywood adaptations of this story have turned out silly, but this one will always hold up well. Buy it, watch it, treasure it, and go back to it again and again!"
1,Tom Sawyer DVD book,I was disappointed with what i ordered. I thought I was ordering the Tom Sawyer movie instead of the words from the book spoken. I also ordered Huckleberry Finn and that was a movie and i really enjoyed it.Thanks for your time.Shelby
5,Adventures of Tom Sawyer Walter Brennan,"I liked this very much the characters of Tom, Huck, Sydney were all well portrayed and especially enjoyed Walter Brennan at a younger age than he was in the Real McCoys and The One and Only Original Family Band."
3,buny-in-the-headlights,"very enjoyable family film version of this classic story, i remember watching this on TV in my younger days and it has lost none of its' appeal with the passing of years"
2,I'm about to go medieval on your...,"You should be ashamed to have shipped this item, considering the state it was in. The gauntlets were filthy, caked with dust, stained, and had scrapes. They definitely DO NOT look as presentable as the image suggests. Did someone from Medieval Times wear this to a banquet after jousting? Avoid, seriously."
4,Impressive product,"These are pretty durable things, definitely look more impressive in real life than the picture displayed. The metal is sturdy and able to take plenty of abuse, though the gloves aren't the finest quality or as sturdy. Don't let that dissuade you from purchasing them, they are superb and worth the money.If you are able to, I recommend tweaking them a bit to fit your hands. As they came they weren't extremely comfortable or articulated, though a couple pair of pliers will do the trick."
2,Porrly made.,"These, gauntlets, are frankly, horribly made, they were cheap and thus cheaply made. The one attachment from the left glove feel broke almost as soon as a got it out of the box and another glove to gauntlet attachment broke off as I was showing it to my Mom. I'll be shipping these gauntlets back promptly. My advice to any wannabe Medieval fighter fighter is the contact a local SCA chapter and learn how to make your own gauntlets from them or buy some of theirs. These armorers see firsthand how rigorous hand to hand combat is so they know what it takes to make something up to snuff. These gauntlets are Wonderfuls On Wall Wall Hangers Only Stuff."
2,review,My brother got these and at first they seemed cool but then it seemed that they were falling apart they look cool on the outside andthere fun to use but there craply made. the metal on the fingers are tinny metal plats and it doesnt take much for them to fall offthe metal all over the glove itself isnt very well put on and isnt very strong plz people do not buy this peace of crap its for your own goodtrust me
1,The Best Gauntlets that People Will Think Are Homemade,"Take these bad boys to any Halloween party and prepare to have people regale at your handyness. Just make sure to not reveal your secret (that you paid $50 for them on Amazon). Made out of the finest scrap metal, this is probably the best way to overpay $50 for two over-sized cans of baked beans. They're lined with the most opulent leather hide for minimal comfort when adorned."
3,Medival Gauntlets,"The Shipping was fast and it was well packaged. However there were a few nicks and marks on them,my husband says he can just sand them out and fix them. I choose to believe they add authenticity to them, so I will be keeping them. All in all it looks great and will just be on display in our home anyway. I would buy from here again."
4,Fantastic for the price.,"Incredible aesthetic, impressive build quality. Leather glove fitted with scale-like plates and BIG forearm guards. The gauntlets are very large, and fit well.The underside of the metal is a bit rusty and dirty, but it isn't a problem.Also, all the moving/loose parts cause it to scratch up within a few hours of purchase. The scratches don't look bad though- they add character. But if you are looking for gauntlets that will remain pristine they aren't for you.Very happy with my purchase."
3,Johnston narration of NKJV,"Stephen Johnstons voice is fine and the content of the bible is of course important, however I found the 'soft' instrumental background extreamely distracting! If background noise during reading time doesnt bother you normally then it may not be distracting to you, but to all others, I would recommend buying a voice only version."
1,Distracting,"Even though the product is described as having ""soothing"" or ""soft"" background music, the music is very annoying. It is so distracting that it takes away from the pure reading of God's word. Consequently, I rarely listen to the CDs. It is a shame that the producers thought that they could improve on the pure product. I have recently purchased the NKJV read by Johnny Cash. Although his voice is not as polished, as far as I am concerned, the Bible is read reverently and at a good pace. It is an overall superior product, but unfortunately, it is only available in the New Testament."
1,Nothing Special,"This is a weak survey of African-American ""vernacular art"". There are a few pieces of artwork shown for the various artists covered and a short bio. Nothing in depth in terms of the artwork shown or the information given. This is basically your standard collection of the usual suspects in folk art today. A little bit of Dial, Tolliver, Young, Burnside, Light, etc. And the pieces shown aren't that special. It's great they've got a couple of Mose Tolliver's, but they aren't that special in the overall spectrum of Mose's work. Since nothing is in-depth, I'm not really sure what the point of this book is as it adds nothing new to the field. It's great Ronald and June Shelp own all these pieces, but so what? Good for them, but the book adds nothing for the reader. A much better survey is Souls Grown Deep. Much more expensive, but well worth it."
5,A lot better than I expected,"When I first saw this collection become available, I figured it was just some cheap, budget line collection. Probably wouldn't have any notes, and would just be a hodge podge of recordings.Well, one night I got brave and ordered it. Holy smokes!!! I'd say as of right now, this is the definitive Red Foley collection. It contains his first recordings from 1933, and hits almost all of his top 10 hits. Only ""Our Lady of Fatima,"" ""Slaves of a Hopeless Love Affair,"" and ""Jilted"" are omitted.All of the recordings have great sound, and are all the original masters. Nothing from his double greatest hits remake album from the mid 60's are included.The booklet is another revelation. Probably in the same league with a Bear Family booklet, it features great notes, and individual recording dates.This collection is a steal for the price it's available for. You really don't need to be hesitant when thinking about purchasing it."
4,Hilarious - an anarchist text book disguised as xian history,"I still read it every now and then, just for a good laugh.I think it has an excellent thought provoking hypothesis and may well be closer to the truth than other current ideas about christ.People complain about the writing, which is average at best, but it was never intended to be high literature.Read it and enjoy . . ."
3,An Entertaining Mess,"As others below note, this is a horribly written novel with a great premise: Christianity was founded by a vampire. Makes perfect sense: isn't communion just Jesus' followers drinking his blood? With tongue in cheek, Eccarius exploits the concept pretty well, then wanders off into a confusing ""noble anarchists vs. the Pope and his vampire legions"" plot, draining any momentum he's built as surely as a parish priest drains an altarboy of B negative. Eccarius should sell the concept to a competent writer-- what would Dan Brown do with this??"
2,An interesting idea executed by an incompetent writer,"This is a fascinating idea, written in the style of the religious pamphlets people hand out on subways. The grand conspiracy of vampires is entertaining, but the book suffers from poor proofreading, poor characterization, a disjointed plot and absolutely awful writing. Had the author teamed up with another, more talented, writer, and refrained from inserting all the left-wing and anarchist philosophy, this might deserve comparison to the Illuminatus! Trilogy."
2,ugh,"The book has a very creative premise, which offers all kinds of possibilities, but Eccarius' writing style (if it can be called that) seriously undermines any chance this book had at being good. One line that struck me as especially bad came when a group of male anarchists were standing around, ""calculating, subconsciously, the probability of getting into their (the female anarchists') respective pants. In a nice manner, of course, fully respective of their humanity."" Eccarius' underwhelming talent pretty much wipes out any possibility this book had of being taken seriously. This is a shame, because, as I said, he starts with a great premise."
2,Kindle version almost unusable,"Although the content of the book is good, the Kindle conversion was done very poorly. All the Greek text is grainy, blurry, and hard to read. The accents and breath marks are impossibly to make out. This makes it almost useless."
5,My little comment on an authentic book,"By far this is the best written book on NT Greek syntax at the intermediate level. I have read the book twice. If any comment I could make, I would say the book is slightly too rigid and a bit long-winded with the definition and identification sections. David Alan Black's It's Still Greek To Me would provide a simpler and shorter treatise. Wallace's text is a must read in the end."
3,Wrong Color,"The pillowcases are nothing special, and the light blue is more of a dirty white or gray than light blue. The color in my opinion is not even a close match to the picture listed with this item. If you are looking for a good light blue pillowcase then i suggest that you go somewhere else because these are not light blue."
5,Fabulous,This has some songs from when I was growing up and getting my first boyfriend.In the midst of puppy love. It brings back the memories of innocence when the world was a little easier to live in.
5,Cantina takes you on a mini-vacation,"Cantina was the first cook book in the Casual Cusine series that I purchased, and of all my many cookbooks, it is the one that I use most often. The Beer BatteredShrimp with Chipolte-Honey Sauce has quickly become a family and party favorite as have the Sea Bass Ceviche with Lime and Cilantro and the Chiles Rellenos. Our friends have been known to invite themselves over for dinner and they usually request that I make these dishes.The book is laid out with simple-to- follow recipies and corresponding, beautifully shot photos of each dish. Just add a secluded tropical beach with Mariachi music in the background, someone else to do the dishes, and you've got your own little piece of heaven."
5,"sassy,smart, easy to carry panini","Love it! Though it doesn't have dials, just plug in an let it get hot, it has been a boon for me to carry to work, and it makes great paninis'. Arrived on time, and in top condition, and it looks pretty. For a portable panini, can't beat this gem."
5,Da Bomb! Dis CD is TIGHT & OFF DA HOOK!!!,"Das EFX's classic, great, excellent, brilliant, fantastic and debut joint is one of my all-time favorite albums. If you like east coast rap, then check this out!! This CD is very slept-on, Das EFX represent real hip-hop 2 the fullest, youknowhatimsayin'?!!"
5,Dasheikz2Centz: I Diggity Make The Wonder Twins Deactivate. Whoooey!!,"How could u give this album anything but 5 stars, mics whatever. This is the most original and imitated group and album of all time! IZ u STUPID?!! Man! I played this album over and over and over... These dudes should definitely be in the Hip-Hop Hall Of Fame! And don't listen to fools that say some of these tracks are wack. There are no whack Das Efx songs anywhere in the world. Buy this one. Definitely."
4,Copied but never duplicated,"Das Efx was one of the most immitated artists in the early 90's.Lyrically and style wise they were as original as it comes.Even there look was unlike any other. There are a few filler songs on this cd. But They want efx, Microphone checkerand Straight from the Sewer are 3 classics.Even the videosfor each of these songs stand the test of time in there originalty.And if your tired of rap songs and videos looking and soundinglike commercials for whatever products these new artists are endorsing. Then You will love Das Efx. From the parka jackets to the gas masks there is nothing pretty about these cats. Thisis music for men made by men before all these artists cateredto females (ll.cool j) .All in all this is a classic album. That no real hip-hop fanshould be without."
5,Ya-hoo shiver me timbers yo head for the hills,"This Cd from DAS EFX features some of the most clever wordplay in the hisotry of hip hop (so far). Lots of fun and cryptic gags from Generation -X cartoons and commericals (the references to weebils, holly hobbies, more parks sausages mom-pleasae, etc). Lots of imagination and creativity here that's filled with danceable beats and just plain FUN, soething that's been missing from the rap world in recent times. This is the kind of Cd that you use to get together with your friends for a berr-and pizza session and just trip out and have a good time."
4,Damn Good...a classic,"They don't make rap like this anymore....this ranks up there in skill, tightness, and lyrical cleverness and fortitude with Tribe and De La. BUY IT....."
1,Surprised and disappointed,"I was expecting to hear the music from the actual show; this is not what this cd is. It's alright in its own way, but not at all as enjoyable as the real music. True, there are some familiar tunes that have been rearranged, but on the whole, I'm rather disappointed."
3,"Great music, but little Cirque flavour","The music good; however, it lacks the Cirque flavour. The tracks tend to get too ""meditational"". Most of the songs that were played during the live performance are not on the album. That lack is frustrating! The CD has more of a ""chillout"" flavour. The vocalists, at times, seem to interfere with the music rather than add intensity and emotion. I think the new Cirque composer that made her first Cirque CD for the Dralion show, takes the certain magic out. The magic that was present in shows before Dralion. Rene Dupere's and Benoit Jutras's compositions were far better. This CD, like Dralion, doesn't belong in the Cirque category and should have been placed simply under New Age."
4,Slow to Start,"As with some Cirque CD's they take some getting used to. The first five tracks of this album (over half an hour)is not fun to listen to and are going to take quite a bit of time to get used to. One of these tracks is over 9 minutes long! Fortunately, from track 6 on the CD soars with unique upbeat tracks that I love."
3,Dull in comparison,"This was the second Cirque CD I bought. I find it very dull and over electronic, compared to the show with the most creative and beautiful energy in Cirque's history. I must say it is disappointing that only 3 of the 13 songs can be recognized from the show. But hope is not lost...the Cirque just released a ""Premium Edition"" with a bunch of live songs from the show. Buy that one if you want a good CD. This one may cause Cirque disappointment."
2,Missing the emotion of the show.,"I agree with the other reviewers. I bought this CD with the expectation that it was either a Soundtrack or very closely resembled the show.They are nothing alike and, personally, I think the CD lacks ALL of the emotion of the real show. Which is a huge shame, because Varekai was one of my favorite travelling Cirque shows.I hope this isn't the route that Cirque is going with their future shows. If so, I doubt I'll buy more CDs (huge shame because I have every CD for the shows that I've seen - 4 or 5 travelling shows & 3 theatre shows)."
5,A GREAT STAND ALONE CD,"As many reviewers have stated, this soundtrack is different than the live musical score. It is supposed to be. Cirque and Violaine Corradi decided to take a different approach than usual and created an album of songs perfect for the World Music genre. At first, I too was dissapointed because I had seen Varekai live several times and knew the music well. But when I blocked out the live show score in my mind and listened to the CD for what it is, I can't quit listening to it. Singer, Zara Tellander, is simply amazing."
4,High-tech & high-concept world-beat circus music,"Cirque du Soleil's super-crosscultural mix of Arabic, gypsy, classical, modern pop and ambient electronic music will come as a welcome treat for folks who enjoy baroque, ornate ""world fusion"" efforts by the likes of Jai Uttal or Dead Can Dance... Violaine Corradi composed the music, along with a slew of guest performers and collaborators, ranging from gypsy traditionalists Taraf de Haidouks, Natacha Atlas and '60s space-folkie Terry Callier. May be a bit much for the more traditionally-minded world music fans, but others will find it well-crafted and emotionally powerful."
2,What might have happened,"At the last minute the lead singer for the show was fired. That might explain why the songs on the CD are a bit different from the ones in the show. That said, however, the music is still mindblowing. Eerie melodies and amazing vocals that lift the spirits. I'm a big big fan all of the Cirque soundtracks and this is no exception. I can't wait to see the show."
2,Okay to start with,This is a book u buy if you are just looking to findout what vb is all about it doesn't go indepth at all and gave some topics in a very bad form it is just a scrath on the surface but it is okay if u don't really want to apply the knowledge you are supposed to be gaining.
2,VB6 in 24 hours... kinda,"As an old DOS programmer that left the field because of Windows programming demands, I was pleasantly surprised at the ease one can program in VB6. This book, however, was not a good investment. It's true you get what you pay for. There's a number of code and editing errors here that one can lose time scratching one's head over. I'd suggest going with the Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Learning Edition instead. Despite a higher investment."
4,Missing CD,"Received the book which was supposed to have a CD in it. The reason I orderred this was because I had the book already and the CD broke. I orderred it as used because it did not indicate the CD was missing. Ihad to return it and orderred a new one in its place. The return and reorder were painless and I got the CD, just a bit later than I expected to"
1,I don't get it!,After reading through hour 7 (a fair 100 pages) I was completely bogged down with this book. It spends 4-5 pages explaining focus (something any windows user understands in about 2 seconds) then races through 4-5 pages of solid terms with no explaination as to why they are important or to what use they will be. This makes understanding very difficult and also makes for a very boring read. Very disapointed with this purchase and would not recommend this book to anyone.
1,Your Computer Stands At Idle As You Read,"The book for most part has good information for beginners but I found your reading code more than your ""actually"" doing hands on programming with Visual Basic.The only thing that appealed to me to buy it was the control creation edition 5 on the CD. Lucky for me I bought another book from Microsoft Press by Micheal Halvorson the step by step guide, now it makes more sense. If you buy this edition, you may want another book which you can learn ""Hands on"". You spend more than 8 chapters reading before any real exercises surface in this book. That's way too long, and little boring if your first starting out. Just buy it for the CCE, and start with another book, works for me!"
4,Filled in most of the holes,"I had a basic knoledge of vb and some knoledge of random advanced topics befoer i read this book. After I read this book, it willed in all the holes that i never learned about and allowed me to move on to move advanced books. The reason that is had 4 stars, not 5 is because in the last few chapters, it goes through advanced topics without explaining it. I recomend this book for beginners and beginner-intermediates."
2,curly covers,"In the paperback version, this book's covers curl away from the book! I've found no method to correct this fault and am looking forward to the day the pages start falling out as they do in my other Sam's books."
4,"Good, but a little longwinded!","This is a good book, but it spends too much time on theory than actually coding applications.Of course, for a beginner, that's exactly how it should be. The devolpment process is impossible if you don't know how it works. (Most books just tell you that 'it works'. Not the way it should be.)Of course, it is a bit long. They could have cut some stuff out and made it clearer, but overall, it's great.One note, though. If you've never programmed before, try one of the 'Beginning Programming' books, and learn an early BASIC language, first. It'll help you immensly with Visual Basic!One major gripe: the book constantly addresses features that aren't availiable in the included sample version of Visual Basic. For some reason, it expects all of its readers have the Visual Basic Professional Edtion..."
2,Do you really have time to read all that?,Not bad for someone likes to read alot. It talks too much and not enough labs to cover the real hands on exercises.
2,"ok, but look for another book when youre done reading it",like all the 24 hour books I've read so far this book only scraches the surface of what you can do with VB. I recomend staying away from the 24 hour books they either try to put everything in 24 lessons or streach it to that. You need more than 24 lessons to really learn vb. You would be better off buying a VB bible which is one of the best books I've seen on the subject.
2,Good if you want to learn how to make little boxes,"OK, get this everyone... dont start w/ this book. it goes too fast and doesnt tell you enough about what the heck its talking about. It doesnt teach you ""coding"" more or less about how to make boxes, i read to about chapter 5 and i hadnt even gotten out variables... wtf?Heres what i did and now im at C++ and doing fineGet :Beginning Programming For DummiesVisual Basic 6 for complete idiotsSearch online.. play around a lot w/ visual basicTeach Yourself C++ Edition 6. (This book is a godsend)"
4,"A Very Good Book. Not Great, but Very Good.","Being completely new to VB, I bought this book to get me up and running, and it has done that. I agree with some of the other reviews about how it's kind of long winded in some parts, and light in others. Definitely not a definitive book, but to get you going quickly, it gets the job done!My only beef with it is that the instructions given in Lesson 19 on how to create a toolbar don't work, and when you install the code from the CD it fails to load. Every other lesson was great though, especially if you're one who can learn from examples.I'd reccomend it as a step into VB programming, just be prepared to continue with other books when you're done with this one."
2,How to become a professional debugger in 9 hours or less.,"Well I first became interested in VB after seeing what could be done in a short amount of time as compared to other languages such as C/C++ (which I have studied for about 2 years). The book starts off like any other book, however it gets worse as it goes on. The first couple chapters (1-8) are decent, showing you code, explaining things, and having you actually do some of the projects. In chapter 9 however things start to change. Errors in his code start to become annoying and your projects won't compile. Later in chapter 11 he begins talking about subjects such as the Timer Control and provides no code to show you how to interact with it. After chapter 11 the author just seemed to loose his esteem and eventually lost mine too. I also wouldn't recommend buying the Teach your VB in 21 Days book either as it is written by the same author."
1,Totally and completely bogus book,"There is absolutely no value in this book. The elementary postulate has been broken - teaching computer language without any examples, nothing! That is not the way to learn. Author spends pages and pages in endless blabber about the features of VB without presenting any examples. The book itself is an example of how to earn quick buck from naive looking for elementary tutorial. Shameful."
2,Visual Basic Commercial,"This book does an excellent job of singing the praises of VB's interface without giving away any of the code to make them useful. Consider it more of an overview to Visual Basic, but dont plan on learning any script here."
2,More Money Well Spent on Microsoft Product Promotion,"Even if you got this on sale as I did, I think you'd be better off saving your money as well as your time by getting VB Step By Step by Micheal Halvorson. The Halvorson book happens to be published by Microsoft Press, but the author likes to teach programming and shows you VB by code examples; he is also objective and doesn't waste your time making obsequious praise and promotion of Microsoft brand PRODUCTS as this Sams book does. Unless of course you like paying money to read advertising copy telling you how great Microsoft is and why all its products are flawless. Funny, because I thought this book was going to be a book on programming."
2,useless and confusing,"I am prety good with computers, so one day I decided to get into programming. I talked to a friend of mine who programs for a living and he told me to start with visual basic. I picked up a copy of ""Sams Teach yourself visual basic in 24 hours"" and eagerly opened it up when i got home. I found the opening chapters over explained and repetitive, but despite my incredible boredom i forced myself to move on. I eventually read up to about chapter 10 when i became totally confused. The provided examples would sometimes not work, and it left me frustrated. So there i was, stranded in the middle of this book, consed, bored and frustrated. After that day, i put down the book, and i havent opened it since, and im happy i didn't."
3,Good X-Mas movie,"I don't really dig Danza, but he did well here. I nean, the whole thing was very Christmasy. It makes me feel good.Dave"
4,Tony and Lea,"The best part of this movie is the chemistry between Lea Thompson and Tony Danza. Betty White is also in the film, but don't expect the saucy Betty. This time she's sweet and grandmotherly. But she plays this part as well as the saucy gal. The story of a crook in a Santa Suit getting on a bus and arriving at a town in time to play a Santa is of course far fetched but, remember it's Christmas."
3,A cute Christmas redemption story,"My wife and I both thought the movie was an okay Christmas redemption story, to go along with the slew of Christmas movies that we watched, but it didn't really stand out as a real special one."
5,One of my favorite Christmas movies!,"This is a great movie for anyone! Tony D. is one of my favorite actors of all time! He is and always will be so talented as an actor and is so handsome too, don't you think? He will capture your heart in so many ways. You really need to check this movie out! Sit down on a cold winter evening with your sweetie and check it out! It will warm your heart but not bore your man either. This is a wonderful movie for everybody especially around Christmas time.I love it! Give is a look! You may be surprised. Its a really cool and interesting movie. He plays a criminal who makes mistakes, meets good people then changes for the good. There is plenty of drama, action, etc for everybody to enjoy. Hats off to you Tony! You are an incredible man/actor is SOOOO many ways! Sincerely! Merry Christmas everybody!!!!"
5,An Awesome Christmas Film!!!,"Around this time of year, we watch Christmas movies, and this is a new Christmas classic to add to the mix. I love the plot. It reminds me of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Everybody was perfectly cast. Tony Danza stars as a thief named Jack Clayton. When Jack is about to be caught at the mall, he dresses up as Santa Claus and hops on the bus to Evergreen. He is mistaken for the new Santa at Sarah Gibson's tree store. He is very reluctant at first, but after becoming a part of the town, and falls in love with Sarah, he begins to have second thoughts on robbing Evergreen's bank. I highly recommend STEALING CHRISTMAS!!!"
4,Great Movie - List of the Soundtrack ???,"Hi EveryoneI have recently seen this movie and loved it 2 days before ChristmasReally enjoyed the soundtrack hymns played by the various artistsDoes anyone know where i could obtain a list of these songs?In Particular who sang ""Its Christmas time again?""Can anyone help meAppreciate your feedback...Cheers and Merry Christmas !!!"
4,"Awww, They Are Not That Bad","The glass indeed looks good and have a nice modern spin to it, as the liquid it holds seems to float on air. However, the previous reviewer was right that the glass is too lightweight and plastic-looking, and might be misconstrued as flimsy. But I am not holding this ""bad"" feature against it. On the contrary, I like it precisely because it is not heavy. Although, the durability question remains to be answered yet. For the price I paid, this is a bargain."
1,totally unacceptable,"This product is extremely cheaply made. It is made of such cheap material, me and my girlfriend are both convinced that its made out of clear plastic, rather than glass. The cup walls are so thin, I don't feel safe putting any hot or cold liquid in it."
2,water logged,These mugs are fabulous until they have been washed in the dishwater several times. I have purchased over a dozen and have two workable mugs. They are NOT dishwasher safe.
2,Seemed like a great deal,"I was thrilled to have these glasses (4 for the price of what is usually one) and immediately put them to use, as I drink a considerable amount of tea. However, it's not even 3 weeks later and the vacuum seal has already broken and created condensation on the inside of one glass, even though I keep them wrapped up in bubblewrap in my drawer. Needless to say I'm pretty disappointed with the quality. I bought some 2.5 ounce bodum tea glasses, however, and despite their small size, the silicone plugs in them allow better ""breathing"" so the glass doesn't crack or score and break the vacuum seal. Wouldn't recommend the Luigi Bormioli unless you want some vacuum-looking (not functional) glasses."
3,"Looks Great, Feels Cheap!","It looks great with coffee inside, but it's really light and cries out that it's a cheap product. If you want glass (and class) go for something else."
2,Wrong Size Listed,"These claim to be 10oz glasses, but are more like 6oz. That said..they are super lightweight, it almost feels like you are going to break them (although none have). They are great for insulating, you can put something really hot in them, and the outside of the glass is perfectly normal.But they are way too small to be usable by any current American standard."
1,Not really impressed with them.,"The product dimension is listed completely wrong. The glass is about 4 1/2 inches tall, bottom is about 2 1/2 inches wide and mouth is about 3 1/4 inches wide. It is taller and slimmer than pictured. I guess because it is so light it felt a little like a clear acrylic cup instead of glass. If you use this for a 2 cup coffee from a senseo machine, you coffee will overflow because it is smaller inside. Overall, I was expecting a more elegant looking glass than it actually is. They are not worth the price listed. But since I got such a great deal buying 4 sets for the price of 1 set, I'm going to keep them."
3,Damage in making them,"We were so excited getting these cups, a friend had them and we just knew they were going to be great, and until I washed them, they were. I washed all four in the same water, etc.. and one came up with soap bubbles and a fair amount of water inside the cup. My hubby looked further, and found the very bottom of the cup is ""finished"" right on the bottom, so there is a little dimple sort of. The one cup had a dimple that wasnt closed, so thats where the leak came from. I went to Amazon.com to see if there was a phone number to get one replaced...guess what? No phone number.. so I have to send them back, at my expense...not fair at all. They are willing to send me another set, but I have to pay for it both ways.. not right. There is no one to talk to, so I could explain what happened. Be careful, buy locally. I will from now on. Sorry Amazon, you should be willing to take care of your customers on the phone, if they have a problem. Customer service is a dying art."
5,Great Rendition of the Celtic myths,"Much like the rest of the Myth and Mankind series this book does a great job of combining both the historical and mythical aspects of the Celtic and anglo cultures of early Europe. The book as well provides brilliant pictures of artifacts for the stories and gives great explanations as well as connections of the myths and the actual history of the region.The folklore as well is well written in this book as well and is often told interestingly as well as short enough that it isn't too time consuming but not so short that it takes away from the overall point.The book is simply a great book in both its mythic as well as comparative feats and is easily a great read to pick up again and again, I know I have. I would highly recommend bying this book and as well checking out the rest of the series, which spans the whole world and every major civilization, providing both amazing cultural information as well as pictures and great myths from every aspect of life."
2,Residue!!!,I was very excited about this soap and the first time I used it I was very impressed with the smell and lather. It wasn't until I tried to rinse off that I noticed a very soapy residue on my skin. I had to wash all over again with another body wash to get it off. Maybe its a bar soap thing but I just couldn't do the residue/squeky feeling
1,wrong item,"send me the wrong soap --- send me the lavender thing instead of the original order like in the photo coconut & papaya soap. that's mis representation, who would do that? that's illegal. will be returning ASAP."
5,Quick and Easy with good results,"I hate to have to reconfigure my system every time I add a periphal. My best luck has come with the canoscan N67OU. I turned off my pc, plugged the cable in the USB port (no power plugs to mess with), started up the pc and loaded some cool gui programs and I was done. I like the fact that I am in control of the resoltion of the output.I don't usually take the time to review a product but this one merited the effort."
5,Great Scaner..!!,"I just got this scanner and it is super easy to use. Another thing I like about it is that it is super thin and that it is capable of scanning thick books. i Totally recommend it, another cool thing is that it only uses one cable to power on. I love it. :D"
5,Canoscan N670U,"Installation was easy and fast. The scanner is connected to USB HUB with self-powered mode. It works fine. I scanned a 4x6 normal silver halide color print at 300 dpi. It took only 25 seconds. Then I made a color photo print at 1440 dpi( As you know, several printer dots make each pixel in image). It was very acceptable quality for relativery picky casual user like me. In my case, I couldn't find any white specs and dust on my printed out photo. Anyway, this is not a film scanner. We can't expect super high resolution from scanning color photo prints. Scanned image from art work is very crisp and accurate in color."
1,No driver for Compaq presario 1720US on XP Home,Do NOT buy this if you have a Compaq Presario 1700 series running in XP. Call Canon first before buying this to ensure proper drivers are available. Compaq does not have them.
3,can't program buttons,"It has those buttons on the from but you cannot program them to say, launch photoshop. At least you can't on the macintosh. I like that it has no power cord, drawing power from the USB cord however. And it's very slim allowing it to be easily stored on it's side.One big downside is that canon doesn not support Mac OSx! why not, get with it."
1,Incompetence Glorified,"This scanner was shipped to me without an installation disk. I contacted the seller and requested a disk. The seller promised to mail the disk. A week went by. I again contacted the seller. The seller insisted that he had mailed the disk. Frustrated, I contacted Amazon to asked for instructions on obtaining a refund. Amazon informed me that I would have to contact the seller, but supplied no contact information. I threw the scanner into the dumpster. Last week, the postoffice informed me they were holding a postage due item. It was the missing disk, mailed without sufficient postage. Incompetence personified."
4,Fun so far,"Just got it and have scanned in 4-6 photos. Software was easy to load and seems compatible with Win'98. Scanner easy to use too, and great image quality.My only criticism has to do with the documentation they don't provide. Very slim manual that doesn't cover functions like copying documents. Still haven't figured out how to do this."
2,"""Specks of dust"" on photo scans","Photo Scanning: Every Color Photo that I scanned resulted in images that looked like there were little specks of dust on the image. Yes, I changed the setting that purports to remedy this issue, but it did not adequately correct this problem.Setup: Straightforward, documented and easySpeed: Not as long as I had anticipated for a 4x6 photo, based on the other commentsNoise level: Its noisier than my old Umax, but not overly soSize/Appearance: Nearly perfect, if you do not need legal size scanning"
1,Broken from the start,"I was very disappointed to wait on this scanner for a week and a half for it to not work straight out of the box. As mentioned in a couple of other reviews, the scanning mechanism got stuck. It started scanning and then returned and made a horrible noise. The normal scanning operation seemed to be pretty loud even before it got stuck."
1,Flimsy,"At first, this scanner performed expertly. High resolution, relatively high-speed scanning, no external power cord, compact. Besides a few minor software glitches, it seemed too good to be true.To complete the tawdry cliche, it was. A few months out, it got stuck. That is, the scanning mechanism literally got stuck to the front edge of the scanner. It made funny noises and stopped working. Dead.As an example of the poor workmanship, when you press one of the buttons on it firmly, but not hard enough to break any decent piece of electronics, the mechanism moves. That is, the scanning mechanism is indirectly attached to the buttons you push to turn it on! Try it at a store display! When the mechanism moves by a firm button press, the extremely thin metal rod that holds everything in place bends like a piece of wire in a [garbage] compactor. That can't be good.Although the scanning itself is fine, this scanner is extremely flimsy and is sure to break after a sure period of normal use."
1,A Complete Disaster,"I was attracted by its slim design and the canon name. What I got was a very cheaply manufactured and highly defective product with massive software problems. The moving arm is noisy and constantly gets jammed making scanning photographs a nightmare. The software for the Mac is of the bundled nature and crashes constantly. There is a jumble of five different titles which look and operate poorly and cheaply. They are poorly integrated and guaranteed to crash even the best maintained system. They are not supported by the software companies who refuse to provide updates for ""bundled"" versions. None of these applications works well -- if at all -- in System X or in Classic and updates are not available, despite Canon's assurances. The thing completely fell apart after 90 days, after which it was too late for me to return the product. It's not even deep enough to make into a cat litter box, its only real suitable purpose.Avoid it and all other Canon scanners like the plague"
5,The best $80 I ever spent!,"I did some research on scanners and this seemed to be the best one in its price range. It IS. I've scanned about a hundred pictures in the 5 months since I bought it, and haven't had any problems. The detail and color on scanned photos are great. The scanner has definitely paid for itself, as I don't have to buy any more kodak picture cds to be able to email photos to relatives. The scanner comes with photo editing software but I prefer adobe photoshop. I recommend this scanner to everyone."
4,Gulf Coast ~ West Coast ~ Connect..,"This CD is about Lil' Flip n Mr. Capone-E got together to Represent the 'Connected' Cali-Tex styles.. I gave it a 4 Star Rating cuz ders no real song i can consider 'Cool' to jam to.. ;l its mostly just 'Feestylin' n soft rapping. But there is one song I just heard that is Worthy of liking, its Number 13 - ""In H-Town"".. You see, me, im a SouthSider, and Lil' Flip being the SouthSider Rapper he is, keeps ""Us"" SouthSiders Well Represented with this song.. Oh, and for the Price of this CD i say Get It.. Its an Original CD for a real cheap price, what more do you want, Add It To Your Collection, That's What i Did.. TigreLoko24.."
5,Warm ski bibs,Love these bibs! True to size and warm! Went spring skiing and actually found them too warm. Going to Telluride soon so the true test is pending but not worried as they are very warm and water proof (this is really important to a beginner skiier as myself!!!). Can't wait to use them again.
4,women's ski bibs,"I got the bibs right away and they fit great. They are not too heavy, but I bought them to play outside with our kids and go sledding and for that they are perfect!!"
1,Returned,Niot as good quality as expected. Will keep looking for bibs - perhaps need to bite the bullet and buy from a ski shop!
2,You must buy CardioChek analyser first $100,"Call me stupid but I thought these strips acted alone. You have to buy the CardioChek analyser first about $100.It does not say in any of the reviews that you need it. I just wanted a cheap way to test my cholesterol occasionaly, without going to a doctor.For this price I may as well go to the doctor and pay my copay twice a year and get a complete blood work up.The strips probably work fine, but I'm sending them back in any case."
3,Interesting,"I thought this book was really worth reading. It talks about how this young teenage boy Jareth, was in a gang and always did really bad things. He always got into trouble all the time. So his parents decide to fly him to his grandmother's house. There Jareth had learned discipline. His grandmother made him do community service, and take counceling. Overall I think if anyone reads this book even if they aren't thinking of doing anything bad that they will think twice about what they would do!"
4,storyteller,"Even though I'm very Irish I enjoyed the Italian recipes and heritage. Rosa Capoletti and Alex Montgomery had been childhood summer friends. From two different worlds, his rich and hers not. One summer he didn't return to Winslow and she never knew why. One day he does return and through flashbacks she learns more about his life. As Rosa plans her best friends wedding she and Alex become closer, a little at a time. When she catches the bridal bouquet at Linda's wedding, she sees the possibility in Alex's eyes. A great summer, beach book. A sweet romance. Easy and nice."
4,Perfect Summer Beach Read,Summer By The Sea is the perfect book to read when you just want to get lost in a good story. In Susan Wiggs new book we meet Rosa Capoletti and Alexander Montgomery. Once childhood first loves until Alexander suddenly walks out of Rosas life at the time when she needed him most. Now 12 years later Alexander comes back to town after his mothers death to pick up where he left off with Rosa but Rosa is just not having him.Summer By The Sea is a sweet book that makes you believe in happy endings and first true loves. Enjoy!
5,This is my second time reading this book,"I loved the book so much I had to read it again. I also love Just Breathe, Table For Five...any Susan Wiggs book!"
2,A Summer by the Sea,"I have to say that I disagree with every review posted here. This book is not wonderful, but it is not awful either. It falls somewhere in the middle. Just okay. The beginning of the story where Rosa (heroine) is watching her friend Jason propose to her other friend Linda is hoaky and awkward. The middle of the book, where Wiggs describes the childhood relationship between Rosa (heroine) and Alex (hero) was the best part of the book. Then the reunion when they are adults seems predictable and boring. And the accident mystery I had solved chapters before Wigg's intended. Too predictable, and much of the writng was cliche and corney for me. Grade C-"
3,What Friends Are For,"This movie is ok,but I think Dana Hill Played a better role.So did Melora Hardin.If any one has a copy of 'What friends Are for' afterschool special with Dana Hill,let me know.Want to buy it.thanks"
4,"same title, two vastly dffrnt movies","Be sure to email seller concerning which movie you are purchasing. One is a TV production, a family oriented production, and the other is an adult fare, XXX. Amazon shows the XXX."
4,"The R package ""ggplot2""","This book is closely related with the upcoming new book ""ggplot2"" by Hadley Wickham. ""ggplot2"" is an R package for producing elegant graphics based on the Grammar of Graphics."
4,Good outside speaker,"I bought these to replace a set of almost the exact same speakers from Dual that I had been using year-round on the outside of my garage for about 15 years. One of the old ones started buzzing when the temperature got over 90 degrees outside, so I figured it was about time for new ones. the replacements sound great. The ability to turn them on their brackets is a nice feature. I turn mine periodically depending on what part of the yard we need music. You really can't go wrong for the price."
5,Dual 3-Way Speakers,"These are my second set of these speakers in the last two months...I liked the first pair so much that I went ahead and bought a second set for the pool side of my house.For the price, these are a very nice set of speakers....work well, sound good, and are easy to install..."
4,Happy with purchase,"Work good on large deck and can be heard well in large yard. Good price for low priced speakers. Not going to rock your world, plenty of volume before distortion. Happy I chose the 100 watt version anything less may not have been sutable. speakers a little toney but sound overall better then expected for price."
3,Too cheap to be true,"At this price, under forty, I was just hoping I would get the Dual 5.25 speakers. But I suspected that they would be 4 in., and they were. Still they sound OK on my deck. No complaints, really, just be aware that these are mis-marked."
4,Speakers are clear,"The speakers sound good but I attached an amp and with the bass, they begin to rattle. It's ok because they are not sub-woofer. Overall, they work well."
5,Perfect :-),"What can I say? I just ordered my second pair of these for our back patio. My first set, I placed in our den as the front speakers for our projector set-up. Beautiful sound for TV/movies (additional sub for bass) and for outdoor use. Yes, they are not 800 dollar bose speakers, but I can tell you there is NO cheap sound coming from these beauties :-) Super fast shipping, they look great and sound great too. Don't balk on these, they are the real deal."
4,Dual Speakers,"Can't complain for the money. I paired these with the little pyle waterproof amp. The amp isn't that loud, but I hooked the speakers to my indoor stereo and they sounded pretty decent. They're on my boat now, and sound fine."
4,speakers,Sound great and easy to mount out side and out of way. I mounted them outside so I can listen to the radio without turning up the volume on the inside.
2,Speaker covers rusted in four months,"I bought these speakers about six months ago and installed them outside on my deck under an eave. Within four months the screens covering the speakers were completely rusted. The low price was a factor in the purchase, but I anticipated that any shortcomings would be related to sound quality, not rusting of a product rated for outside installation. The sound quality wasnt great but it was adequate given the price"
4,Decent Sounding,"Was looking locally for small durable speakers. Not any, at this price, could be found. I hooked them up and they sound pretty good. I liked looking at the Amazon reviews before buying."
1,"Up until then, they sounded good",Speakers blew after about two hours of listening at moderate volume. Returned them for a full refund and purchased a different set. Customer service was painless. Amazon rules!
4,"Very good, especially for the price","Reading the various reviews about these speakers I was afraid that they would be much worse than the Radio Shack speakers that they look like.For my purposes, however -definitely NOT high end hifi - they do the job very well, and even have surprisingly good bass response. I have no regrets about buying them."
3,Not bad for the price,"Purchased a pair for an ice-fishing shanty. They worked well and sounded pretty good, so I bought a second pair two months later for outside my house (deck). They don't have much bass, but actually sound pretty clear at higher volume. I'd recommend driving them with a nice receiver."
5,Outdoor speakers,"Excellent quality, excellent sound and clarity.Mounting them is a no brainer which is good because the instructions are lame and they give you extra parts? for which they have no instructions or suggestions at all.Typical Chinese approach to marketing. Build a good product, butcher the english translation and assume the buyer will figure it out. Almost called the importer/distributor since they are in my area but figured they probably don't give a hoot anyway."
4,ok for the $,"Not bad speakers for the $, could use alittle more Bass response.Previously had very expensive $$$, ""B*S*""units and lost them due to the weatherCustomer service & warranty did not cover me for anything other than, ""was there anything else I can do for you sir"". . .Yes there is, say goodbye to my little friend."
3,Cheap parts but sound is fine,"I bought these for my outside patio in a track house environment (small yard). For $30 they sound decent. You won't be blown away or anything but if your goal is to have music on in the background for birthday/cocktail parties, these will do the trick. Easy to mount on the house and set up. The parts are cheap though... I ran 14 gauge wire to these since they were more than 50 ft away from my receiver and both black speaker connecters popped out of place when I pushed them all the way down to fit the 14 gauge speaker wire. They are easy to pop back in place and if you use 16-18 gauge wire, you might not even have this issue. Overall, a decent speaker for a good price."
3,Decent speakers,The speakers sound good for the price. I use them in my office so they are not played very loud. My only complaint is that they did not include the screws to mount the speakers to the brackets. I had to make a trip to the hardware store with one of the speakers to buy four screws that cost a total of 96 cents.
4,Excellent Value for the Quality of the Sound,"Speaker's sound fantastic, whether turned down low or up high. Easy to Mount, only problem was they didn't send the thumbnail screw's with it and one of the nut's broke loose like you have read in other reviews if you try to tighten too much.Overall very happy with the sound Quality in relationship to the price!"
5,Great product for cost,This product was successful and easily installed. I went into buying this product with little confidence and it turned out to be a great product. They put out a nice sound for the money and mounted with ease. I am extremely satisfied and would without doubt give this product an outstanding review and recommendation if you would be in the market for outdoor speakers.
4,very durable,you wont beat these for the price and sound quality. been using these for over 4 yrs.they still look & sound great. i have 1 pair in my garage and 1 pair by our hot tub. both are ou tside BUT are undercover.
4,Great speaker for the price range.,"If you're looking for high end great quality speakers these aren't the ones you want. But, if you just want an outdoor speaker that'll do the job at a great price you might consider these. I installed them in my gazebo for background music during parties and get together's and they sound just fine and look great. Easy install with included brackets and typical red/black push in wire connectors."
5,"Fantastic outdoor speakers. Easy to position, small enough to hide and the sound like some speakers three times their size.","This is for the Dual LU43PB Indoor/Outdoor SpeakersThe speakers are just the thing for me. I am using them as we speak in my backyard. They are great and work fantastic.They meet all my expectations. I will be tying them to my Stereo AM FM system, my laptop and my Ham Radio for listening to outside.I will be able to watch movies and use the speakers for audio."
2,poor sound quality,I don't see how anyone thinks these speakers sound good at all. Just brought them home and hooked them up. The sound coming out is tinny and weak. They are going back to store tomorrow.
1,NOT an outdoor speaker,"I bought four of these to replace Dual speakers on a boat. No one was sure how old the previous speakers were they had lasted so long. These new speakers were completely different. The grills started rusting within 2 weeks and are now half covered with rust (very unsightly), the mounting brackets were so flimsy they droop from the weight of the speakers and will not hold the speakers in the position you want them to point. These speakers will have to be trashed. Whatever the previous history of Dual, these are just cheap Chinese POS."
1,waste of money,Remember being a kid and connecting two McDonald's cooky boxes by a string and using them as walky-talkies...? If so then know that these speakers sound worse than that!
1,Voice only quality,"Don't expect high fidelity. These speakers have no bass and high distortion. About what you'd expect at this price. Bummed..., but too cheap to bother returning them. They'd be good for an outdoor voice intercom."
3,Needs Improvement,These three way speakers are very weak and easily over powered by your center channel speaker. Spend the extra money and go with the Yamaha three way bookshelf speakers.
1,Save your money,"Poor quality, poor sound, just cheap junk overall.The pictures look good, but it is all just window dressing. I have heard better sound out of 5 dollar radios.No way are these 100 watt speakers, 3 watt maybe."
1,they stink,"they literally stink. I opened the box and I was blown away from a toxic smelling chemical smell coming from all over the product.I feltill all day.be careful with these , id avoid them, its not worth letting them make you sick.(i buy alot of stuff, and about 2% of the stuff has a similar noxious smell, I think its always the stuff thats made in china.)"
1,For outdoor,Good speakers for outdoor and for the price you cannot go wrong. They sound great and can be installed anywhere with assembly in the shipping
1,Duds,"I put these up under a COVERED porch, used high grade speaker wire, and they sounded good -- for about two weeks. After that, they hiccupped their way through every song. Stay away."
4,question,i just wanted to know how tall are the speakers where because from the look of the pictures they look really small
1,Horrible even for $30 speakers,"After having them plugged in for 5 minutes I have decided to return them. Even at a normal listening level the speakers pop and hiss. I thought I could cheap out on a pair of speakers for outdoor use, but these can't handle even a little bit of power."
1,Tweeter blew out after two uses (on low)!,Update !!After two uses the tweeter blew out! (CHEAP JUNK)! I put these out on my deck and they sound great! They are not weather proof( only weather resistant)so I put plastic bags over them with a big rubber band if the weather is getting bad! they have a 1 year warranty too! a great buy!!
1,"Hey, Amazon...!","Pull this page off.Your descrition is for a ""5-1/2 inch"" outdoor speaker by Dual. The specs say ""4"" woofer...""Wake up! For $35 you get the LU42 (4"" woofer, outdoor speaker, very tinny and not so impressive) by Dual - on sale at Circuit City for $25, by the way. The LU53 (5-1/2"" woofer, outdoor speaker, very nice sounding for so cheap) by Dual is at Circuit City for $59.00, and Amazon has it for $69.00. Take a drive.Watch out for this one - bad info here..."
4,so cheap yet so good!,"I am quite impressed by these speakers. I put them in my bathroom so I can listen to music while in the shower. The sound quality is not top notch by any means but for set of low end outdoor speakers, they do the job great. I find the treble to be on the tinny side but surprisingly they actually produce a decent amount of bass. The construction quality seems excellent except for the speaker wire terminals which are definitely flimsy. These speakers are sufficient such that I would never bother spending $100 or more for outdoor Polks or Yamahas when you could have these for a fraction of the price. I would not however, use these for an indoor surround sound set up, as some reviewers have suggested doing."
3,good for price,Sound was not as loud as I hoped for but the price is right....if the speakers are not covered by a awning or under a patio... they do rust and discolor within a year....
4,Decent sound--Excellent price,"I am a bit of a sound snob. I know good speakers and these are not excellent. However, I purchased these to mount outside permanently and not worry about them. For the price, they are awesome. Who wants to pay a bunch of money for a set of speakers that are going to sit outside? If these mess up after a year of weather, loud parties, and abuse...eh... I'll just buy another set.Don't get me wrong though, for outside waterproof speakers they sound ok. Bass is lacking but they only handle down to 100hz so thats to be expected. They are pretty clear but can have a somewhat shallow and twanging sound. However, they are fairly lightweight (good for mounting on the side of house or under the eaves) and the mounting versatility is also pretty good.I would recommend them if you want some cheap but not cheap sounding outdoor speakers."
4,Perfect for out by the pool,Sound good and all weather perfect for out by our pool. have them hooked up through a wireless system to our Onkyo TXSR608 and they sound great.
2,missing parts,"product receive missing mounting brachet screws, call company was told to e mail proof of purchase which i did never received the missing parts will never deal with them again"
2,You get what you pay for,Sound ok ok they out side and work well no problems with them working. They don't play well loud but they not high end speakers. I would buy again no regrets
1,Not so.....Loud Speakers,"I was very unimpressed with these speakers. I was simply looking for a decent pair of speakers to put on my patio with an old low power tuner. With the loudness setting off and the Bass BELOW the center mark, the speakers rattle as if I were playing them for a party.I would not reccomend the purchase of these speakers to anyone who actually enjoys even decent quality sound."
1,Very very bad,They worked for about two hours and then one went out. The next day both had gone out. Very bad speakers
2,Very poor speakers,Bought these to play music for my Christmas outdoor display and they can't event handle 10 watts of music without sounding like they were blown. I would not wish these on my worst enemy. They are a total waste of money.
5,Great sound! Great quality!,Built very sturdily and put out a great amount of sound for their size! Do not be fooled This is a great deal!
5,Excellent sound,Amazingly good sound for the size and price.I tested them using an aiwa amplifier and the sound was almost as good as with the original aiwa speakers.I promptly hung them under my patio cover using 12 AWG wire and was very pleased with the sound quality and volume.I plan to buy a second set.
4,great buy for the price.,"I bought these as a gift for my brother in-law and we were both really satisfied with the sound, You really cant beat them for the price."
4,Great Value,I got these speakers to replace an old pair on my boat. Boat duty is rough on speakers. The installation was easy. Good hardware and terminals. The speakers are made to stand on their end or be hung from metal brackets. I used the brackets and found the thumb nuts to firmly lock the speakers in position. The sound output is good. Being on the water high back ground noise requires you to drive your speakers pretty hard. Bass is a little light.All to be seen is how well they stand up to the elements.
5,Great Speakers from Amazon.com,"These are my second pair. I have one set in my yard under a tree that's been outside over two years and they are just as good as when i received them.this pair I put on my deck. The sound is great for such an inexpensive product.I also have 2 sets of Bose speakers outside by the pool - I take them in during the winter because of the price, but the duals' sound is quite comparable; but I am not an audiophile!"
4,Great Sound - AMAZING PRICE! - Slow Rust,"These speakers were purchased for an outdoor patio installation and I couldn't be happier with them. They are solidly built and simple to install. These speakers produce great sound for a really small cost!UPDATE 6-16-2011I have had these speakers installed outdoors for a year and have noted a small amount of rust developing on the metal speaker covers. Not exactly sure what I am going to do once more rust develops but it is manageable for now. Also, the bracket clamps do not hold the weight of the speakers in position and the speakers tend to droop downward not long after you tighten them."
2,"Good Company, Mis-Marked Item","Speakers are ok, Dual is a good company.BUT, a little irritated because they are listed as 5 1/4"" but are really the 4"" set. Not just the size of the woofer too but, obviously, the wattage is lower. Expected better from Amazon."
2,When cheap becomes expensive...,"I bought this pair of speakers a little over a month ago. Indoor they work O.K. (they have a ""decent"" sound, I suppose), but when I took them outdoors, apart from having a mediocre sound, they died after 3 hours of playing music, and they weren't even connected to a powerful receiver. If you are like me and you want to save money on some cheap-good quality speakers, these are not the ones you're looking for: they are cheap, but in no way are they of good quality. After all, if they were, wouldn't they have lasted more than 1 month (or 4 hours in an outdoor setting)? Don't make the same mistake I made: spend a little more money and get something with a much better quality, which will surely last more than 40 days."
4,great outdoor speakers for the price.,I purchased these outdoor speakers to match the pair I already have so that I would have four speakers total in my back patio. They complement my speakers and were easy to install. The price was right for this type of speaker. I would recommend these speakers to anyone who wants great sound at low to medium volumes. High volume seemed alittle distorted. It could be the receiver thats not adequate for high volume.
5,What a Bargain for a Great Product!!,"I figured that these would at least be half decent speakers for the money....even ordered a subwoofer to ensure that my deck would have decent bass. But these speakers were a very pleasant surprise!! They look as good as they work and I could not be happier!! In fact, I'm tempted to cancel the subwoofer since they sound so good!Ed"
3,Good for price,"Ordered these to mount on our porch so we could have music while entertaining. Easy installation quick hook up. Overall sound is pretty good, strains a little with heavybass. But for the price good set of speakers. Insanely fast delivery, ordered 7 pm, received them the next morning!"
5,Wonderful line of toys!,The quality of Schleich cannot be beat! Handpainted to look life like and very durable. The Schleich line is my daughter's favorite thing to play with. It is great to see her interact with other kids as well as imaginitive solo play with the toys in the world of technical toys. Love them!
3,Cheap plastic for mounting flag breaks easily,"The pole and hardware to mount the pole onto a building are fine. However, the loops to hold the flag and ""spin"" are made from a very cheap plastic and break easily. Expect to have to find an alternative way to keep the flag properly mounted on the pole."
5,EXCELLANT,"This flag pole arrived quickley and we are very pleased with the product. It looks beautiful. Wish there would have been instructions, but we quickley put it together and it is the best."
5,Excellent Product,"I've been using this for about a month now, and am very pleased with the quality and the workmanship. This product works as advertised - haven't had any tangles yet, even with some fairly heavy winds recently.Bracket is solid and well made, as is the pole itself. I would purchase this again."
4,Good read,"This book is a really good read, I really don't like to talk about details in a book, I don't want to give away anything. I have bought this book for a couple of my girlfriends."
3,I don't know,"Hustlers was kind of boring in most chapters I was kept getting lost. I tried forcing myself to read it but I couldn't do it anymore don't know why I wasted my money on this book. Some of the words was confusing. It seems kind of like Zora's Neal Hurston book ""Their Eyes Was Watching God."" how the words is broken down into ebonics. If any book that tries to out top HOODLUM can just forget about it....!!!!"
1,1/2 STAR....1 star too generous!,"Had I known that this novel was by the same ""crew"" that did the waste of paper called ""Crunk"" I never would have gotten it!! This novel ""Hustlers"" was awful, I could not even finish it! Ronald and Quincy are actually the first names of the 2 authors, I thought it was one person. I don't mean to throw salt, but some of these Black Pearl books are really wack!!I recommend ""Hoodlum"" by K'wan for some real Hustlin'!!"
4,Very Good Read,This book was good to read. It's just like other urban books that keep you wanting to read more. It keeps you interested.
2,DONT LIE TO YOUR SELF,THIS BOOK WAS PAST GHETTO THE MISTAKES WAS CRAZY THE STORY LINE COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR THE TITLE WHO EVER SAID THIS IS THE BST BOOK THEY EVER READ THIS MUST BE THE FIRST I LIKE THE WAY IT SET OUT BUT IT WASNT STRONG ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THE NAME THAT WA A WASTE OF A TITLE
4,An excellent tool for the Bible student or teacher,"Not exactly a commentary, but much more than just an outline. I have found this book to be an excellent resource to learn the structure and meaning of Paul's letter to Rome. The authors included many useful and extensive notes, charts, and appendixes related to major doctrines in the letter. Appendix D contrasts the teachings of Calvinism and Arminianism and was published as a separate work by the same publishing company. The book has a Preface written by Gordon H. Clark."
3,Intresting read but not fact filled as author claims.,"This book is a little bit more accurate than ""Blue Thunder"" but it is still not all true, nevertheless it is still a good read. I have been in the boat business in south florida for many years and know most of the key figures in the book, therefore I can tell you Mr. Harris's motive for Aronow's death is not accurate. Aronow's killer was never caught."
3,Chrome Steel Extra Depth Transmission Pan,"This part was ordered for a 2003 Jeep G.C.Ltd.4.7 HO.The application chart said it would fit my vehicle,however that was not the true. What may of happened issome modle years had two different transmissions.The only good thing about this process was that it waseasy to return."
3,"One key point, but without an adequate research base","This book tackles a crucial subject - how do we teach reading to a population that has not learned to read in the past? Emphasizing the selection of content of interest to young black men, the author makes a number of strong points about how to engage them. However, he doesn't supply well constructed research findings to support his argument."
2,croscill chambord comforter,im very dissapointed in the quality of such an expensive product..I always said you get what you pay for and the quality of this particular set i bought is horrible.I expected the blanket to be much thicker and more comfortable than what it is..its very flat and the bedskirt looks like it would rip very easily if pulled the wrong way..not to mention the color bedskirt i was sent was not what was in the description.
5,Comforter,I have had my eye on this comforter set for years. Surprising it was still around but the only thing that held me back was it was dry clean only. I am so glad I decided to buy it I am very pleased with it and received it very quickly.
2,Caveat Emptor,"Just a note to potential buyers: If you are looking for a full Latin-language version of the Confessions, this is not it. Jungers' book is a sort of poetic meditation on Augustine, with Latin quotes thrown in. Lovely for what it is, but not at all what the title might imply."
2,Doesn't do the job - bought it in July 2009 from Amazon.,"Unfortunately I was sick and didn't use this within the time frame to have been able to return it. I installed all 8 AA batteries, waited till the dark of night & turned it on. Well, there was the definite odor of urine but it did not show the yellow color using the light that one is supposed to see. I finally went to a pee pad in another room that I knew had urine on it and after careful inspection could just barely make out an extremely dull yellow in that area. It was a waste of money and I feel foolish having bought it, let alone not have been able to use it earlier when I could have at least returned it. BTW, there are 3 dogs and 2 male cats which is why I bought the darn thing to begin with. I used to have another urine spotter years ago that was less expensive and you could clearly see the yellow areas on rugs and furniture. For me this was a most disappointing product."
5,Wonderful,I'm sure glad my owner found this ultraviolet urine detector. This light worked really great on detecting the urine in our carpet. The light shows a large enough area. If you have never used one before make sure the area/room is dark for the urine spots to show up. I highly recomend this ultraviolet urine detector for any pet or child/adult.
3,It Works But Requires Some Skill to Use,"This product does work - but it also requires some skill to use. Stains won't simply jump out at you as seen in some pictures - you need to really go slow and look hard to see the difference in colors. What helps is to calibrate your eyes using a known stain and you will see the difference in coloring - a more neon yellow/green amongst the bright reflection of the carpet color. And this shading can be more subtle than depicted depending on the color of the carpeting. Our beige flecked shag berber made it quite challenging though workable. Definitely use this product in a pitch black room. Also keep in mind this product will show other types of biological stains as well - not all are urine - so hate to say this - use your good old nose to confirm!! Oh and one other tip, take something with you to mark the stain(s), as it can be quite a challenge to find the stain again once the lights come back on!"
4,Didn't work-update-the replacement works,"I was fostering a dog that started marking in my house. The dog is not longer with me but the smell is and I can't find the area. I sent for this and got it today. I put in batteries and turned it on...nothing. Took the batteries out and put them in again...nothing. Wacked it on the side like a previous reviewer...nothing. Plugged in a DC converter...nothing. I am sending it back for a replacement. If that doesn't work, I will get a different kind. I am so disappointed.OK, got my replacement and it does work. I couldn't find any spots so I must have gotten it all when I cleaned the one I knew of but I am glad that I have this in case the cats have an accident."
2,It works but build quality is quite bad,"On the positive side this product works. The light is powerful enough to do its job. On the negative side, the build quality is utterly horrendous. It is very poorly built. Once should be afraid of breaking it by merely touching it or using it as if it were built of the most easy to shatter crystal."
1,Inferior,I previously purchased a similar product (which I lost) at Petsmart. This one is quite inferior to my previous purchase. Do not buy.
1,fizzle,"received it a few days ago and it looked cheap. didn't try it out until tonight after i went to the store to buy more batteries (8AA, surprising). i tried it out and it worked for a few seconds then flickered and a little trail of smoke rose up from it. Doesn't seem to work now. That was disappointing and i was expecting a little more for the price. i'm guessing someone soldering the wiring had an off day and QC was probably lacking or non-existant."
1,worthless,"After three years I was curious as to why I NEVER spotted any cat pee with this thing...I found out why after shining it on fresh cat pee on a carpet, IT DOESN'T WORK!If you want a cool blacklight, this is fine, if you think you'll get all kitty CSI and stuff, forgetaboutit!"
1,No! Bad dog!,Cheap....not working straight from the box....8 batteries ....can't tell if it uses up battery life because IT WON'T EVEN TURN ON...makes me hate myself for getting suckered...(u get the idea I hope)
2,not easy to use if you are stiff in the knees,This light requires you to be right down on the floor. I'm too old for that. I think that another design would be easier to use.
1,would not work for us,we tried this and were not able to get it to illuminate urine..even when we caught our cat in the act...
2,"Not a strong UV light, not particularly useful","Light shows only when completely dark. Not necessary urine stains, mainly anything white will glow. So white residue from water stains will glow also. Not very useful."
1,disappointed,"In spite of positive reviews, which I always check before buying, this thing did not live up to its claim. Although it uses 8 AA batteries, the light is extremely dim and almost impossible to see if you are also trying to hold the light. Although the carpet was clearly pet stained on the backing, and smelled bad, the detector did not show anything different from any place else. I was hoping from something a little more definitive, so have to say this did not work for me. The plastic casing was also extremely flimsy."
4,"Good product, would recomend","This light worked great, I had bought another cheap light after Halloween a few years ago for this purpose but was never happy. This light does all you expect. It does take a lot of batteries and is somewhat clumsy to hold. I would still recommend it to others with pee proplem areas."
3,Alternative,"Suggest going to Home Depot and getting a standard lightbulb UV light such as the Philips Party & Deco Blacklight A19 75 Watt. Costs less than $4.00 and screws into any light fixture - something with a reflector works best and protects your eyes. I'm guessing it works better than something battery powered. Still it's necessary to get close - 12"" - 24"". The spots seem to show pretty clearly."
4,Very pleased with this,"I bought this to help me identify areas that my house broken resistant dog might have done his thing. It works great for this. It is not perfect. I need to turn the lights out and get fairly close to what I am looking at but then any urine stains glow like crazy. If you read the reviews, none of these are perfect. Most people seems to love the one they bought but some hate the very same one with a passion. Because of this, I bought this one locally so I could easily return if if I hated it. No need for that. I am very pleased with it. It does take a boat load (8) of AA batteries, so that could be better. Still I am pleased!"
2,"Badly constructed, but works","We can definitely use this item to locate otherwise-invisible traces of cat urine but the bulb fits into the plastic sheath really badly, it's very loose. I have to basically hold the bulb in place manually in order to complete the circuit & get power to the light. So it's awkward to use!"
1,Completely Ineffective,Even after knowing exactly where my cat uninated this product did not even faintly illuminate the stain. I can't understand the other reviewers of this item giving this product anything but a big zero. I sent it back promptly for a refund. I hate a ripoff. I would have given it a minus 5 if that had been possible. I irks me even to give it one star
1,Doesn't work,"My cat has urinated in one area so much that I can smell the stench as soon as I walk into the room. In an effort to remove all of the urine at one time, in hopes that she wouldn't re-mark the same spot, I purchased this light. It showed zero urine stains. I have wood floors, and upholstered furniture, and stains showed nowhere in the very stinky room. It was completely worthless. I'm taking it back."
3,not clutz proof,Does the black light find the spray? Absolutely! Is this light worth the cost? Absolutely not! The casing is very cheap plastic and the battery cover has barely-there plastic tabs to keep it in place. This light lasted exactly 5 minutes in my husband's hands. The light fell out of the casing( there's no cover over it) and shattered on the floor.
2,Awesome...ly bad,"This item did exactly what I wanted it to. I was looking for a UV light that would work for a few days, then spill battery acid and become inoperable, thus wasting my money and the many batteries it requires to operate. An added feature I enjoyed was the door to where they batteries are inserted. It doesn't close correctly, and gives you the opportunity to use the tape of your choice to keep it shut. I used electrical tape! Such joy."
1,WARNING - CHEAPLY MADE!,"The product didn't work right out of the box. When I finally got the light to work - kept turning off on it's own - it didn't even shine enough black light on the carpeting to show me where a possible ""accident"" might be. I put the light right over a spot where I was sure an ""accident"" was and nothing, nadda, zippo. Total waste of money! Do not purchase!"
1,Do Not Purchase,This item did not work once the batteries were installed but the overall quality was so poor that it was really no shock that it didn't actually work. Very cheap plastic and would probably break quickly even if it had actually turned on.
2,doesn't work on dark carpet,"We have very dark maroon-colored carpets throughout our entire upstairs and I found an area our new cat urinated on in an upstairs bedroom. I bought this to see if there were other spots he used in that room since I haven't been able to get the smell out. Nothing except lint shows up on this color carpet. I did find a lot of splatter-looking things on the walls, but I had to crawl around and actually sniff the entire carpets upstairs to see if he had used other spots, which is what I was trying to avoid in the first place. Downstairs where we have lighter carpets it did light up in the one area I know he used down there and had already treated, and it is kind of fun to use--you almost feel like a forensic detective (I was horrified at our toilet). But overall it wasn't very helpful to me."
1,Don't waste your money,"My dog is getting older and she is losing control of her bladder. I got this light to try to find out where she has been leaking so I could clean up after her. I checked around where she always lays down.......nothing showed up. One day she got up and wanted to go out. I patted her rump and it was wet. I grabbed the light and ran it over her backside and......NOTHING. It did not fluorese as it was supposed to. I checked the place that she just got up. The carpet was wet. Shone the light on the area.......NOTHING! I know it was her urine, it smelled like her urine but this light did nothing. Don't waste your money on this item. It MAY have worked for other people(???) but not for me. Take your chances folks!"
3,Not as powerful,"Not as powerful as I was hoping for. I can see some things, but know that I am missing others spots."
2,Just a standard blacklight it seems,"Don't think there's anything special about this, just a blacklight, which sort of works to spot urine, though you have to get pretty close to see anything."
4,It worked like it supposed to,I was happy with the way the Simple Solution Spot Spotter Ultraviolet Urine Detector helped me locate my cat's urine spots so I could attempt to clean them up. It is important you read the package and understand what all the different colors/lights mean when looking at them with this detector. I had know problem with finding what I needed once I understood how the ultraviolet urine dector worked. I would recommed this product.
5,Does Exactly What It Should,"My older dog was having accidents in the house but I was having trouble finding them. My carpet must be the SAME color as dog pee because the only time I would 'find' the accident is if I stepped in it! Yikes! After reading the reviews, I purchased the Simple Solution Spot Spotter and went to work. Yeah - it takes 8 batteries - whatever. You're shopping on Amazon so just get a box. Be sure you read the back of the Spot Spotter box as it describes what pee stains look like versus things like detergent, etc. Oh lord. I was mortified. Be sure the room is dark and take a pad of Post it Notes with you to mark the pee spots(uh...you can get those on Amazon too). It was easy to see that I had overlooked a few spots that my dog baptized. Because misery loves company I'm going to lend it out to friends and neighbors so they can experience the horror in their own homes. Enjoy!"
1,Doesn't work,"I've been trying to find cat urine (I know she's leaking), but this morning I gave up after I shined it on a WET SPOT on the bed in a PITCH-DARK room and saw nothing. Sending it back...after I take out the 8 batteries."
1,Don't buy this,"I was really disappointed with this light. Not only does it take A LOT of batteries, but the actual light was very dim, and I couldn't see anything--even in a pitch dark bathroom. I've bought smaller lights that work better. This was very disappointing. Don't bother buying it."
4,Worked for Cat Urine,We have not used the urine detector a lot but it definitely detects cat urine. It does light up other things too but most everything can be differentiated from cat urine by the color. My only complaint is the number of batteries it requires.
4,It certainly works!,"I'd purchased another, cheaper blacklight ""stain detector"" from American Science and Surplus and it was completely useless. I guess you get what you pay for. I took a chance on this one - it's not all that expensive, either - and I'm so relieved (and disgusted) that it works very well!NOTE: It is quite jarring to discover the glowing evidence of formerly invisible spills, splashes, and deliberate markings.My son was so alarmed at all the drips and spots that fluoresced that he ran to put his slippers on! Clearly, many of the spots were from non-cat substances (bleach and detergent dribbles along the side of the washer, an old coffee spill on the office chair), but I feel confident that I can attack and eliminate all the offensive spots now that I've found them. Buy one for your pet-loving friends, too."
4,Works great - but best to use at night (or in a darkened room),"This is great for pinpointing those hard-to-find smelly spots that your pet has left behind. Only thing is you have to use it in a really dark room, otherwise the spots wont show up well.Another thing you'll want to know is that it's a battery hog (it uses 8 batteries!!). However, if you have a 12V DC adapter you can use that instead."
2,Not all I thought it would be.,"The detector was simple enough to use, although it required alot of batteries(8). But the results were mixed. Urine markings were faint and hard to distinguish from other organic substances. Even in areas where I knew there had been an accident, it was difficult to spot the difference. All in all, I generally wouldn't recommend this. (Although it did clearly show a distressing amount of what I believe is mold in the bathroom.)"
5,splatter spotter!,"This product works very well.....too well! My house was aglow! Fortunately, we found the fine print that said that not only would cat urine show up, but cleaning agents as well. It then goes on to explain the different colors. I was able to get a couple of urine cleaning products and went to town cleaning my walls. Now my house is still ""aglow"", but it smells great and the ""splatter lights"" are from cleaning agents rather than Fluffy."
5,Wow! This works well!,"First we tried a flashlight-style UV light which barely disclosed anything. THEN we used this UV fluorescent-type light. It was so thorough at showing where our puppy had gone that it was SCARY! It even showed where we had splashed some aquarium water on the carpet. This light left no boo-boo undisclosed, and we were able to treat ALL needed areas with the OUT! enzymatic cleaner. Perfect solution - no stains & no odor."
3,Works okay.,"It does light up a lot of spots on the carpet that are not animal urine, but had a tought time finding the cat urine. Urine was more visible on smoother surfaces than carpet."
1,Go outside before inserting btteries.,"Wow. Put the 8 AA batteries in, and the light doesn't come on when I hit the ON switch. Flipped it off and back on, smoke pours from the end of it. I run it outside into the dark night, and it is glowing red on the wiring. I guess you get what you pay for. Oh, and it burnt the end of my finger, too."
3,Not what i expected,"This DVD was not what I was expecting. It moves quite fast and is difficult to follow. It did not do well in terms of holding my attention, so I did not even make it through the whole thing. It should be noted that I downloaded this to my Tivo through Amazon."
4,great canadian parks,An excelleny commentary and photographic account of some of the worlds most beautiful and under rated country. An excellent tool for preparing to visit our national parks and/or a wonderful keepsake of unforgetable journeys.
2,NO TRACK LISTINGS,"I haven't bought this CD, so I can't speak for the quality, music or packaging - BUT - the reason for this review is that there are NO tracks listed for this instrumental favorites CD. I've been collecting scores and compilations for 60 years and before I purchase anything, I need to know what I'm buying. So, until Amazon starts listing the tracks, no dice."
4,great valentine story,Pauline gets ready for the big Valentine's Day party at school. She make Valentine's Day cards and bake cookies. She has to watch out for her little brother. He's always trying to do the things Pauline does. When Pauline gets to school she can't find her cards. A little while later her mom comes to her school. Her little brother found her lost cards at school. He has saved Valentine's Day for Pauline.The book has flip type pages. Children will love reading the book and seeing what is under the flaps.We would recommed this book to read around Valentine's Day. It's a good holiday book.
5,thermal shirts,thses were just what I was looking for---gave as a gift and it was perfectif you want extra warmth under a different shirt this is the dillies trythem
1,Not really thermal shirts - very thin,The only reason these are called thermal shirts is because they have a 'waffle' like texture that is akin to standard thermal shirts. I bought 2 black ones and they are extremely thin. If you hold them up to the light you can see through them more than a standard fruit of the loom t-shirt.Stick to the Indera Mills thermals if you are looking for any heat retention qualities other than a standard cotton shirt.For those in warmer climates who like the thermal look - well this might be exactly what you're looking for!
3,NOT made in USA,"I bought these shirts because the product description said ""made in USA,"" but the actual package says ""assembled in Mexico of US components."""
2,Essential Apparel Basic Thermal Top - b800ls,This product is VERY thin. I ordered them without knowing just how thin they was. I was not happy with the product and NO I did not send them back due to the fact it is to much to send things back. This is just FYI to anyone ordering these they are PAPER THIN and if you are looking to something thick these are not what you want to order.
2,what's it made of?,How can you expect anyone to buy this product when you don't even tell us what it's made of?
2,Cheap,These shirts are very cheap and will fall apart within a few wears. Invest your money with a company that makes more quality products.
5,Warm,Well made and very warm. I bought this for work in Canada and it kept me warm even in negative temperatures and blowinbg snow.
3,Warm undergarment,"After an initial washing, this thermal shirt lived up to its promise. It does not appear to shrink much on washing in warm water and dryer drying."
5,Best clothing purchase I've made in a while,"A real great price for a great thermal top. Plan to order another set of tops and bottoms soon.... the only (very minor) issue is that the tag is particularly itchy, but its held on by only a few threads and they're easily cut off. Other than that, its really comfortable."
4,"But, how 'new' was it?",I love the pot but its' packaging looked somewhat old. The package also had what appeared to be part of a discounted price tag attaced-the rest was torn off.
4,Elaborate,"Great book! Quite detailed in its technicalities, case studies, examples of TRIZ.Encompasses all things available.Price-could have been a bit economical and hence the 4-star."
3,a great refrence book but too detailed,A great refrence book for triz users who want to complete their theoretical knowledge .Not suitable for beginners who want to gain quick results.
4,Pokemaniac Alert!,"This is a good read and lots of pokemon pictures galore!I think it's a pretty good read and has some fascinating facts in it, a must buy for pokemaniacs, although people who are not fans of pokemon should buy it too, it's really great and you 'll be hooked on before u know it!Gotta Read them all!Trust me, i got hooked straight away!"
4,It has everything EXCEPT about 100 Pokemon!!!,"The Official Pokemon Handbook is an excellent guide to Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow, but if you own Pokemon Gold, Silver, or Crystal, this book is absolutely no help at all. In the Togepi entry, they don't even list its number for crying out loud! Aside from that ... error, this book is nigh flawless. The descriptions are helpful, evolutionary data is critical, and the learned move lists help to determine how to raise your team. All in all, a good buy.-Pokemon Obsessive"
5,need it for the pokemon fan,"I ordered this book for my son who is 4 years old.This has colorful pictures of pokemon with description.If you are a pokemon fan, you need this."
4,POkee not HOkee,"Grandson lost his 1st book and when I saw the great price on Amazon, I jumped at the chance to buy it for his birthday. Other retail stores sold it for much more."
4,Pokemon Handbook Rocks,Bought this for my 8 year old grandson who is a big Pokemon fan. He phoned me to say how much he's enjoying this book.
3,typo,i found a typo on the back.it talks about the well known fact of poliwags and polwhirls swirl directon change.and mistakenly says poliwhirl evolves into poliwag WRONG!!!though some1 should know
3,It's a great book... for beginers,"I think that this book is the greatest... if you are a beginer. Man, after you get to Viridian Forest, it's lost it's worth, unless you want to know what level your Pok√©mon evolves and/or what moves it will get. And it could also give more accurate info, i.e. Machamp can't punch opponents to the moon. That's impossibe. Even a person who knows & understands one iota nonliner math (like me, thanks to Michel Crichton for explaining that in his books, or else I wouldn't sound like a genius to my freinds)can tell you that."
5,The Official Pokemon Handbook,"I recommend this handbook to anyone who likes poke`mon because it has 144 pages of the 151 poke`mon characters including mew. When I first got it I read it all in one day because it was so cool,But I still read it every day since I got it. If you have gameboy with a poke`mon game then this book is for you because it tells about:what element it is and what attacks it does, what its good and bad against and what leavel it Evolves at."
5,My son loves it!,My son who is 8 is getting into Pokemon card collection and into other pokemon stuff. This is on his Christmas wish list and found it for a great price thru' amazon sellers. He says there are lot more details on this Pokemon Handbook than the other ones.
5,best pokemon handbook,"This book tells you all you need to know about the first 151 pokemon,plus togepei.It also tells you how to beat gym leaders and the elite four.If you buy this book,you won't have any regrets."
3,"A good read, but with some mistakes in it.","The really did make some mistakes. But it is an interesting read and as a basic guide to the game. Not as much use as the hand book that comes with the game, if you ask me. But if you are an older person, and you need some basic education on pokemon, this is a perfect read.It goes from 1-150. Or, Bulbasaur to Mewtwo. It even lists the attacks , and shows what and how they evolve! A nice, long book."
3,"As a Pok√©mon master, I say this book is great for beginers","There's a Pok√©mon guide from Versus Books that has better info for people playing the game. But, like I said, this is no guide for a Pok√©mon master. Maybe in a crash course, though."
2,Pokemon Handbook,"The book is nice but I was a little disappointed that it is so old. Many, many of the latest Pokemon are not covered in the book."
1,Parents ALERT.,"This kept my daughter interested for about 2 weeks. Now, into the trash it goes. Don't waste your money. Kids get all their Pokemon info from their friends and the internet. This book wasn't interesting enough to hold her attention and she loves to read."
3,"""Mistakes,"" or lack of interest?","Were the police truly interested in catching the murderer of Candy Short? BURIED MISTAKES, the true-crime account of the slaying of an unrenowned small-town girl, asks that crushing, rhetorical question. Ultimately a hard-working detective, coming out of retirement, reviewed the ""unsolved"" case and proceeded to nab the culprit, the victim's husband. Was it that detective's own family-violence childhood that drove him to catch a wife-beating killer? BURIED MISTAKES author Michael Kaplan seems to ask: Is justice enough cause to motivate us to do the right thing, or must there be a personal stake in the issue?"
5,Total legitimate anger....,"This is an angry CD.Almost all of the lyrics on this CD aredirected at someone. It was recorded in '92 ... There was a lot to be mad about-- and on this disc, it all comes out..... maybe to the point where it is almost.... almost... in self-parody....But it's not. And the anger still resonates, and if this is not remembered as one of THE CDs of the whole 'gangsta' era, it pretty much shows how messed up the world is. I still carry this CD in my car. I still listen to this once a week. In so many ways, it's my favorite rap CD....If you've not heard it, and want to remember/realize how messed up the world is, buy this disc. If you want to have a CD that is dark.... buy this CD.... another disc from the same year that is pretty tight is the 'Menace II Society' soundtrack-- I'd buy that too... and then watch the movie....It's all pretty haunting..."
5,the pride of africa,"this cd reminds me of my childhood back in the 70's, then when i hear it now it still sounds like some old blaxploitation soundtrack.starts off saying about the system of how criminals, and slaves have been killed yes i mean black people and don't think racism is dead cause rappers have crossedover, yes people have been axed, burned alive, buried alive, mutilated, dragged, hung, shot, crucified, raped, drowned, left out in a abandoned area to rot, talks about the last black man who was executed and th e white folks love this, i miss music like this cube need to refocus his views back on these issues. even though jd, t bone, and shorty shines mostly on this cd. lench mob was ahead of their time predicting the rise of the slim shady syndrome."
3,3.5 STARS.........HIT OR MISS FOR ME TOO,"when i heard this album when it first came out, i thought it was gonna be that elevation because of the title cut, but i was wrong. the4 lot of this is subpar at best. however, i do love the muggs remix of AIN'T GOT NO CLASS along with the title cut. ice cube sort of saves this album on certain cuts, but as a whole, i really do not think too much of this album. it is one of those things where they could've done better."
3,"""Suribachi"" pays off big","""In the Shadow of Suribachi"" introduces us to a set of very different people in peacetime, and then allows us to follow them to a battle that was hell on earth. I found Faulkner's storywriting skills powerful, her characters compassionately drawn and believable. An important and well-constructed book."
5,This Twenty-Something Says: READ ME!,"Oh, this book! I was on the fence of whether or not I should order this because it is a man's view of his quarter life crisis, complete with marijuana on the front cover. Which seemed very different than my own at the moment, and I wanted something to relate to. But....it was more than what I expected...entertaining, funny, witty come to mind.I'm reading this during my own quarter-life crisis, and I have to say that this book was a reminder that even though it's fiction, that all twenty-somethings face the same kinds of problems. If you are in your twenties, struggling and just need something to laugh about, this is a great pick me up!I applaud the Ian Hollingshead on a job well done, and I look forward to his next work!"
2,Caution: Review Spam,"Very light reading. As a genre, this British ""lad lit"" is their equivalent of ""Jersey Shore"", but with fewer insights into character. A fast read, but very, very predictable. Also be cautioned about the 5-star reviews on here (and especially on the amazon.co.uk site); it seems they may be friends of either the author or publisher."
3,"Highlights, again...","Just to clear up what others have missed. This compilation is simply a ""highlights"" collection from the YesYears Box set, released in 1991. And it is NOT REMASTERED.While it does provide a nice retrospective of the band, it fails to pull any of the unreleased tracks from the box set, which is now out of print.The Rhino re-issues (with bonus tracks) put this disc and the YesYears box set on the ""obsolete"" list, as most of the unreleased tracks are now on the re-issues. I say most.If you have the YesYears box set, there is no reason to own this."
4,A little bit of everything,"This was my first real introduction to the diversity of Yes. If you start here you can basically pick which era you prefer and go from there. Something's Coming is a great song and is a great extra track. The die-hards go with Fragile, The Yes Album, and Close to the Edge. Those are by far the best. This is a good buy for a casual Yes fan."
4,Too Much Or Not Nearly Enough,"It would be better to buy the single CD Classic Yes or to buy Fragile, Close To The Edge, and Yessongs. The songs are more enjoyable in their original context."
4,Period correct,"Visually, as close to a production that Wagner might have envisioned available among the current releases.Aurally, it gets by because of the experience of the leading ladies. The males also fall somewhat short of ideal but as a whole, it succeeds. 'Rheingold' is the standout."
3,An unexpected switch,"I can hardly review the Levine ""Ring,"" since you sent me something completely different--a set from the Bayreuther Festspiele, conducted by Pierre Boulez. It appears to be in excellent shape, but it is obviously a different product."
2,Had to stop taking this product.,"I've been taking NAC with excellent results for 2 years. After having my gallbladder removed, I found that taking the NAC helped relieve all of the discomfort that remained after the surgery. I had been taking Village Green Apothecary's in-house brand with excellent results. Once I moved away from Maryland, I purchased the Jarrow brand and began to notice horrific heartburn within 45-60 minutes of taking the NAC. I have no idea why this brand is triggering heartburn, but I am certain that it is. I tested this on 5 different occassions to determine that it was, in fact, the Jarrow NAC and not something else. I had to discontinue use. Plus, I did not experience the same beneficial results with the Jarrow brand that I did with the Village Green Apothecary in-house brand. However, my mom did not experience the same negative results that I did, so that's why I give the product 2 stars."
1,5 hp Tecumseh engine snowblower,"This snowblower is woefully underpowered. The 5 hp engine is barely adequate to drive the wheels and the auger. As soon as you try to blow more than a couple inches of snow, it bogs down.I don't think it's coincidence that the company sells an identical blower, except with an 8 hp engine."
5,Amazing and strange music,"Bob Drake is a masterful vocalist, guitarist, drummer and recording engineer. The music on AMC is wildly diverse and full of quirky, entertaining short tunes. As with all of his projects, this one is nothing like the last one, and will likely bear no resemeblance to the next. Bob is one of the true musical masters living today, and I can't praise his musical sensibilities highly enough. His first album, ""What Day Is It?"" is my favorite album of all time, and you can only get it directly from him. You can e-mail him at woof@capmedia.fr to get a copy, and I HIGHLY recommend that you do!"
1,Save your money. Buy condoms instead!,"This is thrash metal garbage not prog rock. Terrible lyrics! These guys are like Styx and Metallica banding together and making music, but not being able to make up their minds what to write about. So they just play long songs with improvised lyrics. Not good at all. If you want good prog listen to Pink Floyd, Yes, Genesis or Marillion.Do not buy Dream Theatre! Buy condoms instead!"
2,"Intresting, but way too much musical indulgence.","Hmmn, a band that combines old school progressive rock like Rush, Kansas, and Yes, and combines metal like Metallica and Queen-something. Queensryche? Yeah, that's their name. Well, anyway, I smell failure.And I sort of did.This album, while it has its moments, failed to impress me. There were too many musicial parts and not enough of the songs. I understand that they're a progreesive rock band, but they need some direction. Ok, Another Day, Surrounded,, Pull Me Under, and Wait For Sleep is good, in fact, great, but the other go on and on until you just want to skip it. Oh well, maybe I got one of the bad albums. I hope next time they'll be good."
5,essential prog-rock,"This is Dream Theater's finest moment, creating complex landscapes of sound with stories to tell along the way...Scenes from a Memory is a perfect complement CD to this, as that one picks up where parts of this one leave off...these guys are some of the most talented musicians in the biz today, and perform all the bits (loud or soft) with an flair of experimentation and professionalism all at the same time...awesome.For those wondering where all the great prog sound (with a few tablespoons of metal) has gone, look no further than this CD!"
5,Excellent Music!,"This was the first Dream Theater CD I bought, and I've bought everything they've done since. (Including the two Liquid Tension Experiments, which are instrumental only) All the musicians are world class. James LeBrie's vocals show that he has a good range and excellent control."
5,A music phenomenon,"wow, what a band. I was listening to Images and Words ever since 92, when it came out, and 7 years after it's release it still always finds a way into my CD player. James LaBrie's vocals are by far the best I've ever heard. Everything from John Myung's bass to John Petrucci's guitar, is just awe inspiring. This CD is a compliment to humanity."
5,Wow... that was amazing,"I got into DT a few years back when my buddy bought Train of Thought. At the time I was a big fan of Metallica and this album kinda reminded me of Metallica back when they used to rock.... only DT's ToT album blows away anything Metallica has ever done or will ever do.So since then I've bought Six Degrees and Metropolis Pt. 2. Both albums were pretty darn good and gave me a good reason to stick around w/ DT. Then today I bought Images an Words... It kicked the **** out of me! This album blew me away! There's not one song on here that I don't like! Anyway... if you're a DT fan, don't hesitate to buy this album! It will rock your freaking world!Also check out James LaBrie's Elements of Persuasion and Mullmuzzler 2...."
5,Probably my favorite album ever...,"Definitely my favorite Dream Theater album... Probably my favorite album by anyone, ever.If you love great drummers and / or cutting edge (for its time) progressive hard rock / metal, you should already have this album. If you don't, buy it right now. Seriously."
5,Artistic and Mind-blowing use of musical expression!!,"I am a huge fan of Dream Theater's!! My favorite song is ""Wait for Sleep"". I absolutly love the piano part and it's soothing sound! Their music is an extremely breath taking, creative, mind-blowing, and wonderful trip to another universe or something!! I have five of their cd's and this is the one I listen to most!!! They are extremely talented musicians, or should I say ""dream makers""."
5,Truly amazing talent and truly amazingly enjoyable,"They are the real deal. The guitar work in the second half of Under a Glass Moon is terrific. There is a lot of great material here, and I'm looking forward to listening to it many times before I truly form an opinion. So far, it is certainly a 5 star album."
4,In Progress,"I think this album was very good but the band was still looking for their refined sound. Pull me under was one that was successful when compared to later albums. I always felt it sounded much like Rush, Queensryche, Pink Floyd, with Kansas and Queen all rolled into a group with a few members of Dream Theater mixed in."
1,Super Group of the 90's? Please.......,"If you are a fan of syrupy ballads by lycra clad hair bands, this is the CD for you. Compare them to the Beatles and Pink Floyd? No way -- the best album of the 90's? I sure hope not -- the intent of the album is good - the music is inspired and the lyrics thoughtful but that is lost when all of the raw power of the band is consumed by the production. What you have left is an over-dubbed over produced product that takes away all of the bands individuality and makes them sound like other generic ""hard-rock"" bands. Do us a favor, plug them into some amps and take away the aural exciters and let us hear them for what they really are - very talented musicians."
1,Beware you may be listening to AC/DC,"I purchased the Images and Words (ATCO 792148-2) CD from CDnow.I got the correct liner notes, the disc is a factory pressing, correct in every way, with 8 tracks of W&I; listed. However, the songs are not the songs of Images and words.Turns out the music pressed onto my disc is the 10 track AC-DC Back in BlackI would suspect this is not the only wrong pressing out there.Interesting! Hold those Reviews, this changes everything!I gave one star to the music on my disc, but 5 stars for the real I&W;Could be why this fine cd has had a few bad reviews?"
1,Buy condoms instead!!!,I read that this was a modern prog band.WRONG!!!!!!!This is a Styx crossed with Metallica contraption. Terrible lyrics. Probably the worse album I have ever heard.Don't buy this. Save your money. Buy condoms instead.
1,Older is NOT better,"Older Dream Theater, and this CD is from 1992, is just not as good. I'm a huge DT fan, especially their more recent stuff, but the old stuff sounds more pop/van halen/over simplified. After listening to the musical masterpiece Metropolis II, which I think is one of the best CD's I've ever heard, Metropolis I was a huge letdown. There were some recurring musical themes between the two, but the first one had down downright 'dinky' parts to it. Progressive rock has come a long way, and Dream Theater is one of the best and brightest stars on the Prog Rock venue... but that doesn't mean their old stuff is any good. Avoid this CD at all costs."
2,Confused,"What an utter disappointment. What the heck does this band think they are doing? They are obviously talented muso's, but really...these would have to be the worst lyrics I have ever heard. In an effort to sound intellectual, they have strung together a bunch totally unrelated phrases, which only succeeds in confusing the listener and making them wonder why they parted with thier hard earnt. Now don't get me wrong and tell me it has all gone over my head, I'm a Rush fan so I'm no stranger to heavy lyrics. Come to think of it, maybe you would be better off listening to some Rush, at least Neil Peart's lyrics make sense and take you to somewhere other than confusion."
3,"Still ""just okay"" after all these years","A couple years ago, I started hearing a lot about this band through word of mouth. I was really into prog-rock and metal when I was younger so I bought Images and Words out of curiosity. The first time I listened to it, I was incredibly disappointed. Songs and vocals sounded cheesy. Instruments were wanky. The thrash metal riffs sounded dated. Over the years, I've listened to the album many times (mostly because I was trying to learn how to play the songs) and while I've grown more accustomed to their sound, I still don't particularly care for this album (or any of DT's other albums). There aren't any songs that I really hate. All of them are okay. I can almost enjoy Pull Me Under. Under a Glass Moon has an exciting, inventive guitar solo. If you're into this sort of thing, you'll probably love this album like all of the other reviewers. If you're not, Images and Words probably won't change your mind."
5,Simply Wonderful!!,"This is the Dream Theater cd that had such much to say. It's got wonderful melodies and texture and truly is a masterpiece. I often wonder or think that perhaps Kevin Moore's departure from DT was something the band has not yet fully recovered from? Awake was heavier, but a lot of the texture was still there. Overall I'd say this is their best cd and is truly a progressive masterpiece. These guys can play and play they do on this effort. This is one cd I never get tired of listening to."
5,Outstanding,I was turned on to this group by friends in College. The best word I can think of to describe them is Amazing.
5,The greatest music to enchant thes ears!,this is an astonishing albumn that I highly reccomend. I listen to it dailyand never take it out of my player. This is truly one of the best bands to enchant these ears!
5,Simply Amazing,"""But anyways this John Petrucci is an awful guitarist, he should get lessons from Avril Lavigne or Brad Delson from Linkin Park. Theyre talented guitar players dat can pawn dis Petru$hit's a$$ anyday!!""I'm speechless. Reading that made me want to laugh and cry at the same time. And then scream. And then scream again. What is wrong with the world today.Buy Images & Words. Then buy everything else Dream Theater has ever made. Then organize a protest in your hometown against MTV and all current pop music (focusing on Hilary Duff and Lindsay Lohan). Please."
4,"4,5 stars Amazing album",This is of course one of their best albums if not the best. Its magical with a variety of good feelings and most importantly they know how to play music. This album is a seminar to all guitarists players. The melodies are fantastic and you really miss out if you haven't heard this album. The only disadvantage in a way is that is too technically and you may want to hear some times before you get used to it as i did.Either way just buy this album. Its a must for progressive metal fans.
5,"=== The BEST - DREAM THEATER cd , great melodic songs !!!","I like DREAM THEATER ... I like all the cds from them , Still IMAGES & WORDS is the best !!! --- MELODIC , CATCHY , HOOK FILLED SONGS ....With still alot of shredding !!! --- If you like this cd & DREAM THEATER ....Also check out this CD sold on AMAZON.COM --- MAGNITUDE 9 - "" REALITY IN FOCUS "" --- Another melodic progmetal band from USA"
5,The best dream theater album,"This band is phoenominal.Dream theater is by far the bestprogressive rock/metal band that I've ever heard.""Images and words"" I can listen to over and over agin.If you love band's that are very technical muciallyyou'll love these guys.Although there are alot of timechanges and solo's and all that good stuff,Let me tellya, you won't be dissapointed.Dream theater is I thinkone of the most underated band's and they should beeven bigger than what the already are.They are a wellknown,popular band and they have fans in every state.They put on a phoenominal show from beginning to end.in my opinion,it's better to see them live than to listento their albums.Remember the saying, what you see is whatyou get, well with Dream theater what you hear is what youget.They play every song to a tee and they never miss a note.I would suggest to own this album it's a classic and alsoit's my favorite album by them."
2,More like noise to me...,"Don't become confident because you just began hearing ""A Change of Seasons"", and think that Dream Theater are geniuses. You don't want to end up in the situation I was in, paying $20.00 for the ""Images And Words"" album, and was not worth it.You've got a mixture of Metallica, and a couple of good ballads and that's it. Dream Theater seemed to step off balance with this one, ultimately due to constant screaming, and excessive instrument playing. This is just complete ""noise"" to me, because hearing instruments playing (quitars, bass, drums, piano) for a combined 15 minutes I suppose, is uncalled for.The only songs on here that are ok is 'Surrounded', and 'Wait For Sleep'; they seem to have some definition added to it. The rest is all boring, mostly filled with screaming, and that's what makes this cd the most irritating.Get 'A Change of Seasons': there you have more quality, and not all the agitating vocal effects and annoying instruments playing."
4,Fan Favorite Album!!!,"This is Dream Theater Fan Favorite Album it has hits songs like Pull me under & Another Day & Take the Time.The good thing about Dream Theater is that every album thay have out is Great it's hard to chose whic one is the best.This album is Dream Theater most progressive Type album it as soft songs like Another Day and some progressive songs like Metropolis Part 1 ""The Miracle And The Sleeper"" & under a glass moon.This is good but i like systematic chaos and Awake and metropolis part 2 scenes from a memory and more of ther albums better than this one.Images & Words didnt age that well This album last up to 57 min."
3,Cake contains many calories,"Let's get straight to the point:""Pull me Under"" is boring. I wonder why it got so much airplay.Oh well, atleast MTV airs something that can actually be classified as music.""Take the Time"" starts with an awesome intro. Adds awesome vocals, and swifts into one of the best solo's ever. Far superior to everything else on this cd.""Another Day"" is nothing special, and neither is ""Surrounded.""""Metropolis"" starts boring, goes into an awesome 4-minute solo, and ends boring. So it's almost as if it goes full circle. *giggle*""√únder a Glass Moon,"" bah, NEXT!""Wait for Sleep"" has a cool intro, thats pretty much it for this song.""Learning to Live"" is boring. Seriously. Everyone seems to love this song, and I just don't understand why. Oh well."
2,Err... this ain't prog...,"In trying to broaden my prog horizons beyond Yes, Genesis, and KC I decided to pick up a Dream Theater CD since I've heard that they're sort of a ""metal/prog"" type band. I like some metal and I like prog, so I figured that I was in for a real treat. Boy, was I wrong...Ladies and gentlemen... Dream Theater is HAIR METAL! Sure, it's well-played hair metal - but this sure ain't prog. The singer is just awful (everytime his voice appears, I hear Beavis and Butthead yelling ""Change It! "") - I kept waiting for him to break into ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"". And while there are some interesting instrumental bits with the guitar, bass and drums, rest assured that a really obnoxious keyboard riff will destroy any musical momentum.If you like Dokken, Poison, or Winger you probably will love this stuff; but if you're a Yes/KC/ELP fan stay far away. If you're looking for new prog, check out ""Flower Kings,"" ""Transatlantic,"" or ""Porcupine Tree."""
1,more like a nightmare...,"i recently listened to this for the first time since the 1990s. i have remained very familiar with ""Pull Me Under"", but i was puzzled why i hadnt given this CD a spin in over 18 years!oh, thats why - BECAUSE IT SUCKS. wtf - rock vaudevillian music? meandering symphonies that tire and sure, are at a fierce meter and therefore difficult to play w/ perfection, but sound like absolute drivel.the cd rests in the trash bin at this moment. i actually endured the whole thing without screaming."
1,Of COURSE they're amazingly talented...,"...and can play the pants off almost any other band out there. That much is pretty obvious, no matter what you think of the songs.But, this sounds WAAAAAAAY too much like 1980's hair metal for my taste. And not the ""kinda okay in a silly mood because it's at least kinda heavy and at least faux-evil"" Motley Crue's ""Shout at the Devil"" or even the ""bluesy, gritty, sleazy and dirty"" G 'n' R's ""Appetite"" kind of hair metal way.... the really craptacular and loathsome Bon Jovi or Def Leppard kind of way...Musicianship is GREAT (ten star worthy on the strength of that alone), but the horrific songs, the style and tone is reminiscent of some of the worst music ever, to me (which is worth about negative 20 stars).To each their own, I guess."
2,Thanks for the singer.....,"Thanks for the singer I rate it two stars. The guy is simply ANNOYING!!! I just can't stand his vocals. Anyway, they are fit for Dream Theater, because most of the time these guys are not playing rock and roll or hard rock, they're just stating to themselves: ""LOOK HOW GOOD WE ARE! LOOK OUR TIME CHANGES, OUR VELOCITY, LOOK, LOOK!! LOOK AOUR SCREAMING HAIR METAL SINGER""The proof that trhis band ios nor for any taste is that it reached cult status: you can√© give a less positive review that you're attacked by all of its ""Intelligent"" and ""Music experts"" fans..."
2,Barely listenable,"I just don't see what's beyond the hype when it comes to Dream Theater. Maybe I'm just out of the loop but I just found ""Images and Words"" to be a tedious listen.Being a musician, I can certainly appreciate the talents of John Petrucci, Kevin Moore and John Petrucci but it the overwhelming ability of the members simply cannot compensate for the lackluster songwriting and long-winded guitar/keyboard indurance-fests. And the pseudo-intellectual lyrics didn't exactly win my adoration either.You won't hear anything substantial or mindblowing on Images and Words. What you will hear is 5 musicians trying really hard to out do eachother"
5,The best CD ever to exist in music history.,"Dream Theater are the most musically talented band of our time. This is my favorite CD by Dream Theater mainly because of Metropolis Part 1 (Although Learning to Live and Surrounded are beyond incredable). The lyrics are okay, but they have written better (Glass Prison, Metropolis Part 2:Scenes From a Memory) yet the guitar and keyboard solos are phemomenal. I was not very excited about the new vocalist, because I liked the one from ""When Dream and Day Unite"" very much, but he kind of grew one me and now I like him more than the old one, although I must confess that I wish the singer from Symphony X joined with DT. That would without a doubt be the best band ever. And now that I am drifting off topic from the CD itself, I might as well just conclude with saying buy this album or else you will be truly missing out"
5,Dream Theater newbie!,"So glad I took the advice of all the devoted DT fans who recommended this cd. I'm not really a prog rock fan, but one listen to the samples convinced me to buy this cd. Thanks to all the loyal DT fans who turned me into a new DT fan!"
5,I LOVE IT.. Just what I was looking for!,"I love it..smoth material, nice color, good quality..Fast delivery.. I'm very happy with this purchase."
4,good product for the money,My elementary school daughter has a learning disability in reading and this helps her check spelling and definitions of words. I recommend this product. It's appropriate for school and home use. It works with her own earphones if she needs to use the audio function in a public place.
3,I think I like it,"I can only say ""I think I like it "" (three stars) because this isn't really a product review, it's a service review. I still have not received the product, although I have been able to email the company about an exchange (they sent me the wrong item, so no Christmas gift) and keep in touch with them about the replacement, which looks like it's going to be a refund. I was notified about that on 1/11/12 but as of today, 1/17/12, there is no deposit to my bank account. I'd really just like to get the item for my son. Perhaps I'll go looking in a brick and mortar store and skip Amazon in the future."
4,My kids like it,"I bought it for my 6year girl & 7year boy. They use it for their homework.The size of a letter is good for kids. And they have fun to play ""Hangman"".They don't need other games."
2,Require you to mess with batteris everytime,The one I've got turns off and can't be turned on until you remove and re-insert batteries. This knocks off 2 stars (otherwise would be 3.5-4)
5,Great product...even for middle schoolers,"I bought this for one of my sixth grade students who has an extensive vocabulary, but a difficult time with spelling. The spell checker is able to figure out the words he types in even though they are often missing sounds/letters that you hear in the word. I thought he might think the look of it was babyish, but he actually loves it. It is much easier than using a dictionary to look up every word and seems to be motivating for him to have a cool gadget to use during lessons."
3,Served the purpose.,"I bought this for an adult ESL student who has never been to formal school, is just beginning to learn English and needed a speaking electronic dictionary. It is much less expensive than the adult version available in the USA (although you can get cheaper ones in China, or possibly on the used goods market) and has a vocabulary of 44000 words. It worked well for her and satisfied her needs, and probably will for a while to come. For kids, it seems like a useful resource till their vocabulary demands a more advanced resource, but hopefully by then they would be reading, writing and speaking fluently enough. For a more advanced ESL learner though I would recommend the Franklin Collegiate Dictionary; its much more extensive."
3,Annoying Speech,"This game is okay, but the ""easy"" level on hangman is a bit more difficult for my 8 year old than I would have imagined. The audio commentary from the game is monotone, slow and rather annoying. We had to purchase the talking dictionary for my son's school; otherwise, we would have returned it."
2,childrens talking dictionary,"With computer technology being what it is today, this product is really inferior. It seemed like more of a toy, and I could not take it seriously as an educational tool. The text display is difficult to read. I returned the one I ordered, as I felt my money could be spent on something better."
5,Buy this talking spell checker,"Each of my children has used these since they came out about 3 years ago. They work great and the speaking function really is helpful. Also, the cursive writing feature is a life saver when teaching cursive writing!!!"
4,good tool,"I bought this device because my daughter's school specializing in learning disabilities recommended it. It's deffinitely for the younger crowd since it doesn't have a lot of ""big"" words. It has a choppy computer voice-which is fine since my kids have not complained about it even though I don't care for it much. You can put any made up spelling word into it and it will give you choices of words to pick from that will be spoken to you. I found one word it didn't recognize- cake. It found ""cakes"", but not ""cake"" when I put it in as my son spelled it-kack. If your kid has spelling problems I highly recommend this product, especially if you are tired of spelling everything for them."
2,for kids under 8 better,we can't find lots of new vocabularies from the dictionery although it's fun for kid to learn by speaking the word out. The only thing I liked it best is that it provides handwriting letters for kids to learn. I suggest that kids under 8 can buy it.
5,Great tool for helping your child!,"I bought this dictionary/spell corrector for my 10 year old daughter in hopes that she will rely on this for spelling help as opposed to my computer. =) Everything seems to work great, but I cannot get the back to screw on properly for holding the batteries. Other than that, great tool!"
3,It's not so good.,Very nice design and good price. but the screen too small and every letter when you push in the sound come out. when my child check the spelling words the screen showing very slow. my child don't like to use at all.
1,Stay away...from this Junk,This is a piece if junk. I have never written a review in my life but its so bad that I was forced to write this. I bought this for my son in 2nd grade and he can never find what he is looking for. I am going to buy another one for him now. Don't waste your money on this junk.
3,Too much of robotic accent,"I bought a Franklin HW-1216 as a gift for someone and was impressed with it, except for its lousy build quality. When I read that this one is a talking dictionary, I bought it for my daughter. It's same as Franklin HW-1216 except that it has a built-in speaker. Unfortunately, word pronounciations are too robotic with a good mix of asian accent. Read out is painful to listen to and punctuations are horrible. Extra money you pay for this unit over HW-1216 to get the talking part is pretty useless or rather counterproductive. If I have to buy one more I would buy HW-1216. If a product is marketed for the use of 6-11 year olds it should be built appropriately. I do not think it will last more than an year or so."
5,Kid loves it,I bought this for my kid and it works great! Right price Right item right gift. Will help with their school work.
3,great concept but voice is not clear,This needs to be perfected. It does not speak the words back to you clearly.It is okay but not worth the money.
3,Just Ok,"My kid 6/7 using it, easy to use , buttons are big and use aaa batteries.cons: speaker quality is ok, could not find many 6/7 grader words in this dictionaryWould recommend for a better version this, since kids outgrow fast with this dictionary."
3,Not What I Expected,"I have two children with special needs and I bought this item for the one with problems processing speech and language. Upon installing batteries I was amped to see this product in action. The spell corrector is what really caught my eye with this product. I put one of his spelling words for the week into it and it didn't even come close to correcting the spelling. I pulled out the instructions for exacts on features and there are some good features but not really what I bought it for.One good thing about this contraption is that it got my daughter who has mod/severe autism interested. She likes to try and spell with it which has me surprised since she is usually uninterested in many things.I believe as my son matures and his brain develops more, he will be able to use this product in many situations but for now it won't cut it.There are suggestions for other brands on the other Franklin kid's dictionary listing that I think I will look into. Good thing this didn't cost much."
3,"a good product, but not super durable","It really helped my son with spelling, but it broke easily in his backpack. I'd say be wary if you have a boy who shoves things in his backpack to get out of the school as soon as possible!"
1,Lousy Quality/Defective,"I purchased this for my twin daughters' birthday. We couldn't get it to work for more than 5 minutes. It kept getting stuck (we couldn't even turn it on or off to clear it). No wonder there is a reset button on the back of the unit as this was the only way to solve the problem. Also the speaker sometimes crackled. Perhaps there was a short in the unit; hence, all the problems. The voice sounded terrible and very mechanical. As my daughter played tic-tac-toe, it kept saying 'my turn' every time it was the computer's turn. It sounded really weird and annoying. I've asked for a full refund. I'm looking for something of more quality. Too bad, it looked like a really cute product."
2,Loved it while it lasted,"My 11 year old autistic son loved this talking dictionary until it stopped reading the words after about a week. It was never handled roughly. It just stopped rather suddenly for no apparent reason. Of course - the paperwork that came with it basically said, oh well. too bad. Other reviews suggested it wouldn't last - but I wanted to give it a try."
3,"A fair effort, but a tad familiar to fans of Fletch","Skylar Whitfield conjures up memories of a younger,less savvy I.M. Fletcher (see ""Fletch"")as he careensaround his redneck hometown trying to clear himselfof murder charges. His interplay with his Harvardtrained cousin seems forced and phony at times, andthe ""smarter than the average redneck"" attitude hasbeen seen before in ""Son of Fletch"". If you haven'tread the ""Fletch"" series, ""Skylar"" can be a fun read,but for ""Fletch"" and ""Flynn"" fans, the book is a caseof been-there, done-that."
2,love our remin Concord III luggage carrier,"We owned our first Remin for at least 20 years and used it every time we travel anywhere with more than one light ""carry-on bag"" It is particularly useful for carring 2-3 boxes at a time from our city apartment to our waiting car for weekend trips to the country. It is rugged, doesen't bend the way cheeper models do whehn you put real weight on it, and it is virtually indestructable. We also use it for bringing our 55 lb. portable air condition er up from the cellar to be installed for summertime use.So much luggage now comes with their own built in wheels, but we still find our Remin Concord III essential for carrying any item that doesn't have them, from large boxes to be shipped to camp coolers.We wouldn't be buying a new one now except that ours ecenly ""disappeared""_ when we left it unattended recently. What better recommendation could you ask for?"
5,One Sun One Moon - a journey you'll want to take again & again!,This cd is pure magic! Just sit back & let it guide you on an enchanted musical voyage from 'sunrise' to 'midday rain' to 'deep night.' I guess you might describe this as 'new age' music if you HAD to put it in a category but that doesn't seem to do it justice - this is in a class by itself!! All I can say is listen & you'll see what I mean.
3,Good overview of Christian persecution,Good overview of the current situation of the persecution of Christians around the world. Somewhat lacking in specific examples.
1,Couldn't be worse writing,"I can go along with loose, improbable plot strings and poor chartacter development up to a point. But the inane dialog and the awkward, limping, adolescent writing and desperate need of a competent editor make this book positively painful to read. One co-author, Richard Brookes, claims that ""he is finally developing a talent for writing that was evident from his earliest years...""Sorry, Charlie--what was finally developing was wanting to write, without, in fact, a talent for it. the two aren't at all the same."
4,Killer Unknowns,"This is a great disc by a great band that never made it past middle level. Their second disc ""Course"" is equally as good."
5,Great Rock Album,Collision is what every rock band wants to be. They have the ability to move you & make you feel what they are trying to say. Its all about the groove not about the complexity. Sit back & prepare to be impressed!!
2,not our favorite playmobil advent calendar,"This advent calendar is pretty lackluster, many of the days are boring. Last year we had winter in the park and it was much more suited towards christmas. We didn't realize that the knights wouldn't have anything to do with xmas at all and just provided a bunch of crappy swords and nothing that was really exciting for toddlers. Maybe this would be better for much older kids, but other advent calendars we've gotten have been fun for all ages."
4,Good reference for the FPGEE,"I used this book with the Comprehensive Pharmacy Review for the FPGEE. It contains 1000 Q&A's with thorough explanations. It focussed on all areas of FPGEE, and it was really good for the pharmacy management section (explained all the formulas and where to use them). The only thing I didn't like about it was that there wasn't an index for any of the keywords in the questions (it would have been nice to easily refer back to the page you remembered seeing a question instead of having to go thru all the 1000 questions to find it) , and towards the end of the book brand names were being used instead of the generics. Overall I would recommend using this book, I found it very useful in addition to the Comprehensive Pharmacy Review."
2,It's not worth enough,"I bought this book for FPGEE. This will not give you full idea on any topic, it will be useful only for last minute preparation.There are some 600+ questions, answers are not fully descriptive. If there is a problem to solve, this book just uses some formula and gives you the answer, he did not explain why we are using this formula for this particular problem. ..."
3,Beginners book,"This book is really good if you absolutely don't know anything. It doesn't really tell you how to use the software beyond simple one page websites, which really doesn't help if you are trying to do something more involved. The data disk does however have some good software trail versions on it."
4,excellent booklet and discographies,"Deep purple MK I with Hush, kentucky woman, bird has flown, emmeretta has good tracks! DP Mk II with smoke on the water, woman from tokyo, demon's eye, never before has excellent tracks!DP MK III & MK IV with love child, you keep on moving, coronarias redig and might just take your life has excellent tracks, but where are burn and stormbringer?the point has 4 stars from a great DP fan!"
3,Does the job but could be better,"I moved into an existing home that already had a Delta 3 garage door receiver. I purchased this and was mildly disappointed. You do not have the flexibility to program in a code that is easy to remember. Depending on how the flip switches are set on the receiver, that is the code that you will need to enter. It works fine, is easy to install, and appears to hold up to the elements. My only complaint is that I would like to have the ability to enter my own personal rather than it being based on dip switch settings."
3,B-!,"Book was in ok shape, some wear to the spine which is to be expected along with rough edges to the cover and backing."
5,I grew up loving these books!,"I moved around a lot as a kid and I managed to misplace the entire series in one of the many garage sales we held. I have missed the Value books ever since. They provide an excellent means of teaching kids some of the most abstract and difficult lessons of life. I hope that someday I can find them again. In the meantime, I can comfort myself in imagining that they have found their way into some small hands that will cherish them as much as I did (and still do!)."
3,"A gripping story . . . uh, yeah!","Presents a good lesson featuring the best scientist in history for whom I have a deep respect, but gives me nightmares since I read it as a kid! I researched the real story and some facts are incorrect. If I liked it, yes & no for these reasons. Haunting,& it changed the course of my life."
5,"no one remembers this cd, but they should.","everyone knows the song ""i'll be there for you"" of ""friends"" fame... but no one remembers the rembrandts before that, unles they know the song ""that's just the way it is, baby"" i think they need more credit for untitled, which actually had 2 songs in the top 10 in the winter of 92 (johnny, have you seen her?"" and ""chase the clouds away"") i honestly think that untitled is ten times the album that l.p. is...songs like ""i'll come calling"" ""sweet virginia"" ""maybe tomorrow"" and ""johnny have you seen her"" just aren't paralleled. this cd is a masterpiece."
2,They&#65533;ll Be There For You Too,"If you're into schmaltzy sugar pop just this side of bubblegum The Rembrandts are for you. If you are wondering what they sound like they did the theme song from friends; that track is NOT on this album, but every song on the album sounds just like it. If you like that sort of grating blandness, have at."
3,Fair,"A little large but very pretty, I'm not sure if the size was listed?, if it was I didn't see it. Even the post are large for my pieced ear."
1,Plagued with errors,"This would be a worthwhile book if it weren't plagued with so many errors. From the looks of it, no one took time to proof it prior to publication. There are mistakes in the numerical values for constants (ex. bond angle of 109.05 when it should be 109.50). There are typos in other equation values (i.e. 1.2 10^-3 M instead of 1.2 x 10^-3 M). If I had known there would be so many typos, I would have gotten a different review book. There are plenty of choices available. I feel like Kaplan had a group of non-English speaking (or writing) authors contribute to this book and then failed to have a competent editor look at it before printing. I'm disappointed to say the least. I used the version before this to study for my first DAT attempt and it was not nearly this poorly edited."
2,Too many errors!!!,"This book was a very BRIEF review of a great deal of very complex topics. That being said, this book was loaded with editorial errors and confusing typos. Even the formulas had errors, which for an exam of this caliber, is unacceptable."
3,OKAY,"that how it came just okay , the sound was good , but the video was poor . to bad I love Danny Kaye. ART"
2,More about how to care for a dog and not as much about pointers!,"I read the reviews on other websites about this book - based on that I should have passed on this book. We adopted a GSP from the shelter and knew very little about the breed. If you have NEVER owned a dog - then this is the book for you. But if you want more specific information on the GSP as a family dog, pick up this book by Nancy Campbell :""The German Shorthaired Pointer - An Owners Guide"" instead."
4,good,thebook is good and the service was very good. got here about 5 days after it shipped which was much quicker than i expected. book is great. if you havent read it and your reading this series i highly suggest getting it. the series only gets better as it goes along. im now on book 8 and almost done with it and i dont want to put them down
5,poignant and timely,two comments about this film:1. just try to watch it without shedding a tear2. think of the soldiers in iraq while you watch
2,"Great movie, terrible DVD","This is a great movie. One of the most touching examinations of foreign war's effect on the homefront ever filmed. There is no doubt that it can still speak to audiences today. However, this is a terrible DVD. The picture quality is poor. It is filled with scratches and lines. Even if these things were inevitable with age, the presentation is not even in letterbox. Here's the kicker. About an hour and a half into the movie you have to turn the disc over! There have been a couple of other DVD's of this film released in the past couple of years. Buy one of those."
3,Now that we are home,"I thought the main character was Harold Russell, who displayed his wounds like a real pro. Dana Andrews never inspired me. In fact, one reported cited Andrews as ""always looking like he was smelling something bad."" March, Loy did their job. Virginia Mayo, did what she was suppose to do, whatever that means."
4,A good adaptation of post-WWII life,"I bought this movie for one of my classes, as it was required to watch. The movie was actually very interesting-perhaps cheesy at points, but the plot, overall, was good, and i thought it depicted post-WWII life for returning soldiers and their families well. Of course, the movie has its typical love problems, but all ends well in the end. Though I probably wouldn't have normally just picked up this movie to watch (not that I would have even found it around here), I enjoyed it, and I'm glad my professor had us watch it."
3,Subversive Tone,"A much too long dramatic piece that tells the intertwined tales of three ex-servicemen and their families attempting to adjust to civilian life after WW II. Of particular interest, however, is the somewhat ""subversive"" tone dealing with such previously taboo social isues as adultery, divorce, unfeeling bankers, unbridled capitalism, and tainted patriotism. The amputee was outstanding in his role--as I understand it, he was an amateur actor rather than a professional."
5,Stands Up Beautifully,"The Best Years of Our Lives is amazing in its timeliness. It is a wonder that such a movie, which intelligently handled the returning of three vets of World War II, could be made so soon after the end of the war, including pointed references to Hiroshima and a not so veiled stab at the anit-Communist hysteria growing in the country, and could be made so well that it goes beyond to timely into timeless. The three returnees are Frederic March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell and they handle their chores very well indeed. Myrna Loy is on hand to give another beautiful portrayal of an intelligent wife with a forgiving twinkle in her eye. The film is almost three hours long and it handles this time with great skill. A wonderful look at the effects on war on the home front after the fighting is over."
5,The Best Years of Our Lives,"Its a great movie filled with love, friendship, and family. Its a great World War II movie that shows what people had to go through to find jobs and get around."
5,This is why people like movies,"I've seen a lot of movies, but this is easily the best movie about WWII post-war. In fact, I can't think of a better film...about anything. Story, directing, acting, CASTING...wow. Why can't movies this good still be made? When you see this, and I hope you do, carry a hanky (or a blanket). But don't worry, you will LOVE it............ Then go thank a member of that generation."
4,Why no extras?,"What's with MGM? The movie itself deserves at least five stars: the wonderful acting of the greatest stars of the forties (Dana Andrews, Fredric March, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, etc.), the unforgettable performance by a real war veteran (Harold Russell),the groundbreaking cinematography by Gregg Toland, etc.,etc. But WHY no commentary track? WHY no making of documentaries? WHY no features examining the social relevance of both the film and the issues connected to it? With so much money and effort wasted on inferior popular entertainment, the treatment of this excellent film is unforgivable."
5,Excellent Post-WW2 Story Deserved The Oscar,"Seeing The Best Years Of Our Lives makes me even more appreciative of our surviving WW2 Vets-you have my thanks & my gratitude for fighting to keep America safe. I don't get to watch this movie often, but on the rare occasions that I do, it never fails to move me and there is always something new to catch my attention. The entire cast is top-notch & you can't take your eyes away from this film. Frederic March, Dana Andrews, Harold Russell, Myrna Loy & Teresa Wright are all outstanding in their roles. Teresa Wright also played a supporting role in another William Wyler masterpiece-Mrs. Miniver. They sure don't make 'em like this anymore, folks-so please get this film & treasure it. Very highly recommended."
2,Inconspicuous,"t's hard to believe that this soap opera was ever considered meaningful; shallow, even after considering the circumstances at the time of its release. May be the most overrated film of all time. And to think that this film beat out ""It's a Wonderful Life"" for best picture!"
5,must-buy,I thought this was a great reflection of how America was right after World War 2. I wish we had soda shops like the one in this movie these days.
5,A classic,"I was glad to see that this movie is still available on DVD. Between the movie and its actors, it won seven Oscars. (Harold Russell won TWO for his part of Homer)I've read some reviews that complained about the image quality from the transfer to DVD. I thought the image quality was okay - a little film grain, but I can't complain about that - after all, this movie is now over 65 years old."
5,Wonderful Movie!,I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine. I can't tell you how many times he has watched it. He absolutely loves it!
1,SO ANNOYING,"just finished all the 10 modules for the most boring, s**t cheap, simulation from Anthropology 228. I better not encounter a real Dr. Radcliffe-Pritchard or whoever made Ethnoquest or I'll wring their neck 10 times!!!The simulation is a drag, and the questions are so objective. I suppose that's the whole concept of anthropology, but the entire experience is unstimulating and uninspiring.Doing this material is so dreadful it felt like total coercion having to complete it."
4,Impressed,"I was impressed at this textbook. It is still in very good condition, the CDs that come with the textbook work properly, and I received the book in a good time, enough to start my assignments for my Intro to Cultural Anthropology class."
2,"Great when it worked, but temperamental","I bought this against my better moral judgment (Rhapsody partnered on at least one major event with Maxim), but I have no one to blame for that but myself. The device was great when it worked, but it took many agonizing, sometimes fruitless calls to Rhapsody Support to resolve what should have been simple, straightforward compatibility issues. There were several times I had to reformat the device, which meant wiping it clean and reloading it -- the kicker came when Rhapsody wouldn't recognize the device at all, and after frogging around with it for too long, to no avail, I gently tossed it across the room, where it died altogether! It felt good to get my frustration out, and I didn't even feel bad when the thing died. I may try my luck with the ibiza Rhapsody. Reviews are much better, and as an appliance co., they probably don't partner with magazines that exploit and objectify half of humanity!"
1,"I really wanted to like this product, but it was awful","I wrestled with this product for hours. I could get it to work, but then it would stop. I would get it to work, then it would stop. The Rhapsody DRM is just not ready for prime time. Google ""clix sync with your pc"" to read all the complaints."
2,Be careful not to drop it.,"I had the Iriver Clix for several weeks and loved it. All that music!But today I dropped it on a wooden floor. And that was the end of my $189 Clix. The screen went black, except for a few thin white lines. Now those are gone.Conclusion: nice device but too fragile considering the cost; will try the Sandisk next. At least that's only $89-99."
4,Good Item,"Great item, plays what you want, good quality. To the reviewer below, are you are aware that the official site offers a firmware package alternative? You can get that, depending on the one you download, either turn the non-Rhapsody version into the Rhapsody, OR, the Rhapsody into the Non-Rhapsody version.http://iriverinc.com/support/ultra/Clix2change.aspxEasy instructions so that you can buy this version and just turn it back into a non-Rhapsody one."
2,"Good Idea, but not practical","Very well made product, but our one-year old son would not use it. We have the Deuter Kid Comfort II. Not sure if it would work better to wait until he actually fell asleep to put it on his neck, but then that could possibly wake him up. Also, difficult to store because of its bulkiness."
1,Beck Arnley boot kit,"I was not happy with this product, it fell apart after only 1 week of being on the car. I would not recommend it."
3,Not unacceptable,Sometimes you get more than you pay for. This is not one of those purchases. This set performs about as expected for cheap blades.
2,Short stories aren't very good.,Rating is based on reading only the first stories.........didn't like so I haven't finished .
2,Continuing the Childe Cycle,"The novels ""Young Bleys"" and ""Other"" tells the story of Bleys Ahrens, founder of the Others, who has set himself against Hal Mayne and his plan to unite the splinter cultures. Both novels are very long with not that much happening. If they were cut considerably and combined in one book, it would have been a lot more interesting."
4,a needful development of the villain of the series...,....who in the other books was a mysterious if cardboard bad guy. In OTHER you find out more about who he is and why he's a match for Hal Mayne.
4,Is it possible to NOT like 80's hip-hop?,"That IS a rhetorical question, by the way.These ladies are so much fun to listen to! ""You're Never Gonna Get It"" brings me back to my childhood. The rhythms, the inserted rap (before profanity and the ""N"" word were requirements), the harmonies, the attitude. It makes you happy! Not their best album, but an excellent listen!"
5,missvirgo59,"My old school collection is coming together slowly but surely. I love this CD. happy, happy, happy. One step at a time in getting my CD collection back. :-)"
4,The album was really great.,"This is definitely an album you can groove to. If you like songs that not only have a great beat to snap your fingers to and have an important message to send about stereotypes, then you will definitely love the track, ""Free Your Mind"". This track is full of heart and tons of Rock and Roll."
4,Great Album,"This is a great album, EnVogue has certainly earned their mark in music history. The best song on here is Free Your Mind- AWESOME! Really good- go out and get it!"
2,Stay away,Not worth your time. I'm glad I bought this cd used. It only cost me a penny! I wouldn't purchase this if I were you.
4,Horse People,"I bought this book for my dressage teacher for Christmas, and couldn't help reading most of it. Now I need to buy me one to finish and to keep. Highly recommend!"
4,"Yah, Man!","I bought this CD cheeep. If it was packaged in vinyl, I would display the artwork. Great effort but some funky, sumfing ta dooo kinda guys. Very lovely!"
2,Scary cat turns into a ball,My 12 month old twins are frightened of this video. I was excited to buy this video for my kids thinking it would combine their interest in domestic pets with some classical music and some basic physics concepts thrown in. What I got was a big disappointment. From the moment I put this tape in they have disliked the computer generated cat (who has a sort of evil grin) and are particularly disturbed by the parts where it turns into a ball. Not a video that I would recommend to most parents with kids under 3.
1,A great disapointment !,"We were expecting at least a decent video according to the raving reviews on the site. Unfortunately, the video is very short and the parts that repeat most have no educational value whatsoever. It is a waste of money and our son does not like the video at all, neither do we!!! Getting some Amazing Animals videos are a better investment and children are bound to love Henry the lizard. The videos are better priced and packed with information. Newton is a bottle is a well advertised waste of money."
5,Dale fan,This book is great for anyone who loved DAle and relates to her life. She wrote this many years ago but is practical for today. How simple she writes about so many daily problems we face and the conclusions are so simple.
4,Good for backup,"What is good about this zip drive is that it is very easy to install, and requires basically no configuration, just plug in, and install the software. The one thing I don't like about it is it sometimes freezes up your computer while you are backing up files. I mean you don't have to restart the computer or anything, you just can't do anything else for a couple minutes. Sometimes that can be a pain. All in all though, its still a good product."
1,The Iomega drive engineers need a dope-slap,"My Zip 100 suffered from the ""Click of Death"" and I lost about five disks and the whole drive before I learned on the Internet about this well-known problem.I gave Iomega my email address when I registered my drive but they didn't tell me that using their well-documented defective drives ruins the disk with loss of all data.But, I had to get my data off, so I bought a Zip 250 and today I had the Click of Death again with total loss of data and a ruined expensive disk. Arrggh!Needless to say, I would NEVER recommend a Zip drive and I am planning on forever boycotting Iomega.And, if you happen to run into a Zip drive engineer who designed this turkey, please give him or her a (gentle) dope slap for me.Who at Iomega thought this piece of engineering garbage was suitable for valuable data?(If you are tempted to by a Zip, anyway, search for ""Click of Death"" ...before buying a Zip drive. I wonder how many countless gigabytes of data have been lost?)"
3,Parallel is so yesterday...,"I loved the Zip 100 back a year or so ago but its now the age of USB! Having to shut down your machine, connect the drive and turn it on for this device is annoying when you move it around alot. You will also have driver problems on older computers so go internal or USB when possible."
1,Sloow,"Do yourself a favor, set up any back-up(s) just before you go to bed. Backing up on any Iomega external device is the equivalent of watching paint dry. You can however use that time to see if you're one of the lucky few that can get decent tech support from Iomega."
1,The Ebola Virus of Zip drives,"Do you enjoy spending hours on hold waiting for technical assistance? Do you like wasting days trying to get a piece of poorly designed equipment to work? Enjoy having your computer crash and to see data corrupted? Have a lot of time on your hands? If so you'll love all Iomega products. This one is particularly bad. Slow, expensive and worthless. They also have the worst technical assistance of any company I have ever dealt with."
2,"Oh god, get out of my face","I can simply say that buying this product was one of the worst choices of my life. I find it more convinient to set up slave drives than to use this. There are products that are definetely better and worth your money out there, this is just a rip off."
3,Not a bad album,"All in all, this album was OK. If you want to know how good it is compared to the Rossington Collins Band, it's not as good as their first album, Anytime Anyplace Anywhere, but better than their second one. A few of the songs that stand out on this album are ""Time After Time"" and ""This Ride's On Me"". The rest are OK, but there's kind of an emptiness to them. They don't have much soul."
3,Cocaine and Cuban Cigars..Are cigars more of a threat than cocaine?,"I have read this book twice. It is not for readers who assume that cops are the panacea to the down and dirty world of drug trafficking. The American people must put a stop to this insanity, like illegal immigration that's killing our country and its economy through cheap substandard labor and a sieve of cocaine through the porous borders. What the hell is wrong with this picture when we're fighting terrorism, yet letting illegals through unabated. Think about this serious danger to our security. Are Cuban cigars as bad as cocaine?? Crazy!"
4,Chapter 16,"Chapter 16 by Rodney Stich is right on. Truth is stranger than fiction in this chapter segment. Fighting communists by supplying our rebels with guns bought with dope is wrong when that dope hits our streets in this country and our kids, Shame on Congress and Boland! George"
1,"Beware, it's an enclosure not a external drive","Beware people. This is not a true usb external hard drive. This is an enclosure with a 300 gb hard drive stuck in it. NO WHERE in the description does it even elude to this fact.If you want an enclosure, buy it. If you want a real usb external hdd, don't.kd"
3,It's ok,"I bought this album assuming that is was going to be a little bit better than it was, there are a few songs on it that are pretty good, but I've been spoiled by groups like Gotan Project and Sidestepper, and just thought this was gonna be as good, but it's just ok..songs 2, 3 and 5 are my favs off this album and the rest sound like amatuer beats and music..but it's one of those albums worth having in you tango/electonic library."
1,What light??,"This is a waste of time and money. The light ""included"" doesn't light up anything. Don't bother -- you will only strain your eyes."
1,Poor design,"I thought this would be just the thing to have handy when reading and come across a new word. As others said, the built in light is not very bright and the bigger problem I had was when I was keying in the word I needed a definition for, I had to press down hard to get the letter to register. One word took 3 tries!! Didn't keep this one-certainly not worth the money."
1,The buttons don't work,"I ordered this in spite of some of the bad reviews about the light; I didn't need the book light so I wasn't concerned that it wasn't bright enough. However, when the dictionary arrived, many of the buttons didn't work, such as L, M, and other letters in that corner of the keybord. The on/off button only works sporadically. I'm returning this product."
1,Went back!,"There is a glitch in the software so it does not bring up the right words. If you buy it, start typing in jacuzzi and see what happens. This one went back - recommend you save yourself the trouble."
2,Pagemark Dictionary,"I ordered one of these, and one for my book reading friend. I kept mine, and wrapped hers. I just got to see her yesterday and was embarrassed when she opened hers, to find that the AAA batteries were corroded. I went back home and checked mine and my batteries, too were corroded.After we both replaced the batteries with our own, it appears to work well."
2,It's cheap for a reason,"I bought this product because I just wanted a cheap dictionary that fit easily inside my books for whenever I came across a word that I wanted to see the definition for. However, I personally found it to be a waste of money. I barely got any use out of it, because nearly every time I used it half of the letters wouldn't work on the keyboard, thus rendering it practically useless. I tried resetting it and replacing the battery, both of which made it work the first time I used it again, then it quit working again after that. If you're like me and you just want a portable, convenient dictionary that fits inside your books, I would suggest spending a little more money on a better quality one because this one just isn't worth wasting your time or money on."
1,Not worth even sale price,"Complete piece of junk. Some of the letters don't work. My daughter could not get many of the extra functions to work, either. More frustration than help."
1,Not worth,i bought this for my 8 years old cousin. Keyboard is like touch screen buttons. right side of the keyboard buttons are not even working even for the first time. and light is so dim. dont waste your money.
2,Skil 12V Battery Pack,"I bought this battery pack as a replacement for the original and it worked great for about one year, now it won't hold a charge. It was used for occasional home projects"
4,As advertised,"It's what I expected at a good price. So far, it works as well or better than the original. I've only put a couple hours on it so far though, and with batteries time is what separates the good from the bad."
2,Skil Battery 12V,Dissapointed in this battery for its cost vs its working life. Within a year and a half it was bad abnd wouldn't take a charge any more so I went to a better brand of drill system that Sears sells.
5,Great for your Eagles fan,"This shot glass is exactly as advertised, good quality, great graphics, prompt shipping taking care to pack the glass carefully."
3,Let's fly... For REAL!,"I understand if you want this CD in your hands with the covers and everything for your collection, but otherwise, there is a digital download available now. I got mine from RealPlayer, saved some money and still own the music I love. This one's rare on CD, but not $200 dollars rare, at least not anymore! Hope this review helps you get this album on CD for less if you haven't already. Later"
2,Be careful with this camera,Always have purchased Olympus cameras however the mechanics of this camera are not smooth and too sensative for users. We had camera only 1 day and the camera was defective. If you accidently leave the lens cap on and turn on camera it will jam the mechanics of the lens which will not allow camera to operate. If you choose you can pry the retractable lens out but one should not make a camera mechanics so sensative. Everything else about the camera was great! In comparison the Sony brand lens moves with less clicking noise and is much smoother and doesnt try to operate if the lens cap is left on. As you can see we converted from Olympus to Sony. Somewhat of a disappointment for we have used Olympus for over 15 years.
3,Lens needs work,It seems like a great camera but the previous reviewer is right about the lens. I liked the feature of the f 1.8 lens for low light situations. The barrel distortion however is awful. I rejected this camera. I was ready to order one and went to Circuit City to look at one. I checked out a post in the viewscreen and it was bowed as I panned to each extreme.I am back looking at other cameras.
2,Smart Media is a poor choice,"Nice camera. It'd be on my list if it only used Compact Flash memory cards. Smart Media is much smaller in capacity (128mb vs over 1000mb). This is a very important consideration when looking at any camera which produces such large image files. Smart Media isn't very smart. Since unlike Compact Flash it has no onboard controller. (meaning fatal error happen much more often). Transfer speed is much slower. How long do you wish to wait between shots? The slower the memory card, the longer the wait. And including a measly 16mb memory stick is a JOKE on a 4 megapixel camera. It can hold 2-3 raw images. Also in a camera costing this much, rechargable batteries and a charger should be standard (and for many other cameras it is)."
1,Poor Customer Service,"The camera is great, however, don't loose your CD! If you happen to misplace your Camedia software CD, as I did, you will have to shell out [more money] plus shipping to get a replacement disk. Olympus won't let you download the software from their site and claim it's expensive to replace:""Due to the high cost associated with replacing the software, we can provide one free copy only per purchase. Unfortunately, if you have lost the original CD, the only way to obtain the software would be to purchase a replacement CD from the Olympus Emporium.""...Why they don't let their customer download the software is beyond me. The required software only takes up 12.8 MB. At the very least, they could have emailed me the replacement. I would not purchase a digital camera from Olympus again unless the offered online support for their software."
3,GIVE IT A PASS,Our previous camara was a HP it was easy to use the soft ware was a dream and life was sweet. When we decided to move up to a camara with 4mgpxl we looked around and decided on the Olympus c4040. This was a major mistake. The camara is not bad but the soft ware is a nightmare and the interface with the computer is not user friendly. we are selling this thing and buying another HP
4,Great Camera - but...,"Overall, this is a fantastic camera. The resolution is astonishing, clarity is excellent. The only problem I've found is with some of the attachments and specialty lenses. I got the UV filter, which is highly recommended by the manufacturer as a protective cover for the lens. You need this if you're planning on using a telephoto or fish-eye lens. The problem? If you're using one of these lenses, you *have* to have an external flash because the adapter is so long that it casts a shadow from the internal flash. It also blocks part of the view in the viewfinder, so you can't see the entire frame.Otherwise, I've found no flaws. I do recommend a flash memory reader so you can avoid using the tiny USB cable that comes with the camera. Seems faster, too.Overall, I'm still loving my camera - use it nearly every day!"
4,C4040 very impressive,"I bought the C4040 a few months back and love the camera. The bright lens allows great low light shots. With the noise reduction, the low light photos are great. The menu is somewhat complex or layered and there are not too many short cuts like some of the Canons have. The images are very easy to down load, infact it's acts as a removable drive, so you can just drag images. The C5050 corrected this, but the price is much higher. The Negative is also the printed manual is basically useless. You have to put in the CD for the full manual. The camera is not a compact, so I ended to getting a S200 Elph for places where I wanted a super-compact. The lens cap design is very poor. Infact I added a tiffen filter tube to protect the lens when it powers on."
3,They Look Okay,"They look okay, about what you would expect for the price. What I personally didn't like was that the chain part is sort of stiff and thick in my ear holes. Some people may have bigger piercings than I have and not find that a problem."
2,Only for Hughes worshipers,"Not up to the standards you would expect considering how good his recent anthology release is. The tunes don't hold up well in a acoustic setting, go figure! The production is average at best, kinda grainy. His most recent recordings are excellent but this is not."
5,Excellent!,I thoroughly enjoyed this film...it has revealed a lot of new and insightful information the lamestream media will not provide you.
1,Possibly the dumbest thing I've seen,"Regardless of how ""engaging"" this ""documentary"" attempts to be, it is, quite possibly, the dumbest argument I've heard from those who want to debunk global warming. A total, and I mean TOTAL, attack on human intelligence and cognitive ability. I actually googled it twenty minutes in to make sure it wasn't a mockumentary."
2,enough!,"I respect and love George Acosta. Awake,PM, and Miami are some of my favorite cds, but he may have went down a few notches on my respect meter for putting out this cd. Its a fun cd and its cool if you want to remanise on some older tracks, but the whole idea of the cd is lame to me!I mean how many cds are there out right now with all these old trance songs on it? It was great to hear the John Secada song and all, but you can get ( in most cases ) a cheaper trance anthems cd almost anywhere; trance party, untra trance, any of the trance anthoms cd, love to trance, trance anthoms, ext.Its always good to see George Acosta put out a new cd, but I think he is a better dj then that."
3,"Mediocre,not at all what I expected","When I first heard this was coming out,I was overjoyed because anything by Acosta is usually nothing but the best.In this case,however;I was dissapointed because this is rather dull and boring material(with the exception of a few songs.)Cd 1 is super bland ,having only 2 or 3 good songs towards the end.Cd 2 has about 4 or 5 including the awesome ""Just Another Day""remix with John Secada.To begin with,trance anthems are for newbies and way too commercialized.Commercial crap =ATB,New Tiesto,etc.Sadly it seems as if Acosta rushed to get this on store shelves.Dont buy this unless you are a newbie,Acosta has plenty of other good albums like ""Awake and ""Lost World."""
2,are you serious?,"I gave two stars for the fact that these tracks are trance classics. They are dance floor stormers. They bring me back to great times and these tracks are timeless. I negged the other three stars because there are, literally, HUNDREDS of CD compilations that have been made in the past few years with ALL of these same tracks. This is simply another record company capitalizing on the past. Don't be a sucker, this CD is for newbies."
3,Jon F****IN Secada ???? WTF !!!!!!!,"This is a good compilation of Trance classics BUT........George, what the HELLLLLL is Jon F'N Secada DOING ON THIS CD ???? Oh my god...George...George...George...you LOST A LOT of dj street cred by including Jon ""sugar pop latin bile"" on your otherwise good CD. WOW. REALLY?? I can only imagine that Jon is your boy. He deserves to be on this CD as much as Elvis. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS."
4,Another good one from my favorite trance dj!,"Hands down Acosta is the man ...the best trance dj in the buisness.With 15 years of experience behind the decks,this man has NEVER ceased to amaze me with his mixes.Every one of his albums are different which proves that he's evolving into an even better dj!I wouldn't say this is the best,but he did an excellent job with the track selection.This cd brings back the awesome memories of a few years ago when I joined the dance scene,and pours out emotions as it progresses.This man is so talented he could take anything and mix it together.Some of his best mixes include ""Awake"" ""AM PM"" and ""Miami""Give this one a listen you wont be dissapointed!"
2,Very Thin,"The item looks exactly as appears; however, for the cost I thought the item would be thicker than it is. Its very thin and lightweight for a blanket/throw. Otherwise, the purchasing was fine."
3,Not my type of Bloodsucker,"I did not like this book at all. The story was confusing and convoluted. I don't know who had power who didn't and why. It was extremely hard to follow. I didn't even like the hero and heroine and could not wait to reach the last page. The sex was, of course, very hot, but for me the characters made it less than a erotic."
4,Don't judge a book by its cover!,"I didn't pay too much attention when I was reading about this book, but it sounded like what I was after, so I bought it. When it arrived, I was a little disappointed at how thin a volume it is.Once I started reading, I was so glad I bought it, I ordered the next couple in the series. I'll probably get the rest, once I prove to myself that I can do what the books tell me I can.If you've ever wanted to find a hobby that allowed you to make things both useful and artistic, casting metal is a good one. As long as you take the time to do things right, you can amuse yourself and amaze your friends.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, was the resources listed in the text weren't always still available, but that's a function of the time since the last update. The interwebs will provide plenty of places to find material and advice."
2,Item NOT as described,"The dimensions given for this are: ""21 by 14 by 16 inches"" I bought this specifically to fit through a 16 1/2"" by 22 1/2"" opening into my attic. This product is actually 19"" by 21"" by 23"" high (with the legs attached, without the wheels, add 1"" for the wheels). The tub is 19"" diameter, nowhere near what they said. I can get it up there by taking it up piece by piece, the tub is 16"" high without the wheels, with the wheels it is 17"". Haven't actually used it yet, the switch seems a little jankey, not as solid feeling as the one on my 18 Gal Shop-Vac. The picture shows a bucket for storing the accessories, this model has knobs to stick the tools in, also did not come with the hose keeper as pictured. The accessories pictured look like my 18 Gal model, very misleading advertising."
5,Phenomenal Vac,I was looking to buy a Dayton brand vacuum until I saw the price. The one I was looking at was 6.5 hp and had vacuum scfm of 210. This vacuum for less than half the price is 6.25 hp and scfm of 190. I'll trade 20 scfm for $120 any day. Excellent vacuum. Only negative is that it doesn't come with the bagless filter for wet/dry. Had to spend an additional $20 on the bagless option accessories. Overall excellent deal either way. Drain on bottom of canister and really long hose are great features too. Can leave vac in other room while vaccing bedrooms (residential).
3,"Good vac, not perfect, but what is?","I am happy I bought this vac. There are some problems that have been plaguing these vacs for years which keeps me from giving it a five star rating. The attachments are consistently coming out of the hose and the hose is constantly pulling away from the vac. The hose itself is made from a material that is slightly harder than it needs to be to keep it from collapsing (due to the suction) and can develop hairline cracks in it over time. In the vacuums defense, however it is stored in very cold temperatures outside in the shed. I suggest buying a role of duct tape with it. The power cord should be a slightly heavier gage wire as it does get quite warm. Still with these flaws and the fact it will be difficult to do better (for the price), I am happy I bought this vac."
4,Good Shop-Vac,"I just received this Shop Vac and at first I was disappointed. After setting it up, I turned it on and had very little suction. I soon discovered that the top of the unit had been damaged in shipment. There was a chunk of plastic broken out of the top of the unit. Since I needed it for an immediate project, I took the broken out piece and epoxy glued it in place and let it set overnight. The next day I turned it on and wow! Very powerful suction. I installed the special cement dust/drywall dust bag and went to work. When attached to my drywall sander it picked up 99% of the drywall dust and it is relatively quite for a unit this size.My concerns are 1. The instruction sheet was very poor - referencing installation and set up parts that were not for this model and 2. The plastic housing is very thin and could crack or break in the future.Overall, I am fairly impressed and hope it will be dependable for years to come."
4,Rich Bass,"When playing an MP3, the bass is notably clear and easy thanks to the neodymium magnets in this little gem of a headset. Add these gags..20mm Headset Microphone Windscreen (6-pack + Securing Ring)..and you have a great system.The cable comes with a kink near the inline volume/mute control. This is caused by a poor packaging design. All the headphones have this problem. None of the sets I own have failed yet because of this, but I'm watching.Probably because these sets have such good audio, they have been discontinued to protect the more pricey headsets on the market. It's the American way.Let's hope somebody copies this design and makes them again."
1,Had a high interest until I read this book,"I run my own shop and wanted to open a new space across town, but rather than rely on a landlord to just give me good terms, I thought I'd do some research first.I started with this book, which promises to show you how to negotiate all the terms, etc. But by the time I'd read the first chapter, my head was nodding and an hour had gone by. I didn't retain any information because it was so dry.I'm sure there's some sort of information to be gleened from it, but you'd have to be a patient reader, not a busy businesswoman like me. I recommend ""The Commercial Lease Guidebook."""
2,Great price if you don't want to listen to it,I bought this radio for my desk at work and that is basically the only reason I'm not returning it - also because it was so inexpensive its not worth shipping back.The sound is tinny and the radio tuning dial is very hard to move. I need to hold it in one hand and move it with the other.It you are only going to listen to this radio for the few minutes each morning when you're alarm goes off then I'm sure its fine for that but if you plan on having it on for any length of time - spend a bit more and get somethig that sounds better.
4,Colorful,"Its an excellent clock, but may not fit all your needs. Has radio (AM/FM), which is a definate plus, and 2 types of alarms with the snooze option. For me its an essential need for waking up on time."
5,CUTE AND COMPACT,"This clock radio is soooo great! It's colorful works very well, and has a sleep timer. I never wake up late anymore to go to school. I love it! The only dissapointment was how Amazon took so long to ship it to me. It took a month and a half. This made me really mad, but at least I have it now."
1,Big Disappointment,"Thie colored cube radio is a total waste of money. There is so much static you can't hear the radio station, that takes 45 minutes to fine-tune in. If you hold the radio at an angle with your right foot pointed south and your left hand raised in the sky it works a little better. I will never buy another GPX product again. My friend's daughter gave her radio to her mom because it was such an aggravation...now my friend is aggravated. We both have them in the office and neither one will stay tuned to a station. You'd think we were in a moving building just going out of range!"
3,Alarm clock radio,The clock is very cute and compact. The radio works well. I could not figure out how to wake to alarm instead of music though. I read the directions over and over and still the music came on instead of just the alarm.
3,Sorry to say this one was not for me,"I have this book on my shelf and have tried to read it a couple times but just can not get into it at all. I am sorry to be hard on this writer but I find that it to predictable, from the hand on the leg under the table to Holly really not knowing who she was. I was most disappoint with this book as I have at least a hundred from NAIAD and several of this authors alone, so I was shocked that I didn't care for this one at all. it was well written as all of her's is but it just wasn't for me."
4,Substitute for Love,"This was my first Karin Kallmaker book and I was not very satisfied like I was with the other books I read of hers afterwards. I guess it was because of the too political and constant struggle of the characters' back stories. It was like a flexed muscle continuously holding that position until the end of the story. The upside of reading this book was that, I got to know about Karin Kallmaker and now I'm hooked with her work."
5,Great,"Holly Markham is straight, isn't she? She's in a controlling relationship with Clay and somehow just can't see it. Then things change for Holly. She resigns from her job to support a colleague over a point of principle. Tori her best friend, takes her to a lesbian dance club where she meets Reyna. A woman of mystery and she falls in love. They have one night together and Reyna tells her that one night now and then is all they can ever have. This isn't enough for Holly. Sex without love is no substitute for love. Holly sets out to find out more about the mysterious Reyna.I enjoyed this book just as much this time as the first time I read it. I like to read an old favorite now and then just so I can relax without the excitement of not knowing what happens."
5,Kallmaker gets better and better...,"Karin Kallmaker continues to amaze me. The books get better and better. In my opinion this book may not be the steamiest, but certainly is the most well written of them all. It has a more complexity in it's story line than most lesbian novels and holds your interest without fail. I can not overlook it's quantity either. How many times have you bought a book that's so thin, with large type, it equals a 30 minute sitcom? This books content is vast for this style of writing. I've always wondered if Naiad had a built in page limit. For once I'll say this is a great one and a half hour movie."
4,Love Karin Kallamker!,"I started with Frosting on the Cake, and now have four of her books. It is easy to get into her storylines and fly through her novels within 2 - 3 days!"
3,Good Reading,Well ladies if you want to forget things for a rainy afternoon get this book. It was a fast read and very enjoyable. The characters were believable and fun. Kallmaker did a good job with this one. Hope you enjoy it like I did.
2,Unbelievable,"If you like your lesbo romances served up unbelievable, dip into this one... you won't be disappointed. Why must all the male characters be jerks? It's already a given we're predisposed to liking women... but must the men be so awful, too? Can't we love women without hating men? And Kallmaker takes me right out of the story by writing the ""Gypsy"" Kings, instead of Gipsy (not just once, but at least three times). This story felt like it was written with a 1950s sensibility. Must we accept such bad writing? If this is the best there is and she's the undisputed queen, our literature is in trouble. For a mainstream novel, try ""The Corrections,"" which has a beautifully rendered lesbian romance that is wholly satisfying (given that the characters don't end up together--something that actually happens in real life).And Naiad, those covers! Really, you diminish the value of your list by putting such terrible covers on your books."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"I couldn't put this book down and read it in one sitting! You will be rooting for these two women, who are drawn to each other at a chance meeting in a bar. They soon realize they are meant to be together but circumstances keep them apart. This is only the second book I have read by Karin Kallmaker and I can't wait to read more. Each character is fighting an inner battle to become who she really longs to be. Work, family and societypressures keep separating Holly and Reyan. I had to keep readingto see how this turned out. This is one book I will read over and over again. You won't be disappointed."
4,Nice sunglasses,"Nice looking,clear view! Only downside is not made for driving as view on the sides is blocked."
2,"Somewhat helpful, but not enough support","I bought this product after injuring my wrist, thinking it would support my wrist during subsequent workouts. Unfortunately, no matter how tight I wrap iot, it stretches too much to give me adequate support.I have found ""wraps"" like boxers use to be much more effective."
5,Love it,"best ever,does the job better then expected, I strongly recommend this filter to every one thanks!.i bought another one as a gift."
1,"More religious junk, less music","Well, I bought this CD bcs of the 2nd song.(slip slide melting).Heard it on the Crow. Strange, it sounded so nice in the movie. I feel so ripped off. This band, and this music is basically for misguided teen jesus freaks more then anyone else.(or anything else for that matter). If you are sane, beyond the mature age of 12 or both you will most likely become very nauseous very quickly. After booting up the CD you'll be quickly drowned in bible transcripts of all sorts. All made to sound like nirvana, but all severely lacking in every single imaginable respect. Be warned."
1,Not a book written by a professional,"As a Mental Health Professional with 20 years of experience working with disturbed youth, this book can be quite problematic as it WAS NOT written by a profession, but a parent. Many people may ""follow"" this path of treatment, but the author left out so many vital pieces of information such as medical conditions, proper evaluations, and all necessary, multi-diciplined treatment approaches. NOT recommended for families having complicated children due to it's biased, parental perspective without scientific research, knowledge or techniques that have been carefully studied."
5,Great book,This is a great book for any one who is adopting or has a child they may think has RAD or any other attachment disorder.
1,not good,Not written by a professional. Where is the respect for the children. Would she like to be treated like this? Look for a book about parenting difficult children that does respect them.
3,Lots of great speed drills,"The lessons are OK. Some of them are pretty elementary, some of them only scratch the surface. The organization of the lessons could use a little work: there is no clear indication as to what ""area"" each exercise should go into. However, if you just used the examples in the book as speed drills, it would be well worth the money for that! There are many examples and the are varied enough to provide a well rounded repository of technique exercises."
2,Ahh such a disappointment,all these reviews got me hyped up about this book...saying its a must have...but im 17 years old...and consider myself in the advanced catagory....the exercises in this book are so elementary its not even funny...i looked at it the day i got it...and havnt looked at it since...its not full of great exercisses..i mean it has some in it..but not enough to advance someone drastically..dont get my wrong..john petrucci is an awesome guitarist..but the book just isnt very impressive...
4,Pretty Darn Good,"All I can say is, when does season II get released on DVD. I'm so looking forward to season two. Somebody please tell me something.Shad in DC"
2,missing subtitles,most disappointed. no subtitles is inexcusable. the show moves fast in the dialogue and one would need those even with perfect hearing.
5,First rate series from a Master,Chris Haddock of Davinci's Inquest has done it again with his signaturehigh quality production of compelling characters in a series with a rivetting story. Nobody who loves Davinci's Inquest will be dissappointed.
5,Gripping viewing!!,"Ian Tracey is brilliant in the lead role in this Canadian series - I was a big fan of Da Vinci's Inquest,in which he also had a major role.His character is 'dark' - I found the 1st Season compelling viewing and can't wait for Season 2 to arrive in the mail!!It will be another VERY late, long viewing session - INTELLIGENCE is like a good book that you just can't put down."
3,Agree re closed captions,"I love DaVinci's Inquest and City Hall, so was happy to check out another Haddock production. A Canadian friend sent me the pilot copied off TV, and there were captions, which I sorely needed (am slightly hard of hearing, but always use captions for fast-paced series with lots of dialogue).I got Season 1 from Blockbuster.com and after watching about 12 hours, I'd say I heard only about a third of the dialogue. I was forced to look up episode guides online and read them before watching each episode, to try to figure out what was happening. Please, Acorn, caption Season 2 when you put it out!"
5,Excellent show,"""Intelligence"" is one of my favorite shows. The main characters, Mary Spalding (Klea Scott), head of the Vancouver Organized Crime Unit, and Jimmy Reardon (Ian Tracey), leader of a local smuggling and marijuana empire, gather and trade intelligence (as in information) to survive and get ahead. Spalding is parleying her network of informants at the Organized Crime Unit into a foreign intelligence service. Reardon aims to hang onto his empire and stay out of jail until he can get out of the smuggling and marijuana business. The writing is great, the characters are strong, and the performances are excellent. The chess games that unfold between the players are complex, compelling and suspenseful--I've never seen another show like it. Some compare it to ""The Wire"", but the central theme is different. ""Intelligence"" really is about intelligence--the characters struggle to get and use information and it's the motor that drives the show."
2,Lifeless,A pretty dull affair. We watched it with our 5 year old boy and he did not have the reaction of the boy mentioned in the other review. Not sure why but there is something seriously lacking in this movie. The animation is sub-par by today's standards and the character's vague and unsympathetic. Not very well done.
2,I Don't Get It?,"This movie was pretty complicated. I mean, I understand what a gnome is, but what's a troll? I sat up all night watching this video film and I just didn't get it. I'd see a few gnomes and go, ""Wow, cool, a gnome, look at him do that stuff,"" and then a troll would come on the screen and I'd go, ""What? A troll? What are you doing? Start doing stuff, I want to see you do stuff,"" and he never seemed to do stuff.If you're an avid fan of gnomes, check out this movie but be ready to fast forward a lot 'cause there is so much troll non-action that will bore you to tears.If you're a fan of trolls, I just want to know why? What does a troll even do? I don't get it. I mean, come on, get real. These trolls were a joke and almost ruined the film. I gave it a two star review because these trolls were dumb. I wish it was called Gnomes and More Gnomes then it'd get five stars."
5,A vital addition to Call of Cthulhu,"90s conspiracy - Cthulhu style. This is simply one of the best sourcebooks for Call of Cthlhu that has ever been released. You need this book. You also need Alien Intelligence, the Delta Green short fiction book, which is incredible."
3,"Geared for teens, but a decent primer on meditation","Because Linda Wasmer Andrews' slim introductory guild to meditation is part of the Scholastic Books, LifeBalance Series, it shold come as no surprise then that this book is geared for a teen audience facing stress at school, home, with friends, etc. Adults looking for an intro to the practice of meditation will also find value with this book - especially if time is of essence being that most readers should be able to get through this book in 1 hour with a significantly better understanding of the basic principles of meditation. Although there are better introductory guides to meditation available parents looking for a book to share with their teenaged kids would be well served starting with this one."
5,Excellent program,"I've had an older version of this program for about 15 years and recently upgraded to Score Writer 4. I am a professional musician, big band, jazz, and dixieland. trumpet and flugelhorn with a degree in Music and have been a working musician since the 1940's..I used the Score Weiter program to prepare a complete library of more than 200 lead-sheets in different keys for a jazz group. The program is outstanding and I recommend it to anyone, due to its ease of use and accuracy. The programmer/creator certainly knew what he was doing.I have no need to upgrade to other, more-expensive, overly-complicated music writing programs. I tried one program and quickly decided that Score Writer was definitely the one best for my purposes.Arden D. MoserAtlanta, Georgia"
5,"Great Reggae-lite album, listenable as Bob Marley's ""Legend""","""Sweat"" reminds me of a cruise I was on and meeting the most beautiful girl in the world while on it. (You reading this Janna?) Sweat and Bad Boys are the known songs but ""Hey Love"" and ""Tear Down These Walls"" are great songs as well. Every song's listenable and catchy. The remix of Sweat mimics the all too common rhythm that Meredith Brooks used in ""Bitch"" and Alanis used in ""You Learn"". Wish the album would bring back the cruise, oh well."
5,2 classics on one CD!,"Motown picked two of the Commodores best for this double CD. It is VERY hard to find!Track Listings:HOT ON THE TRACKS1. Let's Get Started2. Girl, I Think the World About You3. High on Sunshine4. Just to Be Close to You5. Fancy Dancer6. Come Inside7. Thumpin' Music8. Captain Quickdraw9. Can't Let You Tease MeIN THE POCKET10. Lady (You Bring Me Up)11. Saturday Night12. Keep On Taking Me Higher13. Oh No14. Why You Wanna Try Me15. This Love16. Been Loving You17. Lucy"
3,Great Twofer,"It was so great to finally see the Commoddores long OOP Hot On The Tracks availalbe on CD, although it is twofer with In Teh Pocket. Hot On the Track is a classic album featuring my favorite ""Fancy Dancer"" and some other great solos from Lionel. These Motown twofers were issued in the late 80s and early 90s so get this while you can."
5,i hate biggie but i love 2pac,"this movie was great.even in the netherlands we can wacth this movie.i join the makavelli fanclub for 4 jears now.i have seen about six tupac movies.the best was ""poetic justice"" if you wanna anwser this message mail to masterplayah@hotmail"
3,Great with an adjustment...,Had to use pliers to shape it into an L shape because its too small! I have a small nose so its like child sized. Or maybe I just wasn't putting it in right. Who knows. I would recommend L shaped studs..so easy to put in and it doesn't fall out.
2,Needs explanation,"My son who is almost 3 has no idea what this story means. The book shows a hat land on someone but doesn't mention it in the text. Then the person changes into something else but the story doesn't say they switched. Its only fun because my son can relate to some of the animals, but some he's never heard of like the baboon. The story is vague at best and requires so much explanation that it deviates from the story trying to rhyme and provide the concept of magic. My son wanted to read this twice and has never gone back. Glad we borrowed it from the library and didn't purchase. Don't waste your money on this book, so many better choices out there."
4,another good one Mem Fox!,"Another great book by Mem Fox! My daugther really enjoyed this book - she's almost 2.my neice on the other hand (3) found the illustrations a little scary. easy, fun reading!"
4,Love it!!,This book could be used in grades K-3. It is a really excellent book if you want to teach students about prediction of text. Excellent!
1,"great premise, no substance","The reviews were mixed on this book so I decided to order it for my 3 year old since the the rhymes sounded engaging. What a disappointment. The illustrations are hard to follow, especially at the end. The story goes nowhere and is unsatisfying. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Not Much Here...,"I expected a more from Mem after such classics as Koala Lou and Possum Magic but The Magic Hat is simply not magical. It reads like a rough draft of a good premise, a magic hat blows into town and whoever it lands on turns into an animal. The book is written in rhyme but the rhymes are too advanced for it's target audience (Kindergarten, 1st grade). The only way the children figure out what animal the person is going to turn into is by questioning and prompting. Anyway, this is a flimsy effort by Mem that ends in a muddled and confusing manner. Overall, this is one to avoid."
1,Silly Junk,"This book is silly junk. I find few redeeming qualities in it. The events contain magic without making sense, and the story line leads to no relevation and a stupid conclusion. It is a waste of money!"
5,excellent depending on the product,"I have a product solution that does not get caught up in all the windows installation process. we are using these drives like a server and they are fantastic. These are major client applications that have no downtime with these units.Gee no server, windows software, virus software or anything else. For a 3-4 user system again depnding on the software you have it works great.Suggestion though is to use a high gain antenna for best wifi connectivity"
2,Broken after one and half months,Literally one of the worse products I have ever purchased. This watch broke within 60 days of usage. Stay away from this line.
2,Pretty but,"In 3 or 4 days, they are in pieces.They looks pretty but they disarm in pieces with the movement..."
3,Buy from the 'Used and New' merchants.,This GreenPlug energy saver comes with a label that says to make adjustments according to the manual before you plug it in. But there was no manual provided and the supplier was not helpful.I notice that the 'used and new' suppliers are cheaper and ship with manuals. I still think that this is a worthwhile gadget. I am going to return this one and buy from the other guys.I found out when I went on the web that the company that made the plug went out of business probably because the technology started to be built in to newer refrigerators starting in 1992.
3,Intresting little device.,"I inherited my parents 1976, avocado green JC Penny's side by side refrigerator. When they owned it they had to have it serviced nearly every three years for defroster coil replacements. When I got it, in 1991, I stuck it in the basement (cause the wife hated it) and use it as a second frige. At the same time I connected up the Green Plug to the Frige and we have not had any problems since. It does run a little quieter, and cycles on more. The frige and freezer seem colder even though its thermostat is turned down or up. As old as this frige is, it's a power hog. This Frige has been move thrice and keeps on cooling. I think this little device save a little on the power consumption and contributes to the frige's longevity. When we buy a new frige now, they are now more energy efficent than 10 years ago."
3,Forgotten but useful?,"I got one of these at some point in the past, probably the mid-1990's, and used it to power my then-new refrigerator. Recently the fridge started acting up and I had reason to drag it away from the wall; lo and behold there was the GreenPlug, all hairy with dust and mottled with who-knows-what from 15 years of being hidden behind the fridge. I don't know if it helps -- I can't find anything online that tells me what the thing is supposed to do, exactly -- but given that we have had no problems with the fridge in all those years, I'd have to say it doesn't hurt, either. Mine is still 'working' in that I can power the fridge with it, but for now it is back on my workbench awaiting a finding on what it actually does."
5,Exactly What I was Hoping For,"We are adopting from Eastern Europe, and needed something to help us communicate with our son when we travel to meet him and bring him home. I couldn't be happier with this purchase. The cd includes both a male and female native speaker; the phrasebooks (which are small and great for travel) include both the phonetic and cyrillic spelling of the phrases and words. The content includes everything we'll want to tell / ask our son in the first few days that we're trying to communicate - from ""I love you""... to ""this is your new room""... to ""don't be afraid"" ... ""are you thirsty?"" Even my 4-year-old and 5-year-old daughters are repeating the words and phrases. We highly recommend this for English-speaking families adopting or hosting Russian-speaking children."
5,A Must if You're Adopting from Russia,"This is the best book/cd set if you're planning to adopt from Russia or Kazakhstan! You don't have to wade through the ""touristy-type"" phrase books or the more difficult ""academic"" books. If you ARE pursuing an international adoption, you don't have TIME to become a Russian linguist! This set is perfect: the phrases you'll need without all of the ""fluff"" plus the author sends TWO books with the CD so you and your spouse can each study on your own. My wife impressed our Russian hosts on our first trip with how well she was able to speak common phrases. A great product at any price. I'm so grateful to the author for producing this set."
2,2 CD Live - Does not compare to studio recordings,"I find the performances on this pair of CD's not even close in quality to that of the corresponding AC/DC studio recordings (which I am quite fond of). The performances lack musicality and compositional subtlety (substituted here by sheer energy); the vocal and instrumental lines are woefully unbalanced (vocals are overridden). The sonics of the recording, although well engineered, are raucous and too hard-edged."
2,Not a case of Johnson vs. Scott,I think a live album should give you the listener the idea that an audience was actually present.They blanked out the audience noise between each song which helps you lose interest.It's just too polished and professional.I do not own Razor's Edge and judging from how many of the newer songs are on Live I won't be buying that either.
4,Malcolm Fan,"What I like most about AB/CD is the solid rhythm tracks that provide the back bone of this band. Dirty Deeds, TNT, High Voltage and many others have a solid rhythmic riff coming from the rhythm guitar. As a beginning guitar player, it's fun to play along as most of the rhythm guitar parts are relative easy and fun to play.AB/CD doesn't have a ""best of"" CD available so this is about as close as one gets.The sound is good. It's not drowned out by audience noise, and all the instruments are in synch. Even if you already have the studio work, there are some classic jams that make getting this CD worth it. Jailbreak and High Voltage have some extended jam sessions with Malcolm providing the rhythm and Angus gettin' on down on the SG."
4,Figures,It figures that ACDC would play mostly tunes from their latest album The Razors Edge they play 6 songs from it and 1 from Powerage.Probably because Brian Johnsan cant pull of Bon Scott tunes.Thats ok I still like Brian Johnsan a hell of a lot but on a rating of 1-10 I'd give him a 9.9 and Bon Scott a 10.
3,A must for garage fans,"""Psychotic Reaction"" is one of those songs that never seems to die, and turns up on mid 1960s rock compilations far more often than you'd think given that the Count Five were one-hit wonders. Thankfully, most of the rest of this CD is cut from similar cloth. Lots of garage punks tried to emulate British rockers like the Yardbirds, but the Count Five came closer than most. If the production values on this CD were slightly better, it could almost pass for something recorded way back in Swinging London and to be very honest it is no worse (or better) than early LPs by the Kinks or the Dave Clark Five.In other words, this music is pretty darned fun to listen to. Most garage punks made truly awful albums, but this one is a pleasant surprise because the good outweighs the bad. You'll probably eventually go back to listening only to the title song after a few listens, but I think any self-respecting garage punk will want this in their permanent collection. I'm glad I have mine!"
5,Great value!,Thought I would try installing myself. So easy to install and works just as stated. Window glides up and down smoothly. Had replaced same regulator before at shop and paid about $150 for part and that did not even include the labor! This is a great value and the part is good quality.
5,Better Than The Cheaper One!!,"I first purched the ""cheaper"" one on Amazon and do yourself a big favor and spend the little extra money on the Dorman brand - It's the same brand the manufacturer uses and you will have no worries with it. The ""cheaper"" version lasted 2 months before it broke and I couldn't get the cables realigned on the wheels, so avoid the headaches and the extra cost and just spend the few extra bucks up front and get the Dorman Brand!Hope this helps anyone interested."
1,"They sent me a cheap regulator from Taiwan, not a Dorman 741-643","I ordered the Dorman version of this regulator. They are better built but they cost more but the extra price was worth it as I have had the cheaper ones break with-in a year. I was actually sent a cheap Taiwan copy. When I looked up the product number that was on the box on Amazon, that product was selling as the cheaper version on Amazon. I only wanted a Dorman and did not get it and paid extra. I contacted Amazon and got an RA and already sent it back but why should I have to pay the return shipping costs when I did not get what I ordered!!! Be carefull when you order this regulator and make sure its actually a Dorman you are going to get."
2,Steer away,1st one i got had a plastic part broke on it they quickly sent me another one but the motor died in 2 weeks time
3,"Backward, indeed.","Well, I'm very happy to have an operational window again. So far I have not had any problems with the way it's been working. However, I second the other reviewer who stated that the part is backward; down goes up, up goes down. I guess no one else had this problem, otherwise I'd assume it would have been mentioned a few more times on here. Not such a big deal to me, just seems like a bit of false advertising."
1,no quality control,They sent the wrong part and never suggested any remedy but send it back. It cost over $10. to return the useless part. This was a very disappointing experience.
3,"Good, but backward","In my research, the cheapest combination of part and seller was the Dorman regulator off Amazon. So, that's good. After installing and using the regulator for two weeks, I have two issues:1. The proportions of the regulator were slightly different than the OEM regulator, so that when the rear end of the window was completely raised, there was still a slight gap at the front end. In order to fix this problem, I drilled out one of the bolt holes so I could slide the front cable track further up.2. The wiring harness was wired backward, so that up goes down and down goes up. I decided to live with this rather than go through the hassle of repurchasing and reinstalling.(I will update this review when I have a sense of the longevity of the part.)Overall, it's a good cheap solution, but I encountered several issues that make it feel very cheap."
2,Didnt fit,"I bought this product for my oldsmobile alero because the plastic piece on the original one broke off. amazon said it would fit my car but was 5"" to short to fit so i took the piece off and put it on the original regulator and it worked fine"
4,Comprehensive,"I found this book to be very helpful in studying for the mcat. However, if you have not had basic chemistry, organic, biology, and physics as a foundation, you might find some of the concepts difficult to understand - this is supposed to supplement and direct your knowledge, not teach you everything you need to know for medical school. It told me which subjects were stressed more than others and I used the practice problems, as well as old exams from my college courses to brush up on my problem-solving skills which certainly helps give you extra time for concept and analytic/data interpretation problems. Hint: practice the essays and ask a teacher to critique them for you, because when crunch time comes you need to get the job done, writing DETAILED and COMPLETE essays that should be at least 1.5 pages. It is not enough just to read the writing section."
5,Awesome Text,"I wish I had this book when I was still un undergrad. student. After taking a course with Princeton Review(totally waste of time) and before taking the real mcat, I bought this book for extra practice. This book was easy to read with lots of neat tips. Even the test questions were similar to those on my actual mcat, unlike the crap on the Princeton Review practice tests. Practice questions at P.R. were so out of whack b/c they they had to be different from other testing publishers(kaplan, colombia, arco, etc.m,)No, I dont work for Princeton Review but I highly recommend this book to anyone."
4,good marine plug,Replaced old spark plugs with these. Motor runs fine. It does start faster. Can't go wrong with Champion spark plugs.
4,Interesting book,"This book was easy to read and interesting. A touch political at times, but overall I would recommend it.l"
3,Having trouble finishing,"I've read other books on the Kennedys and I'm having trouble getting through this one. Not really sure why. It's not bad, but it isn't new information for me so I'm just bored with it. If you haven't read other books about Camelot, you'll probably enjoy this book."
2,Good But Not Worth Purchasing Over Other Books- Read Review,"I have read many books on Jackie and Jack Kennedy. This one is no different from the many others that have been published in the last three or four years. It tells us stuff we aready know and flips it. It states that some information printed in the past praises the Kennedy's too much or too little. It is true that too many books seem to either portay the couple as extreemly sad and unattached to one another or in love w/ minor problems.This book seeks to show a complet picture, which it does. It's just that it says nothing new, nothing making it worthy of purchasing. I recommend that you download the audio version b/c it's cheaper and much more pleasent way to read this book.Instead of this book buy ""America's Queen"", ""Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis: A Life,"", and ""Mrs Kennedy: The Missing History of the Kennedy Years:"
2,High Society,"If you want to know who comes from old money and who from new, this is your book. You have to be obsessed with the society of a rarefied world to be interested in the pages and pages of minutiae detailed in this book. I don't think it enhances the reputations of either of the Kennedys and I'd rather not have known this much about their ""private world."" I'd rather read about the more substantial aspects of their lives. Perhaps that's already been done enough, but Smith doesn't add that much new - despite the billing - she just focuses on the minutiae more than has been done before."
1,Grace and Power,This is not large print as advertisedThis is not large print as advertisedThis is not large print as advertisedThis is not large print as advertised
5,A crystal clear perspectiveof Hitler's primary motives.,"This would be the ideal ""package"" for anyone who is interested in what Hitler's motives were. A totalitarian who used glorious nostalgia to express his ideas to the people of Germany in the 1940's.This movie is the best documentary on the Third Reich. The director does not take a biased view but rather takes a blatant approach to describing Hitlers frightening plans to create a fantasy like German nation.The movie is perfect for college courses."
3,"First half excellent documentary, 2nd half not good","This documentary offers an excellent look at the influence of the arts, and medicine and eugenics on the minds of the hierarchy of the Third Reich. Combined with rare footage, and learned commentary, the film shows the influence of the architecture and style of classical antiquity, and the yearning to create a perfect 'man' in the Greek sense of the word. One of the memorable quotes I remember from the movie is how Hitler wanted his cyclopian buildings and stadiums to stand the test of time, and even when in ruins and covered in ivy, would reflect the greatness of a former civilization. Now that's thinking ahead!Unfortunately, the second half of the documentary takes a left turn into holocaust propaganda territory, leaving the viewer wondering if two different people wrote the first and second hour, as it has little to do with the overall subject matter, and lacks the objectivity and factual care of the first half."
4,Very good,"At first I was a little bored with this video because it was a little slow, the narrator was not as good as ones that host History Channel documentaries and the narration script was below average. But the footage is very rare and the video gets very in-depth with regard to Hitler's obsession with art and his plan to create a new art culture for Germany. I didn't know he was this enthralled with architecting a new society to the point of deciding which art was good for the country and which was bad and what art should be destroyed. Goes into good detail about how the history and mechanisms for extermination of Jews were slowly developing. I learned a great deal. Well worth the time and money."
1,Drink lots of coffee before watching this.,I am a student of third reich history and when I heard of the release of this film I managed to see it at an independent theatre. While there is a great deal of interesting documentary footage and fair analysis this has got to be about the dullest documentary I have ever seen. There is no style to the directing or editing. The narration is even worse. The good points are negated by the overall stale production. This is certainly not a film to even rent let alone purchase. (Unless you are an insomiac.)
3,"Not as good as ""Back in Town""","Most of the material is very old and very ""clean"" - from a time before Carlin really hit his comedic stride. Unless you're a die-hard fan, try ""Back in Town"" instead."
2,not that good,"George's classic work was probably better when it was created. Even though the topics he discusses are still valid, his style and delivery back then was just too wordy and slow for today. Comics like Jerry Sienfeld and Dana Carvy pack way more laughs per sentence. The only bit on this CD that comes close to current standards is ""seven words..."". And Carlin's more recent work is much faster paced and concentrated with humor. Buy this CD if you're a true Carlin fan and want to relive the old days, but buy his newer work if you want to laugh really hard."
3,ok for the money,The 1 inch tweeters are not loud at all.I had to go buy better ones but the 5 1/4 sounds good tho. i guess this is one of those you get what you pay for...lol
4,Good but not Great,"This component speaker set is a pretty good little set for the price. Once installed, it is one heck of an improvement over my 23 year old blown pickup speakers. I'm hooking these up to an older Panasonic head unit with 50w x 4 channel, Peak 22w x 4 channel RMS power. Wiring was a pain in the butt, the wires on the tweeters were a little short to work with, but the product box contained extra runs of wires. I had to get creative with a soldering iron and some electrical tape. Sound quality is good, however, it is not top quality. These speakers are worth what I paid for them, nothing more.Pro's:Good PerformanceGreat PriceAll of the wiring you need with EXTRA wiresCon's:Not high quality sound or componentsShort wires on the tweetersOverall:Good set of component speakers, not the highest quality. Sound could be better. But for what I paid for them, I'm not complaining."
1,"Not as advertised, sound is terrible","Buyer beware! Reviews must be coming from manufacturer. The speakers are 25 watt total combined power, 12 watts each! Very cheap product made in Taiwan where apparently you can print any information on the packaging regardless of how grossly inaccurate it is. I didn't really pay attention to the specs printed on the speakers, connected them and couldn't figure out why they sounded like a cheap transistor radio from the 70's. I went to an installer to see what I had done wrong and he pointed out that they were of very low wattage and were a terrible product. I am returning, will be much more cautious about believing reviews on Amazon."
1,Pyle of Crap,These speakers fell apart shortly after install and quickly became worse than my broken OEM ones. Spend a little more and get better quality that will last. You dont want to have to rp off your door panels every year to change these out. Do the job once with better speakers.
2,Good idea...but not good quality!,"I bought these bits because I was replacing a friends decking and I wanted a new set. The quick connect appealed to me because with the decking, I needed to change between drilling and screwing repeatedly. The quick connect system was great for this.However, the smaller drill bits all broke after about 30 holes drilled. The quick connect at the base of the smaller drill bits makes them pretty weak and the drill bit sits quite a ways out from the drill chuck because of the quick connect set which puts them under extra tension. And both the P2 drill bits broke after about 50 screws each. They just sheered off at the top.Now I realise that doing decking is a pretty intense job (I drilled and screwed about 2000 holes) and I shouldn't have gone for a cheap set. I'm sure if you're just looking for a set to keep around the house for odd jobs here and there, they would be great."
1,Drill bit broke after one use.,"I am very disappointed in the quality of this product. I was pre-drilling holes in wood to complete a project and the 1/8 drill bit broke off into the wood.I have never had this happen while using a drill. I am not a professional, however I use my drill very often in diy projects. This was very disappointing. I will not be purchasing black and decker in the future."
2,Bits Wobble,I purchased this to go along with a Black and Decker drill that I gave as a gift. I have the old style Black and Decker drill with the built in quick connect and I love it. I wish they had not discontinued it. My one issue with this set (and its a big problem) is that the adapter that holds the bits in place allows for a lot of wiggling. The bits do not spin true. I returned the first set I ordered thinking it must be defective but the replacement set had exactly the same problem.
3,left something to be desired,"This set is great fro what's there. My beef is that in the 10 piece multi-purpose set, there are only 7 different bits as three of them are duplicated. Buying this on-line I didn't notice that. As a 27 piece set I would give it 5 stars, but since it's not really what it claims to be, I was a bit disappointed."
1,Coffee,"I wanted Superior Coffee Cafe Royal Ground Regular Gourmet Coffee, 1-1/2oz Packets, 42/carton. What I received instead was from PLEXSUPPLY.COM. DOWE EGBERTS RED RIBBON BLEND COFFEE, 1-1/2oz packets, 42/carton.My order should have been sent to someone that handles Superior Brand Coffee, but was sent to Plex Supply three times. I never did get Superior Coffee Cafe Royal... I finally gave up on it, I sure wish I could have gotten what I wanted though, I really wanted to try it."
3,Smaller than the picture,"You should be cautious that this sign is much smaller than what the picture shows. It is not very noticeble from distance. The design is fine. I just hope it can be bigger. By the way, I bought it with around $30. I think it is a little overpriced because it is lightweight."
5,John Nettles is the Best,"What can one say? This is a terrific Series. The acting is wonderful...and showing the family life in-between the ""murders"" gives a feeling a reality. Cannot say enough about this set...except to say I have watched it three times!!"
5,Wrong information on Editorial Reviews / Product Description,"The list of episodes in the Editorial Reviews / Product Description is simply wrong.Rightly, series 5 contains these episodes:*Tainted Fruit*Ring Out Your Dead*Murder On St. Malleys Day*Market For Murder*A Worm In The Bud"
2,"Defective ""Faithful Unto Death"" disc","I chose this rating out of frustration. The set 5 played very well except for Faithful unto Death. I'm sure the tape was never reviewed before sale. The disc stops then skips to another section of the story. I watched it later on Netflix to see the part I missed. i then hunted Amazon for a single disc sale for that episode without success. I can't see returning the entire package for one tape. Eventually, I'll probably replace the whole thing with an Early Cases package but can't do it now because of other expenses Anyway, I was disappointed in this sale"
3,beautiful,"I love an English mystery, so I tried this. I was interested in what an earlier mystery would be like. The scenery is very beautiful, and so like the England I knew. However, compared to the mysteries of today, I found it to be a little mild. But, I watched it twice and ordered another, so it must be appealing!"
3,The first record by the almighty Clutch,Was expecting better but was not bad. A bit more raw than much of their other stuff.
4,Back when Clutch was still considered metal,"This is actually my least favorite Clutch album, but still a good effort, and the album that paved the way for Clutch to become what they are today. Great!There are some really good songs on the album. My personal favorite is ""Milk of Human Kindness"", which is just awesome. That song was actually used for their music video debut. I remember seeing it on MTV back when videos were still MTV's bread and butter (it a either on headbangers ball, 120 minutes, or both).Anyway, a worthy addition to any Clutch collection."
4,great album.,"This cd is a great album in many respectes. The songs on the album that define it are: A Shogun Named Marcus, Binge and Purge, 12 Ounce Epilogue, Bacchanal, Heirloom, Effigy. there are some cool one liners in tracks: Binge and Purge, Effigy. Over-all this album is right on the money if yo like a slow bass metal. This album doesn't have the slickness of the Clutch sell tited album but is not a bad album."
5,LUSCIOUS EXPERIENCE!!,Anyone who liked the second Clutch title will dig this.It has its aggressive moments and its calm groovy moments.This cd definitely has some one liners you wont forget.Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to an earful of this creamy goodness.
4,The oddball of aggro metal,"On this debut album, Clutch play Pantera-style power-groove metal with growled vocals. Leadoff track, ""A Shogun Named Marcus"" is a kickass, propulsive groove, rocking harder than this band ever would again. ""Binge and Purge"" is also cool, with a mosh-crazy ending that seemingly pokes fun at the macho aggressiveness of this style. Elements of funk are scattered throughout this otherwise pounding mosh album. The lyrics are pretty humorous, engaging in storytelling as opposed to the angst of most other similar bands."
3,Rage Muzak,"Clutch as a band is excellent. However, this album is probably my least favorite of the lot. It's good in its own strange way, and if you're mad at the world, this will help you express your rage. It's a lot more metalic than the later Clutch CD's, and the lyrics are Rage as opposed to the strange and amusing lyrics that came on the later albums, but over all still a decent CD. My advice is to buy the other albums before this one unless you're really down with the whole 'rage' thing~~"
5,Thousand pictures worth a million words.,"That's what you get, a bunch of pictures. I think this is even better than having a video, because you have all the movement frames on one page."
1,Tells nothing unless you are a beginer!!,"I expected something like Caro's book of tells. What I got was about 3 tells and the rest was the rules for begginers. I was really disapointed.ps.Phil Hellmuth sucks and his book for ""professionals"" is a begginer book too."
1,Boring,"I have watched a lot of poker DVDs and this one has got to be the most boring one yet. While Howard is a great poker player he just does not have the personality to make an interesting DVD. While the information is good for beginners, there are many other DVDs out there that will teach you more and be more fun to watch."
5,Wish everyone would watch this video!,"This is a great DVD for the novice poker player! The DVD is professionally recorded and provides clear instruction on no limit hold 'em, and a few tricks of the game. Also provided is a chart with strategy, odds and positional advice. This DVD definitely helped my game and my wallet. I'd recommend it to anyone who is learning the game and wants to learn a good, conservative strategy."
2,Howard Lederer Doesn't Tell All,I was expecting a video on tells. WRONG. This is for beginners who want to learn the game of Texas Holdem not for advance players. The few Tells he says are the same everyone says in their video. The title is miss leading. I even fell asleep while watching the video. Not worth watching unless your new to the game!!!
1,Don't bother,"This video spends about 10 minutes on tells, all of which are excepts from Howard's first two DVD's. The rest of the DVD are excerpts from ""Secrets of No Limit Hold Em"" and cover basic play, pre-flop, flop, turn, and river strategies. Don't waste your money if you have the other DVD's. If you really want the goods on how to play limit and no-limit poker, buy Phil Hellmuth's book, ""Play Poker Like the Pro's."" I've made money using his strategies."
1,Disappointing & Misleading,"Very misleading title, less than 10 minutes are spent on tells, the rest merely repeats material from his first DVD. Don't buy this if you own his other DVD's."
1,No Tells Here--Save your money,"This DVD gave about 5 tells in the begining of the disc. After that, he explains how Hold em is set up and played. What a waste of money. Why would you title the DVD ""tells"" if you spend 5 minutes on it and the rest is on how holdem is played with a few basic concepts. I mean this is total nonsense. i only gave it a 1 star because its the lowest i can give. Would like to give a neg rating if i could. Total bummer mannn..."
1,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!,This DVD is a complete waste of time and money. It gives you no useful tips and will not help your poker game whatsoever! Do not get bluffed out of your money by Howard Lederer!
1,This DVD itself is a bluff,"Garbage, everything repeated from the first DVD for beginner, it's an exact copy, I have all 4 series. If you're going to start like a beginner, get the ""secret"" and ""more secret"" one and you're done, don't waste money on this one."
1,Waste of money if you have the first 2 DVDs...,This is just a recutting of the first two DVD's in this series (Howard Lederer's Secrets and More Secrets of No-Limit Hold'em). Since I already own both of these it was a complete waste of money for me. There is absolutely NO NEW MATERIAL on this DVD. If you don't already own the first DVD you could get this instead but you'll still need to buy the second one.
3,"SHC: Research, yes, but let's not jump to conclusions...","The books starts off well, promising to investigate other hypotheses, but quickly jumps to the conclusion that Spontaneous Human Combustion is the only possibility. It would have been better if it had spent more time looking at how a body could possibly burn like that and less time claiming that it must have combusted by itself. I would have rated the book higher if it hadn't been for the sorry attempt to link in the ""Philadelphia Experiment"" fable while searching for causes of this yet unproven phenomenon. On a positive note, it does have a very good list of alleged occurances of SHC, with enough details to allow further research."
2,my advice,"well, my only advice on buying these things is DON'T!! this ipod look-a-like gave me nothing but truoble..it was a waste of time trying to fix all of its glitches. a waste of money basically. eventually i got fed up and bought an ipod..so much better."
3,Pretty Good,I didn't get my MP3 player how it looked like on the picture. I thought it was like the iPod were you get to use the click wheel but it works good and it has a nice sound quality.
3,Pretty Good,"I was just looking for something to play music on and it does a pretty good job. I am not about to spend $2-$300 on a mp3 players regardless of what it does. This machine maybe a little fragile, but it dam sure get the job done. I can play up to 500 different songs. I am not looking for anything else for awhile. This is a great replica of the IPOd."
1,VPOD Nano Super Slim 2GB MP3 MP4 Video Player,Wasn't worth the money. Very disappointed. The software was all in Chinese.
3,It is not 2GB MP4!!!,"This is 512M mp4 player, please make sure you read the comments under thedescription."
1,THis is the worst MP4 / MP3 player I have ever used,This item is impossible to use. It is not user friendly and there is NO figuring it out. The product manual sent with it is a joke. I am not one of those people who can't use or make electronics work. It was a Christmas gift and I can't send it back since it was purchased more than 30 days ago. I am literally throwing it away - as well as the $60.00 I spent!
1,Horrible,"Don't waste your money like me. It's a horrible product. Not user friendly and difficult to understand manual, even the software is a piece of junk."
3,not as awesome as I had hoped,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son a year or two ago. An Ipod was high on his wish list but there was o way I could afford one at the time. And then I found this and it fit into my budget perfectly. Needless to say, my son was thrilled when he opened this gift. It's still his favorite gadget, but the charger fits very loosely so we have to fight to get it to charge. And when we finally manage that, it doesn't hold the charge long. Also, I'm technologically illiterate and had to have a friend put music on this because it didn't come with clear instructions on how. All in all it's worth what I paid for it."
3,Cheap price...and I got what I paid for. Dissatisfied.,"I bought this as a gift for my teen son. It seemed rather nice at first, he was content with it, but it didn't take long before the ear plug hole gave out and he could no longer use the device without a lot of wiggling of the cord to hear. He quickly became very unsatisfied with his gift."
1,So disapointed....,"This is a imitation product. Not user friendly and Crap for User manual. NOT RETURNABLE. in the user manual, which has alot of mispelled words and typos, it states to visit their website...but it doesnt indicate where that is, nor can i find one on the net. the problem is there is no ""brand"" indicated anywhere on the box it came in or the machine its self... that should have been my first clue. If this product is malfunctioning and needs to be returned to the manufacturer, youll have to send it to china! all the software that came with it is in chinese as well."
1,2GB Super Slik MP3 MP4 Video Player,"This item came with an instruction book that was loosly translated from Chinese to English. Very hard to understand how to operate. Not user friendly item. I purchased two for my kids at Christmas and by the end of January, both of their screens shattered! Seller unresponsive to make restitution. Buyer beware!!!"
1,This thing SUCKS,"When I first got this mp4 player, It worked pretty well with the acception of low volume. But after about 3 weeks it stopped working.It kept saying the battery was low after being charged over-night."
1,The worst mp3/mp4 video player,this is the worst mp3/mp4 video player ever!!!!!!! don't get it especially if its from china..it's only a rip off..i got mine for about 5 days and it has stopped working..then a hourglass pops up and doesn't go away..i would give this a -10 rating..don't buy.you'll just get ripped off..save ur money for better things!!!!
1,Have not received this item,"I have not received this item or any information on this order being at the post office. Today is a holiday and I will check the post office again tomorrow. As of this date Jan. 15, 2007 I have not received this item or any information on this item.I understand that it was suppose to be delivered to the post office before Christmas but I have received no information from the post office on this item."
2,"Plays alright, but so far it's a pain to navigate...","I have the 2GB...It plays fine, but I'm having trouble navagating it and the manual is worthless. Anybody know how to create a playlist for the transfer? It's a royal pain to scroll song by song thru everything!"
1,The VPOD is not working now. I purchased it some 2 months back,"The VPOD looks good and it was working ok, but doesnt have that utility as mentioned by the seller. Now after 2 months, its not working."
1,dont waste your money,"I purchased this item for my daughter as a Christmas gift it did not work right from the minute she used it would turn itself off randomly even though it was fully charged, she could not view her song list while a song was playing and the plug is smaller than all other mp3 players so you have to either buy an adapter or only use with ear phones provided we retuned it and bought a Sandisk sdmx4-2048 it works great suggest you do the same and avoid the hassle"
1,TERRIBLE BUY!,"Don't get this mp3 player!! It broke less than a week after I ordered it. I got messages from the computer saying the music I loaded wascorrupted and unreadable, and also the headphone jack only sent music out to one earphone. The video was blurry and grainy as were the pictures, and everything was generally cheaply made. I'm suprised at Amazon, they usually sell good stuff.If you want a good inexpensive mp3 player, then buy a Sandisk Sansa."
1,Dark mode doesn't work,I don't have any web link for this product for technical support or firmware upgrade.The dark mode doesn't work and the battery last maximum one hour with the display on.Also the date and time is reseting after switch off.Any suggestion?Thanks a lot.Nicolai
1,Poor,"Dispite wery good look it`s hard to use (complicated manual, menu button,soft need a lot of work-intrferens with other programs)"
1,THE V POD SUCKSSSSSSSSSSS,The first day i got the Vpod it worked fine. I was disappointed because its so much smaller than the pictures make it look. U would think its just like an Ipod. IT ABSOLUTELY STINKS! THE BUTTONS DON'T WORK NOR DOES THE MUSIC PLAY! I'M ANXIOUSLY AWAITING A REFUND!!!! PLEASE DON'T WAISTE UR HARD EARNED MONEY OVER THIS Bull.!!!
1,Donot buy this item!! It come from China!,"This mp3 player not a real one. It work bad!! Not worth to buy. We can check on Ebay, it come from china.Not Good1!!!"
1,customer service number?????,does anybody know how i can contact the company directly. does somebody have a number to call so that i can return this item? this item sucks.
1,bad bad bad,Yes the look and feel of and i-pod. To bad it does not also have the quality and reliability. Do not buy this product. It has a major design flay in the actual music plaler conection. If you want to put files on it you must hold in the jack really hard and that is time consuming and anoying. If you dont think that is so bad you must do the same thing to charge it. This cheap nock off has ruend my fath in jeneric brands.
2,most confusing player ever,"I recently purchased this mp3 player and although the reviews were mixed, mostly bad, i figured since im rather tech savvy and so is my boyfiend, that loading wouldnt be a problem. Well it was. BIG TIME. putting music on it was fine, but when it came to videos, they wouldnt work. the device comes with a disk so u can download a converter and that still wouldnt work, so after 2 hours of fiddling with it and trying every possible way, and the instruction booklet that came with it doesnt say not one damn thing about music or video transfer, it kept reffering to the converter which would say it had converted the videos but really hadnt. so if youre looking for an Ipod nano wannabe go right on ahead but i am severely pissed that i took a chance and got burned."
2,Too Good to Be True!,"It's difficult for me to write this review because I'm all for affordable generic products that 'try' to do as well as the big brand names (ipod). However, this one is too far from reality, so many things need changed. from the user's guide, the navigation buttons, to the battery life... for me that was it: battery life less than 4 hrs! average 2.5 hrs actually. WHat kind of portable mp3 player you need to recharge every 4 hrs? (maximum). Then the usb went bad, one end broke... I got a more affordable, rather simple, but enough for what I need... sandisk e130."
5,MIDWEST BOOK REVIEW,"What a great book, not only was it a wonderful read, but I got to enjoy a pleasantodor each time I picked it up.OK, what am I talking about right? Dr. Hirsch's book ""Life's a Smelling Success"" is about smells, yes you read that right, andwill you be surprised how your nose can help you in your everyday life.Dr. Hirsch explains how certain smells help you remember things like birthdays, what you need to buy at the store, and will even unlock your mind to memories that you felt were forever gone.Want to relieve stress, or sleep better? How about this, want to use your sense of smell to curb your appetite? The answer lies in the pages of this delicious smelling book. I'm serious, you will just have to run out and buy yourself a copy and begin to sniff your wayto success.Thank you Dr. Hirsch, I assure you that I will be using much of what I have learned from your informative book.Great read! Highly recommended!"
1,Fake reviews here.,"Fake reviews here. All effusively positive without giving away (gasp) ANY of the scents. Reads like an ad just trying to build and build your desire. ""What if there was a scent that could make you alert but calm. Wouldn't you want that. I'm not going to say what it is... you'll have to buy the book hehe."" I call BS. Anyone this dishonest cannot be trusted in their research results. Thought about buying the book but these four fake reviews have stopped me (one of them is even the exact same fake review from two different login names)."
1,Old cars not life of roll or royce.,A bunch of old cars. Unless you want to know about these old relics don't purchase. It is not a biography!
5,Lined pole Top Drape Set,matched our bedspread and throw pillowsbought the comfort several years ago so was surprised I could find matching curtains
1,dangerous,I love the color. that is why I bought it. I had it for 2 months. There is just a tiny plastic piece which hooks over the top of the glass caraf from the handle. no more than 1/2 inch square. this is all that holds the glass carafe onto the top of the pot. It broke off. very dangerous with a whole pot of hot coffee. The bottom of the handle stayed attached but is VERY loose with out the top being attached also..
1,Not good,"I bought this coffee maker because of it's color.I used for 7 months, and then it went dead.I won't recommend it to anyone..."
3,It's an OK modem but nothing great,I'm only writing this review to point out that the Windows 2000 driver works just fine and dandy.I'm using it with XP to write this because I'm without broadband for a few weeks.If the guy doing the griping about XP had actually done any serious searching he couldn't have helped but find that out himself.It would have been impossible not to find that info with any effort at all.Waaaa!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Don't buy this if using XP or MCE2005,"I bought this modem based off the ""G. Ciaramitaro"" review above. I'm a smart guy and can find drivers for it somewhere I thought. Wrong. All the locations listed above have moved on to other (more recent) model drivers.Over the last 2 days I have yet to find a driver that works. Thinking it may be the modem, I tried it on a buddy's Win98 box. Worked great there with the supplied driver.Best data tech support was useless.If you're using XP or MCE, don't waste your time with this modem. The frustration is not worth saving a couple bucks."
4,Journeys Never End,"If you are a moderate to hardcore TNG fan, I think you'd really like to have this video as part of your collection. A video like this is particularly good to have for future years, so you can take a quick journey back into the show. The video isn't very long, but it does offer a wide range of video clips and cast interviews. This tape was made prior to the final episode of the series, so they do focus a fair amount of time to discussing ""All Good Things..."" (series finale). My only complaint is that there isn't much emotion involved in the tie up. This type of video could have come at the conclusion of any season. I was hoping for a little more depth in the cast interviews, but it's still an enjoyable piece of nostalgia."
1,Instant doesn't mean 15+ seconds!,A kitchen thermometer really only needs three things to be good:Easy to readSimple to useQuick and accurate readingsSadly this thermometer doesn't have all of those three characteristics. When you first stick the probe into the product it gives you a low temperature reading. Then every 1-2 seconds the temperature climbs. It takes 15+ seconds to finally get the thermometer to climb in very small increments at which I'm assuming it's close to the real temperature. It's frustrating to deal with especially if you have many things going on at once while cooking.I would not advise anyone to buy this thermometer.
3,Won't stay on Fahrenheit,"Reads quickly, but you have to know your Centigrade conversions, because if you release the C/F button, it reverts to Centigrade. Be careful about getting the housing close to the heat. The plastic melts easily."
2,Very slow,"This thermometer takes 20+ seconds to come up with a stable reading, much longer for higher temperatures. My old thermometer (discontinued) would read in less than 5 seconds, so there IS something better out there."
1,not so instant or reliable,"Was getting into grilling and so wanted to get an instant read thermometer, the price seemed right so got this one. problems from the get go. Hard to turn on and off, VERY slow to get to full INSTANT temp, cheap platisc that is too vulnerable to heat and moisture. Died much too soon due to the insides getting rusted out, turns out this device is not even moisture resistant. Big disappointment, so it's back to the drawing board"
2,Instant? No. Accurate? Yes.,"I tested this against boiling water, and accounting for elevation, it was only 0.3F off. However, it does not live up to the ""instant read"" part of its name. It takes a minimum of 32 seconds to stabilize at the correct temperature. Due to that, and the lack of automatic shutoff, it gets two stars. Accurate marketing to match the accurate readings would have gotten it a higher rating."
3,a little disappointing,"At first I loved it, as it switched from C to F degrees, but by mistake, I dropped it in the jam, and it no longer would switch to Farenheit, so I ordered a new one, and that wouldn't turn off....it was on when it arrived, and I suspect the battery will run down soon...so I'm not as happy as I should be with it."
2,You can't realistically fly at night with just this unit,"I'm an amateur RC pilot and found it almost impossible to fly with this unit at night. It's just too hard to keep your orientation. I've only used it once. After a very short flight I was lucky not to lose the plane and have it fly off into the night. The problem is that the lights are too close together to keep your orientation. If they were spread apart on the wings it might be a different story.I think the fact is that night flying is very hard and really should only be attempted by an expert. But seeing as how most people using the unit are beginners or amateurs, night flying is probably out of their league.Great idea, but simply not realistic. Expect to be disappointed and probably lose your plane."
5,A fun book for sure!,"I was really fond of this book! It had enough story and plot going on that I didn't feel like I was sitting around reading porn but it focused enough on the romance-y stuff enough that I didn't feel like I was reading something for an English class. A nice balance I think. Definitely be aware though, Shiek's story and plot line are strong present throughout. So if horses and Derby Day and all that aren't your thing, you may wanna skip. Overall though, a good book that I enjoyed thoroughly.The only objection I had was to the kindle formatting. The way the text shifted around on my kindle app was a bit wonky and there were some obvious typos that I'm sure weren't in the print version."
1,Did not enjoy at all.,Mostly about two people battling over a horse. Very boring with little to no actual chemistry between the two main characters. Not my idea of a good read.
2,Memorex MD688503,"This wasn't worth what I paid for it, and I had free shipping on it. It's decent if you don't use it much, but I frequently use this item when I jog or in my pickup because it doesn't not have an onboard CD player. The headphones with it are horrible, and the little plastic window over the CD comes out if you aren't careful with it. The skip protection is decent, and the AM/FM digital tuner has decent range of reception. Overall, it's not a very good product."
2,Messy Publishing,"I thought this book was ok. The story line was great but it's sad when the publishing co doesn't care what they put out. I can't imagine a company would put out a book with such a great story line and have it loaded with typing errors. If I were the author I'd be disgusted, embarrassed and change companies. It is truly sad that we readers pay for a book and have to dissect 85% of the book to understand it. It took me 2 weeks to read this book, only because I was tired of reading errors along the way. The longest it normally takes me is 1-2 days with a good book."
4,Real Stuff,"This was a great read, I couldn't put it down. I read in two days! The only gripe I have is the book was published in 2005 and they leave you hanging. There should be another book by now since I'm just reading it in 2007. Where you at! Get it popping Eric"
3,Great game but Windows 7 beware,"I bought this game a couple days ago and was really excited since I used to play it when I was a kid. I popped the disk in and it installed just fine and all the codes were there. Unfortunately, I played the game on my relatively new Dell laptop and it would not show any of the menus or videos. I scourged the internet for a solution but could not find one. I tried running it in compatibly mode but that did not work either. I got around it because every time you go back to windows and return to the game you can see the menus. This is quite a hassle and for first timers it would suck because you cant see the videos, which are actually quite entertaining. Again, great game and no blame to the seller but just beware if you have windows seven."
5,AWESOME GAME,This is an awesome game I just got it 3 weeks ago and i love it.It has some of the best graphics everand the gameplay is great.Multiplayer is very fun. You can even chat with your opponet.Yuri's revenge is good and you can use yuri.IT is a great strategy game. You will instantly become hooked.
2,50% Good,"All I have to say is when you order the ""pack"" make sure they send ALL the serial codes to load the game! Spent the money got the games but received only one serial code for the pack (Red Alert 2). Yuri's revenge required a separate code which was not included, so now I can enjoy half the game and use the Yuri's Revenge disk as a coaster or maybe a colorful mini-frisbee!"
4,I love it.,"I've known about Cassie since she was just a model on myspace who recorded a few songs. It's soooo awesome to see how far she has come. My faves on the album are...""Long Way To Go"" - The beat is hott. I love Ryan Leslie for this one.""Just One Night"" - This song has been around for awhile and I've always loved it. It's always been my fave Cassie song.""Miss Ur Touch"" - Just like the previous song, this one has been around for awhile. It's pretty short but I love singing.""What Do U Want"" - Cassie had a video on her site of her making this song and I fell in love with it then. I'm happy to finally hear the final song and I love it sooo much. It's probably my fave right now.Overall, we all know Cassie is not the strongest singer. But these days to be a singer, you don't have to be able to sing. Her songs are catchy and the album is fun to listen to."
2,Not So Good,"I had high hopes for this CD with the chart topping single: ""Me & U"" - which has a very catchy R&B;/techno/hip hop beat to it.This CD disappoints from the start with the exception of maybe 1 or 2 songs.Cassie, a former model, has a marginal voice (at best) that is not good enough to carry her through these songs. It's too high pitched and she is basically ""cooing"" her way through each and every song. She has no range to her voice what so ever. There is not one song where she belts on (I don't think she can).The music, production and beats on these songs gets so repetitive that you have to stop it midway through the CD (if you make it that far). They all have the same beat as ""Me & U"" but they all tend to seem a bit casio-keyboard-ish...hence, almost to the point of sounding generic.I really gave this CD a chance and WANTED to like it but, I can't. I would save your money for one of the MANY CD's that are about to drop in the months to come!!!"
5,Album that hits each level of greatness,"Can't believe it. Finally an album that has a hit song every time you hit next. Wow it's like a modern day Sade with a hip hop twist. Ryan leslie the greatest producer ever, can make magic with anything. I'm speechless after hearing the whole album. It's something smooth which you can still play on your sound system.I can't wait to hear Cassie on some collaborations, and definitely see her next album."
2,Thank God for Ryan Leslie,"I usually like to support new artists by buying their CD's but with this purchase of Cassie's album I feel guilty that I've contributed to her album sales. As a male, I do think she is very attractive and that may be why I was so ready to get her album but she should have took the modeling, dancing, or acting route because Cassie has no vocal ability at all. I think that even Ciara has an edge on her a little bit. Just a little bit. I will admit that the production is hot. Thank God for Ryan Leslie who saved this album with the production. I find myself forgetting that Cassie is even singing because I am so into the beats and the production that I have to remind myself that this is Cassie's album and not a mixtape. We've all found out that she is a ""fluff"" artist and this will be her last album. Sorry Cassie fans but its the truth."
3,OK album - but great single,"Number 1 through to 6 are v.good, falls apart thereafter. I think the producer gave up after track 6 - leaving cassie to produce the rest herself lol."
1,"Uummm, WOW!","Diddy was tripping when he signed her. Her voice sounds so bad, that it's not even funny. Don't buy this album, it sucks!"
3,"Good album, even if she can't sing.","I bought this album because I had birthday money to spare and really liked Me & U. I really like this album. Her third track is really great and she makes me feel like she really means what she says. I can relate to her songs. Number 4 is nice and really sexy. It sets the mood. I really like number 8 though. Especially the bridge. She's not the best singer but her songs are still nice. Don't let hatas stop you from getting a really nice album.P.s. If you want real music though buy teena marie. Best female singer ever! Don't believe me, listen to Portugese Love on Amazon. That should change your mind!!Teena Marie Rocks!Oh yeah, this isn't monet this is her brother Jumaane"
3,Good Effort!,"This album is an ok album, definitely listenable. Although those question the talent of cassie, she's new and trying. The album is worth the listen. With a few vocal classes, she will improve when necessary."
2,Can't Say Much For It,"I'm afraid this is a pretty weak excuse for an album. Yes, there are catchy songs - obviously, the singles ""Me & U"" and ""Long Way 2 Go"" are great, but besides those, I can't say much for the album.Some of the songs are okay, like ""Miss Your Touch"" with its catchy, danceable beat and tune, and ""About Time"" which actually seems to make sense, as opposed to the other songs. Having her and others rap in the songs is really just cheesy to me. Some of the things they say are just plain stupid and annoying. I expect a lot better.The worst part, however, is Cassie's voice. It's extremely weak, and she has a very limited vocal range. I can't remember which song it was, but I was cringing as she worked her way up to a higher note. I'm sure without all of the background vocals/music and studio add-ins, she could not hit that note at all.So, I really wouldn't recommend this unless you're willing to spend your money on a CD that has really only 4/11 good songs."
2,I'd recommend something else,"As soon as I heard Me & U I knew Cassie would be huge. It's a great song and very catchy and a very summery tune. However, when I listened to the album, there were only two other songs I liked: Ditto is great and probably the best song on the album. It's even catchier than Me & U. I also like Long Way 2 Go, the second single from the album. In conclusion, the beats on this CD cover Cassie's somewhat weak vocals. I'd download the singles off iTunes, or buy something else instead."
2,Cassie Not going to well,"well, I cant say i dont like too many albums but this is not a strong start for cassie. I expected it to be bangin' and all i got was a woman who sounded like a litte girl, I was very dissapointed!!"
2,She has a pretty voice!,"Cassie's cd was ok, it wasn't what I expected it to be. She had a few good hits, but the rest of it sounded kiddy(like 3LW). I think she is a good artist, but the badboy isn't the label for her. I wish her the best of luck though because she is talented."
1,Omigosh,"Once again, long hair, hispanic chic, thin body, mediocre voice who can't hold a decent note and dances like a robot...MustI say why I gave this album 1 star? Didn't think so..."
1,Great way to help you go to sleep,"Seriously, if you have a hard time to go to sleep you can listen to this crap! 'CAUSE THIS WAS SOOO BORING!!! Track 10 was the only song where she sounds like she is giving her best. Even songs ""U and Me"" was super boring! I'm glad not many people liked this album! So cheap! So boring, most importantly!! DON'T GET THIS!!!! IT IS SOOOO BORING!! No one should try not to listen to this s**t! The interlude was really useless, she can quit right now."
1,Waste of Money,"Cassie's debut album had some of the best producers and songwriters around, but unfortunately, not even they could save the CD due to Cassie's weak vocals. The best tracks are ""Me & U"" and ""Long Way 2 Go."" I tried to like the album and thought it just needed to grow on me, but it didn't...it just turned out to be a waste of my time and money."
2,One hit Wonder,"I saw a performance of Cassie in BET and that took away my desire to buy the album. She sang over the track and look lost. It was terrible. She should stick with modeling. But she's pretty and that sells, right? And by the way, Mockingbird, she ain't Hispanic she's Phillipino."
1,Timeless Lyrics That Capture the Heart and Soul,"I reckon I correctly heard her melodious words: ""Some boys been talkin bout the way I do what I do"" but ""you're the one I want to give it to."" Why waste time critiquing her vocal skill; ""dat skill ain't what dis is about!""How I wanna talk bout ""how she do what she do"" too! That's the only part of the song I heard (and the beat), and she could have ""squawlked"" it just as well. Truly Inspirational!"
2,Marketing,"Failure to realize that Cassie is marketed for teenage girls, rather than an adult-contemporary R&B audience will leave most buyers unpleased. Not mention the entire album was written and produced by Ryan Leslie. So after listening to the album, you won't find out who Cassie is. Instead you end up listening to Ryan Leslie marketing himself through a teenage girl."
3,Long Way 2 Go,"Cassie's cd is average at best. Her vocals are not very impressive at all. They stay in the same range pretty much the whole album. After a while, she just becomes boring to listen to. The production is not all that great either. There are no stand out tracks, all of them are basically forgettable. The features on the album help bring some life to the cd but not enough to save it. Overall, Cassie has a long way to go, before she can compete in the industry as a threat to other r&b chics. I would reccommend listening to this album some how first before you buy it. Rare good tracks: Me and You, Call You Out, and Long Way To Go"
1,Isn't she that Delia's model?,I guess it's true what they say...Talent is no longer a Prerequisite...anyone can get a record deal.
1,Good Production...Bad Vocals,"The first time I heard ""Me and U"" I liked it...the beat was catchy and I figured other people would like it too. From the start I knew that Cassie didn't have the best voice, but the great production of the music took my focus off of her voice, and put it more on the music. Buying the album is a waste of money, and listening to it is a waste of time. The only songs I like are ""Me and U,"" ""Long Way 2 Go,"" and ""Ditto."" The other songs have good production, but Cassie's weak vocals ruin the effect of them. You'd be better off downloading the songs off the internet."
2,Would rather listen to a pack of howling dogs,Cassie is a real cutie no doubt but she can't sing period. I've heard crying infants that sound better than this young lady. The album has some decent music but the vocals that are laid over the music are atrocious! Cassie's voice makes me cringe similar to listening to someone scratch a chalkboard. I would never buy this album. I like the way cassie looks so instead of buying her album I will download a picture instead.
2,Not impressed.,"Honestly, I really wasn't impressed with this album. The first four songs really caught my attention but the remaining seven didn't impress me at all. I wasn't really thrilled about the first single at first, but it grew on me after a while. There are some great beats overall but the lyrics and vocal production could have been a whole lot better. Cassie is a beautiful girl but she needs to release something creative and unique or else she will get lost in the shuffle."
2,Very Lazy R&B/Pop Album,Nothing against Cassie but R&B is supposed to have a little passion if that is what she is trying to pull off with this album. All of the songs are sung with very little emotion and they aren't really that good. Cassie is another Bad Boy pop project who will fill the void for 12 year olds everywhere but true R&B fans would rather listen to Keyshia or Alicia.
1,Terrible,Pure studio work. She has a sing-songy voice. Cassie cannot carry a note. She cannot perform live. No talent here...save your money.

5,Bad condition of disk great movie for kids,Movie was entertaining for my grandaughter but the quality of the disk was terrible kept starting over and froze in many spots you need to replace the disk with a new one
1,not good,"It's not total crap, just a rip-off; it's ok with lots of cream and sugar, but at 18$/lb (w/ S&H), it is no better than Dunkin Donuts at the store. Will not buy again, needless to say."
3,Good Title - Expected More From the Update,"I have the previous version of the book and enjoyed it. I was hoping for more of an update when I bought this version. There is a lot of the material that is still the same. However, it you don't own a previous copy it's a good security book to check out. 3 to 4 stars."
5,Dinner table classics,"This cd is only soft to the touch when you hold it in your hands. When you try to sleep on them, it compresses at a strange angle and it has a tendency to slide away from my head. The gel is burried deep in the middle of the album and the surrounding stuffing compresses completely. The result is a very thin hard album against the head with no firmess or ability to hold shape. Using this album, I wake up with terrible neck pain every morning. To prevent the sliding, I have taken to turning mine sideways and using my shoulders to pin it down somewhat. This also allows more of my head to rest in the center of the album where the gel is, as most of the album is simply low quality stuffing. It is an awkward position and I am replacing this album."
2,Not really worth it,Yes this was an inexpensive purchase - but it still wasn't worthwhile. The machine and manual are not very user friendly. The quality of the copies is pretty bad and the cartridge ran out after only a few uses. Not even worth the $80 it cost me.
1,Avoid This Garbage,"I bought this today and it will go back to the store tomorrow.It ate a piece of paper That I still cannot find. Paper jam is all it knows. New machine shredded the film cartridge. Not worthy of keeping it as a paper weight. Sends quite well and recieves fine,just won't print and hates paper. Great price and features if you can get it to work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Save your $$"
1,Disappointed buyer,I've had this fax machine for only a few months and have received almost no faxes (except ones not solicited) and it tells me to get a new cartridge. I think it is not user friendly and it does not give enough copies for an expensive cartridge. I have just dragged out my old fax machine to use again. Think before buying this machine. I wish I had.
4,Good fax/copier,"I was drawn to this phone/fax/copier machine because of the price. Very low. I had one, same brand, for a few years, but it finally quit working and I needed a replacement. I don't need to fax regularly, just sometimes. Also rarely need to make copies, as I have a scanner, so I didn't have to have this feature, but it's nice to have for something faster than scanning it, then copying it. It's also nice to have the phone for those times the electricity goes out and the cordless phones go dead."
2,Printing/Paper feature is faulty,"I've had this fax machine for at least 10 years now. From day one it's had trouble printing out a confirmation sheet. Fortunately I only use it to do an occassional fax but I have to guess that whatever I sent made it to where it's supposed to go. It always complains there's a jam when there is no jam and the printing feature always tries to suck in too much paper gets mad at me. Thankfully, the main fax scanner works like it should otherwise I'd have put this in the garbage eons ago. Another minor annoyance is that the phone doesn't sit snuggly enough in the cradle. Just blow on it and it falls right off. I'm here today looking for another machine since I will need to fax alot more often now and I don't want to rely on faulty equipment."
2,STAY AWAY!,"This fax machine is not worth buying. It is flimsy, takes forever to send and receive faxes, and the ink ribbon lasts about 2 weeks (and thats with little use!).Do yourself a favor and buy another model or another Brother fax. The FAX 775 just isn't worth it."
3,Ok,Ok but it's hard to get fax and answering machine set up together. Other than that it is a good product.
1,horrible,This machine was horrible and should be taken off the market. I was on the phone with brother for hours trying to get it work and they could not even help me. Garbage
3,Good machine,Excellent price and works good. The only thing that bothers a bit is the copier: not very clear copies.The rest it's OK.
1,They don't make them the way they used to!,"I have been through 3 of these machines over the years. The first one lasted for years and years. I only raplaced it because it got too dirty to have on display in my office.The second one only lasted about a year before it started to not pull the carbon paper through to make the print.I have now bought my 3rd machine figuring that the 2nd one was just a lemmon. Now this machine only lasted a week before it started doing the same thing, and the local dealer says that it is not worth fixing.I know that I am not paying a lot of money for the machine, but it should last more than a week.I still have 6 of the 301 cartridge so I think I will try one more machine.Wish me luck!!!!!"
3,doesn't make many copies.... about 30 and I ran outta ribbon,I thought this would save me from running to the copy store.... but if I only can get about 30 copies off a ribbon.... not a good deal... oh well.....
1,junk...Junk...JUNK!!!,"I am on my second Brother Intellifax 775. The first one I threw out because of paper jamming problems and I'm ready to throw the current one away for the SAME reason as well. They work fine for approximately 6 months and then you get paper jams with EVERY incoming fax to the point of not being able to retrieve a fax and loosing all information that was sent to you. The roller stops feeding the paper through. I cleaned every single part I could get at and it has not helped. Also, my fax recipients tell me that my faxes have lines running through them to the point of sometimes not being able to read what I've sent. I don't do a lot of faxing so it's not due to extreme use. The price is cheap...the performance--cheaper. STAY AWAY from this model!"
4,Not bad at all,"Though it may not be her best soloalbum ever, it's still essential to any Stevie Nicks collection and features some very good songs.Honestly, I cannot understand why this albus has been critzised so much. I like it!"
2,Street Angel,"After leaving the band ""Fleetwood Mac"" in 1993 Stevie devoted time to a new record which would be her first album of all new material since 1989's ""The Other Side Of The Mirror"". While the album has three great songs, the rest of the material is pretty dull. Since that 1989 album nothing has changed much. Stevie is still not content with writing all of her songs anymore. She has relegated herself to writing with other people and in this case recording songs written by other people. Bob Dylan (?) contributes a decent offering ""Just Like A Woman, but the album is further evidence that Stevie may be losing her touch. Stevie shines best on the album's singles ""Blue Denim"" and ""Maybe Love Will Change Your Mind"" as well another non-single titled ""Kick It"". The album is not a complete waste, but it is a major step back for Stevie Nicks. Best song on the album : Maybe Love Will Change Your Mind"
2,Not a Disaster But....,"Stevie Nicks' only release of new material in the 1990's is a strangely dull, emotionless collection of songs that range from decent to despicible. Oddly, for a woman who has exhibited so passion in her songs, ""Street Angel"" sounds unfinished and tentative. Even when her material has not been first-rate, Stevie's soulful voice can make even the most questionable song sound heartfelt, but on this CD, Stevie sounds as if she does'nt care anymore. Part of the blame goes to Klonopin, a tranquilizer that Stevie admitted ""destroyed my creativity"" and the revolving door of Producers. Only on ""Rose Garden"" and ""Maybe Love Will Change Your Mind"" does Stevie show any glimmer of the great singer she was in the 1970's and (somewhat) in the 1980's. Thankfully, she remerged in 2001 with the excellent ""Trouble in Shangri-La"" CD."
3,Better Now than New,"Stevie has often expressed her disdain for ""Street Angel,"" describing it as ""broken and not fixable."" Clearly, she had a rough go of it for the first half of the 1990's, but she should cut ""Street Angel"" some slack. While clearly not her best album, much of the material is straightforward and the arrangements simple. The two singles, ""Maybe Love will Change Your Mind"" and ""Blue Denim"" are quite good, and the title cut is a clear glimpse into Stevie's lonely Soul. Stevie is rarely awful, but when she is awful she is REALLY awful. ""Docklands,"" Jane,"" and her dreadful remake of Bob Dylan's ""Just Like a Woman"" are right up there with ""Alice,"" ""When I See You Again,"" and ""Sister Honey"" as her most wretched songs. Skip them and a couple others and you have a pretty good six or seven songs. Give it a chance."
3,skipping cd,"most of this cd is great..... however.. it was tagged as LIKE NEW when purchased. When I played it... 3 of the songs skip. NOT happy about this!Otherwise, the cd is awesome!!!"
3,Nicks' weakest effort,"Although ""Destiny"" is gorgeous,and ""Bue Denim"" and ""Maybe love will change our mind"",are classic Nicks,the album is over-shadowed by bad production,and poor arrangement of songs,including the dreaded ""Dockalnds""..Stevie has said she hated working woth the producer,Thom,and didn't like the final result..I agree with her.."
2,An OK effort - but below Stevie's standards,"Despite the fact that this album has not sold very well (it just went Gold in 1997) and the nasty comments by Critics, ""Street Angel"" is not bad, just boring. ""Blue Denim"" is the best song, the title track is not bad, and the duo of ""Rose Garden"" and ""Maybe Love will Change your Mind"" work well too. But the surrounding material is lifeless."
3,mixed feelings,"interesting to read other reviews of this album,i found this album made up of tracks i either loved or didn't!& i feel similar about trouble in shangri-lai love stevie's music, as a whole, & this album is as important a part of her portfolio as any other, some of the tracks are outstanding, such as ""jane"" (lump in the throat time!); blue denim, ""rose garden"" i love for it's country/patsy cline connection & it's wistfulness, ""Street Angel"" musically is typical stevie ""rock queen"" tragic/dramatic & ""kick it"" & ""love is like a river"" are other favourites."
1,Bad cd by a good singer,"This album is a real disappointment! ""Docklands"" is about doing laundry, ""Street Angel"" romanticizes the plight of the homeless, and ""Jane"" is a painful ode to Jane Goodall, a woman renowned for her work with chimpanzees, but deserving of a better tribute than this song. Die-hard fans alone should buy this album, but for the casual listener or fan, check out any Stevie Nicks album but this one!"
2,Below average,"Stevie Nicks of the nineties isn`t much to write home about. Her 70`s and eightees releases are in general top rate and totally in their own league! Honest Stevie Nicks diehards should not kid themselves. We love the woman, but this album and her other 90`s involvments are a pale forgery of the brand we love!"
2,i tried soooo hard......,"Miss Stevie Nicks is my absolute favorite singer/songwriter of all time. I got this cd about a year ago and based on extremely mixed reviews i decided to give this a chance and not be influenced by the other reviews good or bad. That being said this cd is awful. i will always love Blue Denim but this cd has a generic jazzy/soft contemporary rock feel of the mid 90's. Its a shame because production killed this cd but ill admit some of the lyrics are pretty good. Destiny in particular since it has the same first verse as the timeless song ""Enchanted"" I adore anything that Stevie is involved in but this doesnt really even seem like it is her music, no wonder she didnt promote it and pretends now like it never happened, if she would have been able to be around for the producing of this album it could have been great, no fault to Stevie tho it fell into the wrong, greedy hands of someone trying to make money off her when she was getting her life on track! LOVE U STEVIE"
2,A revolving door of producers,"Street Angel finds Stevie Nicks at her most lost, most confused period of her solo career. By far her weakest album, this one is for the true die-hards. It was especially hard for longtime fans considering her previous effort also was not up to par. Despite the fantastic title track with David Crosby on harmony vocals along with a few others produced my Heartbreaker Mike Campbell, this album is medicore. Surprising, considering Nicks is capable of greatness when she wants it. The packaging is sloppy and low-budget, and the songs are generally weak. Very disappointing although when this was released in 1994, her singing hadn't sounded this good in ages. It is no wonder that the Fleetwood Mac reunion was Nicks's next project."
3,There are some high points.....,on this particular album....but it certainly is not a favorite of mine. I was hoping that the much hyped release of TISL was going to be my own Nicks Fix and make up for what Street Angel Lacked. Unfortunately....it did not. Out of the two CDs....go for Street Angel.
2,worst of artist,"i know a lot of critics liked this cd,but honestly i thought it was a lazy effort.tired old songs,stevie had been writing over the years.when i bought this i was hoping for great songs such as blue denim,but the album just falls apart as you listen!"
3,Fallen Angel,"This is an adequate collection of 14 songs recorded during the early 1990's a time in her life and career that she was suffering from Epstein's Barr Syndrome and her decades of substance abuse. It is overproduced and the overall sound of the album is what I refer to as tin-ny (kind of frought with static).The album could easily be the follow-up to Stevie Nick's finest debut 1981 solo album ""Bella Donna."" The best tracks are ""Blue Denim,"" ""Destiny,"" which reprises her 1983 classic ""Enchanted"" from the 1983 album ""The Wild Heart,"" ""Rose Garden,"" ""Maybe Love Will Change Your Mind""(the radio friendly hit that missed the Top 40) and ""Jane.""Stevie fans will enjoy this album. Novices would be better off listening to Stevie's new 3 CD box set that has many of the hit tracks from this album in stripped down versions."
3,An angel with clipped wings,"It has now been well reported that Stevie Nicks had something of a breakdown in the early nineties suffering from an exhaustion syndrome. This album shows how much she was affected - a clear decline since ""The Other Side of the Mirror"" as it has none of the punch nor the great ballads of that album.That said, it still has some pleasing aspects to it. If you can get past the awful cover of ""Just Like A Woman"" and the rock-by-numbers ""Blue Denim"" there are still hints of the Stevie Nicks that we all know and love. ""Listen to the Rain"" is a jangly little song that creeps up on you and its nagging rhythm stays in your mind, while ""Greta"" is an enjoyable diversion, along the lines of ""Juliet"". The best cut though is ""Jane"", which despite its subject matter - the forgotton chimpanzee - is an example of the lovely spare ballads that have become her trademark since ""Landslide"".All in all, this is really for Nicks fans only, but a curious addition to the Nicks collection."
2,Definitly her weakest album,"Some of these songs are as tired as Stevie said she was at the time. The majority of the album is very weak with a few exceptions of ""Blue Denim"", ""Destiny"" and ""Kick It"" (my favorite track off the album). I'm glad Stevie has re-improved herself since. ""Sweet Girl"" and ""If You Ever Did Believe"" are indications that her next album will be MUCH better!"
4,"A good one, but not her best","listening to it all over again, it`s getting better like old wine. best song: street angel."
2,When we rush we make mistakes.,"Stevie Nicks,talented musican and song writer puts out a horrible album in 1994. I have done some research on this album that because of its poor sales and listenability. it was fault of Stevie Nicks'producer Thom Pazano and the entire atlantic records company label for a new hit and money maker by rushing nicks into a completed project. however it was more than they bargined for. saling to 27 on the billboard chart in 1994 it spent a total of only 3 weeks on the top 100 albums debuting at 44 jumping up to 27 then down to 88 and then it was no more.however tthere are a few tracks that redeem this album. sorta?Such as:Blue Denim,Rose Garden,and Kick it. this album is bad,dont get me wrong but if you want some good material by Stevie Nicks by her new hit album Trouble in Shangri-la at stores today or by from here Amazon.com"
1,Sorry!,"I love Stevie Nicks but this CD just doesn't do it.If you insist on having it, it can be found in just about any 99 cents bin. If you insist."
5,Sweet!!!,"Joques Cousteau- Explorer, inventor, gentleman. This is a great series made long before HD. I actually remember seeing these on black and white set."

2,"Emile Henry Flame Top 6.3-Quart Oval Oven, Black","I loved this at first and used it sporatically for several months until it cracked and was rendered useless. Cast iron the only way too go and much, MUCH cheaper and more durable. I now use this to store dry ingredients in my cupboard"
3,DTroppens,"If you enjoy nuts and bolts data, you'll enjoy this book. A lot of what you'd expect out of a team press guide is in here. And there are silly lists like what Hall of Fames various Tigers are in and things like that. There is some reading, but most of the book is lists.It's a decent book. If are a Tiger fan and can get it at a reasonable price, go for it. If you are not a Tiger fan and don't know the difference between Champ Summers and Tom Veryzer, you probably won't find it that entertaining."
4,"DQ, actually a pretty good book.","I had to read this book for a writing class this semester (Narrative and Technology), and I found it to be surprisingly good. It was a little hard to read due to the translation from Spanish to English (lots of footnotes to clarify), but otherwise was a fun book to read. Mind you, I wouldn't go out and choose to read this book on my own, but I am glad that I read it. Overall, I noticed that during the discussion of the readings from this book in class really helped to shed some light on the underlying themes and intentions of this book. Cervantes was a pretty witty guy, and you have to realize that while you're reading that this was written in the 1500's in Spain during the Inquisition. I would say, if you're reading this one on your own, to pick up a copy of Sparknotes to help you along the way. Enjoy."
3,Not A Natural Sense of Rhythm,"A very good translation but it seems to me that it lacks the grace of the recent Penguin translator's work. Though this woman is considered well as a translator, this piece of work makes me fear for what the next translation may bring. There may be less in this translation that falls gracefully on my ear, and since I hear what I read, as a matter of course, this can be a special problem."
2,Classic?,"I don't get it. The book seems to meander and go off on crazy tangents to no purpose. And yet, there must be a lot I am missing. I have read that many famous people have kept a copy of this book with them all their lives. For example, I read that Prez John Adams always had a copy with him. And the Spanish PM always has a copy. I have tried reading it in spanish and it is no better than the English so it couldn't be a translation problem.I would like to see a synopsis of perhaps the subliminal messages I am missing. Something must be there but what?"
5,What a gift!,"A wonderful novel, a great translation, and a superb reading by George Guidall, who beautifully captures the story's humor and pathos. If you've never read Don Quixote but are curious about why it is so highly respected , or if you've read it before and want to experience it in a new way, treat yourself to this newly translated and unabridged recording. It's 40 hours long, and if you're like me, you will hate to see it end. Don Quixote and Sancho Panza are truly unforgettable characters. Cervantes has given us the ultimate ""buddy movie"" plot, with adventures, disillusionment, growth, irony, and plenty of witty and compassionate commentary about the plight of humanity. Truly one of the world's great novels, and you'll probably never find a more pleasant way to experience it."
3,Not for the unitiated,"I picked this up expecting to love one of the great works of literature. The story of a madman chasing windmills sounds so fetching. I am sure the praise is well deserved, but it is not accessible for the uninitiated. Perhaps this is another case of the reader being unworthy - I felt that way with Naipul - but the story couldn't hold me. 100 pages in I couldn't finish it.For those who love Spanish Literature, I am sure this is a gem. For those looking to expose themselves to a classic, there are other works more suited for the cause. Definitely not for the uninitiated."
3,"Great product, Slow shipping","The Item was in great condition, no problems at all. The shipping was super slow. I live in Hawaii so that might have something to do with it."
4,Excellent Depth,An Excellent Translation That Adds A Great Deal To The Story That I Thought I Might Already Know But Now Know More About.
3,Prof. Harold Bloom is Wrong,"Prof. Harold Bloom of Yale, America's reigning literature guru, says that ""Cervantes and Shakespeare...are the central Western authors, at least since Dante, and no writer since has matched them..."" Bloom's elevation of Cervantes to near literary sainthood to the contrary notwithstanding, I found ""Don Quixote"" boring, tedious, and nothing more than the supreme test of a reader's ability to persevere in an exercise of sheer willpower to complete a task that never should have been undertaken, a task which was assumed only because an eminence like Bloom touted it. Even a power as great as Bloom's had its limits: I read only part 1 of ""Don Quixote"" (452 pages), and abandoned any thought of trudging though the 488 pages of part 2. I'm willing to accept an ""F"" in Prof. Bloom's literature class; anything to not have to read any more Cervantes."
5,One of the Best-Loved Novels of all Time!,"This is a best-loved novel with good reason. Who hasn't heard of Don Quixote and his ""tilting at windmills""? The novel was intended to be a satire on chivalry as experienced during Cervantes' time. The book was written in the late sixteenth century. But the book is much more than this. Cervantes leaves nothing sacred as he pokes fun at all the social and literary conventions of his day. The book also gives a very good picture of Spanish life and times as it was in the sixteenth century. There are lots of wonderful minor characters that Don Quixote meets along his way. Don Quixote and his faithful Sancho Panza introduce the reader to all kinds of human triumphs and foibles as they pursue their lofty adventures. This story is well worth reading if for no other reason than the story of Don Quixote has achieved a legendary spot in our culture."
4,"Don Quixote; Grossman, Kindle Edition","After perusing a few different translations, this is my favorite. The English used is right on the mark with what I dream would come from discourse with a valiant Knight. Extremely eloquent, I love reading passages where Don Quixote spouts the rhetoric of love and the honorable ways of a knight-errant. I think this translator enjoyed it as well, as her passages of it makes you smile and really like the characters. Just touching on a couple other translations, I've seen, they seem faded, or diluted by colloquialisms, or like the education level of language used isn't quite as rich; which is great if you want to speed read and enjoy the adventure. The missing star, 4 stars, is due to drm, missing cover, and other formatting mistakes of the kindle version."
5,"Great service, great audiobook, great translation","Edith Grossman's translation is superb, breathing new perhaps the greatest book every written. I love the reader, George Guidall, which is a must for any audiobook to be successful. Lastly, the service by Amazon was great. 5 Stars for everyone."
3,REALLY FUNNY ... and then Cervantes tries to make a point.,"I haven't laughed at book this much since Superfudge. I actually laughed out loud. This is pretty much slapstick comedy that is popular today... except that it was written around 1600. I only gave this book 3 stars because there are 52 chapters in this book but only the first 31 are really good. The last 21 chapters Cervantes starts to drone on trying to make some point about chivalry. Maybe he was getting paid by the pound at this point. New characters are added every chapter and each one tells their history (a few pages each) and then there is usually a debate about something where each debater professes for a paragraph/page (they become one and the same at this point). And then back and forth. I actually started to skip through towards the end and I don't really think I missed much. In conclusion, I think that this book is worth it for the first 31 chapters."
3,Be careful on the audio book,"The story is obviously a classic. There is no doubt about that.My three star rating is referring to the audio download version.The narration is very difficult to follow at best. The narrator has a very strong accent (which is not neccessarily bad) but also fairly poor diction. That is a very challenging combination.On top of that, the link that Amazon provides to the audio download does not seem to match the translation on this page. This was very frustrating since sometimes I enjoy following along for portions. Unfortunately, the audio versions don't clearly indicate the translation being used.You might enjoy it, but just be careful.Hope this helps."
1,"""Don Quixote""--the pure definition of the word ""boring""...","Yep. I read it. Boring? Yes. Boring beyond belief.It is also mundane, vapid and worthless.Read Hemingway or Faulkner. Read Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.Even the ""comic section"" of your local rag is better than this work of literaly trash."
3,FYI: The March 2011 edition ISBN 9781613820179 with the yellow cover is translated by John Ormsby,"Amazon often groups all reviews of various translations which makes it confusing to buy the correct book.The Simon & Brown published March 2011 edition ISBN 9781613820179 (with the yellow cover) is the public domain translation by John Ormsby. Amazon's descriptive text for this book (ISBN 9781613820179) was reused from the Grossman edition which makes it seem like it's the Edith Grossman translation. It is not. The J Ormsby edition also does not have helpful footnotes or endnotes.If you're looking for the Edith Grossman translation (ISBN 0060934344), the exact link is:Don Quixote"
