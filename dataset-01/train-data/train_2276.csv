1,"Once again, cheap knock-off versions.","Don't waste your money on this, these are just cheap cover versions, not the original songs."
2,A dissapointing re-mix,A word of warning for these looking for a classic Mary Wells experience: you won't find it on this disk.This is a rather dissapointing collection of classic songs re-mixed in the 80s with a very aged and poly made sound. My reccomendation is to look elsewhere than this album.
5,Solid Ending To a Strong Series,"As I watched through the final episodes, The exitement was almost too much to bear. So much happens in just the first two episodes of this volume (21 and 22). Although the exitement peiters off after this, you aren't left with that ""So what just happened?"" feeling that most anime's give. You get a sense of relief that the characters have kept on living even after their lives were turned upside-down and seemingly torn apart. There's not much more to be said about it except, well, watch it."
3,Misleading...,"The product itself is good. The product written description is accurate, but watch out. The picture shows a tire mounted onto a yellow wheel, which may suggest (it suggested to me) that you are buying the tire-wheel set, mounted. You are not. You are buying the tire only. Obviously a more honest illustration would be of the tire alone, NOT mounted on a wheel."
4,great feel,have not put them on my buggy yet but they feel great and should last along time when driving on road great price to boot
5,One of my favorites..,"This Faramir figure from the ROTK line is one of my favorites from the line. Also, if you came in late, this is probably the only Faramir figure you'll be able to get without spending a lot of money. (The Two Towers Faramir figure is extremely rare, and goes for up to $50 on ebay.)Faramir's face sculpt is pretty good. Its not a dead-on likeness, but at least he isn't yelling or anything. (Like the Pellenor Fields Aragorn, or TTT Eomer.)His body is great. He is clothed in his Gondorian armor, and it is nicely detailed, with the White Tree of Gondor on his chest.He comes with only his sword. However, I could not get the sword from his hand. It is intended to be removable, but it is stuck in too tight. (Or at least mine was.)Hope my review helped. It is a great figure and definitely worth adding to your collection."
2,Not made for a large motorcycles,This jack is narrow and the lifting surfaces are small. I had a hard time lining up the jack for my harley and didn't trust to leave the area while it was up. I don't recommended this jack for large cruisers. Pay more and get a larger jack.
1,Stay away from this one,Got the Torin Big Red Jack today. This jack is scary and poorly constructed. The welding is like someone was in their first day of welding school. The platform was warp and not level. The safety arm was bent. The motorcycle is leaning when on the stand. Taking it back to Home Depot as soon as possible. I recomend that you don't buy this one........
3,Poor manufacturing/assembly quality control,"This item had to be partially disassembled to be assembled due to a manufacturing error resulting in insufficient clearances. The pivot bolts supplied are too short for the intended assembly and the instruction manual is both incomplete and difficult to read.On the plus side, it arrived promptly without damage. While the item will do the intended job, I'm hard-pressed to give this a positive recommendation."
3,Satisfied with the Jack,"Hello,I used the jack for the first time and was impressed. I was not impressed with the assembly. I was missing parts and had to dig through my stockpile of spare parts to find a nut to replace the one I lost. I have a Triumph T100 and when teh jack is fully extended the bike is a little wobbly. Bike weighs 500lbs. Overall I would give this Jack a satisfactory rating."
1,This book is getting returned,"Although the illustrations are very sweet, this book has a negative theme. The doggie steals Sam's cookie and Sam gets angry, calls the doggie ""dumb"" and is pictured pulling the doggies ear and stepping on his tail. I don't like the way the conflict is resolved in this story. It sets a bad example."
1,Bad example for a child,"The subject matter is good and real...a dog taking a childs cookie. The way the child is shown handling the situation is appalling...saying ""dumb dog"" and pulling his ear. What was the author thinking?! I will not be reading this book to my grandson."
1,Horrible Book That Makes Children Scared,"This book is TERRIBLE. I bought it because it was recommended at a library website and wanted to add to my neice and nephew's library. That ""doggie"" steals Sam's cookie. Sam the pulls the dogs ear and says, ""Dumb doggie!"" Then the dog growls back?!?! My neice and nephew (under four yrs. old) shook their heads and said no more reading, ""i don't like this."" I felt so bad I wasted the measly dollars on this for a book that reinforces inappropriate responses (hitting animals, saying ""dumb"" by a toddler in the story for parents and teachers to read to other toddlers."
3,cheap plastic sprinkler,"A friend of mine brought me some sprinklers just like this and he got them at the 99 cent store. They are exactly the same. I guess they are the same as any other plastic. I guess I was just hoping for something a little higher quality. Their are not bad, just over priced."
1,They ruined a great product,"I've been drinking celestial seasonings blueberry green for years, but never again. They ruined it by changing the recipe. Rather than the great berry taste, it now tastes like every other green tea at a bad chinese restaurant.More than that, Amazon is not accurately representing this item. I bought a number of boxes thinking that I was getting the old version (they list the old ingredients - I was trying to stock up - but sent the new, terrible version), now I'm stuck. I'm in the market for a new brand. This one is ruined.Trader Joe's Pomegranate White is very good. That's what I'm doing from now on..."
2,Not even close to what it once was....,"Like others here, I found the original formulation available up until a year or so ago to be the BEST green tea ever. It was exactly because it DIDN'T taste or look like green tea that it was superior, it tasted like tangy blueberries with green tea. Now it tastes and looks like green tea with a tepid blueberry flavoring. I contacted Hain/Celestial Seasonings three times to register my displeasure...guess what....they don't care!They did their focus groups, and had their meetings, and decided that changing the formula and the artwork for that matter was strategically superior to what they were doing before. We just have to accept that sometimes the powers that be get it wrong, and try to come up with a workaround.I have found that the Hibiscus/Blueberry Superflower Tea from the Republic of Tea is a decent substitute, as long as you brew it with a bag of your favorite green tea.(Was brewing two bags at a time anyway because I drink 16 oz. of tea at a time.)"
3,Disappointed,"I was addicted to Celestial Seasonings blueberry green tea & they stopped selling it at my local grocery store, so I started ordering it online. Now it appears the tea has been changed. It smells a bit like blueberry but the wonderful taste is gone. I am sad."
4,price,I was wondering if someone could tell me why the box set is more expensive than if you buy each volume separate?
1,Terrible,"I would say that the explanations in this book are really bad, but then hardly any explanation is even attempted. The book is really a collection of a bunch of problems and projects-- with no solutions to any of the problems. The graphics and illustrations are very well done, however.With little explanation, few examples, and no solutions to the exercises to check progress with-- good luck learning anything. This is an aweful book for students, even those who are math majors.It would be a useful book for instructors of topology to find problems in."
1,Math Undergrad,"As nice as the graphs and figures in the book are, the explanations are chopped; they do not make you think through the concepts from beginning to end. When I read the explanations I feel like I am given the punch-line immediately with no build-up and hence I am usually lost and trying to figure out what is ""between the lines"". It feels too concise and not well-elaborated; like the concepts were taken from a professor's notes and thrown into the book with an assumption that the reader will quickly put things together."
4,Sexy? Yes! Practical? Not so much.,"This is a very, very sexy outfit. The fabric is soft and feels terrific. My wife looks fantastic in it, and she loves the way she looks in it. The only down side: she tells me that the criss cross fabric looping around the neck starts to choke after a bit. But it looks so good (and holds up so well) that she still puts it on now and then to give me a quick thrill."
3,not for the big chests,"Way too tight around the neck if you have a large chest. Wife is a 44D - this did not fit, had to be returned. Fabric seemed of a good quality, and the ""wavy pattern"" looked nice -"
2,Some recipes questionable...,"Some of the recipes presented here are quite tasty...but I found that many of them were thoroughly unworkable, as if they'd been translated into ""vegetarian"" without much thought. Matzoh balls are fussy enough with eggs -- with nothing to hold them together but potatoes, they're nearly impossible! Other recipes lacked flavor. In short, simply removing meat, dairy, and eggs does not necessarily make a good vegetarian recipe; something else needs to be provided to supply flavor and structure."
3,Feel free to add more spices!,"I normally love the cookbook offerings from the Vegetarian Resource Group and anxiously awaited the arrival of this one. However, many of the recipes are somewhat bland--I've remedied that by adding more flavorings as appropriate to the recipe. They are easy to make with clear instructions, but the flavor is somewhat lacking. (One example was the low-fat 'mock chopped liver,' which I made for my family and was roundly booed. Try the VRG regular high-fat version which uses walnuts--much better unless you are looking to cut fat!) But if you are looking for lowfat recipies, these are OK."
3,Easy to follow,This cookbook will be easy to follow and give more alternatives to eating a sound diet.
1,Personalized Preschool,"WARNING!!!!!! If you have a 64 bit version of Windows, these CDs will NOT work!!! And there is nothing on the CD that states whether you can run on 32 or 64 bit. The software company does not seem to be able to send me a version or allow me to download a version that is compatible with 64 bit.Thankfully, it's not an expensive software. But still - a little warning would have been nice!"
4,Great Program,My 4 year old loves to play this game. I really like the ADAPT technology that allows you to determine where your child should start and track their progress. Great game!
1,Does Not Work on Newer Versions of Windows!!!,"If you purchased your computer in the past three years, this will most likely not work on your computer. Although the description said it was Windows compatible, it will not install. I am so disappointed because I purchased four Reader Rabbit programs. It was a total waste of money."
2,Won't Install on Win 7,"When I finally upgraded to Windows 7, (Windows 95 or Higher stated on the requirements) my older versions of Reader Rabbit simply stopped working and would shut down. As I have a 3 yr old in the house, I decided to upgrade to a newer version on Reader Rabbit as well. Wrong! Not one of the 4 programs I purchased will even install. ""Not compatible with this version of Windows. Contact the publisher"" Contacting the publisher results in a message that email and phone support are no longer supported. Thanks Riverdeep for nothing. Only 2nd grade had a patch and that was for the calendar.I even tried to install it in compatability mode to Win XP with the same result. Will not install.We loved the Reader Rabbit programs for our older children, and it's a shame that Riverdeep took it over from Learning Company and then allowed it to die. Maybe I could buy an older Win 98 machine, or slice up my hard drive, install 98, and install it on that for the childrens' use only."
1,Would have been really nice to know that it won't run on most PCS,This is one of those times that I should have read the reviews before I bought. I have a 64 bit machine and this software company doesn't support that! Geez. Just glad this wasn't expensive! Very unhappy!
1,Reader Rabbit Junk,As stated if you have a 64 bit computer version will not work. Comapny would not reply to emails or phone calls. So then it is a waste of money. If I could I would give it zero stars.
4,Solid Background to SPM,"Scanning Probe Microscopy: The Lab on a Tip by Ernst Meyer covers the two main techniques of SPM: STM and AFM (here called SFM). There is also a detailed section on Magnetic Force Microscopy(MFM). There are shorther sections on the less well known techniques, i.e. friction force microsocpy, SNOM, etc. The books covers the theory well, and is reasonably up to date as I write in 2007. The figures are clear, and the few microgrpahs presented in clear greyscale. There are relatively few applications, but these are easy to find elsewhere. Overall, a great book for the theory of SPM."
3,Does the job.,"Good collar. My dog scratches his collar much less with the rolled collar. I had a hard time finding a size large enough in the store, so I was happy to find one here. Some of the color has worn within the first week but otherwise a good product."
1,Worst comic book I've ever read,"Simply put, this is the worst travesty of a comic I have ever had the misfortune of reading. I have loved Marvel comics for years and have a passing interest in Manga, so I was warily curious about how this would turn out. It's awful. The character designs are terrible, the plot is weak and unispired, and the dialogue sounds like it was written by an eight year old. Save yourself the wasted time and brain cells and avoid this series."
1,what a disaster,"how horrible, as if japanese culture hasn't hijacked our comics enough now they want to make them as cheesy as the massive flux of manga that is invading america. keep this crap away from real comics."
2,Total Bore,"I was really excited about reading this book, as a person with mental illness, I've acquired a deep interest of the history of psychiatry and medicine in general. I like to see the history and progress of medicine. I thought I was really going to enjoy this book, but I didn't.I wish it would have been written more in easier language and not as technical as it was, or even liked it if the technical things were explained better. It makes for such a great story, should have been written better for general public to read. There were bits and pieces I found interesting, but the only part that really kept my attention was the ending Epilogue."
1,Sadly disappointing,"As a psychiatric resident, I thought I might find something of educational value in this book. Instead I found a full-scale assault on psychiatry and psychiatrists. Although the book appears well researched, I found the author to have surprisingly little understanding or appreciation of modern psychiatric treatment. This, combined with his crusade against psychiatry, leads to spurious conclusions, broad generalizations and inferences that are misleading and untrue. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,I don't really like it,"I hoped for the best on this one and am pretty disappointed. Firstly, unlike CTR you CANNOT race 2-players at the same time WITH CPU opponents--so all you can do is a head-to-head race, not that fun and quickly tiring unless you are 10 years old. Second, the game saves progress unnecessarily often, and gives you a ""loading"" screen way too often, it's just annoying and takes about five minutes to set up a simple race. Third, when you enter the 1-player tournaments, if you do not place 1st, 2nd or 3rd at ANY point during the tournament, it is game over and start from the beginning. That sucks, at least let me finish the darn thing and try for a comeback! Fourth and least importantly, the sound effects stink, IMHO. The graphics are less than impressive too. Okay that's all"
1,Yuck!,"Bad graphics, jerky animation and control, opponents that are always making you eat their dust, poor turning capacity, annoying music and sound effects, and an awkward Create-a-Racer mode--need I say more? If I do, then please allow me to say, ""Avoid this turkey at all costs!"""
3,Eh.,"I bought this book for a grad class on Young Adult Literature. While Aronson has some interesting and well-argued ideas, his blatant misogynistic tendencies make me shy away from accepting his work completely (He blames women's lib. for the downfall of the US education system and lack of ""appropriate"" books for boys). The editing is also less than professional (funny, since he works at a publishing company) - many chapters will start out as a speech, and halfway through refer to previous chapters in the book. Again, he does have some watertight arguments for nonfiction and history books, but overall this is not a book I will be keeping on my shelf."
4,It works,The only problem is that it doesn't come with the adapter that snaps to the rhino. It plugs into the one that came with the wall charger.
3,incomplete,"The plug in adapter works fine, but you have to use the snap on adapter that came with your rino. That means you can't have one in your rig at all times, and one in the house. I'm not sure if you can order just the snap on adapter either."
3,DONT COME WITH BACK CHARGING PIECE FOR RINO 530 HCX,THE ONLY BAD THING ABOUT THIS IS IT DOES NOT COME WITH A EXTRA BACK PIECE YOU USE TO CHARGE YOUR RINO 530 HCX. SO I CALLED GARMIN AND ORDERED A XTRA ONE FOR MY UTV.
1,Buy something else!!!,I bought on of these less than six months ago. The product was great while it worked. Easy install that anyone can do. The problem is that the display screen just stopped working. I expected get more than 6 months use out of this product. It's really too bad because I loved the idea of not doing a hard install and spending a ton of money. I would not recommend buying an Audiovox product ever again.
1,BassPlayer,"I have owned this radio for about year and half. The radio worked well until last month. The contacts at the bottom of the radio are not working...I keep getting a no antenna message. I tryed to use contact cleaner and now the on/off button does not work. I use the radio in my car, truck and at home, I have the same problem on all the docks. I real like Xm radio, so if I change to a different radio I will have to also buy all new docking stations."
1,Avoid this one,Got the Audiovox Xpress for my birthday in February. Unit died in July. Still in warranty but Audiovox refuses to repair it without proof of purchase unless I pay $90. Most manufacturers stand behind their products no matter what and those are the companies that deserve our consideration. I now have two Roady II's and have had no issues with them.
4,Galco Yaqui,This holster is high quality in materials and workmanship. It makes for a good range holster but is a little hard to conceal. Maybe in the late fall or winter when a larger jacket or coat is worn. Hard to conceal under a shirt in summertime. I would recommend.
5,Inspirational,"As an educator I have worked with several autistic students over the years and this book is a perfect model for what can be accomplished by these talented children with a little guidance. The book is an inspiration for all those working the field of education as it helps us imagine the possibilties for success that all exceptional learners possess. I read this book to my class and we came up with the idea of ""response journaling"" through art and text as a classroom project to issues we face daily and throughout the year. This book has given my class the motivation to create similar products. The book is well done and would be a welcome addition to any classroom library, especially if the class includes an autistic student. This book will help the other students in class more clearly understand autism and some issues that surround it. Great read-aloud."
4,"RAUNCHY, FUNNY, IN-YOUR-FACE","I saw Bitch & Animal open for Ani DiFranco last week, and I loved their act so much I picked up ""Eternally Hard"" right after the show. The whole band is made up of just 2 crazy women & a bunch of instruments (mostly Bitch on the bass guitar or electric violin & Animal on the bongos). The best part about Bitch & Animal is their personalities-- they're raunchy, funny, in-your-face and raw. I have to admit that they are best live--I laughed and cheered so hard my stomach hurt all the way through their songs. Try to see them live if you can. Anyway, my favorite tracks on this CD are Best c**k on the block, scrap metal, ganja (to the tune of ""gloria""), sparkly queen aereola & boy girl wonder. If you like Ani DiFranco or Righteous Babe Records (they're on that label), then you should definitely try ""Eternally Hard""--Highly Recommended!!"
2,Stoic Warriors is not Stoic,"This book is interesting, and far more readable than most books on philosophy. But, for those who have actually studied Stoic philosophy, there is a problem. That problem is that the book does not do a very good job of presenting the teaching of Stoicism, and it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the author does not much like Stoicism.A major problem is that the author, Nancy Sherman, is an Aristotelian, and clearly has little sympathy for, or understanding of, Stoic philosophy. For instance, she many times criticizes Stoic teaching on emotions, such as anger, as impossible to apply to the problems of military personal. But she neglects to mention that the Stoics never claimed that Stoic philosophy was a simple pill that could quickly solve problems without the time necessary for real change, and a re-evaluation of values.It seems, in fact, that Ms Sherman may not have taken enough time to understand Stoic philosophy in depth."
3,"Good topic, solid anecdotes, great concept, moderately executed","Great concept, as I was lured to this book while buying some Seneca and a past history of military study, but comes up a bit short on readability. Though I want to like the anecdotal pieces about Stockdale and others, for instance, the academic sections don't mesh well with the military stories and analogies."
3,It never really comes together,"With this book Dr. Sherman has taken on a vitally important and difficult task - an exploration of the philosophical and psychological underpinnings of military mind and culture. In my opinion what is best about this book is the thorough and expert scholarship. What is lacking, perhaps, could be integration. The views of the Stoics are carefully and faithfully represented. Some insightful accounts of military culture and the psychology and behavior of soldiers are provided. Sometimes, it is pointed out, the two match up pretty well. Other times, it is argued, they probably shouldn't match up (even if they do in fact). What I took away from this book was a better understanding of Stoicism as a philosophy, some interesting insights into military life, and a sort of hazy idea of what they have to do with each other. I found this book interesting and informative, but not very compelling."
5,A real romantic keeper,"I hate to cover, but with some books not having a picture on it at all I quess I'll shut up.Gideon Langford helps Ellena when their siblings disappear after a avalance, while sking.Ellena knows she sister Justine and his brother Kit have a baby girl Violette.Gideon finds out his brother Russell and Russell's wife Pamela have the baby.Gideon gets the baby for a price, and he takes the baby home with him after he gets Ellena to agree to marry him so they will have a better chance of getting Violette.Ellena hasn't given up on finding her sister, but after meeting cold mean Pamela Ellena must have Violette.So they marry and love blooms.Gideon is already in love with Ellena, and she learns to love Gideon."
5,Great for small insecticide jobs.,I use this sprayer to spray for ants and fleas around houses. I have ran many gallons through it and it hasn't let me down yet. I clean it after each use and hope it will last for years. The brass tip and wand is a nice touch.
1,What a dud!,Out of the box this unit has a spray handle that will pinch your hand so wear a glove. The unit is very heavy and it is difficult to see the level of the contents you are trying to pour into it. The pump failed to maintain pressure. It looked real well made from the picture on Amazon but what a dud!
2,Ladies watch,The shipping carton was not securely wrapped and the crystal of the watch had several tiny scratches on it.
2,Very basic,"For a person with some business process experience, no great process improvement findings/insight can be found in this book. A bit dissapointed on this book. The information was pretty basic."
5,Review,"good really accurate and really helps me out in the class I chose to take, helps me learn at a faster pace"
4,"So far a riveting read,(40 pages till the end)","The first book in this series grabbed me, and ihave ripped through the second at the speed of a bunnydog dance. There are 2 more I know i can get my eyes on. And then.... Please help , I'm Ripe To Read (THE WAR AGAINST THE CHTORR ,BOOK 5,6 & 7) ""There is no such thing as overkill."" -SOLOMON SHORT"
3,Hurry up,Some of us will die before this dude gets around to writing another book. The story is pretty good but who wants to wait 5 years for the next installment?
5,Gerrold Betrays Readers,"The first 4 books of this series are one of the greatest achievements in Sci-Fi literature. That also makes it one of the greatest betrayals ever perpetrated by an author upon his readers. I don't know what the deal is, greed, illness, a lobotomy, but books 5 (A Method for Madness) & 6 (A Time for Treason) don't look like they will ever see daylight. I found the author's site where there is mention of a movie based on the series but I don't think it's going anywhere and he wouldn't reply to email.There is a special place in **** reserved for authors of unfinished series, David Gerrold claimed his with this one. I recommend against reading this, it's too painful to stop so abruptly. An incredible tragedy."
5,Amazing Insights and Advice for a Life of Prayer,"A good, homespun book on the practice of prayer. Margaret Guenther reminds us that prayer comes in many forms and can be practiced in many ways. From a complex rosary, novena or praying the hours in monastic style to centering prayer, to just an utterance of the Jesus prayer, or maybe a forelorn cry of ""help"", any time we communicate with God, it is a prayer. The book also discusses retreats, confession, intercessory prayer, group and communal prayer and worship, as well as other uniquely Christian elements of prayer and the mystical experience. She removes the fear of not praying ""right"", and instead gives practical ways to infuse prayer into a busy life. A good book, a good read, and one that will resonate with most busy people."
1,This book was problematic.,"Gould spends entirely too much time and effort describing Aikido moves. They become the focus of the work and draw attention away from the plot and characters. The Aikido terms are not well explained, nor are the moves(although excessively described)--this leaves these parts of the novel available only to people who have a working knowledge of the discipline. Many of the plot developments were facile at best, and the conclusion was not believable. Not a keeper!"
4,i liked it,"first off i don't know the slightest thing about martial arts so many of the detailed discriptions of the moves were lost on me, but it was my fault and not that of the author. i however found ths book to be very entertaining. even though the idea of a person being able to gain all the klowledge of history has been toyed with for longer than any one person can recall i have read few stories that handled with the fragile psyche of a person who has just gone through such an ordreal so well. i think that in itself makes this book a good read."
5,"As an Aikido student, this was very happy reading.","Speaking as Aikidoka -- a student of Aikido -- this book brought tears to my eyes. Happy tears, tears of remembrance of my own times on the mat. From the first utterance of ""Onaigashimasu..."" to the folding of the hakama, this was a complete, exact, and poignantly real depiction of what it is like to study Aikido. As Aikidoka say, this book has Ai-ki, harmonious energy. The philosophy of the martial art is woven delicately yet unswervingly through the plot, and everything balances at the end. A ""TV show ending?"" I think not. It simply did not bash the bad guys over the head like most stories. Instead, the characters followed the true principles of Aikido, the good guys using the energy of the bad guys to defeat them.Well done, Mr. Gould, if you read this...and I would be honored to practice with you, should you ever come into the dojo where I practice."
4,A quick read with both sci-fi and fantasy elements.,This is a book that I couldn't put down. It has both science fiction and fantasy elements and a plot that doesn't bog down in the middle. I thought the premise of an instrument that could imbue you with knowledge or be used to turn you into a mush-minded puppet was a good balance. It gives a good example of the possible pros & cons of experimental mental/biological technology. This was the first book of Steven Gould's that I read and I plan on checking out more of his work because I enjoyed this one so much.
2,Little Golden Books quality has plummeted,"I would have rather found an older version of this second hand because it would have been a better book. For one, the artwork of the older version was so much better. Secondly, the quality of Little Golden Books (now made in China) is very low. I doubt this one will last forever like some of the ones we have that were printed in the 70s. The only reason this got 2 stars is because the story itself is a good one."
5,Animal's Christmas Eve,"This was my daughter's favorite Christmas book, when she was growing up. It went out of print for several years and I am so glad it is back. I gave it to my grand nephews and grand niece this Christmas."
5,I was really happy to find this! My children had it when they were small.. I had to have it for My granddaughter!,"I was so Happy to find this book! I loved reading it to my children, and basically could remember the words from reading it so much! My daughter is an amimal lover from way back. Now a grown woman, and a vet tech, with a 6 year old daughter of her own, she got the pleasure of passing this story on. they read it at bed time, just like we used too. the art work is different, but the story rings true. I is just wonderful!!!!!"
3,NOT the original artwork,"I was dismayed to see that this item is not shipping with the original artwork, but rather with very colorful, stylized illustrations. The rhyme is exactly the same. I will try to post a picture of the new art. It's pretty in its own way, but lacking all the soft realism that was so charming about the original."
2,not for really severe diabetics,The product arrived quickly and well packaged. But it is an old book and uses the old carb exchange system. The recipies allowed for too many carbs for my severe diabetes. I use a much more stict carb level akin to an Atkins system. This book I passed on to someone wanting to cut carbs but not severely. Using these recipies I would have run sugars that would have been much too high. I think the book encompanses older thinking that recommended too many carbs. It was an official opinion but one many now disagree with. Not for me but might be OK for some or milder diabetics.
1,Cookbook Title is Misleading,"This cookbook is NOT low carb. The editorial statement says that in the book 1 carb equals 15g carbohydrate. Pa-lease, give us all a break, many low carbers do not use more than 20g carb per day...let alone 15g or more per meal."
2,"OK Book, But Missing Important Information","I have worked in the PR field for many years, but am new to nonprofits and found some interesting information in this book. However, the author does not even cover the aspects of PR that I consider essential to any PR program: working with the press, writing press releases, media events, getting the media to cover your events, etc. It discusses annual reports, newsletters, speakers bureaus and developing a board of directors (PR?), but nothing about traditional PR as it relates to nonprofits. It's almost like there is a missing chapter or maybe two."
3,Something different,"I have read nearly all of Gilbert Morris' books. I enjoy his writing, and this book is no different. The subject matter is different than many of his previous books, as it is set in modern times and involves the secular film industry. After a slow start, the book develops nicely. Several of the characters, particularly Mr. and Mrs. Frame, are quite enjoyable. While, not Gilbert Morris' best piece of work, on the whole it was an enjoyable evening's read for me. Probably not worth purchasing, but definitely worth a check-out from the local library."
1,"Fresh Air, No Laughs with Terry Gross","Surprisingly humorless interviews, given the title, all of which are serious, quite downbeat and just plain unfunny.Don't get me wrong: I can totally appreciate that comedians think it burdensome to have to be funny in their off-time, and that Ms. Gross's success is to a large extent attributable to her ability to put difficult to interview people at ease.That said, the title of this collection is misleading, as there are no laughs at all, really, just some mildly interesting conversations (and that is being quite generous). No great revelations either, if you are at all familiar with people interviewed.Disappointing, given the promising roster of comedians."
5,Great book!,Upper elementary students would benefit from this read-aloud. It is wonderful to see the intergenerational interactions and the beauty each generation is for the other. English-language-learners benefit from the helpful and warm relationships in the book. A book I am glad I own!
5,BRUSHY BELIEVER,"I REALLY ENJOYED THE BOOK. I BELIEVE BRUSHY WAS BILLY THE KID. THE DETAILS ABOUT CERTAIN EVENTS WHICH BRUSHY COULD RECALL WAS RATHER INCREDIBLE. I BELIEVE HIS CLAIMS. BRUSHY CAN NOT BE DISMISSED AS AN IMPOSTOR BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE WILL NOT ALLOW IT. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF BRUSHY WAS NOT BILLY THE KID THAT HE WOULD BE EASILY DISPROVEN. ITS ABOUT 50 YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH AND HE IS STILL BEING TALKED ABOUT. I HAD ALWAYS WONDERED WHY PAT GARRETT DID NOT HAVE THE CORPSE OF BILLY THE KID PHOTOGRAPHED. HE COULD HAVE VERY EASILY. I THINK THE ANSWER IS OBVIOUS. HE NEVER SHOT AND KILLED BILLY THE KID BECAUSE HE DIED AN OLD MAN IN HICO, TEXAS."
1,This book is based on the fantasy of a lunatic.,"Brushy Bill Roberts was an imposter. As a teenager, he claimed to be Jesse James. As an old man, he claimed to be Billy the Kid, but he couldn't speak Spanish while the real Billy was fluent, and he was too young to be the real Billy. Plus, to believe his story, you would have to believe that the two or three hundred residents of Fort Sumner who saw the real Billy laid out at his wake kept quiet, every last one of them, until they, too, joined Billy in the great hereafter. Anyone who believes Brushy Bill is as deluded as he was."
1,Not so good hair gel,This hair gel was disappointing. I'll not order it again and go back to Non-Scents. It didn't work well and is just a poor product.
2,Hair gel,This product is okay. Does not do as good a job as gel that bought at K-mart or Target for a less price.
4,Surprisingly good,"I figured a game devoted to one make of car would be less than other racing games. Surprisingly, the graphics are good. The biggest surprise of all though is the handling. It is remarkably realistic. Driving a '68 Mustang is completely different than a later model.It is also refreshing to play a racing game that doesn't try to superimpose a storyline onto gameplay that doesn't really need one.All in all, this game is definitely a must have for anyone who loves racing games and a fun game for anyone who enjoys good games."
4,Not as good as the seconed one.,"I liked the first one allot better than this one. Yes the graphics and sound is amazing and one of the best that the ps2 has made, but this game is VERY hard and i could not even get a fourth of the way done, my older brother could not either. It did not have any cheat codes so i could not even drive my favorite car. It has many more cars and places to go so it is worth the money if u can beat it. It has mostly every single popular ford made. Over 120 veichles total in this game too. It would be an excellent game if u could actually beat it. The graphics r great."
1,FORD RACING 3 DOES NOT WORK,"THIS GAME WAS SHIPPED AND RECEIVED IN AN EXCELLENT MANNER. HOWEVER, THE GAME WILL NOT PLAY. WE TRIED ON MY GRANDSON'S PLAYSTATION AND THEN AGAIN THIS WEEKEND ON MY PLAYSTATION. IT WILL NOT PLAY. I DON'T HAVE THE RETURN ADDRESS OF JO LOUIS LIMITED, SO I CANNOT RETURN IT. PLEASE HELP ME GET THAT ADDRESS, SO I CAN REQUEST AN EXCHANGE FOR ONE THAT PLAYS. THANKS"
5,Laughter and a little bit of insanity. . . .,"This somewhat obscure classic has been one of my favorite movies for a long time. Gregory Peck's ever-present dignity takes a beating as he woos lovely Claudette Colbert in his pajamas, in a bathtub and in a straitjacket. There may be some elements of the movie that wouldn't fly in these Politically Correct times, but that doesn't mean you can't laugh at them here! A must see!"
4,A Near Miss,"BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WIFE is a near-miss screwball farce. Claudette Colbert's undoing of her playboy husband Gary Cooper has some wonderfully humorous moments. But the parts are greater than the whole. However, if you watch this as a forerunner to the Cooper/Wilder masterpiece, LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON, made 20 years later, it is an extremely fascinating film. Wilder made LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON as a tribute to his idol, Ernst Lubitsch, who directed this. Cooper's jaded, aging roue works far better in AFTERNOON than here in BLUEBEARD, perhaps because screwball farce wasn't the right style for the plotline. That said, it is very much worth watching. It just isn't top-drawer, that's all."
4,Excellent English Grammar Textbook,"As a 9th grade student in Florida (1979), I used this particular edition of this book in my English class and have never forgotten how good it was. I plan to buy a copy to keep handy at work as soon as I can find one. I'm surprised at how often I wished I had a copy."
4,Simply excellent book,"If you have problem with your written english, this is the ultimate book. Just buy one and keep it with you."
5,This is a great book,"I had a chance to read this book in a book store, and I was nearly rolling on the floor laughing. Some of the ideas by the author were so bizarre, you couldn't help but laugh."
4,Great bio of a very complex person,"Mr Klien has done it again. I read Mr. Klein's The Life And Legend of Jay Gould with much anticipation and found it to be very engaging. That is exactly how i felt about his latest endeavor, The Life and Legend of E.H. Harriman. Mr. Klien handles a complex person with much skill and depth. He brings to life a monumental person who was both very complex and yet very human. His use of the social and cultural aspects of the era help to put his subject in context without detracting from the person. Many biographies fail either because the subject is dimmed by the amount of background information on the social and cultural aspects of the era or just the opposite, the subject is not brought to life by too little backgroung of the forces that helped shapped his/her life. Mr. Klein succeeds in reaching a great balance. The book is a great read."
4,great series. Didnt like the ending!,This is a great series. I didnt like the ending though. It was kind of blah compaired to the rest of the episodes. But I would definatly recomend this movie series.
5,ghostier,"HiFirstly many thanks to Amazon for their speedy delivery and stress free service for me to then sit and watch hours of one of my favourite programmes.This season seemed darker than the last..I still can not get use to Jim being Jim again not even a snippet of the actual body he is in.The skip to their lovely baby to a boy was probably expected it could have taken a lot of drawn out episodes to get Aiden to school.I enjoyed all of the episodes and it kept me entertained as usual and of course in tears in some.The turn around of Aiden saving his mum was good.Oh Melissa's fashion are always an interest to me, but why you would wear some of the things she does on a normal day is definately questionable.I certainly hope there is another season to come can anyone tell me???Enjoy everyoneBlondieoz"
5,I LOVE GHOST WHISPERER!!!!,"I CANT WAIT FOR THIS TO COME OUT! I want to own them all. I wish they didnt cancel the show! Big mistake, everyone I know loves this drama!"
3,No crazy about where the series is going,"I liked the first four seasons of Ghost Whisperer. The stories tended to focus on human relationships and left me feeling emotional at the end of each episode. By contrast, I'm not crazy about the direction of season 5. It seems like the show is investing a lot of energy and time with the whole battle between the ghosts and humans. The episodes have a much darker tone (and Jim has nearly dropped out). I honestly don't really care about the difference between shinys or shadows, or the book of revelations - I just want good drama. I hope the next season goes back to the Ghost Whisperer roots and drops a lot of this ghost sub-plot nonsense."
5,GHOST WHISPERER IS THE BEST SHOW EVER,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SHOW. I OWN EVERY SINGLE SEASON. CBS IS MAKING THE WORST MISTAKE! GHOST WHISPERER NEEDS TO STAY ALIVE AND KEEP PRODUCING. MELINDA GORDON AND SAM/JIM NEED TO HAVE A DAUGHTER IN THE 6TH OR 7TH SEASON AND KEEP THE SHOW GOING. THIS SHOW IS THE BEST! I CAN RE-WATCH EVERY SINGLE SHOW AND STILL GET ALL PUMPED UP AND EXCITED FOR WHAT IS COMING NEXT.
5,"Ghost Whisperer, Season 5, ""Birthday Presence""","Believing that the Ghost Whisperer series provided Realistic impressions of what a person who is Spiritually Gifted could experience, I have loved every episode I have watched. Hospitals do harbor a massive amount of spirits, especially in this day and age. This episode deals with one such presence that is tied to the play of its earthly death.Birthday Presence"
3,Lackluster Finale But a Few Mind Bending Episodes,"I liked the overall series and I may have had some greater expectations for the grand finale.I found most of the plots for the fifth season episodes, a bit cliched and somewhat silly.Their was an overuse of melodrama in a few episodes that made it just a ""corny"" soap opera or simply ridiculous.Any show on the paranormal with an emotional sub plot needs to be integrated and clever in its delivery. This lacked both.There were a few episodes that were a little creative and made you pause ,wondering it's possibility.I reccomend seeing this just for closure but this was not the best of the show and probably a sign why it left the air."
5,Love for Ghost Whisperer,I absolutely love this show. I own the first three seasons and I can watch them over and over again. I was really disappointed when CBS cancelled the show. I loved Professor Paine and was disappointed when they replaced him with Eli. I cried when Andrea died and when Jim died in the fourth season. I've loved Jennifer Love Hewitt ever since she was in I Know What You Did Last Summer and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer and I fell in love with this show. I watched it every Friday night. I want to get the fourth and fifth season and it will be complete. I also have the Ghost Whisperer Games that I love to play. Jennifer Love Hewitt is a beautiful and talented actress and hope she makes it in these shows that she's doing now. I hope that CBS will put the show back on the air. They have made a major mistake in cancelling it. Maybe all of Ghost Whisperer fans can get CBS to put it back on.
4,Ghost Whisperer 5th season,"After returning the first order of Ghost Whisperer 5th Season due to disc 1 not being in there and receiving 2 of disc 2, the second one that I received was correct and I did receive it very fast."
2,Get Flow instead,"This is a CD with remixes from the songs found on the Flow album. The Flow album was an excellent adventurous album, whereas this one is boring from beginning until the end. All the songs found on the album Flow have been rearranged, their raw inspiration has been stripped away, and an insepid beat kills the music off. I think it was a big mistake for Jim to have his music being sliced by others devoid of any imagination. This CD is just a dance club version of Flow, very, very disappointing.Hence the title of my review, let this cup pass you by, get Flow instead."
3,"these appear to be very strong, but NO ""Double locking pawl""","I returned these as they are advertised as having a ""Double locking pawl"". They have a single pawl and are not spring loaded. I called the manufacturer and they said someone made a mistake on the web page and they do not have a double pawl. I bought the set that has the ""Double Lock"" T46002A locally and saved a buck or two too."
4,Looks solid!!,"Purchased 2 pairs of these 6 ton jacks from Amazon. They look pretty solid, I have not had a chance to use them yet so I gave it 4 stars. I'm sure it will hold up both ends of my Honda CRV perfectly. I will use for minor repairs, brakes, tire rotation, etc."
2,Cheap,This product is exactly what you paid for...cheap. I bought it but never really used it because it just doesnt look that nice and is not user friendly.
3,~Ashley's Review~,"Eunice and Joy are best friends. They do everything together and you can never find one without the other. Joy and Eunice decide to start a catering buisness for the summer. It's called Have Your Cake. Everything was going great, they were recieving orders left and right. One day Eunice and Joy go to the pool. Eunice notices that a boy has been watching Joy dive. When she informs Joy of this Joy says she doesnt care. However, the next day Eunice realizes Joy has bought a new swimming suit. Joy starts staying at practice late and leaving all work hours to Eunice. Joy starts spending time with Robert and leaving Eunice by herself."
2,down home country,"Somehow I expected something different from this album after reading reviews. It is a modest, rootsy country album with plaintive, emotional vocals. On the other hand, the playing is a bit rudimentary and the production by Chris Stamey is not up there with his best work. This young band has potential to be better than this. They also need to cheer up a little."
5,Great Classic Horror film,If you enjoy the old black & white horror classics from Universal Studios in the 1930's and 1940's - you won't be disappointed.Good copy of an old movie - and prompt delivery by a reliable supplier.You can't go wrong.
4,A Good Trifle of A Movie,"Don't expect to see a great horror flick when you watch 'The Ghoul'. It is not one of Universal's best efforts, but it does have a certain atmosphere to it, and George Zucco is always worth watching.A tasty little bon-bon of a movie. Not great by any means, but far from a 'worthless piece of tripe', to paraphrase another reviewer. Entertaining and worth a watch."
2,Nearly all advertising,"This video contains very little practical information. Indeed, it is perhaps 95%+ advertising for Clark custom guns and parts. The videography was well done, but overall this DVD is a ripoff, and not worth the $25 I paid for it."
3,The 1972 VHS version captured more of the love story in the book,"Although the acting, special effects, story details, plot, and such in this version were ages ahead of the 72 version, the 72 version captures more of the Love Story between the two friends.I especially liked the music in the 1972 version, and the feel it gave me about the story between the friends, and the cold feeling of the War. When I watched the 72 version I cried, and almost could feel like I was there with Phiny and Gene, and a war was going on. After I watched the 2004 verison I felt nothing. Actually I was anxiously awaiting the film to end, so I could watch a few Twilight Zone masterpieces I recorded onto VHS.Although I will not rate this version lower than 3 stars, I think its missing the musical score, realism, and capture of the love story between the friends found in the 1972 version."
2,A bit on the lame side,"This is one of those movies where the book is so much better. It's a coming of age tale, in a more innocent vein than, say, ""The Catcher in the Rye."" It gets a bit sacharine here and there, not to mention slightly homoerotic. Not a waste, but not a real winner, either."
2,Not a Classic despite the book source,"Well, it's better than the original 1972 film starring Parker Stevenson. The photography is clean and crisp and most of the actors seem age-appropriate for their roles (witness all the ""teenagers"" on TV played by actors who are clearly pushing 30). But Knowles over-rated book does not make a good movie and the acting is stilted and hammy. If you can get this for five bucks, including shipping, it might be worth it. Or see if you can rent it from your local library."
2,OK Moview,"I used this movie for a high school English class. The students thought the acting was really bad, but I was happy that it stayed true to the story."
2,"Okay, but not terrific-wow!","This follows the John Knowles novel pretty closely, but it was one of the slowest videos since my high school history class documentaries. If you haven't read the novel, you won't enjoy this movie."
1,Classic Book Totally Trashed By Filmmakers,"This adaptation of John Knowles' classic WWII era prep school novel is just awful. The first indication of this is when the actor playing the narrator ""Gene"" goes through about five different accents in the first ten minutes. Unnecessary changes to the book have been made and I really don't think the filmmakers even understood the novel's major themes. I haven't seen the version that was made in the 70's but understand it is a better film and frankly it has to be better than this attempt. I can see it would be difficult for a film to capture the complete essence of A SEPARATE PEACE but don't waste your time watching this mess."
3,*Pretty good*,"I would second that review of 3 stars. I bought this album after seeing the video for ""We are not a rock band"" on mtv2. I am a little bit disappointed because that video rocks and so does the song. To then go and listen to the album is then kind of a letdown. Don't get me wrong, this is an interesting record with definite high points, but its not great. My favorite song is ""Freestyle Disco""...its like how-to-dance instructions mixed over a heavy beat that gets progressively louder and faster (to increase the difficulty as the dancer gets better)...pretty cool idea. It has the same light-hearted, fun vibe that ""We are not a rock band"" does. There are lulls in the album though, a lot of the same heavy baselines tend to run together. I do like this album however; its great to throw on if you're driving, or like me right now sitting at the computer kicking back. I'd say burn it before you buy it though."
3,Has some good moments...,"The rub of this CD is that most of the music was created on a PC using various software programs. Kraftwerk is a heavy influence here but there are smatterings of other influences such as a bit of hip hop. ""We are Not A Rock Band"" is the standout track and has hit potential in the club scene. I hear the video has gotten some airplay on MTV2 so I'm a little amazed that no one has reviewed this album yet. Most of the music would be categorized as electronica. No trance or house stylings here. It's an interesting listen as the music is mostly digitally generated. The liner notes are written in the manner of a coporate seminar which further flesh's out the artist's hi-tech vision. The final track has a memorable chorus ""we are not a rock band/but we rock the house"" sung through a vocoder."
4,Blizzard the White Tiger,"This is part of a Christmas gift I bought for a fellow Bengals fan in my office. I will have to buy another for another Bengals fan. I plan to put this in a Bengals stocking as soon as I find one. Don't read too much into the whole stars rating. To me they are not educational and I don't intend to play with them, that is whyI rated them so low in thos categories but high overall."
4,A Grimey Griot for the 21st C,"Madlib lays down some extraordinarily grimey beats for this blessed-out brotha from anotha motha. There is NOTHING else that sounds like this, and it might be too experimental for some folks. Nevertheles, anyone who likes hip hop that dares to be different and true at the same time needs to check this ish out. Think Outkast mixed with ODB, Sun Ra, Gil-Scott H. and a dash of Primo thrown in and you peep the crazy steelo here. If you tire of Dudley P's nasal flow (which I haven't) seek out the instrumentals on vinyl."
4,"So funky, so dirty","This is what Cody C. wants to be when he grows up. This is true dirty funk. Buy this right after you buy ""Shades of Blue"" by Madlib, actually save up your lunch money and buy both albums at the same time."
5,A summer delight!,"Okay, so it's a mystery and I'm supposed to be scared...but I found myself laughing out loud all the time. I thought ""This Pen for Hire"" was hilarious, but ""Last Writes"" tops it. A perfect beach read...unless you don't mind getting burned...as you won't put this Jaine Austen mystery down until you reach the very last period. Not for a minute did I guess the ending. Can't wait for round three from this new, exciting, witty and very talented writer, Laura Levine."
3,Kind of Ho Hum,"I was pretty disappointed in this new Jaine Austen Mystery. I really liked the first one, but this one just kept me wanting more, and not really more as in another book, but more in this one. I'm not saying don't read it, but maybe wait for the paperback or borrow if from a friend. However, I will read the next one I'm sure, because I really like this character and hope that the next one will be the ""more"" I'm waiting for."
4,Light hearted but didn't know how to end it,"This is an easy read, but the author had trouble ending the book. I may read more by the same author, but I think I'll keep looking."
5,Fast and Fun,"This second book in Laura Levine's ""Jaine Austen"" mysteries is a delight from cover to cover. It's a page turner, and delivers what it advertises: humor and sparkling wit. In this book, Jaine writes a sitcom script and works on the studio lot with best pal, Kandi, while it's being produced. Of course someone is killed. Kandi is blamed, and Jaine tries to clear Kandi so goes a-sleuthing. Just as entertaining as the first book, Ms. Levine gives us laugh-out-loud fun. She is GOOD."
2,Not very good,"I'm giving this book only 2 stars for 2 reasons:1. It's really not very good. I'm comparing this to Janet Evanovich and Joanne Fluke who do this genre SO much better than this writer. I laughed once at the humor; the other attempts at humor were pretty ""lame"" as is the writing. It got old really fast that the lead character would seem to be saying something, only to have the quote followed up with how that's what she was thinking, she really said... And what she actually said was something spineless. Jaine Austen (what a dreadful name; is it supposed to be clever?) is not a character to particularly admire.2. There was a blatant ad for the first book right in middle of the story. (""buy it now in paperback"") Perhaps it was only in my Nook ebook, but I found that pretty pathetic."
5,Great read!,This is a book that is hard to stop readiing. I can't count the times I laughed out loud! I couldn't figure out the ending. Very clever and fun book. I can't wait for the next one!
3,Not for all applications but wifi world is great,"This antenna did not work for my application, but what impressed me was the action of wifi world. When they saw I was displeased with my review, they called me, gave me suggestions, and when that did not work, they refunded completely, including shipping, and even sent me a postage paid package to sent it back to them in.This antenna did not improve my connection, but it probably would in some instances. However, if you buy from wifi world, they will make it good."
1,Don't Bother,I don't know whether I just got a faulty pair (they are going back!) but what is the point of cordless headphones that have a very limited range and constantly cut out when you move?
1,What you see is NOT what you get.,I was looking for an L-type plug with a female plug on the opposite end that would fit my PX100's. I wanted an L-type plug coming out of my player.For some reason Koss has replaced the L-type plug that evidently used to be in this package ( the package is fitted for an L-type ) with a straight plug.Obviously not what I thought I was getting. If you specifically want the L-type plug this is not it.
3,Dual Connector,"Works okay for what I am using them for, but they did not come in like the picture. They were not the 90 degree angle, and they were the straight connector."
2,"Works, but is not the product pictured","This connector arrived in Koss retail packaging, but it does not have chrome-plated connectors, and the 1/8 inch stereo end is straight, not a right angle connector. I need to use this right away and can't wait while I return it; it does function as it should, but I wanted the product as pictured, with the gold plating and right angle."
1,NOT what is pictured,"i suppose this works as a coupler. BUT, the product i received is not what is pictured, which is the only reason i bought it: a L-type RIGHT-ANGLE plug to two jacks.The product has a straight plug, not the right-angle plug as pictured--if that is what you want (like me) then look elsewhere!!"
3,Spicy,"This is an interesting mix - the ""top note"" is great, but disappears rapidly (can someone enlighten me as to what it is?). You are then left with the smell of a curry-house...Try the sample first - a good Chicken Jalfrezi may be less expensive."
3,Repetitive but Newer,"Like the first edition, this is the only series I found that actually narrates a tour of different places in New Zealand.The biggest plus of the second edition is that it contains new material from the 2000s. However, about 30% of the film is copied directly from the much older first edition.This host is more entertaining and less annoying than the first editions."
4,Excellent Book!,"I love the books about Franny K. Stine. They are soooooooo funny. Franny does the craziest experiments. She is very smart and kind of nice. If you like books about crazy things, you'll like this book!"
2,very disappointing,"author seems to be in love with her own prose at the expense of telling an actual story. Talent is evident, but her stylized efforts at creating evocative effects were far too obvious."
4,Western Asceticism,"This was book was in very good shape when it arrived, which was quickly. The type is a little toosmall. Anyway it is packed with many stories of the fathers, which should interest the Christianscholar. A very dense collection of sayings."
4,Nice Introduction to the early Church,"Hinson provides a nice summary model for introductory work in the history of early Christianity. This book is easy to read, makes it points well, and doesn't try to do too much as an introduction work. If you're verses in the history of the early Church to any extent, this book is not for you. However, if you're looking for something to start your education in historical Christian faith, this book is a very nice resource."
2,This book needs chronology and an index!,"While I found this book to be interesting, it was hard to follow and it most definitely needs an index!"
5,Hysterical fast paced insanity,"I loved this book! You feel like you're in a surreal alternate world where all things Florida around you. And they're pretty bizarre.One thing that I realized is that this is the authors 2nd book. Several of the characters in this book were from the authors first book. Had I read the books out of sequence, I would have missed some of the connections completely.And if I did have to pick on the book at all, it's that the author introduces so many characters that it's almost a brain teaser to figure out who they are and how they relate. When he's introducing A, B & C, switches to plot line D, introduces characters, E, F & G and then lets G meet A, it gets confusing. It definitely prompted me to read for longer periods to keep the characters straight in my head.Still a great read."
4,Okay,I enjoyed this book even though I felt some parts were too long winded and that there were too many characters to keep track of. At some points I lost track of the plot and couldn't find the point. Overall though an enjoyable read. I will read others by Dorsey.
1,Don't pay full price for this paperback,"This is not Dorsey's best work. He's introduced too many characters and we only know a few facts about each. The story darts around like the ball in a pinball machine. If you are stuck in an airport and someone leaves this book in the lounge, go ahead and pick it up. Otherwise, go pay full price for a Carl Hiassen novel in the bookstore."
5,I Want More,"Well, Dorsey did it again! He wrote a novel that made the kids wait for their dinner. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. I'd fall asleep holding it, only to awaken, pick it up, and start reading again!Tim weaves a tale that hosts characters that I swear I know. Their madcap adventures which trail up and down the Florida interstates and sideroads have kept me laughing time and time again. With each new read, I discover something about each of them I didn't know. Dorsey definitely paints characters who ARE characters. I also recommend reading Florida Roadkill before sinking into Hammerhead Ranch Motel. Although you'll get to know each character at the Ranch, you'll feel like you've met up with old friends if you've read Roadkill first.I can't wait for Orange Crush. I'm definitely a Dorsey fan. He takes me away from my safe, mundane Floridian existence and immerses me in a darker side of Sunshine that entertains.Thanks, Tim!"
3,Non Stop Action From the first page to the last!,"I enjoyed this book as well as the other Dorsey books. They meet one of my requirements for a good action movie.... action from start to finish. No lead in, let's just get this story rolling.I live in florida, but am a seattle native so i like some of the florida insight the books provide, even if they are only partially true!"
2,"Okay airplane reading, could use a decent editor","Hammerhead Ranch Motel is a raucous story filled with colorful characters and locales. Unfortunately, it often has too much color and Dorsey really seems to be trying too hard to impress us with his knowledge of Florida lore and history, and his ability to deliver eccentric situations and characters. The ending ties things together messily, but at least has more coherence than the beginning. The exerpt of his forthcoming books suggests that his capacity for good writing may yet overcome his talent for showing off."
5,A hectic storm within a huricane.,"This is Tim Dorsey's sequel to Florida Roadkill. Serge Storms is back in this book still chasing the suitcase containing $5 Million in laundered drug-money. Early in the novel Serge gets his hands on the case, just to lose it to car thieves. The case continues to transfer hands until it makes it to the hands of drug-lord Zargozsa. The owner of the Hammerhead Ranch Motel. We follow Serge as he kills his way along the route taken by the case and meets up with zany companions along the way. The plot reaches its climax as the protaganists gather in the bar of the Hammerhead Ranch to wait out a hurricane and see who will end up with the cash."
5,Dorsey hits it on the head,"Hiassen wanna be or perhaps wanna be his sidekick, or perhaps IS an author making his way in his own right! Floridian farces mixed with Marx Brother scenarios which will keep you smiling if not laughing out loud. We all really aren't such Floridiots though :-)"
5,Get Hammered!,"I think I liked this even better than Florida Roadkill, and that's going some. The overall level of lunacy remains the same, but as another reader mentioned, it seems Dorsey reined things in a bit during the second half of this one. Pieces fell together tighter than a jigsaw puzzle. If you haven't read Florida Roadkill, I'd recommend it before taking on Hammerhead-although this could definitely stand on its own. And if you haven't seen Key Largo-or don't remember it that well-watching it before reading Hammerhead Ranch will enhance the high."
4,Just as funny the second time around.,Characters too real. These people are out there. Serge is one messed up dude you might actually imagine hanging with for a weekend. Anything longer might get you arrested.
1,not very funny... weird!,"From all the reviews I read, I thought this would be a laugh out loud book, but it wasn't. I think I got a giggle twice. It was full of weird characters, with weird situations but not much of a plot... I was very dissappointed. I only read it to the end to see if the ending would be better and would tie everything together... some loose ends were tied up in the end... but with no great shakes for an ending. very weird!"
1,Not for any Annie Ross JAZZ fan,"NOT for fans of Annie Ross, at least those of us who prefer her in jazz settings. Annie Ross on this soundtrack is like hearing Ella Fitzgerald with a polka band, it just doesn't work. If you're an Annie Ross(jazz)fan look long and hard for ""Sings A Song With Mulligan"" which was available in the early 90's on CD through Bethlehem. Now you have to find it used, you may have better luck finding it on LP. Also get w/L,H&R ""The Swingers"" ""Sing A Song Of Basie"" ""Flying high With"" ""The Hottest New Group In Jazz"" and ""Sing Ellington."" As for this washed up pop album(soundtrack), of her sounding like Bette Midler or someone with no artistic value, stay away from it and get the albums mentioned above for a truly artistic jazz side of the talented Annie Ross."
5,The Last Apology,"There was a time when men-in America at least- had to pretend certain things about food. There were canonical prefences-steaks, bourbon, eating beans directly from the can. There were also aversions: fuss, vegetables,anything called a sauce. All these pretenses were the real barriers to actually enjoying food and so of course there were men who defied them, but didn't really want to lose their masculinity merit badge in the process.Welsch's good old boy cred is entirely intact-he even has a picture of a grill and an outhouse on the cover of his book, but he's showing the beginnings of a real interest in the way things taste. I cannot imagine a better gourmet book club choice for a men's club-we can laugh or for a woman's- they can gather ammunition.The Foreword is by Jim Harrison whose ownThe Raw and the Cooked: Adventures of a Roving Gourmandis still one of the best books about men and food.Lynn Hoffman, author of bang BANG"
1,A terrible book on lions.,"If you want a terrific book on mountain lions, then please read Soul Among Lions by Harley Shaw. I have read every book on lions and his is the only one worth reading. Most of the authors in Shadow Cat are easterners who have moved to Montana or California, displacing numerous wildlife species with their cabin in the wilderness and who have never even seen a lion, let alone have any kind of authority to provide insight into any aspect of lion ecology. The book is biased toward anti-hunting and environmentalism and doesn't portray an accurate picture. If you are a granola who likes to blame loggers and hunters for your own ineptness then you may like this book. They let Wayne Pacelle have the parting shot in this book, and well if that doesn't throw up a big red flag then you're probably dumb enough to want to read Shadow Cat."
2,too subtle,"Every February, I go and get the latest BAE. After the diversity of the series, i.e. het/gay, male/female, various races, various behaviors, I was really disappointed with the selection in this edition.There's not nearly enough explict scenes for me. Rather, the focus of these stories, with a few exceptions, seems to be beating around the bush (no pun intended). I didn't find many stories I wanted to read again and again, completely unlike all the other BAEs.As far as I'm concerned, for the money, Herotica 6 is more worth my time."
1,Coasting,"Too little true erotic content, too much of an attempt to reach for the literary, without the stories being good enough to hold up a literary fiction book. It ends up a bit dull, and quite forgettable. Sheiner's Best Women's Erotica series is doing a much better job of staying modern _and_ hot. Susie Bright's coasting here on past success, which makes the book not worth the time."
2,THIS IS NOT THE BEST OF AMERICIAN EROTICA,"TO SAY THAT THIS IS THE BEST AMERICAN EROTICA FOR 2001, IS FALSE ADVERTIZING. THE NEED TO REMOVE THE EROTICA PART IN THE TITLE. iT IS VERY BLAND, I HAVE READ A LOT OF THE ""EROTICA"" BOOKS, AND THIS COMES NO WHERE NEAR IT.IF YOU LIKE EROTICA TRY ""THE HOT BLOOD SERIES"",""BEAUTY'S PUNISHMENT & BEAUTYS RELEASE, BY Anne Rice"", ARE JUST A FEW OF THE BEST."
2,Putting Green Mouse Pad,The cost was too high for the quality and took a very long time to receive the item.
5,Perfect,"Came quickly, a breeze to build. My five-year-old actually helped build it and did a lot of it himself. Other good thing- this coat rack has low pegs as well as high ones, which makes it easier for the littler ones to hang up/get stuff down. A lot of them only seem to have the coat pegs up at the top."
2,Interesting but wrong,"Yes, this book offers the most complete investigation of Tippit murder. But Myers, reaches all the wrong conclusions."
5,No Doubt Here!,"Mr. Myers has performed a great service to all students and researchers of the Kennedy assassination phenomenon. This superbly researched volume is not only filled with valuable information, but it is one of the most handsome books I have ever had the pleasure to read. It contains photographs and images not previously seen and the way it flows won't let you put it down. If there was any doubt in anyone's mind about who killed Officer Tippit before, WITH MALICE should solve that mystery. We all have our own opinions about ""Who killed JFK?"", but Mr. Myers' book answers the question, ""Who killed J. D. Tippit?"" Read the book - you will understand."
1,Doesn't prove a thing to me.,I don't care if they found Oswald's wallet at the scene. It still doesn't explain why the cops found another wallet in his possession when he was arrested at the theatre. Two Oswald wallets? Sounds like one was planted at Tippet's murder. No?Conspiracy.
1,Whitewash,"Complete hokum. Appallingly written and incredibly naive. Packed with misinformation and increasingly absurd speculation. Given the author's selective blindness and disregard for the facts which do not support his flag-waving,God Bless America thesis,he would have been a sterling member of the Warren Commission. Avoid at all costs."
1,Rosetta Stone,"It sure seemed to me that Oswald killed Tippet. He looked like a killer in those pictures.That is why I thought he was guilty for some 25 years. And I came to the conclusion that if he killed Tippet he had to have killed Kennedy.Now, since I am 100% convinced that he did not kill Kennedy (he couldn't have shot Kennedy in the neck and temple from behind him) , it works the other way.Therefore, if he didn't kill Kennedy, he had no reason to kill Tippet. And it is an obvious part of the framing process."
2,Wrong item,"When I bought this item, which was clearly labeled a PS2 controller, I received a PS3 controller instead. That was a disappointment. I don't know if it was a typo in the item description or not, but I'm not pleased by this."
3,Another side of Jet Li,First I thought I was going to see a movie about the slave conditions in the U S. It came to pass it turned out to be a good action movie. With Morgan's daughter not being the best one cast. Forgiving that Morgan basically walked through his role -- Jet Li picked up the slack.The man can act -- very good and Morgan even walking throught a role - lends a wonderful feeling to any film stock.
1,quality of video was absolutely awful,"The quality of the video was awful. The frame was stay frozen for approximately 10, 15 minutes, then move one or two frames, then freeze again. I could not watch the movie. And I have Xfinity, so my broadband is excellent. (Also have Netflix streaming which never has a problem.)"
5,Jet li movie,This movie is action pack with lots of fighting and kick ass scenes and the best thing is the fun never stops
4,twist,"I so enjoyed this film. Often movies with that much violence turn me off, but this one tuned me in with a tender side. A story about a family pulling together instead of falling apart is inspiring, even more so when biology has nothing to do with the beauty that can come together with a kind gesture and fingers coming into contact with piano keys."
3,"Grim. No, really grim","Well one thing we learn in ""Unleashed"" is that unlike Chuck Norris, Jean Claude Van Damme and others, Jet Li perhaps can act. The soft parts where he learns of his mother, her music, and his first kiss (""hmmm. wet. hmmm. nice) under the tutelage of Morgan Freeman show some nice movement and facial expressions.The other thing we learn is that he may be the best of the martial arts fighters, Mr. Van Damme having put on a little width, Mr. Chan having just turned to what only can be termed as martial vaudeville, and Mr. Norris, well Chuck's hung up his spurs.But the movie is so bloody grim that who would want to see it much less buy it? Bob Hoskins, not just evil but stupidly so, and his entourage of baseball carrying thugs and smarmy gunslingers. There's a plot here somewhere and it ain't Pygmallion.So, if you like the fights it's probably worth it. Not much else. 3 stars. Larry Scantlebury"
1,I love Jet Li but I hate this movie,"This is one of those movies where you know 2-5 minutes into it, it's going to be a stupid flick. And you know what- it delivers on that on sooo many levels. I think what bothered me about it is the movie tried to have heart. It's almost like a plot was trying to form about halfway through the movie.Bob Hoskins and Morgan Freeman were too great for this film- very weird to see them stoop down to such a dumb, violent film.Jet Li can be seen in better fight scenes from Once Upon A Time In China, Forbidden Kingdom, Fearless, Hero and even Romeo Must Die."
5,Jet Li's Best Performance,"This film although is quite slow..still has a brilliant feel good popcorn entertaining storyline with great martial arts as usual..and jet li does serious acting with style..(Im a big fan of bruce lee, jackie chan, tony jaa, jet li)..jet li does the best serious acting..apart from enter the dragon-bruce lee"
4,Surprisingly great...,"I am a martial arts fan so tend to rent these flicks whether they are good or bad. I was very surprised in the following:1) Very good acting2) A very good, although predictable, plot--it actually has drama, which is odd for this type of film3) Fight scenes were superb (I played the unrated version)Overall, I recommend this movie from both a martial arts perspective and from a action movie perspective. It actually combines elements of a drama, but it is still classified as an action movie."
3,Identity Crisis,"This movie suffers from an identity crisis. It doesn't know if it wants to be a ""feel good"" movie or a martial arts movie. The parts about Sam and Victoria were touching, but they seemed out of place with the violent fighting elements.Also, the fact that Danny was a slave to his ""uncle"" seemed unbelievable. It's hard to believe that a grown man could be that docile unless he was mentally impaired. Danny wasn't completely isolated, he saw the outside world and I think that he would rebelled a long time ago.My last comlplaint is that the death of Danny's mother was never fully explained. Why exactlty was she killed? She was a young and talented piano prodigy. Why would she be mixed up with those thugs? Where was Danny's father during all this? And most of all, how in the world was the uncle able to live through that horrendous car accident and shooting? I can suspend disbelief at times, but this movie was asking too much!I have no idea why so many people liked this movie."
4,martial arts drama,"Finally, Jet Li has a movie that displays his acting talents. Everyone knows he is close to fantastic when it comes to action sequences, but in this movie, he plays someone who has been trained to be a killer and to shut off emotion. I like the lead characters or hero to have weaknesses, something the character has to overcome. Li does a very a very good job at best. The fight scenes are great, and the acting by the other members of the cast is not bad. Morgan Freeman helped Li along the slow parts of the movie.This is an action flick with emotion, not as good as KISS OF THE DRAGON or HERO, but BETTER than THE ONE, BLACK MASK. I'm buying the DVD when it comes out."
4,Very underrated!,"I'm not a big fan of Jet Li but I actually enjoyed this film alot! The fight scenes are very brutal and aren't like most other martial arts movie. Li actually acts in this flick and is supported by a strong cast, Morgan Freeman and Bob Hoskins. Luc Besson was clearly behind this project and it shows through the story telling. Also very stylistic effects. The movie isn't perfect but it's worth checking out."
4,great action movie,"I went to see this movie in the theater, it wasn't what I was expecting but the story and action were done really well. Jet Li did a super job portraying the main character which is a pretty big thing since the character is pretty hard to portray well in my opinion. It has a great story and message thrown in with the great martial arts."
4,Unleashed,"On and beneath the meanest streets of Glasgow, fiery gangster Bart is merciless with debtors, would-be rivals, and anyone else to whom he takes even a passing dislike. How does Bart maintain his chokehold? Through his unwitting enforcer Danny, who he has ""raised"" since boyhood. Danny has been kept as a near-prisoner by his ""Uncle"" Bart; trained to attack and, if necessary, kill. The story is modest, the drama direct. This movie has unique special effect of martial arts mastery in action."
3,jet li unleashed,"True jet li fans will apperciate this movie, the story drags at point but the fight scenes make up for it."
1,Unleashed,"If I had seen it at the movies I would have asked for my money back! No climax, bad storyline and acting. The initial fight was the only decent fight scene in the whole movie."
2,"save your time, watch the music videos","what a snooze (jet li grocery shopping!)Save your time and just watch the 2 music videos on the DVD instead. The massive attack one has almost all the fight scenes on it without any of the painful ""plot"" scenes."
2,THIS MOVIE IS REALLY LAME AND STUPID!!,"This is one of the worst movies of the year. A guy acts and eats and carries around like a DOG, with collar around his neck, and waits he collar off and he jump on the people??/what the hell??And then show him how to talk and love and eats like human? What the hell is this?? is like slavery and raciest movie.Try putting a American African instead ""JET LI "" in this movie. I bet would never be release even straight to DVD, if u knows what I mean. B.S, Skip this trash!!.Dont waste ur time or money!"
1,The worst movie I've ever seen,"I would give NO star if there's an option. The story line is very very BAD. I didn't see much of the fighting...maybe only 1 or 2. Even the Karate Kid did fight more!! People who like this movie probably don't know any better about martial art or Just like Jet Li ...no matter what he does. Please try Tony Jaa movies, ""Onk-Bak"", Muey Thai Warrior. It's the best....well before the ""Tom Yum Goong"" or Onk-Bak part II released. He's the only one who use No stunts."
1,Lousy Li,"Not at all what i thought it would be like based on other jet li movies. He is a good actor, but this movie is gross and hard to follow much less understand. Surprised Morgan Freeman got involved in this one."
4,Jet Li should win an academy award,"Let's admit it, Jet Li and Steven Segal have no shot at an award but as concerning acting alone Jet was amazing. If Mel Gibson or Tom hanks played this role they would be winning an award for such a well done performance. Martial artist in general are not well known for their acting but it would do Hollywood well to look down once and while and see that there are some fine actors in other fields. Actors, like with any profession can improve their skills. Jet Li is proof a martial artist does not have to be known solely for his physical abilities, he played the role of Danny with near perfection. Maybe this was the right script for Jet. I highly recommend this movie, great storyline and the funny part is I was actually disappointed with lack of fighting. I would watch Jet fight for 55 minutes of a 60 minute movie but this movie has a story with character development etc... I will give it four stars for too much story and not enough fighting. LOL"
4,NOT YOUR RUN OF THE MILL MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE,"I am not a fan of martial arts films and I have not seen any other Jet Li movies. I did watch and enjoy this film. Morgan Freeman lends a helping acting hand as a blind piano tuner who befriends the animal like Li. A cool fish out of water story and great brutal action sequences in this crazy mix of action/comedy/drama. Kind of like ""Mortal Combat"" meets ""The Miracle Worker"" LOL! Check this one out! ;-b"
4,A new genre: emotionally moving martial arts films!,"I like action films. I like films that move me emotionally...never thought I'd find both in one film, but UNLEASHED does it! Jet Li actually acts -- to good effect--as his Danny comes alive under the tutelage of Morgan Freeman, one of the brilliant actors of our time.Highly recommended!"
5,"A great, compelling story","When I first saw Unleashed, I was not expecting this movie to be as sentimental as it was. Yes the fights are brutal and bone jarring but the ""warm"" parts in the movie made this movie a jewel in its own right. Not everyone is a Jet Li fan and for those that are, we expected an all out fight to the death type of movie but when the mood of the story turns, the acting turns very warm, sentimental, giving you a fuzzy feeling inside at the simplicity of Danny's life and the hardships he now faces. Morgan Freeman literally helped the story along, being more of a father than a friend to Danny and being well natured as he is, he helped bring out the humanity Danny had been missing in his life along with Kerry Condon helping in discovering his true self. This is a well made movie, more of a joy to watch than anything else."
3,It is what it is,"OK . I listen to everything you do. And you either like Icey or you don't. How do I describe him to those who have never heard him? Breakdance music. Or at least that's what he started out as. On this release, he has definetley evolved, but there are still momenets of big-time cheese to be sliced. My favorite release from Icey is ""Continuous Play,"" which isn't available too many places. I would rate this higher if it weren't so all over the map. But, if you like Icey, you'll like it."
4,Funkdified Sounds,"Icey really went kinda crazy when he made this cd.Im sure he was tweaking or something,because of these crazy ass sounds and funkdified beats he came up with!I dont think it could possibly get more funkier than this =-)Not everyone will enjoy this,in fact only if you are a true dance music lover,you should get this"
3,I've heard better from Icey,My title says it all..not enuff breaks and bass..it starts off cool.then it goes on a weird trip..and i love icey...i got all his stuff...but this waaay below his normal mixes.which is axtually what saves this cd..its a good mix..its jus the tracks that disapoint
1,Sorry Icey,"while his ""essential mix"" was worth a listen or two,this one is monotonous, same breaks over breaks.. this album sounds like a little kid having fun scratching the turntable for the first time.how can someone listen this for 65-70 min straight?truly and madly disapointed because i know how good DJ Icey is live.."
4,"funky, funky breaks",This is an incredibly good cd. It has lotsa bass with almost no songs. The only set back is with all that bass it's hard to dance to. It's great for cruisin or just chillin.
5,Tearing up the club,"Icey, you have done it again...Listening to the CD for the first time outside in the parking lot of Sam Goody stopped my heart. Icey did it again and evolved just enough to show that he is versatile and will never back down. When he caught a little flak for his first Essentials CD for spinning too mainstream, he said ""screw you"" and popped this one out. The perfect blend of underground and electro acid beats that have still not lost their audible flavor after 200 times in my stereo. Let's put it this way, 20 of my friends who absolutely hate techno or maybe even don't care for it, immidiately change their mind when I play some of Icey's stuff from MIXED, and his Essentials albums. If he can turn eventhem into liking tecno, he has got a gift and an ear for music. Keep on spinnin' Icey and hopefully I will get to your shows in the DC area."
4,Excellent product!,"This product is excellent. Why i didn't rate five stars? Because you can't program a day of the week. You can only make a 24 hours program to be repeated.Easy to install, easy to program.I'm using this to turn on my water heater before i wake up, so i can sleep for half hour more a day."
3,Let There Be Light!,"Never come home to a dark house - this was my plan. My electrician psuedo-son installed this gizmo and programmed it and that went very well. He even convinced me to have it on 'til ten ""in case you have a late night."" Well, it has come in handy once or twice, but mostly I love this on those evenings when it is dark when I walk home from the bus stop. When it stopped working and I thought I'd have to reprogram the thing, I nearly cried. The instructions are confusing and not well written, not to mention you need a magnifying glass to read them. But then a lightbulb lit up in my head and when I changed the lightbulb on the porch, I was saved! Let there be light, automatic light."
3,I wouldn't use it for a pool,"I purchased this timer switch to use with my pool pump because the description said it could be used with Pools and Hot tubs. When I opened the package, I noticed that the pigtail on the timer was 16 gauge wire. My Pool circute is wired with 12 gauge wire. I'm sure this could be used with smaller pool pumps, but it just wasn't going to work with my 1 HP pump. Fortunately, Amazon was extremely easy to deal with."
1,Dead in a week,Installed this to control 2 exterior CFL fixtures (26 total watts). It worked for about a week and then died.For all the hassle it is to get one of these installed and programmed I'd definitely look elsewhere. It's not worth the risk.
5,"Salinas, pure gold","I am so sad in Italy I couldn't find more from this incredible guitar player because this cd is absolutly spectacular. Salinas mesh beautifully Jazz with argentinean music and the result is really enjoyable. From a technical standpoint Salinas has the chops to outplay everyone in the biz but he has musical taste, he uses his abilities to communicate not to show off. The music is a little commercial here and there (it is produced by Tommy LiPuma, known for producing a lot of George Benson and Miles Davis albums) but the overall quality of the cd is consistently high. In the end this album is really uplifting and emotional. I listen to this one a lot. Salinas's guitar let me dream and think to the girl I love. GOLD."
5,If you like Diana Krall you'll like this!,"If you are a jazz & latin jazz fan I strongly recommend this CD. Most of the Pieces are mid-tempo to slower tempo, but always with a tango/samba/bossa nova rhythm you can sway to. Luis is a very tasteful guitarist and a sensitive, romantic vocalist that will have you looking out your window at the sunset, martini in hand, sighing with pleasure.The Cd is extremely well produced by Co-Producer TommyLiPuma. Mr.LiPuma is also the producer on Diana Krall's last few CD's. He doesn't disappoint on this one either. It gives equal pleaure.I hope you enjoy it as much as I have."
5,Almost a Master piece,"This is a perfect CD to play when you need to relax after a hard day working or when you are looking for that perfect music to play during a romantic dinner with your date.Luis is a very good guitar player. Smooth and warm melodies. In all the songs the guitar is the key element, sometimes with other sweet instruments that produce a deep latin flavor. Only two songs with Luis singing. Count on me is my favorite.I would say this is smooth Latin american jazz with a ""tango"" soul. Too bad Luis only have this CD. His other one about tango is quite different. If looking for the perfect gift to impress that wonderful lady or your dream knight, this is the CD."
4,Sharpening stones,"I think these are good sharpening stones. They are good for sharpening chisels and gouges. Not great, but good."
2,Typical scholastic mish mash.,A good book of this type should start with the simplest formula for the concept then add to it with more advanced formulas. This book instead just dumps a mid to high complexity formula on the reader and attempts to clear up the mess in the associated paragraphs. Thus it is more like an appendix for those that already know the material. A waste of time to learn from and a confused review. See the Elastic Modules formula where such a simple concept is shown with only one complex formula rather than with simple formula building to complex.
3,This and that...,"As a beginner book, T.W. Rollestone's ""Celtic (Myths and Legends)"" is both interesting and simple, offering many short versions of various myths, and a little information around the figures appearing in them. Sad to say it has a tendancy to seem like a collection of different essays -some which I like less than others. It is good for working as a quick encyclopedia (though, a limited such), but a bit hard to read all at once. Rollestone also decides to quote the Barddas, which makes at least that chapter bit more questionable."
1,Awful,"Oh, it's the old amnesia plot, yet again. And again this looks like a latter day refugee from some 1950s TV show, replete with young Ryan Phillipe tearing his hair and screaming when nothing makes sense because he can't remember. The dizzy camera work, and excessive gore don't make it any easier to watch. Except wait, the memory does start to come back, in bits and pieces, only things ain't so good!! The problem is this has been done way better before."
2,What is the purpose ?,"Where did this movie come from ? Was it a theatrical release? I stumbled upon this by accident. I thought it would be a stinker and I was right! Ryan P. has only played in two movies I have liked and that was ""Way of the Gun"" and ""Cruel intentions."" This movie tries too hard to be a weird psycological thriller. Which the only thing it does is dance around a cut close easy subject. The movie's payoff could have been explained in 30 min. Just like that movie Abandon. I hate movies like that, there aren't many David lynch's out there. Trust me, this isn't worth it after u watch this once in the garbage it goes. This isn't a deep thriller at all. The end is basically nothing surprising, nothing u couldn't write on ur own. The movie is loaded with flashbacks ! This and ""The Jacket"" are almost the same movie ! Only this throws a little violent twist in it . I am the king of psycological thrillers and this one is junk ! Probably why this is so far under the radiar !"
3,IS OK MOVIE!!,"I just bought this DVD because, I kind of like ryan phillipe , didn't see him in any movies for long while and loves hes act and looks :) .Movie was ok just very confusing and puzzle type movie.Jump from this to that,is like repeat the seens and same old paste over & over,And Really wasn't anything exciting about this movie or scrip to tell u to buy the DVD is that kinda movie u want to see it, then forget it fast, Maybe only a rental worth,Nothing more. C+"
5,Great Condition!!,"This is an amazing movie--The seller's price was great, the shipping was quick, and it was in great condition!"
5,Practical advice - not just for Yankee fans,"Torre distills his management style in a way that's both enlightening and engaging. The practical information is here: how to focus your energies on the big picture instead of letting little setbacks get you down, how to deal with a tough boss (and it applies to difficult colleagues as well), and the importance of communication. The stories of the Yankees' record breaking season are great, but the information here is so much more than just baseball anecdotes. This stuff really does apply at work as well as at home."
4,I love my Kiwi,"Had this stuffed kiwi since college... over 15 years. Still looks brand new even after going to classes with me and my moving multiple times. Now it sits on display in a closed cabinet. I never bought the Kiwi to collect it and if I ever have kids, they will get to play with it. Very cute toy."
2,sorry but it ain't all that,"I read the 2 reviews on amazon and since I did like her single, Me and Emily, I thought I would really enjoy the cd. Well I didn't. Bought it this morning, heard it once, put it on ebay. Not one I would care to listen to over and over. But everyone is different. I personally was hoping that her album reflected ""me and Emily"" which reminds me so much of the melody of Marc Cohn's ""walking in memphis."" I would recommend anyone who is interested in this album to listen to it first if possible and come up with your own conclusions. But let me state for the record, ""Me and Emily"" is not a reflection of the musical style of the whole album. That is the only song in that genre."
3,Good overview for beginners,"This DVD only covers one aspect of concealed carry - the mechanics of ""how"" to carry a firearm.Unfortunately, the instructor does not delve into the personal and legal aspects.For a beginner, there are some useful tips that could save you some money. Most people learn through trial and error. By demonstrating the various methods, it better prepares you to make a more informed decision about how to carry a firearm.There is too much focus on speed of presentation and reholstering. These are skills that are better taught in a class with a real instructor, instead of on a DVD that is clearly aimed at beginners.Overall it's a good product. The DVD is nothing more than a transfer of their VHS version. There are no special features. I have seen this video used in concealed handgun licensing classes, because it is a good overview of carry methods.If you are interested in pursuing a CHL license, this is a decent primer on ONE aspect."
4,Interesting for New CCW Holders,"This tape is a good start for new holders of a CCW (Carry Concealed Weapons permit).Seasoned CCW holders will get little from this video, newbies will learn enough to avoid making some of the mistakes that most of us had to learn the hard way.It has some interesting footage on various carry options, some good practical shooting advice and examples of shooting from concealment (ie: through a coat pocket).In my opinion, it makes too much of the ability to reholster the weapon after it has been drawn.It does not cover the ethical, legal and post-shooting mindset aspects that would have made this a well rounded video. It only covers methods of carry, clothing choices, the draw and shooting.NOTE: The ""Fastest Handgun Concealed Draw and Firing"" shown on this tape should NOT be attempted by ANYONE, EVER!Recommended!CFH"
3,Average CCW video,"I have had this for a while. It will tell you a thing or two about CCW that you may need, but it is meant for the beginner. I was fairly informed before I saw this so it was kind of meaningless. Also, you kind of have to buy into Lenny's mentality which I don't really. It is well executed and accurate. It would be a good primer for real CCW training and knowledge quest."
2,"Interesting, but not really useful.","This book is interesting because it covers topics from fitness, to self-defense, to rope and wall climbing.The self-defense recommendations are sometimes bizarre and dangerous however. An example of this is a punch where one bends forward 90 degrees at the waist and extends the arm straight out - making the body into a giant 90 degree angle. This particular move is biomechanically and tactically dangerous in real self-defense - and there are others like it.I don't care what a person's credentials are - there is a lot of stuff taught to armed forces all over the world.The book has some interest, it just isn't good for what it's intended."
3,"Tons of fun, but not durable","I bought this LeapPad for my son last year and my son has been playing with it for a year now. Today I bought him a new LeapPad book and only half way through the new book, the LeapPad stopped working. At first I thought it was the batteries, but soon I figured out the problem is at the wiring of the pen. It only works when I hold the pen at a certain angle. But how can you tell a 4-year-old to hold it still all the time! It basically is a piece of junk now sitting in my garage.My son has been playing with LeadPad products since he was 17 months old. The LittleTouch LeapPad worked great. The 2nd one (My First LeapPad) broke after one year. Now the 3rd LeapPad also broke after one year. LeapFrog really needs to improve the durability of their products."
4,Be ready to spend more,My 3yo daughter enjoyed it a lot but be reminded that you need more books to purchase from them from time to time. In other words be prepared to spend more to keep enjoying this item
3,"Fun, but burns through batteries","My son received this for his 4th birthday. He played with it for 1 week (about 1 hour per day) and the brand-new Duracell batteries burned out. I played with him, so I know it was turned off properly. The instructions state that alkaline batteries must be used--no rechargeable batteries. Who is going to replace 4 AA batteries on a weekly basis?!?"
1,Hard to understand,I used this book in graduate school for a statistics course. It was very hard to understand and I hope your professor uses a different book.
2,Suffers from Goldilocks syndrome,"This book has a bad habit of overly complicating relatively simple ideas (the entire chapter on estimation, for example), and under explaining some of the more difficult ideas (the section on the Gamma distribution is just horrendous). The examples in the book seem to be chosen and expressed starting with the assumption that the reader is already quite familiar with the subject. The exercises with solutions, (odds) are much too simple, while the rest are quite difficult, making self-learning very difficult. Highly frustrating."
3,A Weak Choice For Upper Division,"The text isn't ""bad,"" but I would look elsewhere. Sections and exercises are numbered in an uncomfortable way. Important topics and formulae are hidden within dense paragraphs, instead of being visually offset. The overall graphic and textual communication works... barely. There is much room for improvement."
1,"Many ,many errors to odd number problems","This book has good explanations of the topics covered in each section , but the solutions to the odd numbered problems are full of errors. I can't stand this book anymore , I need to check my solutions to reinforce my knowledge and the book doesn't provide correct solutions.I would recommend to everyone to stay away from this book."
2,For an expensive books its not worth it,"There just arent enough examples, your basically trying to solve the problems at the end on your own, bad book."

3,This book is more theoretical.,"This book simply does not have enough worked out examples. This book is more theoretical than applied. I personally favor applied books more. I purchased Probability for Risk Management by Hassett and it is a lot more ""hands on."" It explains what you need to know in a few paragraphs whereas Wackerly takes pages to say the same thing. Granted, if you're looking more for theory, go with Wackerly's Mathematical Statistics. If you're looking to pass an actuarial exam, Hassett is undoubtedly the way to go."
1,Worst stat book ever,"I work as an actuary, and I have passed the first actuarial exam (the calculus and stat exam with a <30% pass ratio). My friend uses this book for her stat class, and I have found it to be a terrible book.I hope that any teacher reads this, and looks at the book before assigning it to a class.There are very few examples of problems, very little discussion of theory, and it is structured in a way that does not allow you to easily reference other texts.If you want a good text for challenging problems and relevant examples, try Hogg and Tanis."
3,Non Fiction,"Mathematical Statistics with Applicationsby William Mendenhall and other authors is a higher level university text on probability and statistics, dealing with some of the underlying mathematics and calculus, moments, probability generation functions and all that sort of thing.Definitely not your light right type of mathematics books by any stretch of the imaginaiton."
2,Look elsewhere if you're looking for a rigorous text.,"If you like applications and problem sloving, pick it up--it's loaded with it. But if you're looking for a book with a strong theoretical foundation, look elsewhere. Quite often my professor would see it fit to do a ""more general case"" or a ""more rigorous proof."" I found the examples and motivations to be weak and not very helpful, and the proofs to be kind of a joke. I often felt like I was reading a freshman calculus book while reading this one, as it's been a while since I read a math text that hi-lited definitions and theorems..."
4,review,"hard cover, the textbook is always in good conditionuseful content, the most widely used textbook in statisticsprice is bit high though, it is still worthy buying"
1,Very misleading,"I was excited about ordering this book instead of having to purchase it at the bookstore. However, when it arrived I was so disappointed! I certainly did NOT get the book I ordered. I ordered a paperback, 7th edition/2008 copyright, but what I received was a hardback, 2nd edition/copyright in the 80's. Because of this I did not have my textbook until the second week of classes.On a lighter note, though, I sent the book back with no problems, and tried once more. My account was credited for the first book, and the correct one came the following week."
4,My goto stats book,"This has been my goto stats book since I bought it for a class in 2002. It's a clear introduction to mathematical statistics. I use it to try to understand some of the more advanced concepts that I'm learning now, but, unfortunately, it is just an introductory book. It does have a lot of information in it, so I still rely on it pretty heavily.On the flip side, I'm using this book less and less because I bought Wasserman's 'All of Statistics', which is much more compact and has far more concepts in it. 'All of Statistics' is more of a reference tool, instead of a learning tool, though.If you want to learn statistics, pick up this book and Ross's First Course in Probability. For most non-specialists these books will contain all the probability and statistics you will ever need.Sorry I can't recommend anything cheaper."
5,That book is excellent,"I'm a teacher of Catolic University of Guayaquil(Ecuador) P.O.Box 09-01-4671.I need Solutions Manual to Accompany Mathematical Statistics with Applications by William Mendenhall, Richard L. Scheaffer and Dennis D. Wackerly; to work in the most indicated way."
1,I did NOT receive the item!!!!!!!!!!!! The seller did NOT even ship it!!!!!,I did NOT receive the item!!!!!!!!!!!! The seller did NOT even ship it!!!!!Never buy things from this seller.
2,Not what I'd hoped for,"I give this cd collection kudos for gathering together a pretty good selection of movie music tracks. However, most the tracks are cheaply remade, the quality of which reminds me of the sort of music you can hear in a higher-quality early Playstation game (Final Fantasy 7 is what comes to my mind). All of the orchestrated (and choral, if I remember correctly) are done electronically. The solo parts are done well enough, though, and I have to say that ""Dueling Banjos"" from Deliverence is fun to listen to. Ultimately, it'd be better to buy the original soundtracks and make this into a playlist yourself even if you didn't necessarily have the funds for that. In other words: don't bother."
1,Missing CD's,"I received this cd with only one cd in the package, cd number 3. The package was supposed to be for three cd's. I should have returned the item but I keep the one cd even though it was the third favorite of the three I will never buy from this seller again."
3,The book was interesting but not spectacular,"I thought that the family infighting was okay. However like many novels, the main characters got together too quickly and lived happily ever after. I wish that the book was longer so that we could learn more how mean the family really is."
3,Ok read,"Ok its 9 years since this book has been published so maybe time has damaged my perceptions. This book is not a good read, its pretty average, the plot premise is strange. Successful, rich business woman wants to get revenge at a company, the owners and employee that insulted her 20 years ago. Considering that the adults who ran the company and the employee who insulted her are no longer in charge, I have to wonder how she was a success based on such way of thinking. Anyway man falls for woman, her arch enemy and all ends well, however the family in fighting is realistic - rich, spolit and snobbish folks. The third book in the series is much better."
3,Cutie,"While I love the creator of this DVD and truly believe she is an expert at her craft, this DVD was not worth the price and it truly is for the person who is not use to working out. Will I use it again? yes, in addition to another form of workout."
4,Good workout,The tape series is good for people who are just starting an excersize program or who are out of shape. The music is very good.
3,"Good, but have one complaint & it's a biggy","Truely what others here have said is correct. The charts, references, timelines, etc... in this book are wonderful. I can get alot of use out of this book. My big problem with this book, and the same goes for all Holman books in my library, is their incessant use of the word Palestine instead of Israel. It troubles me that the land of Israel, it's importance, it's prophetical re-establishment, etc... has been ignored by the publishers of this & all Holman books I have seen. It is as if they make a point to ignore that Israel is a nation, is a people ! Palestine is incorrect & unscholarly. Sure, it was called Palestine for a period of time when the Romans took over & gave it the name Palestine to assert their dominance, but before that it was called Israel and today it is Israel."
3,"Holman book of biblical charts, etc","I think this book is great, so much information contained in so little space! The pictures and charts were colorful and easily read. I would recommend it to anyone who is eager to explore their religious background in detail or someone with a bit of curiousity about just how things were back then."
3,A true romance. Rooting for Frederica all the way.,"Beautiful poor Frederica. She had been cast to the side in the shadow of her gorgeous blonde sister. What to do? A marriage of convience for Frederica? We'll see about that. With her spirit and liveliness she can prove that love conquers all. She is a model for all woman-kind (or man-kind). Her trials and tribulations make even a hard-core romance reader like me feel sympathy for her plight. This is a definite yes, in the ""books to be read department"". I would suggest that you read it alone and get comfy, it is a very enthralling novel."
1,bad bad BAD,"It isn't often that I feel compelled to write a review for a book I've read. It has to be either really very good or excruciatingly bad. Unfortunately this book falls into the latter category. I read about 80 pages before giving up in disgust. It isn't that the plot was all that awful, but the writing was so bad I couldn't read it. The Britishisms are stolen from Georgette Heyer, not to mention that the plot bears a striking resemblence to Heyer's ""FRiday's Child."" But the writing was so shallow and rushed, and each character felt like a caricature from romantic fiction. Frederica, impetuous, striking, tiny, spunky... gag. Her sister, Clarissa a beautiful goddess so vain and mean that she is unrealistic. Not to mention the stereotypical, title hunting, evil stepmother.... How do books like this even get published!? Anyway, I feel the urge to warn anyone who might want to buy this. Don't! It would be a horrible mistake"
4,Should have been the first recording.,"Another reviewer mentions being able to enjoy this right away rather than listen repeatedly to 'get' the Holdsworth stuff. I'm the guy who -likes- music that takes a few listenings to 'get'. After getting 'up to speed' , (to the extent that this is possible!), on 'Truth In Shredding', 'Centrifugal Funk' isn't as satisfying. When these guys hit full-speed, improvisational creativity is turned off & long stretches of memorized patterns are blasted through. Amazing yes, physically, but not musically, at least, not when compared to actually 'thinking on your feet' through fast tempos, odd meters, and challenging chord progressions. On electric guitar, Holdsworth is -the- modern master of true improvisation on rapid passages. Gambale was up to the challenge, & played his best to-date. I guess there was nowhere to go but down."
2,Uninteresting,"This album is mundane. After the first track, which sounds promising, it carries on with Frank Gambale and co. shredding on top of an over-produced, repetitive rhythm section. The drums have a loud, gated sound that seems over-compressed and not very live or interesting. The music seems to go nowhere and one hears a lot of unoriginal riffs and progressions in the mix that come back again and again.The whole recording has no soul. Someone tell me which is a good Gambale album because this one isn't."
3,Some say it is the best.,...and it may very well be the best but I couldn't finish it so I guess I'll never know. I find chess books extremely tedious and yet I can't stop buying them hoping one day I'll get better just by owning over a few dozen books I'll never read. Capablanca was awesome but none of his magic rubbed off on me after reading almost half this book.
5,Its Magic!,"The whole album is fantastic. Anyone who wants to test some new speakers should que up ""When Your Lover Has Gone"" & crank it! It doesnt get any better."
3,It's a good book,"I think It's a good book but I rated below four stars, because the text is almost the same as the previous editiom. The book has good personnel(kind of human resources) exercises."
3,public administration worrk book,Good book very helpful in understanding public administration and documents that one might encounter in the real world.
2,Unauthorized DVDs - Not Originals,"While watching these DVDs, there were a few places that didn't play exactly right. I just figured it was my player because I've had other DVDs act similarly in my player, but played fine in other players. But when I tried to sell this set back to Amazon for a gift card, the set was rejected because the DVDs are 'unauthorized'. Apparently, they are not originals. So - buyer beware!"
3,CSI N.Y.,"This should have been excellent, I certainly expected to sit down and enjoy my evenings with Mac Taylor and his team. I have been surprised to find that this series of CSI has even exceeded the other two - certainly left the original Las Vegas one lagging a long way behind - and I waited a long time for season six. What a horror!!!! I assume these DVD's are put out by CBS and I have to state that they need to pay real attention to what is being replicated for the paying public. I have had THREE copies of this season and all three have appalling sound problems - to the extent where it completely spoils my enjoyment. Please CBS DO something about this. I am waiting with trepidation for season 7 - will it be as bad? I hope not - I do not want my love affair with Mac to come to such an ignominious end!"
3,Received yesterday why ask so soon.,It is too early to know what I think of this series. I'm hoping I will like it and when the 7th come down I will probably try it. Retirement slows my purchasing down.
2,Still love the show - the DVDs are the problem,"I've been catching up on this show for the last few weeks and have noticed that the video pixellates every now and then. Quite often, actually. I did a little investigating and discovered the discs are DVD-5s instead of the standard DVD-9s. This means that they are about the same quality as DVD-Rs. They say on the pacakaging that they are dual layered discs, but clearly they are not. They are cramming the same amount of data as a normal DVD onto half as much space. A normal DVD (DVD-9) will contain about 7.5GB of information. These DVDs (DVD-5) contain about 4.5GB. Just like DVD-Rs. This means they are over compressed and a lot of data is lost. They are a rip off plain and simple. I don't know if all of these sets were produced this way or not, or if I was just one of the unlucky ones who got a bad set. I hope seasons seven and eight weren't released on similar discs."
2,Cracked case,"Case cracked up and completely useless. Crumbled into several pieces when i tried to open. not ""like new"" as advertised"
5,great book and series,"Big fan of Modesitt, i enjoy this series very much, changing the world, and world view, on the run. The bad guys lose big."
3,An unpleasant reading experience.,It was dull and boring...more like an old history book than something I'd read for pleasure.
2,Thick Glass..........,I ordered these glasses thinking that they might be as delicate as the ones shown in the pictures but they're really not. The picture is accurate in showing the shape of the glass but not the thickness. The glass is really THICK. I guess I should consider the price when judging this product but the 12 that I ordered are sitting in the box they came in in my basement.
4,"Hard, edgy, and ethireal","My friend had a copy. I asked to borow it. After listening to it, I was happy I asked him for it. The first half had an harder edge to it. I'm not a big fan of ""Hard core"" but this was a bit diff. There were alot of vocals on this disc, I was glad to hear. Over all I would say this is a good trance CD. If your a fan of trance give this one a try."
5,Good Reference,"I am presently on my third Shar Pei. The first, ( Bear) lived to 13 1/2 and had to be put down due to Cancer and failing eyesight. I lost the second one ( Andy ) on Feb. 23 of this year due to complications related to Shar Pei Fever. He would have been 8 one the 8th of June. I now have a new addition ( Cocomo) who was born on May 1st of this year. This was one of the first books I got on the subject and it is a good one. As you can probably tell, I am hooked on Shar Pei's as they make excellent companions. I never had any problems with house breaking the first two, although ""Mo"" has been a bit more of a problem, although not bad (just a couple of accidents when I wasn't paying attention to him, as he would let you know by going to the door). The breed is intelligent and the book is very helpful in helping with your understanding."
4,A good source of information,"I have previously owned a shar pei before, but when my husband and I started planning on getting a new puppy I thought I would find a good book on shar pei. I bought three books originally but came to find that I like this one the best. Its simple and not very big, but is filled with lots of information. Info ranges from caring for you puppy or adult dog, health concerns, nutrition, obedience training and information about the shar pei breed. I would reccommend this book to anyone who has or is getting a shar pei."
5,Author exposes global terrorism's economic engine,"With huge swaths of the world's economy taking place in the black market, money laundering has turned into an intractable problemw with wide-ranging consequences. British journalist Nick Kochan offers an intriguing study of this shadowy world. He argues that laundering was an overlooked problem in the U.S. before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks pushed the issue to the fore. Indeed, he says, Americans were oblivious to the effects of dirty money. Kochan details the sordid sagas of Russian gangsters, Colombian kingpins and corrupt Mexican bankers. At times, his broad approach hinders his prose, and his examples aren't always as compelling as they should be. Still, we recommend this eye-opening study to anyone who deals with the global movement of money."
3,Holder,It's the perfect carrying case for the slides for the view master but the zipper keeps sticking at times making it a struggle to close.
3,storage,The storage case is perfect to keep all the view master slides in one place and carry them around. Just what I was looking for.
3,Convenient,"I bought a stereo for my car and used this to install it . It was pretty easy to use, however I have a 2000 Hyundai Elantra and the color chart didn't quite match up. I got it all hooked up eventually, but my stereo disconnects sometimes and I have to mess with the wires."
5,I want more!,I can't find this product locally anymore. It fits my needs perfectly. I want more of these. The other containers now available don't work as well as this product. Please bring it back!
2,I purchased this book,"The author omitted several of the founding families of this very specific area that the book claims to cover, and those families were the reason I purchased the book."
5,Just right for us- modern but basic,"High tech digital sound and lights are wasted on me. This unit combines all of the music features I need into one compact attractive package that sounds as good as any boombox I've owned. I like the dial tuner better than a digital tuner. If you're into the absolute best sound and hi tech features, this is not for you. If you want something to play music in the living room, to play your nostalgic moldy oldy records, and share with the whole family then this might be just right."
2,Unfortunately Defective,"The unit appears very nice, however, I was dissapointed the first time I went to use it. The turntable of the phonograph was warped badly enough to scrape against a particular point in the rear. It appeared to be scrapping against the turntable assembly and was loud enough to make it impossible to ignore.Also, adjusting the volume knob created severe and continuous static from the speakers. Obtaining clear static free sound from both speakers simultaneously took several minutes. It did sound good once this was achieved!Note that TEAC no longer lists this model on their webite and I am assuming it is discontinued. Also TEAC's webpage has listed service/repair numbers for certified dealers in my area. Unfortunately these numbers are outdated. I am still in the process of getting a refund/replacement."
5,Rope Around The World,"I got this video for my 3 kids, aged 12, 9 and 5, and they've all watched it several times. They follow the video with a jump rope (recommend you get a jump rope for each kid or else they'll be fighting over it!). My 5 year old boy did the whole half hour workout and then wanted to do it again. I've never seen his cheeks so red! Great entertainment and exercise for kids of all ages."
1,I've seen better homemade videos,"The production quality of this video is appalling. It looks like some home video footage was later spliced into a brief, weak instructional set piece. Erin Moore can definitely jump rope, but she's a weak instructor, and the video goes nowhere."
5,"Don't tell anyone, but I love this book","If you long to reminisce about love, sadness and youthful struggles that have a happy ending this is a good book."
4,Good book for those interested in adopting from China,"While listed as fiction for young adults, I would caution parents from having their children read this unless they read it first. Jess, the main character, seemed more mature than most 14-year-olds, but perhaps maturity is achieved through the tragedy of her father's unexpected death. We are in the process of adopting from China and the descriptions in many of the scenes ring true with what friends and acquaintences who have already completed the journey have shared with us. I was moved to tears more than once; both tears of sadness at Jess's grief and tears of joy when the families are finally united with their daughters. Book also touches on many of the social and political reasons behind Chinese adoption. I would recommend especially for those who cannot get their families to read the non-fiction books such as ""Lost Daughters of China""."
3,The streets are never safe,"Love motorcylces? Then you'll love Wild 7. A force above the law that helps take out organized crime, corruption and media power brokers. One thing you can enjoy is the cool gadgets on the motorcycles such as boosters and missile launchers. The character design of the biker group is really well done and better than the others. Chase scenes are where Wild 7 does justice with gun toting bad guys firing down streets. The dubbing is pretty much ok. The animation is a place where this show needs some improving. Grated, Wild 7 may not be everyones cup of tea and it may need a little time to find its target audiance, but overall, an ok anime with a few glitches. Rent it first."
3,Not the real thing...,"Melina is one of the most awesome women to come out of the WWE since Sensational Sherri, Miss Elizabeth and Moolah. Unfortunately this figure is a bust. No way the svelte Melina has such tree trunk thighs and belly as this sculpt implies."
4,Kind of the Dead,"A nice toy. Since it was out of stock here, I bought mine from Wal-mart. There are a few problems with it, however. The leg joints are kind of flimsy and the cloak doesn't hang right. Minor design flaws that can be overlooked. On my particular figure, the sword doesn't fit in the scabbard. It appears to be blocked by a bit of plastic shaving. Easily fixed, and I don't think all of the figures are like this.On the up-side, the glow-in-the-dark feature is really nice and well done. He doesn't just glow a little, he's like a mini disaster flood becon. Also, with his left hand being open, the King of the Dead can preform a very nice two-handed sword pose. Definitely a plus. His cloak and under robe come off, so you can strip him down to his bare armor if you like. Not to mention that most of the moving part are made of a rubber material so that less breakage is possible.Overall a great toy. I would buy it..."
5,"Passionate, strong characters....the finale in the series","Personally, all I can say is I couldn't put it down. The 3rd in the Princess Brides series about the youngest sister Joelle and Leo. Strong Alpha male, whom I adored.Harlequin's Book Summary:Princess Joelle Ducasse must marry the man who has been chosen for her. Joelle knows her marriage will be one of duty, not love. So in an act of defiance she decides to spend one hot, steamy night with a gorgeous stranger. But unbeknownst to Joelle that stranger is actually Prince Leo Borgarde - her future husband!Leo is furious that his future wife could behave in such a reckless way. He demands that Joelle must be punished, and he knows just the right way...by marriage!"
4,:0),What a great way to end the series of the princess brides..Joelle just wanted to be her and i think she did in the end.. it was great read about the whole family and having them reunite in the book again...My favourite though is still the first one but i love them all...
2,Terrible H & H,"I'm a little over half way done with this book and I have to say the H & H are horrid characters. The hero is forever running of their heroine. He's not likable. I know it's typical harlequin, but I absolutely hate how all he has to do is touch her and she forgets why she's so mad at him (usually with good reason). The heroine is as bad, but I really couldn't care what happens to her at this point. There is no chemistry between the characters. I'm only finishing this because I've forced myself to get this far. If it weren't for the previous stories I'd have returned it by the time she goes back to Melio.Sad this book is such a let down after a wonderful book 1 & 2 in the series."
5,"A horrible, hilarious ride...","I feared this book but could not put it down. What a horribly strange trip. Tim Dorsey's Roadkill will rearrange your synapses while simultaneously juggling multiple levels of meaning with the impact of a shovel in the head. Behind this book hovers an impishly hilarious spirit. This ain't Paradise portrayal, but it is the best book I've read in years."
2,Early Dorsey,"This is an early Tim Dorsey book. Not anywhere close to his later standard. The two main characters (Serge and Coleman) are there, but almost unrecognizable from the later books: Coleman is still in an alcohol/chemical fog, but Serge is more murderous and far less likeable and enjoyable. Dorsey, in this book, does explain that ""Coleman"" is not his real name, but a nickname from an incident from childhood involving his drunken father. It explains a lot, in that respect. I'm almost finished with this book, and I'm glad for it. Ready to get on with Dorsey's later, greater stuff."
4,"Blending of Edna Buchanan, Dave Barry and Carl Hiaasen","This is a laugh out loud story in the tradition of Dave Barry and Carl Hiassen. Yet it is also part Elmore Lenoard and Edna Buchanan. What it is not though is boring. This is a book that almost must be read in one seating because the reading pace is so fast and furious that you are too afraid to miss anything. Buy this book and read it at your own risk, laughing may actually reduce the stress in your life."
5,hilarious,"Florida roadkill is my first ""Florida book"" if you don't count seeing the movie Big trouble (based on the book by Dave Barry), and I don't.The hero/villain, Serge, who appears in more of Dorsey's books, is probably the first villain ever that I have loved to love (instead of hate). I find myself agreeing with his reasoning and motives and his love of animals and all things Florida will endear him to many readers.Not for those who dislike gore/violence/profanity, but those things are not the center theme of the book. Visit Dorsey's website (www.timdorsey.com) and link to a guided ""Serge tour of Florida""."
5,Ready for the rollercoaster,"Just found out about Mr. Dorsey and I'm looking forward to reading every book he puts out. Any fan of Florida's many legendary writers should probably add Mr. Dorsey to their list. I believe this is the first of the Serge novels, and I can't say as I knew what all was going on as far as the plot was concerned, but like Fear And Loathing, I was simply along to enjoy the ride. The characters crash, burn, pillage and blunder their way through it all, leaving a wide path of destruction in their green water wake. 5 stars on attitude alone."
3,"FL Roadkill - sex, drugs and rock and roll -",Entertaining book - If you like the movie Pulp Fiction this book is a similar in content and movement. Grew up in FL and great read to revisit history and locations around the sunshine state along with plenty of violence and dark humor
3,Not Tim Dorsey's best work,"My first introduction to the strange and twisted world of Serge A Storms was inTriggerfish Twist. It was fantastic! After reading it I had high hopes for Tim Dorsey, who has a unique and twisted way of writing that is sometimes like being hit by a hurricane.I was extremely disappointed with Florida Roadkill - not that it's a bad book exactly, just disappointing. It is the first part in a two book series with Hammerhead Ranch Motel. The book's flow is a bit slow and very scattered - events do not appear in chronological order. There are several characters introduced and you have to trudge through most of the book before it is clear how they are connected. Although I have not given up all hope for Dorsey - I would say skip this book, but definitely check out Triggerfish Twist."
4,A Killer In Florida A.G Per.7,"This book is great because the plot is very suspenseful. Three crooks steal five million dollars and hide it in a strangers car. Most of the book is the adventures of the three crooks and the money. During the book, the crooks are addicted to drugs. That is the only bad part of the book. If you get past all the drugs, you will enjoy this book a lot. Then you will not be able to put the book down because it is so good. The setting is in multiple cities in Florida. The characters include two best friends from high school, three crooks, and a dentist. There are some other characters in this hilarious book, but they do not play major parts.I recommend this book to anyone over the age of 11, partly because of the drugs. If you are above the age of 11, go out and read this book today"
1,Not worth finishing,"I had high hopes when I started this book, but it quickly became tedious. Too many characters, too many disjointed scenes, not enough plot. After getting half way through the book, it just doesn't seem worth the time to finish it. Given the grammatical errors in the book, I was surprised to find out that the author was a reporter, and even more so to find that he had been an editor.Stick with Hiaassen. If you want good, zany writing in a different setting, try Christopher Moore (Practical Demon Keeping et al)."
1,horrible... just plain horrible,"I got this book because of the positive reviews. All I can say is WOW... I really can't believe that anyone found anything funny in this book. Just plain awful. I made it through about 1/3 of the book and couldn't even keep reading it on my commute. One dimensional characters... non-plot ... just a terrible, terrible read."
2,Over the top weird,"While a big fan of weird characters in weird situations, this book was completely over the top with the characters. They weren't weird and quirky, they were just plain bizarre and not remotely funny. With the wonderful backdrop of South Florida, several authors have managed to write entertaining stories with eccentricities galore, but this one drops the ball."
2,Reader's review of Florida Roadkill,Florida Roadkill starts out humorously but is hard to follow with too many interrelated subplots. Its ending is unbelievable and by mid-book I was bored enough to read the last chapter and put the book out for recycling to the nearest convalescent hospital. Is is violent and parts of it are too viscious to be plausible. Perhaps plausability is not necessary in this type of crime fiction.
2,hard to follow,"Too many characters, hard to follow. Very shallow no depth to the people. Is everybody in Florida that crazy? I don't think so!!"
1,"Florida ""OVER KILL"" is more like it","Too over the top, too many players to keep track of. Nice plot but Dorsey is killing himself trying to ""out do"" Hiaasen. The result is a really bad knock-off. Not funny, not witty, the characters are too extreme. My biggest complaint however, is the volume of characters that were introduced; the book was just too ""busy"" to be enjoyable."
3,Liberal cliches and PC covered within but in all a good read,"A very over the top violent comedy written from a liberal point of view, it can still be considered an entertaing read, especially if you bought it secondhand. Dorsey lets his political beliefs be known as he paints the typical white male conservative as being bigoted,racist,sexist,homophobic,xenophobic and not very bright. He also takes aim at conservative talk radio, insurance companies and gun shows in a way which requires the suspension of disbelief. If you're among the perpetually angry, he is certainly speaking to you. Beyond that, this is a good book as a crime thriller, excellent as Florida fiction and decent as a comedy. The pop culture references should be adequate, if not impressive to most. Some extraordinary events take place toward the end but are excusable when placed into context. The story is also continued in Dorsey's next book which I have ordered, secondhand."
3,A little Tedious,The narrative tends to unnecessary wordiness in parts which gives the impressions of unevenness in the presentation of the story. Not up to the author's better efforts.
2,unimpressive,This book was recommended as one in the style of Carl Hiaasen. Not so. Not compelling in any way at all. Don't bother.
4,incredible,very good book it would highly recommend this book and can't wait to read the rest of the series. i have already started the next book and can't put it down
2,disappointing,"I had read Triggerfish Twist and Cadillac Beach; both were hilarious and engaging. By comparison, Florida Roadkill was a pot boiler, just totally flat."
2,One complete project makes this book.,The author tries to explain various key concepts of SOAP through one project that spans the whole book. Apache SOAP is used as the software of choice to build the project. Both of which did not appeal to me because:a. Apache is shifting focus to Axis from Apache SOAP.b. Concepts are better explained through short examples than through a project that would sometimes make the users feel lost.
4,"Objective, Easy to read and to understand.","Objective, Easy to read and to understand, but some examples have errors, the Tomcat version is too old and do not cover the Java Web Services Developer Pack (Java WSDP)."
1,Not worth of time and money.,This was the first book I had bought for my endeavor into the world of SOAP. Having read first few chapters it became quite apparent that either the author didn't have good knowledge about the subject matter or did a mediocre job to write this book in a hurry so that he can cash in on this craze of new technology. The sample codes are hard to comprehend meaning one may not understand the code at the first glance. The subject matter depicted in a inconsistent and incoherent manner. The book lacks any kind of structure.
4,Great product!,"Would be 5 stars if it had Dong Quai in the blend. Still, it helps many peri-menopausal symptoms. Highly recommended."
3,Bought it for irregular periods,"I have been using estrotone since end of July when I got off birth control pills and started TTC. Since then, I have had one regular period that lasted 33 days. My cramps were very mild! I usually have pretty harsh cramps. This month, I haven't gotten my period yet so I am hoping for the same. Other than that, my bbt has drastically regulated itself (been charting for months only to find out it was all over the place). Also, I used to get extremelly hot while sleeping, and it seems my temperature while sleeping has gotten much better as I sleep better now."
1,Allergic Reaction,"I really hoped this would help, but I had an allergic reaction to the New Chapter Estrotone softgels. Three days using as directed caused my skin have a rash, mostly on my neck. The search is on again for something that can help."
5,no soy!,"This is a soy-less phytoestrogen, useful for those of us who Can't have Soy, and it's Very helpful for Hot Flashes and Mood Swings..."
3,Haven't seen a change yet,I've been taking this product for over a month now. It was recommended to me to get my homones in balance. I just stopped taking birth control about a year ago after seventeen years and my acne has gone mad! I can't tell if this is helping or not but I'm going to continue to take it and see if it makes a difference.
2,not much help,Unfortunately this product really didn't work for my wife. She still has numerous hot flashes at day and at night.
4,Seems that it works for breast growth,"I am trying different products to grow my breast. I am an asian, I am 23 this year.I started taking these pills 3 month ago and had noticed growth in my boobies in the first two month. Now I am getting busy and sometimes forget to take it regularly. My breast also stopped growing. I start from 32B and now is almost 32C. I did take other products before. and some of them helped.And I have not get any negative effects from these pills. I will continue to take it."
1,Bad side effects...,"When I first started taking this products I had really bad headaches that went away after about 2 weeks.When I took the recommended dosage, I had more hot flashes. I cut back to one pill a day and the hot flashes went away. the irritabliity and anxiety went away as well.I thought ok cool, I think this is going to work. Now, the cons:1) While taking these pills, I put on weight very quickly (mostly in my tummy and thighs)2) I started menustrating again after not having a period for 4 months3) Had severe swollen ankies (that were very painful). I stopped taking the Esterone and the swelling went away.I've heard bad things about the black cohosh, but because of the other great herbs in this products I decided to give it a try. I will not be taking this product again."
3,Extremely fragile,"If these glasses were not so fragile they'd get 5 stars. The unique design is nice looking as well as practical (no condensation on the outside and liquid stays cool longer). We used them only once when one of the set broke; all I did was carefully pick up two at the same time. When they came together, the rim on one of them broke."
4,great design,We love these pilsners. They keep our beloved beer cold while not sweating all over the place. Haven't broken one yet and even withstood one dishwashing. I tend to hand wash though. Am going to buy a different style for a rock glass too. Great price for great design!
4,Beautiful design with a purpose!,"I bought these as a gift for my aunt. They are beautiful in design and she loves them! The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because I haven't actually gotten to use them yet, or see them in action. Double-walled glasses seemed hard to find so I'm very happy to have found these. I love Amazon!"
2,Poor quality - leaves black streaks on paper,"I was trying to save money versus the brand name Lexmark toners, but I guess you ""get what you pay for"" on this one. It is only a couple days old and it is leaving thick black lines and streaks on every page. If you are using this for a business, don't do it."
5,One of the Best Musicians,"Out of all Christian music that is out there today, I believe that Rich Mullins is one of the best. Yes there are great bands out there like Jars Of Clay and Casting Crowns, but Rich Mullins is different for me. His music is intimate, his music is spirited. Though he has passed away, I feel that God continues to use this man's music in order to bring people to Him through Jesus Christ. Listening to such songs as Creed, Sometimes By Step, and We Are Not As Strong As We Think We Are, I am constantly amazed by how drawn I am to my God and my King of Kings. I hope that many people will come to listen to CDs like this and have their lives transformed just as much as this man has transformed my life in my spiritual growth."
2,A book with lots of disappointments.,"The author published two books almost at the same time, one is ""Electronic Communications Systems: Fundamentals through Advanced"", and the other one is this book. I did not realize that this book is a subset of the former one (from Chapter 12 to Chapter 20) until I bought one. So if you are interested in electronic communications, you don't have to buy this book. Go ahead to purchase the former one."
1,"Be careful what you buy!!! Item pictured, isn't the item sold.","Please note that the book pictured does not have the word ""Advanced"" in the title. I thought that I was simply getting a newer version of the book pictured (the 5th edition is pictured), but in fact, it's a different book by the same author. I've just written Amazon Customer Service, but I thought I'd warn anyone smart enough to check these reviews :-) So word to the wise: be careful of what you buy."
3,Stage Direction in A Project for the theatre,"I found that this book really demonstrated the different beats of action that can be found in the play. For example, when Nora decides to leave at the end of the play, you can feel her frustration as set out by the direction of the book. I recommend it for those who are looking to visualize how the characters appear on stage."
2,wobbles,"this stand is ""ok"" it wobbles a lot, the thing is askew, as in it doesnt have all 4 feet on the ground.for the bumper supports it says to use 3 washers but it only supplies 2 for each bolt not 3.the S pieces are more flat. causing them to slip off the bumper and chain. i have had the bumper fall once, luckly it was a test fit so i expected it to fall, i will be going to home depot to get some better S's for the chain.put zip ties threw the area where the chain clips onto. so the chain can be hooked in but not drop or get lost.it does what it should, but its not as stable as others i have worked with... quality could be better for the price."
4,Love's Old Country Music,"In reserching The Kendalls I found that there is only 3 songs on here from Heaven's Just A Sin Away, 6 songs from Old Fashioned Love, 3 songs from Just Like Real People, and 6 songs from Heart Of the Matter, plus 2 extra songs. That is only there first 4 albums of songs on this 20 GH. That also only gives you about 2-3 years of Hits. But if you want at least one song from there albums then you need to get 16 GH that has 3 song from Heaven's Just A Sin Away, 3 song from Old Fashioned Love, 3 songs from Just Like Real People, 5 songs from Heart Of The Matter, 2 songs from Lettin' You In On A Feelin', and 1 song from Movin' Train. That gives you songs from 6 albums. And gives you about 5-6 years of Hits. Plus if you want songs from Fire At First Sight you need to get The Best Of on the Curb Lable that has almost the full album on it with 6 songs from that album."
4,Great Phones if Size is Important,"We've always heard that size is important and in headphones size and weight is sometimes really important. These phones are extremely light and are good choices when traveling or for noisy environments. Excellent sensitivity, decent bass but a little light in the high end would be my overall impression. If you can go for a little larger headphone to get a considerably larger sound, go with the Koss Sportapro, KSC50 or KSC55. If you purchase these, checkout www.headwize.com for some good articles on improving the sound coming from these units."
3,ehhh..,"put these on. tried all sizes. kind of hard to get them in without having them fall out later. furthermore, the pressure from these plugs cause tension on my forehead area and gives me a headache.i'm going to try using different kinds of earplugs but while using these koss headphones. perhaps the old school squishy earplugs and cut a hole and stick the koss in it. or maybe the swimming or gun shot earplugs as described in another post.good deal for just the koss headphones. you might want to modify them yourself like all these other people."
5,Excellent little audio device.,"Unlike many of the other reviewers, I have not had any major problems with my purchase. I am actually on my third pair since mine keep disappearing from my house (unknown culprit). I really enjoy the way the foam conforms to the ears for a nice ""customized"" fit. I did not experience the ""tinny"" sound that some reviewers did, but I would have to agree that it would be due to placement in the ear and not the actual device itself. The only complaint that I do have is that when I am exercising or running and I am wearing these is that when I get hot and sweaty, they have a tendency to slip out of my ears. Other than that, I am more than pleased with my purchases."
1,Don't waste your Time and Money,"I never take time to review products but this one deserves my time. It looks like the reviews in this page refer to a different product and not to the one I received from Digital Media Source. I ordered this product thinking on all the good reviews and thinking this was the ""new version"" of the product but instead it looks like I received the ""very old"" version. The package it came on was old. It didn't include foams in different sizes, just one replacement in the same size than the ones it had on. The only pro is that you can use this product as foam ear plugs to block outside noise... but you can also get a pair for less than $1 in your closest pharmacy. Also, the bass is so booming that it gave me a big headache within a few minutes (so buy a few aspirins too!). Very bad response in the high frequency (treble). I am going back to my old headphones."
2,"Well, they do block out sound, at least.","I thought these would be a good travel idea, to block out external noise. That they do, in a small, cheap package. For that, they get a 2 instead of a 1.The bass that is trumpeted by the marketing is certainly there as well. But it simply sounded ""thuddy and muddy"" - we're talking quantity over quality in the bass department. In fact, these are probably the worst sounding headphones I've ever used. In the end, I preferred putting up with outside noise in my other phones (a nothing-fancy Sony pair) than listening to these.I also found them quite uncomfortable to wear for extended periods, but that can be a highly personal thing.All in all, the best part of these was taking them out."
4,Get your own earplugs,"I recently purchased these to have a pair the would make listening on the bus bearable. They failed at one critical point...I was unable to get them in my ears! Despite the range of cushions that came with it, I couldn't get any of them to fit. But after a quick trip to Walgreens (to get nicer earplugs) and a little work with a soldering iron, they live up to their initial purpose. While the sound quality doesn't blow me away, for the price they offer excellent isolation. They block out sound as well as the earplugs would have. One problem is they are extremely bass heavy. While at times that doesn't matter, when I'm listening to classical the balance isn't too good. In summary, you might have to shell out a few more bucks for better earplugs, but after they offer the most isolation of any earbud under 50$."
2,For Bass-heads ONLY,"""The Plug"" offers VERY poor balance across the sound spectrum, they are very bass heavy/boomy, resulting in a very muddy sound. Unless you listen to your music with the bass turned ALL the way up, I suggest looking elsewhere. Also, the acoustic tube is far too rigid and can scratch/gouge your ear canal. Overall, a poor choice."
5,Great Value and Great Sound,"I have purchased about 10 sets of these over the past few years. I keep them everywhere - car, PC bag, desk, gym bag. They last forever, they fit snugly, they are great on the plane because they block the noise - and the price is terrific. Unlike other ""sit in the ear"" products, these stay. I ever wear them while riding the lawnmower, with big ear protector headphones over them, and it makes the work go faster and not seem like work."
2,useless warranty,Warranted for lifetime but 9 dollars return EACH (even if shipped multiples) for shipping plus whatever you pay to ship to them to repair facility. They can be shipped for 3 dollars or less (no matter how many) very easily so Koss is definitely cheating us here. Used to be 6 dollars and even then they charged individually for these tiny items but you could gain a little over this 12 dollar for new price.Ear buds themselves are fairly good (usually last me about 2 months) when compared to how long most others last at this price and sound is also pretty good. They fit well and stay in good too.
2,Does not work under a helmet. Returning it :(,"I bought these earbuds specifically to wear while riding a motorcycle. This application requires good sound isolation to protect against dangerous levels of wind noise and a close fit without protrusions poking into the helmet liner. The Plug received good reviews on a few MC forums so I had to try it.The noise isolation is OK, about as good as theKlipsch Image S2 Comfort-Fit Noise-Isolating Earphoneswith silicone mushroom-type seals. The photo of these Kosses is deceptive though, and the plastic part that stays outside your ear is much too big. Not only does it snag on my snug-fitting Shoei each time I remove it, the sharp edges of the silver-colored ring also dig into my earlobes. (The Klipsch are similarly too long, but at least they have no sharp edges.) For any other application these are probably a good value for money.tl;dr if your helmet fits correctly, these won't. I'm returning them."
1,redefines pathetic,"After all the grand reviews, I had really high hopes and expectations for these. Unfortunately, they have all the depth of a 1970 transistor radio. I may have received the lemon pair but who wants to buy them again hoping for a better sounding ear bud? Don't waste your time is my advice. Find a genuinely well made ear bud."
4,Great Sound,"After trying several other ear-bud type headphones these truly have the best quality sound. I agree they are a little hard to insert, but once you get the hang of it, they're the best!! I definately reccomend them."
1,Unusable,"These work for some people's ears and not for others. One reviewer claimed that I must be either retarded or deformed since they don't work for me. That reviewer is best described by words not allowed in this venue.I'm going to replace the useless foam, others have suggested:for hunters: Silencio Super Sound Baffler earplugsfrom a pharmacy: Flents ""Quiet Please""I believe you have to create the center hole in these products to retrofit them to the Koss' ""stem"".- Jeff"
1,Don't plug the plug,"I just received the plug and gave it a try on my Nano. I bought the Plug in order to replace the Ipod set which bugs me while running on the treadmill at my local gym. Needless to say I have given up my efforts to get some decent sound out of them. I shoved them as far as I could up my ear canal, up to the point of pain. Sound was mediocre at best compared to the ""Stock"" earphones that came with the Ipod. It is of great mystery to me why some of the reviewers gave them such high ratings. Standard Ipod sets are way better.On the other hand I did not expect anything great due to the price. You mostly get what you pay for! Now I'm waiting for my Etymotic ER-6i Isolator head set which should (hopefully) be of better comfort and sound quality.My advice is to spend a few more dollars in order to get a good set."
4,"Grat comfort, great value... but not very durable","I've tried a lot of ear-bud style headphones and have found these to be the most comfortable. A great value. Sound quality is good, and the design of the ""plugs"" helps filter out noise. I found these to be great on an airplane, allowing me to relax to my music, while filtering out engine noise, conversations, etc... Highly recommended...UPDATE: I still agree with everything I wrote in my original review, but I've gone through few of these now. After 4-6 months, one of the ear buds goes dead or becomes intermittent. The wire seems to be worn or fatigued over time due to use, It's a cheap item, so maybe the price is still worth it... but just know that it may not be a very durable pair of earbuds..."
4,"Koss ""The Plug"" Portable Headphones","Very pleased!I love the spongy ear-cushions, they fit perfectly. I have had no problems with them popping out during physical activity. I am obsessive about keeping the cushions clean.I think the sound is great for my use.I have read that some users wished the cord were longer but I like the shorter length, less opportunity for catching it on something.It is an excellent product for the price."
4,GOOD FOR PRICE! BAD FOR MOVEMENT!,"For the price they were, these headphones are very good. They fit well and eliminate the outside noise well enough when traveling in the car with my family. The only complaint is that they easily fall out when working outside or when excersising. I bought them because I thought that the form fitting tight snug would stay in my ear, but I was wrong. They fall out when sweaty because their made of the plasticy waxy materials. Other than that, they are great headphones."
5,Great for the larger eared,"I love these things...love 'em! As do my larger friends. The petite crowd seems to have fit problems...but if you're 6 feet or over, or are bless with cavernous ear holes, don't hesitate!And so cheap! Hooray for Koss!"
5,the best headphone ever,"Koss The Plug totally rocks. I have Philips SHS3200 Earhook, Sennheiser MX400 and Sony Fontopia. When I compares all of them at the same time, Koss comes out the best, actually way better then all the other. Highly recommended."
2,nice but id rather something better,"They worked great for about a week. Now they anger me. I want my old earbuds that hurt my ears after a few hours that need to be wrapped over my ear to stay on. It takes so much effort to sit there and attempt to scrunch the foam then you need to stick it directly in your ear in under a second (can't miss) otherwise the foam will already be expanded and push back out of your ears. I'm sorry I don't have pin point accuracy sticking objects into my ears. Let me go get a mirror.Then once you finally succed in actually getting them in, you end up fumbling over the small cord and pulling them straight out leaving you with having to scrunch them all over again and take another 15 minutes getting pissed on trying to get them in. I would take them back if I was allowd to!!Yea they have great sound but the foam just stinks. It's to much troubly trying to get them in my ears. However if you have huge ears, these could be for you!"
3,Might work for some motorcycle helmets... but not for mine.,"I bought these after hearing they worked for people whose helmets didn't have speaker pockets.I'm glad it worked for them, but ""The Plug"" sticks too far out of my ear - they get hung up when putting my helmet on, and pull out painfully when taking my helmet off. But, then again, we're talking about a XXXL helmet (yes, 3 X's) so your mileage may vary."
3,Extremely Decent,"The sound quality is pretty average, but the headphones are really great when it comes to sound-cancellation. You have to prefer the in-ear style of headphones, or these will bug you to death. All in all, a good deal for the money. I was looking for something to replace my iPod headphones, and a friend recommended these. I'm pretty happy with them."
2,Don't expect much from it,"Works fine as a basic set of earphones. However, the one-size-fits-all foam earplug doesn't quite fit right and pops out quite easily. Instead, move on and look for a set with rubber ""caps"" that they often ship with 2-3 different sizes - these fit better, stay put without fatiguing the ear."
2,"Nice sound, but serious fallout","These headphones are have great sound for the price, but are only good for casual wear. If you plan on doing any kind of exercise, don't waste your money. The foam plugs didn't come close expanding in my ears and continually loosened and fell out at the least amount of jarring. Go for Sennhauser or Sony headphones if you run. It's worth the extra $20 and will save you a ton of time and frustration."
2,not that great...,"I've owned 2 pairs of these, and they do provide o.k. sound quality for the price. However, I've since switched to another brand of in-ear headphones (JVC Marshmallow--love 'em) due to several shortcomings of this product:- difficulty in acheiving optimum sound: you gotta have these positioned in your ear perfectly to get well-balanced sound- cheap cord: it's too thin and flimsy, tangles too easily- cranial reverb: every bite you take or word you say ressonates through your skull in an unsettling way when you have these on- sound quality isn't really that great compared to the JVCsThere are better value choices out there; I'd recommend skipping these."
4,"The sound is almost perfect, but the problems is the wire","Very good phone, but the wire is very weak. I had other The Plug before and was better than this one, most strong. But thats ok, the The Plug is very good."
1,awfull,these are some of the worse headphones i have tested the sound is horrible and tiny using an ipod touch no bass what so ever. i guess i have not learnt my lesson sony seems to have the best sounding headsets for this price range.
2,"Tinny, underwhelmed, get Philips HE592 instead",As a long time Philips HE592 user I was looking for something better or at least as good. In a head-to-head comparision the results are clear. The Koss require more power on the signal to create the sound (1.5-2x more). The bass is jittery and the overall sound quality poor. There is not nearly as much bass as the HE592. Compared to the HE592 it sounds like you are listening to the playback through a metal can.
2,Not that good,"The ear buds arent as comfortable as most others on the market and the sony fontopias sound much better, are more comfortable, and only cost a little more. These earbuds also didnt stay in my ear despite their manual on how to customize the fit."
1,"Good for plugging up bronchioles, perhaps","Having stared balefully in the general direction of these earphones for a little over two years now, I am better able to determine their true functionality.Whilst the manufacturer has it that they could be used as an ear phone, I believe they are much more suited as a chocking hazard for three year olds, or perhaps, as knotted recursive afunctional loops.To be fair, during the brief periods in which the earpiece actually stayed in the ear, I could grant that the sound was acceptable for the $43 (AU) price tag. Sadly, however, these moments were few. Far more often, said earpieces would blithely fall upon the user's shoulder, usually at a particularly climatic moment during a song.Oh, sure, you get spare pieces of foam. Spare pieces which also fail to fit into one's ear.Hopefully, as an earlier reviewer noted, Koss has since improved the product, because the only other viable use is probably in plugging bronchioles."
1,No treble,"The sound quality is total crap. You only get bass, no midrange, no treble. It's like putting subwoofers in your ears.If you care about things in music, such as ""melody"", don't buy these."
1,Garbage,"I would have felt better if $20 would have blown away in the wind. At least someone would find it and it would have made their day.The fit? Horrible. They come with 4 differant sized plugs. The material reforms to shape too fast and does not allow for time to properly position. Once in, they want to work their way out.The sound. Like listening to music underwater. Mucky bass and no highs.I am very dissapointed with them and have thrown them away so I do not have to look at them to be reminded how I wasted good money. Time for me to step up and buy some decent phones. You get what you pay for."
3,Not as good as KOSS Sparkplug,The headphones look better than older Koss Sparkplug but the sound quality is much worse.
3,"Like the Koss ""Spark Plug"" better","These are OK earbuds as far as sound quality but not better than ones that came with my Zen-M. They are more durable than orgionals and stay in the ear better but they seem to take more volume to hear well and I find the sound quality on the Koss ""Spark Plugs"" much better."
3,"Good bass, bad design","I bought these earphones to replace the crappy iPod earbuds. I needed something cheap, but with fantastic bass. I wasn't disappointed in the bass quality, however pretty much everything else about them sucked. The foam that goes into your ear gets gross after a couple of weeks of rubbing it between your fingers and inserting it into your ear (I can clean my ears; the question is how do you clean that foam?), but the worst part is that the little rod holding the foam onto the earphone itself snapped and rendered the pair unusable. All in all, these are not much of a gamble if you just need something to use until you can save up for some expensive earphones and need to replace your Apple iPod earbuds immediately."
5,Great for the price,"I use these mainly for riding the train in NYC and they work very well. All sounds in my favorite songs are clearly heard, you know how you know every instrument in your favorite song. Just make sure you squeeze them down and hold them in your ears until they expand. This is very important for getting the sound exactly right. For $10 they are a great bargain."
1,Poor Quality,I bought a pair of Koss plugs two years ago that I like a lot and wanted to get a second pair for work. I thought this pair was the same. Unfortunately I was wrong. The quality on these headphones are poor compared to my original pair. The sound quality is bad and the ear buds are samller and are not as comfortable in mye ears. I really enjoy the pair I had bought two years ago and am disapointed Koss has decided to redcue their quality in these head phones.
1,Don't waste your money!,"These are the WORST sounding phones I've ever purchased. I've owned many Koss phones over the years, from full-size headphones to ear buds, and expected Koss quality in these, but was sorely disappointed. They are tinny, fuzzy, with no bass and very little midrange. Nice idea, with the soft cushions, but if the sound isn't there, what's the point? I have a $7 pair of Radio Shack phones that sound 100 times better than these.Giving them to the kid to use on his hand-held video game, because they are useless to me."
2,This is my second pair and the left ear plug goes out. Beware!,I have bought these before and had the left ear plug go out after 5 months. Koss has a lifetime replacement guarantee so i returned them and after 7 months with my new ones the same thing happened. For the price its not bad but be warned you get what you pay for.
4,Good Headphones,"I like these headphones because they fit and stay in my ears a lot better than the ipod factory headphones. I don't claim to be a sound expert, but these headphones sound great to my untrained ear. I would definately recomend the headphones to anyone who likes to be active while listening to music, such as exercising, or doing chores around the house."
4,good product has some downs,These headphones are pretty good. They take some work to get in but when you get them in they work like a champ. I think they are great. But the only bad thing was that they were hard to get in.
2,Not good for tiny ears!,"I purchased these headphones thinking they might be a good fit for me since they seemed to be good for small ears.However, I have very small ear holes I guess, because these don't even go in. The only way I can use them is to take off the foam and use just the plasic rods in my ears. Wicked uncomfortable..So if you have average sized ear holes I'm sure these would be great, but if you have little ears, look for something else! (I'd love to recommend something, but I can't find any either.)"
3,"Good sound, low durability","I like the sound and form, but have gone through three of these by now, each lasted only a few months before it stopped working (wire or connection degraded, I assume). I will now look for something else..."
1,Try them on first,"I bought these headphones thinking they would be perfect for running. However, I CANNOT get them in my ears no matter which shape rubber plug I use. At this point it is just funny. I stand there trying to squeeze the little rubbery thing while stretching my ear out as pictured in the little diagram to no avail. My advice: TRY THESE ON BEFORE BUYING. While it's a great idea, it might not be such a great idea for you."
2,Product change,"I've been using Koss ""The Plug"" headphones for 4 years now and have been through a couple of pairs, but after buying this newest one I am disappointed. It does'nt sound the same as the pairs i had before and the higher pitched sounds hurt my ears, I've tried lowering the treble but that does not help.Before I had always given excellent reviews for the plug but now i cant.I would say look elsewhere if you are used to the Koss Plugs manufactured in years past."
4,The Pluys,"Great headphones for the money. Takes some getting use to with putting them in your ears. After stuffing them in for 2 weeks and having them constantly fall out, I finally got the hang of it. Roll and squish them in your fingers then twist them in, don't force them or it wont sit properly. I've had them for about a year and on my 2nd set (cord broke) after looking at ""The Plug"" mod site I tried adding a drop of epoxy on the vents on the backside to tame the boomy bass. Damn, what a difference! There is now more definition on bass edges as well as more kick. It seems as if it softened the lower midbass hump and extended the extreme lower end(6db roll off due the close box factor??? Who knows.) The mids seem more prominent also but that just might be in my head. But if you feel like modding them try 1st placing your fingers over the vents as you listen then remove them while still applying the same pressure to the Plugs into your ears. Good luck."
1,"For the active user, DON'T BUY","If you are an active user who doesn't dedicate their entire lives to making sure you take good care of your headphones, don't buy these headphones.* The major problem with these headphones is that underneath the removable squishy inserts is a delicate tube that is easily breakable even if the squishy inserts are on the tube. I broke this tube within the first few days of use and had no more use for them.* If you plan on keeping a close watch on these headphones and don't share them with others (therefore not spreading your earwax residue that builds up on the squishy inserts), than by all means buy them."
3,Sound is good - actual plug foam is bad,"they claim you can mash the foam, then place in ear; not unless you are extremely quick--the foam puffs back up too fast. Go out and buy over-the-counter foam earplugs and cut a hole in the middle. Works great on airplanes."
2,Throw away 'expensive' headphones,"Bought these earbuds in early June, broken by late September. Used 3 or 4 times a week while sitting on a bus, for about an hour a day. Now, only the left side plays. The 'lifetime warranty' from Koss requires that you send them back with a check for $9.00. Pretty sad when the headphones cost about $12 shipped.The reason for the 2-Stars is that they sound quite good when they work. But, since they only last about three months, paying $48/year is expensive, and a bit too rich for me.Got some Skullcandy phones to try. They sound almost as good as these, and I hope they last more than 3 months."
2,Cheap earbuds and poor sound,"This pair is good for the price ($12), but major problems include: inconvenience of putting in the earbuds (you have to squeeze the ends of the earbuds and wait for it to expand in your ears), the sound quality is pretty poor, not precise enough (about 3% distortion), and the bass adds extra noise to the sound. Overall, if you are looking for a cheap earphone but don't care about the sound quality, this is the pair to get. Otherwise, don't."
2,No actual warranty,I bought these earbuds three months ago and use them for about an hour daily. I now only get sound through one of them. The wire is broken just as it leaves the plug.This is the usual place just about every earbud I've owned breaks. The difference between these and any other set I've used is that these broke within three months. The others lasted eight months to a year and a half.The lifetime warrantee is unreal. If you send the earbuds to the company along with a check for nine dollars they will replace the $12 earbuds. You're probably better off buying a different pair at retail that would last longer than these.
4,Great for the price,"Pros:Great priceExcellent noise cancellationBetter comfort than any other earbuds I've triedCons:A little too heavy in the bass departmentOverall sound quality could be improvedIf you want great noise cancellation, but don't want to flesh out hundreds of dollars for music producers' headphones, just get these babies. They are essentially earplugs that you can plug into your iPod, and they're only 10 bucks, (plus shipping and handling) so forgive them if their audio quality isn't perfect. I work in a machine shop, surrounded by loud drills and buffers, and these earbuds quiet everything down to a distant echo. My friend used them in prison to cancel out all the hooping and hollering when trying to watch a movie/sports game.Get them if you spend a lot of time in loud places."
1,Very uncomfortable,"Well the poor design on these headphones provide a very uncomfortable fit. I'm 17, have average if not large ears but maybe my ear canal is smaller than average, my friends too? Because neither of us could get it comfortable in our easily. I tried for 20 minutes until my ear was raw trying to roll the big foam up and place it in my ear, and each time the foam uncompressed it would slide out of my ear. I managed once to successfully place it in my ear, but soon realized that more than 10 seconds to put a headphone in is ridiculous. Please do not go this route if you are searching for budget noise-cancelling headphones, i did and regret it."
3,"Useful, but delicate","I enjoy these headphones because I can listen to my iPod and work around the shop without worrying about additional hearing protection. However, they only last me for 3-6 months before they break. Apparently if you pull the plug out of the iPod (which doesn't seem like an unreasonable thing to do) eventually one side or the other will go out. I have purchased three total sets of this headphone and each of them have ended up with the same issue. I can't find any mention of a guarantee / warranty on the package either..."
3,Love to hate these earphones,"These are one of my favorite earphones to use but I've bought at least 4 of these within the last year and while they work, they are excellent. My problem is that they always mess up right near the plug. They get bent so much that they finally separate the wires some how and one ear will cut out. Every single pair I have ever bought has done this. I love them but I'm getting tired of buying them. I wish they would just beef up the wires a little to make them more durable."
2,Sounded good while it lasted,"They sounded good while they lasted. Unfortunately, they lasted under six (6) weeks. Costs $6 (plus your shipping cost) to get warranty replacement. That's more than half what I paid for them.Pro: good soundCons: wire for left side broke at plug, tended to fall out of my ears, Koss warranty costs"
3,Wiring failures -- a weakness,"I've owned three pairs of these. Each failed within a year due to a fault in the wiring. But this insert style is the only one that works for me (standard buds don't stay in my ears) and the cost is reasonable so I've just purchased my third pair. They also block out most background noise.The ones I just received from Amazon are not as pictured -- the plug style is different. The ones I received have a plug that sticks straight out rather than making a 90 degree bend. My most recent pair was also the straight-out type and the wiring failed within the flexible plug.I liked the sound quality of my first pair. The two most recent (including the ones that just arrived) seem to emphasize the higher frequencies, less bass. It's a shock to switch from regular speakers or headphones to these. I use them mainly for audio books rather than music so they're OK for me. Others might not be satisfied with the sound quality."
2,terrible cable quality,"These are good while they last (which is not very long) around 2-3 months. I've had about 4 of these because I don't want to be carring them around, but alwways wanted to have them handy. The cable quality is extremely bad in all the ones I've owned. They have not been abused since I don't cary them around and if I compare them to the the ones I use with my nokia cell phone which are really abused you can tell the difference, the cable for these feels really thin."
1,Terrible from end to end,"If been through a bunch of headphones, as I seem to be rough on them as I work out. The sound is like listening through toilet paper tubes. they have to be set in your ear just right in order to work, and after using them three times the connection from the cord to the jack broke. Dont waste your time on these"
1,Good head[hones but...,I had a older version of this headphone that had the angle plug on it.And they lasted for 3 years. These new ones have a straight plug and lasted only 2 weeks before i had to replace them. If they go back to the angle plug i will buy these again. If you look at the photo you see the angle plug they changed it to a straight plug.
2,Poor Fit,"I've had the blue and yellow version of these things for several years and was annoyed with them the entire time. Because I didn't use them very often, however (maybe because they were so annoying ... chicken and egg), I put off searching for a replacement.My chief complaint is that they were really uncomfortable for me. The foam did not provide a secure fit, and I always felt like they were on the verge of falling out (which they often did). If they did manage to stay, in they made my ears sore and the sound volume was very poor (probably due to the bad fit).There are definitely better products out there in the under $20 range (like the Panasonic HJE300's I ultimately bought to replace the PLUGs). I suggest shopping around."
1,Awful!,"I always thought that Koss was a quality product. Certainly better than the standard ear buds that came with my IPOD. Instead, the quality was tinny, no base, and much worse than those included with the IPOD. Very dissapointing indeed..."
3,Good news/bad news,"These work great; however, the pair I bought as a gift stopped working on one side after the first day. I've bought 2 other pairs that are still working and I love them. Guess I got a bad ""Plug""."
1,Very tinny with no bass!,I used to be a fan of the Koss PLUG. I had two pair which I wore everywhere. They delivered great bass with a full range of sound. Isolation was good. But a cord of one got caught in my door and destroyed one earbud. So I decided I would purchase another pair. Well the new pair does not have the same bass response at all. It also does not have the hocked earjack but a staight connector. This new one is not convenient since it is easily kinked. But the sound change was dramatic. This was a real disappointment. I really loved their old design.
4,"Cheap, usable earbuds","Definitely not high-quality, but good enough for the average person. At such a low price I have an extra pair on hand in case my kids break one of theirs, so we have a total of 4 sets in the house. If you want audiophile quality, you'll need to pay a lot more, but at less than $20, these deliver decent sound and I don't get sick every time I step on one or break a wire. For sound I'd rate them 4 stars, for durability I'd give them 2 stars, and price is a 5."
4,They work well for me,Product was highly rated by other buyers - I like them - the sound is very good...earplug type inserts are a little odd but I can definitely block other noises...
4,The Best earplugs,"The Plugs, are in my opinoin are the best headphones on the market. I've used many others like Sony but , they lack comfort and great sound which you get from The Plugs. Great bass sound and the cushion comform to your ear for that customized fit that drowns out the outside noise and gives you a crystal clear sound. The cord is nice and long. The Plug is the ultimate headphone, I just love 'em!!"
1,one side failed after about 3 months,"Good sound isolation, too much bass for realistic sound, might be ok if you only listen to disco...very uncomfortable after about 30 minutes."
1,uncomfortable,these plugs easily fall out regardless of what one of the three foam pieces you use. They are uncomfortable and hard to insert even if you follow the directions and suggestions here. I recommend the sony in earphones about $25
3,skimped on the cord ..,Amazon does it again with 8 foot spec but I only got 4 foot of it . I specifcly bought them for the bass and the long cord so am quite disappointed .The cord is shorter tehn the cheap earbuds that come with every 25$ mp3 .If I've had a back bone i'd argue with CS for a refund .
1,Waste of Money,"I was looking for a an affordable, fairly good, headphone that would also provide some outside sound isolation. I thought this would be the one. Wrong. Here is why:1. The foam ""plugs"" are not like the ones used by students to study or by construction workers. The foam plugs are of the worst possible quality. Therefore, they are nearly impossible to fit into your ears, and they do not stay in place if you get them into the ears.2. Even if you somehow manage to place them in your ears, they provide very little sound isolation.3. Even if you somehow manage to place them in your ears, they are very uncomfortable.4. Sound quality is as poor.The headphone is essentially a cheap one with a small tube like appendix that is inserted into a hole inside a cheap foam."
1,Avoid,"These will make your ipod sound like a cheap AM radio. I've been using an early version of Koss' earplug design which I bought around eight years ago, which sound very good. But these headphones are something entirely different. They have no treble and very little bass. Unless you're halfway deaf already, I strongly recommend against these."
4,Eliminates ambient noise,These earphones eliminate a lot of outside noise. You don't need to turn the volume on as much. Sound quality is not hi-fi.
3,"Nice, Basic, and Simply Addictive!","I have always been a fan of Koss ever since I purchased these headphones. The only problem I have is that after about 3 months of use one of the ear phone die-out. Then I go back and buy the same ol' headphones only to see how long they can last this time around. In all, I had brought these same headphones 5X's. Since I buy them on base I get them for $12.95x5 = $64.75. Now that I think about it the next 3 months down the road if these headphones aren't still working I'm moving my money limits up to by the V-Moda. Peace"
2,Bad ear buds,these headphones have great sound.. but the earbuds are cheap and annoying .. they're made of this cheapie foam that doesnt feel quite right.. For the price though they're really not that bad a deal if you dont mind the foam...
2,Cheap bass,"I totally agree with a previous reviewer. These do improve the bass, but at the expense of the mids and highs. Sound is very muddy. The foam plugs fit ok but the time it takes to place them in the ear properly was enough to make me decide these were not very practical."
1,These are junk,"I bought these in February, and used them sporadically for a couple months before first one earphone seemed to short out, giving inconsistent sound, then the other one within a week so now they're garbage. Don't bother buying this cheap junk. The sound quality is terrible and they don't last."
1,"Horrible sound, uncomfortable","Maybe I got the earlier version mentioned in some of these reviews (off ebay, package looked like the picture here) but I found them very disappointing, tinny horrible sound compared to other earphones I have used especially Koss PortaPro which is GREAT. This one has no bass, and extremely uncomfortable and poorly fitting -- the soft foam earpiece has something hard in the middle, doesn't keep shape or stay in. I'm glad it was only a few dollars otherwise I would have felt ripped off and tried to return them.... I guess you do get what you pay for in earphones...."
2,Sound quality,I am rating these headphones with 2 stars due to the fact that the bass is lacking. They advertise them as having tremendous bass response but the ones that came with my Sandisk mp3 player sound better! These have almost no bass and sound tinny. I bought them basically for comfort and because they fit inside the ears but now I am using my old ones anyway. I would not recommend these.
5,These get the job done,"I needed some earphones that would be more comfortable and louder than the cheap earbuds I had. I'm very happy with these on both accounts, and as a bonus they are much cheaper than a lot of the other options."
4,These are now the only earbuds I use,"Since the early days of ""the Plug"" I have probably had about 6 or 8 pair. I use them with my ipod, for private guitar practice in my office during lunch, and for watching training videos on a portable DVD player. Are there better earbuds out there? ABSOLUTELY! But not for the price. These fit well, when inserted properly, keep out a lot of the extraneous noise, are perfectly comfortable and have an acceptably good quality of sound. I keep thinking I will buy a more expensive, higher quality set of earbuds, but I have been so happy with these that I just can't bring myself to spend the extra dough!"
3,"Sound is good, cables are horrid.","Sound is good from these cans, though not excellent. They do a fair job isolating outside noise, though quickly over time the foam stiffens on the earpieces. The audio quality is basically what I'd expect at this price point, so no real complaint there.But the cables are terrible. Stiff and they transfer the noise of everything they touch. Any slight movement that rubs against the wires translates that sound into your ears. If you want to sit perfectly still, that's not a problem. But terrible for the gym or most any other part of life that includes movement on your part."
5,Very good noise isolation,They are very comfortable and fit nicely and securely in the ear canal. This fit is better than silicon earbuds. The sound quality I'd much better than any earbud in this price range.
2,"Will break after 3-5 months, warranty is a joke","Don't expect these to last for more than 3-5 months before one of the sides stop working. Used them for ~1 hr a day 5 days a week for exercising, and they broke after 3 months. Very poorly made, and $9 for a warranty replacement."
5,Best In-Ear Headphones I've Used!,"I just purchased a pair of Koss ""The Plug"" Portable Stereophones and they are wonderful! Picked them up at K-Mart for $14.99. Opposed to other reviews, I had no problem getting them in my ears. Perhaps I just have big ears. Unlike ear bud headphones, these cause your ears no pain during long listening sessions. Since the cusions on the headphones expand to fit your entire ear canal, most outside noices are muffled out. I'm using them as I type this review and can't even hear myself type. Also, they provide great sound quality and you definatly don't need to crank the volume up while listening (unless you want to be deaf). As I said, these are comfortable headphones, great for long listening sessions, at a great price. If you're in the market for in-ear headphones, I would definately pick up a pair of Koss ""The Plug"" Portable Stereophones."
2,Good sound but don't stay in the ear.,"I found no way in 2 years to get these earbuds to stay in my ears, but if they did the sound would be awesome - very deep bass and no outside noise."
2,"Yes, it's all that but the sound is *awful*","Here's the good stuff: great isolation from outside noise, comfortable, damned near excellent bass, and very power efficient. But I'm returning my pair to Tower Records where I just bought them for $15. Why? Because the sound itself is truly awful: compressed, dead, flat, hazy, and tinny (the great bass notwithstanding). These 'phones literally suck the life out of my music, by destroying its dynamics, detail, rhythm, tonal accuracy, and high frequencies, and then layering a harsh fuzziness on top of that. I can't say enough bad things about the actual sound. I suspect you can have a more rewarding musical experience at your dentist's office. I know I did."
2,Not comfortable at all - even modified,"I owned a pair of the older (blue and yellow) Koss Plugs and I modified them to fit better using Flents earplugs instead of the one Koss supplied (see the Headwize website for modifications you can do.) Those worked ok (though they were still a little uncomfortable.) When I ordered this new version of Plugs I could not get them to fit right and the sound was really tinny. Fortunately I found the Sony EX-70LPs. Much more comfortable than these, thank goodness! No earphones fit everyone well, and the Koss earphones don't work well at all it you have shallow ears. The Sony's also cost three times more than the Koss, but the comfort is worth it."
1,Only the name is the same,"I've owned 3 pairs of ""The Plug"" over the last several years and was always impressed with the good performance. I bought a set for my wife this month and what is being sold as ""The Plug"" today is in no way the same as what it was previously. Today's incarnation of ""The Plug"" is substantially less expensive than in the past and it shows in every way. I compared these side-by-side with my 2 year old pair of ""The Plug"" and both the build quality and the sound quality are far inferior on today's version. In particular the sound is atrocious. They are very tinny, lack dynamic range, balance and definition. I wouldn't take a pair if they were given to me. Save your money."
4,"Excellent sound, durabilty, and price","These headphones produce deep bass, clear treble, and cancel out the majority of noise around you. I had a previous model of the Koss Plug headphones for about two years before they died. This model fits even better than the last, and was less expensive. I would recommend this product to anyone who is active, as these headphones have never fallen out of my ears."
5,"Koss ""The Plug"" Portable Headphones",These are actually a replacement. My first set lasted for a few year and needed another. Best earbuds for the money hands down!
2,"Sound good, but probably won't stay in YOUR ears!","These earphones sound quite good for the price. However, after owning two pairs over the last couple years & experimenting with them in every way I can think of, I cannot get them to stay inside my ears. You would need to have a very large ear canal to keep them secure & not popping out. Koss gives you different size covers, but all of them do the same thing; within a minute or two, these always pop out. The cord is also unnecessarily long. It is a shame, because they do sound quite good, and when they are in securely, they isolate noise around you, making it possible to hear a great deal of detail in music. I recommend you spend a bit more money & buy the Shure E2c earhones, which give you a number of ear canal fittings, and which sound VERY MUCH better."
2,Earphones,"These weren't as good as I'd hoped. When I put them in, it made my music too loud, the least thing they fell out, generally they did not work for me."
3,Not so great,"In my opinion, the regular ipod plug have better audio quality and they stay in my ears better. These ones are just so-so and were a replacement for my ipod ones i broke. I think i will get some different ones because they only sound okay on one of the ipod audio settings, which is loud, anything else and it sounds muffled or too bassy.Ok I am editing this and if I could change my stars to one I would. These earbuds are horrible. They refuse to stay in my ear and the foam part falls off so easily. The sound quality is horrendous, plain and simple. I am upgrading to something better."
2,Kinda bad,these are by far the best earphones you can get. they fit in your ear and offer good isolation but just doesnt compate to open ear headphones. my Koss KSC-75 were a lot better.
4,Soooo comfortable,These feel great and the sound is awesome. They are so light and they cancel out the noise around me pretty well. I gave 4 stars because I'm not a fan of the purple color.
3,Ear Pieces come off easy,"Within a day or two the headphone came off very easy off one of them, they are made to be taken off so you can put new ones on, since two sets are included, but one of them would just keep coming off. Maybe it was how I was using them, but should have held up better."
3,could not get plugs to fit,"Cannot accurately assess audio quality since the provided ear plugs did not fit properly, making it impossible to create adequate sound isolation."
2,Poor sound and fit!,These did not sound well at all and fit was even worse. Ears got tired after just a few minutes during one song!
2,Dissapointing,"I ordered a pair of these because of all of the positive reviews that I saw on this site. When I got them today, I was very dissapointed. I had alot of trouble getting them to stay in my ears. I cant even try to walk around with them in because they just fall right out. I could understand if I had big ears, but they are average size. Also, the sound quality sucks. They are decent if you can get a perfect seal around your ear, but if the seal is not perfect they produce NO bass. The Koss Clip headphones are better sounding, cheaper, and fit better. Get those instead!"
4,I love these headphones,"I bought a pair of these headphones in the hopes of being able to listen to music/news while riding my motorcycle. I could not believe how good they sound and how much road noise they block out. I use to use a pair of behind the ear clip on headphones. I would have to listen with the volume at max at not be able to hear very well, but I would be able to hear. These buds rock!!! I can listen with the volume turned down to half. What suprised me the most was the amount of bass that these little buds kick out. I had to turn the settings for bass down to get it to sound right to me. All other headphones have to have the bass almost maxed out. I have read where others have to readjust them to get them to fit correctly. I guess Im lucky. I used the foam plugs that fit my ears best and have had no trouble. I now use them when I run, ride, or just am hanging out. I love them. They are well worth the 14 bucks"
4,Fix for foam plugs falling out,(...)these are great ear phones.I had the same problem as other reviewers with the foam plugs not staying in my ears.My solution was to replace the foam plugs with a set of plugs I fashioned from a set of ear protection plugs. These are the yellow foam plugs you can buy at the hardware store to protect your ears from leaf blowers and other high decible equipment.The yellow foam plugs can be compressed more and they then slowly expand in your ear for a snug fit. They stay in until you pull them out.I made a hole in the foam plugs for the plastic tube that comes with the Koss phones.
2,"save the money, buy better headphones","When my husband bought me these headphones I was thrilled for two reasons. One, my ipod earphones are terribly designed and two, I am always happy to buy a product from a company headquartered in my hometown, however, I cannot stand these headphones, they are contstantly falling out of my ears and they sound tinny, for lack of a better word. They may be cheap, but I would be willing to shell out the extra cash for nicer headphones anyday, especially if you use them often."
4,Excellent for the price,"I had a pair of the old L-jack ones that lasted me several years. They broke, tragically, with I put them in a bag that got crushed. I replaced them with a pair of the straight jack style and they didn't last 8 months before the right channel all but stopped working. But I'm going to get another pair because:they isolate sound -really- well: it could be dangerous if you're walking or etc.the sound is good: most earbuds are too treble-y but these are well-balancedthey're comfortable: I don't care for cold metal bits in my ears. And the foam is more comfortable than silicone.they're cheapthey're not hideous or flashyOnly downsides are that they'll break pretty easily if crushed and they're cheaply made (but they're cheap, so that's to be expected)."
2,Too tinny sounding,"I bought these to replace an old set of Koss earbuds I have.My old Koss earbuds don't have any ear foam for improved bass or ambient noise cancellation. I wanted something that would seal in the ear to give me fuller, richer sound.These do seal in the ear but the sound is way too tinny. I don't like them at all. I put them in the drawer as an emergency spare set and went back to my old Koss earbuds for now."
2,Design changed? Not as good now - less bass,"I've been using these headphones for a long time (several pairs over several years) and love them. That is, until I ordered a couple new pairs. Koss changed the design-- now they have a smaller plug to be compatible with the iPhone, but they no longer have the nice bass response."
2,Good sound but not comfortable,"I purchased a pair of these based on their positive reviews but received them and was not impressed. They only come with one size of ""plug"", and it didn't sit snugly inside the ear and instead felt like it was slipping out. But if you try to push them in deeper to make them more snug, the inner hard plastic tube scrapes and irritates the ear.The sound quality is good and the price is right, but I will be returning these for another pair of jbuds."
1,Horrible sound quality,Even if you are not an audiophile person you will certainly regret buying these headphones because despite a fully turned on treble and bass reducer the sound is muddy and much too bass dominating. The cables are very noisy when you move (e.g. in the gym). I guess there is no alternative to spending $60+ for acceptable noise canceling headphones.
2,"trust reviews, not amazon","I was quite disappointed with the order. I bought these primarily because the amazon description states that there was a 2.5mm adaptor included. This is not the case. I read the review from 2003 about the description errors BUT, I figured by 2007 amazon would have rectified this issue. Alas, I got bit. My first disappointment with amazon in many years of transactions. Yo AMAZON, if you read this please fix this 4 year old problem! As far as the sound quality these are acceptable ear buds and I will put them to use as travelers."
5,5 stars only because its 10 dollars...,"First of all, I think this is an over-rated product.When a buyer doesn't take into account the price, then they realize its not everything they were looking for.Yes, it sounds great, but the plug is a hassle to put in. The whole ""roll up the cushion and insert and hold in ear"" idea makes it a big turn off for me, mainly because there are many times when I do take off my earphones.Also, if you put it too far into your ear, then the pointy thing in the earphones will stick out and cause a bruise in your ear.I had to cut mine a little.All in all, its good.I give it 5 stars only because its 10 dollars.I have the sony mdr-ex81lp and its only 20-30 dollars if u find it right...go with that if u can...if u wanna be cheap, get this..."
4,"Koss ""The Plug"" ear buds.","Truly excellent!I hear things in music I've never heard before in music I've listened to on a very , very good stereo system for 40 years.They're also very comfortable."
1,"Great sound, but not the same plug as in the picture","I wanted the exact product as depicted, the in-ear head phone and since my phones tend to break at the plug, I wanted the bent one. Well, that wasn't deliverd. I wanted to send them back but realized that the last other pair of Koss in-ear head phones I bought here also promised the bent plug, and I got a straight one, therefore, no alternatives.I expect this to break within months, just like the other pair did."
3,Why you expect HIFI sound from $12 headphones?,"I can't simply understand nature of such negative feedbacks.Don't like sound quality/durability/usability/etc? - Check price tag, scratch your head, try to find same durability/usability/etc for same price, I bet you can't.So this headphones perform amazingly well, compared to their $12 price tag. So don't expect $100 quality from these.If you still wonder what quality of sound these have, here's comparison with other KOSS products. This (The Plug), sounds worse than Koss Porta Pro, but sounds better than Koss UR10 (but you need heavy EQ usage to actually set these ""plugs"" to be better then UR10). Hope this helps."
5,Awesome buds.,"Koss makes the best stuff. These block outside noise, have great sound quality, and are comfortable enough to wear all day."
1,Not worth it.,"I wanted to give earphones a chance because I look totally old school with my behind-the-neck headphones. These worked fine for about a week, then the volume adjuster on the wire gave up and distorted the sound. They isolate you from everything going on around you, which can be dangerous. They're hard to put in and not very comfortable. What a piece of crap, given how much it costs. Don't buy these."
1,Disappointing!,Not worth even the twelve bucks...the buds I got for $2 on my last plane ride have as good a sound and are more comfortable.
3,I dont like,I like:- Quality sound.I do not like:- Easily drop of my ears- I have to squeeze hard to fix the ear and it bothers.
3,"Koss ""The Plug"" - an unremarkable product",Sound is fine and comparable to other earphones in this price range. Wiring is delicate and requires carefully handling to avoid damage. Foam earpieces don't stay in place as much as I had hoped (the main reason I chose this model).
2,"Used to be great, now seriously lacking","I've bought these in the past, but they've changed them recently. They used to have a fuller sound, more bass, but now they are tinny sounding. They also used to have a more durable cord and plug, but now they are really much more poorer quality. I'm disappointed. For the price, they're ok, but don't expect much from these barely passable earbuds."
2,piece of crap,"they were great for about a week then the foam got all mushy and wouden't go in. my advice, save you money and get some real noise cancling ones"
1,Good sound very poor construction,Ear plugs sound good but the rubber plugs kept slipping off the stem that the rubber mounts on. Not worth the time fighting to keep them on. Not sure if the rubber plugs are defective or just a bad design. I would recommend another product.
1,uncomfortable and poor sound,"I suppose I have smaller ears than some people, I do have trouble getting any sort of earbud head phone to stay in place, but ""The Plug"" is a really bad fit for me, they fall out just moving my head slightly. And the sound? tinny and buzzy. Some people seem to like them, but they were a complete waste of money for me.I like the wrap-around, behind the neck headphones much better. The Sonys are OK, but Phillips have some really good & inexpensive ones."
1,"Not the most comfortable, nor the best sound quality.","I usually have avoided Koss before because of their cheap construction, but after seeing these among other quality headphones, I figured I would give them a try. These promised better sound qualtiy than your average $10 headphones, but after using them for 5 minutes, I realized that I was probably better off buying cheaper headphones. The cords are a really thin guage wire, the ""ear cushions"" do not really fit comfortably, and the ""big bass sound"" is almost non-existant unless you push and hold them in your ear. All in all they sound really ""tinny"" and the midrange is pretty bad.Coming from a pair of sony earbud style headphones(which I used for years before they broke), I think I am going to get rid of these and go back to my trusty old sony headphones...atleast then I know I am getting what I pay for."
5,makes gurdjieff's ideas clear,"5 stars because ""gurdjieff: a beginner's guide"" is a manual for those who are interested in a path that takes work.i read ouspensky's "" strange life of ivan osokin"", and i needed help understanding the ideas behind the novel. gil friedman provides that help. a masterpiece of clarification. you will be glad you did."
5,Superb primer,"I don't understand the criticism's to this book. This book covers every major teaching of the 4th way on the basic levels of understanding. It's not meant to be a deep comprehensive commentary on the Work. The author accomplishes the task very well. This has been a great help, having had read many of the books on the Work and having joined a group six months ago. The teachings of a true Work group unfold very slowly. A true group isn't about lectures, it's experiential. I highly recommend trying out a work group. There are listing sites of groups all around the world. This book will help you understand the most practical, and yes, more basic and surface level understandings that will deepen as you progress."
3,"A beginners's guide to Ouspensky via Nicoll, not Gurdjieff","The author apparently has not even read Gurdjieff, certainly not ""Beelzebub's Tales."" The whole thing is based on Nicoll's Commentaries. Nicoll was a student of Ouspensky's and met Gurdjieff only briefly. Ouspensky, a hopeless intellectual, may have understood the occult teachings in Gurdjieff's system but there's no evidence that he understood and more important practiced Gurdjieff's exercises. The exercises are why it's called The Work. Gurdjieff's system is about waking up, not sleeping through life with a particular belief system as your pillow. I've seen little evidence that any of G's students ever actually woke up except fitfully - perhaps Madame de Salzmann did but not Ouspensky and certainly not Nicoll. If you want to understand Gurdjieff go to the source."
3,disappointing,"this book disappointed me. i expected some insights into the ""secrets"" of life because a friend of mine keeps telling me how profound the teachings of gurdjieff are. however, this book reminds me of so many positive thinking books that try to convince you that the only thing that you have to do to change your life is to change your attitude. pretty basic stuff that could be covered in an email. it doesn't take a whole book to say ""change your thinking and you will change your life."""
5,Glad I read the book,"This book provides a good introduction and overview to the Gurdjieff work while at the same time giving the reader tools to implement the ideas. The book is not just another positive thinking guide, rather it describes techniques for cultivating detachment, relaxation, and mental discipline within the context of the Gurdjieff perspective on human nature. Along the way, Gil Friedman incorporates examples from his personal life as well as anecdotes from literature and history in an easy to read, flowing style. I'm glad I read the book."
4,A clear and down to earth intro to Gurdjieff & his system.,"I greatly enjoyed this introduction to Gurdjieff, truly as the title states 'A Beginners Guide'. There are lots of useful tips here for practice, and the author makes a point of explaining that this system is a practical one rather than theoretical. The best thing though (in my opinion) is the author's honesty, experience, and self-referencing to the Work-- he doesn't make out that he is a guru or some sort of 'master', but simply explains what has worked for him (and his group), some personal opinions (which are also accurate and useful), and how someone else might be successful in learning and applying G's teachings.. especially in starting a beginners group. Recommended."
2,Absolute beginners beware!,"I've purchased many technical beginner books over the years; this one has to be the least useful. Several of the examples are ultimately the same basic procedure but repeated over and over again. The book lacks the key building blocks essential to learning VBA. I find it hard to believe anyone could learn the language by simply copying these examples without a use case or additional information how to alter the code to make it more useful and flexible.I recommend the Mr. Excel series of VBA books if you really want to learn how to program Office apps, they have been the most productive VBA learning tools I've come across. They build slowly though very useful/real-world problems by adding to the complexity and at a pace that allows you to understand each successive step.Save your money, look for something else."
3,Not the best introduction to VBA,"I think I would qualify as an intermediate user of Access, and was looking to broaden my horizons by learning VBA. After a few chapters of this book, I couldn't continue with it. I found the author's technique of ""here's a lot of information, but you don't know enough to use it yet, but it's still very important so don't forget it"" to be a bit annoying. I would much rather the author goes through the basics with me, rather than jump ahead and hope I can remember what he's said once I can apply the knowledge four chapters later. Also annoying were the ""funny"" pictures of people scattered throughout the book - this was enough to steer me away from this series of books forever."
1,Little useful information.,"This books has almost no useful code, and does not go into enough depth to demonstrate how to write any useful code. Fortunately, I found everything I needed on several VBA websites. I wish I had saved the $18.95..."
3,Fruity rooibos!,"Celestial Seasonings is branching out and using Rooibus as a base for some of their newer fruit flavored herbal teas. Rooibos is naturally caffeine free and high in antioxidants. African Orange Mango is a strongly orange scented and flavored with a hint of mango aftertaste. It has no sourness at all. I think it would make a really nice ice tea. It is a tasty brew that is almost as good as their Moroccan Pomegranate Red Rooibos tea.Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.Quote from the box:""Love will draw an elephant through a keyhole."" Samuel Richardson."
3,A little weak,I think the Twinings plain Rooibos tastes much better. This one comes up a bit weak with an orange kool-aid flavor. Its good..just not great.
3,Good album but poor band stability,"Good debut album but no more than a two months after its release the singer left and just recently the keyboardist left as well, and there have been no replacements.Not a good start for a band that just put out an excellent debut cd, sadly a cd that will see very little attention and no band to tour just makes those chances even slimmer.David Shankle was a big enough name and a good enough player who could have probably hooked up with another band (ie. Queensryche) had he played his cards right. I can understand him wanting to do his own thing and get his own band, but to do it in this fashion with the subsequent outcome didn't help him any.Cd is recommened"
4,GREAT ALBUM WITH ONE PROBLEM!,Being a huge fan of Roxette I was happy to buy this album with all of their greatest hits all on one CD! Great selection of songs they chose! My only compaint is that the new songs are not as gratifying as the older songs. I hope when their new album ROOM SERVICE is released it is a better balance! Glad to see them back!
4,Joyride down memory lane,"Well it's a pity that the fickle-minded audience turned their backs on possibly one of the most illustrious Swedish pop band since Abba. In the late 80s and early 90s, Roxette's star shone brightly with such hits like The Look, Listen To Your Heart, Dress For Success and their last major hit It Must Have Been Love. And then they inspired such bands like Savage Garden whose I Want You sounds like a good rip-off of Joyride. On this collection of hits, you'll find the international release Wish I Could Fly plus three other new songs 5 years later than the rest of the world. But better late than never. Relish!"
3,Get the import instead!!,"This is a nice collection, but the import release from 1995 is far superior. The import has 18 tracks including the great ""June Afternoon"" (a very psychedelic nod to the '60's), the european hit ""The Big L"" and the rocker ""She Doesn't Live Here Anymore"". The import is well worth an extra couple of bucks!!!"
4,This one has all the U.S. hits,"Every other Roxette hits CD (do there have to be so many?) is missing one or more of the group's U.S. chart hits. This one appears to have them all, so it's the one I got.Hooks that ring in your head for hours. I can't listen to this on the way to work or I will be humming like a fool. Great pop music from the late Eighties and early Nineties."
4,beautiful cover,"The dustjacket has a lovely combination of two city scenes. Very colourful, and it is a pity that Amazon's product page lacks this image.Perhaps the cover acts as an optimistic setting for the book. The contributors talk about the future of American cities. Looking at cultural, demographic and economic trends that might or could impact how the future will turn out. There are warnings about how it is quite possible, if not probable, for a city administration to muck things up. Minimal taxes and regulations on businesses are advocated, to encourage a vital economy. But the problems of disadvantaged underclasses is not ignored. Suggestions are made for greater inclusion of everyone in a future prosperity."
3,Streetwise Amsterdam Map,"This map seems nice, but it doesn't have all of Amsterdam on it! If you're going anywhere outside of the city center, try a different map."
1,Streets and fonts are way too tiny to read,"This map would be great if it were about twice as large, but so much is crowded into this tiny folding map that you need a BIG magnifying glass just to see it. A much better map is in the back of the Eyewitness ""Pocket Map and Guide Amsterdam"""
3,Hard to read,"I took this map to Amsterdam but wound up leaving it in the hotel room because it's so hard to read. The print is tiny, and the gray/black color scheme doesn't help. Although it omitted many small streets, the free map offered by our hotel was more useful.Ideally, you would carry this nicely indexed map to use when you are thoroughly lost among small neighborhood streets and a free hotel map for public transportation and convenient reference."
2,Too Big and Not Enough Detail,"Yes, I want it all. And this map did not give it. First, this map is huge. It's too big for a small purse or pocket. Second, this map lacks a lot of detail. I opened this once during our trip and it didn't help. Thankfully, I bought two other maps, which were not only smaller, but had every street and alley name on them (check out the pocket maps)."
3,"Convenient, but lacks detail","I set out from central station with this map to check out Amsterdam. I found myself lost before long, and was able to use the map to interpolate between landmarks and get back over to Dam Square. However, the small streets are not on this map, so it's generally useless for figuring out exactly where you are and how to get where you are going."
4,Good Tool Book,"I thought this to be an interesteing book. As a whole, its tools dddn't klump together, but individually the are awesome. The personal storie are informative and good for giving you a better idea of how to apply this tools. I disagree with the way he presents them, as though you could apply everyone of the tools in every situation. I believe like everything, there is a time and place for each of them. I recommend that you read this (make sure you understand and can apply it) then read Seven Habits of Highly Effective People and First Things First by Robert Covey."
4,Powerful Ideas Tested Under Extreme Stress,"The author says that SEALs comb the earth for the best training available. I guess, this is true, because the book is filled with powerful ideas adopted from different fields and tested under extreme stress of life-threatening situations.First, you have several ideas from NLP. ACTE model is almost a copy of NLP's T.O.T.E. model. Fear Crusher has NLP's Belief Change Pattern underlying it. And verbal-influence conditioning is called ""limiting beliefs"" in NLP.Another interesting application comes from yoga. Consider the description of the author's experience at the sniper school in the context of yoga's ideas of focus, awareness and being in the present moment.So, I guess, this book is powerful because it is based on powerful ideas. And those are described clearly, using real life examples.Highly recommended."
3,Worth reading if you haven't already read Unlimited Power,"I think this is a good solid read but the thing I find peculiar is its similarity to the Anthony Robbins book Unlimited Power. A lot of the techniques and ideas I see in this book I have read in the other, especially the ACTE formula.Maybe Machowicz borrowed ACTE from Anthony Robbins, because Anthony Robbins Ultimate Success formula is EXACTLY the same, just phrased differently. They even have the same number of steps. Also I bought this book on the fact it had 60 5 star reviews. I rated it three because that was the halfway point.Let me pound into your brain the fact that everything Machowicz teaches is taught in Unlimited Power. Looking back, if I was to choose between Machowicz book or Robbins, I'd probably go for Machnowicz's simply because his is a lighter read and I find the navy SEAL anecdotes to be particularly interesting.If you haven't already read Unlimited Power read this book instead."
3,Some good tidbits,"There was some good information in the book but mostly things that common sense would cover and what most of us do that he re-defined and put in a differnt context. A lot of it has to do with autosuggestion and a kind of self-hypnosis for accomplishing our goals and he uses a method for success using a technique he refers to as ""Target, Movement, Weapons"". There were a couple of good tibits of information about facing and controlling fear which was what I was looking for and which is what the SEAL(s) have to do as part of their training and job. A little too much ego came though in the book which takes away from the message which is why I only gave it 3 stars."
2,"An inspiring story, but taught me almost nothing","I consider myself more than a novice in the area of personal development, and was excited to get this book as the title is compelling. I must say that aside from learning about how challenging it is to become a navy seal (not among my aspirations but interesting), I learned very little. Very little entertainment value, and the theories were not very well thought out in my opinion. Still, not a 1star because there were some diamonds in the rough:The Carver Matrix, the Action Mindset, the step-by-step planning model, course correction after action is taken, use of power, and a few other areas had me thinking. But not everything has application, and the suggesting of a way to find lost keys (or whatever) had me looking foolish and my keys were no sooner found. Richard needs practice and a refinement in his theory, and lots of applications for the average gal, but I see potential."
2,"Wow, you're so big and tough","The author mostly talks about how hard his training in the SEALS was. What good does that do the normal person? If anything, it makes your life seem simple and easy and that doesn't exactly motivate a person. He introduces the book by saying that he'll give techniques to ""unleash the warrior within"" but all he does is present a simple idea like 'focus' and then talks about experiences in the SEALS. The book isn't good as a motivational/training guide and it's not good as an informative piece on the SEALS. It's a little of both and that makes it very weak (unless you're training for the SEALS and need to unleash your warrior within at the same time)."
5,Success tools you can apply immediately,"One of the most valuable verifiable lessons from this book is how far we can go beyond our own self imposed limitations and of course the author's personal story is a great point of reference to remind us of that reality.I integrated this lesson into my daily tools and was amazed how my mind's ""tricks"" with exhaustion, thirst and all kind of other excuses to interrupt my difficult tasks gave way to levels of productivity and achievement I had never experienced before.This book is now a must-read for my business advisory clients.I still feel I have only applied a small fraction of what the author has developed into a system and being a slow learner it will be a little while before I can report on the full potential of this book, even though I have already seen amazing results.What I also like about this book is the nice balance between personal experience of the author and how he uses that to reinforce the concepts.This book is now glued to my desk!"
4,A clean and focused way to get the results you want,"This book takes some complex ideas and breaks them down into small bite size chunks. It never gets boring and preachy. He teaches you how to streamline your thinking so that it's easier to concentrate though the internal battle (doubt, fear, lack of skill and confidence) that wages inside you and effects the way you present yourself to the people and situations you face daily. It is a quick and fun read that left me wanting more, which from my experience with books in this genre is highly rare."
5,Military Veteran / Martial Artist,"Practical, Tactical, and a must for every veteran with a love and passion for the martial arts...""Mack"" knows how to give you the perfect mix of advice to really 'take it to the next level' in your life!"
4,Great self improvement book,"One of the best self improvement books I have read. Mack gives you the tools to help you recognize what really matters to you so you can put more of your resources towards that goal. The only reason I'm giving this book 4 stars, rather than 5, is because this was written when he was trying to get the word out about Bukido - his self defense training. So many of his tools are trademarked and it became annoying reading through so many trademarks. There is also one lengthy chapter where he goes off on a tangent - that seemed like filler to me - and the chapter could have been reduced to 5 pages.Overall, the tools really do come in handy, and I have already been able to utilize some of them. Certainly worth the read."
5,Life Changing,What a great book! When I first read the book I thought I was going to learn about self defense. Little did I know that I would learn about changing my life. Once I used the exercises in the book I really began to focus and take positive steps to achieve my goals
3,Good stories....but not very helpful.,"This book is easy to follow, and has some great stories from Mack's experiences; however, it sorely lacks any really motivational or really helpful information. If you want to read all about his SEAL stories then this is the book for you. If you want to overcome fear, gain confidence, discipline and etc....keep looking."
5,"Another ""Weapon"" to Add to My Arsenal","I saw this book when I was searching the site for books on leadership and was very curious about its contents. I convinced myself to give it a try. After I ordered the book and read it in 2 days, I have definitely found a new arsenal of ""weapons"" that will help me accomplish any goal or objective in front of me. This was a really good book and I'm recommending it to any one who wants a straight-forward, simplistic approach to getting things done and going after want you really want out of life."
3,"Not bad, but looking for better","I've been using this for about a month now and it works pretty well. I've also used The Art of Shaving's pre-shave lotion and while they seem to work, I *hate* the greasy, oily feel they both have. Granted, after you've shaved, your face doesn't feel greasy, but it still kind of grosses me out. I've used Zirh's pre-shave oil and it's not greasy whatsoever. I think I'm going to go back to that or I'm going to keep looking."
5,I can feel the difference.,"I started straight razor shaving, and my face was looking more and more like Edward scissorhands. I have very sensitive skin, and don't shave everyday for that reason. Not even with the 8 blade razors (or whatever the count is right now.)The oil has a very strong, minty scent, which is pleasant. I do feel the difference since I started using it. Combine it with a nice aftershave lotion, and you will be jumping for joy at how smooth your face feels afterwards. Of course, everyone is a critic, so results will vary. Personally, would recommend to others to try. The price tag is a tad steep, so see if someone you know has some to try."
3,More Thick and Sticky than Slick,"I was expecting an extremely slick oil that would allow the razor to glide across my face. This oil is thick and sticky, almost like melted peppermint. It is not very slick, and I'm not sure if it enhances the shave at all. I am generally satisfied by Anthony Logistics, but I will try another brand's pre-shave oil next time."
1,Fast Pouring - Uninspiring,"I was attracted to the price but after trying this, it is a fast flowing river that does not inspire. The handy (for them) FAST and Large pouring top guarantees that you will waste a lot. There is no pleasant aroma and it feels, well like OIL. I have used Musgo Real pre-shave oil for years. That is what I am going back to. Muskgo costs $10 more but will last a good six months. It also does not have the motor oil effect that Anthony has."
2,A sticking point...,"I am accustomed to REN Tamanu High Glide Shaving Oil. I preface this review as such because the REN oil is a stark contrast to this Anthony product. Your preferences and prior experiences will likely dictate whether this is the product you are after. I found that the Anthony oil applies thick and leaves your skin feeling 'sticky' in a way I was not prepared for from a pre-shave oil. I use it sparingly after wetting my hand with warm water and rubbing the oil for a few seconds before massaging it into my beard. I don't often shave, so, when I do, my whiskers are lengthy--and most often pre-buzzed by a beard trimmer prior to the shave itself. This product does seem to soften my beard up a bit and prepare it for the shave, but I much prefer the experience with REN. This is my first bottle (now about halfway done) and I don't think I'll be getting a second."
1,Not what I thought,"I am not glad with this product. Its like engine oil, it does not make to your shave, it also has a falavor like mint.I rather recomend you a nuew gillete GEL (not foam, foam sucks) sensitive skin, match 3. The one with color green.I will try another preshave oil to see if i have luck."
1,"A horror, but not a thriller","This is another Universal horror film from the 1940's, when both budgets and quality levels shrank dramatically. ""House of Horrors"" is one of the worst of the genre, with an inept cast and an idiotic plot. The only cast member capable of generating either interest or sympathy is Rondo Hatton; the others are forgettable. Interesting only as a curiosity. The real horror here is the astonishing level of ineptitude it took to make a movie this bad."
4,happy Customer,"I didn't expect this to be made available on cd, so I'm quite pleased. Delivered quickly and efficiently in perfect shape."
5,Remarkable account of a walk on the wild side in China,"This is an enjoyable account of a clash of cultures and a discovery of (gay) sexuality. It's setting in China and lesbian theme reminded me of another book I read lately, ""White Snake and Other Stories"" by Geling Yan, who is of the same generation as this author. This is another place where China is starting to exit the closet, much to its own surprise."
4,Price Is Right,"I bought this ring as an extra for my husband so he could wear it to his construction job. I didn't want him wearing his original diamond ring that I pd $1200 for, so gave this one a try. To my surprise this ring is very nice, clean finish. Also is very durable, I would purchase from this company again."
5,Great Ring,Great Ring for the price. Shinier than the image but a great all around ring. Scratches easily but that was expected. I bought it for everyday use so I have something to figit with.
5,"Pretty ring, great customer service","It's a nice ring. Looks great. But the outstanding thing is Sabrina - they shipped product out very quickly. I goofed with wrong ring size due to Amazon size chart (definitely, get a professional to size you, although he ended up giving me a too small size too) and Sabrina changed it with no hassles, quickly."
3,buying rings online is just hard.,buying rings online is just hard. It's either too loose or too tight and you end up wearing on another finger.
5,even better in person!,ordered this ring for my husband to wear to work so that he doesnt hurt his more expensive ring and am pleasently surprised at the quality.it looks way better in person than in the picture and he says it feels great on! we also recieved the ring within 3days of it being shipped from the seller so that was a plus as well.
4,a good value,"This is a good ring. It looks good, Its comfortable, and it doesn't cost a lot. And, as every jewelry maker knows, a ring gets the worst beating and wear of any kind of jewelry, so being stainless steel helps it stand up to wear."
4,silver ring,I have order from this company befroe and everything that I have recieved was awsome. I couldn't ask for anything better and with Amazon i get it super quick. I have came back to order other stuff and it's all the same great service.
4,Very nice ring,"Length:: 0:53 MinsThe ring Looks great, and feel great, it's well done, polished, and feels durable. nothing to complain about the ring. just one thing about the seller, that send me a 9.5 ring instead of a 10, not a big deal for the price,maybe this particular ring has a wrong scale, because the other 6 rings ive bougth together are ok in size, its just this that was wrong. ive uploaded a video, with the ring and the size bar ive used."
2,irritating,"looks great, fits great, but after one day of wear i was having a skin reaction under the band. i kept it on for another day and it kept getting worse. i switched hands to be sure and had the same problem. it took a week for the rash to go away. at least it was cheap, but still annoying."
3,Drop The Annoying Gimmick,"The storyline is cute, Jaine and Company are likeable characters, but the author's gimmick of having Jaine say or do something, followed immediately by ""OK so I didn't really say/do that. What I really said/did is this"" is annoying to the point of distraction. Can the gimmick already -- this is a good series, and there's no need to continue something that annoying to try and sell it."
4,Delightfully fun to read!,"Murder mysterious aren't my usual genre, but this book would more accurately classified as chick-lit. It was laugh-out-loud funny, and was written with the same type of witty flare and snappy dialogue as Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic series, but with a much more responsible heroine and more realistic storyline. As I was reading along, I thought the murderer's identity was so predicatable, but I was way off-track, as lots of suprising twists are unraveled."

1,Not good enough...,"I bought these headphones to replace a pair Labtec LT-835s which I'd been using for five years. I am not an audiophile by any means, but the audio quality of these headphones does not meet my expectations. They sound kind of -- echo-y, I guess. Plus, the earcups are too small and the whole unit grips the head much too hard. These factors combine to make it a pain to use the TD-80 for more than 15 minutes at a time.The per-ear volume control sounds interesting (and even useful) but is not well implemented. The position and looseness of the dials makes it easy to jog one while you are putting them on or taking them off, throwing the L-R balance out-of-whack.I'm sending them back."
3,at a loss with koss,"just got these and am mildly disappointed. the fit is way too tight and the ear cups are too small making for a painful experience if worn for more than an hour. the individual volume controls have a limited range making them almost useless. the response is OK, pretty much what you could expect for a product in this price range. basically, this product is an inexpensive replication of phones usually found in a professional studio."
2,Dont get them! Spend the Extra money!,"I was debating between these and some facier pairs on ebay and boy did I regret it. These are heavy, bulky, and not comfortable on my ears. They sound pretty good, the base is great, but not worth giving up comfort. My neck even hurts wearing these because the headphone are so heavy. Its like putting a textbook on top of your heard for a couple of hours. Its also such a relief when i take them off for my ears. My ears were red. They should make them out of more plastic rather than metal. Next time I will spend the extra [money] to get a better pair."
3,Remember the old tin can phones,"I recently bought the TD-80 headphones and i must say i am not impressed at all. Remember the old Wendys commercial ""Wheres the Beef"" well i'm wondering wheres the Bass their isn't any at all it sounds very tinny and the idea to put volume controls on each speaker isn't the smartest idea you may also find yourself turning the volume up on whatever your listening to as i am right now listening to them. overall i don't know what headphones these other reviewers are listening to but not the ones i have."
3,There must be better.,"The radio station provides these, but I'm willing to invest in my own pair if there's something better. No beefs about the audio quality. The problems with these: 1. Tight, fairly heavy, uncomfortable. Can't stay with them for more than 5 minutes; 2. The separate volume controls on the phones are just a nuisance--they're always turned down, and it's very tricky to turn them up, especially without taking the headphones off; 3. They don't seem especially sensitive or efficient--I'm turning the control board monitor switch to almost full gain (in addition to the volume controls on the phones themselves) just to be able to hear myself; 4. The closed ear design is a drag--why would you want to be completely sealed off from your immediate environment? That doesn't even replicate the experience of hearing live music.I'm hoping that Sony, Panasonic, or Sennheiser has something better in this price range."
3,Spyder 2 is just OK,"I am not entire fond of the Spyder 2, but it is much better than Adobe Gamma. One catch is that it doesn't take into account the ambient lighting like the Eye One Display products. It also requires manual adjustment of the monitor controls rather than using a common, nearly universla interface to do it programatically. And last, they are VERY slow with drivers and do not release any WHQL certified drivers; this is a big deal if you want to use the hardware with Windows Vista x64 (you can't)."
3,Works ok,"Works ok, does smell bad and not washing your hair for the first two weeks while using this is a little on the unrealistic side. I was able to go three days max, then couldn't take the feeling. Can't use it on your eybrows, so you have to use dye on them anyway, or look kind of strange. The no lead formula is only sold in countries other than the US"
1,Don't waste your money.,I've been using this product for over 9 months with little to no success. Does not work on stubborn gray hair.... And Yes... I have used it religiously as instructed by the application sheet. Customer support is ridiculously slow and not very clear on answers. I personally would not recommend this to anyone. Stinky smell and leaves an unnatural feeling to your hair. Kind of sticky actually. Would rather just color my hair and be done with... If I could I would give no stars... Very disappointed....
2,Summer Heat Orange Hair,Product works..but if you live in a hot climate like Nevada/Arizona in the summer hair turns orange...look like a pumpkin head..
1,smell is worse than the liquid grecian,I like the liquid Grecian even though it smells alittle bad. This foam producat to me has a very strong stinky smell that gave me a migraine headache all night. I threw it in the trash and then ordered more of the liquid Grecian which I do like.
3,Graet to shop @ amazon,"Amazon is a great site to shop, when you not sure where to find them; You got Amazon to help you to locate. I was able to find Grecian Plus Gradual haircolor foam."
2,"Entertaining ""B"" flick.","Written & Directed by Chris T. McIntyre. With Pat Morita (of Karate Kid fame)and Danny Nelson (A Time to Kill), you'd think this movie would hold up better. Interesting plot line has Pinto & friends running from crazed Appalachian eco-terrorist backwoodsmen (led by Nelson)while Pat Morita leads the search for his missing friends. Should have been better, but either the script, the direction or the budget (or all three) just doesn't have what it takes."
1,Used,"I bought this item new and received a scratched up insert, the case was new looking but the insert was scratched and in the scratches it doesn't even look to be brass, almost just brass plated"
4,Awesome!,I've heard him sing live and he has an awesome and anointed voice! You will really enjoy this cd!
2,Don't beleive the hype! This project is weak!!,"If you're considering buying this CD, read this first. This project is NOT worth buying. It's good that we have another young man trying to come up in the gospel world, but this project just doesn't cut it. I really think that the majority of the reveiwers are related to this guy and are trying to hype his project! They're using words like ""hot"" to describe the CD. This CD is NOT HOT! if you want a hot gospel CD, get Kirk Franklin's project ""Hero."" Mark Holley missed the mark with this one."
1,Mark Holley and Celeste GET OUT OF TOWN! HA HA!,"Sister Celeste, you know nothing about gospel music! I know that you're close to Mark ""Chicken grease"" Holley! track 2 sounds like a SHAFT theme song reject. BUYERS BEWARE! Mark Holley's project is not hot or wonderful. Itz low budget! This is Detroit, we don't need anymore weak artists repping our great city. Mark go back to the studio and get it right! Please Detroit is begging u. Consumers, if you buy this Cd, sign up on ebay because you'll want to sell it right back! Freeman Hendrix for mayor!"
1,Product misrepresented,This product is not advertised correctly! It states it is a DVD and the DVD is not even included in the kit! You can't carry out the simulations without the DVD. Without the DVD the kit is useless!
5,What an exciting read!,"As a law junkie, I love a good courtroom thriller! However, I am often disappointed by stories that are entirely too predictable. This was not one of them. David Ellis intertwines the past and present brilliantly, leading to a conclusion I never saw coming! This is possibly the best book I've read all year."
4,"Great book - but pay attention & you will know ""who done it""","I liked this book - even though I knew ""who done it"" by page 158 (of the hardback). If I had been paying closer attention I would have suspected even sooner.Even figuring it out, the book has plenty of twists and turns and is a great read. Just knowing who did it still leaves lots of room for excitement over how the story will come out.To be fair to the author - he is fair to us. This isn't a Sherlock Holmes book where the characters know things we don't - all the clues and info are fairly placed in the story so you can see them if you want.When some of Turow's and Grisham's recent works have been less than satisfying, this book (and ""Line of Vision"") are fresh air to the legal thriller genre."
3,Body stocking,"First off, it looks great, and fits my wife well. The biggest issue for her is how ""itchy"" it is. I'm not sure if this is a problem across the board, or if its just her skin reacting to the material, but when it comes to something like this, comfort is nice to have. She doesn't wear it much, to my disappointment ;) because of the comfort of the product. I wouldn't say don't buy it, but I would like to make potential consumers aware that it could be a bit uncomfortable..."
4,Selling with Integrity,I was looking for a book that was basis in sales but at the same time I wanted to go beyond an intro level. This book meets my needs very well. I would recommend it to most anyone.
2,Total agreement with Gill,"I have first hand experience dealing with Ms. Morgen. I paid for and attended one of her 3 day courses. I even did some work for her. I was really excited to work with her at first, until I found out what kind of person she truly is. I totally agree with Gill's comments. Although many of her concepts have validity, I've seen her *not* use the same type of ""we"" space she advocates. I won't be specific, but I can say with certainty that I've never had a more unpleasant client experience. Ms. Morgen can be very rude, abusive and confrontational. Her opinion is if you don't agree with what she says then there must be something wrong with you. I would recommend this book for some helpful cold-calling tips, but I would not adopt Buying Faciliatation as my primary selling technique."
5,A Classic,"This book is not only a classic, but it is being updated by the author in a new edition that will cover the years 1990-2000!"
5,Cruncher Bags,"Although the Karachi Outpost photo/laptop backpack ended up being too large (due to my exchanging my 17"" for a 14"" laptop) I did still buy a Cruncher.These bags are awesome. They look like any ordinary backpack with absouletly nothing to give away the fact they are carrying 2-3 grand worth of electronics. They're very padded so I feel my D50 is safe as well as my computer. The shoulder straps are a little stiff to begin with because they are so padded but are getting broken in with use.When I'm not carrying my camera, the camera compartment is easily removed and replaced when I'm ready for shooting again.I highly recommend this bag/brand."
4,A must-read for Asian history buffs,"This is a groundbreaking history of Mongolia. Much of it is based on documentation that was locked in secret archives during Mongolia's 70 years as a Soviet sattelite. Never before have historians had access to records from the regime of Choibalsan, Stalin's appointed henchman in Mongolia. This volume thoroughly explains and documents Mongolian history from the earliest days until 1946. The author, Baabar, is a renown historian and politician in Mongolia. (I was an editor of an earlier version of this book.)"
1,Not Black Chrome. AT ALL,"Highly disappointed in this purchase. I was looking for and thought I had ordered a Black Chrome frame. What I got was a metal frame that was painted black. FOrget the fact that it was bent when it arrived. It's the description that is misleading. Unless you are looking for a heavy solid dark black license plate frame, I'd buy something else because that's what you're gonna get if you order this one. Since I took it out of the package they want to give me a partial refund. Not worth the hassle of returning and paying for shipping to return it, so I threw it in the garbage. You missed the mark on this one Amazon. I thought being an Amazon prime member for three years might get me a little extra service, but they could care less."
4,Good book for 1st four chapters,"Crowley's writing is witty and incisive. This is a good book to read for its first four chapters in which he explains the first four ""limbs"" of Yoga. The next four, in which he attempts to explain the remaining stages of Yoga has much reference to his Magick theory. So if you are unfamiliar with Magick (as I am), the material may lose you easily. All in all, it is not worth spending $9.95 for the book if you are looking only for its Yoga content. If you have access to a good library, I would suggest you borrow it and read it first before you decide to you want to own a copy of it."
5,Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.,"This is Crowley' second try at writing on Yoga, and he has expanded the information of Raja Yoga in the section entitled ""Yoga for Yellowbellies"" which the other reviewer wrote was about Magick. Mostly it talks about Mathematical certainties of the proof of the Yogic states wherein contradiction of the faculty of Reason is inevitable. I think that Crowley has wrote much more then those who never studied him have come to realize: his whole philosophy is concentrated into such texts as ""Book 4 parts I - IV,"" and ""The Equinox"": no other books will do more then lead the seeker to false beliefs: Perseverando is an excellent display of this."
1,false and Misleading Listing,"Home and Beyond offers this 6 pack of sponges. I ordered five 6 packs of sponges and Home and Beyond only sent five sponges. Not the 30 I ordered and paid for. My advice is do not do business with Home and Beyond or True Value when buying these 6 packs of sponges because neither of those two ships what the listing says. Until Amazon starts enforcing Home and Beyond and True Value to honor what they list in their offerings, IMHO then the buyers need to go somewhere else."
5,WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE?,"And they said authors didn't write like this anymore! In a cesspool of pop culture junk, a jewel is afloat! I just read both of R.M. Johnson's books back to back. ""The Harris Men"" is excellent. ""Father Found"" confirms what I already suspected. This man is a REAL writer. None of that relationship Harlequin romance fluff flying around these days that's being called fiction. Hopefully this is a sign of things to come and serious fiction that feeds the mind and spirit will once again make a return."
5,really good literature,i read this book this weekend. this author is excellent. zale was about as deep as a character could get.
4,VERY GOOD BOOK,"I SAW HIM ON TOUR TOO. HE WAS JUST IN TAMPA. I BOUGHT THE BOOK AND LIKED IT. IT WAS DARKER THAN HIS FIRST BOOK, BUT HE CAN WRITE HIS BEHIND OFF. IT WAS MONEY WELL SPENT"
2,Father Found or Neurotic Found?,"I loved The Harris Men. I was looking forward to Johnson's second book. I thought we would be reading about Founder Found getting families back together, the struggles of families trying to cope with their problems, why they separated and either stays together or the father left again. We never went into those households. Instead we had to deal with the demons of Zales live and of Franks past and his violence. The main characters were full of problems that took center stage..how depressing. Martin and Debra kept my attention. The other characters had to many issues for one book. In my opinion, putting and keeping families together was not the focus of the book. If men can identify with this story line then their are a lot of our men not sleeping at night."
5,Pure Enchantment!,"I heard one of the songs on Direct TV Satellite Easy Listening music channel and just had to have it. I was not disappointed. I now own Vol. 1 & 2 and both are AWESOME! It is the kind of enchanting music you can sing to, work to, drive to and relax to. These two albums are first class ""feel good"" music and I highly recommend them to anyone who loves easy listening music."
5,Extreamly Happy,"I purchased Volume 1, 2, & 3 from this seller as a Christmas present to go with our new ""Bose system"" Christmas present. The time from purchase to delivery went withour a single glitch and was kept inforned of all purchase and transaction details as well as shipping and delivery details. The product was in mint off the shelf condition, and the quality was as I had hoped it to be.We are thrilled to have found these items and with the professional maner in which Amizon functions.Gene in Arizona"
5,Want To Relax?,"I first heard Morisod's music on satellite radio. I found it quite pleasing to the ear. So I did some investigating via the internet and found some of his albums on Amazon.com.The actual discs were quite pricey it seemed. So I downloaded the 20 Melodies Pour Rever from the Amazon website at a fraction of the cost of the disc.If you're looking for some music to help you relax, this album might just be what you're seeking. It starts out with Memories from Cats and continues with a number of well known melodies with the Morisod treatment. His arrangements and presentation of the music are difficult to explain in words. ""Dreamy"" is the word that comes to my mind. I'd suggest going to Amazon.com to listen to clips of his music to see if it's something the listener might enjoy.For me, it's some of the most relaxing music I've ever heard."
2,boringness,this show was so relaxed and slow paced that if i'm ever having trouble falling asleep all i have to do is just pop in a shingu dvd and i'm off in lala land in no time. The show acts like there is going to be some action soon and there is a little bit but it doesnt really build up to anything. the storyline is kind of interesting but they didnt really pull it off well. So if your having trouble sleeping this is the show for you.
1,"Junk, Junk, Junk","My wife bought one of these 3 weeks ago.She loves the job that it does WHEN it works.So far (after 3 weeks of use):1. The safety valve failed2. The carrying handle broke off3.

4,YES BUT...,"IM A HUGE ANNA VISSI FAN BUT EVENTHOUGH THE CHOICE OF SONGS IS E-X-C-E-L-E-N-T THE RECORDING, SOUND AND PRODUCTION ARE TERRIBLE!!ANNA IS GREAT AS ALWAYS BUT TOO BAD WE CANT GET THE REAL PICTURE OF THAT NIGHT IN PLAKA.WHAT A PITY BUT STILL IS AN ALBUM TO BUY FOR..."
2,A Better Splash,"I would suggest that viewers watch two films, A Bigger Splash and another one, A Bigger Picture, done 40 years later, both deal with the evolution of David Hockney, painter. In viewing both films you will see how time changes him, from the young hormone, ego driven artist to a later reflective and sharing person. It is almost unbelievable the changes that occur in a person's life as reflected in these films. Very few artist have shared so much about their lives and art as does Hockney, most are reclusive or secretive especially about their process of creating. Hockney is not only an innovative artist but also a scholar, teacher and great screen personality."
1,Who Was This Movie Made For?,"David Hockney didn't like this movie. It was way too personal for Hockney (and too explicitly homosexual for the average heterosexual preference). He thought it was going to have a lot about his paintings and him talking about art. Instead it follows his failing relationship with his lover, Peter, who was a major inspiration of his paintings at that time.15% of this film is about art. There's about 8 minutes collectively of Hockney in his studio and painting. One minute of him talking about what's on his mind with art. Six or so, 20 second scenes where they re-create some of his great paintings at that time; and a few scenes where he's being hounded about his production and selling his art. And what's most interesting to me is he was in the middle of painting ""Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)""- so you see a little of the process of how that painting came about.Take away that 15%, what's left is a homosexual film that's poorly edited."
2,Good intro..weak on how-to's,If you need high-level information about Web services security and you don't have time to Google around for WS specs...then this the best read. If you are aspiring Web services developer or an architect who is interested about knowing the security architecture and implementation of web services security then this book may not help much.
2,we never called him henry,"A fantasy of truthlessness. Harry Bridges (and HF) were evil men. Harry was a bully of the Napeolean type. As usual, the tools of despots eventually get theirs - Harry was fired in 1945."
1,it doesnt work alone...,"amazon's website made it like you buy it and it works alone but no you gotta buy 100$ woth of bluetooth pen and pad to get this thing working, so if u r just looking for a wireless mouse this is not the one..."
1,If you buy this you craped out!,"Don't waste your money on this book. Even as a primer on the game of craps it falls way short. Most of the information contained is in the free gaming brochures that the casinos hand out. The real rip here is that in the last chapter Allen is hustleing an expensive ""system"" that you have to order seperatly. Look for other books on craps that go into detail about money management and winning strategy"
5,A Whizbang History of LGBT Cinema in Movie Trailers,"In response to the post from the person who was disappointed in HOMO PROMO, I just wanted to briefly explain that HOMO PROMO is a collection of original LGBT movie trailers and it really offers a very entertaining way to experience the history of LGBT representation in cinema in just over an hour of viewing time. Personally, I am a trailer fanatic. I love seeing vintage movie trailers -- they really don't make them like they used to! So, speaking as the curator of this collection, I hope you'll enjoy it for what it is! The DVD also includes a fabulous extra feature which is the short film QUEENS AT HEART (a 1965 short that gives a terrific portrait of four male-to-female transsexual women talking about there lives in New York City). Thanks!"
1,Disappointing,I was quite a fan of Paul Melancon's solo work - but this album seems rushed and incomplete. The combination of his typical dirge-like sorrowful tomes with the jangly pop mess of this new combo just doesn't work. It sounds like any other mediocre indi-college rock. What a shame.
4,Lots of info on Al MacInnis,"I think this book has a lot of great info on one of the greatest players to ever play defense-Al MacInnis. This book has information on his scoring, his defense, and has a lot of great tips for young players!"
1,Does. Not. Work.,"This is a universal diffuser that slides over your dryer. It did not come even close to staying on and flew off faster if you turned the dryer on. Plus, the sellers shipping is so high there is no point in trying to return it. Do not waste your money"
1,Don't Bother,This junk falls off the dryer during use and my wife hates it.I even used duct tape to try and keep it on but it still slid off the end.More bother than its worth.
1,doesn't fit/not standard,"I bought this for a CONAIR hair dryer. You'd think that would be a fit, right? Nope. It is anything but universal and slips right off the end. I do not recommend at all."
1,junk...dont spend the $,i thought that this would work for my blow dryer but it did not stay on it and came w/o any directions how to use it. i had to unscrew all the screws and take off the rubber band in the center to get it to stay on my hair dryer. its CRAP!!!!
2,Good while it lasted...,"This diffuser worked great. You had to set it on the counter and push your hair dryer in, in order for it to fit your dryer. But after 5 months, it only lasted 2 minutes and then popped off my dryer. I cleaned it with rubbing alcohol and my dryer too as the lady at the beauty store suggested but it didn't help. In the trash it goes."
4,Nice product,Nice product but unfortunately it didn't fit my hair dryer. It did however fit my friends' so all was not lost. I would recommend this diffuser as it was very sturdy and seemed appropriate for the correct hair dryer.
1,pulls hair,"This fits my hair dryer but my hair keeps getting caught in the space where the 2 parts connect (the bowl part clips into the rest of the unit). I thought it was my imagination, but it keeps happening, and then it ruins the curls that get caught and tangled in the diffuser, turning them into frizz. And then sometimes the bowl part just falls out when I'm using the diffuser. So it doesn't work for me."
1,Didn't fit!,This wouldn't fit my hairdryer. I have a Conair and I thought it would work but it doesn't attach :(
1,DIffuser does not fit even though it's pictured with my hair dryer!,"On Amazon, this diffuser is shown as purchased with my hair dryer, the Conair Ionshine 1875, but don't be fooled! It doesn't fit, and the company, Cosmetic Solutions will not pay for shipping back since the description says it fits ""MOST"" hair dryers. This is disappointing as it will cost more than the price of the diffuser to ship back, so I'll probably just throw it away."
3,"Seller great, product not really suited for my blow dryer","The seller for this item was great, shipping was fast and the product arrived exactly as described.The product lists as a ""universal"" fit for blow dryers, and it definitely did fit mine. Initially, I really loved this diffuser because it worked so well, but ultimately my blow dryer (which is fairly old and runs REALLY hot) kind of started melting and warping the plastic of the diffuser. I seriously doubt this would be an issue for newer blow dryers, though. My super old Conair runs so hot that there are burn marks inside the thick plastic focus stream attachment that came with it, and the air stream coming from it was so hot you couldn't hold your hand in front of it. In the end, I just bought a new blow dryer, since this one was clearly way too hot.I'd hazard a guess that this diffuser would be an ideal purchase for anyone whose blow dryer doesn't have super strength heating abilities."
3,Don't buy... updated to it's ok,"Yes, it does what it supposed to do- when it is not popping off and hitting in you in the head or the counter, knocking stuff over, or on the floor. I am hoping it is not breakable! The only way to use this deffuser is to use 2 hands, one to hold the diffuser on and while holding the hair dryer in your hand; and it still pops off. It says universal fit?? I chose this one because it was the same brand as my hair dryer. Don't waste your money - try something else!UPDATE: After using for awhile, I have noticed that it rarely pops off. So if you can stand the initial frustration, this might work for you."
1,"If I could give it zero stars, I would","I bought this camera recently.First off, it has a ""cheap"" feel to it.Bad: The software won't install on my PC. I get error messages.Worse: The camera does not retain images.For whatever reason, all the pictures ""disappeared"" several times before I could download them.WORSE STILL: The second day, the camera WON'T TURN ON. It's Dead!Sure, it's inexpensive, small, cute etc and I had high hopes for it, but what can I say, but that you get what you pay for."
1,Avoid this poorly made product.,"Received it as a present. Had no problems with the software or drivers (other than it could be slightly better to use). Without an SD card it's pretty worthless, almost no memory. So figure that you'll need to spend as much on a memory card as you do on the camera. The picture quality is decent, low light is horrible, but that much is expected for the price. HOWEVER, after 1-2 weeks of minimal use the camera is now in a continual reboot mode where even the slightest movement causes it to power off and on over and over. This is without dropping it or damaging it in any way. Customer support is fairly useless and non-responsive. Avoid this clunker."
4,I thought it was pretty good actually,"I also had this book for two math classes and found it to be pretty good, probably one of the better text books I've had. It explained things better than my teachers did! In all fairness, I knew all the math before the calculus part so I only really read the book in an in-depth manner the last 3 or 4 chapters. Anyway, just a different opinion."
2,Is this book talking about math? Did I miss something?,"I am a college student and had the unfortunete experience to have to use this utterly useless textbook for two different courses--a finite math and a calculus course. The text is very technical and wordy, with terrible examples not explaining steps but rather using the authors 'ego-boosting' terms such as 'obvioulsy', 'of course' and 'simply' -- wrongly assuming that drawn out text taught the student something. Do not buy this book if you are looking to learn calc--there has got to be something better."
5,Great in the office....,"First saw this and the snowman one in a magazine, and was glad to find them available on Amazon.com. Between the two of them, it was a bit expensive for what you get, but they still look great. I had one on each side of my computer at work. During the actual holiday weekend, I just unplugged them, brought them home, and plugged them in to my cable box and sat them on top of the TV. Quick and easy holiday decoration....just plug into any USB slot"
5,Small Tree,"Got this for my Husbands desk at work :) He LOVES it, it changes colors and is the perfect size!!!Great quality!"
2,Poor quality plug. Not worth the money...,Looks good and performs well. But the plug is flimsy and poor quality. It feels as though it will snap any time soon. I had to be very careful when I pulled it out as it felt like it was about to snap off. The cable to plug structure needs to be stronger. I feel this is a three-four use only product.
4,Used with helmet speakers,"I bought this to use with my helmet speakers after the original wore out. It works well. The only thing I would change is the volume control wheel is a little hard to locate and use with riding gloves on. I would make the wheel a bit larger so it sticks out a little from the housing and then it would be easier to find by touch. Other than that, I would have to say it is almost perfect. The price was awesome, so it is a good value."
2,Disappointed,"The wheel that controls the volume had to be all the way to one side to get any control at all. It helped to crank the MP3 volume all the way up but it didn't do what it said it would. Agreed, it was inexpensive, but I still have a volume problem almost as bad as before I got it."
3,Average,"The connection between the headphones and the volume control doesn't seem to be too great. While adjusting the volume using the Koss Volume Control, one or both ear buds will stop working until I hit a ""sweet spot"" on the volume dial."
3,Cord is WAY too long.,"The volume control is great. But the cord is ridiculously long considering I'm also plugging in a full length set of headphones. I have to wrap up one or the other cord, which leaves a lot of bulk and makes everything hang awkwardly. Would be 5* if it were only, say, 3-4"" cord."
2,does not fully control the volume of a speaker,I used this to control the volume of a 2.1 speaker system. however it does not control it properly. The sound gets switched between speakers sometimes.. other times it just does not reduce the volume. Havent tried it with a headphone though.
3,"Works for a while, but the only thing like it for non-iPhone products","It worked quite nicely for a few months, but then the sound started cutting out.Will buy again, as it is the only product I've found to add in-line volume control to headphones for any device, not just iPhones (which I don't have or like) Also, $10 2-3 times a year is definitely worth the convenience in my mind"
3,Volume control for headphones,The volum control forces me to turn up the MP3 player all the way and the control is not that sensitive. The wire is long and combined with the wire to my headphones is very long and at times difficult to manage. The clip on hte volume control is flimsy and bends very easy. Overall it works and gives me a way to control the volume but not as sensitive as I would like.
4,Simple and effective,"Purchased this because I needed a volume attenuator for my patients with traumatic brain injury. The product is simple, efficient and adaptable to any standard 3.5mm headphone jack. Just what I needed."
3,Meh...,Nothing serious. The volume seems no different from when I control it via my phone. The only difference noted is the ability to leave my phone in my pocket. Not impressed at all.
1,How can this item even be sold to the public?,"This Koss VC20 In line Volume Control which I ordered along with a set of Koss headphones from the same seller were terrible-in my opinion! First off,the volume control ""know"" is so inset and tiny that I couln't even identify it at first for about 20 mminutes. It's difficult to ""thumbnail"" this volume control to raise and lower the volume. Also, I was unable to mute out the sound.I felt that the range of volume was inferior that it afforded me the opportunity to listen to. I DID follow instructions about where to put the sources volume (such as mid to just above middle range)."
3,Alternative by Shure,"Has anyone tried this as an alternative:Shure EAADPT-KIT Adapter Kit (Combines 1/4"" Adapter, Airline Adapter, Attachable Volume Control)I wonder if it is possible just to purchase the volume control unit separately..."
3,Decent Product,"I'm using this with a set of Cambridge Soundworks 2.1 speakers since the original volume control stopped working and they no longer sell replacements.The cable is thin, and of decent length, but it is not that robust, so I don't know how much abuse it can take.I don't know what the circuitry is in on the inside, but for my speakers, I have to have the knob at a very low setting, otherwise the sound volume gets outrageously loud. As a result, unless I have it above a certain level, I only get sound at the appropriate sound level from one channel. If I increase the volume, then both channels sound fine. So that is slightly irritating, but other than that, works well."
1,Won't get to know how good this is,"This is probably a good product however the unit I got has a short in the jack that favors the left side of my headphones. Anyone who ever had a short in their headphones will know how extremely annoying it is to have to be twisting the cord this way and that trying to find that ""sweet spot"" where the both sides work. Can't enjoy music like this.Brand new unit with a short in it..???Really??? Come on Koss."
5,Works As It Should,The product works as advertized. The adjustment wheel is fine enough that the volume can be tuned in very precisely. The wheel is recessed below the side surface of the body to avoid accidentally adjusting the volume and protect the wheel from damage. The cord is perhaps thinner than I would have expected but should be ok. The body of the device is very light plastic but seems rugged enough. If the product proves to be durable I will change my rating to a 5.... I recently updated the review to a 5 star rating. I have had no issues with this adapter.
2,Go for the RadioShack model,"I bought this to replace a similar product, which was the RadioShack inline volume control (...).I would recommend buying that product instead, with a separate extension cord if you need it. As another reviewer noted, this product does not seem to increase the volume, despite what it says on the packaging. Furthermore, when I had the volume too loud and used this to turn it down, it resulted in a huge degradation of the sound quality (the audio was very hissy and filled with static).If you need something to increase your volume level, you should look somewhere else (I don't know where myself). If you just need something to turn down the volume, I would recommend the RadioShack model. It's only a few bucks more, but it's worth it considering that it works and this product does not."
2,Good idea - okay product,"An inline volume control is a great idea - we've used Sony headphones in the past that offered this, but the headphone quality was poor. When I saw the Koss Volume control, I was happy I could get back the control, while still using my high quality 'phones.Unfortunately, the max volume with the Koss installed is diminished quite a bit. I'd say about 20% lower than regular headphones alone.Another issue is the small size of the slider - I find myself fumbling to find the slider and use it. Something with a bit more of a 'thumb switch' would be better. I understand you don't want something that can be easily bumped accidentally, but the tiny slider bar this unit currently has is just not adequate.Because there's no other options I've found for something like this, I'll stick with the Koss Volume control, but if there were other options, I'd jump in an instant!"
3,Koss VC20 Volume Control,The Koss VC20 Volume Control works very well with the Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7 QuietPoint Active Noise-Cancelling Headphones. Great combination.....
1,useless to me.,"this seems like a useless product to me, i found it searching around for a solution to increasing the volume in headphones plugged directly into an audio output (pc in this case), which these can NOT do. says right on the package ""increases volume!"" but it in fact does no such thing. it will let you adjust the volume UP TO the maximum level its already being output, aka no louder at all.so unless your pc/ipod/whatever doesn't let you scale volume DOWN, there's really no need for this product to even exist."
2,Not what I thought it was,"Basically this is a volume control on a headphone jack. Can be handy but what I was wanting was something to boost the output of the volume in my headphones. This doesn't amplify the sound, it's a volume control, headphone wire extender. If that is what you are looking for, it's a 5 star item, but I was wanting something to punch the volume up on headphones, especially ones that are rated at 32 ohms."
1,WORTHLESS FOR CLASSICAL,"I received this unit a few hours ago and after trying it out for 15 minutes I was amazed how bad this small unit is. Perhaps useful for those whose music tastes and needs are different than mine, the unit is useless if the accuracy of the musical performance is relevant to you. As a former audio engineer for many years I was surprised that a passive unit could be so bad.It's so cheap that it's not worth returning so it's going directly into the trash. Maybe I'll open it up and see what it is and run a test or two out of curiosity. No, it's not worth the time.But because it's so cheap, if you need a remote volume control and listen to crap or don't care about the sound, try it out and if you don't like it, dump it.This is the first time that I have ever given a product a bad review, but this was too horrible to ignore."
1,Wiring at jack end failed after about a dozen uses,"This was just what I wanted to use at my desk. Gave me extra length and allowed me to decrease the volume as my laptop's lowest was still too high. Unfortunately, despite very light use with no tension placed on the wiring it's a goner."
2,Worst product in its class,I bought this item to replace another headphone adapter that was broken. While I like the clip with the analog knob I cannot recommend this product. Upon my first use I noticed that maximum volume using this product is much lower than without using it. That means you will burn down your battery that much quicker because you will have to set the volume that much higher on your device to listen at the same level. I placed a phone call using a headset that was plugged into my phone and the person on the other end couldn't hear me at all. I removed this device and the person could hear me fine. I am going back to the iLuv iEA15BLK iPod Remote that I owned previously.
4,"Good control, but access to the wheel could be better","Good quality, no impact on audio quality.The wheel is small and recessed. Maybe it was designed like this to prevent inadvertent movement if the device is in a pocket, etc. But it kinda defeats the purpose of having an inline control if you're gonna stick it in your pocket. Anyway, the a larger wheel or more open access would be an improvement."
3,Works but only controls volume,I bought a set of noise cancelling headphones for a trip and want to use these to control the volume.Haven't gone on the trip yet but have used the volume control and headphones severaltimes.One thing to note. This is a volume control switch not a sound booster. I was surprised this did not boost the signal. However it its advertised as volume control which is what it does and is very handy.I did notice the drop in sound when this is being used. Its not as crisp and sounds a bit more muted. However over all it works for what I need it for.RR
2,Had to modify,"This is a poor design made for very, very light application.I had to modify the unit with a heavier cable due to the internal wires either not making contact or shorting out."
4,Convenient but pricey,"I just needed an extension cable for my Sony headphones that had very short wire length (they connect to my cell phone's hands free cable and that's why they have been made that way), but most of the extensions available are at least 3ft in length. This Koss VC20 was perfect and I also got the added convenience of a volume control. However, at $8.99 (what I paid at the time) they are pricey for what they do. These days you can pretty much buy a cassette/CD walkman for that price!Nevertheless, I am happy with my purchase."
3,It works but could be a lot better,"I bought this because it does the job at a cheap price. I ride a motorcycle and I needed to be able to control the volume at stops and when I want to talk to other riders. Digging a phone out of your pocket to find the volume just didn't work. I would like someone to put out a product to do the same thing this product does but do it better. Rough duty wiring, Put a pass through T on the in and out wiring end so the input and out put are together at the music device location. Put the volume knob on the other end so you have just one cord and a clip at your lapel that holds the device in a position that is easily accessible. With this unit there are two cables, one in one out at the clip on location. the cables get all messed up and are not very handy, but it works for the price."
4,works fine; I'm not sure I needed it.,The volume control was offered as an add-on with the headphones. It makes the cord longer and I don't have to fiddle with the laptop's volume control. It's useful but not one of life's necessities.
3,Lasted a while,"These things are always temporary. Fortunately my new receiver has a better earphone output, complete with volume control on the TV remote, so I don't need to replace this in-line volume control.Nothing wrong with the product, but it wasn't sturdy enough to really last - and nothing else I've tried was either. The designers apparently have never lived with their own products. If they listen to music or TV at all they probably don't use earphones.Review by Tony. We both use Plant Lady's Amazon account these days. She has never used earphones and knows nothing about the highly technical science of running them off a TV set."
3,Koss VC20 Volume control...,"The view shows a 90 degree jack but the actual product is a normal straight on jack. The normal straight on jack will have stress on it. I bought this because my RCA HDTV has a headphone buzz, probably due to proximity to the the light source. If I had it to do over again I would get an LED HDTV back light. Much less chance of buzzing."
3,Works but cheap construction,Worked just fine but someone stepped on it and it easily broke. I may get another one though. It is very inexpense.
3,Decent for slightly controlling volume,"I bought this in order to inexpensively kill the AGC of my video capture card. When the volume was lowered closer to where it was barely audible, there was lots of crackling and distortion. Upon examining its audio waveform at the lower settings, the negative phase of both channels was becoming increasingly truncated/clipped. Depending on what it's connected to, it's good for slightly controlling the volume; however, look into using an amp, instead, for maximum volume control."
3,They work as advertised.,I purchased this product because the output jack I wanted to use for my headphones has no volume control. This product solved that problem.
3,It works ok...,"This volume control works ok, but the cord is only 2 feet in length and the volume control dial is set in a cut out that isn't so easy to operate."
4,Excelent,"for my use it's perfect. I just have my speaker set to the max volume (because its broken) and i control my volume with this, i love it although that shipping thing threw me off. $13 ... -.- would have liked to know from the start thank you very much."
2,Fair product,I bought this volume control to replace a much more expensive Shure EA650 Volume Control one which I lost. Sorry I just didn't buy another Shure The Shure was much easier to use and better quality.
4,Does What It's Supposed To,"The volume control does allow me to set the volume lower than my MP3 player lets me do on my own. My only problem is that I'm not crazy about the extra cord length and bulk. (Between the extra cord that is folded and twist-tied and the actual volume control switch, the cord gets a little annoying)."
4,Works fine - good for the money,"This product does what it is supposed to do. I've occasionally noticed that the connection isn't perfect, but mine's been banged around a lot and dragged on the floor of my study. I've always been able to get rid of any connection problems by just ensuring that the my phones are plugged in tight. This product comes in handy."
2,worked great...for a day,"I purchased this based on the recommendation from Amazon about what a great add-on this product is. It was great - the one time it worked. Unfortunately, I needed to leave the country (on vacation) so I didn't get a chance to return it the time limit. I'm glad it was less than $10 but I guess I got what I paid for. Maybe I got a reject from the factory because the other customer reviews were good."
1,Did Not Work,This product did not work. I'm a little hard of hearing and the Koss volume control did not alter the volume any different from the DVD player I was using. A waste of money.I purchased a full headset with volume control which did a much better job altering the volume over and above the original player.
3,Koss VC20 Volume Control,The Koss VC20 Volume Control was purchased to be used with a smaller TV that is in the bedroom. I found that it did not turn the volume up loud enough to hear comfortably even at the highest setting. I am not using this control.
4,Length too short,"I just purchased this to be able to use it as an extension for my office. The wire of koss spark plug is just about enough for me... a little move and the wire stretches because of which I spoiled one spark plug before... This was the reason, why I bought this as an entension + volume control. I realized, this just satisfies the volume control part and that it does very well without creating a lot of distortion. I haven't tried it with anything other than spark plug though.... The only reason it doesn't get 5 starts, is because its length is too short... which did not satisfy my needs..."
2,Doesn't do what package says,"I bought this item to help boost the volume just a little for my Zune 30. The MS Zune ipod is a great little thing but just doesnt have the volume needed to watch some low volume videos. Ten years ago I loved my Koss volume control with my sony cassette walkman, it made everything Super loud. The new one on the package it says ""makes volume louder"" but I cannot make it boost any sound on my Zune or Sony CD walkman, tried with both earbud and over ear phones and the result is always just a slight volume loss (between max with and without device). after purchase I broke down and bought the E5 headphone amp that cost only a little more.If you need any extra volume this is not the device for you. This is perfect if you want an inline volume or extra length."
2,Do not buy,"This product is simple in design, however somehow it still sucks. I have owned items like this in the past and never had such a time with them. I plugged everything in, and it worked great, untill I moved, and it began to crackle non-stop. Once I adjusted the volume the slightest bit the music went out all together, if it is not on full volume it is muted."
1,Does not turn sound up; only turns sound down,"I have discovered, as have others, that most modern TVs do not have a simple output jack for headphones. Instead they have a limited volume output set of jacks. The sound coming out of them is set pretty low and you cannot increase it using your remote's volume controls (I guess the manufacturers figure you are going to hook it up to an amp and a theatre sound system, which is not what I wanted to do.) So I heard about this product and it seemed like just the thing I needed to boost volume. Wrong. It has no power source, so if you set the dial on the unit at maximum volume, it comes to your headphones at exactly the same weak strength as emanates from the TV output jacks. All it can do in reality is turn the sound down. Skip it."
4,"Handy Gadget, 3 Easy questions to make your decision.","I purchased this item with a new pair of headphones for my wife and I to use with our laptop. The Koss volume control does exactly what it's supposed to and is a handy convenience to adjust volume quickly and easily. I didn't notice any signal degradation as a result of having the volume control plugged in-line with the headphones. If you need a little extra cord length then that would be an added benefit. My wife absolutely loves the convenience but I've concluded I could just as easily live without it.Should you buy it? Just answer three questions and you'll have your final answer. 1) Would you prefer a little extra cord length? 2) In everyday headphone use, do you find yourself frequently adjusting the volume? 3) Do you have the extra cash to burn?My wife answered yes to all three while I answered no. Did we keep it? You know what they say, happy wife, happy life. :)"
1,Clarity Eliminator,"Koss should change the name of this unit to the Clarity Eliminator. That is exactly what it does when you try to turn the volume down. All the clarity / treble disappears leaving a barely understandable muffled sound. I tried it with brand new Koss UR40 headphones plugged into the tape monitor jack on a TDK dual tape deck. By themselves, the headphones have only fair quality and are way too loud. Add the VC20 and the muffled sound makes the headphones with volume control TOTALLY USELESS. If you need a volume control for headphones DO NOT BUY THIS ONE. Either buy some other one or buy headphones with a volume control, such as the Koss UR29."
3,"Convenient, but...","It's definately a nice item to have... at first. I got mine so that I could use it with my computer, and be able to change the sound level without going through menus and unplug the headphones easily without having to crawl behing the computer, so that I could use them with my stereo. It worked great for about 3 months, however, it's wearing out - the headphone port has broken loose in the casing, and I have to fidget with it for a minute to get the plug all the way in (otherwise, sound only comes out one side). Due to the way it's constructed, the dial for the volume will keep it from getting any worse, so I'll still be able to use it, but it sure is annoying when I'm trying to move between things."
1,Reduces Bass,This volume control dramatically reduced to amount of bass that goes through it. I tried it with multiple systems and each one of them sounded better without the volume control.
3,"Snap, Crackle, Pop","This product has been mediocre since the beginning. When adjusting the volume control, the balance alternately shifts between favoring the right and left channels in an unpredictable manner. After just a couple of months of use, there is a great deal of static and crackling when changing the volume. Sometimes rapidly turning the dial from MIN to MAX several times alleviates the problem for a few hours. This product is good if you're looking for an inexpensive, throw-away solution."
4,works great,"Nice to have extra capacity over the standard reservoir. It is slightly large and bulkly, but I guess that the whole point."
4,Senseo extra large reservoir,This product is performing very well. The only criticism is that it's a bit cumbersome to remove and replace into the coffee machine. It gave new life to my original Senseo which I was about to replace when I tried this instead. Love it!
2,Senseo Extra Large Reservoir,"I suppose it could just be faulty and I should send it back, but I have decided that by the time I've payed the shipping costs again that it would not be cost effective. The problem is that if you fill it up over the two cup line, the water leaks out -ALL OVER YOUR COUNTER. Twice I found the machine sitting in a massive pool of water. I never fill it up more than half way and I always empty it as soon as I am done. And yes, it does defeat the purpose."

2,Not Quite,"I was no fan of campy 60's sitcoms. However, the late Elizabeth Montgomery infused the character of Samantha Stevens with an unique charm all her own. While Nicole Kidman is an all around better actress, she doesn't possess that quirkiness that made Bewitched a TV hit in the 60's.I liked the movie's novel premise but maybe it should have been a bit more serious in tone. It could have been a scathing commentary on the fickleness of Hollywood.Most of the casting was excellent. There was something lacking in the pacing of the movie. It seemed to drag in spots at times."
2,Not A Great Remake,"Okay, I LOVE NICOLE KIDMAN and I believe had the plot been better, she would've made the perfect Samantha. In fact, I'd like to see them cast her in a television role of Samantha!But the plot and Darrin...well, let's just say I was not pleased! Even my kids hated the show. Sure, there were a few cute moments, but the plot was weak and the attempts to make it funny were overdone."
5,Great Fun!,"This is not a remake of the tv show, but cleverly weaves part of the story into a new twist on a young witch that falls for a mortal that is involved in remaking the tv show. Nicole, Will, Michael and Shirley are great! I highly recommend it!"
1,horrible.,"I wish i could give this a negitive ten stars. It is a disgrace. It has nothing to do with the old show. If you are going to remake the old show, then do it. Don't turn it into something ... god awful."
3,Cute idea...but at times stupid...but will ferrel/and micheal cain make it funny,"The first 40 minutes it was horrible...then finally it picked up when Will Ferrel did those voices at the table and thats when it got funny...Nicole Kidman may look like Samatha from the show but she is not like her at all shes not funny but she is hot...Micheal Cain was funny as well...other then that it wasnt that good...The show is much much better. Nicole Kidman, Kristin Chenoweth, and Heather Burns are hot."
2,Calling Mystery Science Theater 3000!,"I agree with the reviewer that said the only way to watch this movie again would be if it were given the MST3K treatment.Joel and Mike and the bots were pros at turning a lemon into lemonade. This movie fails on several levels, as romantic comedy, fantasy, or even as tribute to the original series. Worst of all is the Norah Ephron script. Nicole Kidman as the witch Isabel is a ditz who speaks in a Marilyn Monroe, 'happy birthday Mr. president' cadence. Why she desires to live a normal human life isn't explained. Her fascination and awe with simple every day mortal things like turning on a lawn sprinkler or opening a can of soda seems bizarre, as she has no problems using a credit card or driving a car. She has no chemistry with her costar Will Ferrell who's poor performance is also partly the fault of the poorly written script. Did Nora Ephron even like the original series?"
2,Bewitched has been bestunk,"will ferell is pretty funny in this movie, but the whole idea was stupid, they shoul've made a movie based on the show not the way they did it. I agree that it's a new take but in my oppinion it didn't fly very well. and they made nicole kidmans character to stupid. well thats all."
3,It's nothing special but Nicole Kidman is great as always.,"I really liked the first 45 minutes of Bewitched but after that the film unfortanely falls flat. Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrel are surprisely great together, but their chemistry could not save this film. The director Nora Ephron direction was lousy and annoying at times, especially the part where the film actually rewinds itself halfway through. The premise of the film was not very creative, they should have just stuck with how the t.v. show version was. Why try to change a classic t.v. show, it doesn't make any sense to me. If you like Kidman then go ahead and rent it but otherwise than that, you should probably avoid this so-called bewitching romantic comedy."
3,"Nicole Kidman = 5 stars, but BEWITCHED is a 2","My wife and I grow more and more impressed everytime we see Nicole Kidman and her widening range of acting ability.She seems to be doing at least 4 movies per year now ranging from comedy to tragedy...In our minds she has far surpassed her ex-husband (Tom Cruise) in the talent and acting department.Does she ever have time to have a homelife anymore with all the films she is doing ??But in BEWITCHED, Nicole is the only thing worth watching.... the remainder of the film is a total ZERO and a pain to watch.I had heard of Will Ferrell but never seen anything of his before now.... Ugghh... the guy is not funny.BEWITCHED the movie is a ZERO, Nicole Kidman is a FIVE.... bringing this movie experience to an average of 2.5"
2,Not well made...disgrace to the sitcom...,Bewitched is a movie that seemed like it may be a good movie. I usually put off movies if reviews are bad but this one looked like maybe since it wasn't hyped so much it would be the surprise hit of the summer. I was wrong. This movie was not funny. I love Will Ferrell but he is just annoying in this part. Whiny and self absorbed. Also the plot is full of wholes and characters pop up into the plot for no real reason except to have another character. The part that actually got good was towards the end. If they would have cut out half the movie at the beginning and started from the end this movie may have worked but since they didn't the movie also didn't work. I did like the innocent jokes that Nicole Kidman had but even after a while the boredom had taken over and it was hard to even muster a laugh. My advise if you want to see this movie wait until it is on video and then wait until it goes to cheap rentals.
4,I liked it.....A lot.,"I've heard how terrible this movie is and I have to disagree. I thought it was very entertaining. Will Ferrell and Nicole Kidman were very good. There were more than one ""laugh out loud"" moments (like the scene when Samantha puts the spell on Darin while he's asking for his dog back!) LOL that was great.Great music which includes Sinatra, Louis Armstrong, Steve Lawrence and Ella Fitzgerald.I'm not saying this movie will sweep the 2005 Oscars or anything nor was it ever meant to. I'm glad I went to see it. I liked it far more than I ever expected."
3,Keep an open mind when you watch it.,"I personaly am a big fan of both Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell. They play their characters very well. They could not find better actors for the film. The story line is not bad, but it is not eactly like the show. If you are they type of person who wants to see something that pertains to the show COMPLETELY, then I suggest you don't watch it. Watch it with an open mind, and you may like it. I can promise you will like the actors... maybe not so much the directing..."
4,fluff,"This is mild fluff comedy. But if you are a fan of the show, you might enjoy it quite a bit. Nicole and Shirley have great resemblances to their characters. Unlikely plotline, but hey, so was the tv show."
5,A must have addition..,"If you're a Bewitched fan, this movie is a must have for your collection. Really entertaining and it just seems to gets you ""hooked"" or should we say, places a spell on you to watch it again.LOL- enjoy."
1,Is there lower than 1 star,"Seldom do I watch movies where it is so unbelievably bad that I sit there with my mouth open in disbelief throughout the whole thing. But this is the one. The script is nearly non-existent, the direction is inept, and Kidman and Ferrell overact so badly one hopes both of them stay away from comedy for a very, very long time. While trying to be a sweet romantic comedy, the amount of unfunny improvisation from Ferrell and the over-the top acting make this movie into an amateur night at the community theatre. Ephron was trying to skewer the industry, but misguided attempts at humor and the horrible script makes this movie more of an industry joke than commentary on the industry itself. I'm surprised this movie actually got a theatrical release."
1,A flop!,"Bewitched was my all time favorite TV show when i was growing up and in high school. Again, outside of Shirley as Endora, the story, cast and everything else was very disappointing. Why does Hollywood think that they can improve on the classics? Out of all the years this show ran couldn't they have been somewhat or at least a little creative? This is an extremely poor film and whoever told Nicole she could act? I've seen this poor girl in all kinds of films and she is still a lozy actress. Don't you think by now that someone would have told her? Don't waste you money on this one folks especially if you in my generation of the 50's/60's. Of course kids of today who don't know what good acting is because of special effects might like this film somewhat. This is the first time i wish i could get my money back."
2,"Poor Acting, Thin story","As a true fan of the original TV show Bewitched I hoped for something entertaining and enjoyable. Will Ferrell is, as usual, a crappy actor. Nicole Kidman's character is extremely naive and childish for someone who is supposed to be centuries old. It was a silly boy meets girl movie, that I'm glad I did not pay to see at the theatre."
3,Elizabeth Montgomery is probably rolling in her grave...,"I wanted to see this film only because I am such a huge fan of the TV series that it is based on. If the TV series had never been, then this would have been a good film. However, because the TV series DOES exist, this film is a disgrace. This film totally destroys the spirit of the original series. The only character that was given proper respect was that of Endora. As I said before, if this was a film independent of a TV series, it would be a good film. However, in the light of the series so many of us know and love, it is a failed attempt to bring the Bewitched franchise into the current era. Agnes Moorehead is the only actor that may have been given proper respect with this film. Elizabeth Montgomery, Dick York, Dick Sergeant, and the various others are probably all rolling around in their graves by this point. I give this movie 3 Stars ONLY because of the name it carries and the heritage it attempts to emulate."
1,"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered am I",It starts off strong and then dwindles into boredom. Nicole Kidman and Michael Caine rise above the poorly written script. I am not a Will Farrell fan. I find him annoyingly stupid . . . and this movie is no exception. I think Will Farrell is an acquired taste like Benny Hill . . . and obviously I haven't acquired it. I am not sure why they picked him as Darren . . . He is a weird choice . . . I think Jim Carey would have made more sense. I say check this movie out even though it is terrible. It is so strange you have to see it to believe it. The whole real witch being cast in a remake of Bewitched was an interesting idea . . . just poorly done. Shirely MacLaine is such a great actress . . . why didn't they give her any lines . . . she was barely in the movie and she was playing Andora?!?!?!?
3,I expected it to be different,"Having been a fan of bewtiched when I was little, this came as a bit of a disappointment. I had hoped for a re-make of the series but this wasn't so. The story was not what I had expected and after going through half the movie feeling disappointed I managed to enjoy the remaining of it!"
2,Bewitched -- the movie,Will Ferrell should not have been chosen to play the leading actor for this movie. Nicole Kidman did a much better job than he did. The TV series was much better.
2,Save your ticket money and buy the Series on DVD!,"UGH! The only good thing about the movie - is the uncanny portrayal of Nicole Kidman as Samantha - everything else - in the ""re-tooling"" of Bewitched is confusing and hodge podge! The simple fact that Uncle Arthur was not real in the movie was a disservice to the series!The DVD series one - color version - came with a free movie ticket. If you have more time than sense, by all means - take adavantage of the free ticket. Or give to someone - and go home and watch the DVDS... much better investment of time!!!"
3,It Just Didn't Work For Me,"I thought this would be a fun little film to watch. It wasn't terrible, but it didn't interest me any more than television would have.The plot didn't work. I would rather have gone to a remake of the original series or else a behind the scenes true life of how the original came to be. But this combination of behind the scenes look with the campy witchcraft, just didn't work for me.The characters didn't work. Are we to believe that such lady as this will fall for a guy like that? This pairing was even more unbelievable than the plot.The one thing that did work was the companion dvd that contained the first three episodes of the first season. Now THAT was a good bonus.We watched this dvd as a family. I kept finding reasons to go to the kitchen for a snack. My wife fell asleep. But my daughter liked it."
2,Boring,"I used to watch Bewitched on box set with my mother because it's her favorite show,so when a remake of bewitched cameI said it should be good. I didn't reallylike it, it was boring, the stortyline bad, and its sad because it has two great actors."
5,Bewitched dvd,"It is a fun family movie which we can enjoy and not have to worry that there will be profanity, violence, crude remarks or nudity."
4,review,good product and good price. I will not fill out one of these reviews again. To expect a certain quantity of words is stupid. Pur your own words in!!
1,They forgot to make a movie.,"Classic example of phoning it in for a paycheck.Nicole Kidmanshould be ashamed.Will Farrell going through the motions.ShirleyMaclaine and Michael Caine looked bored.The writing was weak,blandand terribly unfunny.I was amazed how bad this was even given thepoor reviews.Where was the wit?The insulting humor with the touchof meanness?The zany characters and absurd situations?ABSENT!!!Kidmans' character even kills Farrells' movie wife before she turnsback time.What were they thinking?This was a movie made to make afast buck, not a movie made to delight.My 13 year old niece enjoyed it though."
1,God awful.,"I knew this would be bad going in, but not this bad. I laughed once in 90 minutes - pretty sad. The rest of the time, I squirmed in agony from the truly dreadful plot, the bad writing, and the uninspired acting. Just a mess of a movie that should have been scrapped and entirely reworked. Who green lights this stuff? Did someone think this was worth producing? A talented cast is utterly wasted in perhaps the year's worst movie."
1,Very disappointing,"I guess it will depend on what you want from this film. The breezy feeling that I always got while watching the TV series did not happen, even though it was nice to hear the theme music. I have always been a fan of Nora Ephron, and I can't imagine what happened here. I think there was a lot a careful calculation going into the TV show. Everything was fine tuned into something that seemed weightless and ethereal. When Samantha served Darrin a cocktail after his long days at work you could almost feel the weight shift off of your shoulders. There was a summery feeling to the series, and even though I think Ephron was searching for a way to connect into that somehow, she got lost in a maze of possibilities that didn't pan out. I got the feeling that she never actually looked forward to the show every week, that she never sat in a dimly lit living room somewhere waiting to be transported for 30 minutes. I just wish she had left it for someone who had."
2,Has moments to shine but not enough to make this a good movie,I have watched a few bewitched tv episodes and it was ok butr the movie should not be called bewitched. The movie they are just making a remkae of the series. The movie has odd funny moments but not enough to make the movie good. The acting is good but the ending sucked it did not really tell us that much that we wanted to konw. The movie was not horriblr as I thlight it was going to be ut it's not good.
5,Underrated,"I didn't know anything at all about this movie when we rented it. I expected the usual retreat of an old favorite. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised by a fresh take on the old-TV-show-converted-to-movie genre. ""Bewitched"" is a movie about people making a movie from an old TV show. And it succeeds. Nora Ephron is on top of her game, writing a great script and directing with style. And having great improvisational comedians like Will Farrell and Steve Carell in the cast adds another dimension to the movie as well. I laughed a lot, and really enjoyed the film.Give this a shot as a rental, at least."
1,"Bad Casting, Bad Idea","After a Brilliant TV series, this film is an abomination.If they took the original formula and stuck with that, AND excluded Nicole Kidman, this might have been a watch... but, it's trash.Essentially every positive feature of the original series is thrown out the door; updated, oh my stars ... not a good version of a magnificent series.Avoid at all costs... as you should almost anything with Kidman."
2,What sixth grader dreamed up this plot?,"I don't want to insult sixth graders, but this movie was strictly grade school stuff. Not only did it not pay homage to the TV series, it seemed like an insult to it. Characters were not funny or likable. This film was boring and predictable. I gave it 2 stars because I made it through the whole thing although I'm not sure how."
1,An Unfortunate Embarrassment for Everyone Involved,"Hands down, one of the WORST movies of 2005. Perhaps of all time. And to add insult to injury, it's supposedly an ""homage"" to the witty, sexy, timeless sitcom of the same name. Definitely one of those ""What the heck were they thinking!?"" projects that was not worth the wait. But the first seasons of the Elizabeth Montgomery series instead and don't waste your money here---or encourage the industry to do more of these unfunny, insipid ""update/remakes"" of classic TV series. Poor Nicole Kidman, Carole Shelley, Kristen Chenowith and Shirley MacLaine. And Poor Audience!Fans of the original series will be (or SHOULD be!) disappointed and disgruntled. Anyone else will simply scratch their head and wonder, ""Huh!??"""
1,Waste of talent,This is a good example of wasted talent. Either Hollywood is running out of ideas or this was someone's sick and twisted tax deduction loss. The writers could have come up with a better story by looking at actual past episodes. Will's acting is getting a little old now. His characters are too similar to his previous work.
1,Bewitched sucked!,"That movie is the biggest waste of film I have been to in a very long time. IT was boring, hardly kept me awake. I will never go to a will farrel movie. He really stunk it up. I would love to have the seven bucks I wasted on that piece of trash. Will would do better driving a ice cream truck than trying wayyyy to hard to be funny. I would buy a cone as long as he didnt try to be clever or cute or funny since he cant pull off any of the above!"
1,So Awful!,"This movie was so horrible I fell asleep for a bit while watching. I used to love watching reruns of this in the eighties as a little girl. I was so delighted there was going to be a movie. This movie was something trying to masquerade as ""bewitched"" It sucked. Did Nicole Kidman read the script before she signed on the dotted line? Will Ferrel was terrible, he was so bad. They should be ashamed of this movie. It was not funny! I didn't laugh once. The romance they tried to create didn't work! Kidman and Ferrell=no chemistry. It's been a while since I've seen a movie this bad, honestly. I was embarassed for these actors who are some of the best Michael Caine for one. This is one of the worse movie scripts and remakes I've seen."
2,Bewitched,I found parts of the movie mildly entertaining. I actually found the free original episodes that came with it more worth the money spent. I was totally appalled at the comment about Hepatitis C. If someone had any other life threatening disease would it have been made light of in a movie of this caliber? I think not.I was left totally disillusioned and disappointed and very glad I didn't let my grand-children watch this obviously prejudiced movie.
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Anybody who knows the original TV series to any length will be able to see how the whole industry can't hold a candle to what it once was (just as proven by the Beverly Hillbillies and other such movies - do you really believe there's an actor on the planet today that can hold a candle to Irene Ryan?). Why anybody likes Will Ferrell in the first place is beyond me. He's a baboon faced Jim Carrey wannabe with a 5 year old brain. Kidman is as cute as always, but come on - if you think any of these actors even come close to having the skills of Montgomery and the rest, you're a moron. Have you seen the original Uncle Arthur, Aunt Clara, Gladys Kravitz, etc?. ""probally the most Romantic Comedy I have seen""??? Your critique is equivalent to your grammar. All that consider this romantic please stay away from us folks in the real world."
1,"oh, blah!","This movie really tanked, sorry to say. Nicole Kidman was terrific in her role, but the script was lousy, there was nothing funny about it, and everyone left the theater feeling let-down. The only good thing about this film was the cute house they had Nicole's character living in; I kept staring at the architecture and the decor. I spent most of my time during the film wishing I could live in a cute little cottage like hers. But the movie itself was just plain awful. When is Hollywood going to get it? It's all about the script, folks!"
5,Bewitching...,"I really enjoyed this charming comedy...very bewitching. Nicole Kidman and Will Farrell work very well together, creating a perfect element of comedy and light hearted fun! I really don't understand all of the negative reviews this movie has seemed to attract...I think most of it is due to the fact that most people walk in expecting one type of movie, and walk out having seen another! I went in with no expectations and was able to watch this movie with an open mind, and I have totally fallen in love with this movie! If you are a fan of the original TV series, as I am, you will love this movie which gives nod to the original...and you will see Elizabeth Montgomery quite often. Give this movie a shot and I am sure you will be...Bewitched!"
3,This vs tv series,This was okay but I would rather see the old television series. I really wanted to see this but was rather let down.I would rent this but not buy.
2,Ewwww,"Bewitched is not funny. Kidman is annoying and Ferrel is misscast. His Darren isnt funny at all because it relies on 50s humor. The plot is as thin as paper and the spin of actor playing actors playing the characters isnt genious. Carell is great though, the only shining star in the movie."
1,Stay Away...,Under no circumstances submit yourself to this abomination of a movie. You can actually feel your IQ drop as the movie progresses (the same effect was also detected when watching an episode of The Anna Nicole Smith Show). The only way i'd ever watch this again is if Mystery Science Theater 3000 came out of retirement. You've been warned...
1,A Classic TV Series Ruined,"I've never been a big fan of TV shows turned into movies. I can't think of one that was any good; However, I had high hopes for one of my favorite classic TV shows in the hands of Nora Ephron. Wow, was I disappointed! In the special features Ephron talks about how the movie would have failed if they simply remade the TV show, and maybe she's right, but what she created was downright terrible. The normally great Nicole Kidman was horrible and not even the usually funny Will Ferrell could save this bad movie. The entire plot is silly. If you liked the classic TV show, don't rent this movie."
1,Complete disgrace! SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"I'm a huge fan of the original TV series. This trash in no way, shape or form has any resemblance to the TV classic. NONE! It looks like the script was written by a high school freshman. It's amazing that this was put out by a studio. They should be ashamed. Do yourself a favor and skip this garbage."
4,I enjoyed it,"I enjoyed this movie. I saw it in the movie theatre though and it was one of those few days where I get off to the movies and leave my hubby at home with all the kids. Since I tend to be happy anytime I'm having a moment to myself my opinion of the movie could have been skewed by the mere pleasantry of having a moment alone!! Having said that, I saw the tv series and knew going in this was not an exact remake. I thought it was very cute and enjoyable to watch. It even made me almost like Nicole Kidman who up until now was not a favorite actress of mine. I thought she was very enjoyable in this movie and I found it to be a lot of fun. Not the funniest movie I've ever seen but I'm pretty hard on comedies. They are my favorite genre and I like them to be laugh out loud funny. I don't give 5 stars to any movie unless it's got me rolling in the aisles."
1,Don't bother,"this movie is horrible! I bet all of those in it hope it disappears. Nicole Kidman is good in it but the overall story is very boring, this is a waste of money and time, don't bother."
1,WHY?!?!?,"That's the question surrounding this movie. Why does Will Ferrell, who was king of over the top comedy after 'Old School', continue to do PG and PG-13 movies. He's not funny unless he is out of control, and he can't let loose in a non-R rated movie.Why would they greenlight such a completely lame script. Nicole Kidman plays Isabel, who catches actor Jack Wyatt (Ferrell)'s eye and she wants her to play Samantha on a remake of Bewitched. Isabel is a witch in real life, however. This just makes the movie play out in an inane and genuinely stupid fashion. To boot, it wasn't even really funny. I could read the back of the 'Old School' DVD case and laugh more times than I did during this movie. It is a complete snooze-fest.The Final Word - Bewitched wasn't funny or intelligent or even entertaining. I wanted to kick my own ass for seeing it. Not recommended to anyone under any circumstances."
2,What Were They Thinking???,"I watched this movie at the theaters when it came out. Being a fan of the Bewitched series, I went with a friend who begged me to go see this ""remake?"". What a letdown. First of all, Nicole Kidman as Samantha???? Bad Choice!!! That was almost an insult to Bewitched fans. She was so unconvincing as Samantha. As far as Will Ferrell, I hated his performance in this movie, not that I enjoy any of his performances. This movie was actually boring and not funny at all. It's the kind of movie that makes you want to leave the theater. I don't know what they were thinking when they made this film, but they surely were not thinking right. This is one movie that I will not be watching again. You expect a great movie and end up with a terrible one!!"
1,DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT,"THIS MOVIE IS SO BAD ITS PAINFUL! Honestly, I dont know what nicole kidman was thinking. Its really horrible. Dont waste your time"
2,Kidman is NO Montgomery!,"I gave this upcoming flick two stars rather than one or none because it appears to have a decent director and Shirley Maclaine will probably be excellent in the Endora(esqe) role ... and of course I haven't seen it yet. However, to cast Nicole Kidman in a role based on that created by the magnificent Elizabeth Montgomery is utterly ridiculous. Nicole is an over-rated, mediocre actress who isn't capable of offering the charm and depth to the character that Montgomery did in the original.Yes, I am a huge Elizabeth Montgomery fan and it would be nearly impossible to live up to her legend in my opinion, but Kidman is far from the answer for me. If the powers-that-be had cared more about the ""art"" of the project and less about having a box-office hit, they might have chosen a better route and used an unknown actress to play the part!"
1,"Bedeviled, yes ... Bewitched, never!","What a huge disappointment! We watched this film as a family and not one of us liked it including my daughters who are fifteen and nine. This film banked on the success of the TV sitcom and threw in a few big name actors. The storyline was weak, the script was bad and the acting??? Michael Caine was the only redeeming quality and therefore is entitled to the one star I gave it. Even Shirley MacLaine seemed to act as though her name alone could carry her. If you're a fan of Elizabeth Montgomery's Bewitched don't bother with this one."
2,"""Bewitched"" leaves one bothered and bewildered . . .","Going into the movie, you think one of two things: ""I hope it will be different from the original"" or ""I hope it will be similar to the original"". In the strangest of ways, neither viewpoint is disappointed.During the beginning of the film, one can see the potential differences. There is a new vibe, which I found refreshing. But halfway through the film, Bewitched's spell is broken, leaving audience members scratching their heads. All originality disappears, and by the end it's Samantha and Darin all over again, complete with house, neighbour, and basic plot.It seems this movie is lacking two major elements: a strong storyline, and believable characters. The acting is rather good; however, and Kidman's nose twitch is spot on."
2,HORRIBLE,"This movie is horrible and boring,the plot is confusing and far fetched. It is hard to make any sense of this movie"
1,IN ALL MY STARS! WHAT A TERRIBLE MOVIE!!!,"I loved the TV series, and I think Elizabeth Montgomery would turn in her grave, this movie is so bad! This is Nicole Kidman at her most hateful. That stupid little voice she put on. If this were the first movie I've ever seen with her in it, I would never watch another movie with her in it. Will Farrell was just as hateful.The idea was good that they were going to do a remake of the series in the movie, but the writing was so bad. Another movie that is an insult to human kind. Hollywood must think we are really stupid to fall for this movie. It could be that little kids will like it, but for an adult, no way! I don't think I can watch a Nicole Kidman movie after this. I have no respect for her work after this.I was very dissapointed in this movie. The TV series was so wonderful!"
3,NOT BAD!!!!,"For a nonsensical movie like this, it's not bad!At first, I thought I give it 2 stars.Here are some facts about this movie:#1. I give this movie 3 stars because it is comical in some parts, but not all.#2. I agree with the rating of PG-13 because it has mild language and some sexuality.#3. It could get a better chance of being PG if you took out the language and sexuality.#4. I recomend this movie to people 12+ or mature 9 year olds.W ill Ferrell has done it again in Bewitchd."
2,I would have loved...,"This is how I imagined this movie would be...I imagined a woman named Samantha living in modern day New York, who happens to be a witch. She meets and marries a mortal man, who happens to be one of the top advertising men in New York. Now, I see them moving into a nice house (preferably the same ""modernized"" house from the series). And across the street live a couple, whose wife is VERY nosy; their name: the Kravitz's. And the rest of the movie would be about this couples' misadventures with Samantha's bothersome mother (Endora), father (Maurice), aunt (Clara), uncle (Arthur), cousin (Serena), and all the other meddling friends and family. I do, however agree with the casting of Nicole Kidman. I think that she will somewhat do the role justice to the late, great Elizabeth Montgomery."
1,A total let down :-(,"Not what most people would expect,I purchased this on its release date only watched it twice all these years,and won`t be watching it again any time soon...."
3,"Oh we wanted to like this one so much more.........but,","My wife and I were looking forward to seeing this one and put the kids to bed,poped some popcorn,and settled back. To be fair, the movie is ok but that is all. With the talent involved this could have been so much better. Michael Caine and Sheley MacClane steal the movie in small roles. All said, a nice try but falls short."
1,RUN! FLEE!,"There are not enough expletives in the English language to describe just how awful this circular piece of trash is. Use it as a small frisbee. You will get more enjoyment out of it.Inspired by the popular television, ""Bewitched"" sports some big names, and completely squanders their talent, (which is not insignificant). The fact that people like Nicole Kidman, Will Ferrell, Michael Caine and Shirley MacLaine could not lift this foul stench of a movie above the cesspit of mediocrity should sound warning bells to all and sundry.This movie succeeded in putting me off anything with Will Ferrell in it for a very long time, (I am still in therapy and dealing with deep emotional scarring). Only now have I started to give his movies a chance, and enjoy them.Basically, avoid this movie. Find a blackboard and run your fingernails down it. You will enjoy yourself a whole lot more."
1,The only good thing was Uncle Arthur,"I would save my money in buying this movie: story line is awful, and Nicole Kidman is no match for Elizabeth Montgramey. The only good thing that I like in this movie was the small bit part that featured Uncle Arthur."
4,A pleasant surprize after all the critics bad reviews,"I enjoyed Bewitched, and I am a fan of the original series (First Darren Only). They do a clever thing, not making Nicole Kidman actually act like Samantha (the resemblence is great), but only act like an actress playing Samantha. There are some laugh out loud moments, the supporting cast is pretty good, considering how much they had to live up to. Shirley Mclaine is no Agnes Moorehead, but she gives it a good try. Will Farrell was probably a bad choice, but you can tell he gave it his all.The best thing about Bewitched is that it avoids the hollywood sequel formula. Nobody steps in poop, nobody farts, Chris Rock is not hired to play uncle Arthur, its just good clean fun. You like the characters (well, Samantha anyway) and you want them to do well. Take the kids, they will like it and you won't have to explain to them whats so funny about ..."
3,Cute Movie But Needed Different Storyline,"As a fan of the TV series, I was very anxious to see the movie version. This was a cute movie, but I think it would have been better had the writers simply done a big screen version of the TV show! This storyline was off the mark. Another comment is that Nora Ephron is so used to working with Meg Ryan that it was pretty obvious she was trying to make Nicole Kidman in to a Meg Wannabe... little sequined sweaters, floaty hair, mannerisms. She probably didn't want to use Meg because she doesn't look like herself anymore after surgery, but Nora should have let Nicole be herself and shine!"
3,Just good witch fun,"If you enjoyed the original TV series you will probably like the movie. Fans of other light comedies that Will Ferrell has done will probably like it too. Most women and men will find something funny in this new approach on Bewitched. This time Isabel playing Samantha really is a witch, on the TV remake of ""Bewitched"". A well known cast, decent acting, good dialogue, and alot of goofing off make this a lighthearted decent clean family movie. This is good enough that I can see going back and watching it again sometime, and I think most people will."
2,Comedy,Actors remake the Bewitched TV show. Isabel is a real witch. It is not bad. Nicole Kidman stars in this. Contains partial nudity in censored form in a man.
1,Yuck!,"Awful, uninspired, pointless, annoying and dumb.Nicole Kidman needs to fire those who give her scripts.Will Ferrell needs to quit acting outside of SNL.Enough said."
2,Begone,Bewitched is a boring and corny remake of a great tv show. Not worth taking the time to watch.
5,Wonderful for parents with preemies in the NICU,"This book mimics everything our neonatologists have said! I haven't understood everything the doctors have told us, but this book explains it in a way that my husband and I understand. The book takes us through every step of the journey we've been on since our daughter was born 12 1/2 weeks premature.I will give this book to any of my friends who have their children prematurely."
4,very informative,"when my daughter was born prematurely at 29 weeks and 6 days gestation, i was devastated. i didn't know where to find information on premature babies. it was only after my baby came home from the endless days in the hospital, then i found this book. this book would have helped me if my baby were still in the NICU, because it provided a lot of information on NICU, and all the procedures and medical terms. it also would had saved me from looking so stupid in front of the doctors. overall, this book is highly recommended to all parents of preemies, especially if they are still in the NICU."
3,"Good for NICU, but not once you get home - Buy Preemie Primer Instead","This was a great read while in the NICU, but once I got home it wasn't helpful at all. Buy Preemie Primer instead. Much better book and it covers beyond your hospital stay.I'm the mom of a 29 weeker (1004g) that was in the hospital for 107 days."
4,Wish I would have bought it sooner,The book is such a helpful resource for families going through the NICU experience. I wish I would have found the book sooner. My twins are home now and I still find it to be a great resource for both singleton and multiple parents!
3,Not as expected,Too wordy and thick and being a sole caregiver for my newborn i really have no time to finish reading it. Good for people who wants details...
3,"great book, yet the one shipped seems to be a copy",I came across this book in the maternity library of the hospital where I delivered my baby. I find it is extremely organized and informational. It is very helpful if you have a preemie or want to know about preemies. So I decided to buy one for reference. I'm giving a 3 here because this particular book that I bought at amazon seems to be a pirate copy. The book is so much lighter in weight than the one I saw in the library because the paper is so much thinner. The edges of the book are not even neatly cut. Nevertheless the content of the book is exactly the same as the original.
2,Preemie Resource,This would have been a good resource with the exception of the large chapter dedicated to the death of a child. This was something that I did not want to even think about during this emotional time of having a premie. It was a scary 3 months going to the NICU and parents need to stay positive.
5,Great Book!,"I would highly recommend this to any new parent of a preemie.It has alot of very useful information, and is very well put and easy to understand."
5,Preemies,This product was extemely helpful in getting me ready for my twins. They were born 11 weeks eary and I was much more prepared for the NICU and what the care would involve for the hospital stay for my boys. I would suggest others with multiples or complications read it.
5,Great book,I bought this for a family member who delivered her baby 3 months early. She found this book very helpful and a great read. I am glad with my decision in purchasing this book and can recommend it as a gift or a book for yourself if you have a preemie.God Bless sweet preemies :)
4,Preemies:The Essential Guide for parents of premature babies,"This was a very good book. It helped my daughter and I better understand what was going on in the NICU and with my grandson and why things are done a certain way. It lets you know the criteria that your baby needs to meet before he or she can come home. It also talked about Kangaroo Care, which the NICU my grandson was in, never metioned until we brought up the subject.The down side was alot of the book also pretained problems with multiple births,so we could skip alot of pages that didn't pretain to us.All in All I would recommend this book to preemie parents."
5,solid information and perspective for new parents/grandparents,"As a new grandma of twin preemies, this book got me through their first months with peace and information. I love the fact that it gives different perspectives of the first weeks of a preemies life, told me what the doctors and nurses were looking for, calmed me with simple but complete explanations of what new terms meant, but also confirmed for my daughter that her feelings and questions were normal. Both my daughter and I have copies and it is a reassuring and realistic guide to surviving the first months of a preemie's life. Excellent!"
5,Saved my sanity when my baby was in NICU,"I could refer to this book to understand what the doctor was talking about... it broke my heart to watch my baby with all of those tubes and wires and such attached to him, but this book gave me hope. My mother's friend gave it to me when I went into the hospital the final time before they delivered my son (I was in premature labor and then preeclampsia... I was 32 weeks when I had him)..."
5,Great comprehensive book about preemies.,"I bought this book for my sister who is having complications with her first pregnancy. I got this book from the library and read it while sitting in the hospital with pregnancy complications of my own. It was a very comprehensive but easy-to-read book that really helped me know what the doctors were talking about and what to expect with my own child. My son was born early and because of this book, I knew how to care and advocate for him."
5,"Absolutely Amazing, and what we needed!!","We received this book from a friend when our son was born at 23 week, and it literally became our bible the whole 132+ days he was in the NICU. Everything the Dr's would tell us we came home and looked up, jsut to get a better understanding, and mark, to look back at even now (and he is 2) to find helpful information for us now, as we are dealing with developmental delays. I would reccomend this book to anyone dealing with premature birth, and I even gave a copy to my friend when her son was born prematurely. I hope that this book can be as helpful to other families as it was ot us."
1,It's a Commercial!,"This is nothing more than a poorly produced and undisguised commercial for Clark Custom. Rather than being a ""How to"" video, Mr. Clark seems to be reluctant to show us how to do anything. The disembodied off-screen straight man (probably Lenny Magill) constantly prompts Mr. Clark to repeat an instruction or show this or that again.The copy that I received was defective, and the last few segments would not read on any PC in the house, but by that time, I hardly cared. Skip this one and buy the AGI Armorer's course instead."
4,Atmospheric and earthy. Held my interest start to finish.,"I enjoyed entering the world of ""Skirts"" and read the book eagerly. It had no competition for my attention while I was reading it. I did not previously have any particular affinity for either New York or the Sixties beat scene, but Mimi Albert made them both so real for me I didn't think of categories but just about the lives of the young women I was reading about. Her writing was very grounded in time and place and her scenes wonderfully visualized. The book was absolutely swarming with mood and yet I never lost my bearings. Albert was always in control of her story and kept with with her start to finish."
5,Great Book,I read Skirts several years ago and loved it. I hope this gifted writer releases a new book soon.
3,Questions abound.,"I have given a three as it seems that the book we all clamour for is like ""Deep Throat"" himself was.A secret hidden away brilliantly.The same will apply to the book as Felt ages and unfortunately already is a man who is quite sick,with poor memory etc.I believe that the family should come first and that the realisation that Mark Felt cannot tell the story as many would like it should also be respected,As for one comment about this being the ""last of the Watergate books then"".Nothing could be further from the truth,the American public and their unquenchable thirst for scandal and hearing scandal at such a level is something that will always grow no matter how strange and wild the premise of future books where there is literary gold you have to mine it until it collapses in on itself and then pick through the rubble again.Ian."
4,Well made very sharp,"loses a star because it is made in China. use at work for making my lunch, use my Buck for everything else. Really Sharp! solid! no locking blade but it still feels safe."
4,What a Doll House,The video was very interesting and I plan to watch it again with some friends. The precise work that went into this Doll House is unbelieveable.
5,Sterling Holloway version?,I hope this is the version with Sterling Holloway (Winnie the Pooh voice) narrating. This is by far the best version. The one with Professor whatever is a joke.
1,not what i expected from disney,My son loved pooh's ABC & 123 I thought this would be a nice continuation for him but it was an older disney movie with a couple of breakes in it with a few problems for him. This was a complete waste of my money.
1,Recycled Disney,"This video is very disappointing. It's just an old Disney cartoon - Mickey and the Beanstalk, with some ""learning breaks"" inserted. I bought this because of the Disney brand name, I will be much more careful in the future."
5,my grandkids,they are enjoying it alot-over and over again! All the little one love anything Mickey!Thank you so much for getting it here quickly enough for Christmas.
3,A True Southern Hero,"This would be an excellent book to teach young school age children about the ideals of patriotism and loyalty.William Jasper was an immigrant to American during the 1700s. He became a soldier in order to earn enough money to support a wife. He was responsible for the building of Fort Moultrie on Sullivan's Island. During the American Revolution, Jasper was in command of the fort. The patriots were winning, however, a shot from the British broke the flag pole and the battle flag fell outside of the fort. Without this flag, the patriots would loose the battle. Jasper went outside the fort to retrieve the flag so that it could be flown.Many honors came to Jasper during and after his life."
2,An uninteresting history,"""History in my time"" by Otto Strasser isn't particularly interesting. The first chapter, detailing the author's escape from France during the Nazi German invasion, is dramatic and somewhat interesting. The rest of the book consists of short sketches dealing with German history from World War I to Hitler. It says very little and since the book lack notes, it could even be somewhat confusing to those ill versed in German history.The author was a dissident Nazi, expelled from the NSDAP by Hitler himself, and hence forced to flee for his life when the Nazis took power in Germany in 1933. Otto Strasser's brother Gregor was another Nazi dissident, murdered at Hitler's orders in 1934 during the ""night of the long knives"". However, this particular book says relatively little about this. A more interesting work by Otto Strasser is ""Hitler and I"", reviewed by me elsewhere."
5,another winner,I just completed a workshop with him and the book is as good as the workshop was. He gave his all with our group and this shows in the quality of the book
1,Don't rain on Ron's parade,"Hello,I don't have a friendship with Ron Conway at this time, but I did grow up on the same street in SF with him and his large family as a young child and as fate would have it, ended up working for one of his start up companies in the 80's in Menlo Park.I hadn't seen him since childhood, and was happy to see and know that he turned out to be a kind, generous, smart individual that treated his employees with dignity and respect. What more could you ask for?He has done more for the growth of Silicon Valley than anyone I know and we are blessed to have him as one of our visionary leaders and investors.I have a friend that works with alot of startups and angel investors VC's as a consultant , Sally Pera at PeraConnect.com, that keeps me abreast of all the workings in this marketplace.If I saw him again I would thank him personally for all he's done for our Valley and a personal thankyou from me.Kate Riser"
2,Would make a great article for the New York Times Magazine,"A fine attempt, but it comes up lacking. First, the book is short and reads quick. I had the feeling that this would have been better off being a Washington Post 3 part series (boring series though). All characters are sketchy and I never found myself caring about any of them. I found dot.bomb a much better read."
5,Booty Shakin,"I really like this album and i would like to be able to listen to it on windows or real audio on cdnow.comThanks,your #1 fan"
1,where is the rest?,"the movie was a genius, but they cheated us of the cuban music on the sound track, that i feel kept the movie moving with such a flow right to the very very end, with Te Busco by Celia Cruz."
1,Latin sounds not included,i am very disappointed that this sound track did not have the latin sounds included in the soundtrack so i returned the cd really how in the world do you have such amazing music excluded out of a cd that could of been a best seller. I am sure there are many other disappointed poor souls out there wishing they had those sounds that the movie included what happend?????Oscar Sanabria
1,Te Busco,"I'm glad I read the other reviewer's comments before I bought this CD and found out that Te Busco is not on the soundtrack of Lantana. If you are looking for this song by Celia Cruz, it is on a CD called Azucar Negra, which is coming out around August 27, 2001. This is the track listing.1. Azucar Megra2. Amores De Un Dia3. Sazon4. Pasaporte Latinoamericano5. De La Habana Hasta Aqui6. Ochun Con Chango7. Bolero, Bolero8. Que Suenen Las Palmas9. Te Busco10. Cruz De Navajas"
1,Latin artists / Lantana Soundtrack....,I would like to know why the latin songs were not included in the soundtrack? Where do I find a list of the songs and artists that were in the movie?
4,Dynamic Aussie Talent,"A dynamic and vibrant performer from the cultural capital of Australia, Melbourne. Able to hold her own against the best female jazz performers, Christine's performance is elegent and sophisticated, and remarkably easy to listen to.Christine has come a long way from performing in and around Hobart, Tasmania, around the early '80s. She now has performed with many of the great names of australian jazz music in Australia, and various venues around the world, including the UK. Christine is an accomplished performer with a remarkable voice, and a natural ability to interpret music. A good listen."
5,War for What? - A different point of view,"Somewhat over priced for a 1997 second printing but well worth the read. The American Civil War from a Southern Point of View written by a Mainer which asks the basic question: ""Why is all the hatred over slavery directed at the South?""Author Francis W. Springer, 1899-1991, wrote numerous magazine & newspaper articles as well as two books: February: American Myth Month and War for What?I highly recommend the book, not just for it's content, but because this is one book the neo-Unionist absolutely hate; like a burr under the sadle blanket."
5,The best book available on Schnauzers,"This book is highly recommended for anyone interested in Schnauzers. Mr. Gallant has been a breeder for over 25 years in the Netherlands and currently in South Africa. Excellent information regarding temperament, grooming, training and pedigrees. The section on the Giant Schnauzer is comprehensive and accurate. I recommend this book to all who purchase a Schnauzer."
3,Not what I was looking for,"The book has some good information. I was looking for an all around Schnauzer book, that told about personality, coat, energy levels, & showing information. This was not the book for me."
2,Pictures are in Black and White,"I was disappointed that the pictures were for the most part, in black and white. Although this is an imformative book, the cover would indicate that the pictures within the book are in color. There were only a very few color pictures in the center of the book."
3,Memories,This was truely a wonderful cd to listen to. I grew up listening to the music of my parents back in the fifties and it brought me back so many great memories.I was happy to be able to purchase this music! Thanks
2,Business Payton Place,"Focuses to much on who bought who, could include more focus on the technology in addition to the business side of the acquisitions."
3,Informative but dry,"This is an informative book for folks who are in the construction equipment industry. It may also have some pointers for folks who are in the B2B distribution business. However, the writing style can be dry to some."
5,beautifully presented,"Courtney Brown took it upon himself to present us with an alternative view of the established belief of the crucifixion of Christ.i give him credit as this was a brave initiative.well presented and beautifully laid out.whether you believe it or not, the remote viewing techniques appear to have a lot of validity providing the experiments are done properly.definately worth a look"
3,CHEAPLY MADE,I HAVE PURCHASED SEVERAL OF THIS BAIT AND THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED INCLUDE1) BAITS START LEAKING AFTER A WHILE EVEN BAITS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN HIT BY FISH2) Paint starts flaking off. Especially the hot pink bait3) Hooks rust very quickly although they being rinsed off after useOverall bait really attracts fish but it is not durable
3,Great smell; Too much smoke!,"I have to say, the candles do smell great, and I love the holiday scents, but I don't think I'll be buying any more of this brand :(I stocked up on these candles when I found a good deal for buying multiples, but JEEEEEZ they give off SO much smoke!Unlike the reviewer before me who said her smoke filled room was due to her forgetting to trim the wick before use, I learned my lesson the first time and have diligently trimmed the wick down as far as I can before each use. I just used three today--one in the bedroom, one in the living room, and one in the bathroom. I went ot the bathroom only to find the room engulfed in smoke (and that was with the door open). I blew the candle out and wiped my finger across the wall... soot... the toilet seat, too. Gross! I'd say the great smell does not make up for this disaster. Unless you like burning candles for less than an hour at time and are diligent about blowing them out at the half hour mark, I wouldn't recommend these candles."
3,"Few surprises, her novels are just as autobiographical","If you, too, are a fan Rita's, you will find few surprises in Rita Will. Much of what I read was fictionalized already in Rubyfruit Jungle and Rita's three Juts and Wheezy novels (characters based on Rita's dueling mother and maternal aunt). There is little, if any, information on Rita the writer and numerous pages of Rita the Daughter and Niece, Rita the Girlfriend (featuring details on relationships with Martina Navritalova and--surprise here--Fannie Flagg), and Rita the Animal Lover.At best, it is a fast-paced read, but I prefer her fiction."
3,A (Literary) Sneaky One,"I came across this book completely unaware of who the personna of Rita Mae Brown was. I have to admit her attitude came across as soon as I opened the first pages. As I pounded through the unfamiliar territory things kinda started making some sense although not completely to my liking. I had to research on her previous novels just to aid in my reading since she does quite a mouthful of occurrences that are ""funny"" but to a stranger don't really convey that sense. I would have to interview the author in order to get the incompleted suggestions of ideas throughout the book, it is rather a string of facts and impressions and many times also raw preaching (some of it is good thinking, yet I am afraid I don't like the attitude). This book may have some value, as a complement of other of her books and in entertainment as I actually understood some of the jokes and the laughable descriptions and she reflects the somewhat bland reality of the average person."
5,They feel as awesome as they look!,"Just got these in today and they are great! Love the way they feel in my hands and they look great. It's hard to tell by the picture, but the grips have an indent for your hands and the undipped part of the sticks are a dark brown stained hickory wood. They look as classy as they feel:)"
3,Is this the final season,"I do not know if it is me or a lot of my favorite series but this season seems to be consistent with my other favorites, criminal minds, bones etc. but I find this season lacking and boring especially the path down memory lane when the Dubois get married and especially the Peta EPISODE. I feel there are just too many writers pushing their agenda on the audience in all these series. I will not buy anymore of any of them. That includes criminal minds which was my favorite medium and host of others I watch. good luck"
1,Much lower budget this season,I watch episodes here and there from different season. This season has a much lower budget and you can tell. Story is ok but the quality and effects are much worse.
2,Sub-par video quality,"Just a note about the video quality of this CBS DVD (USA) release of MEDIUM - THE SIXTH SEASON: If the first episode is anything to go by - and it usually is - the picture quality is significantly lower than in previous seasons. It's barely VHS quality. Very disappointing. But, as usual, there is a nice set of extras."
2,Beautiful but rust spots appeared first time washed.,"This is a beautiful knife set and looks good on the counter. However, I don't know what they think stainless steel is...these rusted the first time they were washed.Unless you want to wash and dry them immediately after use, these will dissappoint you.This low quality seems surprising for Cuisinart."
2,"Sven Hassel did it first, and better, IMO","A lot of this book seemed very familiar to me, but I was reading Sven Hassel's novels about the 20th Panzer Penal Unit in World War II years ago. In general, this book is even more of a downer than a lot of Hassel's work; these future-soldiers do their work in a society and army so degrading that Hell itself would be preferable."
3,THIS IS A RED LIGHT!!!,"The image on Amazon suggests this is a white light. The product description does not mention it is red. The package does suggest white is available. I will use this light either way but I was looking for a front white light to illuminate signs and improve front visibility to drivers. It would be terrific if we could order this light in white.Addendum- I finally figured out I could just clip these on the rear straps and vastly improve side visibility, see the picture above."
4,Good lightweight helmet light,"It's powered by two watch batteries, so the light is quite small and light. One thing that was a bit annoying is that the light I got is red even though the picture appears to be of a white light. From the packaging, it looks like this light is manufactured in both red and white LED versions, but it doesn't look like Amazon lets you choose when ordering.The light attaches with a little clip that hooks onto the helmet strap. You're supposed to hook it onto the strap where it loops over the outside of the shell on top of the helmet. That worked fine for my helmet, but probably doesn't work for all helmet models."
2,"DVD Disappointing, but Music is great","The DVD contains no footage of Virgil Fox playing the instrument, but an art show on the screen; so the DVD isn't worth it, but the music is typical Virgil Fox, full of expression and fun to listen to."
4,Brainstorm is hurricane-force metal,"I had never heard of these guys before until a music store owner played this CD for me. He was blown away by it, and so was I. The guitarwork is amazing without being flashy or show-offy, and the whole album has a nice solid metallic crunch to it, like a monster tank rolling through a parking lot full of cars. So if you like old-school metal from the early '80s with clean vocals, then you definitely need to add this to your collection."
2,so so,"beautiful color, but very small in size, i guess i should have checked he pearl size first instead of just looking at the picture"
1,Watch Out!,These are poor quality re-recordings. This should have been mentioned in the product description! A DISGUSTING K-TEL SHAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,THEE SET TO OWN!!!,"It would take me forever to rave about this set, so I'll keep it short. Bach's complete orchestral works and concertos conducted by Sir Neville Marriner with an all star cast of soloists!...And it's all in a slim box too! The best music is all here, this is basically all you need for a complete set in your collection...! WHAT A DEAL...THE DEFINITIVE BACH SET!I wish I could add more stars!"
3,Negative trip that's full of vintage Tull,"It's not everyday you'll see Ian Anderson from the 60's, in his early years doing pre-stardom material so in that sense, this dvd is the best you'll find. They interview Ian (the interview is in 04 I believe?) about the ""Isle of Wright 1970"" concert as the cornerstone of this release. Looking back, Ian doesn't really look back at these days with great joy. The overall mood of the concert itself, and the band's experience was negative. They were constantly struggling for stage time, continuous arguing with whining fans, and bad promoters. The whole experience left me feeling down just watching this. The 8 songs were good, the time capsule perfect, but unfortunately it left a sour taste in my mouth yet it shows the real mechanics behind some these events. Still, it's something Tull fans will want to check out."
4,True Classic Rock...Jethro Tull Live!,"This is a great video in terms of historical value and musicianship. All of the band members were extremely talented. Unfortunately, we get just a few glimpses of the lead guitar player in action. The commentary was interesting, but less dialogue and more music footage would be preferable."
2,Annoying Editing Ruins Brilliant Jethro Tull Performances,"Poor Ian Anderson! It's not clear to me if Lerner edited this film or merely shot the original footage, but whoever did the edit apparently does not care much for Jethro Tull music.It's so frustrating to watch incredible concert footage interrupted every 30 seconds by some angry young man enjoying his 15 minutes of fame.I find this DVD virtually unwatchable and heartbreaking. It's not about the band or the music, this is a DVD about the end of the 60's except it was not done very well even from that perspective.If you love the band, brace yourself for disappointment."
3,when they will learn?,"I consider myself a big JT fan. I have almost complete discography of jethro tull and i simply had to have this dvd as well. The songs included are great. Its pure energy, pure joy and Ian's voice in his prime... The documentary and interview is interesting, very much so.My problem which is mirrored in just three stars is, that there are only so few songs and so much talk. If i wanted to hear Ian talking, i would go for their website and listened to the official recorded Q&A; which is about three hours of Ian answering any question you can think of.I would be so happy if the dvd was divided at least into three sections with the live performance recording in one uninterrupted stream. But it seems i will have to wait for official release of whole show uninterrupted. Its a shame."
3,"great dvd, but falsely advertised","awesome dvd of tull in their prime. but i agree with the other reviewers that the 'rock and roll circus' performance doesn't really fit in. it's a great song, but why repeat footage that is already available on the stones dvd? and where the hell is 'with you there to help me' and 'to cry you a song'? the set that is listed on the amazon page is incorrect! these two great songs are not included on the dvd for some reason. this would easily be a five star dvd if the entire performance was included, or at the very least if these two songs were included considering they are listed on the track list."
2,where are the rest,"My favorite period of Tull but I'm very dissapointed that they omited classic & one of my favorite tracks like ""To cry you a song"" and ""With you there to help me"" in favor of some stupid audience interviews & other documentaries. Maybe they want to make more money on this and will re-release those as a bonus/extra tracks in the future. Who knows? I should hunt for a bootleg of the full performance."
3,The Missing Year with missing/partial tracks - wait for it,I picked this up and then read what others had to say about it all over the internet and so I took it back unopened.Why keep it when I have a bootleg of the full video?We all want the full video in high quality.Not a piece of the story - the whole story..Give it about a year or so and I am sure a better more complete release will prevail.until then my semi-fuzzy copy will do
4,an easy read,"I read this book in one or two days and really enjoyed it. This book is almost a nuts & bolts book - a narrative about how the author's trip turned out day by day. It's more about the hike itself, and not very much about pilgrimage, spiritual or personal. I met the author in a business meeting, so it's refreshing to actually meet someone who has done the walk - just a normal guy and his wife taking an adventure vacation."
3,Great for Parents,"I was assigned to read this book for a class on Child Development. It went along with many of the main ideas in the text book about the brain development and growth of a child's brain from infancy through adulthood. I work at a daycare and would pay for the parents to read this material. It really help you appreciate how fragile children are, and scientific explinations for the wonders that they achieve every day. The writer does talk a lot about herself and her personal journey making about 1/4 of the book an autobiography, and she seems to brag a bit which is a little annoying to be honest. But if you can get past that then I think it is worth reading for the information that she provides."
5,Finally!! Brain research for every parent and educator.,This book is a must read for parents and eductors. It approaches what is being learned about the brain and breaks it into sensible categories of chronological development that all parents can understand. Diamond and Hopson give practical insights and applications that can be used in homes and in classrooms. What an exciting adventure to be part of the process which shapes and molds a child's brain!!
2,"Recipe for raising stressed-out, obsessive kids.","If you think your child's brain works like a rat's, then you share the company of Diamond and Hopson. Better change your nursery into a crawl-through maze and trade in the play-pen for an exercise wheel. The idea that stimulation increases brain cell connections in rats is interesting and explained very well, but there is no way to test this in human infants. However, it makes a good case for over-achieving parents intent on establishing home baby academies. I read cover-to-cover looking for supporting evidence that adults who were over-stimulated as babies are filling Ph.D. candidate positions in our universities. It is a shame that the authors do not give more credit to the human brain's ability to stimulate itself, arguably a major distinction between animals and humans."
1,Missed the mark,"On the surface, the authors seem to treat the subject of enriched environments for children throughly. However, there is no mention of the most basic tool for maximizing a child's brain power: breastfeeding! Human milk contains ingredients essential to the proper development of a baby's nervous system, most notably the myelination of nerves. In fact, some studies have shown that babies who are not breastfed lose up to 10 I.Q. points as a result. Why, then, have the authors of this book failed to cover this issue? This omission leads me to question the validity of the authors' theories. I would therefore not recommend Magic Trees of the Mind to other parents."
2,Beware.....it doesn't capture audio with video.,"I'm a new iPaq 5555 user, thrilled with it's features. This cam looks great, but in reviewing the user manual available from www.nexian.com I discovered that it does NOT capture audio with video, rendering video capture useless for my purposes.FYI"
3,doll,I think that the clothing on the doll will not wear well and I am worried that the hair may not be suitable for a 6 six year old.
2,Not what I expected,"I researched on Corolle Dolls before purchasing and most places stated the dolls are made in Spain.I decided to buy from Amazon as I was purchasing other items with it.I received my order and immediately noticed the 'plastic' feel of the doll, true enough after checking the box, it stated the doll was made in China. After untying the rubber bands on its hair, it became totally messy and frizzy.while the doll was pretty and it had the scent, the hairband came off its hair in less than a day while my 3 year old was playing with it. Though she loved the doll, she avoided carrying it as compared to her soft, fluffy teddy bear which she carries all day long, tucked under her arm.The doll's body also 'small breasts' which I thought was unnecessary as these dolls were meant for small kids/pre-schoolers.Overall, I am disappointed with it as I paid a hefty price for its shipping here, to Singapore."
5,Beautiful Doll!,"We purchased this doll for our daughter as a Christmas present and she loves her Chloe doll. Can't say enough, she is a beautiful doll in person, as she looks in the pic. I highly recommend for anyone's little girl!"
2,Problems with this item.....,"Well, let me start with the fact that it is hard to get it onto the phone. Plus, when you have it on the phone, it pushes down onto the SD card, which then in turn, causes it to come out, but as it is so tight, it will not let it out, which then causes a freeze and a constant reset. The screen is NOT accessible as previously stated. It does not allow the stylus to reach the screen to allow selection of items. Overall, I will be ordering a different case shortly....Any suggestions?"
2,"Great picture, when it works...","I should have checked for reviews before buying this player. I got it brand new and I still got ripped off. The picture was GREAT, and the EZ-view feature is perfect for my 16:9 TV. However, the player would often spin-down the DVD and claim it was un-readable or worse would lock the disc in the player until I manually opened the player to spin the disc with my finger and have it open. After the case was open, you could literly watch the DVD stop spinning for no reason and complain. Not a dust issue or overheating, just a piece of junk!"
1,Piece of Crap!,"My player likes to just stop playing into a movie and then when you press play again it stops again and this time it resets, none of my front buttons work, the power button on the remote doesnt work this is a collosal piece of CRAP do not buy unless you like returning items to target."
2,Poor remote functions,"The player plays OK except it has hickups like most others and it gets stuck really easy on ""bad"" spots. The things that I really don't like are the remote contol has to be aimed exact at the unit and the button pressed hard to get the unit to respond. It only has one button for both skip and fast forward or reverse so you have to hold the FF down to get it to fast forward. When this works, without skipping instead, it only goes either 2x or 8x. This can get pretty maddening when trying to scan while pressing hard and aimming exact and without skipping to the next chapter and the button is so small. It would also be nice if you could adjust the centering so that subtitles were not partially off the bottom of the screen."
1,STAY AWAY FROM SAMSUNG DVD PLAYERS!!,"PURCHASED A QUITE EXPENSIVE SAMSUNG DVD PLAYER WITH MEMORY STICK READER. IT STOPPED READING THE DVDS ABOUT 1 MONTH AFTER WARRANTY EXPIRED. SAMSUNG WAS NOT HELPFUL AT ALL. ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, IT STILL WAS ABLE TO READ THE MEMORY STICK."
5,Helpful,This book is ideal for leaders who want to include everyone in the decision making process. It gives multiple ideas and suggestions of how to peacefully achieve your decision making goals.
1,Boy! Do I realize how much I enjoy Hiassen!!!,"I enjoyed Tim Dorsey's first two novels, especially Florida Roadkill (which is what Orange Crush should be classified as). Dorsey seems to have thrown this together without any real direction to the story. His attempts at humor mostly fall flat. The characters are so absurd that it becomes tiring reading in a very short time. Marlon Conrad, the governor who has ""seen the error of his ways"" sounds an awful lot like he was stolen from numerous Hiaasen novels. Serge Storms, the key character in the first two novels is totally wasted in Orange Crush as Dorsey tries to make him respectable. The rest of the characters are quickly forgetable and not very funny.This was the third book in the series that I had autographed by the author, if they don't get any better than this it will be my last. Save your money on this one."
5,"Politics disrobed er..uncovered, er...revealed!",Politics has never been so much fun!The characters are so outrageous you would NEVER expect to find them in real government. Or would you?
4,Tim Dorsey,"Ah, another Serge Storms adventure, I just cannot get enough of my hero. Mr Dorsey is one of the most enjoyable writers around today. Another book loaded on my Kindle"
3,the crush,"The characters are not easily forgotten. Very funny, as usual in Dorsey's books. Excellent political 'enlightenments'. Much Better than Dorsey's Florida Road Kill. All Dorsey's books are very funny and hard to put down."
3,WAY over the top,"I LOVED this author's first two books. I've also spent years in Tallahassee dealing with the Legislature. As one of your reviews said, it's hard to go too far about that sometimes sleazy, often crazy, and astonishingly self-interested bunch --but this book may do that. It passes borders that Hiassen and Barry never approached, probably with good reason. This book is more of a cartoon than a novel. It's got some laughs and insight, but sandwiched between a lot of ridiculous ravings. I'm truly disappointed because I was looking forward to this book."
3,cheesy,I agree with the Reviewer below. Lots of facts but not a very engrossing story. I'm only on page 100 but there just isn't a whole lot of Lou to sink your teeth into. Alot of the writers theories on popular music over the last fifty years are a little ambitious as well. The prose can be overly dramatic and actually a little embarrassing at times. I'm hoping Transformer is better.That said. It is a book on Lou Reed. If you are into Lou you are probably going to look past a lot of the books flaws.
2,mixed results,"This feeder worked to keep the squirrels out for a few months, but then, as other reviewers wrote, the plastic began to break the springs fell out. Because it seemed to be working, I bought a replacement only to find the very next day that the squirrels managed to get it on the ground and take it apart. I've had much better luck -- not to mention entertainment -- with the Squirrel Stop Squirrel Spinner."
2,Perky Pet,"We have purchased this feeder before. We love it but find that the squirrels have a tendency to eat through the plastic. When we ordered this one it looked like the company had fixed their problem and made the holes out of some type of metal. When we got the feeder, the holes were again made out of plastic. We wrote and questioned this and never received word back. That really disappointed me."
1,Bird Guillotine!,"This bird feeder became a guillotine for one of our cardinals when the weight of a squirrel closed off the hole that the cardinal was eating from... I'd rather feed a squirrel than to kill beautiful cardinals....oh, and by the way....the squirrels LOVED this ""bird"" feeder."
1,Poor design; SquirrelBuster is much better,Poor design - springs breaks after one season - try SquirrelBuster. Works much better.
1,Disappointed,"The main part of the feeder separated from the top, fell and broke. This happened after being used for only 2 weeks. I have had to buy another feeder(a different kind)"
2,worked for awhile,"Well, it seemed to work for a few months. Then the plastic inserts began to fall out and the seed won't stay in. I cut some plastic replacements from a milk jug and these worked for a month or so, but more of the originals keep falling out. Three are gone, and the feeder is not a year old yet. My feeder hangs under the house overhang and so is not rained on; no problems with the spring, though the ""stop"" that keeps the cage from going too far down fell out fairly soon (I just put a piece of wire in its place). Grackle can feed at this feeder well. Larger birds such as blue jays and a large woodpecker will occasionally hang onto it in some way, but they don't persist. Purple finch and gold finch like it; I get some cardinals even (with black oil sunflower)."
2,Short term effectiveness,This feeder worked brilliantly when it was new.A spring of heavy rains rusted out the mechanism so severely that it stopped falling smoothly and my little furry friends figured out how to hang so the cage wouldn't budge.Not effective after one season.
3,Pesky squirrels have ruined it,"This birdfeeder looks very nice and is extremely attractive to hang in your yard. However, I have had trouble with some very adamant squirrels about eating the birdseed. I had even put out a squirrel feeder away from the bird feeder, but they kept coming back and once they jumped on this birdfeeder, the spring attached outer grid pulled down and stayed down and the little metal attachements that held it up broke off. I bought 3 of these feeders and all three were broken within the first week of being hung outside. They were hung off greased poles over 6 feet off the ground. One of the feeders came detached from the top and crashed to the ground when a squirrel jumped on it. Maybe my squirrels are just oversized (hardly, they are little and ratty) and extremely rough, but these feeders just weren't worth what I paid for them. Now i have three broken feeders and laughing squirrels!"
1,squirrels defeat the plan,"I have owned 2 of these feeders. In each case, squirrels hang on the feeder and gnaw through the plastic, fashioning their own holes to get at the seed. This is even with the doors closed on the feeding ports. So I did not at all find it squirrel proof."
3,squirrel proof bird feeder,"Feeder works but, after several squirrels try the top seems to unwind and the feeder falls. It also could use a bettter spring system that is a little more secure."
4,chipper,"I like this feeder. I bought the first one over a year ago and have had great success. It is still in good working order and still looks decent. I have several other types of squirrel proof feeders as well and I like this one the best. We have active squirrels but none have gotten to the feed (and they have tried). So, I recently bought a second one and it too is working fine. Not a very expensive feeder on Amazon when compared to other feeders. They are doing good so far."
1,I got snookered...,"The super-negative reviews surprise me. I went looking for the exact same feeder after having it hang by my kitchen window for over three years -- yes, I had to hook the spring back in place once, and now finally, one of the baffles broke and got pushed inside. I covered that hole with tape yesterday and it's still going strong, but the tape is ugly so I'm buying a new one. It's the best feeder I've ever had, and has a constant population of chickadees, blackbirds, twohees, finches and sparrows, with juncoes (and squirrels) cleaning up what falls on the ground. It's expensive, yes, but I expect to get several years out of the replacement as well. UPDATE.. not the same as the original, & broke after about three months. Never mind, it's not any good after all."
5,Amazon's fix for those rascallllly squirrels!!!,"This is the closest we have ever come to having our bird feeders, squirrel free! The design is such that the squirrels have a difficult time getting seeds out. Their weight is their demise and watching them trying to get to it is laughable.Our squirrels are rather ingenious and did everything they could to bring the feeder down. They did succeed one time only because of human error in not attaching the top correctly!Great product, glad Amazon has it and it's at an affordable price and our birds love it! Doesn't get much better."
4,Good feeder,"Our feeder has held up well even with squirrels try to get past the metal leaves that cover the feed holes when they try to get the feed. The plastic inserts that block the feed from falling out need to be glued after a year because the squirrels and larger birds will attack them. It is not maintenance-free system. You will have to oil the screw on top cap so that it comes free when you refill. Always make sure the baffle wire mechanism is free and blocks the squirrels after refilling and hanging. With proper maintenance, it's a good feeder."
1,No Such Item Works,I purchased two of this type of feeder. The squirrels hang on to the wire framework and munch away. Not worth it.
3,squirrel not gone,"The squirrels still manage to get food from this feeder, the windows do not shut down as I hoped, and I did not estimate how big it was until I got it I can't fill it up to full capacity for fear it will fall. I got the automatic spinning squirrel deterrent which I use with this feeder, but I can never win anyway, thedeterrent starts the feeder spinning to no end and all the seeds fly out of the windows spraying the balcony. (I live in a condo and this feeder hungs from a metallic tube).No I do not like this feeder, I keep it only because I damaged the packing which by the way was excellent."
3,Girlfriend says this is a waste of time.,"Holds a bunch of seed but within a couple days the squirrels learned how to hang from it without pulling the springs to block the feed. Also, in the short time we've had it the feeder loosened up from the lid and spun off and fell. Another squirrel feast. They also sprung one of the springs which blocked the seed. Attractive feeder. Enjoy the wild."
2,Squirrel Be Gone - NOT REALLY!,Had ours hanging under an overhang. Squirrels figured out how to hang from the top of the feeder with their back legs & help themselves! My husband cut off the over hang thinking this would eliminate a 'ledge' for little feet - they STILL were able to distribute their weight and eat the seed! I guess we have PhD squirrels as well. The squirrels chewed through the plastic also. I really expected more from this feeder due to the price.
1,Dissapointed,"Disappointed: Previously satisfied with an earlier model of this feeder, I ignored warnings by others. Within a week of using the new feeder, I found squirrels defeating the springs by hanging onto the top and easily emptying the seed. Now, one of the small plastic pieces which is designed to keep seeds from pouring out of the holes is broken, pulled loose by squirrels I think, and I had to seal the feeding hole with duct tape. Very dissatisfied with this products function and kicking myself for ignoring others advice. But it looks good, if you ignore my duct tape...."
2,Sometimes it works,"Do they put a squirrel flavoring in the plastic? No joke. They EAT the plastic openings and ALL seed is gone in a day. Epoxyed the openings this last time, hoping it would deter the critters but alas, the ate even MORE of the tubes openings. Aside from the latter, a great concept & it works until they figure it out. Would pay more if the desingn changed to include metal rims around the openings & a good spray of rustolium paint for it does rust easily."
3,You make the call...,"I have owned this product for two seasons now. Just like others, the squirrels here in Georgia have figured this thing out. They will either jump on the unit to cause the seed to fall out or they will chew new holes in the plastic to cause the seed to fall out. It is only a temporary defense to the squirrel. So, for the price, I will first check out others prior to geting another one..."
1,No Replacement Parts,"I purchased this feeder summer before last. Last winter the plastic ports that keep the feed in the feeder started to fall apart. I looked for replacements and couldn't find them, so contacted the manufacturer. This is what they said:""Unfortunately we do not offer replacement parts for this feeder other than the replacement springs. I will make sure to document this feed back and pass it along to the product managers. I am sorry for any inconvenience.""So I got about a year and a half of use out of this $40 feeder, and can't replace the parts for it. Will NEVER purchase from ""Perky Pet"" again."
1,Absurd,"The birds like it, but it's got a couple of serious problems: The birds dump more seed on the ground than they eat, which is not a problem with my other feeders. The really dumb thing is that it's not weatherproof--within a couple months, the finish just turned completely to rust. What is this, a birdfeeder for indoor use only? Unlike others have reported, I'm not having a problem with squirrels attacking it, primarily because there's so much seed on the ground there's no need for them to bother climbing the pole. I'm going to toss it out and get a better one."
1,Not squirrel proof or even squirrel resistent,"THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT KEEP SQUIRRELS AWAY FROM THE SEED!!! I hung mine and within an hour squirrels were on the side of it with their feet hanging on the lid and lifting the metal exterior. They did have to use their hands so there was no seed port damage but it didn't prevent them from eating at least 75% of the seed instead of the intended birds. My previous feeder with a smaller seed port that had a cupped bottom kept the seed in it longer even though it was not ""Squirrel Proof"". If you have a problem with squirrels look elsewhere. EDIT: two bottom seed ports were destroyed within one filling. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM."
1,nice looking / VERY POOR PRODUCT,SQUIRRELS DESTROYED IT IN ONE WEEK.It only took a very short period of time for the squirrels to chew up the feeder to the point where it won't even hold seed.Every time I left my house there was a squirrel attatched to the side of this thing. The so called anti squirrel features are absoultely worthless. Do NOT buy this product if you have squirrel problems.
3,ho hum,"Although faithful to what is known of the ancient poet, this book did not fully hold my attention. I preferred Erica Jong's imaginative and gripping story Sappho's Leap."
5,I really recomend this book.,This book was great. My son certainly has those vegetables he will not eat he was really able to empathize with the boy in the book. It also was a story about how everything we do really does have a price. Eventually the price for the pea eating became to high and he realized that it was not a big deal anyway. A very enjoyable book and the pictures were great too. I spotted this one on the new book counter and thought it was too good to pass up. I would recommend it for ages 6-10 years.
2,"The author may know skating, but not much else","I am a former figure skater and mystery lover, so when I discovered this series I was elated to bring my two interests together. I am very disappointed. To begin with this book is not well written. Books like this should be a fast, entertaining, easy read. I had to literally plow through the author's text. Then, the heroine - a TV researcher - found what she thought was a clue: a shorter than normal fax. Her conclusion was that it was European paper...when any good researcher, traveler or businessperson knows that A4 paper is longer than US paper, but slightly narrower. It is definitely not shorter. This was not a mention, which I could excuse, but for much of a book it was the only clue the character had. I lost faith. It is too bad the idea of the series is a great one with all the politics and drama that goes into skating, but this entry is definitely not a gold medal winner."
4,This is love expressed in the truest since!,I really enjoy the mellow sounds of Shola Ama. I'm so upset I didn't discover her sooner. I can relate to her songs. I feel her music becasue at some point I've felt the same way. Just buy it. I'm so sure you won't be disappointed.
4,Bea,"'For Bea' isn't just for dog or beagle lovers (though I do like both) - but for anyone who has had an animal who was more family than pet.It's an extremely easy and fast read. It is a little short on substance, but it gets to the heart of the matter quickly and stays on course for the most part."
3,Provocative subject matter...,"...but poorly written. Honest, the last thing I want to do is criticize the author, she is most likely an awesome person, but this book is way too ""flufffy"" for me. Written in much the same way as the book ""Best Friends..."", about the animal sanctary in Utah. I am an animal lover to the core, but I can't take all the fluff! If you like poetry that is elaborately written, or romance novels, and love animals, you'll love this book. I couldn't get through it. I give it three stars because of the subject matter. Every ex-lab animal should have such an end."
2,Disappointment from a Beagle Lover,"I have been owned by three beagles in my life, and I speak about them in a much more animated fashion than the author of this book does. I was thrilled to get it; I love any dog story, and if it's about a beagle, so much better. But I was disappointed with the way the book flowed. Much time was spent on the time right after aquiring Bea, and dealing with her adjustments, and a fair amount of time was spent on her declining years. But I felt the middle part was really missing. It was more about trials and tribulations than about the satisfaction of seeing a dog become an adjusted member of the family. I found the book depressing and sad, and the last chapter was too preachy for me to handle. She also borrowed liberally from her prior book. Very disappointing all the way around."
3,Came without the pulley,"I guess it's an OK product, but came without the pulley, and I don't have the tools to remove it from the old alternator. So it was returned. I purchased two or three alternators in my lifetime, but this was the first which didn't have the pulley, and the pic doesn't show the pulley side.So be warned - and prepared."
3,Cute...but that's it.,"Amazon, get out of the jewelry biz. Some things should not be peddled on the internet. This was a nice little piece but really, a bit of the same stuff can be bought at any fall carnival stand and be better quality. Being cheap and dirty is not what your image is. Stop trying to go there. There is lots of places on the internet to get junk. Don't be one of them."
5,Great figure.,"This figure is one of my favorites. It is very detailed, (I love the rohan armor.) It has a fairly good likeness to Merry from the films, and it is very poseable. This figure is one of the arry of figures you'll need to get to complete the Pellenor Fields collection.Merry has a sword that you can store in his sheath,(Although its a tight fit,) A cool-looking shield that he can either hold or sling across his back, and a sword-slashing action.My only complaint is that one leg is visibly longer than the other, which makes him hard to stand up. I like to display my figures, and making them stand is crucial."
2,Not much help,"I had an awful professor for this text. That being said I should be able to use the text on my own and learn the material despite my profs short comings. This book didn't give enough examples and also has no answers in it anywhere. I needed answers so that I could teach myself the material. This book also introduces a lot of new vocabulary and grammatical practices without any explanation.Also, there is an online program that goes with this book called QUIA. Never use it. The program is not user friendly and it is impossible to understand the audio clips because the characters stumble through them and say ""um"" a lot. I wrote the QUIA customer service ans received a very rude reply. After our experience with this my well known University has stopped using it."
1,I GOT RIPPED OFF BY AMAZON!,"I bought this book for a French class for about $150. And it says right on the book: CD included. And you know what? I got no CD with my shipment, just the book. So I asked Amazon to please provide me with the CD. They said that I would have to purchase the CD separately! I wouldn't have a problem with that, except that the book cost me a lot of money, and it really wouldn't hurt Amazon if they just included the CD with the book -- ESPECIALLY WHEN THE BOOK SAYS ""CD INCLUDED"". This is just plain wrong. You really suck, Amazon!"
1,Absolutely worthless,"There is no good reason for this to be on DVD or for it to be ""Blues"". You never get beyond absolute basics with this book. A total waste of time and money."
1,this is not worth the money!,I am very disapointed!! one wrong move and it comes crashing down!! I must not have the secret that everyone else has.. but my children are very upset when it falls.. as am I because I have to spend time building it up again. I'm sending ours back! PLUS the marble stops in the middle of the track and we have to push it which one hard push and there it comes down yet again!! what am I doing wrong??
2,"Quadrilla okay, but not great","I have played with Quadrilla at toy fairs and found that, while it's aesthetically appealing (forms, colors, etc.), it actually has limited appeal in the long run -- there are only so many things you can do with it. I vastly prefer Cuboro and Chaos Tower for complexity, variability and beauty."
5,Fantastic!!!,Ended up finding it cheaper online at a educational toy store but what can I say...this was just the best gift! My husband and I enjoy building it too.Definitely requires some thought since the instructions for the different sets are hard to decipher what is turquoise vs blue (you only get pictures to work from to recreate some of their suggested layouts). When we build it with our almost 4 year old son he's often pointing out our mistakes!This is his ultimate gift. Had to drag him away from it to visit relatives on Christmas kicking and screaming. If your kid is into marble runs this is the ultimate!!!Very sturdy and well constructed. When I saw it I understood the price. Awesome gift. Will last for years to come.
2,Wish We Would Have Bought the Cheap One,"We paid a lot more for this marble run than it's plastic counter-part because I wanted something sturdy.The problem is that putting this marble run together takes a long time and it falls apart easily. Each piece is so heavy it has to be perfectly bablanced and supported. If you are not on a perfectly level solid surface it falls apart. Forget using it on a carpet, you have to be on concrete or hardwood. It took so long for the kids to put it together they found it frustrating and quickly became bored with it. There are also less assembly options than you'd think there would be. It certainly is solid though. I'm considering selling it on Ebay and replacing it with a plastic one that snaps together."
2,It was fine,"When I first bought it, I loved it but after a month it dried out my skin and if felt horrible, I wouldn't recommend it for dry/sensitive skin, it would work best for people with oily skin."
1,Too expensive,In general in not worth to get super expensive face wash. Even if the face wash has high levels of active ingredients ( whether for acne or anti aging ) they stay on your skin for a minute and then get washed off. That's not enough time for the product to work. Try the clean and clear or Neutrogena Grapefruit face wash for acne prone skin.
4,Cheaper else where,"i have combination oily T-zone/dry cheeks and this works really well for me. it doesn't leave my skin feeling tight or dry, however i almost always follow up with a moisturizer before i go to bed. My husband who usually never strays from his Cetaphil even uses it and likes itThis product can be purchased cheaper at Sephora($16) - so the 4 starts doesn't go to the product, it goes to amazon"
2,Only lasted 8 months,"These headphones were a Christmas gift for my husband in December 1999, and only 8 months later the right ear no longer works (no sound). They were good while they lasted -- at a very good price, but if you want something that lasts, consider spending more money. As for comfort, my husband thought the ear cutouts were not big enough and hurt after a while."
3,Good while it lasts...,"Even though these headphones aren't aesthetically perfect and this model doesn't even exist anymore in most stores, I bought them on amazon because of the great reviews and the cheap price ($15.00).They were very efficient during the first 8 months or so, but now, even though I have always been very careful with them, no more sound comes through to my ears. You would expect Koss would make better quality products. I am now seeking to get a new pair through the warranty."
4,Not Bad,"I bought these head phones for college so I wouldn't disturb my roomates. They are a great buy for the price, but they aren't what I consider ""Studio Quality."" Don't get me wrong, the sound is awesome. Far better then any of the other head phones I've had (but I've never been able to afford the high dollar ones). Worth the money if you aren't an extreme audiophile. Only complaint I have is after extended use, my ears start to get sweaty. The balance is great, not bass heavy at all - don't listen to that other guy. The bonus earbuds are a joke - worse I've EVER heard, but the Head phones rock :)"
3,"Nice sound, cheaply made","While for the money these are an ok set of earphones, they begin to simply fall apart after a few months of even gentle use. The earphone foam covering simply deteriorates and starts falling off and the inside headband support broke off on one side."
5,good sound and comfortable,They are just like a ordinary pair of headphones but bigger. And they give you a smaller pocket pair. It's an ubeatable price for what you get so hurry and buy one.
5,Excellent and delightful!,"I have been using these phones for some time and find them to be comfortable and very excellent in sound! I highly recommend them to other apartment dwellers and to those, like me, who are often confined either to a comfortable chair or the bed because of pain --the extra padding on the phones is very helpful. I cannot say more about the sound, it is simply terrific!"
3,An excellent value for above-average sound.,"Koss has put together a very appealing package available at agreat price ... . The headphone set is uncharacteristically light and comfortable for large headphones, but that may be in part due to the plastics and other materials used in the construction of the headphones. Long-term durability may become an issue. As for sound, the Koss TD/61 headphones excel at low-frequency sound reproduction. Bass is powerfully amplified by these headphones, though boomy bass in rap music may over-tax these headphones at high volumes. Also, high-frequency sound is lacking. The range of these headphones tops out at 15,000hz. It is advisable to spend a little more to get a set of headphones which reproduce the entire frequency range of 20-20000hz. Also, look for a headphone set with full-size 40mm drivers. This pair features two 30mm drivers, which are better than stock headphone sets, but not as good as a full sized pair."
2,Spend the extra 5 to 10$ on something much better,"My favorite brand of headphones is Koss as ive never had somuch value in other 50$ range headphones. This model has so many cutcorners I will be taking it back soon. Flimsy construction, though lightweight, will not withstand the test of time. And a general -cheap- looking headphone design that is oversized is very unattractive to me. Sony sells similar 25$ headphones that look good and are very durable with gold plated headphone connections as well that are not present on this Koss model of headphones. Spending the extra 5$ to 10$ on headphones is worth everyones time and money, especially when product longevity is a concern. END"
1,About as bad as it gets,"I got these headphones today and they are very very bad. They omit the whole top end of the audio spectrum, i.e. almost no treble whatsoever. The bass is way too strong as well, so all-in-all they provide a completely unbalanced sound. Anyone who thinks these sound good must have no idea what a good set of headphones sound like, and is to be pitied. I bought them knowing they were cheap but I didn't expect them to be quite this bad. Back they go, if I can manage it!"
5,The undead,This book is great reading.It's very insightful and well written.I really enjoyed the comic for the Bram Stoker novel ''Dracula''.
3,Vamps,The book was funny and informative while it reminded readers that even though no one has discovered a real vampire that doesn't mean they don't exist.
2,not recommended,"Please note that this review is for theGarmin Carrying Case for the rhino. It seems the review is appearing for other products too.The holes giving access to the thumb stick, volume button, and zoom button are horrible. The case shifts a little and pushes a button or, most commonly, presses the thumb stick one direction or another. For example, my case liked to push the thumb stick down. The volume button got pressed somehow and my rhino went mute. I promptly cut the plastic away from the buttons. Problem solved. Only other problem was fogging between the display and the transparent plastic. Solved by cutting away more plastic and using adhesive screen protectors. Messed up the fit a bit too.I recommend just using adhesive screen protectors. The rhino might get roughed up, but the screen will stay OK."
5,Garmin Rino case,"A great case for the Rino GPS. It has a clear plastic screen cover. All the buttons can still be used. Con - No way to attach the case to you backpack or belt. The standard clip sucks and will wear out, that leaves you with nothing to really attach your GPS to you."
3,"Ok, but bad fitting","Works ok, but I would not recommend it. If I did it over I would buy the ""Garmin Bash Guard"" and put a screen protector sticker on it."
3,Decent product,"Decent cover, though doesn't stay in place very well and the clear screen area is hard to see trough with the sun. But in the way of adding protection to a very expensive tool, it is good."
3,Roundabout,"This book was required reading for my high school World History class. It was an appropriate read for high school, however I would not recommend it for anything else. The girls' letters give a wonderful and sympathetic insight to different ways of thinking in the Middle East. But their conversations tend to go in circles and they very, very often repeat themselves, as we all do when we feel confronted. Since the girls often confront each other, it is perfectly understandable; it is just rather tedious to read after a while. Overall, a good book, but I would not consider it an overly enlightening read."
4,Better than composite,"Since I didn't have an EDTV or an HDTV, This cable is the next best thing to a higher quality picture with older television sets with an s-video input."
4,Black Cherry Tea-wonderful stuff,This tea is very flavorful. I enjoy it best in the evening while relaxing with my cats and eating M&M's. I would recommend it to anyone who likes tea.
4,Cool version for the Vegas-fan,"This is classic Monopoly - nothing more, nothing less.If you are a fan of the original game and, like me, love ""Sin City"", this is a fun way to play Monopoly. If you play it with other persons who have been to Vegas, it's bound to spark some conversation about favourite hotels, casinos, places to visit etc, which gives an extra dimension of fun to a gaming evening.But don't expect anything more than Monopoly, if you already own the game, or don't much care for it, this brings nothing new.The game itself is of good quality, but except for real metal playing tokens nothing that sticks out as very special."
4,"Lost Goods, Amazing album that never made it to the lime light.","I was in college in Santa Babara in 1994, where this beautiful girl I was hanging with from Vegas, gave me this cd. SHe said one of the band members was a friend. I immediately loved it, and I still listen to it today, loving it the same. I am a huge music fan with a large collection. Out of the 800+ albums/cds I own, this one still gets played often. What happened to these guys? THe singer has an awesome voice, and for a small time garage bands first album (only album) it's better than most crappy bands out today.give it a try. My favorite songs are #3, #7, #8"
4,Le Trou,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
4,Interesting an effectively minimalistic prison film,"The Bottom Line:A film which would make a great double feature with Robert Bresson's ""A Man Escaped,"" Le Trou runs a smidge too long but is otherwise a consistently realistic and involving take on the fairly common but nonetheless riveting theme of prisoners trying to escape; with pitch-perfect performances by the authentically-bedraggled looking cast and a shot in the end that made it into my ""favorite shots of all time"" list, Le Trou is worth seeking out.3/4"
2,Boring film,Prison breaks are an interesting subject so this should have been a good movie. However I found myself bored by it. Whatever it takes to make a film exciting is missing here.
5,Denis Leary is one of the kings of comedy!,This tape is hallarious. Denis Leary is a great comedian. If you dont have this tape or CD buy it now! If you enjoyed this VHS or CD as much as i did pick up the Lock n' Load CD right now!
4,Still laughing,"I saw this video for the first time when I was still in High School, and since then in every town I've lived in I have been on a hunt for a local copy. Since the local stores are Leary-impaired, I just had to have a copy for my very own. Everyone I've shown this video to has become just as hopelessly addicted to it as I am, and I don't want to get over it."
2,Seriously dated,"This was good at one point, about a decade ago, but alot happens in a decade. First half he's got a little too much coke-laced hyperactivity going on, second gets better."
3,Don't mention Bill Hicks,"As everyone should know and Dennis himself admits, almost all of this material is a direct word for word steal from the one true genius of stand-up comedy in the last 15 years - the late Bill Hicks.Aside from that this is a spirited performance and well worth watching."
4,My life without me,"Found Sarah Polley films about 1 year ago. I admire this young woman and her body of work. I am into Indie films and this one is worth checking out, one thing tho, subject matter may be upsetting to some, that is why the four stars although for me it could be a five. You laugh and you cry. just great."
4,Independent films are the way to go,"Let me tell you, I am not the type of person to cry when I see a movie. I can count on probably 2 fingers how many times I have cried. This movie is definitely one of them. This girl is my age and she is going to die in 2 months wow. Makes you really think about alot and how if you were told the same thing would you act? This is one of those movies where it seems like everything that is happening is real. You don't even think anyone is acting. Thats what I like about independent films is how much these people put into this movie with very little to no pay. If you want more of a exciting story of a person expecially someone who is rich this movie is not for you. However if you want a real life almost too real film this is a movie that is worth checking out."
4,Carpe Diem,MLWM is a poignent movie and real people and a real life. It's beautiful and in the end it makes you think about how important life is.
5,VERY WELL EXECUTED!!!,I saw this film at the film festival here and loved it. It is all about real life and you can feel what the character feels and what she is going through. A must have for any independent film lover as well as others.
4,I cried so hard I almost drowned,"It didn't feel like sloppy sentimentality to me, but it was gut wrenching to watch. Everything in her life (the Sarah Polley character) was depressing enough to begin with... janitor job, trailer park, dad in jail, hates her mom, husband with no job... & then she finds out she's dying, decides to keep it to herself & makes a list of all the things she wants to do before she dies... what a set up!You can easily look at the list above & think 'overdone tearjerker,' but the cinematography is beautiful, it's edited so well, it has an amazing soundtrack & Sarah Polley, Mark Ruffalo & Scott Speedman give lovely performances.I cried through almost the entire film & for a good half an hour after. I admit there were plot contriviances pushing in a bunch of directions ready to yank tears from dewy-eyed viewers like myself, but it was still a thought provoking look at life & Sarah Polley is a goddess.I recommend this, but if you're a crier- be warned!"
3,One question: what is up with the whole Milli Vanilli thing?,"Too weird. But beyond that, it's an interesting film. It's occasionally corny/cheesy/obvious, and Polley's normal greatness sometimes verges into a WinonaRyderesque kind of vibe (I don't mean that as a compliment), but overall, it's real and moving, and the performances, particularly the supporting ones, are uncommonly solid."
5,Still with me,"I just saw this film today, and I know that it'll be with me for a long while. I agree with the previous review - there's a lot that in other films you'd take as manipulative or obvious - but here it works wonderfully and powerfully. I feel like I know the characters and I was drawn into their world and where they are in life. I feel heartbroken that Ann won't grow to see her daughters flourish, won't be able to share her life and love with the people around her. It's a film about life, about feeling, and about dreaming. The first 30 seconds alone blew me away - Anne standing in the rain, feeling it, sensing it, hearing it. Thinking to herself, 'So here I am, standing in the rain' and soaking up every single tiny, magical moment of it. I feel human from watching it. I'm 'one of the people who like to look up at the moon' - and I'm buying this DVD when the shops open tomorrow."
5,All I have to say is WOW...,"Sometimes I think people feel that they need to give a lengthy play by play about the movie including all the technical aspects of the film in their review. But, if you don't want to read about the entire movie before you watch it then this is for you. The movie was simply amazing. It was full of love, humor, cold harsh reality, and sadness. It conveys some seriously thought provoking messages and I'm always disappointed that great meaningful movies such as this one never make it to the masses and only are made known by our word of mouth. So spread the word, give it a shot, because if you enjoy movies, you'll love My Life Without Me."
2,My Life Without Me...Absolutely No Loss,"This film is hyped as the ""indie answer to `Terms of Endearment'"". Unfortunately, this is no rap in my mind. If there was a worse film than Terms of Endearment then I'm still to find it. Shirley McClaine reminded me of my ex mother-in-law and that thought sends shivers up my spine.""My Life Without Me"" does try hard and is well acted. The film is certainly believable. Indeed, the very concept of coming to terms with one's imminent death must truly be a struggle. This would be especially the case for the young. In Sarah Polly, a star is born!However, in spite of its charms, the film never really captures the viewer. The plot, to the extent that one exists, is tediously slow. I was constantly checking the time. I can only hope that Sarah Polly gets the chance to showcase her abilities in a better film."
1,Suicide Anyone?,"That is about how I felt after watching this - not because I was sad, but because I was BORED out of my mind. The dialogue was nothing special and it dragged on and on and on. I did not care about these characters, but I forced myself to keep watching - I think the best thing was the name of this movie."
1,What a load of rubbish,"This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen, aside from the Royal Tenenbaums maybe"
4,"Emotional, Wonderful story","This is one of those rare movies you stumble on by chance, and after viewing it, just can not believe that no one is talking about it. It's a sad, thought provoking, intense, emotional, and almost depressing even story that is not to be missed. By the end of the credits I had a river of tears streaming down my cheeks, neck and chest from this powerful movie. You can only imagine what you might do in the character's situation, what you would like to do if you knew you were going to die. You wonder how you could tell your family, would you thell them? Would you tell anyone? This is a MUST SEE!"
4,Good movie despite problematic theme,"Just found it in the video shop; obviously didnt hope for much, but it turned out to be the best movie Ive seen for quite a while.If you read the story, youll probably imagine Terms of Endearment or something of that sort, but this movie manages to stay a small distance off the ~beaten track, with some nice, original ideas. The casting is very good too (although most of the side-characters are Spanish, and I dont know how realistic that is in Mid-West America). Another small problem is the monologues "" there are too many, and some are too long. Apart from those problems "" great movie. There is no exaggerated attempt to make the audience cry "" but youll cry anyway Anyone knows how to obtain a copy of Ruffalos sisters cassette?"
2,Fine if you don't need much support,"This bra is fine if you have a small chest and/or you don't need much support. There's very little structure in the fabric itself or in the construction, so it's not a good choice for women with larger cup sizes or if you plan to run, jog or do other activities with a ""high bounce"" factor. I was hoping for a bra with more compression/support -- nothing was misrepresented -- apparently I just didn't read the description/specs carefully enough."
2,extremely loud,"definitely powerful, but way too loud. i felt like the neighbors could hear it. looking for something much more quiet"
5,Awesome,"This isn't something I'd have purchased for myself, and I was rather skeptical at first but have been pleasantly surprised. For something running on AAs, this really packs a punch - at high, it's almost *too* intense, which is a problem that I rarely have (and no, I'm *not* complaining, yum!). Control is easy to operate, and the switch in speeds is smooth. Is pretty quiet, also.Unlike the previous reviewer, I have to say I've found this really durable. Mine's still going strong - I've had it for eight months, and kill most of my toys in two or three :o"
1,"Broke Quickly, maybe overused ;)","It was cheap. Not really worth the money though, hardly vibrates as well. The cord developed a short within 2 weeks of owning it, and only twisting it certain ways would get it to work. I became so frustrated I decided to just rip the cord off and buy a Whals(sp)? massager.If you don't mind something big and you have aches and pains, get one of those. This thing is durable. The vibration is exhilerating. It does require an outlet, but trust me, if you have shoulder or lower back pain and just want to relax, it is amazing. Cheap, too. Lots of nubs to interchange. If i come home and have foot pain or shoulder pain, this thing makes the pain go away within a few minutes of applying it to the afflicted spot."
3,Not for Me,This was an okay toy but WAY too loud. I would rather pay more money for something different. Just not for me.
1,Didn't work,"When I buy a product, no matter how inexpensive, I expect it to work. This product was terrible from the very first time I tried to use it. I eventually got mad and threw it away!"
3,Hm..,"It's a nice little vibrator. Very small, but that's not a problem for me. It works just fine, and I definitely enjoy it. Still, there's better ones out there."
5,Inspiring!,Great for anyone wanting inspiration or help improving their prayer life. The prayers in this book are rich in theological truths.
1,No way followed the book.,"This movie was the movie industry's way to capitalize on such a good series. This movie was so far fetched i might as well watch independance day. Seriously, when in the book did the Trib force all perish, i understand this was the last movie they decided to make but they could of left it somewhat respectable. I mean, the ending was indeed funny, i still cant figure out why the president becomes invincible at the end of the movie, and ends up being the main character.This book may be good for someone who have never read the series, but to those who have it seems to be an insult."
4,Realistic,"Since the End Times will not be a happy time for those left behind, I find this movie to be realistic. The acting is a cut above many Christian movies, but maybe not up to Academy Award status just yet.Kirk Cameron is no longer the child actor from ""Growing Pains."" Unshaven, and a little haggard, he sets the stage for World War III. This movie series is a great testimony to his belief in the storyline.The movie also does a good job of setting the stage for a sequel. I recommend it as a witness tool as well. It's great for stimulating conversation with your unsaved friends and family."
2,Left Behind,I have read all twelve books in the series of the Left Behind. The movie does not follow the books. This last movie was not my favorite of the three movies.
2,Barely Passable!,"I loved the first 2 movies but this was a major disappointment. Brad Johnson does nothing but stand around and deliver lines. He has nothing to do. Buck has no GNN to work for. Nicholae and Buck never meet in this one. Nicholae has none of his staff from Tribulation force. Bruce Barnes death scene loses its value due to having to get a different actor than the guy from the first 2 movies. What happened to IVEY? no explanation! Where is Heim? Where is Ben Judah? Where is Bob Carlisle and his influence on the music? They are all gone. Slow dead mumbled movie with a few great special effects. I didn't wait all this time for Left Behind 3 to see special effects. This movie could have been so good. Best way to sum it up, It feels like a Lou Gossett Jr. movie with Buck and the cast as guest stars instead of the other way around.So Terribly Sad as Nicholae would say."
3,Why did they stray???,"I enjoyed immensely the first two Left behind films, even with their deviations from the books, however with this third one something seems to have changed. The writing just isn't as good, sure there are great moments in the film, but there were far to many just plain cheesy events for my taste. The message is still excellent as aways, and the visual effects are quite good, but the script seems to have gone a little down hill."
3,Good movie,"I never read the book series, so I can't say whether this is true to the series or not. However, it was an entertaining movie, but certainly not the best of the three. Most of the main characters from the first two movies are minor at best in this movie, and the main characted in this movie is the president of the US. There are a lot of things in this movie that weren't explained in the first two - new characters just springing out of nowhere as if they'd been there all along, new anti-Global World groups that weren't in the other two, etc., which made things sometimes hard to follow. And the ending left things hanging, as though there should've been a fourth movie coming. But overall it is entertaining and worth a watch."
3,Left Behind III,"This is the third movie of the Left behind series. The production value of this movie seems better then before. But this script cannot stand on its own merit. If you have not seen the previous movies, do not watch this one. You must see them in sequence to enjoy this movie. This movie like the others in the series does not follow the book. But seeing Lou Gosset, Jr. in this movie was a nice surprise. The movie also has a lot of well filmed action sequences.When this movie starts it has been eighteen months since Nicolae Carpathia's rise to power, and he has been captivating the whole world, including President Fitzhugh. Our heroes are back again and suspect he's something more, the prophesied Antichrist.The DVD special features include a couple music videos, a technical making of feature, interview with the actors, bloopers and outtakes, audio commentary, deleted scenes and a couple other bonuses."
5,Great entertainment with a message,From a Christian prospective this movie was not only entertaining but reveling. This could be a way that it happens but we really don't know. This is why it is SiFi.
3,Long time fan of the books...,"I'm a long time fan of the books, read them about 3 times completely and I'm not even a devout believer in the faith. For those that are these are great books... The movies, especially World at War, are considerably mediocre compared to the books so I'd recommend the dvd's only for fans of movies, and those that can be open minded and not compare them."
4,Great Movie,"I thought this was a great movie. It's well directed, acted and generally well put together. I particularly enjoyed Currie's performance, and the suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat. If I have one criticism of this film it is the poor special effects. Although they are obviously improved from the previous two films they are still too obviously fake. I really hope CloudTen can get this right for the fourth installment, and if they do I think they could easily compete with similar action films in secular cinema."
1,There's No Time To Change Your Mind...,"The 1st 2 flicks have come on gone...World at War gets LEFT BEHIND(pun intended). I hoped I'd never see the day when I'd have to give an attempted prophecy movie thumbs down, but here we have it. To keep it short and sweet, many of the same characters are present from the 1st 2 films(which were true to the book), however, this poses a great disappointment for fans expecting to see an adaptation of book 3, as Cloud 10 veers away from the continuum of the book series. It's a story within itself and the story seems to be thrown together. Definately not a keeper...stick to the first 2 and then add The Moment After and SIX:The Mark Unleashed to your collection instead."
2,okay,I thought about becoming a christian but after watching this movie I decided to wait until christianity becomes more interesting.
2,Straying,"I am finding the movies are straying a bit too much from the book. I enjoyed the series very much but disappointed in the way the series is going. Though I have enjoyed the message, I would like to see some of the same themes being carried throughout the movies."
3,Left Behind III,Over all a great movie for the collection. I loved it in the sense that it helped with the story of the left behind series. I am a huge fan of the series and Kirk Cameron is a great addition to the series. Well worth the buy and watch.
3,Somewhat Disapointing,"I didn't find the third in the Left Behind series to be very good. I am a fan of Kirk Cameron, and the rest of the actors did a fine job. The movie just seemed to move slow. The first two in the series were definitely better."
4,Left Behind - World at War,Essential part three of the Left Behind series. Good acting from a quality cast in a quality production of a most appropriate subject today. Be sure to see the series in order. See them all.
5,The movie that started it all!,"The movie that started it all! A thriller and a lesson all wrapped up in one with real movie stars!This DVD is very specific drama alone the lines of the Left Behind book, and a what happens next i.e. the days after. Good acting and interesting good to watch with some popcorn on a Sunday night.Another idea is Final Events, which is more encompassing, its not a drama, but a docudrama with a wider range of compelling facts and news reports of the Antichrist and the false god.Both are great DVD's, Bless both of them, and each of us!The Final Events DVD"
4,A glimpse into the near future,I saw this movie on tv and was surprised how closely it mirrors events of the day. I wanted to purchase it so that I could show it to some friends. I was very happy with the speed and condition that I received this order.
5,Hilarious!,"You know I honestly don't think many of you people realize that for a lot of us, these movies are just the highest form of camp, almost on a par with Cecil B. DeMille's ""The Ten Commandments."" Every one of these movies that I have seen, I have gone into with the same expectation: the acting is going to be hammy, the writing didactic, and the character motivation and plot is going to make no rational sense whatsoever (Communal wine cures the virus on the Bibles...OK whatever); at the same time I find myself smiling by the end. That's because these movies are so bad, they're good. If you like the kind of movies they show on MST3K and can stomach Kirk Cameron pontificating for an hour and a half to two hours (depending how many features you watch), this is a fun time for you. Also high on the religious camp-meter: NBC's miniseries version of Noah's Ark. Lord, I cannot believe how bad and yet how good that is."
5,Quick and tasty energy,This is a tasty flavor that delivers energy quickly when you need it. And I'm impressed with the energy it gave me for having no caffeine.
4,Quite tasty,These work fairly well... no bad chemical aftertaste like I would expect. It would be nice if they were cheaper tho.
4,Do what they need to do,"So far these are my favorite gels to use - that being said, I have yet to find a flavor I love and probably won't since they are not meant to be Twinkies. I am now trying the Rasberry Cream and find the flavor a bit more likeable than the previous Chocolate that I used (too much like thick frosting).I take one about 45 minutes into my run and they do help provide the extra stamina to finish."
5,PowerBar Power Gel Rasberry Creme,"I've tried this before. I like the taste very well, and the product delivers results.I used this leading up to, and during the 10-10-10 Chicago marathon. I tried the stuff at the aid stations during the marathon, and I am glad I took enough of this. I like the flavor much better.It is a good product that I will keep using."
4,Good Energy!,I have been using them for years and don't sport without them. The only change I would make is the opening for the mouth could be smaller. I find that they really provide a punch and keep me going with energy.
2,Changes in Power Gel's Formulation,"Agree with the previous user / review. The new formulation is much much much saltier than the prior generation of Power Gel. Not that we don't need electrolytes during activity, but if you are thinking of this as the old style gel.... it really is not. This is more of a concentrated electrolyte drink that has very little similarity to the other products I use -- Hammer and GU.... no more branched chain amino acids and no more antioxidants. I suggest GU for great taste and all of the key ingredients for a great energy gel."
3,"works good, tastes lousy","I bought a box of this stuff because it was on sale. It is the worst tasting gel I've ever had. Gel is gel, so pick yours based on taste. I won't get this again."
4,great product!,this gel provides me with my nutrition requirements during practice and in competitions (triathlons). packaging seems a bit weak around the seams. some of the packets arrived broken or leaking.
1,AWFUL,"I couldn't even finish the book, and I was very disappointed. I wanted to learn more about Sandra Dee and what had happened to her. Very little info on her is offered, and very few pictures. The emphasis was on Dad, Bobby Darin, so if you want to know everything about him, then get the book....otherwise, pass."
2,phooey,"boring book. father was a talented prick. mother was sweet and loving but emotionally stunted by a career that started very young and with a mother who, although loving, did everything for her. that's about it. i was really looking forward to this book. good thing i bought a paperback at a bargain price. also the pictures were grainy. sorry but if you are really interested wait for a really good buy."
1,Dream Lovers: The Magnificent Shattered Lives of Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee,"Penetrating. Worth looking at, taking the information at face value. Too bad the information is a little TOO personal and private and probably would not have been wished to have been shared, perhaps by his father, at least. Nobody is proud of their most embarassing moments."
5,Great read,"For those who are autobiography buffs, this is definiteley an interesting read. It's a beautifully written story on the the married lives of Sandra Dee and Bobby Darin as superstars and 2 people in love.Beautifully written by their son."
4,great buy,Love this item. Did not ship that quick. But was in expected condition and plays perfectly. Just thought it waould come faster as it was only coming from two hours away.
4,pretty good,this is a pretty good wwf ppv even though it was an undercard ppv. this tape has some good matches and some bad ones.kurt angle/jericho 8/10 dudlys/outlaws 6/10 mark henery/viscera 2/10 tazz/bossman 1/10 xpac/kane 7/10 radicals/too cool 8/10 rock/big show 9/10 cactus jack/hhh 10/10there you have it.
3,Average ppv,"This was an average ppv with only one match to remember which was the Hell in a cell HHH vs Foley. Mick flies from the top to the announcement table again and then through the cell 20ft to the ring. This time the barbed wire was set alight and it was extremely vicious, but Mankind vs Undertaker Hell in Cell was even better at King of the Ring 98. THe other matches were average including Dudleyz vs New Age Outlaws and Kane vs X-Pac. Instead of it buy Royal Rumble 2000."
5,WWF No Way Out is a 5/5,"Being a true wrestling fan really brought this Pay Per View to my attention. This was probably one of the greatest Pay Per Views in the WWF's history, and featuring possibly the greatest singles match in its history, the Hell in a Cell. WWF Champ Triple H defends against Cactus Jack, the hardcore persona of Mick Foley, with his career on the line. I won't give out any endings, but the effort these two superstars were tremendous. Other matches included Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho vs Eurpean Champion Kurt Angle and the Rock vs the Big Show for contendership of the WWF Championship. If you are looking for a real desent wrestling event to watch, it's right here."
5,No Way Out- Incredible PPV,I attend No Way Out in Hartford and I thought that it was a great PPV. All the matches were exciting with the exception of The Vis V.S. Mark henry match. The Rock V.S. Big Show match was great and the Hell in a Cell Match with HHH and Cactus Jack was amazing. All in all a really grear PPV!
4,1 OF THE BEST PPVS OF 2000.,"WWF NO Way Out was a very good WWF ppv.I would give it an 8/10 easy. The main event was Triple H vs Cactus Jack in a Hell in a Cell match for the WWF Title. If you like Hell in the Cell matches buy this video as the Hell in the Cell match is brilliant.Other matches include Chris Jericho vs Kurt Angle for the Intercontinental Championship, The New Age Outlaws vs The Dudley Boyz for the Tag Team Championships, Kane vs X-Pac in a No Holds Barred Match and a Wrestlemania Qualifying Match between The Rock and the Bigshow. OH YES MICK FOLEY'S CAREER IS ON THE LINE."
1,Belkin Extension Cable. Not an extension cable.,"Here is the problem: There are many various sized SCSI connectors that I am not attuned to; however, that is not the main problem with this item. The item is not an extension cable, rather it is simply a cable to connect hardware; rather than to add length to an existing cable. I did not return it as I do not have the patience to go through that exercise with Amazon. Another reason I am an infrequent internet buyer. I still cannot relocate one of our $25k scanners for which this was purchased."
2,"Cheap, but not a good quality Goji.","I agree with the post below, TOO STICKY! Mine were also stuck in a big solid clump. I like to eat goji berries dry or in cereal, oatmeal, or with tea. These were not very good for that. I could see someone who perhaps cooked or baked with goji berries that these would work, and they are a low price, but I thought they were not generally a very good product."
3,Ida had alot to say!,"Ida B. Wells' Crusade for Justice is an in depth look into her life long social struggles and strivings. It is obvious that she was a writer because this book is lengthy and wordy, and well it might just feel like its take a ""life long"" to read it. The book held my interest because it was in her own words, but it was a hard read."
3,Ida B. Wells,"Although Ida B. Wells is a long repetitive book, it offers a good incite on an African American Woman's perspective of the time period. The book offers a lot of knowledge about the different anti-lynching and anti- segregation movements that were being made around the world and around the United States, but mostly focusing in Chicago. The downside of the book is although written by Wells, you do not get a good sense of her personal life. It would have been great to learn what made her tick, and more about her family life. Overall the book is a bit hard to read and to get through, but the information that you get out of the book is very valuable."
4,VERY GOOD!,"One of the best books assigned so far in a history class based on reading about and by important people over time. Hearing and reading from the views of Wells really helps to inform the reader/researcher on where Wells is coming from and how deeply she is involved in her efforts. A really really great read. Only downside might be it can be repetitive at times, but stick through it. It's worth it."
3,IDA B. WELLS,"This book was quite reduntant and hard to read. If you're looking on gaining knowledge on the general time period, if you just skim through it you'll be able to understand the basic gist of the clubs and organizations that were being created during Reconstruction in order to fight inequalities and most especially lynchings. My favorite part of the book was the chapter on her divided loyalties because she does bring into light her humanness and how hard it was to live as a woman with vision but also with a desire to have a family. This brings a lot of insight into how hard it must have been to stand up against oppression during these times."
2,Informative but,"Acct. of powerful, courageous, amazing womun. The passion gets lost in the details. Recommend reading a biography rather than this autobio."
5,Galvatron LIVES!,"This is the best repaint that's ever been given to a Transformer, because it is a clear homage to the Generation 1 Galvatron. The only problem is that the figure is expensive and it's difficult to justify buying it if you already paid the same amount for the Energon figure, which is essentially the same figure. In the anime Superlink, (Energon in the US), this is what Galvatron looks like when he becomes a gigantic Transformer in Episode 48."
1,Misleading Title,"This is easily the most misleading title I'm sad to say. I've wasted 60.00. It has no real information to prepare you for the Novell certification tests. e.g. Service and Support, probably the most complex test, gets 38 pages; only 16 that contain info and not a fraction of it covers what is on the test. If you use this as a study guide, you will NOT pass one test.About the only thing it does is tell you the titles of the tests and you can get that for free from Novell. Also, it stresses the importance, and with this book the necessity, of taking the Novell courses and taking GOOD NOTES. Yet the cover boldly states ""Master the material quickly - without costly courses.""If I could have looked through it at the bookstore, it would have been in my hands less than 2 minutes before it was back on the shelf.I'm stuck. I'm trying to help others avoid getting stuck."
1,CNA/CNE Study Guide,"This book is a very good book for the beginning novice. It tells how to go about getting a certification and what you can do with it. But, this book has almost no techinical information you couldn't get out of the manual. It's software has yet to run on my computer, and it looks like it is sorry anyway. The book contains ""cute"" little games and crossword puzzles that hold absolutley no basis on the material. The CD that comes with it contains little programs to ""help"" you with your certification process, though they have absoultley no basis on the material."
1,Looking for a book to help get your CNA/CNE? This isn't it.,"The back cover of this book states that it has everything you need to get your CNA/CNE. Once I started reading it I discovered that there is very little real technical information in it and lots of advice from the authors to take Novell training, which is what I was trying to avoid. If you like cutesy puzzles and word games, you'll love this book but if you're after the real details-look elsewhere."
2,Very disappointing outcome of expectations,"This book is more or less an insult to McGraw-Hill's reputation. It has little to add to help gain real knowledge of how-to, hands-on experiences. The enclosed CD is a come-on that simply reiterates what is in the text questions (that is, if you can get the CD to run at all). There must be other sources out there that are more helpful in helping one get real network knowledge and experience."
1,Absolutely rock bottom reliability & build quality.,"This vacuum cleaner is poorly built and designed. It lasted only a year and a half of moderate use in my household. During that time, its wheels broke twice, the lower hose became clogged repeatedly (unclogging it is no easy task either), the cleaner went through belts unreasonably quickly, and it has now given up the ghost with a motor that overheats after about 10 minutes of use.This is certainly the last Eureka vacuum I will own. I would not recommend it to anyone even at half its listed price. A sad example of junk that is built to disintegrate shortly after the warranty period expires."
2,Pretty good until the inevitable breakdown,"I bought this vacuum a little less than a year ago, and it did the job. It picks up very well, and I liked the bagless style (not sure why they bother with a HEPA filter though--dumping the dirt from the canister would be a nightmare to people with allergies.) I did have problems with the lower hose getting blocked, but though it was a pain to clear it, I was still happy overall with this cleaner.HOWEVER, it's completely broken in less than a year of average use (vacuuming twice a week). The end of the beater bar broke because some of the plasic part that held it deformed from overheating. My vacuum repair shop said they could fix it with new parts, but that it would just happen again. They also said they see Eureka vacuums all the time because they're not built to last. I wouldn't recommend this cleaner, and won't buy Eureka again because I can't afford a new vacuum cleaner every year. Do yourself a favor and find something more durable."
5,MMMMmmmmmm,"Nacho cheese is sooooooooooooooooo yummmmy. I was so happy to purchase this cheese for our nacho maker, however it caused me to gain so much weight that my fingers grew so fat that i am unable to use this keyboard without my typing wand. Enjoy your nachos."
5,Crosswinds,"I bought this album back in 1987 direct from the band (and signed) at a gig in Wales, within three years I had worn out the vinyl, so I was unable to play it any more.That should give you an idea of just how good this record is, many say that the early Capercaillie stuff is less honed than the their later stuff, but I think it has the rawness that the music needs to be shown off to it best.The style is younger than the records they produce today, but they were younger, and we've all matured from 1987."
4,I don't often laughout loud while reading!,"This is just a pure fun book, but with a fascinating plot. The characters just keep evolving and crossing paths, although there are many occasions when you forget who is whom. I was sure that the ending wouldn't be as enjoyable as the rest of the story, but I was wrong.If you're looking for a cerebral read, then keep going. But if you want a story that laughs at itself and its characters, and makes you laugh in turn, then look no further."
2,Low budget Hiassen imitator,"Dorsey tries to amplify everything that Carl Hiassen does in his very successful and popular series, and by doing so, he creates a jumbled mess. What plot line there is is silly and nonsensical, the characters are all too strange to be even partially believable. He's trying to cash-in on a better writer's turf, and isn't very clever. Hiassen has many strange characters, but most of them are believable, if only because they represent some archtype or another. I felt like I had wasted my time reading this book and promptly took all the other Dorsey books off my ""wish list"""
2,Ugh,"Yes, some of the puzzles are very intriguing and interesting, but overall, they're not great. The answers sometimes make no sense, and they don't always have the answer. The puzzles sometimes don't make sense either. There are definitely other puzzle books much better than this one. I didn't purchase this myself (I received it as a gift), but I still feel that this isn't something to spend money on. Maybe at most like 50 cents. The colors are pretty and the illusions in the back are cool, but really, it's not worth it."
2,Boring,This book was so boring that I skimmed most of the pages just to get to the mystery. So much superfluous information that just seemed to go on and on. I do not recommend this book at all.
2,not too interesting,Holly is best when she stays in the obedience ring. Her sidebar into Massachusetts history is forced and uninteresting and so are the characters she introduces in this one.
3,Scott Baio all grown up as the bad guy,"3 of 5 stars for this action movie. Our friend Mitch is a wash-out in stock car racing. Through a friend, gets a chance meeting with a high-rolling ""broker"" named Chase (Scott Baio all grown-up and doing the bad buy role). The kid gets hired as a mechanic for Chase's cars. The FBI has been closely watching Chase as they suspect he is importing/exporting illegal stuff. There is an FBI undercover agent who gets caught and killed. So the FBI turns to our kid to help them learn when a ""big shipment"" is due. Throw in Chase's sexy daughter who is hot for our kid and you have the story. There are some good driving scenes that are well created. Baio does a good job in this role. The kid is OK. Oh, did I mention the sexy daughter?All in all a good movie and a great way to fill a Saturday afternoon. Recommended."
4,VIDEO,BOUGHT AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY HUSBAND WITH A RECOMMENDATION FROM A FRIEND. ANXIOUS TO SEE HOW HE LIKES
1,Low Budget. Title Doesn't Even Match the Thin Plot,"Don't bother. That's all I have to say. Rented this from Netflix, watched 30-min. of it, then sent it back. I mean, for crying out loud, you could see how poorly they cleaned the cars in this movie, let alone the fact that any of the car chases were obviously done at like 40 mph and just made to look faster. Oh it's just a bad, bad, bad movie!"
1,not very helpful,great condition. but it was not very helpful to me. i will keep it though for future reference. thank you.
5,"Good economics vs. bad government policies, all explained in an understandable and easy-to-read manner","This book demonstrates that our ""common sense"" should tell us what constitutes good economic policies. The book rationally debunks most of the arguments made by Statists (both Democrats and Republicans), that the government should tinker with a free market. This book has equiped me to refute the irrational arguments we hear for excessive government intervension in the our economy.The author is both a first class economist and a good writer, so the book is clear and easy to read. My copy is is now heavily underlined and annotated.Enjoy-Learn-Annoy a Statist!"
1,Short-sighted,I had to read and analyze this book for class and I found the material to be rather dense. The author misrepresents Keynes frequently. My advice to Mr. Hazlitt is to stop breaking windows in the first place.
2,sega game gear road rash,"The description of the game said that it would come with the plastic case for the game. I did not get said case, other than that it's fine."
2,missing something,"The plot of this book flows along at a fast pace, coming to a conclusion that very neatly wraps up everything into the nice package of where Peter Pan as we know it begins. However... I felt that although the plot was conveniently going in the right direction, it was also completely wrong. The mermaids and flying and Tinkerbell and everything else magical in the book are treated like the effects of radiation rather than magic. None of the characters are examined deeply at all. I'm very disappointed. I was very confused as to why Peter's grammar teacher spoke with bad grammar! If this was meant as a joke, it just came off as bad writing. I decided to give my copy away."
2,Really no relation to Barry classic.,"The basic story is OK but is lacking the magic of Peter Pan. I had my thirteen year old who loves Peter Pan read it and he was unimpressed as well. Like others have said it looks like it was written to cash in on 'Finding Neverland' and appears to be the first draft of a screenplay for Disney or DreamWorks.If you enjoyed ""Hook"" as a sequel, you will probably enjoy ""Peter and the Starcatchers"" as a prequel."
5,Review,"I haven't read this book yet. I just finished one of Ridley Pearson's books, it is called The Kingdom Keepers. It was really good. I can't wait to read this one."
4,The Secrets behind Peter Pan,I loved this book very much. I was very surprised to find out (...) was the crocodile. Also I was surprised about Tinkerbelle. The book was very long for a children's book. Also in different parts of the book it was dragged.
4,Entertaining For All Ages,"My ten-year old gave this book to me so I could read it while on vacation. I had a couple other books on my list first (!) and so I started it on the plane home, and then finished reading it while she was in close proximity, asking eagerly, ""what's happening now? What's happening now?"" I dare say I enjoyed ""Peter and the Starcatchers"" almost as much as she did! It's a great, fantasy story and particularly interesting for anyone who knows the story of Peter Pan and The Lost Boys. (You'll never look at a shooting star the same way again.) I recommend for kids and adults alike. It's well written and . . . funny!From the author of ""I'm Living Your Dream Life,"" and ""The Things I Wish I'd Said,"" McKenna Publishing Group."
4,Peter and the Starcatchers,"This explains how Captain Stach lost his hand and he might become Captain Hook. This book also explains how The Neverland island got its name,how the mermaids came to be,and how Peter came to be with Tinkerbell. This amasing book also tells how Peter could fly,and never grow up.Finally the Starcatchers caught the magic that was causing all the truble,the magic turned fish into mermaids and tinkerbell...you will just have to read the book to find out."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"As a stand-alone story (not a ""prequel""), this book is relatively fun - if you can ignore the countless glaring grammatical errors and typos. I can't believe this made it past editing!As far as being a prequel to Barrie's Peter Pan, this book misses the mark. There are too many blatant inconsistencies for this to be anything but a shallower ""re-telling"" of Barrie's richly woven classic. These are not the characters we knew and loved; this is not the Never Land we dreamed about at night. Pixie dust is now nothing more than ""space dust"" which causes strange and unpredictable genetic mutations on contact. Need I say more?"
3,fun but NOT Peter Pan,"The first 150 pages were great then it all went horribly wrong. What started with adventure, mystery, and wit turned into secret societies, conspiracies, and an almost science-fiction mcguffin. All the wonder was explained away: faries are now the result of magical ""radiation"" and have nothing to do with belief; Neverland, instead of ""second star on the right and straight on till morning"" is now seemingly somewhere in the tropics. It is witty and well written but it is not Peter Pan.Plus the ""prequel"" doesn't quite match the original. J. M. Barrie's ""savages"" are indians, Barry's are not. Etc.I hope the authors write another book but I hope they leave the Eternal Boy out of it."
2,"I only got halfway through, it was so SLOW.","The short chapters help the story move along, but a VAST MAJORITY of the book is just ONE BIG PIRATE SHIP FIGHT. It got SUPER boring after reading page after page after page of the same content. The writing techniques are the same in every chapter. I would of liked to finish it, but I couldn't of without falling asleep. Waste of money!!!"
4,Good read,Good story for a family of readers. Part of a series that my family enjoy's reading together. Great story for everyone.
5,Can't Get Enough,"I have been reading a few chapters of this book each night to my kids. The only problem is, my children don't ever want me to stop. They absolutely love it and can't wait for our storytime each night. The story pulls you in from the very beginning and it is very hard to put down, even for me. Love Love Love it, can't wait to see what happens next!"
5,Inspired my 10-year-old to read,"I bought ""Peter and the Starcatchers"" for my son at a book signing in Marin. Since then he's been unable to put it down. (Mind you, this is a boy who tried to pass off listening to books on tape for his weekly reading homework.)From a mom's view it's a fun read with an engaging plot and colorful characters, but most importantly, it inspired my son to read.Debbie Farmer, author of ""Don't Put Lipstick on the Cat"""
3,Fun and original but way to long,It was origianl and fun and it's a page turner at times. It answerd lots of questions like how dose Peter fly and why he dosent get older and why captain Hook hates Peter. It's just long for a childrens book it's over 400 pages and I found that it draged on at times. At times it has charm like Harry Potter and I hope more Peter adventures come.
2,Needs an editor,"This book is just OK, not great. There are several typographical errors, which I haven't seen in a mainstream book in quite a while. When the authors describe the pirates' sails, you know it is actually their extremely immature fantasy. Occasionally it is obvious there are two writers, eg, the word ""tentatively"" is used twice on the same page to describe someone's actions. The editor seems asleep at the wheel. If you are really interested in Peter Pan, it's worth a read; it not, I'd pass."
5,A Great Book to Share With Your Kids,"The story in this book and its sequals is far more entertaining than the Disney movie from which they are based. I have read these books with my nine year old daughter and it has been a great experience. Be warned that the ick factor is more on par with Harry Potter than with the original Disney movie, but the realism that it adds is definitely worth it."
3,Welcome to Disney Land!,"Oh, wait, I mean Neverland! This book, written by Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson, is based on the Peter Pan movie by Disney and not on the original book by Sir James Barrie. So if you are a fan of the cartoon you will love it. But if you are a fan of the original Peter Pan, with Hook having the hook on the correct hand, the right hand, you will not be too happy with this book. They try to explain everything. From the fairies to the mermaids. They kind of suck out all the magic. Because I am use to the book version, the version I love, many of the characters seem off."
4,4 and 1/2 stars - this audio book is awesome!,"My son and I listened to the prequel to Peter Pan. I expected it to be uninteresting and doubted my son would enjoy it, but to my surprise we both love this story. We especially have fun guessing what would be in the trunk and who would be characters that end up in the Peter Pan story...it is a really fun listen. Jim Dale is always an excellent reader, much like his reading of Harry Potter series! The audio book is a great combination of a fun story and an excellent reader!"
2,Disappointing,"With two well-known authors--comic writer Dave Barry and thriller novelist Ridley Pearson--on board this reimagining of the Peter Pan saga, I was prepared for a much better book. Nothing much happens until they get off the ship, then the island is rarely sparsely and drably imagined. With Dave Barry as one of the authors, I thought there would be a lot more humor, especially in a book aimed at younger people. The crocodile is ho-hum, the Indians are ho-hum, and Tinker Bell's appearance gets a whole page. Flat and uninvolving novel. Sorry, guys!I hear the play made from this is quite good, however."
4,wonderful for children and adults,"I just finished reading this aloud to my children, boys age 9 and 6, and daughter, age 3. IT WAS WONDERFUL! The boys asked every night ""Is it time to read Peter?"" They loved the excitement on the ship and the island. Yes, I ""reworded"" a few sentences to simplify for them, but, overall, we thoroughly enjoyed this. We hurried to start Peter and the Shadow Thieves, which I will review later (but loved it, too!) My boys and I are definitely ""hooked"" on these books!"
5,"Just finished reading this with my 8 year old son--he summed it us as ""Wow!""","This was a fun read from start to finish. It started quickly, and then kept going all the way through the book. With 78 chapters, many are short--only two or three pages--so we would frequently read three or four chapters at a time.Well written, you learn more about Peter, the magic behind how he can fly, and where Never Land got it's name."
1,very surprised!,"I got to page 54 I think and the scene described was shocking! I put the book down and have not finished it! For a youth reader book, this was very inappropriate!"
1,It was terrible!!!!!!!,"I hate, hate, hate this book! I don't know if you would like it or not but I don't. People don't have the same taste in books."
4,Peter and the Starcatchers,"Peter and the Starcatchers is the story before Peter Pan. Peter is an orphan and gets sent on a ship with a mysterious treasure chest. But chaos explodes and Peter and his friends find themselves on an island full of natives, pirates, and mermaids."
4,"Very good, but not very Peter Pan","This was a great adventure book, but not really a Peter Pan book. Even though Peter, the main character is supposed to be the real Peter Pan and live on Never-never land, there are many inconsistencies that other reviewers have pointed out.I read this book first, then I read Peter Pan because I wanted to know what it was about. When I read this book alone, I really liked it because it is a reasonably well-written adventure story with all the basic parts. There isn't anything really extra-ordinary about it.This is not a bad book, just a normal one. A worthwhile read, but don't expect anything stupendous or mind-blowing."
3,Learning Carpets Giant Road LC 124,It is more difficult for my grandson to take it with him on trips to my house. It is not as wide as I had hoped it would have been. The Driving Around Town Foldable Play Mat was much better and easier to store.
5,Great Road Rug!,We are very happy with this rug! It was purchased for my 18 month old who loves pushing cars around on the floor. He really likes it and his older brothers are enjoying it as well. It seems to be durable and of good quality too!
3,Poor traffic design,"My son played with this road carpet frequently when he was 2 to 3 years old. The way the roads are laid out is not realistic which bothers me, but my son doesn't know any better (yet!)."
2,Any ol' rug would have worked just as well,"My kids walk on this rug, they sit on it and play, but they do not drive vehicles on it. After the first week, they seemed to stop noticing it was designed like a little town, with streets etc. It was just a rug they could hang out on and be more comfortable than on hardwood floor of our kitchen extension. My daughter just turned 6. She likes to sit or lie on it and draw. My 3 year old son likes to set up his 3-D Hotwheels tracks and ramps on top of the rug. Nobody wants to play with the freaking thing the way it was meant to be played with."
5,Good Design,I bought this for my 6 year old son and he loves playing with it. He had another car play mat that I bought for him years ago and it was maybe 3x5 feet. He out grew it so I got him this one. What I really like about it is that it is narrow and long. He doesn't have to step over or reach too far across to get to the other side as he would have to if the mat's diameter was too large. Is nice when 2 kids are playing--they have plenty of space wothout knocking into eachother or climbing over eachother.
3,"Not for use on carpets, better on hard floor surface","This is a beautiful road rug, but I have carpet throughout my house and in my childs room. The rug seems to move everytime we play or step on it. Since the rug was in my childs room and next to his bed, the rug would crawl next to the bed and it would be curled up and lumpy and squished next to his race car bed, which has no underspace. The bed touches the floor, so, the carpet has no place to go but be crumpled up next to the bed. Pitty. So, I'm constantly straightening up the rug to play with it. It's hard when he's standing on the rug. hahaha. But instead, I took the rug to Nana's house and she has a much lower carpet... not the shaggy type of carpet we have, and they play with it in the livingroom. The rug is light enough to roll up and put away, so, not much of a problem there."
4,Fun gift for friend's baby,"This map looked cute on the site, and when it arrived I was thrilled. It has fun ""chunky"" graphics and I like the long rectangular shape. My boyfriend was pleased that we found a non-pastel baby gift that had cars AND an airstrip. Recommended."
4,Smaller than I thought,Purchased as a Christmas gift for a toddler. For the price it is a lot smaller than I thought. I am sure he will enjoy it regardless. Nothing wrong with packaging and product was as advertised.
5,Fantastic,Purchased this for my 2 1/2-year-old grandson. Few things he likes better than cars and trucks and this has been a hit. We love playing on it with the imagination running strong!
3,Just okay. Colors seem washed out.,"The carpet is very large and has a good feel to it. However, the colors seem to be washed out and there is not that much detail. It's like the contrast is too low."
4,Brings me Back,"I used to have one of these carpets as a kid, and although the one I had was much larger, this is a perfect addition to the hallway in my apartment. Everyone that comes over loves it!"
5,Exceeded expectations,"My son loves this carpet! He lays on it and drives his planes, trains, and automobiles all over it. Some dinosaurs have even visited the pond. It exceeded my expectations !!"
5,Super Strap,I have a Nitro Bass Boat and needed replacement straps for my front deck. I found these and they work great and look like the original ones that came on the boat. Easy to install.
4,What a surprise,"I bought this cd b/c I heard ""Cry No More"" a while ago and it was on sale....I was super skeptical but the album really is good. I hope this isn't the last we hear of her since it seems like the women of R&B; have been struggling lately...its just missing some meaning or something. Almost like people can't sing and are stars (Ashanti) or can sing and don't take time to make a quality product (B). I digress...its a good cd, give it a listen.fav tracks:ButterflyHow Good Luv Feels (reminds me of throw-back Mary)Hey BabeEye WonderTrippin"
3,Buen comienzo!,El cd me gustó pero los 2 primeros singles (Need a boss y Cry no more)sobresalen sobre el resto!!!!
4,Cool CD,"Ive always liked ""Need A Boss"" and ""Cry No More"" but after those tracks came out I forgot about her. Then I heard her ""Diamond Girl"" remix (go to her myspace) and thought -- oh yeah Shareefa! What happened?Got the CD and Im feeling it. I personally love Shareefa's voice because it is gritty and she sings so powerfully. Or rather she sings with emotion. But if youre into ""Hip Hop Soul"" -- you know artists like Sunshine Anderson, Alicia Keys (from her first album), Keyshia Cole and people like that -- well you would appreciate this album. You have to be an R&B; head for real.Tracks I like:1. Need A Boss2. Cry No More3. Phony4. Fevah (He Dont Know)5. AssumptionsNo One Said and Butterfly are decent too.This album could be better, but it isnt garbage. If its on sale, which is probably is considering that Im writing this in 2008, then definitely get it! But I definitely cant wait until her new album."
3,She shows some promise,"Shareefa - Point of No Return (Def Soul, 2006)When I first read that Shareefa's Disturbing tha Peace label described her Point of No Return album as a ""soul classic"", I rolled my eyes and was like, ""Yeah, right."" Then my wife picked up this album and as I listened to it, I saw that it really wasn't that bad.The first couple of songs are garbage but then comes ""Butterfly"", a nice-moving song. After that is ""How Good Luv Feels"", which is another smooth track. The rest of the album is hit or miss but the last song, ""Fevah (He Don't Know)"" is pretty exceptional. Shareefa has been described as a poor man's Mary J. Blige (the fact that Chucky Thompson, Blige's old producer, does a few songs here doesn't help matters), but in some songs she reminds me of Keyshia Cole and in ""Phony"", she sounds like Jaguar Wright. It would help her a lot if her producers make her come a little more original the next time around, if there is one. -EJR"
5,"The funniest, most honest book about sports ever written.","I never wanted this book to end and couldn't stop myself from finishing it. I received many strange looks from people as I grabbed my side and laughed out loud at Dan Jenkin's comic masterpiece. I couldn't help myself. Adding to the hilarity is the fact that the events and characters are all too real in the world of sports. The puritanical may be offended. Swearing and sex are a part of big time sports. I'm jealous of everyone, sports fan and non sports fan, who will be reading this book for the first time. You will not be disappointed."
4,"A few from the bar rail, inside the press box.",Dan Jenkins is at his best when he's making fun of himself.You Gotta Play Hurt appears to be based on Jenkins'time at Sports Illustrated. I've heard the characters are based on very real folks.It's funny...and most of it apears to be true!!
4,Shabbat Board Book,"My 15 month old son loves this book. It is very simple yet captures the feel of the Sabbath. He identifies the candles, challah and wine. Yet it is short enough to keep his attention. We read it over and over again, several times a day. We first borrowed this book from the library so now I am ordering him his own copy to read on Shabbat."
2,80% OK,One of the 5 bags had the wrong size hole punched in it - about an eighth of an inch too big - so it didn't fit. Bag was unopened. Really wierd - how could this happen?
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"Received exactly ONE item - not the multi-pack as described. Petco blamed Amazon, Amazon blamed Petco. Payment was refunded, but trust in Amazon and Petco lost."
5,Rating needs to be updated,"It is unfortunate that ratings from 2010 still dominate the ratings for this item. The listing now specifically says 25 count and that is exactly what I received the first time I ordered these. I had no fear ordering these regardless of the negative postings, as Amazon is an amazing site and stands by its products.By the way, my Belgian Shepard, Cooper, loves these things and they are a welcome change from pig ears. Giving him these to chew following his regular, weight-watching meal keeps his teeth clean and extends his 'eating' experience."
2,only got 1 instead of 25 pcs,"however the dogs went crazy for these. I'll probably order more in the future if I can find a good deal. Fyi, they are pig snouts, so if you are squeemish...*Petco did refund my money, so all is good."
2,Good product but bad math skills,"Dog loved the treat, but I ordered 3 packages of 25 each for a total of 75 pieces. I recieved 3 pieces. I did get a refund after complaining, but think they need a calculator."
1,Bad business. Order cancelled by the supplier. Never received them.,I was notified that there was a mistake in price so my order was cancelled right away by the supplier. I never received my item.
1,Bad Business Practice byPetco and Amazon.com,"I decided to try these because they had a very nice offer for a 25 count.I purchased and paid for the Snozzles and awaited my package to arrive.A few days later, instead of my package arriving I received an email stating this they do not carry the Merrick Snozzles Pork Chew Dog Treat in a 25 pack.Well if you don't carry it then why is it still listed on Amazon.com's website.In my opinion either Petco or Amazon.com should have honored this sale.They did not and shame on them."
5,So cool,I got one for my friends b-day and I have been borrowing it since! there is also the cat and dino version
5,Better than a real pet,I would have to say that this is the best thing ever to hit the online store or factories. It is way better than taking care of a real pet because it doesn't leave a huge mess and you have to clean after. I would recommend this to people who are thinking of taking care of a pet and needs practice doing it.
5,The Next Step,"I own all of Bert Ligon's books. He has a way of explaining complex applications to musical situations that I haven't found in other books. I recommend Jazz Theory Resources Volume 2 to any instrumentalist that wants to take the next step in their musical development and have fun while doing it. Quartal harmony, side stepping, triadic superimposition thru simple blues analysis and 11-7,V7,1 exercises......it's all there. Great for reference manual, highly recommended. Dick Foss"
5,Excellent Reference,"As an instructor, I'm continually searching for new and different ways to present material. The material in this book is written from the ground up, which means it starts with fundamentals and builds up to complete methodology for designing analog circuits. Included are data sheets from that era, how to extract parameters and use real data in a design. This is a gem, and remains relevant 30+ years after publication."
2,16 month lifetime is too short,"Like mentioned in another review, the pedal mechanism to open the lid broke -- in my case after 16 months -- Too long to be replaced under warranty, but too short for a product of quality. In this case this was a household with two adults and no children -- so excessive or rough use was not the problem. The lug that secures the pedal to the lid mechanism is plastic. After too much cyclic stress it appears to have worn out and broke. Another complaints (as also mentioned in other reviews) is that the capacity is too small relative to the size of a standard US tall kitchen bag. Pros include an attractive clean design, and good operation (up to the time it broke)."
4,Be carefull of what you get. My review is for the 30 liter model cw 1109,"My model is different. It is cw1109 and is 30 liter. I ended up getting mine for $59 at bed, bath and beyond. I opted for the 30 liter can with the stainless steel top. It is supposed to hold 8 gallons. I'm giving this a 4 star because standard bags in the US are not the same size as Liters. I'm using 13 gal draw string bags. When ever I empty my trash I always end up putting something else in it so I'm not wasting the bag. I really wanted the 45 liter one with the butterfly opening but it is priced around $179 and I couldn't justify the cost. This brand is good. Simplehuman has a nice liner, and opens and closes nicely so you really don't have hold the lid open. No smell and you don't have to touch your own trash. My kitchen can't accomodate an under the sink trash bin, so this do nicely. BTW the stainless steel ones with the bag-ring holders will drive you crazy."
2,Not very durable,"The peddle on mine broke after 6 months. Just two adults, no rough treatment. Another thing to keep in mind, stainless is hard to keep clean. Shows dirt and finger prints badly."
2,"Ok can, bad design.","As others have said, they lever bar on the bottom is secured with a single screw into plastic. This is not enough to hold it without sripping the plastic. Superglue ended up fixing it. Also, they do use a metal rod conencted to the plastic lid. This also will break with time and there is no replacement. Be careful about their warranty. While it is warrantied for 10 years, if they no longer carry the same one, they will attempt to find a similar one. In my case they wanted to downgrade me to a smaller unit. They also offered credit for another purchase. I just didn't want to spend the extra $100 to get back to the same size trash can."
3,Nice but Cheap Pedal,"We bought this can about 2 yrs ago and have gone through 2 pedals. Is it worth throwing away 70bucs every 2yrs for a garbage can? Seems pricey to me.Plus, the fingerprints make it look pretty ugly. Those of you who have purchased this item know because the pedal will break and theres only one way to get it open. So then you have a dirty looking trash can that doesnt work and now you must clean it every 3.5 seconds to keep guests from using their cake and ice cream forks to open it up!"
2,Plastic instead of steel,"Tired of that year-and-half old kitchen can? Don't worry, you'll be replacing it momentarily. As noted in a previous post, this can is built to outlast the warranty. Barely. Levers once made of steel are now plastic and garbage dumps are filling with Simplehuman waste."
3,Jenny's Review,I own a Lexmark 3200 printer and ink is totally expensive. It doesn't last very long either.
5,"Hot, hot guy","i might seem like a groupie but that boy has something to him... i wish i could see him live, cause listening to that music AND watching him... how perfect!"
3,Good book about numerous war movies,"Legendary War Movies is a good book full of interesting facts about countless war movies throughout movie history. Covering such famous ones as Battleship Potempkin to Apocalypse Now, from Bridge on the River Kwai to Birth of a Nation, this book does cover most of the well known war movies. However, it leaves out several notables including The Great Escape, Kelly's Heroes, A Bridge too Far, and several others of my favorites. Another interesting aspect of the book was the quizzes you could take about which war a movie was about, famous lines, stars' careers before the movies, and a couple others. This isn't the definitive book about war movies, but it is very enjoyable with plenty of facts about our favorite war movies."
5,beware the ape woman!,"More than once I've had fun watching Captive Wild Woman, Jungle Woman, and Jungle Captive. The beautiful Acquanetta plays Paula Dupree the ape woman in the first two films of the series. The lovely Acquanetta wasn't in the last movie of the trilogy, but we did get Rondo Hatton in that one so that was a treat! I love all these ape woman movies!"
2,Mediocre horror film with too many stock shots,Unlike Maltin I find this film no fun. It's too mechanical and riddled with cliches. It's as though some studio executive told a script writer to frame some cock and bull story around shots of Clyde Beatty doing his animal training acts in an old movie made in the thirties
1,not true to size and very see-through,These claim to be 4x. I am a 2X and hoped to have a roomy night gown. They arrived and were skin tight and see through. I kept trying to give them away to skinny people all of whom found them to be such a stretchy fabric that they didn't think they would be comfortable sleeping in them. And what do you do with a night gown that shows you every curve and blemish. Too bad. They are soft.
2,SIZE,"THE SHOE IS VERY CUTE, BUT WHEN I RECEIVED IT THE HEEL ON ONE OF THE SHOES DID NOT FIT CORRECTLY WITH THE ADDED SOLE ON THE HEEL AND THERE WAS A GAP BETWEEN THEM. ALSO, I AM NORMALLY AN 8 1/2 AND I ORDERED A SIZE 8 JUST IN CASE. WHEN I TRIED IT ON THE SHOE WAS STILL ONE SIZE TOO BIG. CUTE IF YOU GET ONE THATS NOT MADE POORLY AND FITS."
5,this book is fine but amazon is sucks,"i like this bookbut amazon sucks,i think amazon is not good and fair to me.amazon would not let me sell my book back that is not fair to me!"
5,Great text for Class and Lab,"I have been teaching TCP/IP and internetworking at the college level for three years now. I have reviewed dozens of books as potential texts. Chappell's book is the first I have found that combines the theory with practical laboratory-type experiences - and even includes a free, workable version of the sniffer used in her examples (Etherpeek).Combine this with a good Cisco IOS book and you have a complete course. Thanks Laura."
2,Beware! No Answers and No Errata!,"Please be aware that this book is published to be used as a TEXTBOOK for college (or trade schools) and thus the answers to problems, labs, etc are available ONLY to INSTRUCTORS. It is thus terrible for self-study or for certification preparation. Furthermore, neither the authors nor the publisher has produced a listing of errata, so you are on your own if something seems wrong but you do not yet possess the knowledge to determine whether the book is in error or not."
